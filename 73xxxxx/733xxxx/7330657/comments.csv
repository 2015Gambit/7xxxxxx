Joe Elliott on the Colbert Report[12-07-18]: ""Our music is not available on, uh,  any digital domain [...] because it's an issue with the record label"" 
I downloaded this only to take the mick out of their shitty rip-off artist label -never heard of them before

Music sounds very fine, for a wonder, like that style. The quality of the files is supreme,  nothing to criticize about that. Really some well-arranged data.

The speed of that torrent is exceedingly fast, thank you very much sidecookie

Don't forget to seed, everyone!"
