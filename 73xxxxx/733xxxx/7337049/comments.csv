Do you ever feel like the eyes of a portrait might be following you across the room? Or, did you notice that a pen has mysteriously shifted from the location you last placed it? Sure, it could be a coincidence...or it could be paranormal. Ghosts and spirits inhabit more than just homes and buildings - they can live in objects, too. This summer, John Zaffis and his family are on a mission to ease your suspicions.
