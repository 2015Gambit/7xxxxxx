Every title, album name, artist etc. is correctly done by myself, including album cover, everything implanted in the songs. And a extra album cover picture.

The tracks are unreleased but still available if you look for a specific song.

I know that this is The Pirate Bay but if you enjoy his music in any way you should really support him, I would recommend to visit one of his shows if you have the chance.

So this means that this is WORK he may collect money from in the future so everything is licensed under Joel Zimmerman even if he haven't claimed it, yet.

Tho, this is still The Pirate Bay so nobody cares.

Anyway, I hope you you enjoy the music and I will make a volume 2 on popular demand!
