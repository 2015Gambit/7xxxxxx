This is a collection of movies and shorts films I received because I visited several NKnet seminars in Seoul. I have done the best I could to get subtitles for whatever movies were available.

Unfortunately, I was unable to rip 3 of the 12 films.

Here is a list of the films I have available:

1) Crossing ~ 112 minutes
2) Dooman River ~ 93 minutes
3) Kimjongilia ~ 76 minutes
4) Ryang Kangdo: Merry Christmas, North! ~ 95 minutes
5) Winter Butterfly ~ 90 Minutes
6) Soncha ~ 23 minutes
7) Inside ~ 20 minutes
8) North Korea VJ ~ 40 minutes
9~11) Not available, sorry >_<
12) A collection of clips not available for subs

If I'm ever able to get all movies, I'll reupload this torrent with a link in the future.  Please use this to get informed about all the evil which is being done in the North. And if you feel inclined to do so, do research in N. Korean NGO's and donate money to them.

If you believe in God, or more specifically in Jesus Christ, please pray for them because they are in need of your prayers!

Peace! V/_
