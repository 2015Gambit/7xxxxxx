,Migukin,2012-06-06T03:07Z,"@Nniikk Trolling isn't welcome anywhere online. You should know better than that.

For some reason, the uploading is slow (and I have a fast data connection) so I would like it if people can try to seed this as much as possible.

There are a lot of good movies in here and if people can try to seed as much as possible that would be great.  Thanks guys!"
,Nniikk,2012-06-06T22:05Z,sorry my intention was simply to say that whithaut support from un nothing gonna change
,dearhongkong,2012-06-19T14:10Z,Thanks very much for the upload Migukin :)
,ShiroUnlimited,2012-07-03T11:13Z,Is it all English subbed? :)
,Migukin,2012-07-03T15:14Z,"@Shiro Unlimited, As mentioned before, all the video files from the 12th disc are not subbed.  Can't do anything about that.
I double-checked, and one more is not English subbed I haven't mentioned, Disc 8 - North Korea VJ. Can't do anything about that either, I think.

However, I promise you it won't hurt you if you can't understand them, you'll still get a better contextual understanding of North Korea by watching them, even one or two of these films.

Please get the word out about these, and seed these for a little longer.  I'm doing what I can, but can't always because I'm doing it from a laptop which is connected to my external hard drive.  Can't keep it plugged in all the time!

Hope that helps and that these videos are educational for you!"
,AlexLibman,2012-08-15T19:25Z,"All governments are ultimately in the same boat, and it makes perfect sense that a state of collusion would exist even between a least tyrannical government and a most tyrannical.  The governments of USA, Russia, China, France, and even Switzerland all depend on the same ""divine rights"" as the government of North Korea.  Inter-governmental institutions like the United Nations are not paragons of peace and freedom, they are merely the instruments of this collusion.

The force that makes all nations less unfree is the force of undeniable scientific truths (including economics and technology) that governments are powerless to stop.  There is a limit to how much they can censor and manipulate the truth, and access to self-evident truths is becoming easier than ever.  It will soon be impossible to prevent people in North Korea from accessing the Internet and getting objective truth about the way they live.

It wasn't the United Nations that brought down the Soviet Empire (the country of my birth).  It wasn't God, it wasn't the Reagan buildup, and it wasn't any of the poor heroic dissidents within.  Communism was a horrendous failure, but only in relative terms - such a failure can be perpetuated indefinitely if left in a vacuum.  What made USSR fall (and reform into a lesser tyranny of Putin) was the inevitability of cross-cultural communication.  People wanted bluejeans (to quote a cliche) and rock'n'roll and cars like in the West.  The same fate awaits North Korea as well.

If I had a few million dollars to spare, I'd build a robotized cargo delivery system that can launch flying devices from international waters.  Those devices would fly over North Korea, split into smaller modules, and parachute down food and cheap laptops (with pre-loaded books and censorship-resistant mesh networking) onto thousands of villages.  Of course they'd be trying to shoot them down (and I wouldn't be surprised if Uncle Sam's military would collude to help them), and the brainwashed and fearful citizens of North Korea would demonstratively stomp on them to show their loyalty to the state...  But some will inevitably get through, fueling an ever-growing underground network of intellectual resistance, and planting the seeds of civil disobedience that will eventually bring down the state!"
,Migukin,2012-08-23T19:02Z,"Alex, thanks for your insight.

Dropping things into North Korea from the air is already being done. To what extent, I do not know.  What I can tell you is that different NGO's are releasing things into the air via balloons and are dropping Bibles to read the Word of God, socks to be worn during the cold winter (and exchanged for food), and snacks.  More can always be done, but if you want you can help organizations in Korea or China that send in food and clothes, or build a support base and make your own!

Research on Google: leaflets, north korea, balloon, ngo

Help out these NGO's today!"
