,Lalalalalaaaaa,2012-06-25T22:23Z,"Hey guys, can someone try to help me out over here? 

I'm usually great with this kind of thing and followed all of the instructions but every time I double click the Sweet Treats icon to start playing, it brings up the Sims 3 launcher and tells me ""Unable to connect to Origin."" 

The image is mounted and I copied the contents from the ""Fairlight"" folder to my ""The Sims 3"" folder. Maybe I'm just not finding the right folder? 

Help is very much appreciated!"
,Ing99,2012-06-26T00:43Z,"hey, I have a problem after the scrolling text finishes on sims and I have come to the main menu it pops up a message that says this is not a valid copy of the game. Anybody that can help me?
