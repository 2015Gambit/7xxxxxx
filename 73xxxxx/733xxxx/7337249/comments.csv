[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-06-08T05:19Z,name some? wait what's that? u cant? didnt think so :)
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-06-08T05:23Z,oh keep in mind sega genesis and mega drive are the same system. it was renamed for america for some reason...forgot why.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-06-08T10:43Z,there is more games in this collection here than both the ones I found else ware so there cannot be many.

,hopedeny,2012-06-08T17:11Z,"I assure you. This is far from a comprehensive list. The sega roms alone would be far larger, not even to mention 32x."
,hopedeny,2012-06-08T17:11Z,"er. genesis, not sega."
,DarkSilhouette,2012-06-08T17:42Z,"Far from a comprehensive list? this is fuctup that upped and compiled this and he does the best ROM and Emu compiles on entire web, you dont like it? go make your own Emu torrent then!

Freaking great work as usual Fuct! +1"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-06-09T08:49Z,"thanks DarkSilhouette. it's all the same guy using different accounts...idiots do that from time to time i've noticed.

@hopedeny might try downloading it homie. after extracting it is FAR larger. i compress the SHIT out of my uploads when i can."
,Alainlb,2012-06-09T16:34Z,"I remember we weren't rich enough to afford a Sega Mega drive when I was little so I had to settle for a Nintendo ( not sure whats its officially called, the one that came with super Mario and tank on it ).

Thank you for this torrent, even if it doesn't include every game ever ( and I have no reason to believe it doesn't ) it's still the result of a formidable effort, heck it's almost an entire era of gaming bundled in a 550 MB torrent! and it definitely deserves appreciation, so thanks again! 

GREAT TORRENT!

I really like the idea of every version but a lot of these are being transferred to my wii where space in limited."
