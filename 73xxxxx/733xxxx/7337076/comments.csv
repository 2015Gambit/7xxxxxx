,Fritz.,2012-06-08T05:51Z,"
good audio and video.

the movie is horrible though. its not really funny, and its supposed to be like all the nonsense leads up to the point at the end... but its just dumb.


oh and before some dumb shit is like ""hurr durr its free"", it doesnt make the movie good, nor does it reflect on the uploader that the movie sucks. get a grip"
,K1bbler,2012-06-08T06:39Z,There is nothing wrong with the movie. I can understand why you don't like it though because it isn't your moronic superbad humor movie. You are an intellectual infant and your opinions express as much.
,desmitis,2012-06-08T07:34Z,thank you.
,klip1,2012-06-08T11:24Z,"lol @ k1bbler

thnx for the up extremezone da' masta'"
,B.Torrents,2012-06-08T12:34Z,Thanks Mate...
,Fritz.,2012-06-08T14:12Z,"lol, i just believe life is what you make it, and not some series of random signs you just follow along while you meander pointlessly along.

only some dumb stoner, like in the movie, would believe life is going to magically work itself out in some kind of miracle because you just followed some stupid imaginary signs.

if you want a wonderful life you have to work for it and make it happen, it doesnt magically just happen through some cosmic force.

someone who thinks this is good is obviously detached from reality."
,Fritz.,2012-06-08T14:27Z,"and thats just beside the fact that the main character is a 30 year old man who dwells in his moms basement while he smokes pot.

if anything the movie should be called ""Jeff : dont let this happen to you!"""
,dubblue4,2012-06-08T15:48Z,thanks

For movies though, we need some kind of plot device, and in this one, it's Hollywood stoner logic. Watching real stoners for 90 minutes would be far less entertaining."
[T],MrLore,2012-06-08T22:17Z,"Good rip, bad movie. I agree with Henry Fitzherbert:

Nothing much happens until a preposterously contrived and melodramatic climax."

,freeforlife,2012-06-09T00:46Z,"Good movie and video Q.And there are signs in life and they are called synchronicity,just open your mind and you will see them also.

,klip1,2012-06-09T04:31Z,I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A FUCKING IDIOT
,Negligence,2012-06-09T06:18Z,"i'm confused either its good or bad, you people suck lol now i have to watch it"
,Negligence,2012-06-09T07:58Z,"All in all a pretty decent watch imo, nothing special but still worth a go. I don't see any reason to shit talk it and call it a terrible movie. Considering some of the crap I've seen being spoon fed to the population, I didn't mind this at all.

,TtToker,2012-06-10T02:17Z,"Great quality, the movie itself was not funny and the story was honestly not worth following. you may enjoy it, I didn't.. Thank Extremezone!"
,sandman1234,2012-06-10T02:21Z,When will people like Fritz realize that movies are made for entertainment?! They are not made to compare with a real life.
,Teshin,2012-06-10T04:56Z,I have the same problem as you... @ pookiemc2 
,The_Human,2012-06-10T06:30Z,Great quality and decent movie. It's different.
,deathbymarblz,2012-06-10T10:01Z,Honestly some of the people here seriously should stop whining like little girls if they didn't like the movie. Sure it wasn't amazing and didn't have that great of a story but that doesn't mean you have to write paragraphs and multiple posts explaining why you think it sucked. overall i think it was pretty good and the messages behind it were good and it dealt with a lot of different real life issues. In my opinion the video/sound quality was perfectly fine and i didn't notice anything wrong with it.
,k.kolarec,2012-06-10T10:18Z,This is one of the worst movies ever. I don't unterstand how it can be in top 10. Just becouse its diferent doesn't mean its good.
,meowmeow92,2012-06-10T12:38Z,Why do ppl incessantly rate dvd rips? It's dvd quality and the compression doesn't change it in anyway visually and aurally comparable from one rating to the next; just fucking stop it. Te amount of seeders judges if the quality is satisfactory. Even rating TS movies is annoying coz that's just subjective anyhow.

,XONi49,2012-06-19T05:23Z,"this file has a lot of pixelation issues other than that its good

@Alobarku - avi are more versatile then mp4 mkv files and tend to give better re-encoding results to people that re-code files them selves to suit their needs if you dont like avis then make your own files and stop complaining about free downloads "
