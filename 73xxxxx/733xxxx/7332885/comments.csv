,Razdagar,2012-06-06T19:27Z,"Thanks for the effort! But it looks like it's filmed with a piece of toast. A 6/ V4

Anyway, cams are going to be hard for this movie, because the whole movie is very dark."
,HowHigh1,2012-06-06T23:54Z,"So Far May Be Best Copy. 
V-5 / A-5
Razdagar Is Correct, Allot Of The Movie Is Dark. Its The Lighted Scenes Where You See How Bad The Cam Is. But If You Cant wait...
When It Comes Out In The States You'll Find One Filmed With An HD Cam After A Week Or So.
 I Can Tell Its A Decent Movie For Sci-Fi Fans."
