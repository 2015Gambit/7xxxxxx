,dappadon,2012-06-05T20:37Z,"why be a hater, froggie;s one of the best , it clearly states it's not a very good copy it just gives peeps who can't wait a chance to watch it"
,Beetlejuicexx,2012-06-05T20:44Z,"Seriously. This film requires you to go to the cinema / movies / flicks / whatever you;d like to call it, to actually watch it. It's worth more than a download. The scenes are dark, so will look absolutely awful on a cam version. I urge people, if you're going to boycott one cam download this year, let it be this - do your senses a favour - go to the big screen to see this film. I did, and thoroughly enjoyed the movie."

,michaelrwatson,2012-06-07T02:43Z,@mariakhan: why do you post such stupid shit? Is it because you have a small dick and your mom is a whore? And i'll bet you never knew your father. Sad.
,.net_ish,2012-06-07T09:47Z,thnx froggie
,michaelrwatson,2012-06-07T22:22Z,"@Piratebay: Can you please somehow disallow links in posts (except perhaps to imdb.com or piratebay.se)..?

These assholes are really overwhelming the comments on a lot of posts these days (e.g. see above on this page). Thanks."
,birdmw,2012-06-08T09:08Z,@beetlejuicexx And if we have a projector?
,tduckin,2012-06-08T14:16Z,The missing scene at the end of the credits where the new Alien pops out of the engineer. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7338829/Prometheus_Proto_Alien_.mp4
,Vorajed,2012-06-09T00:36Z,"i enjoyed the movie, it's dark and it's connected to Aliens movie as well.
also to see it in better quality check out film.gingerstark.com respect!"
,c6burns,2012-06-09T20:45Z,"Dont listen to the people urging you to go to the theatre. Yes there are lots of dark scenes but yes this movie is a waste of money. Sure, it's better than most films in theatre currently, but that doesn't make it great. First 1/2 of movie is solid and last 1/2 is somewhat of a let-down.

Enjoy some russian idiot eating potato chips beside the cam and save your money for an awesome movie :D"
,c6burns,2012-06-09T20:47Z,Also cepoks is a robot ... he says every film is perfect. This film is barely a 7/10 ... and I am the hugest fan of the Aliens series ... Im not just makin this shit up :)
,Capt.Scarlet,2012-06-10T18:00Z,Agree Hole heartedly with Beetlejuicexx. 
,hima220,2012-06-12T00:35Z,"v:3

great SF movie but with bad quality :(
to see it in better quality check movie.fnsgr.com and enjoy as i did!"
,tuomaspap,2012-06-13T23:07Z,"seriously ... people that think this film is crap should stop watching sci fi movies period! . Its ok .. not everyone is bright enough to put 1 and 1 together, or to use there mind to figure things out on their own without having the film explain everything to them like children ..its okk .. seriously ;)"
,pt.,2012-06-28T23:40Z,"I dont download movies from cam.
If they dont do that most likely we dont have problems with the authoritys.
at least to allow them make same money.then we make the share when came to dvd.
But thats your shoice.Tanks."
