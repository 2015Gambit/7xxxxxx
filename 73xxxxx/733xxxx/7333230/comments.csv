,pro4one,2012-06-06T20:47Z,"Hi I found new way to play the game without patch 1.0.0.22

1.COPY AND PASTE THE RELOADED CRACK TO THE MAIN FOLDER OF MAX PAYNE 3
2. DISCONNECT FROM YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION
3. RUN PLAYMAXPAYME 3 (LAUNCHER)
4.IT WILL FAIL THE UPDATE OF PATCH 1.0.0.22
5. PRESS PLAY OFFLINE
6. SELECT YOUR PROFILE THAN HOME
7. IF IT IS YOUR FIRST TIME U WILL CANNOT PLAY CAUSE U NEED CONNECTION TO CREATE PROFILE

,assfacefromhell,2012-06-07T00:01Z,"I think these game developers have gotten a bit out of hand with how they name their version numbers. I mean v1.0.0.22, come on really? How about just uhm, ""version 1.1"". Eventually we'll have v1.0.0.0.0.0.1 updates."
,xaxax,2012-06-07T00:07Z,"These cracks are all fucking garbage.
I expect this level of fail from RELOADED, not THETA.

And I hope Rockstar burns in hell for this fucking shitty DRM. If they hadn't used gay DRM and put it on GOG I'd probably buy it after tyring it if it's not a consolized piece of shit like most the other games."
,pirateGRC,2012-06-07T00:30Z,works for me.
,pirateGRC,2012-06-07T00:35Z,"Works with RELOADED release after I already applied REALOADED's Updates, profile, dlc and Crack. I had already start playing the game too and I have no problem. I play offline and stay offline while playing.

1. Install the patch MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22
2. Copy over the contents of the /Crack dir to your installation
directory

NOTES

* This release does not include any previous patches, thus should be used only after v1.0.0.17 patch is installed.

CHANGELOG

* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodgeï¿½. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu).
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu.
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available. Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards)."

,OmniNegro,2012-06-07T13:51Z,"Why do the trolls always claim there is a virus because their retarded antiviral software says so? 

The answer is that they are fully fooled by the stupid antiviral shit that has a vested interest in making you think everything may be a virus.

scene4all does not release virii. And Theta does not either.

Grow up and realize that 99% of actual virii are missed by your shitty antiviral software. They are however notorious for false positives. 

Use something fully free and open sourced like Clamwin instead of the scumbag commercial AV crap that takes over your system and motivates you to feel afraid so you will pay them for their shit.

If a virus were the letters ABCD, then the AV would miss it if it were changed to ABDC. That is a fact. 

They have a list of strings that are known viruses. However just because something matches something they have a string for, that in no way means it is actually a virus. It simply *MAY BE* a virus."

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the nstructions from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)

,RafVne2,2012-06-24T11:44Z,"Hi there guys.
I figured I'll lend a ... no fuck it.... I'll tell you what I did and seems to be working fine...
After Installation I allowed the game to connect and update itself, t installed 0.17 update 0.95 something rockstar then it updated 0.22 patch...
it updated fine, and hy shouldn't it right, you haven't done anything yet with the files. So it treats it as a legit fine copy...
AFTER the updates i shut it down from taskmgr, and then I copied profile and crack files + THEN I've blocked an access to the internet.
Now to be fair, I did install everything from those files here before, so maybe after I've uninstalled the hole thing the fix was still in there, but I had to do it cauz' something got screwed up and my keyboard stopped working when I started the game.
So updating works, but the patch didn't fix my sond crackling issue, can anyone help me out on that one? ( i did update sound drivers from realtek)

Oh and please note the date. It's 2012-06-24 now, why? Because they may add some auto updates which this crack won't cover, in other words, don't be stupid and watch what you do. Don't let updates install on it's own 6 months from now and expect it to still be a 0.22 version (which this crack covers).

Hey, and thanks for the up man, to you and the groups involved."
,RafVne2,2012-06-24T22:24Z,Lil' update... so the keyboard not working thing happened again so now I don't know but something got screwed up even though the first time install I followed all the steps. maybe comodo didn't block it first time or something... anyone is having this kind of problems? Found a fix? If you don't mind help me a out a bit here
,RafVne2,2012-06-25T08:49Z,"Hmmm... one more update :)
The keyboard thing... it's working fine. It was a god damned comodo. Don't get me wrong it's a great program and free too, but all I wanted was firewall that's what I chose, but it installed some ""defence+"" anyways, and it blocked maxpaine from accessing anything, including keyboard.
So my first sugestion is still valid if anyone cares. 
take care."
,RafVne2,2012-06-25T10:11Z,"And one last thing...
@ omni...
... dude, really?! I mean.. you threw shit at that freak guy for what? Because he believes that files are laced with virus? Come on he's pissed and he is expressing that. Not the best way sometimes. it would have been more believable if he just calmly said what he found, but hey if his AV did find something whether it was a false pos or not, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO ADVISE PPL ABOUT YOUR FINDINGS. lET OTHERS DECIDE ON THEIR OWN, having more info might just save you some cleaning time because you took one extra step to protect yourself when run something...
... I mean come on, I'm not trying to give you shit... well I guess I kind of am ain't I? he he he... wasn't the intention, I'm just fed up sometimes hearing the same two sides on each torrent... 
-""it has a virus... ""...
-""no it doesn't it's a false pos...""
I personally am leaning toward your conviction, that AV business isn't the product, but the FEAR is. They scare poor old folkes with some scrary report saying they've got all kinds of shit....
You wanna hear what I did... I said fuck it, uninstalled my AV shit and never looked back. Haven't had a problem since, and PC begun running much better. I just run from time to time an online scan, and one of the anti-adware progs. All my Av was doing was deleting fucking cracks,and yet if there was something out there it never stopped shit, besides what the fuck do I really have to loose. I've got nothing, anyone would want,  and to clean up some piece of asware is much less problematic then uninstall some of those AVs. I got this comodo firewall not for security, bt so my shit won't call ""Home""
... ehhhh... i'm sorry dude I don't know why I've said what I've said, I guess there was something building up there :)....

Yeah... I'm better now.... :)
