This is my compilation of Shadowrun 4th Edition pdf e-books Mark-001, it is NOT complete, but it is as close as I could get to it for now. As far 

as I am aware, I am missing 26 books (both books included and ones I couldn't find are listed by category in List of Books.txt which also 

includes where I got them from). If you know where to find any books I have missed, please let me know, thank you.
