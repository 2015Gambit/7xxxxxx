,wisprr,2012-07-29T20:41Z,"Thanks Hard_8, I appreciate it. I've also purchased 4 new Shadowrun pdf files from http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com but don't want to create a new torrent for just adding a few more books. When I reach 10 new I'll create a new torrent with the additional books in it. I've also redid the directory structure so it is a lot cleaner. I would like some opinions, should I only upload the new books or the entire thing again?"
