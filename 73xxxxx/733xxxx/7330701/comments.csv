,willytakum,2012-06-07T00:45Z,hello......i'm stuck at 96.9%.....TVTeam?  Hellllllooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!
,willytakum,2012-06-07T00:53Z,I'm wondering if i should contact TPB and tell them this is an incomplete torrent? Maybe they can contact you and get this resolved???Tried stopping/starting torrent...no availe...
,willytakum,2012-06-07T00:56Z,"Don't bother downloading this...it's incomplete...stops at 96.9% and nothing helps...tried stopping/starting, using BitComet...newest version...it's another TV Team fuck-up..."
,willytakum,2012-06-07T01:10Z,don't bother...just another TVTeam fuck-up...WTF guys????? Stuck @96.9% there has to be another uploader for this...seriously guys...i know it's free but wasting that much time really makes me want to use ANYONE ELSE's TORRENT...and you advertise your new site and then you don't give a way in without payment? You Suck and I'm reporting this....you don't share...you sell... and i hope you get what you deserve...sell-outs
,willytakum,2012-06-07T07:18Z,Like so many others you get an ICON from TPB and immediatly go to shit...too many uploads makes Jack a fuck-up...ck your fucking torrents BEFORE you upload asshole...you're not providing a service if it doesn't work...Period. I'm not new at this...just new with you...but you can bet your ass i won't be back and i have an extensive network that will be told that my grandma puts out better uploads when she uses the toilet...
,willytakum,2012-06-07T07:21Z,"don't bother...dead at 96.9%...movie skips and is pixilated everywhere...Of course it does, of course it is...the torrent is incomplete...its total crap"
,willytakum,2012-06-07T07:23Z,just another TVTeam fuck-up...thought i would try ONE more from them because they USED to be the shit...now they're just shit...
,willytakum,2012-06-07T07:27Z,just another TVTeam fuck-up...thought i would try ONE more from them because they USED to be THE shit...now they're just shit...time to retire assholes...or hire some help cause you ain't cuttin' it...I hear Barnes and Noble are hiring...maybe you should look there...tvteam
,willytakum,2012-06-07T07:31Z,do you know why I'm the only one making comments? because no one else is stupid enough to try another one of your fuck-ups...when your numbers dwindle to nothing cause folks are tired of you spamming TPB...Maybe then you'll consider a real job cause your sponsers are gonna run like rats leaving a sinking ship
,Ireton_06,2012-06-08T04:55Z,"Wily, calm down, I'm sure TVTeam didn't mean to mess up, his/her torrents are pretty far out (good) and I respect this, be thankful that he uploaded part 1 in the 1st place.

But TVTeam, he's right though, I've been stuck at 96.9 for 2 days, is there a way you could correct this please? Part 2/3 worked wonderfuly"
