,Rasengan25,2012-07-14T15:29Z,What Does It Mean To Seed????? Why is it imprtant
,liquo_the_wolf,2012-07-30T21:54Z,"PLEASE SOMEBODY SEED THIS! im a great seeder, ratio of 25 before i even think about deleting pls somebody seed. also @rasengan25, seeding is what torrent clients do when they are done downloading, torrents work by having other peoples computers upload files to other users instead of having them on a server like most download website, torrenting is usually faster download times and there are more things to download. id explain the whole thing but you probably dont want to know."
,Seritath,2012-08-25T06:19Z,"Rasegan, seeding is the redistribution of files by uploading them to other computers when you're done. This process is usually automatic, and starts almost as soon as the torrent is done being downloaded. A good policy to keep is to seed as much as possible, but if you find yourself stuck between what to seed and how much to download, try to seed the torrents you see with the fewest seeds or peers first, so that it makes it easier and quicker for other people to download, and in return reseed for others."
