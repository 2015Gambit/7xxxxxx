This show is historical in two ways; first, it was the last show the band played for almost seven years, and the last Judas Priest show with Rob Halford until the 2004 Reunion Tour. Secondly, it was at this show where Rob had his famous motorcycle accident which knocked him out for the duration of opening number Hell Bent for Leather, making it so far the only time in history that this song was played as an instrumental.

Audio source and quality: Audience, excellent quality. I've improved the audio even further from the original, although that sounded great already. Minor audio fluctuations here and there but no problems for the most part....I included both the losless flac version and the mp3 version at 320kbps
