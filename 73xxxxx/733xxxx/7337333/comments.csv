,etensini,2012-06-08T06:37Z,How can i get the language packs? i'm sorry about it.
,macmaverickk,2012-06-08T06:42Z,"Yeah, Im going to upload some languages right now. But I'd give it about 12 hours before they are seeded enough to actually download."

,LimaMike12,2012-06-15T03:44Z,I downloaded the rosetta stone and replaced the mdm.dat file in the resources but when I open it I click on the add a language and it prompts me to insert a disc? Idk what I did wrong? Can someone help me!
,ruvy,2012-06-15T18:23Z,"Thanks macmaverickk and thanks for the languages you've up'd so far.

If you have access to German might I bother you to push that to the hordes??

Thanks!"
,macmaverickk,2012-06-16T05:26Z,"LimaMike12:
         Click ""Continue"" when it prompts to insert a disc. You need to make sure you double click on the iso file (on a mac) before trying to install it.

ruvy:
         German and French will be the next ones up once my current ones are seeded enough for me to move on... which will probably be in a couple hours"
,LotusSeeder,2012-06-16T20:53Z,I'm not the most computer literate person and I need help installing this. I downloaded it and double clicked on everything. Just got a bunch of code? I'm desperate to have this program. please help?
,macmaverickk,2012-06-16T22:19Z,"Okay, well first off, you're on a Mac I'm assuming/hoping. Second, when you double click on any language iso, don't go looking through it, its pointless. Just exit out of the window (but make sure it is still mounted/opened in finder).

Now fully disconnect from the internet (as a precautionary measure to prevent authorizations/registration with Rosetta Stone servers) , open the Rosetta Stone application (which you have successfully dragged to your applications folder and patched correctly). At the top-right, one of the drop down menus (the one next to the question mark) will give you the option to ""Add or Remove Languages"". Click that, and when it says ""Please insert the Language CD in the CD-ROM Drive"", Click Continue. From there, you can select the language you wish to install. If at any point it asks you for product keys, disconnect from the internet, and use this:

Activation code: 
xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx

Phone activation code:
1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111

Copy it exactly as you see it here. It may not work the first time. Just be patient. This does not always work for everyone unfortunately."
,renegadekitten,2012-06-17T11:22Z,Will you be uploading a Japanese language pack? :3
,erinerin1,2012-06-18T00:16Z,"hey all, where can i find the installation instructions? i have the language packs downloaded and partially mounted, just need the instructions for the application. please help, thx"
,erinerin1,2012-06-18T00:19Z,"i downloaded this torrent too, i just cant find the installation instructions. thx macmaverick"
,macmaverickk,2012-06-18T02:47Z,The installation instructions you're looking for are in the LANGUAGE torrents... not this one
,zanyan,2012-06-20T23:54Z,Looking for Japanese!
,Bleuenvert,2012-06-23T00:49Z,Which file should i be replacing? I can't find one in the resource folder thats called mdat . 
,Bleuenvert,2012-06-23T01:07Z,Where do I copy the mdat file? Im looking in the resources folder but can't see any file named mdat to replace :S
,chon69,2012-06-24T17:10Z,"Hi, the conversations on how to activate this software are confusing, Macmaverickk can you offer some more detailed instructions for loading this onto my Macbook Pro?"
,danieleleven,2012-06-24T20:43Z,will this work on windows?
,QBall70,2012-06-28T01:07Z,"UM .... what part of APPLICATIONS > MAC did you NOT understand???

Dude, you're either the most ignorant motherfucker alive or else you're playing games.  Which is it???

Go here:

If you're wanting Rosetta Stone for Windows, you're in the wrong fucking category, dude.  THINK, USE YOUR HEAD.  What I just posted is the link for Windows' Rosetta Stone.

Enough with the stupidity, asshole."
,dd.asf1,2012-07-02T11:55Z,"I could not yet get it...

,crucius,2012-07-31T17:15Z,installation failed on mountain lion on a mid-2010 macbook pro..any workarounds?
,randall5434,2012-08-09T04:50Z,I have downloaded RS program opens and I am able to use it but not to it's entirety. I tried entering in the codes for activation the exact way they were presented and for the phone activation but it keeps telling me that an error has occurred. I tried doing it with my internet shut off as well and same results. Can someone fix this problem for me? I have a Mac if that might make a difference in the response.
,jon714,2012-08-12T17:04Z,Thanks! Beautiful!
,lotusblm,2012-08-15T20:18Z,"All seems to be working well but I have two questions... I only copied the mdm.dat file to the resources folder as there was no file to REPLACE.  Does this suffice or am I missing a piece of the puzzle here? Rosetta opens fine and uploaded the language ISOs fine.  Next, product reg codes are asked for.  I'm offline and so it wants me to either connect or use phone activation... instructions say to stay offline.  How do I navigate this one?  I'm a bit concerned that I did not copy the crack correctly and therefore the activation codes will not work.  Any advice lovely folks?  Thanks!"
,L_t0p0,2012-08-19T02:59Z,"Can Someone Help?

I’d installed another K’d version of Rosetta Stone 3 a while ago. It started getting buggy so I uninstalled it. Now, whenever I try to install a newer version (like this one) the installation fails every time. The only note it gives is to call the software manufacturer.

Does anyone know A) what’s causing this and B) how to fix it?

Thanks!

OS 10.6.7"
,VB2423,2012-08-21T10:53Z,"ok so I got to lesson 3 on a previous d'ld of RS and noticed everything was locked so I came here for some solutions and here is what I did:

1. d'ld this torrent (only for the ""mdm.dat"" file) from one of my fave uploaders btw :)

2. copied the ""mdm.dat file"" 

3. right clicked on the existing RS

4. went to ""show package contents""--> ""contents""--> ""resources""

5. in ""resources"" I noticed there was another ""mdm.dat"" file there so like the directions macmaverick gave, I replaced that ""mdm.dat"" file with the one I copied from his upload

6. closed everything then turned off my internet connection and joila! it works like a charm :)

THIS IS BASICALLY A STEP BY STEP TUTORIAL FOR ALL MAC USERS WHO WANT THIS PROGRAM . IT IS THE HOMESCHOOL VERSION AND WILL ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS ALL OF THE LESSONS JUST FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS. CHEERS! :)"
,alejandro1212,2012-08-23T23:41Z,"Levels 4 & 5 require program update? 

I downloaded, installed, ran and learned Spanish (Latin America) levels 1-3. Thanks! I'd just installed those three levels -- when I just tried to install level 4 it said the program required an update. I uninstalled & reinstalled program, with crack. Tried installing LA and Spain levels 4 and 5. What/where is the needed update? I don't think my PPC Mac and Tiger will run RS 4x. Thanks!"

,brandonjs,2012-09-04T21:55Z,"I basically have the same problem as L_t0p0...

Previously downloaded, installed and completed a couple lessons of the Spanish version. It was buggy and so I uninstalled it, deleted all of the previous data that I had. I followed the instructions from macmaverickk for his version of the application and am receiving an install error towards the end of the installation. I was NOT connected to the internet when this occurred. 

I'm guessing I missed something. Has anyone run in to similar problems? Anyone able to get past this problem?

I have a 2011 MacBook Pro; Mac OS X 10.7.4"

Not everyone is blessed with MAC know how, so just be polite and give a detailed instruction. If you can't do without an attitude, then don't say anything at all. Keep your bad vibes to yourself.. :) "
