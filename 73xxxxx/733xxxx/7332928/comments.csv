Every weekend, hundreds of street racers unleash their ‘pimped-up’ rides on Kent’s notorious street racing scene, turning the city into a high-octane playground where one false move could result in tragedy. And every weekend, an elite task force from Kent PD has just one mission – to stop the racers in their tracks. Using their own high-performance vehicles to even the playing field, it’s a battle for the streets as Kent PD chases racers down side roads, main thoroughfares, and through warehouse lots trying to keep one step ahead. But with speeds topping 240 kilometers per hour, the stakes couldn’t be higher, and this cat-and-mouse game can turn deadly.
