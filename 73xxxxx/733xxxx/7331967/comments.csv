,Toasterman7,2012-06-06T01:49Z,"Hey Snakeye, loving the uploads! Thank you very much!

Is it possible you have any of the latest updates for any captainsim boeing products (perhaps 727 v2.4 or 757 v4.6? - I got a hold of a uncracked 727pro2.4 installer, if someone could crack it that would be great)"

,Tijauna1,2012-06-08T16:58Z,"Hi, when I try to install this, the setup "
,Tijauna1,2012-06-08T16:59Z,"page with the password will not work. It says password incorrect the moment you press next. When I copy the serial in it still says incorrect.

Sorry my comment got cut in two, accidentally pressed submit. "
,Tijauna1,2012-06-08T17:03Z,I get the message the password you entered is incorrect. 
,_SnakEye,2012-06-08T22:17Z,"Did you Copy & Past the Serial from the TXT file?
it worked for me...
here is the S/N: FSAD-VANCX-B-3296-2914-1417-6826
(just in case you missed it) "
,Tijauna1,2012-06-09T04:36Z,"Yes, I did copy it. But the weird thing is, the moment I press next on the page before the serial page, it also hits next for the serial. Obviously it says incorrect. I copy the serial in and hit next, but it continues to give incorrect. 

I had this problem with older version of Vancouver plus as well, and could never install it. "
,_SnakEye,2012-06-09T13:21Z,"if you have that issue, you could probably overcome it by using ""EnableButton.exe""
if you don't have it, you can get it in my other torrent:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7015657

just run the ""EnableButton.exe"" (leave it open) and then run the setup.
it should pass the ""Next"" screen where you have the S/N asked for without a problem no mater what you fill in the fields.
give it a shot I am almost sure that would solve your strange issue."
