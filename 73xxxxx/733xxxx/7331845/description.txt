This is the official debut album from Deliberate Lies, representing the tail end of 5 years spent in self-imposed exile. Departing somewhat from piano-dominated riffs in earlier works, DLS features thick synth-guitar textures, heavy beats, flowing orchestration, and Rage's signature mixed vocal style.

Guest contributions include Jamie on guitar (Trendy), Caere on backing vocals (Blood Blood Blood), and Jon Hillyard on artwork and logo design.
