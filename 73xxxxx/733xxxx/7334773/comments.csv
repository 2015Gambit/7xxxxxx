Why would anyone convert avi to mp4 unless they had too? 

The only reason why avi is around and still kicking is that some dvd players/tvs/media centers can't handle the processing required of mp4/mkv.

I get it you are in the stone age. You likely have a 10 year old dvd player that can't play mkv or mp4 files. But guess what the rest of the world lives in the 21st century and thats why the scene has moved away from the archaic avi files and towards more modern containers and compression.
