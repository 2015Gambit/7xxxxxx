From the moment they heard him sing, the Beatles dubbed Harry Nilsson their favourite 
American musician. He was one of the most talented singer songwriters of his generation 
the man with the bewitching voice, best remembered for his stunning recording of 
Everyone's Talking, the theme tune to Midnight Cowboy.

But Harry Nilsson was also his own worst enemy, a man whose drink and drugs lifestyle 
was as notorious as his three and a half octave vocal range was legendary. This film 
paints a vivid portrait of the man known to many as The Missing Beatle. With 
contributions from Dustin Hoffman, Yoko Ono, Robin Williams, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, 
Brian Wilson, The Smothers Brothers and many others.
