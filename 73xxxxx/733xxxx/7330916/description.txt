This started as a quick guide to walk you through the basics of optimization. It has grown as I have
continued to share advice, tips and news updates. The main body of the document is the step by step
process ΓÇô but donΓÇÖt forget to read through the end as well. It has all the recent updates and news, as well
as more advice and generally good stuff! So read from start to finish (maybe not all in one sitting). If you
want to do well at your own SEO, the success lies in the details so you need to soak up as much of this
info as you can.
