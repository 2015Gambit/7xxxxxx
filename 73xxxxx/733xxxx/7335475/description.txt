You may get the notification saying Windows is not genuine but it is only temporary until the Sp1 update is installed and the WAT is run. You will be able to use your PC while the message appears in the lower right hand corner of your screen.  The same PC i am typing this on is running the same OS as the torrent here and yes this can work on MAC if your mac supports it. 





MSW 7 Ultimate RTM (Release to Manufacture) is an ISO of a real Microsoft 7 DVD. Its advantage lies in its ability to be used over and over again without errors if you follow the steps below. I have been using this version for years, i have sold it and installed it on over 200 computers and it always works. DO NOT install any anti virus software until the WAT patch is run. It is not a virus so dont give me shit about it if you detect one. Ill only assume you are a techno weenie and ignore any messages regarding viruses in WAT. For the people who know why it may be detected as one ill let you explain it to everyone else.

Directions ΓÇô

Install Windows 7 Ultimate from boot and choose the options you want. During the latter half of the installation it will ask for a serial key, click ΓÇ£NextΓÇ¥ without entering a key and finish the installation. Upon Completion update the OS to Service Pack 1 by manually installing all available updates in the control panel.  Depending on your system the SP1 update may not be available the first day. You may continue to use the computer freely and when the SP1 is installed run the program "remove WAT 226". After the computer reboots you are now free to install any other programs or anti virus software. You will never receive any issues from MS for as long as you use your PC. Following these steps you may use the same DVD as many times as you wish on as many computers as you wish.  ThatΓÇÖs it and enjoy.
