video is pretty poor for a 1.6g rip, its what you would expect to see on a 700mb rip.

audio seemed good.

for a dvd rip.. v - 5 , a - 8"
,Fritz.,2012-06-06T23:09Z,"actually if the screens are any indication, the 700mb rip thats up looks to have clearer video."
,straggler,2012-06-07T19:03Z,For a dvd rip - v:3
,DrunkPollock,2012-06-08T03:11Z,"Like others have said, this is bad quality. Looks like VHS. "

,erich555,2012-06-19T01:48Z,"First it took forever to DL and I have the fastest internet connection available to mankind. Then you find out the quality is sub-par. A/6 V/3 M/don't know yet, still looking for a watchable file. Do not DL."
,spifkitten99,2012-06-20T23:34Z,"Complete shit quality.

Really poorly encoded. For the size of the file, and the length of the movie, it should look a lot better. Even if it had been half the size, it still would not have been up to standards.

Audio is in sync. That's about the only good thing to say about this."
,spifkitten99,2012-06-20T23:34Z,"Seriously, you people who rated the video quality 10, what is wrong with you? You should be forbidden to comment."
,4209er,2012-06-23T01:47Z,Thank you...
