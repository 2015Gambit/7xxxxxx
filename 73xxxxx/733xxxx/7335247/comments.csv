,macomaniac,2012-06-07T11:46Z,"PPC app. Cannot run on Lion 10.7, since the dropping down of the emulation layer 'Rosetta'. Works fine with Snow Leopard 10.6 (or Leopard 10.5 , or Tiger 10.4). If running Lion, one has to use Parallels Desktop (or Vmware Fusion) to virtualize Snow Leopard (Server!) as guest OS, and install AppleWorks on that software. Useful tool to open old .cwk files, anyway."
