,balle14,2012-06-06T02:22Z,"Maynuddin ! Why trying to get our pants on a fucking paysite.......shame...and go somewhere else 
This is the best version to date...we donÂ´t need you or all the other fuckers "
,balle14,2012-06-06T02:34Z,why do you spam with that fucking paysite.......
,Pagan8,2012-06-06T04:59Z,A/V anyone?
,zandbak,2012-06-06T05:59Z,Movie 27 is a SCAM ! YOU HAVE TO PAY !
,guanakito100,2012-06-06T07:02Z,Bad can A/6 V/4 it's dark and colors are off. Just wait for better copy. 
,Calamakuya,2012-06-06T19:03Z,I better wait ti'll there's a better torrent out there.
,michaelrwatson,2012-06-07T02:40Z,"@mariakhan, bibas2147, and others post spam like that because they have small wienees, they never knew their fathers, and their mothers were whores. "
,felesar2,2012-06-07T11:24Z,"normally I swear by s4a's torrents. This time, not so much. Appreciate the effort, but if this is the best around right now, I'm waiting a while for this film.
Cheers s4a, appreciate the effort nonetheless."
,ronangel,2012-06-07T21:13Z,what people do not seem to realise that if it was available in good quality on a paysite it would be uploaded to torrents straight away.so dont waste your money just wait.
,michaelrwatson,2012-06-07T22:28Z,"@ronangel: I think it's only spammers like rjessy and maks06 who *think* people believe that. But you are absolutely right--anything on any paysite if it were actually better would almost immediately (or within an hour or so at the max) be available for free as a torrent. 

But the fact is, those sites have the same mediocre copies, plus a little bonus: some viruses for your computer. "

,leopaul,2012-06-08T15:44Z,Pretty good. Thanks!
,wendelj,2012-06-08T15:55Z,This movie was horrible. Would not bother watching it. It starts out good and goes downhill from there. 
,bawl4,2012-06-08T15:55Z,ironymon-LOL
,raa714,2012-06-08T20:31Z,Scenes cut out that show you this is the prequel to the Alien trilogy. You can tell at last if you had a laser disc player directors cut because it showed you the spaceship which is in the movie but with the other parts missing look for the signs at the end and it will all hit you and yess I thought it was very watchable even since I have seen movie.
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-06-08T23:53Z,"they spam the pay sitess as they are affiliates & get somethin daft like 2 cents per view-as previous post says-if they had the dvd on that crappy site-it would be here,once a dvd copy is available it will be fully viral within 24 hrs....the movie is set on a planet which is dark...like alien was,its not going to be bright lights n glee,its dark for a reason lol."

,bigmike1280,2012-06-10T22:41Z,"i have to agree with dedalus22. stop spamming on piratebay. no one is here cause they want to go pay nine bucks at the theatre. everyone should do what i do, start the download, watch the sample and if it sucks, delete it and move on till you find one that you like. i can't stand seeing people bitch about something that doesn't cost them shit. dumbasses, go watch spongebob or something......gah."
