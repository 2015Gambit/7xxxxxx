,babybluetits24,2012-06-07T15:20Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588334/ imdb score 7.2/10 comedy

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 103 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,wizzard4all,2012-06-07T18:40Z,"@Babybluetits - Who are you? The freaking Seed Police???
Let me introduce you to a marvelous new concept - it's called ""Mind your OWN business""
You should try it. 
If I feel I need a conscience, I'll call Jiminy Cricket......."

,MyKrossini,2012-06-07T19:29Z,"A/V 9/9 Thanks! 
@wizzard4all Who are you the freaking comment police? No one really cares what either of you have to say. Especially someone who says, ""Mind your OWN business"" while he is not minding his OWN business. If you want to rip on people for being polite and thoughtful go to eBaum's World or something. Great movie. Great upload. Thank you TvTeam! "
