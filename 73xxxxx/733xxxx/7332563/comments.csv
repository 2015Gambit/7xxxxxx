,ScarletteSpider,2012-06-06T23:04Z,"actually most of the cast are excellent top drawer actors. If you research other films, plays, etc they've been in you'll see they are all really really good. The problem isnt the acting, the problem is the script and directing which is being dictated to by studio heads and bean counters whom pigeonhole scripting and directing according to what the public watches. if the demographic this show targets, girls 12 to 21 yrs old had more intelligence and didnt watch reality shows and stuff like secret circle and vampire diaries, jane by design wouldnt exist. Viewers dictate what claptrap shoddy crap gets produced. If you want better tv then you boycott the products shown in advertising during the shows and not watch the show. Eventually if everyone sticks to that without waffling then tv studios will stop producing crap tv."
