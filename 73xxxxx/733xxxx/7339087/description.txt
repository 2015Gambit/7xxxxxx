Huw Edwards and Sophie Raworth look back at a spectacular weekend of 
diamond jubilee celebrations.
The festivities began with Sunday's diamond jubilee Thames pageant, when Her Majesty the Queen and members of the royal family took to the River Thames on the royal barge, one of 1,000 boats, to mark sixty years of the Queen's reign.
Monday saw a star-studded diamond jubilee concert, which included show-stopping performances from Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Elton John and JLS.
The final day of celebrations saw a national service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who rounded the afternoon off with a magnificent carriage procession from the Palace of Westminster to Buckingham Palace. Huw, Sophie and guests look back at the highlights of this historic weekend.
