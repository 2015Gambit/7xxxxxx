,brandiburu,2012-06-07T15:23Z,"Honestly speaking, it's a boring scenario. Everything around me was too too quiet; also, very few trains on other tracks.
And only a 20-25 minutes scenario?

Meh..."
,bigtdp,2012-06-07T18:33Z,"thanks - looking forward to the London - Brighton route, and especially the 4CIG add-on too! (I live in Brighton, have been on that line probably 10,000 times!)

,browneggs,2012-06-07T20:31Z,"Scratch my last comment; I guess the tpb_4_ever team have been rumbled, which is a shame. Mr Ahmad is all of a sudden all up for supporting the makers of the DLC's now and states that tpb_4_ever do not partake in piracy."
,mr_ahmad,2012-06-07T21:51Z,"@browneggs:
As we have already stated before that we are not pirating IHH or AP addons since they are small companies which make a living making RW addons..
Its better to support them..
And regarding the message in the torrent, i will jus say, that it is a good practice at least to purchase some addons if u can afford because we dont want Railsimulator.com go down just cuz of piracy.

We are doin this for the people, for the developers and for ourselves cuz we belive that what we have should be shared with all...

Regards,

Team tpb_4_ever"
,browneggs,2012-06-08T00:15Z,"@mr_ahmad Fair do's, I do see your point. I really should dip into my pocket. I agree that it would be a shame if RW were to go belly up."
,lolxd17,2012-06-21T14:01Z,"I have a question and hope that someone can help me. It's really great of you that you upload all this stuff, I must say first ;) But nothing of that, exept the Cologne-Dusseldorf route works for me :( I always get errors after loading scenarios, that models could not be loaded and such. Sometimes there are simply no trains and routes are completely grey, there is not train, no track, no building, nothing. Only a grey flat ground and a error message. Can you tell me how I have to install this stuff? I always extract it with WinRar to my railworks folder and I also see the routes and scenarios in my game, but I cannot play it without error messages. What am I doing wrong and how can I do it right? Thanks for answers ;)"
