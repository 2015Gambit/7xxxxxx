Nick at Nite adds sizzle to summer weeknights with the original primetime drama Hollywood Heights, kicking off with a special preview beginning Monday, June 11. The debut episode will encore every night at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT) through Friday, June 15, with the series premiering on Monday, June 18 at 9:00 P.M. (ET/PT). Adapted for a U.S. audience from the wildly popular Mexican telenovela Alcanzar una Estrella, Hollywood Heights follows the journey of a teenage girl whose life changes drastically when she becomes a star and wins the love of her rock and roll idol, and both are tested by setbacks, heartbreak and deception. The first season of the 80-episode series, co-produced with Televisa in association with Sony Pictures Television, will air weeknights at 9p.m. through October 2012.

“Hollywood Heights"", in the great tradition of telenovelas, serves up relatable characters and compelling storylines that hook you and keep you coming back to see what happens next.” said Marjorie Cohn, Nickelodeon’s President, Development and Original Programming. “The stories are about love, family and following your dreams and summertime offers a great window for this kind of viewing commitment.” (Source: Nickelodeon)
