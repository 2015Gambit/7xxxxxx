,SteXmaN,2012-06-07T14:11Z,finally i changed the aspect ratio to 16:10 :) thx for the up
,T.F.K,2012-06-07T14:25Z,"What this update give to game,what fix?"
[V],scene4all,2012-06-07T14:32Z,"What's New?

Compatibility Issues
* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.

Various Crashes 
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.

Audio Crash
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.

Mouse Sensitivity
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodge™. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting.

Mouse Acceleration
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu).

Stretched Image / Wrong Aspect Ratio
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height  (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu.

Video Memory Reporting as 0MB
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available.  Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards)."

worked perfectly on reloaded's version...."
,Warjo,2012-06-07T14:57Z,"It seems i just cant play this game... First it was crash at first cutscene, tried almost every thing and didn't work, now it just freezes to the loading before that cutscene... i don't even dare to buy this now because i can't be sure if it's the game that fucks up or the cracks.. (i actually think it is in the game rather than the cracks)

i have tried different installs and all, but no.. maybe i'll wait few more updates for the game.."

,lilj8371,2012-06-07T19:20Z,"Too bad it doesn't work. I have tried every ""solution"" listed on dozens of sites. Ever since this update you get one of two things. A freeze on the ""Loading"" screen or the game doesn't launch at all. For all those that say ""I got it working"". Please enlighten the rest of us. Don't just post your brag."

,MTeo567,2012-06-07T21:18Z,grazie thanks.!
,fommod,2012-06-07T21:34Z,"Works great with the RELOADED version of the game. No problems at all.

Thanks to the Uploader and the seeders.

If you are getting the infinite ""Loading..."" symptom then chances are you haven't completely isolated the game from the internet. If you double click the game and you don't even have the chance to select ""Offline"" then 101% you don't completely block the game from the internet. Just disable your network card (wifi or ethernet) from Device manager (it takes 10 seconds and you can enable it again wherever you want) and try it. If now you get the choice to select Offline then you know it's indeed the fact that you don't completely isolate the game from the internet.

And as always, make the 2 max pane exes to always run as Administrator if you run Win7, better safe than sorry.

I have already finished once the RELOADED version without any probs, just installed this update and start it again. No probs at all.

Enjoy the game!"
,FelatioSucks,2012-06-07T22:52Z,"to those saying it's freezing on the loading screen, make sure you have blocked all exe in your firewall. i thought mine automatically blocked all exes but not these for some reason. once i blocked the exes i could play the game. you'll know it is blocked if the small window that opens before the main game allows you to play offline and the window turns red instead of the yellow."
,XHaloXX,2012-06-07T23:10Z,"thx, works gr8. but sth weird about this crack, this file gsrld.dll is 158 K and NIS detected it as a virus, i know whats false positive is, BUT the first  crack and patch 1.0.0.17 crack from RLD has this file for 155 K and NIS didnt complain about it, so why now?? 

as far as i can tell, only the exe is needed when a patch is released, some rare times, you need to copy other files.

I just copied the file from an older crack from RLD and the game worked like a charm. so in my opinion this file is nuked, my advise is to get this file from patch 1.0.0.17 crack and not use this one."
,easy101,2012-06-07T23:11Z,"I followed all the steps exact. However, the social club wont log me in ""invalid username or password"" and at  the title screen it just says ""initializing..."" or ""loading..."" anyone have a similar problem or know how to fix?"
,Shadow416,2012-06-07T23:14Z,"whaaat a load of horse shit, Rockstar made a patch to fix the audio only for the screen to freeze and the audio continue lol.

How i installed...just install the update, keep internet on, run game sign in (keep it on auto sign in) once you're signed in, exit the game. instead of just blocking connection i disable internet through adapter settings its simpler to me...anyways...once you do that or block connection to the exe, just run the game again and have fun...

my issue now is my screen freezes...before the game would play just fine before the update aside from the occasional audio cut outs...now the screen freezes which is worse i can't even play lol...gah...nice update Rockstar pff "
,lightsR,2012-06-07T23:23Z,"Thank you for this update, which now allowed me to play the game, before this update i had shitload of crashes and errors, but now it works"
,XHaloXX,2012-06-07T23:50Z,"@easy101 , you need to copy the profiles from the crack folder to your DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club.

,Warjo,2012-06-07T23:50Z,"HEY! i said it's not working, ffs. i got it to work with this crack :) the reloaded mp3 + this update, and no other shit and baaam, it started working.

thanks scene and thanks reloaded, nice game too :D might have to buy it too :D"
,Warjo,2012-06-07T23:52Z,"Oh and one hint, blocking mp3 exes from internet isn't enough, you need to block social club too, i just cut my net for the time i play, i don't need internet on my game machine. I use laptop for that :D"
,Shadow416,2012-06-08T00:50Z,"@Halo 
your post towards me was completely uneducated, like it was legitimately stupid....I got the update from here...I gave the steps for installing the update...I informed these folks how the update didn't completely work due to the fact it froze shit up...so I don't know how you do things...but I'd like to let the other downloaders know what to expect before they download, so maybe they'd rather avoid a screen freeze and keep an occasional audio cut out...you fucking moron. Seriously next time, think before you talk."
,An0nym0usPirate,2012-06-08T02:09Z,"@Warjo , I'm having the same exact problems.  It took me a while to finally get past the social club issue, but when I did the game always freezes/crashes right after the cutscene starts after I select my difficulty.  Every single time it will crash at that same point and I've tried everything to make it work, but I think there's something wrong with the game or my hardware just doesn't want to work with it."

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Update+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. After install choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe and MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3 replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update and follow the above instruction from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3 replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your setting and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and enabled your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu...""  and hearing that someones has still problem I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)"

just literally do as the instructions said on the info and you're good. you'll need your internet active when you run the game for the first time AFTER the update so you can login (set log-in as auto sign in) then once that works and you reach main menu exit, then stop internet access for the game or just disable internet via network adapter and run the game n have fun.

Like I said, I could play the game until this update. When im offline it says this exactly ""Please go online to activate your product"" HELP!!!"
,danwat1234,2012-06-15T03:23Z,"What pirateGRC says to do: The game will work if you follow these steps::

You have to apply the first REALOADED Updates, Crack, dlc and profiles that can be found seperately here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED (works with this Retail Version as well).

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the instructions from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)

!/ symbol is not correct!The correct one can't be showed here so you understand it's the opposite of that / slash meaning the backslash of course!

Special thanks to the Uploaders!"
,danwat1234,2012-06-15T03:24Z,"First download this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7313983/MAX_PAYNE_3_-_RETAIL_DVD_-_MULTI_10_-_PC

Then follow that guide"
,Nickypoos,2012-06-16T11:54Z,"The instructions in this (update.v 1.0.0.22) says not to install it until v 1.0.0.17 has been installed yet I can't find that here on PB to download so what do we do please?

So far if I run playmaxpayne3.exe I get the screen saying it needs to update files before it can be played and if maxpayne3.exe I get the never loading load screen. So near yet so far. Argh!! lol

Never mind, hang on in there. Hopefully doing the two updates will help. Fingers crossed. :)"
,Nickypoos,2012-06-16T18:30Z,It's ok - panic over. I'd actually got this DL with 1.0.0.17 in it but somehow it had got renamed to Max.Payne.3.UPDATES.ONLY-RELOADED. No idea why. It was confusing me but I've sussed it out now so no worries. Wish people wouldn't do that but never mind. Confused uTorrent but thankfully not me for long. :)
,Argris_D,2012-06-16T20:29Z,"For those having ""BLANK SCREEN"" or ""SAFE MODE ONLY"" problems.


It worked for me. Hope it helps... Start the game in ""safe mode"". It will start in a 800x640 window. Go to settings/graphics and then set directx to ""9"". Accept. It will ask to restart the game. Accept again. When the game restarts (in safe mode again) quit and then start NORMALLY. Now it is supposed to run normally. It did on me. You can change any setting AND put it in fullscreen but don't change the directx."
,Nickypoos,2012-06-17T14:34Z,"I would like to personally thank danwat1234 and PirateGRC for all their help/advice here and in/with other torrents required for this. After a failed install, I uninstalled it and re-did it, following these instructions to the letter. Installing the game first then update v.1.0.0.17 and finally this one. It now works perfectly and in high settings virtually throughout without a stutter. I'm currently up to level 3 but considering I only started playing a few hours ago, not bad. :)

For those of you still having problems (you won't if you follow the advice given) then check out your specs to make sure it will run with your setup.

For those interested, I'm running Win7 Ultimate 64 bit with SP1. AMD Athlon 7750DC 2.70 GHz and nVidia GeForce 9600GT graphic card and 4Gb of RAM. As I say, running like a dream so far and whilst I think my setup is reasonably good, it's not even high end spec by a long way. Anyway hope it works with yours. Good luck and now go get 'em cowboys! :)"
,qgghbfdvf,2012-06-22T16:02Z,"Hi !
I'm trying to install the game for one week, I'll kill myself ! 
I follow the instruction, install/uninstall, three times, but the same problem still.
When I try to play, I can see the profile (stats, etc...), but when I press ""Enter"" to play, it says I need to be connected on the internet to run the game !
What can I do please ?!?!

PS : excuse my english, I'm french..."
,ChromeZX,2012-06-23T18:52Z,"Hey guys, for those of you that don't want to have to shut off your internet each time you want to play, you can simply firewall the executables like danwat1234 has stated.

1.) On Windows 7, open control panel>system and security>Windows Firewall>Advanced Settings

2.) Under inbound rules, click new rule, navigate to maxpayne3.exe and block it.

3.) Do the same for playmaxpayne3.exe and renderer.exe under the social club directory.

4.) Under outbound rules, do the same thing for the same executables

5.) The game will automatically login to 2012RLD each time you star the game with your internet still connected (assuming you followed danwat1234's guide and logged in once with the internet off)"
,MushyMouth,2012-06-25T22:39Z,"Guys MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe is infected with Sirefef/P. This is a bitch of a rootkit to remove.

If you've installed it. Combofix multiple times, Safe mode, Kaspersky AV Boot disk, MSE can catch it but wont remove it, Malwarebytes a couple times as well."

,sklev89,2012-06-28T05:50Z,"i figure the outbound connections have to be done again.


TURN OFF INTERNET AND IT WORKS!

Alternatively you can block the new crack files from outgoing connections. Cant be fukt personally."
,memooo,2012-06-28T16:53Z,"AFTER INSTALLING, UPDATE AND CRACK
USE YOUR FIREWALL TO BLOCK
1- MaxPayne3.exe (IN MAX PAYNE 3 FOLDER)
2- PlayMaxPayne3.exe (IN MAX PAYNE 3 GAME FOLDER)
3- renderer.exe  (IN ""C:Program FilesRockstar GamesSocial Club"" FOLDER)

OR

DISCONNECT YOUR INTERNET"

,rapidfirereaper,2012-07-27T09:38Z,Very confused about this update. Reloaded uploads are almost always clean. Not this time and this is no false positive. One of the DDL files is a maleware generator. Installed this update and avast goes nuts. I run a bootime scan and windows/system32/assembly/GAC64/desktop.ini. THIS IS NOT A NOOB COMMENT. Only way I could fix it is system restore to before I installed. Please BEWARE everyone! Only us updates .13 and .17!!!!
