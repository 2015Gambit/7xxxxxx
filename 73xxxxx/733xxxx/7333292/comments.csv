[V],sidcookie,2012-06-07T17:16Z,"thank you for kindly pointing that out.. but album release dates are dependent on the source of ur content..

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todo_A_Su_Tiempo_(Marc_Anthony_album)

the article ""Release History"" in the above mentioned wiki link clearly states that 1995 was not a worldwide release... 

the album was released in different countries over a number of years.. the same applies for every artist and every album"
[T],rjordan21,2012-06-07T19:46Z,"^^^ Yep, but the point is the music was first released in 1995.  The album was ""re-released"" in later years. It might even be ""remastered"" in 2012 but would you want to specify that in a discography of his work?  1995 was the year the original production was complete.  I would imagine that someone looking at an entire body of work would want to know when the artist completed a particular album....."
[V],sidcookie,2012-06-07T20:31Z,"my source cd is 1996.. hence i've listed 1996 and i've given a wiki link which proves my point..

if u dont lik my stuff dont download it.. if u feel im making wrong reports on my torrents.. then report it to the crew"
[T],rjordan21,2012-06-08T12:59Z,"I don't doubt for a second that your source cd was released a year later..... there won't be any ""reporting to the crew"".... :))"
