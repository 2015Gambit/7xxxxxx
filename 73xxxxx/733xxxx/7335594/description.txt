Description:
Tomb Raider is a game that needs no introduction but if, for some reason, you are not familiar with the series, then these games are about the adventures of the beautiful, intelligent, and athletic British archaeologist Lara Croft. You might think that this job is mostly digging holes and dusting old bones. How could a game about that possibly be fun? Well, Lara Croft is anything but an ordinary archaeologist and her life is anything but boring. Lara Croft, tomb raider, occupies an interesting niche between Indiana Jones and Bayonetta: sheΓÇÖs a relic hunter who can kick butt and take names with the best of them. When Lara ventures into ancient tombs in search for legendary treasures and forgotten knowledge, she must keep in mind that those responsible for safeguarding those artifacts didnΓÇÖt leave them unguarded. The tombs are filled with deadly traps, bizarre monsters, and clever puzzles. Lara is not all looks, though, so sheΓÇÖs ready for the dangers that await. At her disposal is an arsenal of weapons from twin pistols, through all kinds of machine guns and assault rifles, all the way to grenade launchers and bazookas.
