Experience your photo memories and enjoy

The Scalado Album is designed for making your everyday photo experience great. We want to bring you the best user experience possible but still keep the design simplistic and responsive. It is built from ground up using the Scalado Imaging Platform to enable maximum performance on Android. The album allows you to quickly find the photos you are looking for and you can smoothly zoom into every single detail in full resolution.
We value your feedback a lot and we are improving the application all the time, but please report bugs and feature requests to our email below and not in the user review. To fix the bugs we may need to contact you.
