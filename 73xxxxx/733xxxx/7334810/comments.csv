[V],mdprosser,2012-06-07T06:40Z,"definitely the best copy available right now & a great TS in general, so cheers to that!... 

v/8
a/9

only a few minor problems... 

the action scenes can be pretty choppy, and there's a flicker on just a few very bright scenes

the audio is great, just out of sync throughout the film... 

otherwise a great copy!  Thanks for all the hard work!!!"
