Anomalous - Cognitive Dissonance - 2006

Anomalous is a progressive-technical-death-metal band formed in 2001 by Tim Hale and Max Seeman. With a goal of creating a sound that melded their disparate influences, the founding members began writing music. Despite the lack of a vocalist, bassist and a revolving cast of drummers, a series of shows in the San Francisco Bay Area announced Anomalous as a presence. In 2005, the founding members were joined by Nate Vennarucci, and the trio began recording, substituting programmed drums and samples for the ever-revolving cast of percussionists. Upon completion of the recording, the Minnesota-based metal label Brutal Bands picked up the band and in 2006 ΓÇ£Cognitive DissonanceΓÇ¥ was released to favorable reviews
