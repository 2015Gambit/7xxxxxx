They are wanting to replace it with another avengers show that is more like Ultimate Spider-Man and in that universe (can we say Super Hero Squad 2?). This is not a joke.  My family (Me, Girfriend, and 2yr old daughter, she call it ""Hulk"") love this show and the story arcs are amazing.  Its the best Marvel cartoon sense the early 90s Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons.  So, please, please, help to stop this from happening.

THEY ARE GOING TO CANCEL THIS SHOW SO PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION!

since when any petition have helped to get any shows back in production ?
and tbh you need to be in that country they show it and watch it in tv so you can be in the ratings what matter the most

all these companies dont give a sh!t about what fans like ... for them they need raitings and they get raitings out of 10% of the full fan base what is all over the world"

,J-RedtheRed,2012-06-09T00:16Z,its worth a shot at least right?
,J-RedtheRed,2012-06-09T00:19Z,also if they want ratings then they need to air it saturday mornings instead of sunday when alot of people are at church.
,mt101pun,2012-06-10T16:07Z,Petition signed. If it changes nothing hopefully they will realize that they are alienating the older audience that made Marvel successful in the first place.
