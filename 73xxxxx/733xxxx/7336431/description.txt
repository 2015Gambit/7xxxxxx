jQuery is a cross-browser javascript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. Used by over 55% of the 10,000 most visited websites, 
jQuery is the most popular javascript library in use today. jQuery is free, open source software, dual-licensed under the MIT License or the GNU General Public License, Version 2. 
jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. 
jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the javascript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. 
The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.
