This activation procedure worked for me so if you are having trouble then give it a try.

Encore works fine and Premiere has all its presets.

I even have Adobe set up for auto updates and it has downloaded and installed them with no trouble at all.

All I can say is that you must follow the instructions exactly as I have written them, that is what worked for me.

I cannot guarantee it will work for you but I had tried several methods before I tried this, all with no success.

I did upload this before but for some reason it was removed by pirate bay and I have no idea why.
