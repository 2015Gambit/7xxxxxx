,whyess,2012-06-15T14:51Z,"I did exactly as your instructions indicate (i added the hosts to the adobe hosts file i installed, applied crack etc. i ran an update but when i now try to run encore i get an error message saying 

""adobe encore cs6 cannot run in non-royalty  serialized mode the application needs to be serialized with a royalty bearing serial number""

could it be that the update rewrote activation files or something 

also adobe premiere works fine however when i try to open a tutorial project from cs5.5 i get an error message saying 

""this project contained a sequence that could not be opened no sequence preview preset file or codec could be associated with this sequence type""

please help me anyone"
