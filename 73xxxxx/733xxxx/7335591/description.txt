This is an article on the Wilson Tool and Cutter grinder. The Wilson is an interesting design, it closely resembles the small commercial T&CG machines you can buy, however it is a home made version.

Its weighs 50 pounds, occupies just over 1 sq foot of bench space and has a 1/20hp motor. Includes an air spindle which operates on 15 PSI.

WARNING - this is just an article about the grinder written by the author, if anyone is interested in the plans for this grinder, please comment on this page and I will try to upload them by Dec. 2012 (apologies in advance for the delay)
