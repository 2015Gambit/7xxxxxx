However, the video lags at several places.
Watch at 12:00 when Gibbons walks from the right to the left of the stage. Just passing the speaker sets, it looks like missing frames.

I've seen this using VLC at my PC and at my TV using the WDTV box."

This is seen in scattered places in the video.

,Palle-Pirat,2012-09-10T18:04Z,"Hi, great upload but the video lags.

Watch at 12:00 when Gibbons walks from the right to the left of the stage. Just passing the speaker sets, seems like every second frame is missing.
This happens in scattered areas all over the video.

Great quality and sound however.
