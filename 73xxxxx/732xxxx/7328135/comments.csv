,darthjon,2012-06-05T12:41Z,Are the subtitles hardcoded?
,vielen,2012-06-05T18:07Z,I don't think the subs are hardcoded because there are srt files for every episode in the torrent.
,Armada500,2012-06-05T20:37Z,"No, only Dothraki language is hardcoded in the video, the rest is external subbed with a .srt file.
No subtitle files are in the MKV containers"
