,lady696,2012-06-05T02:56Z,"This is a Flash file Movie, its ending in .mkv , its NOT a quicktime H.264 file format....and  i doesn't play at all anywhere. it would be nice if you all upgrade to what really can be played anywhere such as quicktime  .mov files (thats an actual H.264 file !) or an old fashioned .avi file, or if you are not living in stonage anymore even an mp4 or m4v, which is the best most platform-independant and no loss enlarging file format, and hey, for all mac users, it can be dropped into iTunes to watch through an apple TV as well..."
,TR4V,2012-06-05T06:10Z,lady696: Sorry to burst your bubble on that pathetic rant.. but its not a flash file.. Its a container file.. Do some research before you pretend to know everything.. thanks
