Hey guys
Well...Briging you now another new movie as BrDrip from original "Miami Vice" BD movie European version
Unfortunately this movie comes in VC1/1080p video codec so it is more difficult
to get a perfect IQ/VQ.
For avoid to give you a too big movie's size,i reconverted it to 720p (1280 x 720) as final screen resolution.
You won't get a perfect VQ and IQ anyway by there's sometimes a few noise and few pixelation that are present in certain specific scenes (Nightly scenes and others...)
But don't worry as it will stay really acceptable and still very watchable anyway.
