Home [2012]
Genre: Indie Horror

Home is a unique horror adventure set in a beautifully-realized pixel world. ItΓÇÖs a murder mystery with a twistΓÇöbecause you decide what ultimately happens. 

"Awakened by an oncoming storm, you open your eyes to discover yourself in a strange, dark roomΓÇötucked away in a house thatΓÇÖs not yours.
 
As you play the game, it changesΓÇösubtly, almost imperceptiblyΓÇöto reflect your perspective. It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its truths are entirely subjective."

I haven't seen any uploads of this anywhere, so I spent the $2 to share this game with you all.

Simply run the installer, and enjoy!
