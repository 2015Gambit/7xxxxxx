Grand Magus-The Hunt-2012-GRAVEWISH

In the form of The Hunt , Swedish riff gods GRAND MAGUS report back impressively! 
With their sixth studio album and likewise Nuclear Blast debut, the metal purists 
manage to better their highly celebrated 2010 masterpiece Hammer Of The North
easily. The trio from Stockholm has always consequently sticked to its own path of 
evolution without ever leaving behind the gathered experiences they've never casted 
off their early days pumping groove nor their love for epic doom or extreme metal. 

Now the Scandinavians go the extra mile with The Hunt. In May, the motto will be: 
Break cover, go in and win the wolves are back!
