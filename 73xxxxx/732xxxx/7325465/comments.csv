I allso think of the emmigrants in my country, that join social wellfare or avoid tax and then bring thousands of money back on visit's to their ""home"" country (payin for arranged marriage, 2nd. family household etc. etc.)"

I'm the sleepless ghostwalker.

Half man - half bookvampire, forever wandering in hunger for new books to own and consume.

As You know, tha earth is round (still flat in some countries - but nevermid). Unfortunately the sun can't shine all over due to it's nature.

The reason is (of course) that Your clock/time is 12 hour based, and mine is 24 hour based.

Soo - i sleep once within this 24 hour, while You sleep within a 12 hour clock - giving You twice a much sleeping periods !!!

That is the explanation ! - did'nt You learn that i school :))"

I think your clock is a 48 hour clock"
