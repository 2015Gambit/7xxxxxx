,jaaosuna,2012-06-19T14:01Z,"Hey, thank you so much for the AVI. Now can you help me with something? How did you convert the mp4 to a perfect AVI? And under what settings do you make the conversion? I've been dying to know what software or tools to use to make it as perfect as you did, cause a lot of files are in mp4 and can't be seen on for example a ps3 or dvd player. I will appreciate the help. Thanks!"
