This is a recording of B.B. KingΓÇÖs live performance at the Royal Albert Hall on June 28th, 2011. The 85-year old legend gave a thrilling performance and in return, he was given a standing ovation from all of the participants. Joining the illustrious Mr. King onstage were guitar virtuoso Derek Trucks, ΓÇ£songbird extraordinaireΓÇ¥ Susan Tedeschi, The Rolling StonesΓÇÖ Ronnie Wood, Simply RedΓÇÖs Mick Hucknall and former Guns NΓÇÖ Roses axeman Slash. Along with the tone of the songs and performance, the guests are also enjoying the life and on this particular night, the ride that has brought them to this spot. TedeschiΓÇÖs vocals sound fantastic on ΓÇÿRock Me Baby,ΓÇÖ and KingΓÇÖs on-stage flirtation with her crooning mannerisms is charming and engaging. Slash and Wood help provide their own individual contributions along with Hucknall that make for a memorable night. All in all, for his first performance in the vaunted performance venue, B.B. King Live at the Royal Albert Hall is another gem in the crown of what may possibly be AmericaΓÇÖs greatest living musician.
