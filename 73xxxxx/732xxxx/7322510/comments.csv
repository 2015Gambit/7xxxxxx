,joanmcbitch,2012-06-10T01:24Z,Google it. There's an article.
,DarkTrololo,2012-06-14T05:22Z,This isn't a authentic Nerf Gun or? I mean this can't be the original production plans...
,joanmcbitch,2012-06-28T11:51Z,Definitely not original judging by the two safety notes.
,Asshole_Nord,2012-07-04T13:02Z,@Steezy5 These are prints / models for 3D printers. This one in particular gives you the ability to print a Nerf gun.

,roadjag,2012-09-12T21:05Z,"Wow the price of a 3D Printer is really worth it to create a ""Nerf Gun"". Go spend ten bucks and buy one. I like the idea of physibles but highly doubt this will catch unless 3D printing becomes affordable."
,Plan9x128,2012-09-15T15:49Z,Physibles are yet to be deployed in large.
