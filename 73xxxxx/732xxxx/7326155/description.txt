After the success of his debut EP "First Contact", Astrobear spent the next year working on his first full length album. Polar Eclipse is a balance of extreme ends of the sonic spectrum. Mesmerizing deep-space melodies transform into twisted evolving soundscapes. Ice cold down-tempo rhythms build into driving pounding beats. Deep dark sub bass rolls beneath organic instruments and synthesizers. Astrobear matures as an artist and a producer and takes it to the next level with this album.
