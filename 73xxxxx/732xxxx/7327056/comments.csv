u can just add entry in boot menu of windows 7 with the help of easy bcd

it will create new boot entry  u can name it anything like emergency boot /win 7 pe

whenever ur main os fails to load  u can boot from that entry

  i do have portable (firefox , mini partition wizard ,norton ghost) on my data drive apart from my 2-3 windows installation drive.

i can use them to partition hdd, restore ghost image ,do ghost backup, "

This would be great for if you need to move something like the ""Users"" folder due to low disk space, and then create a symbolic link pointing to the original location so that the OS doesn't freak out when you boot back into it."
