Despite exposure to deadly radiation, the Federation colony on Omicron Ceti III appears to be thriving. A landing party from the Enterprise investigates, finding the colony's population to be healthy beyond explanation. Leila Kalomi, an old friend of Mr. Spock, shows the landing party strange flowers that seem to impose a state of pure bliss on all exposed to its spores (even Spock). The spores' effects spread rapidly throughout the Enterprise, causing the crew to mutiny against Captain Kirk.
