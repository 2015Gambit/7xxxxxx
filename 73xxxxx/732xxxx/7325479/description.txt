thx

Encode:

the russian video was really great for a ts, almost dvd, just the angle thing needs to be fixed.
2 times a guy stands up in the cinema and walks throught the lense, that cant be fixed

made the video slightly brighter fixed contrast and added sharpness
angle would need a lot rotation to get it straight but that looses so much video, tried that didnt look ok
from 720x352 you would get 720x304, tried to find a middle way
made 720x336, which still looks good but the heads dont get cut off that much, so only slightly loss and looks good that way.
source ts had 25 frames, the versions out have 23, dont see that point, so muxed audio to the source framerate, found a 3 sec spot
that seems to got cut out, had no audio for the spot inserted some else that fitted.
made a syncthrough on 8 spots nothing major all in 150ms range, looks and sounds good now and will do till r5
enjoy.
