,MeLikeATorrent,2012-06-03T14:33Z,"As a part of this History, past and present, I'd like to thank you for putting this torrent together.. I'm gonna share it with my family, because our line owned all of the local shops at the time. Especially during the days of Sid Hatfield and Matewan, which is not as prevalent to this specific act. However thanks again, the video is great ... Quality is A+ Sound A+"

,willytakum,2012-06-07T14:45Z,"Tried to download a copy from TVTeam...they are spamming TPB, advertising a ""new"" torrent site that is ""by PAID MEMBERSHIP ONLY""...Seriously...wtf? incomplete torrents and adware...Stay away from TVTeam...FaMoUz is the only trusted uploader with TV,and mimi-series torrents...Fuck TVTeam  SPAMMERS"
,willytakum,2012-06-07T14:51Z,"TVTeam is spamming TPB advertising a ""new"" torrent site. When you follow the link, however, you will find a page that demands money to join their ""exclusive"" club...really? I thought the idea was SHARING...WE SHARE WITH EACH OTHER...WE DONT SELL TORRENTS TO EACH OTHER...THE TORRENT SITES USE ADVERTISING TO MAKE MONEY...So fuck-off TVTeam...stick your torrents up your ass all the way to the red part...you suck...GO FaMoUz   we love you..."

[V],FaMoUz,2012-06-08T05:21Z,@willytakum im not hiding ur comments n THANK U :D
,willytakum,2012-06-08T06:27Z,"@stevogaleb...you are a moron...complaining about a so-called trusted uploader that's actually trying to compete with TPB by covertly using text mssgs hidden in the torrent and on top of that they are charging ""donations"" for membership unless invited...the only way to be invited is if a friend PAYS the ""donation"" fee and then he can ""give"" a free membership away to one friend...We should all be bitching about that...but hey I got a dollar that says YOU didn't call your Senator or congressman lately concerning the future of this country either...and that same dollar says your an habitual nsrcicistic leech...your average share ratio is probably something less than 1 or 2%......cause you're a 1%er   probably so self-absorbed you can't see past your face"
,willytakum,2012-06-08T06:29Z,no hard feelings FaMoUz...you're the greatest...and I know they probably didn't fuck-up the H&M series on purpose...they just fucked it up...
,minapengar,2012-06-22T10:03Z,any1 know why the aren't any subtitles at all for this at subtitleseeker?
,oneleggoalie,2012-07-06T14:10Z,"Go to Subscene for all your subs, TV, movies, and hell knows what else....subscene.com"
,freestyle_mccnasty,2012-07-16T15:42Z,"@willytakum... Wow this dude is a fuckin bitch!! Shut the fuck up!! You dont share torrents with anyone, you have no up-loads. Dont pay for a fuckin membership if you dont want but the whole point of having a membership to a private torrent site is to avoid fake torrents and virus. "
