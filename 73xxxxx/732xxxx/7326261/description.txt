Γêå (pronounced Alt-j) was formed when Gwil Sainsbury [ guitarist/bassist] , Joe Newman [guitar/vocals], Gus Unger-Hamilton and Thom Green met at Leeds, UK University in 2007. 

Gus studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Joe showed Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband. 

Gus completed the bandΓÇÖs lineup and together ΓÇô first as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as FILMSΓÇô the four friends spent the next two years playing around town, developing a precise and unique brand of alt. pop that draws on poignant folk verses, crushing synths, smart hip hop syncopations and tight vocal harmonies. A small set was quickly developed using these and newly-written songs, and the band began to build a modest reputation through some crammed gigs in their front room.
