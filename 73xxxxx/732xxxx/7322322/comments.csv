,Meat69,2012-06-16T16:45Z,why does it just play the audio in  windows media player and no video?
,snowjayne,2012-06-17T06:11Z,"dont bother downloading this torrent, it has a cinavia message 1 error. bummer"
,macstar2012,2012-06-18T05:50Z,"The reason for sound and no screen or vise a verse is that you need a special codec to run the film, i would suggest klite codec pack. This will usually cure the issue and run any mix of video and audio together..Also try using vlc media player excellent player klite will install codec for that as well..gl:)"
