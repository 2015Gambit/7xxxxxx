They can't. They won't. They seed just what is good and not my piece of crap. It is too small to be good. Games of Thrones season pack MUST be TEN Gb at least. Search and look how many seeders they have."
,jdemalt,2012-06-04T23:37Z,i feels ya man. this resolution is great for my laptop and less space-consuming

,ZetaBeta,2012-06-07T03:20Z,"First I just want to say thanks for all the work you put into your torrents. And the quality is great considering that it's less than 2gb for a season. 

I also wanted to know if you will be putting up the first season? I looked and found one torrent that claimed you had converted it but was uploaded by someone else. I'm not sure I trust them as they were leaving annoying links on other peoples torrents. 

Anyway I didn't find one on your account and a link to one by you would be great if I missed it. If you haven't put on up I'd like you to consider converting season 1 the same way. 

thanks again

[V],twentyforty,2012-06-07T18:21Z,"@ZetaBeta: On SU only. As HDTV season pack uploaded on 2nd of October 2011 (1.7 GB) and later, as episode torrents, BluRay.576p. (all together 3 GB). I  seed there fast and non-stop."
,ZetaBeta,2012-06-08T02:42Z,"Thanks for the info but I can't get on SU. Iv'e been trying for the last few weeks since you said you would only be there. Unfortunatly they are full.
Is TI a good place to request a invite? Thanks for the quick reply about season 1.  "

,michaelrwatson,2012-06-25T05:15Z,"Hey ""twentyforty"" 480p is okay but no one wants 720p. 

The ONLY reason anyone is downloading your 720p rips is because they couldn't find anbother one to download (or else they're just stupid)."
,hakuna_matata,2012-07-01T20:54Z,"THANKS...

FULL SEASON IN 480p .. THIS NEED TO BE IN TOP100.
"
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-18T17:41Z,"@michaelrwatson: You realize how now one mentioned 720p but you. 
And you are wrong. You have no reason, whatsoever, to rise your personal opinion as - general one. You don't KNOW what other people think - you in fact only assume (for very very wrong reasons) - have a personal opinion - and opinions  are like asses, anyone has one, right?

My 720p is NOT an alternative to Scene 720p. It can't be. My 720p is not alternative at all. 720p is just a format tag, nothing more. Or is it?

My 720p can be one step up for people who have either MP4 capable hardware players or/and have bigger playback displays (above 23"") what makes any standard XviD unwatchable or degrade watching pleasure too much.

What you've failed to realize (or put into consideration) is the fact how my 720p are small as 450 MB and anytime my 720p can use XviD to wipe ass - even 2 CD XviD rips are not good as any 720p of mine, especially if people are not delusional.

480p is not a silver bullet. Sometimes (not too often) 480p in size could approach near 720p one, it is rooted in specific demands of specific encoding technique you know nothing about. You can't. I haven't taught you to encode.

Anyhow, learn not to speak from the ass and always try to verify your words with either some proof or evidence, or you will sound as one who have no idea what he speak  about, but keeps telling..."

now one = no one

Sorry."
