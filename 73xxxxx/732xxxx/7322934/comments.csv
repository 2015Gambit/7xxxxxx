1. In your utorrent/bittorent client, click this particular NBA torrent.
2. Then go to ""Files"" tab and wait until 2 files comes up (if you downloaded this torrent via magnet)
3. If you want to download 540p version only, right click on 360p version folder and select ""Don't download"" (then vice versa if you want to download the 360p version only).
4. Voila!!! Done

Cheerss.... "
