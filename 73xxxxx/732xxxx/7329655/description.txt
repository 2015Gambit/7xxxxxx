Eureka.S05E07.HDTV.xvid-][ Ex-Machina ][ 05-Jun-2012 ] avi

converted ASAPs mp4 to xvid.. 25fps 640x352 mp3 audios
all seems in sync... at least asaps mp4 are way better then LOLs effort

Ex-Machina - Fargo is convinced that Holly is still inside the Matrix computer, but the DOD is determined to wipe the hard drive clean-losing Dr. Marten forever.

help to seed if grabbing !

Make sure you use peer block with level 1 ips and vpns or other ip changing methods!.. as seems nbc/syfy is sending letters
to peoples isps again even though xvids are lower quality then HD
rips how sad they worry about less then 1000 download a show
cost more in lawyers sending the letters then if the 1000 bought
it direct online.. crazy people!

enjoy
