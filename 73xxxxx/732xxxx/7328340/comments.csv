,mikedongs,2012-08-25T09:09Z,"Dude, you have some good uploads but for fuck's sake please quit including these AWFUL songs in the executable. This stuff is very, very bad. At least this one isn't as headache-incuding as the ""song"" in your mIRC 7.22 download.

Not having ugly background graphics that make serials hard to read wouldn't hurt either."
