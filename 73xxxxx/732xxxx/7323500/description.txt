ΓÇÿLively and thought provokingΓÇªat a key time in the development of primary mathematics teaching and learning. It offers a very much richer model of mathematics learning than is available to many young learners and has the potential to have a real impact on the way mathematics is taught.ΓÇÖ - Jan Winter, Bristol University, UK

What is good mathematics teaching? What is mathematics teaching good for? Who is mathematics teaching for?

Under-pinned by findings from the largest research programme into primary mathematics funded in recent years, Transforming Primary Mathematics offers a clear, practical approach to implementing fundamental change in curriculum, classroom environment and teaching styles. It offers an inspiring, sometimes controversial, and often unconventional look at the subject of mathematics, by:

    Endorsing the use of a ΓÇÿnew mathematicsΓÇÖ ΓÇô one based on problem solving, modelling and inquiry, not on abstract rules, memorising, and regurgitation

    Arguing that there is more to maths teaching than ΓÇÿdeath by a thousand worksheetsΓÇÖ

    Challenging norms, such as the practice of sorting children into sets based on their perceived mathematical ability

    Advocating an environment where teachers are encouraged to take risks

    Looking at how best to prepare learners for an unknown future

    Encouraging reflection on teachersΓÇÖ own beliefs and values about mathematics.

Transforming Primary Mathematics is for all primary school teachers who want to make mathematics welcoming, engaging, inclusive and successful.
