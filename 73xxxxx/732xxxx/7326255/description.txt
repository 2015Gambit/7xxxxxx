I ran into a young girl who had LET IT BE tattooed on her forearm, loves the Beatles but didnt own a single album.  Just individual songs downloaded from Itunes... God, Lennon is rolling over in his grave.  This is why Neil Aspinhall quit Apple Records!  I took the time to convert the 2009 remastered Box Set using dBpoweramp to MP3 using the VBR setting -V2.5 estimated bit rate 180kps encoding slow (high quality). Obviously my FLAC files sound much better but the music here peaks at 256-320kps.  Everything fits nicely on one CDR to share with the uninitiated younger generations... or to play in your car set on shuffle.
