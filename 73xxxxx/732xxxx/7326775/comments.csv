,grr7446,2012-06-04T04:39Z,"Always a bad fake spoiler attempt, lol."
,grr7446,2012-06-04T04:45Z,"Azza's ""spoiler"" is 100% false. Some Lannisters might (or might not..) eventually die, but probably not this episode. ;)"

,Sunn0)),2012-06-04T05:09Z,Will seed if it ever finishes.
,parEsti,2012-06-04T05:13Z,Of course Robb will die. It is written.
,TMC1106,2012-06-04T05:13Z,If people read the books they would know how the show is.  People are always going to post fake spoilers

,pamolama,2012-06-04T05:31Z,"azza you oaf, don't post spoilers.  not all of us have watched it yet"
,rjcripe,2012-06-04T05:33Z,"Haha I love how EVERY SINGLE WEEK the first couple comments on the Game of Thrones upload is always an oh-so-incredibly-obviously fake spoiler and how EVERY SINGLE WEEK someone always, without fail, get's in a huff and all butthurt.

As someone who's read the books and has a pretty solid idea of what will happen each episode, let me assure you--not a single spoiler I've read on these torrents is real. So don't get you're panties all in a bunch. Yes, I'm talking to you @AJ-jollyroger, @zipline3496 and @pamolama. And lots more too I'm just too lazy to call out everyone who's acting like a little bitch.

Oh, and @jak9090 finale spoiler is fake too."
,cheframsey,2012-06-04T05:41Z,Seed you raging perverts
,jak9090,2012-06-04T05:53Z,WTF JOEFFRY DIES LOL!! BOUT TIME
,r0baralis,2012-06-04T05:59Z,The only thing I am confused about it why is the duration of the episode in this file 1:05 when it has been advertised as a 70 minutes episode?
,jj441,2012-06-04T06:10Z,why is it taking so long to download?? usually takes minutes. its taken an hour to do half???
,DaBiggman,2012-06-04T06:39Z,"ettv you fucker.

This file doesn't play"
,DaBiggman,2012-06-04T06:44Z,"Scratch my last, file is working-needed a restart"
,fabzr34,2012-06-04T07:27Z,"dl really slow on this ep but well worth the wait
thanks ettv"
,korovjov0,2012-06-04T07:39Z,"If these retard spoilertrolls would actually try to name any event that has even a slight chance of occuring, someone probably would even consider taking them seriously. This way I just know that what they spit up, surely won't come to be (even if I would love to see it)."
,Bambikilr,2012-06-04T09:48Z,Thanks! ^^
,andylan13,2012-06-04T10:34Z,"This Torrent didnt work for me, the mp4 would not open in any player, not even VLC. Anyone know how to fix this? VLC doesnt show an error it just doesnt play, it has the time as --/-- and when i click play nothing happens"
,AznAssassin,2012-06-04T10:39Z,"@jak9090 u fcktard, the tv series is based on the books. Whoever gets killed off is evident by reading the books. Stop bullshiting ppl with ur childishness.

And to those douchebags posting 'spoilers', I suggest u find a job, get a girl and get a fcking life instead of trolling + pissing ppl off on piratebay comments (really tats pathetic). People  have read the books so all your bullshit is pointless when everyone knows what happens in season 3, 4 and 5 already. "
,shadowkatt,2012-06-04T11:03Z,best ep so far....
,mav251,2012-06-04T13:16Z,"now a days bunch of ppl r posting false spoiler which makes them twice a looser or better suited phrase is ""forever alone"".if u ppl really want to make use of ur sorry ass life..go piss somewhere else.

the print could have been a little better..but thnx for sharing a gr8 episode,much appreciated "
,DriverAus,2012-06-04T13:34Z,"Thx!
