Synopsis: i've been working on this release for quite some time.. trying to
get as many features working. Most of the problems were on the 64-bit, but
finally got everything fixed: Publishing Manager no longer freezes, etc.
I mainly use Photoshop but have discovered the benefits of Lightroom. If 
you deal with photography, digital images, you want this.. Lightroom provides
more options, higher quality tools, and the results are stunning.

PortableApps.comFormat: 
- runs naturally on your computer, as if installed.
