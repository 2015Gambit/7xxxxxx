I tried the previous version you uploaded and after I made tons of changes to tons of pics, it deleted my catalog; so everything went down the drain. =/

Anyway, this version is looking better. I tried putting your bonus presets where you said, but they're not appearing on Lightroom. And also, where do you recommend I put my own? I ask because I had lots of them (and local adjustment presets) in the previous version but they disappeared along with the catalog.

Anyway, thank you so very much for this."

,gilpessoa,2012-07-19T19:21Z,"Ok, I was stupidly just copying the one file to the specified folder when it's an archive. But still, will it be safe, this time, for my catalog and all the presets?

Just let me say this again: this is a great download and looks like it's working perfectly and I cannot thank you enough."
,gilpessoa,2012-07-20T12:20Z,"I'm sorry for bothering you again, but the program is still deleting presets and not keeping the catalog correctly. Since you mention that we need to open Lightroom at least once before copying presets into the folder, I think this might be the problem; in each Windows session we have to open it at least once and only then copy the presets into the folder. The first time we open it, it'll delete all the presets. I'm not sure, though. I'm using Vista 32 bits, btw."
