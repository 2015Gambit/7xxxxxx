Episodes 7, 8 and 9 are tagged Muxing mode: Header stripping (using MediaInfo).  Avoid us the pain to demux/uncompress before watching pls!"
,AnonymousBasterd,2012-07-21T17:15Z,"Episodes 7-9 have Header stripping, you should've removed it in the first place for saving us time demuxing. Still thanks! Great Up, Highly Appreciated."

Thanks for providing a good and true resolution."
