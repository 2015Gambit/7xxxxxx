,pokes5904,2012-06-05T14:42Z,Is it just me or is the video in this all messed up?
,slatezz,2012-06-05T23:16Z,"yea, video seems to be messed up.  i thought it might be part of the handheld movie aspect, but it goes on for too long."
,omnimodis,2012-06-06T19:55Z,"Yes, video is corrupt all over.  Something went awfully wrong during encoding.  Appreciate the effort though. "
