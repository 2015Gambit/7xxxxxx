good to see you...SU has been blocked for us...was worried abt ur health...thanks for all your efforts mate..."
[V],twentyforty,2012-06-02T11:23Z,"Sanyam have you tried Free Google DNS if your provider block name-resolving? I advised that two moths ago and posted instructions on SU.
Second option is to get, install and use for getting torrents (NOT for later download) HSS-2.18-install-anchorfree-247-conduit3.exe. It's free and it works. Just do not use it for downloads (choose ""Disconnect"" in systray). Get torrents and start from there.
More and more people should expect that from slaves of HollyBolly.

Google for both solutions."

I was really gonna commend U on providing such fantastic print.... really amazing....
A/V = 8.5 both.... it's the best print out there...
the next best wud be a BRrip or DVDrip & believe me the difference is gonna be very slight...
great work man.... really appreciate it....
