,fajarks11,2012-06-07T19:32Z,The Legend of Korra 09 is not out yet? cant wait to continous...
,3htthe,2012-06-09T03:29Z,@fajarks Don't be impatient. Has Episode 09 even aired yet? You realize it has to air before you can actually do something with it.
,hichief,2012-06-09T11:07Z,"@voltan: Have you tried playing it in Windows Media Player Classic? I switched over and it works perfectly. If it doesn't, try downloading and installing the Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP google it). This works wonders and has helped me view tons of videos that were otherwise unwatchable!"
,jchen9999,2012-06-11T00:47Z,can you please upload episode 9
