,JustRacey,2012-06-04T15:49Z, love this series! Love all the books an the download was great! NO password needed! No Fuzzy bar A=10 V=10 I just wish HBO did more than 10 episodes.  There is so much in the books that could be used for additional episodes and those of us that have become GOT addicts could get MORE!!!! HBO wake up- look at the sheer volume of watchers on TV and on sites like this GOT is by far the most popular download!!!

,kratos24,2012-06-24T04:04Z,"hahaha. Okay guys, maybe you ought to read the novels. The creators of the show can't digress from the MAIN story line of the series.

Now Killing off Rakharo in 2nd episode was another matter, coz people don't care who the hell is he, (he is very much alive in the 2nd novel).

But, Kill the dwarf (hahaha, yeah right)."
