If all you do is leech and don't even allow your client to upload WHILE you're leeching, it's slower and less available for EVERYONE INCLUDING YOUR LEECHING ASS.

Actually, I wish the guys behind torrent clients would make it impossible for speed limits to apply to torrents one is downloading, so that it would at least minimize the impact of this behavior. And a long time coming I might add."
