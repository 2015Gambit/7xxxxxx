,xpmule,2012-06-04T15:14Z,"your right no compaq
but it shouldn't matter..
you can use basicly any license for any machine i don't think it matters which one you choose.

I've never bought a pre built computer ever in my life, i build my own always.
I've tried a couple different licenses with this tool and they all worked fine.

If possible i have bought EVGA hardware and use a DELL SLIC/key etc
works great :)
Sounds like a bad choice but i chose Dell because they actualy sell some pc's that use my mobo, so my choice would never look out of the ordinary.

Dude I'm gettin a Dell !
LOL"

I've tried allot of windows 7 loaders, and they all say they are unsupported of my system, Has anyone had any similar problems and did they solve it? i really want windows 7 to work for me since It runs programs I use much smoother than xp... my mobo is asus a8n-e if that's relavant..."
