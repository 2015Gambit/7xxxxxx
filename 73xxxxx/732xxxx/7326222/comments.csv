[V],globeplus,2012-06-04T14:44Z,"To hell911 : unfornatly the mentionated game have archives without the modding possibility and a possible pratical file probably get a ridiculous size around 80% or more from the original file giving a kind of ridiculous effort for this type of work ... sorry but can´t be on this particular game .

To georgegally : everybody that follows my work knows already that i am working seriouly and correctly all the Resident Evil series games until today beside 1 or another game that needs more carefull approach on the work , all the 7 already uploaded files are absolutly great work that anyone can be proud to use , that feeling that independtly of the file sizes the best correct work for the less size possible was done and simply feeling great getting the games no doubt , about the mentionated game , it will be under analysis soon ... to check the possibility of a nice work , i am finishing another Resident Evil series game file for the moment and preparing myself for a possible work on the refered game , i will do my best independtly of the necessary work time and will see what it is possible to get ...  if i like what i saw i will upload , if don´t that i hope not happen well maybe i´ll pass but you can count with the best from me on the work application to get the best correct work for the less size possible , you can bet on that ... see you ."

tnx for replying, i was about to spam in 3 of your latest torrent :)"
,georgegalily,2012-06-04T22:45Z,"I appreciate your Great efforts Globe.
I Already posted 3 Thanx replies in a 3 Resident Evil of yours.
But when I saw your Last Work  On RESIDENT EVIL - Operation Tycoon until (RESIDENT EVIL SURVIVOR 1+2, Y-Day)
I though It was hard to work a long to other releases like MP3
ThanX Very much AGAIN"
[V],globeplus,2012-06-05T00:59Z,"To georgegally : thank you for your correct and honest appreciation of my work but i have news to you : i can´t get the max Payne 3 running on my computer after 3 installs because the Rockstar social club bullshit stuff or the crack , unfornatly after making some research i find out that real buyers of the game getting similar problems and trying to use cracks , i have a deal to you , if i get the game going you probably can got a file from me otherwise forget and i have to resignate to the fact that i can´t run the game only if a complete trustfull crack comes out or something ... it is borring and sad but it is lot of work that i need to test on the game and without the game running it is impossible to do any work ... see you and happy files to you wherever they are ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-06-05T10:53Z,"To georgegally : sorry but i decide quitting on the work om Max Payne 3 and only try again if any valid support for issues with the Social Club or a new crack that works comes up , i decided to get back on track on the Resident Evil series games files and the resident Evil 2 it is on his way , maybe later today available and it will be the 8th Resident Evil game file in a shorter period of time and a little secret between us and all the readers of this comments : when i got all the series worked with the last file that will not have too much size , in fact it will be the shortest series game , a magnific interface will be available for all the games series then more game files from the Resident Evil GLOBE collection you have , more games will work on the buttons on the interface , for example you have 3 games downloaded and ready to go , you move them to the interface folder and that games will be available by a single click on the interface that will have available all the series available by a single click ... simply fantastic ... happy games to you and have a nice day ."
,IDFK1,2012-08-08T09:35Z,"I'm trying to play Resident Evil Survivor 1 and I can only get to the start menu. I can't get past that because of the control scheme I guess but I click every Key on the Keypad and still nothing. It's only stuck at the beggining in the start menu. Any suggestions? Oh I forgot to mention that I tried Survivor 2 and it worked perfectly fine, just not Survivor 1."
