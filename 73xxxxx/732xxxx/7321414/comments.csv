,cuttinace,2012-06-02T23:46Z,100% legit. Thanks.
,phibins,2012-06-03T00:21Z,Can someone (or YIFY)  explain to me how is YIFY compressing these 1080p movies to under 2GB?
,phibins,2012-06-03T00:25Z,"After Google:

Question:           How do you do it? Making movies so small, yet such good quality?

Answer:           Magic hehe. But in all seriousness I use a combination of software and settings that I have found to work best. For beginner encoders I recommend Handbrake and Format Factory, very powerful tools that do a really good job."
,d4rkraid,2012-06-03T07:42Z,"thanks for the release.

YIFY..i have a request. Can you please provide more info in the NFO, such as video codec used (im assuming all releases are AVC/x264), audio info (codec, # of channels, bitrate)?"
,zeroheritage,2012-06-04T05:57Z,@d4rkraid:  Thats what I was wondering too.  Im just curious about audio quality; I assume there's a sacrifice there to make it so small
,lucky87,2012-06-04T22:42Z,"excellent quality video and audio.

ps3 users - it does have Cinavia, so be ready to change the time up an hour every 20 minutes. worth it though for all the boobies"

,xAKSHx,2012-07-04T01:05Z,"Hey YIFY

Quality Is Great, Love The Uploads

But all the 1080p Movies Have Cinavia On Them, When Played On The PS3. 

Can You Switch To .AVI ? Or Please Try To Fix These Errors.

Thanks Mate. You The Best."
