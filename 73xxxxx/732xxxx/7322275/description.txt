A rare gem of Brazil, Milton Nascimento is truly a one-of-a-kind singer, composer and musician. He's the ultimate [i]mineiro[/i] despite the fact that he was born in Rio. The sky, the earth, the rivers, the people and the soul of Minas Gerais itself lie deeply within his music. [i]Bituca[/i]'s voice is the voice of a world that shouts love to every conceivable and inconceivable direction.
