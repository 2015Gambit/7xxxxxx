 Below this comment, may exist spoilers. We have a disrespectful human being called @mentallyours who posts useless and insulting comments.
 You don't read under any circumstances his comments if you don't want to know the score of the game!
You've been warned!"

,mentallyours,2012-06-04T11:16Z,"Dwyane Wade missed an open 3-pointer as time expired, allowing the Boston Celtics to escape with a 95-93 overtime win over the Miami Heat in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. With the victory, Boston has tied up the series at 2-2, rallying from a 2-0 deficit. Paul Pierce had a team-high 23 points for the hosts, who led by as many as 18 points in the first half and had put up 61 points by halftime. The Celtics cooled off in the second half though, the Heat fought back to tie the game behind the outstanding play of LeBron James (29 points) early in the fourth quarter, before sending the game into overtime. Both James and Pierce fouled out in overtime, as Boston's defense tightened up late limiting Miami to just two points over the five minute extra session to hold on for the victory.
