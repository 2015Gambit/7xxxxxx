Note to the Nordic FTP-Scene▼: You say you hate torrents, but when
a ripper wants to compete in the scene, the Siteops won't
take him under their wings, and since I want some credit for my rips 
(and beat a lot of scenereleases), as a protest I leak to TPB,
since I'm not member of any private trackers - i think you
will find my rips as proper as anyone else according to TDRS2011. You
shouldn't judge me for my afilliation with DREAM. As you might have noticed,
my name wasn't even mentioned in the scenenotice. I can't be blamed for
a big-mouthed Gadmin I could be the father of. For fuck's sake - I was
in the scene way back in 1986! Now that I havw stated mny case, I hope
Nordic sites/Siteops will grant me access to pre on their site(s). I suddenly 
got this eerie feeling established groups (and especially the Swedish ones),┬¿
don't really want competition on the larger titles. I tried like crazy to find a
site to pre War Horse twenty days before iNCOGNITO pred theirs, but i really only
know three siteops. and the one I tried to pre with said: "Sorry, no more room 
for new groups." A bit into the conversation he said he knew i had been afilliated
with DREAM. How long shall I suffer for grabbing the first oppertunity to get into
the scene?

Just my two scents. /Thr33way
