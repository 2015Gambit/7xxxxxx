Desecration - The Ninth Book in the Left Behind Series

Believers in Jerusalem must flee or take the mark of the beast.

His Excellency Global Community Potentate Nicolae Carpathia, no longer pretending to be a pacifist, has ordered every Morale Monitor armed as he prepares to travel along the Via Dolorosa and then onward to the temple, where shocking surprises await.

The lines are drawn between good and evil as God inflicts the first Bowl Judgment upon the flesh of those who have taken the mark, while his chosen ones flee to the wilderness, on the brink of Armageddon.
