I convereted it all into MP3 wih a bit rate of 320 if anyone prefered it in MP3 format. Hope it was all worth it. I know it's not as amazing as FLAC, but I just convered it so I could put it all on my iPod, so thought I might as well share it. Special thanks for insinuendo for the torrent and a very big thanks to jps176 who took all the time to rip the music and scannng all the extras from the trunk.
