,cbkid,2012-06-05T14:49Z,"Quick question any help would be great. When watching sbs on my wdtvlivehub media player. When i watch a movie that requires subtitles, the subtitles gets split up half the sentence on 1 side and the other on the other side, it's not readable. So instead of the subs coming up in the middle of the screen in one sentence it is broken up. If that makes sense any help will be great thank you."

,thomasburns,2012-06-06T13:53Z,"Please could someone explain why when trying to play a 3D file on my Samsung series 6 3D tv all I get is two images side by side? I'm sure I must be being stupid but I can't seem to find the right settings to make it work. Please help.

Many thanks as always to YIFY, you are the greatest"

,nahtnas,2012-06-09T15:19Z,"@cbrbhar, 

1. Download and put Nero AAC decoder and Aften to same folder of your choice. 
2. Create batch file containing:
Code:
NeroAacDec -if %1 -of - | aften -readtoeof 1 - %1.ac3
3. Create a short-cut to this batch file.
4. Drag and drop your AAC file to this short-cut.

thats it man"

Thanks !!!"
,gokuu79,2012-06-20T00:35Z,Hey yify are your 3d movies a 3d DVD rip or are you using a program to convert them to 3d your self?
,davin_g,2012-06-22T05:27Z,I have a question. All of YIFYs videos are all pixalated after I burn them and watch them on my Samsung Tv. I use visual hub to convert and burn. Is it just his videos are low quality or is there a trick when burning 3d movies because all other movies I burn the quality is fine. TY YIFY...just wondering if I'm the one doing something wrong.
,kuebel,2012-06-22T15:23Z,How is it possible that all YIFY 3d movies run smooth on my 3d LG via internal media player but the IMAX movies (under the sea and born to be wild) do not run at all...my tv says: incorrect file and does not even start to play.....although those movies are the same format as the other files like journey 2 or this tron legacy which work perfectly??? 
,JumpinJimmy,2012-08-25T15:37Z,"If YFIY hasn't got it it aint worth getting. 
Love the .mp4 files as i put them straight into my ATV2 ......
Cant ask for much more. Keep it up YIFY :-))"
