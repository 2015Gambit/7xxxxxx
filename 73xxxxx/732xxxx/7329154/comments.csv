,Paul-mc,2012-06-06T05:17Z,"On 6 June 2012, the ratio of seeders/leechers is such that you might as well forget about downloading this torrent.
I suggest that you try 'The Diamond Jubilee Concert' uploaded by albiondean. As I write, it shows 754 seeds and 1,793 leechers, and it's downloading on my PC at 649.3 kB/s"
,sapper71,2012-06-09T12:16Z,"thanks for this speed and quality excellent. Shame it was so badly staged,and most of the acts had no relevance other than pals of Gary Barlow. who is obviously fishing for a knighthood.
The comedians except peter kaye appeared to be completley unrehearsed."
