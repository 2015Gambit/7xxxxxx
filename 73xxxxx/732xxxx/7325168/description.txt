The Little Red Box of Protest Songs [Proper] (3CD Box Set, 320kb)

3 CDs celebration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of the first American protest song book, "The Little Red Song Book." The compilation follows the 
beginning of the protest song in the U.S. from the first half of the last century up to the '50s. Features cuts from Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Leadbelly, The Weavers, others. 


''The Little Red Song Book'' first appeared in the US in 1909. It contained songs that took traditional hymns and set pro-Union work songs to them to be sung at rallies and demonstrations across America for the Industrial Workers of the World party: the `Wobblies'. The most famous song writer in the movement was Joe Hill whose infamous death made him a legend to future protest singers such as Seeger & Guthrie who took the Wobblies ideals into the Forties and Fifties on the New York Folk scene.
Black artists moved from the South looking for fairer working and living conditions and they teamed up with Seeger and Guthrie and the rest to add their voice to 
what was fast becoming a major movement. The powers that be felt threatened by the movement and its momentum was lost as the `Red Scare' swept away any liberal minded artists and individuals. 
Seeger, however, managed to emerge again in the late Fifties and early Sixties to help usher in a new wave of protest song with artists like Bob Dylan taking the message and spreading it across the world. 

Although the songs on this collection are from a bygone era the messages they convey and the struggles they highlight are still scarily relevant in today's world and remind of us a time when people thought music really could make a difference to peoples lives and attitudes.
