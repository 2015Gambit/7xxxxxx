,DavidVArt,2012-06-05T01:55Z,"Hey guys, amazing work!!!  I'm not sure if this is the correct way to request things since I'm new here so I apologize in advance if this isn't the place.  Is there anyway you guys could put up Spawn 215-current and Super Dinosaur 1-current?  It'd be a huge help.  TPB is the only place I know to download stuff and its slim picking on those titles.(as far as current stuff at least)  Luckily Invincible is up to date so thanks for that.  I've also looked everywhere for Haunt 22-current with no luck.  But I'd greatly appreciate if you could do Spawn 215-current and all of the Super Dinosaur series.  

You guys make my week with the work you do and I can't thank you enough.  From myself and my nephew, we sincerely thank you for the hard work.  You guys are the best!!!"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-06-06T04:45Z,"DavidVArt - Thanks mate.

Ill keep an eye out -  I am actually surprised myself that no one uploads Spawn here ...

You may want to duplicate this message on other big uploaders' recent torrents, as its always better to have multiple people looking or someone may have these in their collection"
