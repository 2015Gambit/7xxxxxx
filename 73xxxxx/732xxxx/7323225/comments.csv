,noeldieg0,2012-06-04T19:57Z,"I'm just uploading because i found it really difficult to find. Once i found it (at the comments of another torrent) i decided to upload and let people see how useless this app is.

I tried to use it with safari (installed all the libraries and plugins it asked me to install), chrome and firefox. No success with anyone.

I'm still looking for the Witch app ( from the same company, Many Tricks). My trial period it's over."
