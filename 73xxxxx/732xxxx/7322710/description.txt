Never Get Raided (Never Get Busted Volume 2)


This newly released film is the second in Barry CooperΓÇÖsΓÇÖ series of controversial NeverGetBusted videos. The title, NeverGetRaided, describes the DVD perfectly. Part documentary and all instruction, NeverGetRaided promises to reveal all the latest drug enforcement tactics giving the viewer confidence in maintaining a cannabis culture lifestyle without ever being raided!

Alongside the cannabis friendly citizens, the non-smoker will enjoy the film as well because it interestingly catalogs secret police tactics and gives the audience an insiderΓÇÖs view into what caused one of AmericaΓÇÖs top drug cops to ΓÇ£switch sides.ΓÇ¥
