ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS

George OrwellΓÇÖs Animal Farm is a literal masterpiece unmatched in its sarcastic portrayal of our exploitive political systems.

This book is mostly seen as a satire on communism, especially the Russian Revolution, but itΓÇÖs more than just a satire of one particular political system. ItΓÇÖs a comment on human nature and power politics in general. The entire spectrum of human idiocy is portrayed in a manner so brilliantly and with such devastating wit, that no one who reads it can remain untouched.

The Plot revolves around an animal farm owned by one Mr. Jones. The animals of the farm realizing that they are being exploited by mankind for their selfish needs, without getting much in return, rebel against Mr. Jones under the guidance of PIGS ΓÇô prominent among them being ΓÇô Snowball and Napoleon. Pretty soon, the pigs take on the leadership mantle and began lording over the other animals of the farm. What follows next is a power struggle between Snowball and Napoleon. While Snowball relies on his brains and oratory skills, Napoleon uses muscle power of the dogs and support of the idiotic sheep to finally overthrow Snowball and becomes the undisputed dictator of the farm. What follows next, is the systematic destruction of all values and liberties of all the animals, slaughter of dissenters and consolidation of power through lies and insinuations by propaganda channels.



The brilliancy of the book lies in the masterly depiction of political machinations and how the idiocy and stupidity of the ordinary animals allow the political pigs to upsurp power and perpetuate the same exploitation that once they suffered at the hands of humans.

Though the book was written way back in 1946 and takes obvious potshots at the Russian communist system, the machinations depicted are very much similar to what we see even now in every country including the so-called democracies.
