Dedicated: A Salute To The 5 Royales

Steve CropperΓÇÖs new album ΓÇ£DedicatedΓÇ¥ was released on August 9, 2011. The album salutes one source of Cropper's legendary 'soul man' guitar style, the half-forgotten R&B group the 5 Royales, whose guitarist Lowman Pauling wrote standards such as "Dedicated to the One I Love" and "Think". An all-star guest list is included in the album dedicated to the Royales. Cropper's guitar leads an impeccable band of legendary performers on the album. Sharon Jones and Bettye Lavette provide seasoned and soulful vocals, Steve Winwood brings melody, Brian May Queen-style multitracks, and BB King with his authentic and masterful blues sound. This album is a gem and definitely worth a listen for fans of sixties style R&B, soul music, and funky old rock n roll.
