,WinterGale,2012-06-03T15:45Z,"I just tried the installer today and it worked flawlessly...once you open the installer, an installation program and Adobe Air Installer (was surprised by this too) should open. Just open the installer inside the DMG file. "
,creative_expansion,2012-06-06T13:09Z,"i just did hun, i got this message....... sorry an error has occurred The application could not be installed because the installer file is damaged. Try obtaining a new installer file from the application author.
