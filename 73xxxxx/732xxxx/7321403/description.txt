A white paper which explains why 'Security' is failing all over the place, and how it can be done right.


It is a very confrontational paper for most so called insiders who are somehow "selling security" in some form or an other, like those who work for Symantec, CISCO, Checkpoint, SANS, PwC, MickeySoft, ISACA, CERT's, thousands of security companies, plust all those self-serving IT departments.. 
So, it's not intended for those people, but for people who Are in a leadership position where they can decide a different path and actually make it happen. 

It not only applies to Information Technolgy, but also other areas, like sea- & air-port protection, industrial espionage, and such things.

The last pages are filled with self-incriminating quotes from prominent so called "Security Experts".
