,zelatur7,2012-06-03T14:02Z,These cheats don't work. Any clues?
,hrt09,2012-06-03T15:23Z,"@zelatur7

Use the cheat as mentioned in the pdf description.
Note: this this cheats are for PC only"
,LoLzzz2,2012-06-03T17:04Z,"in the pdf ... it says that :
""you need to start maxpayne.exe with the command line parameter
""-developer"".""
You mean something like this in the PlayMaxPayne3.exe ???
""E:gamesMax Payne 3PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" ""-developer""

This part I don't understand."
,gandles,2012-06-03T17:17Z,this doesnt work with reloaded..ive tried with every exe and f12 does shit
,zelatur7,2012-06-03T17:28Z,"@hrt09

I know that. I did what the file says and the console is not even opening.

Is the cheats works for you? You could write here what you exactly do, i would be grateful."
,hrt09,2012-06-03T18:01Z,"there is a file ""commandline.txt"" in the game folder.

add or change the line to ""-developer""

Now run the game in developer mode. while running the hit F12 and add the given cheat codes.

It is working in all cracked max payne3 and orginal max payne 3.

I don't know about PS3 and xbox360"

,hrt09,2012-06-03T18:06Z,"@gandles

No it work fine in reloaded crack.

but it depends on the game you have downloaded 

for example: there is a max payne 3 26 GB torrent there is nothing ripped off.

And It also works on 16 GB max payne torrent from vaisak. he only ripped the multi player.

I don't know about the black box version 10 GB."
,gandles,2012-06-03T18:26Z,i have the 26gig version and addind that to the text still doesnt work
,zelatur7,2012-06-03T18:29Z,"@hrt09 holy shit i start thinking you are stupid or something..

Now we get info there is a file ""commandline.txt"" which is totally bullshit, because there isn't. 

You saying in the game folder, but you cant add some plus more letters for say to us ""WHERE EXACTLY IT IS!!!""

I've searched the whole game folder. There is not such a file.

Now please tell how to make this work or I will think you are just a stupid ass with small cock and saying bullshit."
,hrt09,2012-06-03T18:52Z,"Sorry my mistake.

To this

Make a shortcut of MaxPayne3.exe on desktop
Right click and select properties of the shortcut
Add the command line parameter -developer, in the game path.
Once you have the game running in developer mode, you get access to the game console with F12.
Type ShowFPS in the game console.
Have fun!"

add the cheat"
,gandles,2012-06-03T20:15Z,none of that works and you have to play using playmaxpayne3.exe..the console doesnt work at all..no matter what you try
,zelatur7,2012-06-03T23:00Z,@hrt09 stop saying bullshit! use your brain! Give us new and true information! Did you even try this at your own? I doubt that.
,Loki_uk,2012-06-03T23:08Z,"OK.
Dude as the guy said the game is not starting from maxpayne3.ese hence making a shortcut for it has no point. how will we go about starting in dev mode when all our games only start with playmaxpayne3.exe. i doubt that making a shortcut for this exe and adding the dev command at the end will enable the console.
so... your turn mr hrt09"
,thcfreak666,2012-06-03T23:40Z,"This is a dump Fake, please admins delete this hoax and ban hrt09 for ever.

@hrt09 I donÂ´t know what you  try us to say, and i think you are a 12 years old child by learning PDF Creator.Show it your mother and stop to spam us. So I hope you will banned and your mother is giving you Computer ban.

Sorry for my bad English, i came form Germany."

no no ... let him explain his upload... it's like talking to Jesus... no one agrees but he knows best... maybe he can perform miracles."
,hrt09,2012-06-04T11:00Z,"i don't know what you guyz are saying.

therre are only 2 ways of doing this cheat work.

1 : Make a shortcut of MaxPayne3.exe on desktop
Right click and select properties of the shortcut
Add the command line parameter ""-developer"", in the game path.
Once you have the game running in developer mode, you get access to the game console with F12.
Type the cheat

2 : create a file called ""commandline.txt"" in the main game dir. and Add the command line parameter ""-developer"" then save the file. run the game then click f12 and enter the cheat codes"
,zelatur7,2012-06-04T11:41Z,"@hrt09 DO YOU REALIZE WE CAN'T RUN THE GAME BY ""maxpayne3.exe""??? 

Only ""PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" works, and adding there command ""-developer"" do exactly NOTHING.

Creating ""commandline.txt"" in main folder with ""-developer"" command in it, do nothing."
,DugTaylor,2012-06-04T12:06Z,"I second what zelatur7 said. Neither of the methods work for people who used the RELOADED crack. If you figure something out that could make the console work for us, you'd be highly appreciated."
,3Dazz,2012-06-04T13:35Z,"Hey guys, dont get all worked up about this obvious copy and paste from a popular cheats site, I tried this in every way possible and could not get it to work. It did remind of the Far Cry 2 exe cheat. Anyway the reason I'm posting on here is if your looking for trainers or cheats, go to the GameWorld.com site and theres 3 different trainers there.http://www.gamew0rld.com/   Cheers guys."
,zelatur7,2012-06-04T16:35Z,@3Dazz Thanks! I tried a 6plus trainer on this site and it works.
,WuHaPe,2012-06-04T20:28Z,this is fake...look at the cheats... Colt Commando? wow they are from MP1
,prosinnerme,2012-06-06T02:12Z,installed as instructed still can't get this thing to work. So fustruated!
,karm42yn,2012-06-10T20:12Z,This is a fake of course. It's all copied from mp1. so far rockstar has not released access to dev-mode. i don't think they ever will
