Thanks anyway though, seriously much appreciated."

,LateByte2,2012-06-10T15:53Z,"The files are encoded by CBS, 90% of the time I simply download the web stream source file and torrent it up for everyone. The files are FLV based at source, despite the MP4 container (or whatever) so yes, you will have trouble playing them on PS3 etc. You will need to convert the files to the format you require yourself. These webrips are only designed to be a stop gap measure until standard scene versions are available. The files will however work fine on a PC using WMP or VLC etc.

As for this weeks' ferguson, sorry, I've been away on holiday. Currently working through the back log. 

Many thanks

Peace."
