,Capt.Lee,2012-06-04T07:47Z,This is a good Torrent and yes you have to go completely off line to play it after you install. But after you get the game going you can return online.

,niggersex,2012-06-05T03:57Z,"does anyone alive know the solution for the keyboard not working at all in the game?
I've looked everywhere and I know at least a handful of other people have the same problem. I tried everything from reinstalling .net framework to reinstalling the game, tried every crack, tried safemode, none of it works, the keyboard does not work in game, only the mouse. So I cannot play at all, I can only watch the beginning cinematic up to the part where you need to enter bullet time mode.
Please if anyone fixed this, share. "

,lee280269,2012-06-05T22:30Z,"Not working for me at all unfortunately
re-installed repeatedly for last 24hrs and tried everything. Stuck on Max Payne 3 loading screen. Social club wont start so pressing home button does nothing. Installed offline and ran game offline.
tried various cracks + updates etc same result every time.
Even re-installed win 7 x64 sp1 & fully updated it online. Installed my hardware with latest mobo, video drivers etc removed internet drivers then retried Max Payne 3 install again and same thing stuck on Max Payne 3 loading screen with no cpu activity.
Manually installed the profiles in social club (they were already there anyway) manually installed cracks + updates and dlc (they were there already).
Donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t know what else to try to get this game working. any ideas????"
,orange7,2012-06-06T04:45Z,"Well, I finally got it working. I had the stuck at loading problem, heres what I did

I installed the game to
C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3

Let the install do its thing after it was done,

I then updated rockstar social club by using the installer contained on the iso.

Played it.

Hope this helps

,lee280269,2012-06-06T16:54Z,"Thanks orange7:

Update: Working ! Finally Fixed stuck at loading screen.
Installed Social Club 1st C:Program Files(x86) as i'm running Win 7 x64.
Intsalled Max Payne 3 to Rockstar Games folder so it sits next to social club folder NOT black box folder.
Disconnected internet and ran game and it now works.

Many thanks black box just need to readdress where it installs too as for me the default Black Box folder location made it stick at the Max Payne loading screen."

,FlankerB1,2012-06-08T18:48Z,"@lee280269:
You don't need to install it after social club and in a rockstar games folder. You don't even need to disconnect the internet. I've installed the game to a folder of my choice, blocked both playmaxpayne3.exe and maxpayne3.exe with avast internet security's firewall and played it almost normally (I actually have to start it using the launcher not the automaticly created shortcut)."

,helppleasehelp,2012-06-10T08:11Z,"I'm having the same problem with the keyboard not working in game, or in game menu. alt+tab, and ctrl+alt+del work, tried 2 different keyboards, still no luck.

Only a handful of people seem to be having this problem. Any idea's on why? This is really frustrating. Any help would be appreciated. "
,filipsch,2012-06-11T13:16Z,"How I solve everything

1. Run Setup
2. Check all (DirectX, VC++, Social Club), dont check shortcut - you dont need it
3. Start installing
4. It will also start installing MP3_Launcher.exe (install it)
5. Check your antivir if it doesnt point out gsrld.dll in your quarantine, if so... restore it and make it for an exception
6. Throw your net cabel out from your PC (its need to be done !!!!!)
7. Launch PlayMaxPayne3.exe as an administrator from directory of Max Payne 3
8. It will write there... you need internet connection to update
9. Click on Offline mode
10. Max Payne starts, you dont need to create an account
11. Enjoy

Everything works for me. Tested on Vista SP2 32bit. Hope it will help you."

All for nothing. Now, I appreciate the effort the uploader made, but this game just won't start, and I have no idea what to do.
