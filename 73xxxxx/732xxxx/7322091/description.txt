The plot is basically as simple as ΓÇ£we'd find them, or they'd find usΓÇ¥ ΓÇô you have to observe the moves of alien ship, predict its whereabouts and fire missiles to destroy it before the enemy gets a chance to approach your warship. 

Combining elements of shooting and strategy game, this battleship game can give you an exciting gaming experience while still leaving space for calculation and strategy. You need to carefully observe every move of the alien warship to deploy your missile to wait for them and command it to fire at the right moment the ship comes by. 
Since it takes a few moments for the missile to hit its objective, you got to develop a sense of timing to balance the speed of the missile and the speed of the intruding battleship. You are only armed with 4 missiles in one game level, so itΓÇÖs quite challenging as you canΓÇÖt afford to miss the target too many times and the acts of your enemy will get more and more complicating to predict at advanced level. 

While Battleship is more about quiet thinking, the simple yet strong graphic design and stunning sound effects can give you real feeling of a naval combat. It employs an easy-to-use interface of the radar screen with red spots representing the presence of the enemy ship.

HOW TO PLAY?

Player have to predict where the alien ships move and launch missiles just in time before the alien ships approachs their ship.
