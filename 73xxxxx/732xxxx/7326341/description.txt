    Judge Vishnu Sahai was brought up in      
    an orphanage and has no knowledge of      
    his family background nor of his          
    religion. He is married to beautiful      
    Mala, who he loves very much, and he      
    has a loyal and trusting friend in        
    Rajan. He is very much revered and        
    respected in the city of Gorakhpur.       
    One day he travels to Mussoorie to        
    attend a case. He meets with a stranger,  
    they share a table, then they play cards. 
    After playing cards Vishnu passes out,    
    and when he wakes he finds himself under  
    arrest for the murder of one Dhanraj.     
    Angered at this, he loudly voices his     
    innocence, that he is a Judge. But he
