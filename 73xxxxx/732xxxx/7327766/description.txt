Having recorded two albums and some EPs, Jessie Baylin's Little Spark presents a confident singer-songwriter, rather than that of an indie artist struggling to find her voice.
This could easily be described as one of those albums that attempts to lock onto a "retro" sound. Baylin, however, is smart enough to know that time, as well as music, moves forward. It is for this reason that I loved every bit of this album.

Of the 11 solid tracks that make up this album, "The Greatest Thing That Never Happened To Me", "Dancer" and "The Winds" are the ones I felt most connected to. I dug the first one because it sort of makes you think you are listening to a more somber sounding version of Sara Bareilles' "Love Song". The second one appeals to me because it's always nice to have a track you can imagine playing while kissing your girlfriend. I like the third track because it sounds like the kind of song that would be played during the more hellish times during a relationship.
I credit the album's producer, Kevin Augunas, and chief arranger Richard Swift with Little Spark's retro vibe without completely lacing each track as if it were from that era. In a time where music seems to want to cherry-pick styles of music from decades past, it's good to know a couple of guys came together with such a love for the past without completely feeling lost in it.
I wouldn't be surprised if this album was able to get some kind of nomination for an award. It has a bit of an underdog quality and frankly showcases that Jessie Baylin could be a force to be reckoned with in the future. Every year can't be Bieber, Bieber, Bieber all the time.
