After receiving some positive feedback on my first torrent (and people who can't believe a 36 kbps audio file could sound so good) here's another. I don't particularly like the entire album, but the second song "Whoever You Are" is one of my favorites.

The music files are compatible with iTunes, Windows Media Player, VLC, pretty much anything.

I included album art. It's in WebP format which hasn't exactly become a standard by any meansΓÇª but if you pull it into Google Chrome you can see it. :D
