In April, 1940, when World War II was, for Britain at least, in a kind of holding pattern and waiting to burst forth into the savage fury that would soon engulf the entire world, the British Air Purchasing Commission (BAPC) requested that North American Aviation, Inc. (NAA) build 300 Curtiss P-40s for the R.A.F. Had ΓÇ£DutchΓÇ¥ Kindelberger, NAAΓÇÖs President agreed to this, what is generally considered to be the greatest piston engine fighter aeroplane ever built would have never been created. Instead, NAA counter offered that they could produce a superior aeroplane to the P-40 and agreed to do it in 120 days. 102 days later the first Mustang airframe was completed, and 47 days after that the first Mustang flew. It went on to serve in every theatre of the War and in every Allied air force. A total of 16,766 were built, making it the most numerous American fighter aircraft. Because of the great care and attention to aerodynamic detail that went into its brilliant design, the Mustang was, from its inception, one of the fastest single-engine piston aeroplanes of the W.W. II era.
