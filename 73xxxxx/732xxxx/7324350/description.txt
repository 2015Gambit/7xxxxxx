Though first published in 1995, this book is still contemporary and a good introduction to 'the new physics'.
For a theoretical physicist, Professor Michio Kaku possesses the rare skill of being able to distil complex ideas down to basics to help the layman unschooled in Riemann's metric tensor, general relativity, quantum and Kaluza-Klein theories to understand how leading-edge physics is exploring new models of what we call reality. He is also, as we all know, something of a media star who in the past 20 years has carved out a strong brand as the enthusiastic expert face of advanced physics on TV - a position previously occupied by the late Carl Sagan. His high public profile almost certainly boosts sales of his books and lends greater credibility to their content in the eyes of the reader mainly uninformed on this subject matter.
In 334 pages of intelligent and densely written narrative, the long-haired Prof explains with refreshing lucidity how physicists have grappled with mathematical and experimental models to understand the laws of nature, the effort to unite the four known universal forces (electro-magnetism, gravity, the strong and weak nuclear forces) under one symmetry, how the revolutionary breakthrough of superstring theory by postulating the 10- and 26-dimensional universe might (though the theory cannot currently be experimentally verified) finally achieve this; and the resultant implications for the existence of hyperspace, wormholes to other dimensions and time travel - which he demonstrates as theoretically possible despite the paradoxes. The fundamental thesis of the book is to demonstrate to the lay reader how complex and seemingly contradictory phenomena (like quantum and relativity theories) simplify and unify in higher dimensions - a difficult idea to deal with for lesser mortals but Kaku succeeds to an admirable degree. He even discourses on God, the existence of whom has often been debated in high-level physics not as a theological abstract or personal belief, but as a necessary initiator of a universal order otherwise unexplainable - the "God of Order", not the "God of Miracles".
The author gives us brief bios of many mathematicians and physicists who have made major contributions to understanding the universe over the past 200 years or so, knows his geopolitical history and seems to have also read a fair amount of science fiction (the thoughtful kind from authors like Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke). He uses many of these stories to illustrate the advanced concepts he is trying to explain.
