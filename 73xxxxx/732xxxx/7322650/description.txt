In order to build a bootable USB, users will obviously need to have at least one USB port on their computers.

Even though there are ways to create bootable floppy disks and USB using Windows command line, most users prefer the ease of use of a GUI (graphical user interface).

Bootable USB drives will need to be formatted first, therefore all the data stored on them will need to be transferred to another location.

Some creators of bootable USB will resort to installing a Linux distribution onto the flash drive, but this does not mean that the OS of the host computer will be affected.
