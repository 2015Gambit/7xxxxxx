,NexiumCore,2012-06-03T04:51Z,"The Jar file located inside the rar is known as an executable jar file. After installing Java, the Jar file will execute exactly like an exe. You are going to need to install Java in order to play Minecraft anyways."
,flarehl,2012-06-03T21:24Z,Java is already installed. 
,flarehl,2012-06-03T21:50Z,"Ah, sorry, I had to update to the new java. It didn't notify me, sorry for the trouble."
,NexiumCore,2012-06-04T03:09Z,No trouble at all.

,NexiumCore,2012-06-07T21:12Z,"In the next release or two I will be making the program more dynamic so you can choose only to download the versions of Minecraft that you want. With every new release of Minecraft this program will get bigger, and therefore run some people off because of the shear size. I just want everyone to know that I will be fixing this problem shortly.
