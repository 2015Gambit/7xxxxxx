,donotcare,2012-06-02T02:05Z,whats on the list? appreciate everything!
,cryptonit,2012-06-02T13:53Z,Can you tell what software you use to convert from MKV to iTunes compatible format (with subtitles)? Is it Handbrake or something else?
,Hamodee,2012-06-02T19:26Z,"hey guys, would you mind telling me what does ""1080p iTunes"" means ??"
,bluebuury,2012-06-02T19:45Z,"@Hamodee do you seriously not know what 1080p means? It's just the video quality of the movie, and itunes means that it compatible with itunes."
,essamfhs,2012-06-02T20:41Z,"Hey tr108! I absolutely love your uploads. You seriously have the best quality available thank you so much! Is there anyway you could possibly do ""The Woman in Black"", ""This Means War"" & ""New Year's Eve""?? thank you again & I can't wait for your future work :)"
[T],tr108,2012-06-02T21:52Z,"@lilsean23 - you're welcome for the spanish subs. :)

@donotcare - it'll be quiet for a few weeks, I'm afraid. But I'll be back in mid-June with good stuff for sci-fi/fantasy & animation fans :)

@cryptonit - yes, I use HandBrake. If you're familiar with the program and want to give my settings a shot, you can download my presets and some basic instructions: (It's a 7 Kb ZIP file)
http://www.peejeshare.com/files/362129257/HandBrake_Presets.zip.html

@Hamodee - I labeled this torrent ""1080p"" so that folks understand it can be played back on a computer or device - including those listed in the description - that supports video files with image dimensions up to 1920x1080 and running at 23.98 frames per second. 

All my torrents say ""iTunes"" so that people know what universe it's meant for (my files are .m4v extension instead of the AVI, MKV or MP4 files that other uploaders post) and what features to expect (video is AVC or MPEG-4, must have a AAC audio track, subtitles must be text-based, etc)

@essamfhs - sorry man, but I won't be able to get to any of those flicks soon."
,Hamodee,2012-06-02T22:49Z,"@bluebuury dude come on I know what 1080p means, but I wasn't know is why ""iTunes"" with ""1080"" .. but now I knew it what it is .. thank u 4 clearing up ...

@tr108 thanks a lot man 4 explanation ..."
,Hamodee,2012-06-03T10:46Z,"awesome movie & quality ,,

,bluebuury,2012-06-03T17:08Z,Please seed everyone! I can't even get 0.2% downloaded. :)
,mrme1975,2012-06-08T15:10Z,"The UK ISP's are blocking TPB, where else can I get your movies?  Do you use a different site?  TPB is being shutdown in the UK and soon all ISP's will be legally obliged to block access to the site.  Already Virgin Media, Talk Talk, Sky and a few other ISP's have been forced to block access to TPB by the law courts and people will be unable to download any content within the UK.  "
[T],tr108,2012-06-08T15:46Z,"@mrme1975 - I also post on Demonoid but that's semi-private. Where else should I post? Tell what's not blocked for you guys...

@bluebuury - hope you got it downloaded by now."
,Lenschow123,2012-06-08T17:44Z,"What did you do to make the subs, selectable? :D
I mean, how did you do so that you can change subs or de-select them? :D"
,Skaq,2012-06-08T19:44Z,Is this the extended version?
,mrme1975,2012-06-09T12:21Z,I don't know of any other websites that would be good to use - maybe other users have some ideas? I looked at Demonoid which looked good but you can't look at a particular persons download list as you can here.
,applefangirl,2012-06-21T08:23Z,Your uploads are great and thanks SO much for the Handbreak settings!!!!
