I'm not sure that I will be able to get the TOWIE special as I have to go for an operation next Tuesday, which I have to stay admitted for 10 days, and have been told by my specialists that I cannot sit in front of a computer for longer than 2 to 5 minutes a day for the next 6 weeks :(
Luckily MIC and TOWIE have finished, with the exception of the one-off specials. I will post those when I am allowed to get back to work!!
PS- Thanks for all the thankses peoples :)"
