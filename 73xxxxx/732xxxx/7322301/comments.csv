,cinemaniac905,2012-06-03T22:02Z,not that great of a lecture...he talks too much about other peoples experiences and not enough of his own....and i dunno about his memories of running around on a spaceship and taking a swing at extraterrestrials...seems a little embellished to me. but one cannot discount that something happened as there were multiple witnesses.
,erraticchevy,2012-09-12T17:59Z,"@ cinemaniac905 uh ya of course cause its such an easy topic for him to talk about id like to see you do a lecture about such a traumatic story and see how good you are You Dumbass. Hes telling a true story not a lecture about a movie, and i suppose if it happened to you, you might get on your knees and look for a sex organ to ""embellish"" instead of fighting them off...
