Uniblue Registry Booster 2009
-----------------------------

This is the last release of Registry Booster that has a problem free install with the serial key provided.
Newer versions of the software, dated 2010 or later, use a registration scheme where the product key is verified online against a Uniblue server.
This has allowed Uniblue to black list all publicly known product keys.
