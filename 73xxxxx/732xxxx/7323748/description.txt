Sources - VIDEO: ELEKTRI4KA ....Thanks :P
          AUDIO: ADTRG release ...Thanks :P

Notes -
right here we are with a release of mib 3... the video was real nice but at an angle 

so i had to straighten it up and shightly crop
but it is now straight... altered the contrast brightness adjusted the hsv then ran 

it threw a denoise filter to get rid of a little 
static fuzz.
audio is nice line i took from the ADTRG release which is really nice.. had to make 

a few cuts to sync it but no biggie then muxed to 
our encode....

Enjoy!!
