Drugs Inc. - Hash - National Geographic


The most commonly abused and trafficked illicit drugs in the world are derived from the Cannabis sativa plant. 

Hashish, also called hash, is made from resin heads of glandular trichomes that cover the surface of the buds of the cannabis plant. The trichomes are collected, pressed together, and shaped. The more resin on the cannabis bud, the stronger the hash.
