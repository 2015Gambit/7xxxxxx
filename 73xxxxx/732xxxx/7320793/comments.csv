This is top notch quailty in a quarter of the size of the original. I really hope everyone downloads this version instead of the xvid/divx crap floating around. 

x264 is the best codec out there and this is proof! "

Oh, I see, you're trying to advertise whatever this movie ""Thrive"" is. 
How about you find some new material to upload instead of doing the same shit over and over?"
