,UnkleAmon,2012-06-04T22:52Z,Thanks for the effort.
,capshuna,2012-06-04T23:23Z,"I'm doing my best here but it seems this thing does not want to upload. I can see the peers, they're just not connecting, trackers are valid, any ideas why this is happening?"
,nwagmx1,2012-06-04T23:41Z,err because its a FAKE?
,capshuna,2012-06-04T23:57Z,"OK, I started seeding with 3MB/s, everything is ok.

@nwagmx1 this is not fake by any means, it's just very poor, barely watchable, quality. You can watch it online at the given link but you won't be able to skip throughout."
,eaglstk,2012-06-04T23:58Z,"This is just as the uploader says it is.

For someone very interested and enthusiastic about seeing it, and whose enjoyment is unimpeded by spoilers, this is a lot of fun and very gratifying.  I'm looking forward to seeing it in the theater even more. "
,ChasUGC,2012-06-05T00:01Z,"@capshuna - no big loss, this is a very early release, and not many people speak russian.
just let it sit, it may come back around, you could be in a swarm.

@Anon- thanks for the effort."
,nwagmx1,2012-06-05T00:43Z,Actually I take that back its a russian prometheus but as stated pretty poor quality...
,Muh_Dik,2012-06-05T00:46Z,"Anon is a pretty cool guy, eh lets people know his camrip is shitty up front and doesn't afraid of anything."
,nwagmx1,2012-06-05T01:40Z,Just finished skipping through this and I must say the film looks awesome - can`t wait to see it on the big screen..
,0rochimaru,2012-06-05T06:15Z,Someone should sync this with English audio...
,uid0owl,2012-06-05T07:46Z,Still better than twilight!
,Traumlan,2012-06-05T08:58Z,"Yeah, I watched online but want see some scenes again. This poor quality is highest avail.. I like it.

,dizzyr,2012-06-05T10:46Z,"@nwagmx1, you asshole. Yesterday was a similar torrent(1.4GB) with russian dubbing, but you just said ""fake mailware"" and topic was removed. But a few guys managed to successfully download it."
,nwagmx1,2012-06-05T12:23Z,"@dizzyr that torrent you saw was downloaded by someone who also uploaded approx 10 other torrents all with the same filesize at the same time, - EXACTLY the same filesize . and it was PB who removed them not me."
,mgwump200,2012-06-05T12:54Z,the last scenes missing -SPOILER- the plot is on wikepedia - just google prometheus
,mgwump200,2012-06-05T19:24Z,"Better copy in english here:-

,Cyberjanne,2012-06-05T22:08Z,"You didn't miss anything important with the last scenes, the engineer birthed xenomorph is pathetic and laughable."
