,begzamban,2012-06-06T16:55Z,I've seen the screen shots... It seems good for no DVD release yet... We'll see... -.-
,SeaBiscuits,2012-06-09T04:59Z,"Be aware people, this torrent was recorded in a theater. Therefore it has really blurry quality throughout the film, the camera moves in one scene and a ladies figure can be seen walking across the bottom of the screen."
,Synthesist,2012-06-12T06:00Z,Uhhh.. yeah.. all hallmarks of a bootleg.  Methinks a Hollywood flunky is attempting to dissuade attempts to download this film.

,kurkos_dr,2012-08-22T02:27Z,"Bad. Ok, I understand, this thing is a TS (a TS is a CAM recording with line sound) so some blurriness is to be expected, but this also suffers from compression artifacts. Other TSes/CAMs outhere have either out-of-sync audio or a video rating of 4 (though I understand this is subjective to commenter) so they are actually worse.

If you know of a better quality version, please post. If not, I will wait for the R5 or the DVD, as not to ruin the movie for me."
