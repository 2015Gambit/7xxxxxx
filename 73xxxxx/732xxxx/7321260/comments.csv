Very involved in her own promotion, her voice, a nasally warbling that doesn't compete with other real phenoms like Carrie Underwood, has come at a time when the ""old"" CW female guard is fat, old, and out of touch. Taylor emerged just at the right time in spite of her tepid songs and false eyelashes. I don't want to beat down a real talent, just a mediocre one like her."
