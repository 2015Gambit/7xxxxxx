Thought I'd check out this 1GB 720P copy before I spent a lot of time to download the 5.5 GB 720P copy, and then still have to re-encode it with Handbrake to get it down to an appropriate file size of ~2GB.  1GB is definitely on the low side for 720P and normally I'd stay away, but I've seen decent quality 720P rips at or under 1GB, including others that Zen_Bud has upped, so I gave it a shot.  Unfortunately this wasn't one of them, and it quickly wound up in the Recycle Bin. 

The least of the problems is the 69Kbps stereo audio.  There's just no reason to ever go below 128Kbps 48KHz for any movie, especially an HD 720p file.  It's just a very poor return on investment given the amount of space you save in exchange for the compromised audio quality. 

On to the video...  The biggest problem aside from just generally overly compressed video, is that the areas that aren't moving for more than a second or so start to crawl and transform into an unrecognizable muddy blob, as the encoder settings strain to conserve data bits in areas that mostly repeat from one frame to the next.  Periodically the blob snaps back into shape briefly before repeating the cycle if the scene hasn't changed.  Example: At about 51:40, watch the beige wall just to the left of the bathroom for the 20+ seconds of that scene, and you might start thinking someone slipped you some acid.  That's one very noticable example, but it's happening constantly throughout the movie in less obvious ways, dragging down the overall quality.  The video quality in the darker areas is also very poor, unrelated to the other problems.  That's probably a DCT Terminate issue, coupled with very high compression/low quality video settings.

Suffice to say I'd suggest passing on this particular rip and going with the larger 5.5 GB version, it'll be worth the wait.  To each their own though... "
