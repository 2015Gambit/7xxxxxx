,xLJAx,2012-06-04T09:19Z,Anyone else having problems with the video locking up at a couple points?
,Oneiros42,2012-06-04T10:16Z,I am.  Toward the last half of the show the video will freeze while the audio continues normally.  
,lordmew,2012-06-04T13:27Z,good to know I'm not the only one that the video seems having trouble catching up with The Flash. hope a proper comes out soon...
,seemovies,2012-06-04T13:40Z,"why doesnt anybody release a good xvid copy for this show, im not talking about this week..... its missed out every week"
,zickboi,2012-06-05T16:45Z,"i am having the same issue, but it changes depending on the player i use"
,slybunda,2012-06-06T02:58Z,video freezes at random times. fixed by removing audio stream and remuxing it back in.
