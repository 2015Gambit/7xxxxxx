* Plot :

A year after the attack on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas, an eradication campaign has left the lake uninhabitable by life, and the town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of their main revenue source, tourism.

At a nearby lake, Clayton (Gary Busey) and Mo (Clu Gulager), two farmers, walk into the water to recover the body of a dead cow. Eggs laid inside the cow hatch, and the farmers are killed by a swarm of piranha.
