I couldn't care less if the cutscenes(?) had lesser quality than the original game. The cutscenes are short, anyway. And according to some people, this comes with everything already required so I don't need to search for a crack and the DLC and download them via another torrent separately. 

I was hoping this would be at least a little faster than the Reloaded and Skidrow torrents, but it isn't. I'm still not surpassing .10 kB download and upload speed. Even for the repack version, at this rate it won't be done by Christmas and if that's the case, I might as well just wait until then to get it since I can't get it now, that's for sure.

Just imagine how many leechers there will be when Grand Theft Auto 5 finally releases. Fucking ridiculous. "

1.Download this, then it finishes turn off internet
2.Install (it takes about 3hours, you need to mark DirectX, Visual basic and social club to be installed)
3.Then it finishes install you need to turn off stays internet off and play using offline button.
4.Have FUN :))"

[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-06-03T18:41Z,"Okey here is a simple FIX for you who got Loading problem.
1. Make sure the installer extracted the profiles to ""Documents -> Rockstar Games -> Social Club ->"". 
2. Make sure you installed MP3_Launcher and Social Club.
3. Open notepad or other text editor, in it add this:
PlayMaxPayne3.exe -scofflineonly  
and save it as PlayMaxPayne3.bat and save it-put it in the Max payne 3 game directory.
Start game using PlayMaxPayne3.bat

This is a simple fix you can try if you have the loading problem..."
,SeppoTheSausage69,2012-06-03T18:43Z,"^^^^Sorry, not the loading screen. I meant the installation.
The progress the installer shows: 0.0% and there is no estimated time. What the fuck is wrong? Now I'm PREEETTTTY sure that the installer can't access the .bin files for one reason or another. It doesn't give any error messages either.
This is really frustrating since it doesn't flat out tell that something is wrong or crash."

Deluge - At home = 7/10 - On a server = 9/10
uTorrent - At home = 9/10 - On a server = 5/10

So deluge is better if you having a fast server. But if you just want to have a bittorrent client at home uTorrent is the best."

,relicek,2012-06-04T01:04Z,"I will tell how you will rid of BSOD in crack directory or blackbox version and how to proper install RELOADED version with all updates with no errors or problems. I had problems from friday with this and i solved it now and no problems at all now.

1. Have Windows 7 with SP1, you need SP1 and you will no longer get BSOD for 100%. I had problems with BSOD with reloaded version, even cant opened crack folder on DVD4 and i got BSOD. After i reinstall my old version of windows 7 to newer with SP1 the problem was solved.

2. Install game

3. When installation is finished cancel auto updates when autoupdate window appeared.

4. Open DVD4, Crack folder, Updates and install all 3 exes.

5. Copy dlc folder, binkw32.dll,gsrld.dll and MaxPayne3.exe to your max payne installed folder and rewrite all when asked.

6. Press windows key + R, write wf.msc to command line.  On windows firewall window left up is outbound rules, click on it, then on right click on 'new rule'. Select Program, next, browse for maxpayne3.exe, block the connection, next all check (domain, private, publi), next, name it example: maxpayne.exe and click finish. Make this same for Playmaxpayne3.exe. Now you exes are blocked from connecting to internet.

7. Start PlayMaxPayne3.exe. Click Offline mode. When it starts game (maybe some problems with clicking resolution but it will be fixed in few seconds) just press alt+tab, go to your user documents folder/rockstargames/socialclub/ and here copy from DVD4/crack/profiles folder.

8. Go back to game, press HOME, Sign in, and you will see one account on left, just click on it and you will be logged for your offline mode game without any problems and all game progress will be saved properly.

9. Enjoy game and buy it later as i will do it :)"

To the fellows that have the ""stuck at 'Loading' screen"" phenomenon.

Got this in both the RELOADED and Blackbox version.

If you get this, then 99.9% you haven't completely block the game from the internet. I use the bloody ZA, had blocked the 2 Max Payne exe and i was still getting the ""Loading.."" screen. 

It worked in both versions without prob when i just disabled my network card (easy to enable/disable via device manager). No, i am not suggesting to disable yours temporarily to play the game...i am saying try this and if you DO overcome this prob then don't blame the game(s), just try to figure out what else you need to block from going out the internet."

1)Create your own Social Club account. You don't have to own a game to create one, plus then you can choose what nickname your want to have in online. I had some trouble with the account that came with the game so it's better to have your own.
2)Don't block the game from going online. For the time being it won't download anything since its the latest version. You will notice that the game apparently stops while loading the menu. Don't panic, just hit HOME and log in with your SC account. Well this should be it, but in case it doesn't work:
3)Have Rock Star Social Club installed on your computer. Not sure if BlackBox also installs Social Club.
4)Download and install the LAN-fix from the RELOADED version. Backup the files that will be replaced!
Finally install the latest version of Tunngle and join one of the Max Payne 3 lobbies."

@axm13 Like i said you need to uinstall Daemon Tools/Alcohol120% or any program with virtual drive that uses the sys file (you can use Magic ISO for mouthing iso files and that)
Use this program after you uninstall DT or A120% to remove the *.sys driver http://www.duplexsecure.com/en/downloads

2. What i did next is i plugged off MANUALLY internet just to be sure tried to launch Max Payne 3 and i still had black screen so close MP3 plug in your internet and update your graphic drivers, also if u dont have SP1 on windows 7 install it.
3. Here is most important step i did fallowing this website http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=8efc9b1b845564e5890ffceeeecdcb33&t=2730408&page=2 i changed DirectXVersion value=""2"" to DirectXVersion value=""9"" in C:Users...DocumentsRockstar GamesMax Payne 3graphic.xml
4. After that i read on that forum that i should visit http://support.rockstargames.com/entries/21516788-crashing-back-to-desktop-when-launching-max-payne-3-for-pc website and disable microsoft net. framework 4.0 and install 3.5 if u dont have it, there is all on rockstar website how you should disable it.
5. Next just plug off your internet MANUALLY and start max payne3 after will get after intro you can plug in internet back. Ofc you can try blocking it on firewall but i wont advice it since u wont know if it was your fault or firewall didnt block all connections.
6. Basically just do what guys on that forum and rockstar website say. I fallowed those advices and i can finally play, i've launched it 15minutego go and started chap 1.

Hope i helped you have fun. "

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update that works with this BlackBox version as well: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the nstructions from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)

You MUST disconnect from the Internet when ever starting the game.
You can Alt-Tab out & start the internet after MP3 has started.
The installer already provides a setup Social Club account which will auto sign in when game started.

The 'maxpayne4.exe' the installer puts on the Desktop will NOT start it.
Need to start with 'PlayMaxPayne3.exe'

Both need to be stopped from accessing the Internet.
But Windows FireWall does not do this properly so we have to disconnect when starting the game. @@@@"

,kofadis,2012-06-13T10:36Z,this torrent is working 100%
,kofadis,2012-06-13T10:41Z,but first u need to follow these steps carefully.
,kofadis,2012-06-13T10:41Z,"If anyone says do account or some - dont do it!!!
Don’t do anything with inet!!!

Here’s simple rules how to work for you all: 

1. Download this, then it finishes turn off internet.

2. Install (it takes about 3hours, you need to mark DirectX, Visual basic and social club to be installed).

3. Then when it finishes installing you need to stays offline (internet off) and play using offline button (Playmaxpayne3.exe).

4. And before you press enter at the max payne 3 logo, look if you gets signed in in the upper right corner you press END button not home. 

5. To fix chapter 6 problem you need to Open windows firewall Create outbound rule that blocks Maxpayne3.exe

6. Have FUN :))"

,seedlikecrazy,2012-06-14T03:45Z,"It works. Thanks guys.

1. Mount the .iso, run setup.exe. In configure, select ""Install DirectX"", ""Install VC++"", ""Install SocialClub"". Then begin install. Installation took me 1h45min, using ADM P2 940BE.

2. Download RELOADED's update/crack, which can be found here: thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED. 

3. Update using the .exe in Update folder. 

4. Copy all the content in Crack folder to your installation folder, which is probably C:Program Files (x86)Black_BoxMax Payne 3. 

5. In crack folder there is a ""Profiles"" folder, copy that again, but now to C:Users%your user%DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club. 

6. Turn off the internet, run PlayMaxPayne3.exe.

7. Have fun."

To make space in OS Drive make sure Hibernation setting is turned of on your System on power management. Also turn off system restore function and install and use a software called CCleaner! And please use Google search for help from this topics and downloads :)

If still problem persists then please do a ""Force Recheck"" on your utorrent on maxpayne 3 download to make sure that your download is not broken!

This is what I can help! Hope your problem is solved! If not wait for some others to reply. Thanks

Apologize for bad English! "

--------------------

My graphic card is Geforce 8800 Ultra, 768 MB(DX 10).
For a smoother game, i could only use 1300x768. When i opened the game after a few days, the game's appearance is like it is running in very low graphics but the settings are 'very high' in all options & with the high resolution of 1600x1200. Previously the game used to compare the graphics limit with ~384 MB(not sure) but now the number changed to 768 MB. I somewhere read that sometimes the Max Payne 3 misrepresents the Vram. Does anyone have the same problem ?

p.s: I am trying to dload a patch from rockstar and will you let you know.."

,dreameryo,2012-07-18T07:15Z,"Worked out of the box for me. I just followed the steps mentioned by the uploader except that for me, the game started with playmaxpayne3.exe & not maxpayne3.exe. I had to launch the game after disconnecting my internet, & disabling my firewall. For people still having problems, they can start the game after adding -safemode to the target path in the shortcut, & change the settings after the game starts.

But I'm having a problem too. After the first cutscene finishes, & I have control of Max - the screen is sort of smoky and too white. I can shoot n move but can't see as half of Max's FOV is too white n the other half is grainy. If neone else has the same problem, plz do let me know the solution if u have it.

""It works. Thanks guys.

1. Mount the .iso, run setup.exe. In configure, select ""Install DirectX"", ""Install VC++"", ""Install SocialClub"". Then begin install. Installation took me 1h45min, using ADM P2 940BE.

2. Download RELOADED's update/crack, which can be found here: thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED. 

3. Update using the .exe in Update folder. 

4. Copy all the content in Crack folder to your installation folder, which is probably C:Program Files (x86)Black_BoxMax Payne 3. 

5. In crack folder there is a ""Profiles"" folder, copy that again, but now to C:Users%your user%DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club. 

6. Turn off the internet, run PlayMaxPayne3.exe.

7. Have fun."""
