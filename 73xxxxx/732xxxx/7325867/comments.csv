[V],neon,2012-06-04T02:54Z,no subs avaliable
,redguard321,2012-06-04T04:20Z,has there been any reviews on it?  No rating on imdb
,NakanoSan,2012-06-04T09:10Z,"You'd think that being made by a Japanese director + being shown in Japan first + having a theme song made by a Japanese artist, we would get a version that had Japanese audio.

But alas, I'll probably just buy this."

,aradiel,2012-06-05T15:32Z,"It's the English dub version, as mentioned in the description. Personally, I thought the dub was incredibly well acted and suited the movie perfectly. Of course if you're not a fan of dubs, you can seek out the original elsewhere.

A/V are both solid. The visuals are an interesting style. Some of it is gorgeous, other parts looks a little off to me, but that's not the rip, it's the way the movie was made.

Anyway, thoroughly enjoyable movie. Strong characters, plot and action. Great visuals. Well worth the download."
,Fritz.,2012-06-06T03:46Z,a video game cartoon...  no thanks.
,dlight430,2012-06-06T15:43Z,@BoxcarWillie The giant picture of the anime character on the front of the cover wasn't a hint?
,minastirith,2012-06-06T16:50Z,"torrent is great quality thank you.
but seriously, this is one of the worst animes ive ever seen. if you can call it an anime. "
,aradiel,2012-06-07T08:16Z,It's pseudo 3D CGI. I wouldn't call it anime. Some of it looks amazing and other parts look a bit off.
,ust2,2012-06-08T19:38Z," Oh nice I wasn't aware they were making a movie, as far as I knew it was just supposed to be a series.

 Or is that what this is, the series combined into one and being sold as a ""movie"" lol."
,senssuiy,2012-06-12T01:44Z,great movie man thanks...
