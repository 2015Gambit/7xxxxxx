,maxikd,2012-06-05T00:35Z,"what's the ""uncensored"" part? thanks"
,vielen,2012-06-05T13:14Z,"I don't always tell people to seed, but when I do, it's because I will. "
,BreezeTDK,2012-06-05T17:59Z,"Thanks, but this is not 5.1 channels.  A complete waste of time due to incorrect description."
,themagni,2012-06-06T04:50Z,"You serious, Breeze?  Poe's Law...

Thanks for the seed, I really appreciate your time, Dibya."

You serious, Breeze? Poe's Law...

Why would I kid?  Are you getting 5.1 channel surround sound from these files?  The description states Audio : AC3 5.1 Ch 384 kbps, but I am only getting 2 channels.  I happen to enjoy surround sound so when I have to delete a file that I just waited a day to download then I consider that a complete waste of time."
,BreezeTDK,2012-06-12T23:09Z,"My apologies.  When watching the show it does play in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound.  When you first start playing it, it shows 2 channel but switches to 5.1.  Who knows?  Anyway, excellent audio & video quality.  Download it."
,Limpkit2011,2012-06-15T09:54Z,there is an uncensored part? what if the Season is filled with uncensored parts? is there any ?

This pirate got the ""We have received a DMCA file sharing complaint"" notice for this torrent...  My bad - didn't have my Peer Block on..."
,aonana,2012-07-01T12:36Z,"I found the audio in S02E06 to be out of sync (VLC 2.0.1).

The 'uncesored' part refers to rips from HBO Canada, which censors words."
,LAT7A,2012-07-29T05:49Z,"I live in, and watched the HBO Canada broadcast... and there was never any censoring... so the meaning of 'Uncensored' still looms... "
