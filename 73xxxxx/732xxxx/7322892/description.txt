After warring for a century, Earth's greatest champions and villains suddenly disappear, leaving the planet devastated. Like a rapture, the Powers are gone and humanity is left behind to pick up the pieces. Amongst this wreckage, two lovers, Evelyn and Gil, find themselves separated by a continent and will do anything to find each other again. But when a strange being named "The Word" turns Evelyn into a champion with an angelic spear, she finds the force of her love for Gil clashing with her newfound power. Love and destiny collide in what will become the worst breakup-ever.

Everyone's been through a really bad breakup before, but what if yours happened right before the apocalypse? This is the scenario of The Rapture, a six issue miniseries by Michael Oeming and Taki Soma (You'll Never Die). The story is simple: boy (Gil) meets girl (Evelyn), boy loses girl, super-powered beings called Champions destroy civilization, girl gets super powers and tries to reunite with boy. While fending off cannibals.
