,cinemaniac905,2012-06-04T20:36Z,just to clarify...is everything in here twice? once as seperated eps (75-88mb) and once as all eps in one file (379mb)?
[V],psspss,2012-06-05T01:08Z,"yes they released each 11min episode as they 
went along each week and also at the end an
all collection which
reduces the annoyance
of ad credit promos

so its the full collection from
website

also year is 2011 not 2012

one gets tired ripping and uploading
til 4am :) so mistakes happen"
