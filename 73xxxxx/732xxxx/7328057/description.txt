Science Fiction Web Series RCVR From Machinima

The first episode of the show has a good hook, one you might have seen before, but perhaps not in a web series. RCVRs are people who have been communicated to by aliens, possessing knowledge about things like complex math that they did not before. We follow a "RCVR-hunter" played by Daniel Bonjour, a character that seems very intent on finding "the truth," which may be extremely familiar to those of you who remember Fox Mulder. However, he has a bit of skepticism to him, he's not ready to believe every story, so he's a bit Dana Scully, too.
