7th Season (1981-82) -- Also with comedian / juggler Michael Davis,
a frequent guest on SNL in the early 1980s. 

This Christmas show was from the only season in these 37 years 
without Don Pardo, whom Dick Ebersol fired for messing up one of 
his lines. He was replaced during that time as announcer by Mel Brandt.

Ebersol realized his mistake and re-hired Pardo by the start of the 8th Season.
