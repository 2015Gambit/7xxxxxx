,unknown2all,2012-06-03T22:22Z,im downloading it right now i liked the series even the second half. saw the game once but wasnt able to buy it i hope its good.
,unknown2all,2012-06-03T23:30Z,ok game is complete shit.
,Vulcan219,2012-06-04T01:18Z,"The game never got to get finished completely, as I said it doen't have the complete graphics as people are used to, and is tricky to figure out, and the tutorial is in need of improvement, but once you figure the things out for the game it is fun to play, though it is simple for a game, I usually play EVE Online, but from time to time, this game is a good relief from the EVE game and the people who made this game never has charged for it. So, what can you expect for a free game, which was still being developed at the time it was made, what I am trying to do is get the developers to get back to the game and finish it, and make it the way they were planning it to be."
,Vulcan219,2012-06-04T01:28Z,"@ unknown2all,

You were probably thinking about the Eureka Seven Game, made for the Playstation 2, This one is from a different group, it was still in developement when for some reason they stopped, I don't know why they stopped they were constantly improving the game play and graphics, you should have seen it before these improvements, this version was from a few years ago. And it is the last and only one you can get now, and it is free. Even from their site it is free. I and others are trying to get them to renew intrest in finish the game and get it to where it should be at. That is all we are trying to do. Because we are fans of the series as well. And we are trying to get others to support the cause that are fans."
