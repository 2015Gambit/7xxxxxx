Here is a game based on the Eureka Seven TV series, it was made a few years ago by a group of guys getting into the game business, they have stopped working on the game for a while now and if you download this game it would be greatly appreciated if you go to their sites listed below and visit their forums and give them input on the game and see if we can get it back into production and or get another version out. It isn't super high graphics but a fun game to play once you get the hang of it. It also makes a game server for you and others you know that has the game installed to be able to play on together online as well.
