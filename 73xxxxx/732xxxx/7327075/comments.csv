[V],HiGH-RG,2012-06-07T02:15Z,"@vansnick
there should be non hardcoded subs, try remove the .srt file from the folder"

,kriscity72,2012-07-17T08:57Z,My daughters best friend is deaf..I for one very much appreciate the movies spoken in English that include English subtitles..and Thank you for the upload :)
,bobbysocks313,2012-07-20T16:32Z,"Thanks for the subtitles. I'm not def., but it is difficult to hear what say all the time. Hardcoded subtitles makes it easier."

,hed_pe11,2012-09-03T00:30Z,this is the best copy i have found!! the sound is great...........its loud enough to hear without turning my speakers into rice crispies. (snap crackle and pop) the picture is great and not grainy. so far it plays fine on my ps3 without copyright warnings.
