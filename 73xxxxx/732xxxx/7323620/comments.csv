good visuals
sound is a bit iffy in places - drops to mono, occasional papery scraping sound"
,Skram0,2012-06-07T06:02Z,What's up with 24.000 fps? What happened to 23.976? Won't there be some sort of judder converting from Blu-ray 23.976 to 24.000?
,scurvypirate1234,2012-06-24T19:57Z,"Sound isn't just iffy, it's awful. Static in multiple places, and the audio track after 30:00 is off by about 200ms."
