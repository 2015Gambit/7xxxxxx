I'm glad this brilliant woman is here for us

And you too 480v"
[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-04T06:11Z,"480v was gone for weeks, so I subscribed 
to Randi Rhodes' show to catch up on what I missed from the torrents... and also The Ed Schultz Show too."

Have you considered uploading the source files you now have access to? It would be a tremendous help for not only me, but for anyone who otherwise cannot get these shows unless someone shares on p2p. 

For example, the best I can upload for Randi's June 4th show is hours 2 and 3 only. I still have to scan through the audio and remove all commercials before I upload. Your files are already commercial free, aren't they? Please...I can really use the help."
[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-05T08:08Z,"Yes,  480v -- My Randi Rhodes podcast files are commercial-free. Plus they don't have the annoying bumper music normally heard in between segments too.  Only my priority now is uploading classic 1980s episodes of Saturday Night Live.

Also I plan to soon cancel my Randi Rhodes subscription to save $6 a month, since I'm now paying that for The Ed Schultz Show.   I'll probably upload Ed's radio show instead.....once I run out of SNL episodes later this month."

Can you at least upload yesterday's (June 4) Randi show?  I don't have the complete show."
[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-06T18:54Z,I uploaded the June 4 show last night. Hope you got it.
