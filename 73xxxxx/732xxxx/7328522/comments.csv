,antinames,2012-08-08T22:29Z,128kbps for all the songs I checked. Don't lie.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-09T16:51Z,"@above: You're right, some of the tracks have bitrate 128kbps and 192kbps. Before uploading, I checked the  bitrate on only a single track and it was 320 so I assumed it was the same for all of them. Didn't really mean to lie to or mislead anyone. Still, they're all in acceptably-good quality."
