This is my first upload, after using PB for years I thought it was due time to try and give back, like i said this is my first attempt at doing an up so forgive me if its missing something or it didn't work, this is why I am starting out with a small but pretty cool app. If it works out ok? (it's a rar file) I have a ton of paid iPhone apps I know everyone will love.

 just download IfunBox the latest version makes it super simple to install cracked apps, AS LONG AS YOUR "JAILBROKEN" AGAIN MUST BE JAILBROKE TO INSTALL THESES APPS

This app will let you install/run any of the font files from cydia, 

a lot of themes have font pack. included in their download but you'll need this app to make the changes

well, hope it works out... and if not maybe someone will direct me or let me know the process of making a easy up, that makes it easy for everyone to download without trouble.
 in the meantime I'll be looking for the right way
