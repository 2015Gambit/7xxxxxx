,relicek,2012-06-04T01:00Z,"I will tell how you will rid of BSOD in crack directory or blackbox version and how to proper install RELOADED version with all updates with no errors or problems. I had problems from friday with this and i solved it now and no problems at all now.

1. Have Windows 7 with SP1, you need SP1 and you will no longer get BSOD for 100%. I had problems with BSOD with reloaded version, even cant opened crack folder on DVD4 and i got BSOD. After i reinstall my old version of windows 7 to newer with SP1 the problem was solved.

2. Install game

3. When installation is finished cancel auto updates when autoupdate window appeared.

4. Open DVD4, Crack folder, Updates and install all 3 exes.

5. Copy dlc folder, binkw32.dll,gsrld.dll and MaxPayne3.exe to your max payne installed folder and rewrite all when asked.

6. Press windows key + R, write wf.msc to command line.  On windows firewall window left up is outbound rules, click on it, then on right click on 'new rule'. Select Program, next, browse for maxpayne3.exe, block the connection, next all check (domain, private, publi), next, name it example: maxpayne.exe and click finish. Make this same for Playmaxpayne3.exe. Now you exes are blocked from connecting to internet.

7. Start PlayMaxPayne3.exe. Click Offline mode. When it starts game (maybe some problems with clicking resolution but it will be fixed in few seconds) just press alt+tab, go to your user documents folder/rockstargames/socialclub/ and here copy from DVD4/crack/profiles folder.

8. Go back to game, press HOME, Sign in, and you will see one account on left, just click on it and you will be logged for your offline mode game without any problems and all game progress will be saved properly.

9. Enjoy game and buy it later as i will do it :)"
