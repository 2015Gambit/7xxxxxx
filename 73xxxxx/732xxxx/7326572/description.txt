     Three on a Match covers approximately 13 years in the lives of girlhood 
     chums Mary Keaton (Joan Blondell), Ruth Wescott (Bette Davis) and Vivian
     Deverse(Ann Dvorak). Having graduated from grammar school together in 1919,
     the girls stage a reunion ten years later. Hard-boiled Mary is now a chorus 
     girl,level-headed Ruth has a steady job as a secretary, and vixenish Vivian
     is on the verge of capriciously deserting her wealthy husband Robert Kirkwood 
     (Warren William) and their baby in favor of sexy mob-boss Mike (Lyle Talbot). 
     Several more years pass, during which Mary marries Henry, Ruth is hired as 
     governess for Henry, and Vivian's son and a drug-addicted Vivian become
     fatally enmeshed in a kidnapping plot involving her own child. In his second
     Warner Brothers film , tenth-billed Humphrey Bogart essays his first sneering-
     gangster role. Three on a Match was remade (and considerably laundered) in 
     1938 as Broadway Musketeers.
