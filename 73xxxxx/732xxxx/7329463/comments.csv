I want to add ""The Garden"" is a beautiful song."
,Smoke_,2012-06-06T00:48Z,Oh yes! Finally. Thank you for the up!

,tails04,2012-06-10T06:50Z,"Mwuahahaha... Actually sitting with the copy of the C.D in my hands right now... Came in last week!.. Special Edition True Rush Fan package... Few posters, and books bout the meanings of ALL of the rush songs.. ect..

Aha My stepmom ordered it for my dad.. and i Punked it.. i had no idea you could even order a precopy.. im so jealous that I had to take it.. We fight over who the biggest Rush fan is each day.. Lol Then Again I was named after Alex.. lol And the other name choice was Neil because my Mother didn't wanna name me Geddy. lol...  Anyways the funny part is.. Me and Him are the ginormous Rush fans.. and when you order the Fan package precopies.. theres a Rush poster with the names of all the people who got the Limited orders.. lol And because she had to sent to her (and noone knew it was gonna be there) they put her name on the poster! lol So shes righttt jealous! lol Anyways... Siccck C.D!  Gotta download the Mp3 for my car now tho.. To lazy to convert it to my comp! =) ENJOY EVERYONE.. I know i love it!"
,tails04,2012-06-10T06:53Z,"Oh and as for people being Dissapointed in the Music.. as I'm sure of ton of people are gonna come on here and say that.. Start from the First Song. First C.D Rush eveery put out.. and go throughout the years.. They have never not progressed thier music to different styles and heights.. The words ""I want the old rush back"" would never even make sense considering their styles changed so often. =) Xanadu is still and will always be my fav. Rush song tho!"
