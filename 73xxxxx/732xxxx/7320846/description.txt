To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesnt play the video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player does.
 
I'm finally home from the hospital after having had a complicated surgical spinal fusion operation involving my cervical spine due to nerve damage that has caused 75% paralysis in my left arm and hand. Please pray for me to have a sucessful recovery from this operation if you can and even though I am in a lot of pain right now I am glad to be home in time to capture and upload the WWE Friday Night Smackdown tonight 06-01-2012. Thanks wrestling fans.

Please leave a comment below if you wish to do so. Enjoy the show!!!
