Salomão Borges Filho, better known as Lô Borges, is also at the core of the Corner Club musical production movement, which began in Belo Horizonte in the early 1960's. Together with Milton Nascimento and a massive participation of other members of the Club, Lô released what would be one of the most important, representative and significative albums in the musical history of Brazil. His solo carreer has many great moments and its full of amazing compositions as he keeps seeding his "sentimento mineiro" in the four corners of the world. To listening to the music of Lô Borges is to experience a way of seeing the world that only exists through the eyes of the people of Minas Gerais.
