iNFO
One thing we found stupid with this R5 was that it didnt have any english
subtitles but they manged to add english audio fucking russians are retarded
also we went with the name most people know this movie by and is on the menu http://i.imgur.com/K09xA.jpg
if you need subs for spanish/mexico parts just look on google tho there only short for 3seconds

NOTES
