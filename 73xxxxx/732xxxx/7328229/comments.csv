Yes people are downloading and giving nothing back if you are reading this and you're 1 of those people who do that,
Please change for the benefit of others and share at least a 1-1 ratio for goodness sake.
Thanks again to boobsman and everyone else who makes this possible."

Thanks in advance"
,mrnexus,2012-06-07T18:35Z,"look at the tutorials on teamxcuter.com
and also utube look for flashing a xbox360 slim with Lt3.0.
note the xbox elites and arcades are easy to do imo ive never flashed a slim but i do know how it done its not hard if you have the hardware,u will need to know what drive you have inside your slim etc good luck."
,Vdx,2012-06-07T19:18Z,"Thanks boobsman!
I'm using SmartTrack DVD9 to burn. They are 2 times cheaper than verbatim - $1,5 here (verbatim is $3). Their code is CMC MAG-D03-64. For them to work i use liteone dvd writer flashed to support XGD3 writes and also changed write speed in firmware from minimum 4x to 2,4x. On 2,4x all burns are 100% ok."
