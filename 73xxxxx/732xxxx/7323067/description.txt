An increasingly important feature across the technical textile industry is to produce textiles faster and to have more effective new product development (NPD).

This book not only provides a fascinating overview of how products are launched, but is also a source of practical guidance for developing textile products successfully. Part one provides a general overview of innovation and textile product development that introduces the principles of developing and defining new products. Part two goes on to discuss a collection of international studies from across the textile industry. Chapters describe actual new product development projects, identifying the problems that were faced and what can be learned from these projects, such as customer co-creation and methods for reducing the risk in NPD. Topics range from technical textiles and apparel to the end uses of textiles used within the automotive and packaging industries.
