Dungeon Defenders is a hybrid game combining aspects from both Action Role Playing and Tower Defense genres. Players can choose from many hero classes, each with their own defenses, as they defend Eternia Crystals from hordes of creatures. Besides building static defenses, players can fight with a massive arsenal of weapons and familiars.
