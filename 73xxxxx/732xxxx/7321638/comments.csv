,DjVetuik,2012-06-03T02:08Z,"Does this work with multiplayer? Because when I try, it says there are no games. Is this not the right version, or what?"
,DjVetuik,2012-06-03T02:15Z,"When it's possible, could you upload 7.36b to 7.36c? I know you said you wouldn't, but playing single player is boring..."
,7dn.43fn,2012-06-03T12:22Z,"first of all: thanks for all your work with this game and it's almost daily updates.

i have a suggestion: instead of creating, uploading and seeding many incremental updates and one big major client torrent every major patch why not just seed a constantly updated torrent of the uncompressed game folder? thus everyone just has to point your current torrent to his/her game folder, the torrent client would compare which files/parts are unchanged and would only have to download the few files that changed with the update (meaning that YOU don't need to filter that for every update you publish). the best thing is, it would work with every version of the client, no matter if someone wants to upgrade from 7.29c or 7.36 to e.g. this current 7.36b. and if someone suspects that a system crash or malicious software altered his/her game he/she could even use your torrent as a file verification system, similar to what steam provides.

it would mean less work for you, less torrents to maintain, less data that has to be seeded and for us it would mean easier updating. and you wouldn't have to worry about the stability of all those incremental updates installed on top of each other, because if the master installation that you prepare for the torrent works, then everyones will work, too."
,hwangtinglee,2012-06-03T16:24Z,"Another great update, thanks for the hard work you put in. One question, since you will be uploading the major patch as full client, will you still upload the rest of the patches individually (i.e. patch 7.36c, etc) separately?"
,jazdevi,2012-06-03T18:36Z,"@7dn.43fn

The torrent would replace your save files. If you counter that, kompas would need to have 2 installations of this game at all times."
,7dn.43fn,2012-06-03T20:48Z,"@jazdevi

you just take out the few save and config files temporarily before creating the torrent, after torrent file creation put it back, seed the torrent and play the game simultaneously. thus the torrent client won't touch these files ever, not on kompas909s hdd, not on your hdd. as simple as that"
,jazdevi,2012-06-03T21:31Z,"@7dn.43fn 

That's true. But I still can't shake the feeling that there could be some problems.

*Still waiting for the latest update* :)"
,7dn.43fn,2012-06-03T22:34Z,"@jazdevi

it's technlogy and has nothing to do with shaken or stirred feelings :P to create torrents like i described is one of the great features of the bittorrent system, and it should be used where applicable to save uploaders, seeders and peers both work and time as well as bandwidth/space. i mean in the end that's what bittorrrent is about: to be the most powerful and efficient method of file distribution.

but it's ofc kompas909s decision, he publishes the updates and he might see some problems with my suggestion that i'm unable to see. so, for now, let's just get back to playing the damn game until the next update is out :)"
,kompas909,2012-06-03T22:44Z,"1# I like that idea, but well, ther's a times, when crack are bugged, and you can't play 100%, well right now you allways can roolback by 1 patch, and thats isn't a big problem. But yes, I'll consider that Idea.

2# I'll uplaod all patches that will come out.

3# Next patch... dunno, I'll upload it today or maybe tomorow."
,7dn.43fn,2012-06-03T23:48Z,regarding #3: do you plan to upload a cracked 7.36c update as official update 7.36d is already confirmed for a tomorrow release?
,kompas909,2012-06-04T00:23Z,"well, dunno, you see, when i got 7.36b, after like 1-2h, i got 7.36c to, so i doubted to uplaod it, and skip to 7.36d, so I realy don't know if ther is a point to upload 7.36c anymore :/"
,mrtz1,2012-06-04T02:33Z,Thank you for all of your uploads kompas909!! :) I love your work!
,senfiron,2012-06-04T11:51Z,"kompas909, if it possible, plese upload all updates, even smallest, as soon as you can. We will download them all and send to you rays of happiness!)"
,7dn.43fn,2012-06-04T12:11Z,"well, i wouldn't mind waiting for 7.36d. just skip 7.36c if you want, kompas909"
