There was a brief period in the late 1980s when eastern European music seemed to be flavour of the month among the UK's burgeoning world music fraternity. Groups such as Muzsikás and The Trio Bulgarka performed here and had albums released on British labels. Vujicsics were also part of this mini explosion of interest and Hannibal Records put out this album having licensed the recordings from the legendary Hungaroton label.

Vujicsics are an interesting band. Named after the composer and musicologist Tihamer Vujicsics they share his passionate interest in the folk music of the ethnic minorities of southern Hungary. So this is a Hungarian band who are perhaps best known for playing Serbian or Croatian folk music. In the case of this album it is the former musical tradition that provides the material. The six band members play a wide range of stringed and woodwind instruments and are joined by four female singers including Márta Sebestyén.
