,alphamale007,2012-06-30T17:18Z,"@gonzosam
Yes it is a reg file mate. Just install anydvd then double click on the file and all is good. Thanks for the up mrriser007. Nice and clean."
,Darth_Adversor,2012-07-05T01:00Z,"This worked like a boss, thanks very much uploader.  I tried Chattchitto's and Thumper's uploads of 7.0.4.0, but kept getting an error message and it wouldn't read my Blu-Ray.  Let's hope Slysoft doesn't block this version too..."
,cycowolf,2012-07-10T21:57Z,Worked perfectly. Thanks for the up.

,enchanted41,2012-08-04T00:00Z,"I'm new to pirate. I downloaded and installed this torrent but when I try to open, a message pops up that says, ""This version is not licensed. Please install a valid license key. And it gives a name and a seial number and ""free updates until 5/20/12."" And then two button that say ""order"" and ""exit."" I clicked on the file that has the sentry key but the message still pops up.

Any help to get this program working?

Also, how do I pm another user?"
,Darth_Adversor,2012-08-18T22:41Z,"This worked for me initially, but what enchanted reported is now happening for me, too.  Have to find another release, I guess."
