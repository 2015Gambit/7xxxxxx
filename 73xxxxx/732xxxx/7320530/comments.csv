,sanjsingh,2012-07-18T07:17Z,what are the system requirements for this?
,killski94,2012-07-30T23:52Z,CloudSaki did you figure out what to do when it ask to insert the disk?
,apdj94,2012-07-31T02:45Z,Hey that password didnt seem to work for me and the site that the guy provided keeps getting blocked by norton
,apdj94,2012-07-31T03:26Z,OK I figured out the password thing but I am now getting a message that tells me to insert disk 1. The only file i have been able to succesfully mount was the original iso in the download file. Is there another one that I am missing that needs to be mounted to the drive?
,Scoobyxx1,2012-08-10T02:31Z,"To install all you have to do is mount the .iso, and instead of double clicking on the CD drive that you mounted the .iso to, right click it and hit explore, from there you extract the .rar file that is password protected ( the password is "" qwe "" ) after extracting go to the folder you extracted to and run the setup, after the install is done and you used the product key provided, go to the crack folder and drag that .exe file into the main AoE3 directory and you should be good."
,bad_language,2012-08-13T11:58Z,I have installed and dragged the .exe crack to the file. when i try start AOE my pc says i have a compatibility problem and if i try bypass the warning it asks me to insert disc one. can someone please help... am i dragging the .exe file to the wrong folder or something???
,bad_language,2012-08-13T11:59Z,"just to add to my previous post, i am running windows 7"
,ProSkillz,2012-08-19T23:01Z,"@bad_language
The Crack file needs to be copied over into C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft GamesAge of Empires III

Hope this helps"
,apprature,2012-08-26T23:16Z,when i extract the .rar file it is saying i must have a disc with the following volume: C:UsersAppDataLocalTemp7zOD3BE.tmpAOE3.r00  and it won't let me continue extraction. this is my first time so sorry if its a dumb question lol
,apprature,2012-08-27T01:37Z,ahh ha!! figured it out!!! :D
,WillhelmTell,2012-08-28T01:03Z,"Thank you for your comments guys, this helped me out.. Only one thing: Multiplayer doesn't work. It says ""ESO doesn't work with your game version"""
