The Addams step out of Charles Addams' cartoons. They live with
all of the trappings of the macabre (including a detached hand
for a servant) and are quite wealthy. Added to this mix is a
crooked accountant and his loan shark and a plot to slip in the
shark's son into the family as their long lost Uncle Fester.
Can the false Fester find his way into the vault before he is
discovered?

On any day of the week, you could expect a newborn baby to
be nurtured and loved by his older sister. Except, of course,
if it's Wednesday. Pubert is the latest addition to the Addams
family and, to prevent sibling rivalry escalating to fratricide,
Wednesday and Pugsley are shipped off to summer camp and a nanny
is hired. Debby Jellinsky is great with wrinkling baldies, which
makes her the perfect nanny for Pubert and the unlikely wife of
Uncle Fester.
The question is..."Is she grave-digging or gold-digging?"
