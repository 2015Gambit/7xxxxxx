,AliasBFX,2012-06-03T07:19Z,"@cptncptn, I could not agree more with you, I dont understand why is people releasing at 30 or 60 fps with shitty frame blending that screw the whole experience out and in some cases with really low file sizes I can't imagine how bad those releases may look like."
,Kknewkles,2012-06-03T10:12Z,"I agree with two guys above.
And heck, PublicHD, already being the best Korra supplier, tremendoucly stepped up the quality - that's just sooo sweet.

We love you guys, every Sunday you make us genuinely happy with your releases."

Best from the worst and mostly because of file size. Until it's not Hi10P (more known as ""10 bits""), it's just ""make it bigger so it's not look as _total_ crap"". Seriously, people, it's 2012 already, why you still watching those god-awful banded gradients and colors?"
