Information
------------------------------

With shaggy hair and a husky voice, the founder of Montreal's Insectarium exclaims, to anyone who will listen: "Let's face it; insects are the most useful animals, both to nature and to mankind... I just want to reconcile humans with this class that has a lot of class - insects !".



Georges Brossard is the creator and mastermind of the INSECTIA series. His enthusiasm is infectious, his anecdotes are fascinating, his explanations are captivating, and his parallels between the worlds of man and insects are daring. Brossard's approach is straightforward, and his vision, wide-ranging. This great communicator tackles the subject of entomology with a passion nurtured by twenty years of research, on-site expeditions, and lobbying to overcome the seemingly insurmountable barrier which exists between people and the natural sciences. To Georges Brossard, the world of insects is not merely a reason for living but life itself. A celebration of life on this planet - that is the essence of INSECTIA.
