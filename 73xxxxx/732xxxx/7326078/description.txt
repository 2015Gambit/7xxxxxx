Seriously good documentary on the Punk Rock scene in 1970's Britain.

Episode 1 of 3 (1972-1976)

Including extremely rare footage and interviews with some of the lesser known as well as the main players 

A fascinating insight into how and why this cultural movement happened - why the hell has there been nothing like it since...

35 years on - lolwat...

Please seed 

Thanx
