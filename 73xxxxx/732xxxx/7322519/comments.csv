,coleTech,2012-06-02T18:39Z,Thanks so much for getting this up so fast. I had my dvr set to record and it didn't record :(
,Dark_Luigii,2012-06-02T18:43Z,Is it legit?
,mm_kay,2012-06-02T19:14Z,"If it's like the last one then it's VERY low quality and a lot of people had issues with the audio codec but I know he was working on that.

Personally I'm waiting for an HD upload, I'd only recommend this if you're looking for the smallest file size.  "
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-02T19:20Z,"yes this is legit....we'd never upload fake. we even have the trusted skull.

it's tvrip so it's not SD that's all"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-02T19:21Z,"*not hd. this is SD

also yes I think I fixed the audio issue codec thing. nobody has mentioned the issue since I tried something new so I think it's gone."
,williamvirkis,2012-06-02T19:39Z,Quality? bit rate? anyone? :) Thanks for the upload anyway

,williamvirkis,2012-06-02T19:59Z,"Quality is more than enough, looks and sounds well, (it is not hd or close).

The only big problem I find is that the screen was cut to ""fit"" in a rectangular aspect ratio, it means that the black bars ate a piece of screen and everything looks closer than it really is, like if the screen were zoomed."
,OkLetsTryAgain,2012-06-02T20:01Z,"Thanks MrUnpopular. I've been waiting for hours for it to complete. (Actually, it just finnished - right now!) Can't wait to watch it.

The show airs Sturdays, @ 10 c, right?
"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-02T20:19Z,"@williamvirkis we cut the black rectangular bars off each end since it's SD. goes from square to more of a rectangle because of that.

@OkLetsTryAgain  that is correct"
