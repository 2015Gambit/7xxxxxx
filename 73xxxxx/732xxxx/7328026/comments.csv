,malger,2012-06-05T18:18Z,I get audio but no video on some software but Windows Media Player doesn't open it at all.
,bwheat,2012-06-06T13:18Z,"Same here. MPC crashes, Winamp has audio but no video, integrated utorrent player (just to test) has stuttering video but no audio.
All other MP4 play just fine."
,bwheat,2012-06-06T14:51Z,"Updated to the latest version of Winamp, still the same, audio no video. Added MP4 extension to the DirectShow list, now I get the picture of the first frame, no more audio but the timer is running."
