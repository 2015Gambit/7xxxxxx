,scooterboobie,2012-06-03T20:52Z,"What is up with Paul Senior? Most of the time he is just talking to hear him self speak. Glad IÂ´m not his son!
Thanks for uploading :)"
[V],psspss,2012-06-04T17:02Z,"i think years of booze abuse has damaged his brain to do with comprehending english and facts

his son would say something and its like he hears
something totally different.. I got what Jr was saying in the first 10min of the meeting LOL

I think he needed to write down a list for him :)
and perhaps cut and paste together with date stamps of hin abusing him on air even after the settlement

but I agree hes settled down alot from all the 2 years ordeal right?"
,NOKES,2012-06-06T13:34Z,"Its obvious in the 1st 2mins of this conversation that JR said he wanted a professional relationship. Where as they act like professionals and not the screaming ninny that Senior normally acts like. My favorite part is how Senior is always saying how they need to move forward yet he wont give at all in anyway. Basically its going to have to be JR. giving in to Senior's demands and falling back into their old patterns. Senior hasnt changed at all he has done nothing but talk shit about his son from day one and did everything in his power to make everyone think his son is this complete looser. What kind of a parent degrades his own child like that? It just shows who the child really is in this relationship, JR quit his business, SR got his pussy hurt so he needed to prove to the whole world that the only reason they parted ways is because he son is at fault and in no way was it because of SR or any of his actions. Where if you look back at the highlights it is nothing but SR throwing tantrums sitting around with his feet up on his desk and telling JR he is lazy and doesnt work. I give credit to JR for how he handle the whole fight from start to finish he took the high road didnt take part in any of the mud sliging and left that to his dad to make a fool of himself. SR should count himself lucky as hell, cuz if I was JR I would have knock SR flat the fuck out every time he opened his mouth about me. Which would have led to me starting out each day going over to OCC and knocking my dad flat on his ass until he either learned to keep his mouth shut or it got wired shut from being broken in 3 places. SR even has the nerve to say it was JR talking smack the whole time and he has been innocent and the victim the whole time. I honestly wish I could reach thru my TV and ring SR's bell, he's basically a bully and bullys only respond to being the one whos being bullied."

Just stop doing it if you don't provide HDTV , cause i did not buy my HDTV for this ancient quality standard, this shit needs to die already and sorry for complaining but you know ... it's we the HD guys that always get screwed."
,stewox,2012-06-15T11:39Z,rather upload the extra stuff that doesn't get released by scenes ...
