Documentary which records and celebrates the life and works of 'punk poet' John Cooper Clarke, 
looking at his life as a poet, a comedian, a recording artist and revealing how he has remained 
a significant influence on contemporary culture over four decades.

With a bevy of household names from stand-up comedy, lyricists, rock stars and cultural 
commentators paying homage to him, the film reveals Salford-born Cooper Clarke as a dynamic force 
who remains as relevant today as ever, as successive generations cite him as an influence on their 
lives, careers and styles.

From Bill Bailey to Plan B, Steve Coogan to Kate Nash and Arctic Monkeys front man Alex Turner 
to cultural commentators such as Miranda Sawyer and Paul Morley, the film reveals the life behind 
one of Britain's sharpest and most witty poets - a national treasure.

For the past four Sundays, John Cooper Clarke has been warming up the Punk Britannia season with 
a weekly show on BBC 6 Music. Punk Britannia is a season of specialised programming across BBC Four 
and BBC Radio 6 Music marking 35 years since punk's heyday in 1977, which exploded across the 
country during the Queen's Silver Jubilee.
