Jaimen M. by now

I wonder if they fo HD cameras now with better zoom and still getting better videos?
at least he now can get some framing in it
and know what critics claim atleast"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-06-03T10:58Z,its easy to see why people would call fake on this guy.the odds of one person catching a ufo on cam are very low.the odds on that person catching that many differant ufo's on cam are just crazy....C-3PO couldnt come up with those odds
[V],psspss,2012-06-03T15:32Z,"but he saw them as a 5 year old kid and throughout his life..

perhaps somehow they connected with him
perhaps hes an abductee and didnt know it lol

but its like if hes looking for them they show up
and when someone is invite to see them they take off quick.. like his father..

although in the end bit his girlfirend and brother and other mates now join in and confirm they see them too..

but really.. a skeptic or tele crew need to go along like Jaime and capture it with him

then its proven without doubt"

ONE OF THE WORST ATTEMPTED FRAUDS EVER

IF YOU BELIEVE THIS SHIT....YOU ARE FUCKING IDIOT...STRAIGHT UP."
,cinemaniac905,2012-06-03T15:44Z,why would anyone need to investigate an absolute (and very clear) fraud? not worth the time or resources. seriously...grow a fucking brain psspss
,cinemaniac905,2012-06-03T15:46Z,"jaime  maussan is a proven fraud ...time and time again, seriously get a clue...it's morons like this (and you?) that ruins the real ufologist cases for everyone"
[V],psspss,2012-06-03T18:22Z,"nob you didnt watch the docu did you

your see the experts couldnt see fraud

its faked?"

[V],psspss,2012-06-04T02:09Z,"and thats a creditable source of info that web link 

this video they clearer stated why he wasnt faking

1) He didnt want fame or want money for any
of the videoz 

but now you web link is claiming opposite

2) hes parents confirm since he was a kid that
he saw stuff in the sky even before they had
cameras and video recorders

3) other people with him have seen the same things and also filmed them

4) video analysis has proven the objects were big not small models and the house window frame has appeared in a few zoom outs

now thats what the docu said.. nothing to do with getting a brain.. all you can say is some other expert has found proof of the opposite

fraudsters always get caught out in time espc releasing much footage.

regardless if he is a fraud its still a good video for the collections for later reference"
[V],psspss,2012-06-04T02:27Z,"and theres many web links chat on him..
and argue fake or not. 

http://www.disclose.tv/forum/ufo-photographed-in-italy-great-detail-t61024.html

now this guy faked 1700 videos, even if that number is way off and it was 170 videos, not one witness saw him hanging something from a cable and filming the the hoax ? did you see were he lives ? houses every where, and no one seen him making the hoax ?

[V],psspss,2012-06-05T09:23Z,"theres hasnt been any reports in the creditable Openminds news channel on fraud on this one from what I can see.. only other videos from UK and Israel one
