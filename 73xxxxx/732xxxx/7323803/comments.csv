All in all it's pretty much the same as the current 1.38 GB versions, almost no noticeable loss of quality but saves you size for your download.

I hate rating cams, remember a cam rating is a rating against other Cams, not an overall rating that you'd use against DvD/BR etc.

Remember this is a Cam vs Cam rating:P 

Video 7, audio 6.  Not bad, very watchable, but very much a cam in every sense."
,tomt7898,2012-06-03T20:39Z,is this the same crappy cam as all others out there
,lunaserax,2012-06-04T08:49Z,"Watchable cam but end is ruined by the camera being tilted too much towards the bottom so all you get is chins for the final showdown.  

However, same copy as Hackulus but 1/2 the size - I downloaded that one first and it was playable but corrupt - so I recommend this one!
