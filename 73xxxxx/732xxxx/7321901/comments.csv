,wannabemixer,2012-06-02T20:15Z,the virus is in the uninstall.exe so just remove that after u have installed the software if you want to be on the safe side not sure why the maker would include a threat in the uninstall.exe 
,JPhreak,2012-06-03T01:02Z,"Lol , look at this jackass.
Going into other peoples torrents of FRAPS and saying ,
OMFG ! IT HAS A VIRUS , DOWNLOAD MY COPY.
And then on his he's like, it's okay that it says it's a virus , don't worry about it.

Class A act man , Class A. A is for Ass by the way.
Oh and yes I know that virus scans show false positives etc.
I don't even scan shit for viruses , I know how to manually remove them through registries without a lame program.."
,wannabemixer,2012-06-03T15:21Z,"@Freak you see what i did there ^^ lol anyway

yes there is a virus in the uninstall.exe but for people who just want the new fraps then this will have to do for them as there is no other fraps out
so if they just need to have the latest version than they can download this remove the uninstall.exe and enjoy oh i see you say that you can remove the viruses with out a program good for you i wont give a price but good for you ;)"
,wannabemixer,2012-06-03T15:22Z,oh and i also added in the torrent that there is a virus i dont try to hide it but i also said i think its false and there is a easy way to remove it its all up to the user if they want to download the torrent or not

,Lost_Player99,2012-06-13T16:42Z,new fraps version out..
,skulldragon,2012-06-13T22:48Z,"So I actually read the VT list and those comments here... and I also read the blog about the ""Cryptor"" virus.

First of all, the naming is wrong and should never be used to identify a virus, since, what is a ""cryptor""?
""A tool that may be used, legitimately, or illegitimately, to protect an application from being reverse-engineered, or otherwise analyzed. These tools use encryption to obfuscate the content of an application, often for the purposes of avoiding detection and hindering analysis.""

AVG most definitely couldn't find the ""Cryptor"" virus, since it's AVG and I ran Uninstall.exe in a Sandbox and in my Windows freely and didn't find any malicious activity whatsoever, so that means, AVG found a program, which is protected with encryption, which is unlikely, since it's AVG for gods sake. So it most definitely is a typical sig. database mismatch that's common for all cheap AVs that earn money from advertisement rather than from prof. protection.

You should be happy that you only encounter amateur viruses from time to time, which luckily never work.
Now if you step on a real mine, 4% chance, a real pro virus, like Zeus trojan etc, you won't make it back here to tell about it. ;)"
,ClickTPB,2012-06-17T01:29Z,Scared about all of the false positives :( And the skull commenter
,GSin0304,2012-06-18T20:22Z,yea the skull guy really is freakish. Anywayz i dont want fraps :)

,ObserverJLin,2012-06-28T18:32Z,"Why has 3.5.5 not been cracked yet?
