,nakamoto,2012-06-05T23:30Z,"Seed, you craven sons or whores!!! SEED!!!"
[V],manOtor,2012-06-06T11:42Z,"@russell1nash:

you're welcome and I am glad there are those who appreciate it ;)

But I am afraid, I'm no encoder, just a collector - I use what the scene releases and wrap it up.
So I doubt there is a ""back to XviD""..."
,macpro7,2012-06-07T06:01Z,subtitles are hardcoded or what ??
[V],manOtor,2012-06-07T22:20Z,"@macpro7:

There ain't any other subtitles than the ones when they speak Dothraki, and because this torrent consists of TVRips, yes, those are naturally hardcoded (thank god ;)!)"
,russell1nash,2012-06-07T22:31Z,"k, thanx for answering! 
and keep up the great work! "

,vampzcore,2012-06-08T21:38Z,@ elpirate8 try VLC Media Player.. :)
,melvinwaaa,2012-06-09T03:18Z,"Currently downloading.

Silly question, but does seeding use bandwidth?

:p"
,elpirate8,2012-06-09T03:58Z,"@vampzcore it won't work!! and windows media freez or fast forward!

I don't know what to do :("
[V],manOtor,2012-06-09T23:26Z,"@elpirate8:

There are a few options you have:
1. You need VLC!
2. Update your codecs to the latest version.
Google for and download the Shark codec pack. If you have a 64 bit Windows be sure to download the 64 bit version additionally! Install both, fist 32 bit version, then 64 bit version.
Now even media player should be able to play the files.
3. Your files are simply corrupted, try redownloading the torrent and files.

@melvinwaaa:
Yes ;)"
,Herr.Grun,2012-06-10T03:04Z,I HATE DIVX.. But this is the only complete with a decent number of seeds relative to leeches.. Thx uploader.
,melvinwaaa,2012-06-12T02:11Z,"@manOtor
Thanks for the silly answer to the silly question. :p

Already downloaded the first 4 episodes. A/V 10/10
Though I can't watch it on my DVD player anymore since it's in MP4 format.

Still a very good torrent. Thanks!"
,Kitsune13,2012-06-12T08:34Z,downloading at 1.3 mbps max.. nice thanks 4 great torrent :*
,thekhaleesi,2012-06-18T07:24Z,is this uncut version?
,Angus_Belrot,2012-06-19T00:37Z,"This may be a dumb question, but how exactly would I go about burning all of these to a DVD for use in a DVD player?"
,Rob93,2012-06-19T15:56Z,"Can anyone tell me if this will play, as is, on a Play Station 3? Thanks!"
[V],manOtor,2012-06-19T21:52Z,"@thekhaleesi:
I am not sure if there even is an uncut version. HBO is a private cable network, you have to subscribe to and pay, if you want to watch their program. They are not restricted by public moral standards, like the public networks (NBC,CBS,ABC,etc.) So they pretty much can show whatever they like.
However this torrent consists of the TVRips ripped from HBO. So probably (at least within standards of other countries that may air this series on public networks) this is uncut.

@Angus_Belrot:
Just google MP4 to DVD and you'll find a whole bunch of programs that convert the mp4 format to DVD and even burn it afterwards."
,mum2three,2012-06-22T07:52Z,"Seriously, how f***in hard is it to seed you selfish arseholes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,karenok,2012-06-26T09:41Z,where can i get complete season 1? tnx
,DaSqurlyOne,2012-07-07T21:54Z,"@manOtor
I love ur work.  KaBlaam IS AWESOME!!!!!!!
Quality of ur downloads is supurb.  Thank u so much for compiling as u do.  It must take a lot of time and energy. I for one will speak for all of those that don't, we LOVE U!!!!

@Angus_Belrot
ConvertXtoDVD is the best one I found.  Changes any format of file to something that the DVD player will play. If u search in the bay u will find a ""shared"" one."
,Stevenholmes1988,2012-07-08T19:29Z,"you are a legend! Nearley finished watching season 1.  It took a while to get into it, but it is getting better. recomend a watch people!"

,indianpiranha,2012-07-18T22:34Z,"Hi, 

I have been having some issues with some downloads not playing on my x box 360. Is there a way to know what files will and won't play before I DL them? This would be much appreciated!!!!"
[V],manOtor,2012-07-19T01:29Z,"@indianpiranha:
I'm afraid there is no other way than you downloading only one file first to check it out, and the rest if it works out ;).
sry.
But as the files usually are of good quality you could use a converter to make them all playable on your xbox360 without too much quality loss."
,ZoPunde,2012-08-13T07:40Z,FUCK JOFFREY!!!

,criminy_,2012-08-28T04:47Z,"Are those dimensions correct?

352 by 624 is not HDTV. :("
,YardBoy,2012-08-29T15:23Z,"+1 to the quality of the UL'ers, contributors one and all.  Repaid in kind 3.86X.  You?
V9/A9 and great swordplay. Lots of heads roll.  The ta ta's [HBO] are real and they're stupendous  ;^)"
,10dragonxx,2012-09-01T13:17Z,The reason people don't seed it because they don't want their internet sucked.

,cozymonk,2012-09-08T22:45Z,"Thanks for the upload. Good quality for the size. Disappointing that some are from HBO: Canada which is censored (for some unknown, probably retarded, reason. The network that hosted Trailer Park Boys didn't censor that show and I don't think it was even a premium network)."
,hohl,2012-09-14T09:23Z,"Thnx a ton.

A-10
V-10
M-10 
My opinion is good DVD quality should be rated 10. If it's HD or bluray then i don't know use a different rating system. i just see people get mad cause peeps say 10 when its not HD but in my opinion if it looks good and sounds good then make it easy for peeps to understand. Also VLC didn't seem to play it right might be user error. "
