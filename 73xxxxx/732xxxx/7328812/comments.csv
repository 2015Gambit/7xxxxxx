Lauren Bacall ???????
Humphrey Bogart  
Henry Fonda ???????

No such movie?

The Petrified Forest was in 1936 and starred Bette Davis and Leslie Howard with Bogie (How he spelled it) as the Bad Guy Duke Mantee.

This was the movie that cemented Bogie and Howard's Friendship; Howard insisted on Bogie for the Part of Duke Mantee.  It's one of the movies/parts credited with making Bogie's career .  From here on it was all starring roles.  Howard and Bogie remained friends until Howard's death in Europe.

Not sure if you have the right file here, but my info is correct for The Petrified Forest.  I live in AZ.  The 1st place I visited when arriving here was the TPF, stayed a night there too.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046637/

The show featured Stars of the times and appeared monthly for while.  This one includes Bogie, Bacall & Fonda.  I believe they did a segment on The Petrified Forest during the show too.

Bogie and Bacall made 4 movies together


To Have and Have Not (Bacall's first Film)
Dark Passage
The Big Sleep
Key Largo 

There is no price to great for a chance at immortality!  Bogie; as Dixon Steele ~ In a Lonely Place. "

can you upload a better resoltuion of the film?"
,cgculpepper,2012-07-28T11:29Z,I've looked. I doubt I will find a better copy. BUT If I find one I will upload. I know the picture is rotten & what really sucks is it was filmed in color.I've got a couple more Bogart DVD's to upload + if I find any upgrades to any of my movies I will upload them.
