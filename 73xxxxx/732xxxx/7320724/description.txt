"Like the Bronte Sisters, the three women who share the lovely house known as Streetch Grange have sealed themselves off from a world they mistrust."

Classic detective mystery featuring lonely women living in a remote house who may or may not be involved with a corpse discovered in the old ice-house on the ground. The story takes the time (3 hours) to develop its characters properly, with all sorts of tangles along the way. he hostility of the community gives it a sharp edge.

A lot of people have wondered why this isn't available, well here it is. Don't watch unless you have a taste for character-driven detective fiction.

This is in segmented mpg format, it should play fine on VLC and suchlike. I have classified this TV miniseries as "movie" because it is packaged. Includes an introduction.
