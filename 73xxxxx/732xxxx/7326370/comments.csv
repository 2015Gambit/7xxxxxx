,feenaldo,2012-06-07T20:05Z,"I would also like to recomend Flac to Mp3 to convert the finished files. It can be found at:

Hope this helps you all :)"
,ichigo99,2012-06-08T07:32Z,:) thank you all for seeding and keeping this torrent alive. Cheers
,btrfngrz,2012-08-28T05:37Z,"@feenaldo - Why would anyone want a .FLAC to .MP3 converter? .FLAC's sound quality is far superior  to .MP3....and if you needed it to convert and add the files to programs like iTunes that don't support .FLAC files wouldn't you just download the .MP3? That would be alot quick than downloading .FLAC's and then converting them...

(thanks ichigo99, great upload) "
