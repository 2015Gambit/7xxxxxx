,sapo_joe,2012-06-02T04:03Z,"@psychoacer: Agreed. People sometimes seems to fail to understand how torrents work. 

BTW, there's already a repack, I'm gonna try it: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320093/Max_Payne_3_REPACK_v1.0.0.17_-_VANSIK"
,GObonzo,2012-06-02T16:36Z,"@ psycho & joe. agreed: you 2 don't know how they work.
multiple uploaders = multiple torrents from different locations, offering different bandwidths, and probably uploading at different times for some of them. if everyone stuck to the same torrent file there would be over 20,000 dloaders trying to use the same uploader's bandwidth for long while from the get go and you know damn well most of them won't keep seeding.
what the hell do you mean ""split up""? all of these RELOADED uploads offer the same game files just maybe packed differently, i.e. smaller."
,psychoacer,2012-06-02T22:28Z,"@Gobonzo
That would be fine for something smaller but when your dealing with something like this where a lot of people are downloading having many different torrents is actually a bad thing for most people. Yeah those who got in early and were the first to download from a fast seed are fine but when it comes to a ratio of 1:8 seeders to leechers then you still have the same problem as you do on other posts. If AiTB put all the same bandwidth to seeding the other torrent those torrents wouldn't be so bad. He most likely downloaded from the original one. So seed it there so we don't have to worry about getting lucky on someone elses post."

,flower_of_life,2012-07-09T09:19Z,"i logged in to tell you this torrent IS LEGIT. the only problem is you might get BSOD a couple of times...its gonna restart like a dozen times within installation up to cracking the game especially after mounting dvd 4...you can avoid this by after installing, copy the contents of dvd 4 to a different location and delete the .iso or store in flash drive or something. 

dont forget to disable fire wall and antivirus and unplug the network cable before installing then after installing and cracking go to the fire wall advanced setting, inbound rules, look for max payne 3 and block all 4 programs. 

1. unplug net cable, disable antivirus and fire wall

2.place dvd4 in a different location then mount, then copy its contents again in a diff. location this serves as a back up for the crack and patches. this is also to avoid frequent BSOD and restarts.

3.mount the files and install

4.delete the iso files or just get it out of your HD

5.open the dvd4 where you transferred it and do the patching and cracking procedures


this torrent is the same with what extremezone uploaded but its crowded there with leechers for a while so i settled for this.
