Danny Firoth is an average thirteen year old who finds himself at the beginning of his eighth grade year, struggling with the common stressors that plague a boy of his age: bullies, homework, and his mother.  Bethany Drake is the new girl.  She is beautiful, but carries a fantastic secret.  ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre a dragon!ΓÇ¥ Danny exclaims at the beginning of their epic journey.  ΓÇ£I am a drake,ΓÇ¥ corrects Bethany after a fierce battle with an ancient enemy, a Shadow.  What follows is an explanation of legends as Danny learns that a simple card game, designed to pit the forces of the Light against those of the Dark, is actually reality.

Accepted into the White Rock Academy of Illumination, a school for young Squires destined to become Knights of the Light and battle the forces of the Dark with magical weapons called Bondeds, Danny joins his five closest friends in the training of their lives.  Honed in the techniques of blade work by an Elvin swordmaster, Sir Syndil, and educated by a colorful assortment of professors, Danny and his friends are instructed in the way of the sword.  However, discovering a powerful ability within himself that may mark him as the destined savior foretold, the Mageknight, Danny must question the intentions of his instructors.  With the help of his friends, Danny must use everything he has learned to thwart the betrayal of someone within the Order of Light.
