this is the paid version. mac app store apps dont have serials. this version is cracked."
,creative_expansion,2012-06-06T00:02Z,"ok wheres the serial i had the free one downloaded your version and played it and after the demo it asked to purchase and took me to the app store. is there supposed to be a separate file with a serial? cuz when i downloaded and installed it def was the demo same size too as the free one, i was confused, if theres something I'm missing please let me know, thanks"
