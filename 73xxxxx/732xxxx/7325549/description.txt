Stingray - Stingray Revisited and Remastered (2005)

Stingray was a South African group formed in Johannesburg in 1979 and was a short-lived AOR (Album Oriented Rock) act who managed two albums before folding in the early 80's. Sounding eerily American, Stingray should've been poised for international success, but fate had other plans. Though both albums had very strong chart activity in their homeland, there was no crossover success to support the band's long-range aspirations and the band split up after continuous frustration. Despite their short run in the business, Stingray have left behind a wealth of memorable and well written AOR songs.
