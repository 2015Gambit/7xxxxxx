Brethren, written by Robyn Young, is the first of three in her best-selling trilogy.

Following historically correct happenings from the age of the Temple, Young uses the historical voids and mysteries to fill them with her own story. A wonderfully tender, horrid, thrilling, bloody and romantic story which feels so real you could easily mistake fiction from fact. 

A great number of characters are described, many the author makes you hate, and others love, and makes the story so much more addictive.

From the moment I got the book(Brethren) and got into it, I knew I had to get the rest of them. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I did, either in audio-book form, or as I recommend more fiercely; reading the book itself.

I noticed that only Swedish audio-books of Robyn Young's books had been uploaded on TBP, so I thought I might as well put on the mantle, so to speak(might as well while talking about a book about the Temple;), and upload it myself. I am Swedish, but I much prefer the English version, as many others of my origin do as well, I have noticed. 

If enough of you are interested in it, and if enough people are seeding, I will upload the sequel(Crusade) to you. And in time the third and last book(Requiem). 

Leave a comment below if you wish to have the sequels, so that I may see the demand for them :)  

Enjoy!
