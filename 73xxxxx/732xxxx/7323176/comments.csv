Thank you so much, NCC86. You've really started your uploader career on a very high note."
,NCC86,2012-06-03T08:18Z,"Thank you, Paul. Were you able to download them okay? I'm new to this and I wasn't quite sure if I was seeding them the correct way or even at all. Also, I have been trying to upload a massive torrent that includes a TON of Beatles stuff: The Beatles Stereo Box, The Beatles in Mono Box, Anthology (1,2, and 3), Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg; Germany, as well as thirteen other albums. The problem is that each time I try and upload them I get an error message that says ""Wrong Code"". I don't know what I'm going wrong. "
