AMAZING 5 minutes and 9 seconds Scene with Lex and Clark.


In my opinion this is BEST Lex&Clark scene in WHOLE Smallville series.

Without Michael Rosenbaum this show would not exist - he's brilliant actor.



To give you some context - in this episode Lex was divided into "two Lexes" after accident in lab. 



Please Seed if U like it :)
