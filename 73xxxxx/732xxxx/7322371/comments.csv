,lelouch23,2012-06-03T14:47Z,"For some reason it crash on start up...Any help??
I am using Window XP btw...Thx"
,james9946,2012-06-03T16:16Z,gansuk pls upload the maxpayne 3 now crack is available
,PirateEm,2012-06-03T17:05Z,"Plays great. 
thanks alot for the upload. I just wanted to test it out before considering the Steam copy.



Guide for dummies:
Unzip the .rar file
Double click the ~unpack~ .bat file. Let it fully complete.
Run yso_win to play. Config for your settings."
,Quartzbambi,2012-06-05T11:14Z,please upload max Payne 3 it's out now. I'm not downloading any other version waiting till kaos release. Plz upload the game with smaller size.. :)) thnx
,tinynik,2012-06-05T11:28Z,"STOP THE MAX PAYNE SPAMMING! 
THESE GUYS WILL RELEASE IT WHEN IT'S DONE. 
They don't get cred for just hoarding their cracks like gold. If the scene hasn't already got 3 other releases, I'm sure they'll do MP3."
,VegitoDBZ,2012-06-07T19:38Z,The game is actually decent. Except that it's crashing every fucking 5 minutes.
,poopertown,2012-06-08T02:56Z,wouldnt work for me until i put it in windows 2000 compatability mode then it ran fine was using XP
,ddkotan,2012-06-09T03:25Z,I got this problem where rar file 31 and 30 doesn't match the rest of the file and there are files missing from the game and it crashs on start up. Any help getting file 31 and 30 to sync with the rest of it?
,Verdy420,2012-06-10T06:44Z,Game is also crashing every 5-10 minutes for me as well and the music is cutting out during random times. I did a search for the problem and found nothing on it. Is this a torrent problem or a problem with the game itself? Anyone else experiencing this?
,Verdy420,2012-06-10T12:10Z,"Ka0sKrew,

There was a Steam update for this game on 6/4/2012. It fixed a lot of issues in the game, including crashing. Is it possible to upload the new update on here?"
,sage1210,2012-06-13T16:54Z,"win7 64bit has a lot of crash in this game.
only way to fix it is to download new update (update2) from reloaded that seem deleted from pirate bay by some reason but you can find it at ""releaselog"" website.

whatever even you get the new patch it still has crash after you beat the last boss (most ugly bug).

so..you have to play this game at ""normal preset"" but you can still change game's resolution, AA (turn off if game still crash) and AS as much as you want. "

Remember to seed sharing is caring ;P"
,refreshing_water,2012-06-21T14:41Z,"hi OP,
i seem to have some audio troubles. the music will play for the first 5 minutes till the track ends then silence. no sound effects play at all. am i the only one with this issue?
please help (: THANKS"
,ai2006,2012-06-21T23:15Z,"The wrong music was uploaded with this. The fix is to redownload from steam apparently which obviously is impossible here.

Music not looping really kills the game..."
,ai2006,2012-06-21T23:58Z,"Found a solution: 

Grab that other Ys Origin torrent (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6722613/YS_Origin_ENGLISH).

Grab the .iso, get in it with WinRAR, extract the music files (YSO_001.ogg to YSO_040.ogg) over the files here.

Thats the only solution for now. Worth it, though."

hey i tried this, but i still have the same problem. the track plays once and doesn't loop, and there are no sfx. is there anything else i may need to extract over??

thanks guys"
,ai2006,2012-06-23T05:29Z,"I don't know, I'm afraid its all working perfectly for me after that, so I can't help you at all."
,rosumparat,2012-07-11T19:29Z,"I tried all verisions available and they all fail at some point. For example the RELOADED version works ok untill the Devil's Corridor, when I have to talk the that girl. When she wants to give me some sint and a optional window appears  - the text fails to appear, the sound freezes and nothing seem to happen, although the game is still running. IF I install any of RELOADED 3 patches, the game fails to run. So I got this version. I passed that issue, but afte the lava boss, when I encounter Demon Toal the game does a similar freeze. My character starts to run towards Toal and then hits like an invisible wall. And that's it. Keeps on staying stuck in that ""wall"" while running. Nothing happens no matter how many times I reload the save OR restart the game. 
Fuck this, I'm gonna watch the gamethrough on youtube."
,Kyashii,2012-07-22T17:38Z,"Why did KaOs feel the need to encode, compress, etc so much? It takes a very long time to unpack, longer than the time saved by the reduced filesize."
,freescoring,2012-08-22T17:00Z,"My game crashes at the final battle, I am not able to complete the game :("
,DoEds07,2012-09-08T13:06Z,"I did the unpacking automatically and manually.

What was unpacked using the ~unpack.bat~ are these ""Extras"" (Folder), ""Release"" (Folder) and ""~unpack.bat~"".

But I can't find yso_win.exe anywhere in those folders.

Did I do something wrong?"
