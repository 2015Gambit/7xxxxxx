[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-03T19:43Z,"Actually it is seeded. Not sure what you mean.

That's a question you ask a few months after the torrent is uploaded, when it's really seedless.

Then again this is a variety show, so maybe it will go for a year until someone drops the ball. My Carol Burnett Show torrents lasted longer than that."
