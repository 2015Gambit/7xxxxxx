This 7th Season show has an interesting mistake with the Wild Wild West
sketch.  In the TV series it was established that James West didn't
become a Secret Service agent until President Grant appointed him in 1865.
In the SNL parody, he works for previous President Lincoln. 
It was never established that Jim West even met Lincoln, but this is comedy 
and time travel is the theme....so maybe that has something to do with it!
