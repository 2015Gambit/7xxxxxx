Delightful musical from 1957 featuring Fred Astaire as a fashion photographer (patterned on Richard Avedon) who falls for a frumpy but brainy bookseller turned model (Audrey Hepburn). Notable for its lovely use of Gershwin's tunes, the sassy performance of Kay Thompson (in her only real on-screen role) and savvy direction of Stanley Donen (starting his post-MGM career). A major improvedment in visual quality over the old DVD copies.
