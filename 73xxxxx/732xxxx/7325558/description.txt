Dan le SacΓÇÖs reputation for vibrant good times at festivals and club nights is unarguable, but heΓÇÖs also proved with ΓÇÿSpace Between The WordsΓÇÖ that heΓÇÖs a lot more than simply the bloke behind the bloke with the big beard. HeΓÇÖs a musical force to be reckoned with and in ΓÇÿSpace Between The WordsΓÇÖ, an album dan le Sac has created a smart, zingy debut shot that will appeal to fans of indie, dance, hip hop, electronica and much else besides. ItΓÇÖs one to file alongside Metronomy, Hot Chip and Field Music as a sharply individual snapshot of modern popΓÇÖs endless possibilities.
