People, please beware of the following: Extreme.Makeover.Weight.Loss.Edition.S02E01.Tony.HDTV.XviD-LOL[ettv] and
Extreme.Makeover.Weight.Loss.Edition.S02E02.Jacqui.HDTV.XviD-LOL[ettv]
They are zipped files and when you try to unzip them, they ask for a password. The .txt tells you to go for a site for the password, and then tehy ask you to take a survey and put personal info. So always look at the files included in a torrent you download, if they are .avi, mp4 etc... or they are zips or rars. "
