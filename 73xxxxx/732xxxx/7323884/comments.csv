[T],SecTPB,2012-06-03T05:06Z,"I encoded a 1080p to see the feedback I get with encoded releases since the show airs interlaced when I record it. If anyone enjoys this, I'll do these earlier every week.

The Legend of Korra - [Season 1, Episode 8] - ""When Extremes Meet."""

,bitate42,2012-06-03T16:49Z,"I love it when some moron comes on here and says there's a problem with a torrent file because their system is janky or maybe they had some file corruption. STFU GTFO, this torrent is AMAZING!

Yo, Sec, keep up the amazing work. I'll seed this file all week. I can't believe how sick the quality is streaming from my mac to our roku. Better than I'd get with local HD cable, for sure. Between this and your GoT releases, which are my two main weekly torrents right now, I just bookmark your page rather than TPB main page. You fucking rock. You are appreciated. I'd like to buy you a beer."
,rikipy,2012-06-03T19:08Z,it's a upscaling D:
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-03T20:29Z,"@bitate42
You, sir, have made a comment that has made me want to continue doing 1080p's. Thanks a lot for that comment.

@rikipy
Cable automatically detects the resolution for each channel/show, and it turns out Nick airs Korra at 480i. So virtually all 720p's are upscales as well.  That's why all Korra episodes need such huge filesizes. My 1080p is going to need even more in the future. :)"

,Lost_Leaf,2012-06-04T15:12Z,"I made an account on here just to tell you, SecTPB. That this torrent of yours is superior to anything I've ever laid my eyes upon. I never knew colours could explode beautifully within the interior of my eyes just from the sheer quality of it alone, I'm in awe. 

Definitly keep this calibre of quality up! It's astounding. I am very appreciative. You honestly don't mind the file sizes when it looks this good. 

Eveyrone! Download this even if you don't watch the series, it's a mariage of colours and detail amalgamating into the story that is Korra.

Thank you so much, SecTPB! Don't ever stop your amazing work. You inspire me."
,Shiva_vb,2012-06-06T08:36Z,"Plz Do not upscale Rips It looses quality .
