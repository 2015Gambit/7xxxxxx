,Cigala,2012-06-04T19:17Z,Is it 1280x720p without logo?
,Cigala,2012-06-04T19:21Z,"WOW, only 3 minutes to download it! 
But it has de nick hd logo :(...
I do not recomend to download it"
,PurpleImp,2012-06-04T21:02Z,"thank you for uploading this for ps3 users, ive gotten all my legend of korra episodes from you, keep up the good work!"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-04T21:45Z,Does the Logo really bother you that much. if you want HD non logo get it from PublicHD.
,Cigala,2012-06-04T22:31Z,Actually PublicHD doesn't have the 1280x720p that i want it. He does in lower quality (960x720)
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-05T05:37Z,"resolution does not mean Quality. the Itunes,web rip that public HD does is much better quality than what Nick releases so is better quality than this. even if it has lower resolution."
,Cigala,2012-06-05T07:37Z,"I know, but I wish a wider version of the chapter, because 960x720 is 4:3."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-05T08:43Z,"well after the The legend of korra ends which is soon. 
i will release a non logo 1280x720 complete version with mp4 format. for all you Xbox and ps3 fans."
,ChocoMonkey,2012-06-05T10:29Z,"Are you really bugged by a logo? Like, get over yourself. This guy's uploading them quickly. If a tv channel's logo bugs you so much, go buy the DVD's. Thanks Daman, love the torrents!"
,CombustionMan1,2012-06-05T12:14Z,"Thank you for your dedication Daman4life, even with the slight hiccup you still got a fixed version out even if it was extra work for you.

To the person complaining about the logo, seriously? The show is still airing, just be happy you got such a high quality 720p version at such a small size."
,Cigala,2012-06-05T21:28Z,"I'm not complaining to Daman. I only asking me why the 2 last chapters without logo were in 960x720, but the other 6 were in normal 1280x720 format."
,CreeperChris,2012-06-07T06:52Z,"So ive downloaded, put it on my Flash drive and tried playing it on my X box, Video isnt found? Am i doing something wrong ?"
