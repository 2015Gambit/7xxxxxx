WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


Version 4.20 beta 3

1. "Estimate" function in WinRAR "Info" command is adjusted to
faster WinRAR 4.20 compression when calculating the expected
compression time.

2. GUI SFX module -sp switch passes parameters to setup application
only if no other parameters were specified in "Setup" command
in SFX script. So "Setup" command has a higher priority than -sp.

Regardless of -sp presence, setup application can read 
the full SFX command line from sfxcmd environment variable.

3. "Save current settings" button in "Advanced SFX options" dialog
is now available only when converting an existing archive to SFX.
Options saved with this button are applied only to convert to SFX
operation.

If you create or update SFX archive, only SFX options stored
in default compression profile are used. Options saved
in "Advanced SFX options" dialog are ignored for these operations.
