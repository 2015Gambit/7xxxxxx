To unlock the second map ""Five"" normally, you have to first complete the single-player campaign mode â&#x20AC;&#x201C; not anymore. If you would like to know how to unlock it straight away, continue on reading.

Open game from Zombie shortcut ,after full loading game and you are on Menu break out of your chair (hit Space key repeatedly) and head to the small computer in room. Type in the following sequence ""3arc unlock"" (with a space in between and without quotes). If you have done it correctly, you should see a message saying the cheat has been activated pop up on screen.

Head back to your chair and start up a zombie game, youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;ll now see that all maps have been unlocked straight away! 
Have fun playing map  Five !"

,darkriot427,2012-06-26T14:01Z,It was the patch file that I hadn't downloaded yet. Everything was running fine after but now I can't get the command line when using the ~ key in multiplayer anymore.. I tried adding -console to the shortcut but still won't show up. Any ideas how to fix without uninstall/reinstall?
