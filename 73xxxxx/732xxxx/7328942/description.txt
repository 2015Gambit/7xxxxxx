           Desc: Catch the rythm and feel the heat of this 
           nonstop, rappin' house party starring Mario Van 
           Peebles (Ali), Tasia Valenza and Eriq La Salle ("ER")!
           Feauturing the talents of some of hip-hop's biggest 
           stars, Rappin' is an explosive film that put rap on 
           the map! 
           
           Just out of jail, John "Rappin'" Hood (Van Peebles) 
           returns to his old neighborhood to find it is 
           threatened by a money grubbing developer and a vicious
           gang leader. To save the homes of his family and 
           friends - and win the heart of the girl he loves - 
           Hood rallies his gang of fast-talking friends to fight
           back, not with their fists... but with their 
           streetwise rap.

           Notes: Nice bit of 80s cheese. Also, note that from 
           now on AMiGOS will be a strictly x264 release group.

           appropriate crf.
