Three years after their debut, You and I, Cut Off Your Hands returned with Hollow, which featured new guitarist/vocalist Jonathan Lee as well as a revamped sound. The spiky post-punk-isms and experimental ballads of their first album were replaced with a shimmering sound that evoked the breezy melancholy of the Smiths as well as the grooves of late-ΓÇÿ80s Manchester.   Hollow's finest moments channel the energy the band had on You and I into this smoother approach: opening track and lead single ΓÇ£You Should Do BetterΓÇ¥ bounces along on guitar filigrees and singer Nick Johnston's newfound croon.  A more concise and consistent outing than their debut, Hollow reaffirms that while Cut Off Your Hands may not be innovators, theyΓÇÖre still quite good at what they do.
