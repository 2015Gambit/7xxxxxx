Can't be downloaded unless someone who got the whole thing seeds it...or posts a new torrent with other trackers.

Thanks"
,mbananaaa,2012-06-06T06:52Z,"Seriously, noeldieg0? I understand downloading free ports of games when they're not available natively on Mac. And I get not wanting to fork over 60 bucks to EA or even 20 bucks to Apple. But this is 8 bucks for charity. And not like old people charities, but like the EFF, which basically defends this site's right to exist and our right to access it. At least wait until the bundle purchase period has passed before you upload this. Sweet crackers."

,noeldieg0,2012-06-07T05:02Z,"@mbananaaa What's wrong in testing before donating?

I donated 8 dollars because i liked limbo. Bastion and the others are not running well in my mbp.

You donate if you want to. I'm not impeding anyone of going there and donating. Even if you don't want any games."
,creative_expansion,2012-06-08T03:02Z,@mbananaaa.....r u seriously complaining that he posted it too soon? r u serious? if your so hung ho about paying for them you wouldn't be on this site downloading the free games....idiot. thanks uploader!
,mbananaaa,2012-06-08T07:22Z,"Yeah. I am. All of these games are available via individual torrents that are still healthy. People that really want these games either already have them or can easily get them. This upload serves no constructive purpose. ""testing before donating"" $8 is the laziest cop out I've ever heard. If you've got a computer that's new enough to run these games, you can afford to lose $8 on a whim.

You just aren't thinking about the big picture here - try developing some principles and taking a side. If you enjoy the ability to pirate software, I don't understand why you would want to deter people from donating to a watchdog group that defends the freedoms that allow you to do so. You're defeating your own cause."
,noeldieg0,2012-06-08T13:00Z,"@mbananaaa I'm not trying to achieve a purpose here, other than seed something for those who want it. Still don't see why people can't download, play, like it and donate. 06 days remaining.

@everyone Hey, i got a bad upload speed (60KB/s tops). But i'll leave it on (seeding) for days from now on. Sorry for the slowness."
,noeldieg0,2012-06-08T13:14Z,"About the games:

Bastion - Nice graphics and gameplay but still there are serious issues about the graphics. Every time I change locations (bastion to lvls ou proving grounds) I gotta change in Help & Options -> Display -> Vertical Sync: On to Off (or Off to On). This solution makes the screen flicker and turns back the game to a ""normal"" state.

Limbo - An awesome game, with breathtaking ending and simple, but wonderful, gameplay.

Psychonauts - Despite the big fuzz about it's awesomeness, I couldn't get it to play fullscreen (it crashes), so I can't say anything about it.

Amnesia - It's not my type of game, i don't like that style. The farthest i could get on a creepy/horror/scare like game was Resident Evil 2 on PS1.

Sword And Sorcery - Still knowing the game. It has simple controls and a nice pixelated graphics. Only played a little and it seems really nice."
