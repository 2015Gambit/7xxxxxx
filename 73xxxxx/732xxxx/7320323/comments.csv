1. Install the game, firewall all executables (http://www.trishtech.com/win7/block_a_program_in_windows_firewall.php). 5 executables total in the game directory.

2. Install everything here: Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3Updates

3. Install everything in the 'Redistributables' folder on Disc 4. 

4. Download this crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7319670/Max.Payne.3.CRACK.ONLY-RELOADED. Copy over the data from the crack. Copy the profile folder to UsernameDocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club.

5. Tap the Enter key at the game menu to start.

,cainyboy,2012-06-03T17:52Z,"Just to say this DOES work, win 7 64bit

Once again for clarity do this:

1. Burn or mount the image.

2. Install the game. When it tries to get updates after install, abort. Then install the required game updates found in the CrackUpdates dir on DVD4 (Launcher, Social Club, MP3 main game).

3. Copy over the ""profiles"" dir, also found in the Crack dir on DVD4 to your DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club dir.(%USERPROFILE%DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club). If it isn't there make new folder.

4. Copy over the cracked content, ie. the rest of the files, from the Crack dir on DVD4 to your installation dir.

5. Play the game offline. Make sure that all the games exe files are blocked from going online by using your system or third party firewall to prevent outgoing connections on every game exe file. Do this before starting the game. 


One thing to note, when starting the game a little rockstar updater runs DO NOT CLOSE IT, game will not run if you do. just block maxpayne.exe in firewall and it doesn't download anything.

Enjoy game :)


Thank you extremezone."

If you thought that this torrent could deliver atleat 2.5mb's that means the seeders had to upload at 60 megabyte per sec EACH!

,relicek,2012-06-04T01:02Z,"I will tell how you will rid of BSOD in crack directory or blackbox version and how to proper install RELOADED version with all updates with no errors or problems. I had problems from friday with this and i solved it now and no problems at all now.

1. Have Windows 7 with SP1, you need SP1 and you will no longer get BSOD for 100%. I had problems with BSOD with reloaded version, even cant opened crack folder on DVD4 and i got BSOD. After i reinstall my old version of windows 7 to newer with SP1 the problem was solved.

2. Install game

3. When installation is finished cancel auto updates when autoupdate window appeared.

4. Open DVD4, Crack folder, Updates and install all 3 exes.

5. Copy dlc folder, binkw32.dll,gsrld.dll and MaxPayne3.exe to your max payne installed folder and rewrite all when asked.

6. Press windows key + R, write wf.msc to command line.  On windows firewall window left up is outbound rules, click on it, then on right click on 'new rule'. Select Program, next, browse for maxpayne3.exe, block the connection, next all check (domain, private, publi), next, name it example: maxpayne.exe and click finish. Make this same for Playmaxpayne3.exe. Now you exes are blocked from connecting to internet.

7. Start PlayMaxPayne3.exe. Click Offline mode. When it starts game (maybe some problems with clicking resolution but it will be fixed in few seconds) just press alt+tab, go to your user documents folder/rockstargames/socialclub/ and here copy from DVD4/crack/profiles folder.

8. Go back to game, press HOME, Sign in, and you will see one account on left, just click on it and you will be logged for your offline mode game without any problems and all game progress will be saved properly.

9. Enjoy game and buy it later as i will do it :)"

1.Let the game update.

2.Install revolts crack

3.I already had a Social club account so i recommend you register before playing.

4.(most important) Instead of starting the game from playmaxpayne3.exe press your windows key and search for max payne 3.After the search you should see max payne 3 safe mode play that and it will work.The only things you cant change in the options is directx(only 9) and quality of textures(normal)"

It worked in both versions without prob when i just disabled my network card (easy to enable/disable via device manager).

So I went to Documents and created a folder called ""Rockstar Games""  then inside of that folder I created another folder called ""Social Club"" and inside that folder is where I put the ""profiles"" folder.  I didn't create a username with social club or anything because that is what this profile folder is for.  The main thing is to just keep your computer offline for the entire time that you are installing and playing this game."

,FiveFour,2012-06-06T01:19Z,"subir_cooldude,

BSOD on file transfer is almost always one of three things:

1) Faulty hard drive.  (use badblocks from a live Linux CD to test this)
2) Faulty RAM. (use memtest86+ from a live Linux CD to test this)
3) Bad software/driver configuration (much more complicated to test; you probably need to take it to a shop)

If 1 or 2 is the case, you just need to replace the hardware.  Unless you're very savvy, you won't be able to diagnose 3.

Anyway, it has nothing to do with the torrent, so it's best not to discuss it further here.  Good luck."

,morph9927,2012-06-06T02:15Z,"After having prolems with BSOD (blue screen of death) whilst attempting to open crack folder i've found out its due to in my case win7 64bit not having service pack 1 installed and have been reading a conversation between Extremezone and dany31 using google translate the fix worked for me after using this link http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7318220/Max_Payne_3_Crack_Only_Fixed-REVOLT and following these instructions from credits to relicek

 1. Have Windows 7 with SP1, you need SP1 and you will no longer get BSOD for 100%. I had problems with BSOD with reloaded version, even cant opened crack folder on DVD4 and i got BSOD. After i reinstall my old version of windows 7 to newer with SP1 the problem was solved.

 2. Install game

 3. When installation is finished cancel auto updates when autoupdate window appeared.

 4. Open DVD4, Crack folder, Updates and install all 3 exes.

 5. Copy dlc folder, binkw32.dll,gsrld.dll and MaxPayne3.exe to your max payne installed folder and rewrite all when asked.

 6. Press windows key + R, write wf.msc to command line. On windows firewall window left up is outbound rules, click on it, then on right click on 'new rule'. Select Program, next, browse for maxpayne3.exe, block the connection, next all check (domain, private, publi), next, name it example: maxpayne.exe and click finish. Make this same for Playmaxpayne3.exe. Now you exes are blocked from connecting to internet.

 7. Start PlayMaxPayne3.exe. Click Offline mode. When it starts game (maybe some problems with clicking resolution but it will be fixed in few seconds) just press alt+tab, go to your user documents folder/rockstargames/socialclub/ and here copy from DVD4/crack/profiles folder.

 8. Go back to game, press HOME, Sign in, and you will see one account on left, just click on it and you will be logged for your offline mode game without any problems and all game progress will be saved properly.

just using the revolt crack didnt work I still had to redo these instructions step by step and was then able to play.

Max Payne 3 is it me or does this feel just like GTA to play but with a voice over and bullet time mod and map restriction i know that rockstar also do make GTA but i was hoping for a unique game engine for a unique feel, trouble with using same game engine is it makes the games feel the same too codemasters know all about that and rockstar are following suit hhhmmm milk"
,Shadow416,2012-06-06T02:17Z,"(read everything before continuing my steps)


after install is done DVD 4 should be mounted. 
 		 open crack folder. 
	         open updates folder.
		 Run Social Club v1.0.9.5
                 Run Partch Update 1.0.0.17
                 Run Launcher 1.13.0.0

		 Copy everything INSIDE the crack folder EXCEPT UPDATES AND PROFILE to the install 

directory of the game max payne 3. ex: C: program files/rockstar/max payne 3

                  Run the file ""PlayMaxPayne3"" enjoy. (i use windows 7, dont forget to either 

disconnect internet or block any connections to the file, on windows 7 firewall settings the one 

where you allow a program to access or not, you'll see the file called Max Payne 3 that is the 

same file as as ""PlayMaxPayne3"" so just disable that). The request may come up again while running 

the game to allow access just click cancel.


		AFTER YOU RUN THE GAME AND REACH SIGN IN SCREEN---CLICK TOP RIGHT ""SIGN IN"" THEN 

WHEN IT ASKS FOR USER ACCOUNT PASSTWORD ETC CLOSE THE PROGRAM (TOP RIGHT X ON THE WINDOW) THEN GO 

BACK TO DVD4 CRACK FOLDER AND Copy  profiles folder and paste it to the social club folder 

""userprofile""DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club (you're in the right folder when you see

Follow the steps i created. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THE PROFILE from the crack folder.

Just go to the social club website sign up its free, enable the internet access to the maxpayne3 file in the firewall...then run the game sign in save profile, THEN exit block the program from firewall again, run maxpayne3 when you login just use the saved profile, once in your alt+tab to the updater and close that, then resume your game.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7333230/Max.Payne.3.v1.0.0.22.patch.cracked.READ.NFO-THETA

Works with RELOADED release after I already applied REALOADED's Updates, profile, dlc and Crack. I had already start playing the game too and I have no problem. I play offline and stay offline while playing.

1. Install the patch MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22
2. Copy over the contents of the /Crack dir to your installation
directory

NOTES

* This release does not include any previous patches, thus should be used only after v1.0.0.17 patch is installed.

CHANGELOG

* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodgeï¿½. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu).
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu.
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available. Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards)."

Max Payne 3 is it me or does this feel just like GTA to play but with a voice over and bullet time mod and map restriction i know that rockstar also do make GTA but i was hoping for a unique game engine for a unique feel, trouble with using same game engine is it makes the games feel the same too codemasters know all about that and rockstar are following suit hhhmmm milk"

 1. Have Windows 7 with SP1, you need SP1 and you will no longer get BSOD for 100%. I had problems with BSOD with reloaded version, even cant opened crack folder on DVD4 and i got BSOD. After i reinstall my old version of windows 7 to newer with SP1 the problem was solved.

 2. Install game

 3. When installation is finished cancel auto updates when autoupdate window appeared.

 4. Open DVD4, Crack folder, Updates and install all 3 exes.

 5. Copy dlc folder, binkw32.dll,gsrld.dll and MaxPayne3.exe to your max payne installed folder and rewrite all when asked.

 6. Press windows key + R, write wf.msc to command line. On windows firewall window left up is outbound rules, click on it, then on right click on 'new rule'. Select Program, next, browse for maxpayne3.exe, block the connection, next all check (domain, private, publi), next, name it example: maxpayne.exe and click finish. Make this same for Playmaxpayne3.exe. Now you exes are blocked from connecting to internet.

 7. Start PlayMaxPayne3.exe. Click Offline mode. When it starts game (maybe some problems with clicking resolution but it will be fixed in few seconds) just press alt+tab, go to your user documents folder/rockstargames/socialclub/ and here copy from DVD4/crack/profiles folder.

 8. Go back to game, press HOME, Sign in, and you will see one account on left, just click on it and you will be logged for your offline mode game without any problems and all game progress will be saved properly.

I'm not saying this torrent has a virus, if you'd read what i said again, perhaps you'd understand instead of jumping down my throat. 

I'm asking if someone could upload their ""setup.exe"" from dvd 1 onto the net so i can install the game as the ""setup.exe"" that i downloaded with my torrent was laced with a trojan. If anyone could do that for me i'd appreciate it, as would the other 400 people who got duped with the original virus laden release would, thank you."

,KEiGHT(R),2012-06-07T19:16Z,"If all of you will follow my instructions there's no need to close internet connection to play this game and all of you can stay at seed , please seed for others too at minimum 10KB/s :).. in that way all of you will be helpful. Thanks again !"
,KEiGHT(R),2012-06-07T19:19Z,"NO NEED ANYMORE TO CLOSE THE INTERNET CONNECTIONS AND YOU COULD STAY AT SEED! JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD!

First thing first before install the game to be sure the exe file don't connect to internet!

00. Enter into your Anti-Virus Firewall and add to block from conect to internet thos two file maxpayne3.exe and playmaxpayne3.exe
(Your game will get stuck at the loading screen if you don't do this);
01. Run setup. It will ask you to disable antivirus, but is not necessary because you've blocked those files already. don't do that!
02. At end of setup the game wants to update. Just click abort;
03. Open DVD4Crack to access the cracked files and updates;
Run the mp_patch_update_1_0_0_17.exe setup;
Run the mp3_launcher_1_13_0_0.exe setup;
Run the social club v1.0.9.6 setup.exe;
Copy the cracked files(binkw32,gsrld,MaxPayne3) too into your installation directory and overwrite;
Transfer the dlc files from the crack folder to the dlc folder in the Max Payne 3 folder and    overwrite;
04. Run the game... from PlayMaxPayne3.exe file and select offline mode(if anti-virus says to connect that exe to internet choose deny); 
05. When the game required to sign to Social Club just Press Alt + Tab and Copy the profiles directory from DVD4 crack directory to the DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club directory if is created already, if is not created yet,get out of the game and enter again after you find that root.  This is important to be done in that way specifically!!
06. Restart the PC because the game may running slowly, just in case!
07. Play from PlayMaxPayne3.exe, choose offline mode;
08. Click on the panel SIGN from the right that ICON BLUE for the first time!"

,KEiGHT(R),2012-06-07T21:14Z,For all who can;t change the settings on video card here it is out now : Max Payne 3 Update v1 0 0 22-RELOADED
,KEiGHT(R),2012-06-07T21:14Z,"Patch Update

Compatibility Issues
* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS

Various Crashes
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game

Audio Crash
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game

Mouse Sensitivity
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodge. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting

Mouse Acceleration
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu)

Stretched Image / Wrong Aspect Ratio
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height  (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu

Video Memory Reporting as 0MB
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available.  Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards)

We are aware of a few outstanding issues including multiplayer cheaters and hackers. Rest assured this will be dealt with in a forthcoming patch."

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the instructions from the uploader:

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)

,TheNemmy,2012-06-08T19:03Z,"okay I may help someone, I installed this game today but when started it I got stuck on loading screen, disabled internet , tried everything but no luck... after 2 hours .. I successfully ran the game here's how :

1. Disable Internet or Blck both maxpayne exes through firewall..

2. Run 3 Setups from updates folder, no need to copy paste them anywhere just install them..

3. Copy dlc folder to installed directory with both dll files and cracked maxpayne3.exe

4. Now Copy the profiles folder to c:usersxxxxmy documentsrockstar gamesSocial Club

if there are no such folders like rockstar games or social club create them with exact names in exact locations...

if somehow you've updated the game by going online don't worry just don't forget to copy dlc and cracked exe and dll files over installed directory, that's it, now it's working fine for me...

If I helped you hit some ads on my website netfireflies dot com... thanks"

I press ctrl+alt+F4 is because when I tried to press ctrl+tab, it isn't working. the screen just freezed at there. As I said when I started the program it just stucked at the first screen.

1) For BLUE SCREEN missing of Service Pack 1 in Windows 7 is the blame for it! just update your OS with SP1!

2) For BLACK SCREEN you need to block these 2 files(MaxPayne3.exe, PlayMaxPayne3.exe) to connect on internet.

3) Update your Video Card to the latest Drivers and the Audio Card too.

4) The ""profile"" folder you'll have to copy ONLY when the game start and ask for it on SOCIAL CLUB!

,KEiGHT(R),2012-06-10T18:20Z,"First thing to be done before install the game to be sure
the exe files(MaxPayne3.exe and PlayMaxPayne3.exe) don't connect to internet!
How to do that:

    Enter into your Anti-Virus Firewall and add to block from connect to internet
    these two files maxpayne3.exe and playmaxpayne3.exe;
   (Your game will get stuck at the loading screen if you don't do this);
    Update your Video Card and Audio Card with latest drivers;
    Make sure you have installed on Windows 7 Service Pack 1;
    (if is NOT Blue Screen you'll have);

Installation Notes:

01. Run setup. It will ask you to disable antivirus, but is not necessary because
    you've blocked those files already. don't do that!
02. At the end of setup the game wants to update. Just click CANCEL;
03. Open DVD4/Crack to access the cracked files and updates;
    - Run the mp_patch_update_1_0_0_17.exe setup and mp_patch_update_1_0_0_22;
    - Run the mp3_launcher_1_13_0_0.exe setup;
    - Run the social club v1.0.9.6 setup.exe;
    - Copy the cracked files(binkw32,gsrld,MaxPayne3)
      too into your installation directory and overwrite;
      For Windows 7 SP1(You must have SP1 installed, otherways you'll get a Blue Screen)
    - Copy the dlc files from the Crack folder to the dlc folder
      in the Max Payne 3 folder and overwrite;
04. Run the game... from PlayMaxPayne3.exe file and select offline mode
    (if anti-virus says to connect that exe to internet choose deny for block connection to internet); 
05. When the game required to sign to Social Club just Press Alt + Tab and 
      copy the profiles directory from DVD4/Crack directory to 
      (%USERPROFILE%DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club) if is already created,
      if is not created yet,get out of the game and enter again after you find that root.
      (this is important to be done in that way specifically!);
      Going online and using your own profile might be possible, but it
      is at your own risk;
06. Restart the PC because the game may running slowly, just in case!
07. Play from PlayMaxPayne3.exe, choose offline mode;
08. Click on the panel SIGN from the right that ICON BLUE named 2012RLD for the first time!
09. If you still have problems with Black Screen loading, open  Documents/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/graphics
    and change resfresh rate to 60HZ, save and get rid of the BLACK SCREEN !!!

Enjoy it !"

it's simple: open your antivirus/firewall and write there the name of those executable files with extension .exe of course. :) and add them to be blocked.

i don't have firewall in free AVG and i tried with comodo firewall and it doesn't let me enter it makes me choose a file, any firewall suggestions ?

After you install the game you can do all this without worry. You don't need to block it before you install just make sure you don't try to run the updater or anything.
So first go to windows firewall (control panel > Windows Firewall)
On your left hand side you will see advanced settings click that bitch
Now click Inbound Rules
Find all your Max Payne rules. Right click one and go to properties. Then in properties click block the connection (don't touch the Enabled check mark). Do the same thing for your other Max Payne rules
Now after you finished that go to Outbound Rules
Click New Rules on your right hand side.
It should already be set to program so click next.
Click Browse and find MaxPayne3.exe.
After you selected it click next and then you will be given a screen to block the app. Block the connection and hit next and your almost done. Just repeat the new rule option for PlayMaxPayne3.exe and you will be good to go (if you installed all the updates and cracks that is). This is how I got out of the forever loading load screen and into the game. "

,Cash8844,2012-06-12T19:00Z,"Thanks a lot extremezone always a pleasure downloading your warez.

To all experiencing problems regarding the install follow these steps exactly as detailed below.

###############################
VERY IMPORTANT: to resolve BSOD issue on Windows 7, update to service pack 1. Make sure that your graphics drivers are updated to the latest, I'm running Forceware 301.42 for my Nvidia GPU, ATI users need to update to the latest Catalyst drivers. Only after these criteria are met should you attempt the install.
###############################

1) Be connected to the internet. Using your choice of virtual drive emulation software (Daemon Tools etc.) mount disk 1 and proceed with setup, do not click the Social Club button, choose typical install and continue. 

2)The installer will prompt for the remaining three disks, mount the relevant disk when required. Once installation has completed click finish and the game will try to update, just click cancel.

3) With disk four still mounted navigate to folder crackUpdates. Install Social Club, the game update and launcher update.

4) Copy the profiles folder to C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesSocial Club

5) Click start > run then type wf.msc
This will open the config for the Windows Firewall. Add new rules to outbound rules for these three programs
C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesSocial Clubrenderer.exe

C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3MaxPayne3.exe

C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3PlayMaxPayne3.exe

Make sure your antivirus also blocks these exe's.

6) Back on disk four copy all content (including updates folder) from the crack folder to 
C:Program Files(x86)Rockstar GamesMax Payne 3

7) Launch the game from the launcher PlayMaxPayne3.exe, when prompted by the updater just select offline mode. You should see the Social Club auto sign in prompt appear in the top right hand side of the screen. Hit alt+tab and copy the profiles folder from the crack directory on disk four to DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club

8) Revert back to the game screen and press the home key to sign in using the newly copied profile. The game should be at the title screen press enter to continue, set your graphics options and have fun.

I had some trouble setting this game up but follow these steps and you should be OK, hope you all enjoy and appreciate this excellent game. :)"

What the fuck are you talking about, you ESL retard? My game runs fucking perfectly on the highest settings, AND, i already finished the game on hard mode. So, again, what the fuck are you talking about ""you don't know nothing about games""... which by the way is a double negative meaning i DO know something about games, so perhaps you were just giving me a compliment - if that's the case; thank you!

You don't have to restart your computer after installing graphics card updates, i mean, I DID because of the lag(which did not help), but you most certainly don't have to - the changes apply immediately(the card restarts itself during update). So, clearly it's YOU that don't know shit about computers, or gaming. Now sit down, STFU, and let the big boys talk... you just look fucking stupid."

For the love of god, don't listen to that 'KEiGHT(R)' faggot, the piece of shit is dumber than a box of hammers. The simplest thing to do is just follow the instructions offline(disconnect your internet - it takes two fucking seconds), install the game, apply the patches/crack, then fucking play.

Reconnect your internet when you're done playing - it literally could not be any simpler, and there's no fucking need to fuss with installing shitty programs that don't work anyway. If it doesn't work than you didn't install properly(meaning with internet disconnected). Also, some anti-virus programs will delete the 'gsrld.dll' file from the main dir of the game, so make sure you stop that from happening, too.

,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-06-12T20:56Z,"One last thing...

The 'OFFLINE MODE' option will NOT work(meaning, your game will be stuck on the loading screen forever), if you're not blocking the game from connecting to the internet - easiest way to do that? As I've stated already, just disconnect your fucking internet then run the game - so. fucking. simple.

When the option floater with the 'offline mode' pops up when you run the game, the background should be RED, meaning it's being blocked from updating. If it's green your game will most likely not run. Just FYI."

Do you use windows 7 SP 1 under x64 bits?
Did you block both executable on your AntiVirus Firewall ? Update your video card with the latest drivers... It seems cuz in most of laptops this game have problems yet. Even those who buy this game have problems. 

SO, my advise is to run this game in OS x32 with latest SP : for XP SP3, Vista SP2, W7 SP1. 

I am on w7 SP1 X32 and I made this steps to run the game(It's RELOADED not STEAM):
I've blocked both exe MaxPayne3 and PlayMaxPayne3 in Firewall of AntiVirus. 
I disable Windows Firewall(even if there the exe(s) are enabled, no problem with them at all). 
I run the setup until the social club need to update and i click CANCEL button to abort.
Update only from Updates from Crack folder on DVD4. Launcher_1_13_0_0; 1.0.0.17 then 1.0.0.22 then Social Club;
Copy the dlc to your installation path and overwrite; Copy the cracked files(MaxPayne3.exe;gsrld.dll;binkw32.dll) into your directory also!

I create a shortcut on my desktop(for PlayMaxPayne3) and clicked right / properties and on Target: ""E:GAMES_INSTALLED/MP3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -scofflineonly
shows like this. 

Do NOT put the installation folder name ""D:/Max Payne 3"" !!!
instead of this rename it ""MP3"". D:/MP3
Run the game for the first time , wait to appear Social Club then press ALT+TAB to copy from Crack folder ""profiles "" to:

Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club
Exit the game from task bar menu. Restart your PC. 

The black screen appear only when the exe go through your firewall to connect to internet! If that go through, you'll have a black screen !

If you still have problems with Black Screen loading, open and edit:

Documents/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/graphics
    and set Refresh Rate value=""60"", save and get rid of the BLACK SCREEN !!!

Or if you want to play offline only , just disconnect your internet and try like that!

Regards! "

,KEiGHT(R),2012-06-13T12:53Z,"ANOTHER WAY TO GET RID OF BLACK SCREEN MADE BY KEIGHT(R):

It seemes that the 'Documents - Rockstar Games' need to have write permission to get the game working, because after that the game is running well.

I'm using Windows 7 64 bit by the way.

PS. Another glitch was when the sidekick Passos was standing at a staircase at a New York roof, but refused to do anything. Nothing happened. Then I just closed the game and started again, and then the cut scene kicked in as it should when I walked to Passos.

My two cents...

1. turn off your internet. this is the safest way to install the game, you can deal with the firewall crap after you get the game up and running for the first time.

2. in Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club
this is where you drag the ""profiles"" folder.
chances are you do not have this directory so you have to make it.
to do this it has to be exact spelling including caps. so make a new folder in 
""user name""/Documents
after you make the new folders it should look like this when its finished.

 I thought I had fixed it but I was mistaken. It's still fucked up. Very few people seem to be having this problem Most can't get the game to load. If you follow the direction installing it is easy.

This problem seems very specific. There's not enough people to gather info on. Is it a vista only problem?

Is it an installation issue? Some sort of driver conflict? This game is only 10 hours long and I've spent far more time than that fucking around trying to get the damn thing to work.

,helppleasehelp,2012-06-16T09:50Z,"@happycamperjon I'm not entirely sure how I got it to work, lol. But I understand your frustration. It took 4-5 installs, and several days to fix the problem. 

To start with I uninstalled the game completely, removing every bit of rockstar or profile files. Then ran a registry cleaner to remove all traces. Ccleaner works well and is free.

Then I followed KEiGHT(R)  direction step by step. Burt first I unplugged the internet and turned of my anti virus. (might not be necessary, but I stopped taking chances) Then I reinstalled and did as @KEiGHT(R) suggested by changing the install destination from:
C:program files/rockstar games/Max Payne 3 to
C:program files/rockstar games/MP3

Then as per KEiGHT(R):
Run the setup until the social club need to update and i click CANCEL button to abort.
Update only from Updates from Crack folder on DVD4. Launcher_1_13_0_0; 1.0.0.17 then 1.0.0.22 then Social Club;
Copy the dlc to your installation path and overwrite; Copy the cracked files(MaxPayne3.exe;gsrld.dll;binkw32.dll) into your directory also!

Create a shortcut on desktop(for PlayMaxPayne3) and clicked right / properties and on Target: 
C:program files/rockstar games//MP3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -scofflineonly (shows like this) 


Cross your fingers and hope for luck, lol. It worked for me, just to play is safe I unplug the internet and turn off the AV every time I play, might not be needed but I'm taking NO chanced and messing it up.

Occasionally my anti virus deletes the gsrld.dll and I have to re copy it for the game to work again. Good luck, hope it helps. I don't think you can play online with a cracked game though."

But why does this happen........??? Is there anyway to fix it....?

i'm not going to say it lives up to all expectations, but you're seriously asking why people would download the latest sequel in one of the most popular series ever?  especially after they've read the reviews and combined meta-score is 90/100.

seems like you'd be the last person to listen to if downloading a free game in the background while you do whatever the hell else you want in the meantime is enough of an excuse for everyone to avoid this game.  but my favorite part is when you say ""it's not even a good game"" in the same comment as ""maybe if it wasn't 26gb i would actually try it"".  your stupidity is boundless."

,samerdl,2012-06-22T21:44Z,"i copied this game to my brother's laptop he couldn't get it to work, he had all the errors: stuck in loading, after loading gets profile wrong pw etc...

All you gota do is do it all over, not re-install, but After you installed patched, copied crack, -profile.. Just because you had internet on and updated 'patch' for a few seconds you messed up your game so.. 

1-Recopy crack over to Dir, don't start game yet.
2-Delete the profile in the social dir. 
3-Disable internet, don't block mp3 by firewall lol.
4-start game.. Loads, says no profiles >> Press alt + enter to switch to window mode then alt tab to switch to folders > Dont close mp3.
5-copy profile from cracked dir to social club dir, make sure its the right dir, read the instructions..Do this while mp3 is still open. 
6-switch back to game, press escape on the social club if you still had it open, then press home again > will show a profile, log in.. and play. 

Main problem is patching the game on first run.

Anyway i downloaded so many shitty fucking games that don't even look half as good as this, latest being the witcher 2 crapper of shit, i couldn't even get it to run on solid fps, Mp3 runs good on max detail and uses very few cpu/gpu. "

1.) On Windows 7, open control panel>system and security>Windows Firewall>Advanced Settings

2.) Under inbound rules, click new rule, navigate to maxpayne3.exe and block it.

3.) Do the same for playmaxpayne3.exe and renderer.exe under the social club directory.

4.) Under outbound rules, do the same thing for the same executables

5.) The game will automatically login to 2012RLD each time you star the game with your internet still connected (assuming you followed danwat1234's guide and logged in once with the internet off)"

That's because you're a fucking idiot and don't know how to do fuck all. Everyone else on the planet seemed to be able to find them but you, how fucking stupid you must feel, huh?

Small dick, chubby? I guess i must be pretty lucky because i'm neither of those things, i'm 6'2"" 190lbs and your mom hasn't complained once about my cock, not once. Pretty sure i've had more sex in highschool than you will ever dream about in your entire life... don't even get me started on the shit i did in college. If you want to keep talking like a bitch then let's post facebook links and see who's the one talking smack, even make a personal post just for your dick loving ass. Yeah, that should shut you up.

Now why don't you whine and bitch some more how i hurt your feelings for pointing out what a complete and utter retard you must be for not seeing the shit on DVD 4. Just fucking kill yourself, bro.

@KEiGHT(R)

I already put you in your place, cunt. Fucking deal with it. And once again, learn to fucking speak english if you're going to keep conversing with me. You just look fucking stupid, as usual, lol. Most of these ppl are fucking retards, so it makes sense that a retard is ""helping"" them. The idiots just need to fucking disable their internet and play in offline mode and the game will work... but the fags are trying to block shit and it's not happening. Fucking morons. You have WAY too much time on your hands, pussy. Go outside and talk to girls... if you're not too fucking ugly that is, lol.

Stop fucking telling ppl to press the HOME button, you DON'T have to press the HOME button OR make a fake account, it's already made, fucknut. It's just that most of these idiots are playing the game online and trying to ""block"" the game, which is a waste of time, so they're getting all these idiotic loading screens and errors.

,projectjx,2012-06-29T01:41Z,"Followed instructions. 
Dis-connected internet.
Clicked on ""Play Offline""

Worked Great!!! 

Part 4 of the instructions are a bit hard to understand... because of the spaces missing.

4. Copy over the ""profiles"" dir, also found in the Crack dir on DVD4 to
your Documents, Rockstar Games, Social Club dir.

Here are closer steps for installation:


FOR EVERYONE WITH PROBLEM ""SELECT PROFILE"" and ""PROFILES FOUND 0"" :
FOR EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO PLAY GAME IN OFFLINE MODE (without profile)

1.before installing :
   *in control panel - choose WINDOWS FIREWALL [turn that program off(easier solution) , or turn off/block only max payne in that program]
   *turn off your antivirus 
2.install game
3.after installation, ABORT the window which asks about updates (click cancel)
4.OPEN CD4 - go to ""crack"" , open ""UPDATES"" and install 3 icons
5.COPY folder ""PROFILES"" from CD4 / crack - go to Documents/Rockstar Games and paste that folder in ""Max Payne 3"" and ""Social club""
6.COPY everything from crack (CD4) and paste to folder where you installed game (for example: C:/Program files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3)
7.Disconnect from internet , open game and choose OFFLINE MODE
8.Play the game

P.s   After you have done all these steps:
      -You can TURN ON FIREWALL and ANTIVIRUS
      -While you are in the game, you can connect on the internet and use it"

TESTED Windows 7 Proffesional 64 bit
works perfect.


1. Burn or mount the image (I used the new Daemon tools v4.45.4.0315 to mount the image)

2. Install the game. When it tries to get updates after install, abort.
Then install the required game updates found in the CrackUpdates dir on
DVD4 
1a: First Launcher Social Club v.1.09.5
1b: Then MP3 Patch Update v.1.0.0.17
1c: Then MP3 Laucher v.1.13.0.0

3. Copy over the cracked files,from the Crack dir on DVD4 to your installation dir
3a: (MaxPayne3.exe, gsrid.dll, binkw32.dll)

4. Copy over the DLC folder,from the Crack dir on DVD4 to your installation dir
dir on DVD4 to your installation dir.

5 make shortcut from the PlayMaxPayne3.exe in the game dir.
rightclick on it and choose copy to.
then choose desktop.

6.Run the game once ,so a folder will be automaticly created in documents.
then leave the game and continue with step 7.

7. Copy over the ""profiles"" dir, also found on DVD4 to
you User/Documents/RockstarGames/Social Club dir.

8. Play the game offline. Make sure that all the games exe files are blocked
from going online by using your system or third party firewall to prevent
outgoing connections on every game exe file. Do this before starting the
game. Going online and using your own profile might be possible, but it
is at your own risk.

9. wait for the long intro video ,then you can set your graphics resolution, brightness in the Game menu. "

,paulchents,2012-07-07T15:09Z,"for those who cant get it work cos there is no profile. here's how i did it!

just go to system security in control panel, then go firewall, then advance setting, then outbound rules, then click new.... there are three files u need to block
1) maxpayne3.exe (under programfiles(x86)?>rockstar games>max payne 3
2) playmaxpayne3.exe
3) renderer.exe (under programfiles(x86)>rockstar games>social club

just click next to block them and give them a name and click finish, once all 3 of these files has been block, try to follow all the steps and redo it, copy crack, do the patch and etc.

when is all done, voila you now have a profile and it jump straight to the game once u start it :) hope this helps 

cheers and tpb rules!"

1) No Social Club folder is created in the Documents/Rockstar Directory so I'm unable to complete the step requiring me to copy the Crack/Profile directory.
2) Attempting to Play in offline mode leads me to nothing but a black screen, and when I ctrl+alt+dlt it shows that the program is simply unresponsive and requires the process to be ended.

This is by far not my first torrent with a crack, I've been at this for years, I can also read and follow instructions so any help at this point would be greatly appreciated seeing as how I'm not the only one with this problem."

Apply the settings and do not hit any keys while waiting upwards to a minute. As soon as the screen shows up again confirm that you want to keep the settings. If it doesn't work it will revert to the settings before you changed anything. Then do the same thing for your resolution.

,Ezoh,2012-07-22T17:53Z,"THE ULTIMATE FIX TO PROFILE / LOADING SCREEN PROBLEM

1.  Install Game DVD1 -> DVD2 -> DVD3 -> DVD4 (cancel update at end of installation)

2.  Unplug Internet Cable!

3.  Go to DVD4 CRACK directory in mounted dvd!  Install   updates (patch 1.0.17, MP3 Launcher, Social Club).  COPY EVERYTHING EXCEPT PROFILES to Max Payne 3 Directory!

4.  Launch Max Payne 3 Launcher, Play Offline start game!

5.  Alt + Tab out and go to  C:/USERS/*YOUR USERNAME*/MY DOCUMENTS/ROCKSTAR GAMES/SOCIAL CLUB and paste profiles folder from DVD4 CRACK directory! 

6.  Alt + Tab back into game and log in! After LOGIN Loading is done and game starts!

IMPORTANT INFO!!

You have to do it exactly in this order or it will not work! You have to start game before you copy profiles or it will say INVALID USERNAME!

ENJOY! Works WIN7x64!"

He's not your personal game reviewer. The guy's probably busy, hell, i'm not even half as busy as i'm sure he is and there's no way i could make the time to play every fucking game that gets released, then immediately make, edit, and upload a video review... do you have any idea how much time that must take? Factoring in that i'm sure Joe has a life, too. Give the guy a break."

Wow, what a dipshit, lowlife, ungrateful comment. Lazy crackers? The irony in your ignorant, retarded reply is of epic proportions. How many games have you cracked and posted on TPB? I'm guessing it's fucking ZERO. How many games has your lazy, cheap, pathetic ass downloaded and enjoyed at other's expence? I'm guessing countless. So fuck off and die you idiotic piece of shit.

I had absolutley no problems downloading, installing, playing and finishing this awesome game/crack. Apparently it's you that the fucking lazy retard. Silly bitch."

THIS solved the problem for me at least... as after starting the game i noticed that i had a new folder named cache and some differens in files(the profile called crack which were added as said) names and dates to running the game... solution for me could be that the game couldnt run properly as it didnt have authoroties to edit files or add a cache folder before starting the game... this did work anyhow for me... just as a comment... dont know if it will fix any1 elses problems if they cannot get the game worning, be sure to listen carefully on what explainers try to help you with before complaining..."

,L4Z3R37H,2012-07-28T19:45Z,"For all those using Utorrent to DL. I figured out the fastest way to get your grubby dick beaters on a copy of this torrent.

1. stop fucking with the preferences. Get a fresh copy of Utorrent and leave the default settings alone you greedy bastards. You only need to run the setup guide. 

2. Do not hit and run. 

3. Most importantly, your DL/UL ratio is only as good as your ISP provides. I pay for 25DL/25UL and my MAX DL is 3.2MB/s and upload is ~1.1MB/s at default Utorrent settings.

and i asked a lot of my friends and no one knows how to do so.
when i try to play they ask me to login and then give them a code...
so ill be very happy if you can tell me how to do the offline mode thing you said on step 6!
Thanks!"

I did all the things IN ORDER,made the 3 firewall disables,in addition my net was disconnected from the installation...I ran the patches,Copied the whole crack dir from disc 4..copied the profile,ran it in offline,but after i press ok the loading screen comes,freezes,cuz i cant login to profile,however it is set to autoconnect..Nevermind i press home go to sign in tab there is the profile,i click on it and it says cannot find username or invalid password..So i really dont know what to do now..Please help,I've been fucking with this game all day long,Thanks Guys"
,sbjaved,2012-08-17T21:01Z,Tried all the steps twice with exe files blocked in firewall. No can do. Game crashes immediately when loaded.
,sbjaved,2012-08-17T22:21Z,"ok... for all having problems... try running in game in SAFE MODE (not windows safe mode, but the game has a safe mode option itself)... and set the directx to ver 9 in the graphics settings. its working in dx9...although this is weird bcz my gfx card supports dx11 but it crashes immediatley if i change to 11."
,sbjaved,2012-08-18T01:39Z,"in my particular case, the game doesn't recognize that i have 2 gpu's in my laptop...it just recognizes the intel gpu while ignoring the nvidia gt540m. thats why switching from dx11 to dx9 fixes the issue. however i've tried many workarounds to force the game to use nvidia gpu including commandline switches but it just wont work...however there are youtube vids of the game running on gt540m w/ dx11...anybody has any ideas???"

Make sure that all the games exe files are blocked
from going online by using your system or third party firewall to prevent
outgoing connections on every game exe file. Do this before starting the
game.

Why we need to block the files ? 
It's just ax Payne files or all my games files ?

,rockerz69,2012-08-19T21:15Z,"INSTALL AND THE GAME WORKS PERFECT AND I A M IN THE 3RD CHAPTER NOW.THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD..:)
At first i also got the loading error but then i figures it out.
*Here are some tips that helped me to pass the loading screen.
1.after u installed the game by disabling the firewall and the antivirus a window will pop out to update the the patches after the installation is complete u don't need to update the patches to play this game in offline so close it immediately.
2.then u will install the the files in the update folder as told in the description.
3.then u have to copy the 'profiles' folder to the social club which is in the user's documents folder not to the one which is in the program files.(read the description carefully.Of-course there are some videos in YouTube which tells you to copy the profiles folder to the program file folder but i don't know that it works or not but in the description it is told that to copy it to the one in the user document folder and that's what i did)   
3.then u will copy the remaining 4 files in the crack folder to your installation directory and replace them and don't open the game.
4.u have to block some files (i listed the files in the 5th step) using the windows firewall (http://www.trishtech.com/win7/block_a_program_in_windows_firewall.php) or u can also use other antivirus  firewall.
5.so here are the files i blocked from internet for playing the game
i.PlayMaxPayne3.exe in the Max Payne 3 folder
ii.MaxPayne3.exe in the same folder above.
iii.renderer.exe in the Social Club folder
iv.uninstallRGSCRedistributable.exe in the Social Club folder
v.wow_helper.exe  in the Social Club folder
now the game must pass the loading screen here.
6.if u started the game before blocking these files and blocked them after then u have to restart your pc to pass the loading screen [this where i got stuck for hours.so i unblocked them and restarted my pc and blocked them again then started the games then it worked..:)]
7.BTW if u enabled your antivirus after restating the pc it will show u that ""gsrld.dll"" is a threat file so disable the antivirus or that file to the white list in your antivirus before u restart your u r pc.
hope it solves your problem.thank you..:)"

If you own an ASUS card (ATi or NV) and you installed the 'Smart Doctor' and/or 'ASUS Gamer' software, try removing them.

 All you need to do is uninstall Smart Doctor and ASUS Gamer, restart your computer and reinstall your video card drivers (Though when I tried the last step it just said my drivers are up to date.)

I found this suggestion on the Battlefield 3 troubleshooting page on PC Gaming Wiki. But it fixed my problems with Max Payne 3 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution as well.

,Trogdor8freebird,2012-09-17T21:01Z,"I'm going to tell you all like it is with this torrent.
Both, the people torrenting and the people who cracked this have reason to be upset at one another.

Extremezone, thank you for making this available to everyone. You guys did great when cracking this game, it works perfectly if you do the steps perfectly. That part of it is definitely true.

But I have downloaded and installed literally hundreds of games, and the most pain in the ass game I've ever had to get working was this one. It has nothing to do with the actual process or how easy it is to get it to working - it's the fact that you guys made a step-by-step guide that's simply bad.

If you guys are having problems, these are the three most likely solutions:

1) If you can't copy the ""updates"" folder from the cracked files to the documents>rockstar games>social club because it's not there, then simply play the game once and it will be there. You don't have to actually play the game, just get to the title screen and alt+F4 if you have to.

2) If you can't figure out how to play in offline mode, it's very simple. Disconnect your internet (In any way possible, disconnecting the router, or just the ethernet cable...) and open up ""PlayMaxPayne3.exe"". From there it will give you an option to play in offline mode. Choose it.

3) This is the one I had a pain in the ass time with. 
This is how you have to use the updates folder from the crack:
-Update from the cracked folder FIRST. Don't copy everything first, then update. Update first.
-Then copy everything from there to the main directory.
-Finally, once you play (or just get to the title screen using offline mode) then copy the updates folder to documents>rockstar games>social club

Overall:
Extremezone, thank you for the game. You guys deserve more positive feedback, but you deserve some of the negative feedback though for making a step-by-step guide that's not specific enough for even the more experienced people."
