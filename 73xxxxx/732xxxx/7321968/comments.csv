[T],Pylypas_von_Kanapes,2012-06-02T14:47Z,"The album is a partially self release recording by famous Lithuanian Jew’s-harpers. Maybe it is not the bigest masterstroke of Jew’s-harp play in the world, but performing is really highly skilled and all tracks are worth for listening. The most tracks are original compositions but all album is shot by spirituality of ancient musical tradition, tribute to folklore is clearly perceptible, some rare traditional instrument are used together with Jew’s-harps and Track 02 is rearranged famous lithuanian folk song. This album should became favorite recording for fans of non-commersial alternative music, music with etnic roots and shamanic sounds.
The creators of this work is real enthusiasts of harping, maybe the most prominent Jew’s-harpers in Lithuania. Albertas Bartasius also is a good craftsman of Jew’s-harps. You can visit his blog at: http://pilietis.blogas.lt/ (page in Lithuanian) or even buy his quality made Jew’s-harps (dambrelis[et]gmail.com; rutabartasiute[et]gmail.com)."
