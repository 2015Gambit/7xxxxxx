Takes 1:35 for the cam guy to get it pointed at screen, lol.
But it's good audio and video.
Only problem is that maybe 20% of the screen is is cut back around the edges.

Overall good enough job, and thank god I didn't have to pay and put money in the pockets of the evil Hollywood Jews that bankroll stinker bomb films like this."
