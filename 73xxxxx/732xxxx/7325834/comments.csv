,Albertino5,2012-06-04T19:18Z,"This is a translation of the Spanish version isn't it? For some reason, although the Encore thing ended up saying I had some 37 000 hours left it still insisted that it required the royalty-bearing serial number. 

The patch that's supposed to substitute for the above won't allow me to paste or open it: It says I don't have permission from.....myself! (Windows 7).
Haven't found a way around it yet."
,Albertino5,2012-06-04T19:38Z,Did you just eliminate my comment!?
,Albertino5,2012-06-04T19:39Z,"Damn, you didn't. It just disappeared and reappeared, forget about that! :)"
,funerus,2012-06-04T21:53Z,"In your textfile about missing Premiere pro content you say:
""Follow this steps only if you are 100% sure that Premier Pro is missing content!""

Could you mr Angrtak (or someone else) please try to explain what this content actually is, so this is possible to find out about?"
,Angertek,2012-06-04T22:34Z,"If you are not sure just install the content anyways i said that because i don't want you to have to go through the entire process again of installing premier pro if you mess up while installing the extra content. So i said that because if you know that you specifically need to use this presets you would look for them. But if you don't know you won't need them. So yeah you can install them if you want. It should not affect your installation at all. Just ignore what i said there, again it was to save you time in case you messed up and had to re install everything again, since the presets might not be neccesary depending on what you are using premier pro for"
,Angertek,2012-06-04T22:38Z,"Albertino5 did you try the update? If yes, try using the patch again and replacing the .dll again. Yes it is  PART of the Spanish version translated combined with a better explanation and how to get it with the new update without having to go through inserting the serial a bunch of times. So again the update would help you for sure and deleting all the files mention in the instructions. If it still didn't work please comment again. I want to help you get it fixed"
,Angertek,2012-06-04T22:49Z,"Lol no way! it happened to me too. Disappeared and then reappeared. 

- NOTICE*: I am not responsible for ghost comments!"
,Albertino5,2012-06-04T23:23Z,"Thanks Angertek! (Imagine these were our real names!:)) I've finally figured out what that update is I think, and am downloading it. 

The problem I had with the patcher is I could neither paste nor run it, Windows 7 suggesting I might not have permissions (essentially permissions from myself), but maybe with this update I won't need to use the patcher? Thanks a lot again."
,funerus,2012-06-05T00:37Z,"Hey Angertek, thaks for you upload and the reply about the Premiere Pro content.

The thing is that this assittional content seems to have nothing to do with the missed presets and codecs. These are in the intalled folder all of them, it seems. But they are not avalable in the application.

The additional content from thethingy is a large update of some kind from Adobe, as it seems, of more than 700 MB, and obviously about other feature. I so far not have found out what actually is. 
Neither this nor the update to CS 6.0.1 does anything with the missing presets and codecs. At least not on my computer....

Anyway, Premiere Pro CS6 works well with dslr-files by using the feature ""New sequence from clip"", but will probably work better with the right codecs that will be available with the missing prsets activated.

Thanks again, we appreciate very much that you folks do something to make these applications available for people like me who can't afford to pay Adobes ridicolous prizes."
,tomh1,2012-06-05T03:32Z,DOES NOT WORK. fuking hopeless torrents waste of time
,Angertek,2012-06-05T18:48Z,"Tomh1, Again instead of saying it doesn't work why don't you explain your problem like everyone else. "
,Angertek,2012-06-05T18:51Z,"funerus the stuff you are talking about is neither wiht the crack version nor with the full version. Because i have tested the full version and is exactly same thing plus the stuff provided by [thethingy]. So if it is missing something, is not the crack, is the program it self and i think if you search for it you might find the answer to the question in the adobe forums. trust me i have the full version bought of the master collection and i can assure you there is no difference what so ever"
,Angertek,2012-06-05T19:20Z,"Also, i cant help you if you just comment a complain. You have to explain your problem i cannot guess which computer you have, and how you are installing it. I dont't do magic, no one does magic all the uploads by everyone are based on cracks that should work on every standard computer. One specific case might have a variation. Not even the best crackers "" Razor, thethingy, Chichu, MAFIAA "" they cannot make a crack that will work for all specific cases there are always exceptions. SO unless you explain what your problem is you are hopeless.. Now i suggest to explain your problem and maybe i can help."
,Angertek,2012-06-05T19:24Z,"And stop saying is a lie, at least i tried and it worked for some people..."
,Albertino5,2012-06-06T00:37Z,Hi again Angertek. I think I'll need to try again at some point but I'm not sure what I have to undo: Is it necessary to uninstall and reinstall everything? I might not have kept full track of which .dlls are the cracked ones and which the original...so maybe yes! Thanks.
,Albertino5,2012-06-09T20:35Z,"I want to clarify this:

Whenever I click on ""adobe.cs6.all.products.activator.(x32.y.x64)_up01-MPT.exe"" I get the message:

""Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""

This also happens when I try to paste it into the relevant programme folder following the instructions here."
,Albertino5,2012-06-10T00:38Z,"OK!!

I've figured out that was because of my Mcaffee antivirus! I switched it off for a few minutes and the problem ceased!

It does look like I've installed the whole thing now, finally! Including Premiere presets!

Muchisimas gracias and good luck to all!"
,freakyys,2012-06-15T18:49Z,"Hey, Im trying to fix Adobe Encore, but I get stuck at the step where you need to put in the serials. The problem I have is that after 8 times of putting them in I still get an error message at startup, saying not royalized key. The thing I noticed that's different from the guy in the video is that I always get the adobe agreement the first time when the SLStore stuff is deleted and the SLcache is deleted. After agreeing I need to input a serial just like the installer for cs6. That's only the first time I execute the program when that windows comes up.Then when the program is loading I get the error message and it's asking for a serial code directly and I use the first code in the instructions. I then close the program and the validation window comes up before the program, when I open it the second time. I activate it offline and then a serial window comes up and I input the second serial. Then if I continue like that it just lopps around and the error message never disappears, unless I validate one of the validation pop-ups. The process then stops and no more pop-ups come up except for the error message 

Does anyone know a solution to this?"
,Angertek,2012-06-15T19:39Z,"Yes, first download update and install update for encore. Then after that replace the .dll again and open encore. Make sure the patcher is in the encore directory and that you ran it as administrator, just to male sure try running it again. After that open encore if the message error still pop-up i suggest re installing...encore only. If encores opens up the error doesnt pop up but its asking you for a serial, just simply close the window aND RUN THE ADOBE tool from [thethingy]"
,freakyys,2012-06-15T23:41Z,"Ok it works, used another method in validating the encore. Anyway it seems like the encore library doesnt include anything. is it suppose to be like that or is like that for everyone else here or?"
,king-kam,2012-06-16T22:39Z,I don't understand step 6 and 7 of the how to make it work guide 
,snaabit,2012-06-19T01:27Z,"This is a crappy with to a crappy torrent.
Doesn't work, and even if it did the method is insanely weird."
,Angertek,2012-06-19T22:25Z,"snaabit, i don't see how you find it weird and rather than complaining why don't you explain your problem... Maybe the solution is already in the comments. Also you need to understand that i'm just trying to help you if you don't cooperate and just make hater comments... then why don't you go and buy it and you will see that the paid, serious support from adobe is horrible and their methods are, also, ""insanely weird"" just like you said. "
,misteryam,2012-06-27T04:28Z,I'm unclear what to do with the second part of Step 6 and also step 7.  Pleas ehelp
,Angertek,2012-07-05T04:22Z,"@mysterian replace the file and input the key when prompted to do so, after opening encore, a few times. Then Makesure you install the update or have it installed the latest update which you can download from adobe website free to download
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=5406
Then continue with he instructions. ALso watch the video if you are having problem specifically with the directories."
,wheresmyjello,2012-07-20T06:47Z,"hey, i cant do step 1 haha, you said download it but which link is the download u want? if I try and click file 1 for premier pro CS6 i get an error message when trying to open the .exe please help."

,passion4722,2012-07-26T22:11Z,"HI Angertek, I am lost after deleting the SL Cache files.  Your instructions no. 6 and 7 don't make sense at all.  Could you please write clearly what exactly we have to delete and copy etc.  For eg. in instruction #6 what does ""....BAK"" mean? What do you mean by replacement?  Replace what with what? Please make the points clear so that I can fix this Adobe Encore problem.
Thanks. "
,Angertek,2012-07-28T05:12Z,sorry about you guys not understanding 6 and 7 i will post  a comment soon with the instructions rewritten all over i will thoroughly analyse them and try to make them as clear as possible. Give me a day. Sorry and Thank you for patience

Here you go

MISSING PREMIERE CS6 PRESET / CODEC PROBLEM SOLVED /////


This solution worked for me, I can't promise it will work for everyone.. try it out guys:

1) Uninstall Premiere CS6
2) Reinstall Premiere CS6
3) Open Premiere once and click 'continue trial', then close the program.
4) Delete the file: ' /program files (x86)/common files/adobe/adobe pcd/cache/cache.db'
5) Apply the cracked .dll file




Premiere Pro Error: ""Unable to find compatible video modules"" 
(If you have AMD HD Graphics)
1. Go to the Catalyst Control Center Application
2. Click ""Power""
3. Click ""Switchable Graphics""
4. Set everything to ""High Performance""
5. ""gpusniffer.exe"" is Premiere Pro, set it to 
""High Performance""
6. Check the box that says ""Show a pop-up 
warning for unassigned applications"".

*Premiere Pro & Encore both require 3D graphics and won't run without them. 
I thought that my Premiere Pro and Encore weren't cracked properly, then I did this and both work no problem (Encore was freezing after I selected New Project).

Thank you to all the people who contributed to this.Thank you!

The problem is, that I have gotten CS6 to install fine, but I get the Encore royalty serial number error.

Can you *PLEASE* provide a detail list on what to do from start to finish to install the entire CS6 package and get Encore to work?  I see several posts in different downloads and not sure where to start first.  I created a system image that I can restore from each time it doesn't work that completely has Adobe removed - so It is like I'm starting from scratch.

Again - Can you please provide the correct download and full steps from scratch?  "

This time Encore should work. 
If it doesn't Please refer to other solutions. We are very Sorry

					by L0VI

Extra: ( simple explanations ) We repeat the activation various times 

so that Encore can keep record of multiple activations and thus at 

the end have a series of days of activation accumulated this means 

that encore might not work forever but it should last more than a 

year. Updating it might help make it last longer. If it stops working 

after a while unistall and please repeat all proccess from the 

begginging.  You might also want to try after doing this coping the patcher to the Encore directory running it and trying step 9 and all of its parts again.
				I hope you enjoy.
