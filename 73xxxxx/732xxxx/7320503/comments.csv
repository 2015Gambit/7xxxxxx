http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7313983/MAX_PAYNE_3_-_RETAIL_DVD_-_MULTI_10_-_PC

1. Burn or mount the image.

1.1 OPTIONAL: not sure if needed. If you have already installed the game, uninstall it. 
also delete registry files (run->regedit->search for “max payne” & “rockstar games social club”)

2. Install the game. When it tries to get updates after install, abort.
Then install the required game updates found in the 
""Updates"" folder of the torrent (Launcher, Social Club, MP3 main game).

3. Copy over the ""profiles"" folder to
your DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club folder.
(**USER**/Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club).

4. Copy over the cracked content, ie. the rest of the files, to the main Max Payne 3 folder

5. Play the game offline. Make sure that all the games exe files are blocked
from going online by using your system or third party firewall to prevent
outgoing connections on every game exe file. Do this before starting the
game. Going online and using your own profile might be possible, but it
is at your own risk."
,perezbros,2012-06-03T15:05Z,i was stuck on the loading screen after trying a different crack but I followed Psycho Bobs instructions and the game is working now so far. 
,leonnews,2012-06-03T19:53Z,"physco bob I can't thank you enough, do you know how many hours I wasted with that other crap? This crack works a treat and your instructions were spot on. Muchos Gracia Bro!!!"
,berserkers,2012-06-03T20:15Z,"Same as sycho , worked with the download he left a link for .

I applied the crack i got with my download first and when i got ""license corrupt"" after starting the game , i downloaded this crack and applied it ( not the dlc folder tho ) without deleting anything from the previous one .

Like he said , don t let the game update itself once it s finished installing ."
,shoppy22,2012-06-03T20:53Z,"@psycho_bob

i was hoping ur way would work..but it didnot for me..any reloaded crack folder gives me restart pc as soon as I just select the folder..revolt does not help me bypass loading screen..

how do I play..pls tell me"
,leonnews,2012-06-04T00:45Z,"@shoppy22 . Try doing a clean un-install first like Physco Bob says. But be careful if you're going to delete files from registry. Then restart and install the game again starting from fresh.

That's what I did and Psyco and I both downloaded the same game from here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7313983/MAX_PAYNE_3_-_RETAIL_DVD_-_MULTI_10_-_PC

Different games need different cracks it seems."
,shoppy22,2012-06-04T05:02Z,"@leonnews

same here..I too downloaded the Multi 10 retail ver.
but I dont know what is wrong.I reinstalled the game but still gsrld.dll kept my pc crashing as soon as I touched the freaking folder..when I gain uninstalled the game I could open the crack folder though..so what I did was,copied everything else except gsrd.dll into another folder,again installed,this time used the crack without gsrld.dll..dint work,used just the ""profiles"" from the folder and the rest from REVOLT crack..still dint work..created exclusion for gsrld.dll in my Kaspersky 2012.

,DamianHoward,2012-06-04T15:43Z,"Can someone help me? I've installed the game and followed ""psycho_bob's"" instructions on how to install the updates and crack. I've loaded the game up and I'm stuck at the Max Payne 3 black loading screen.. It just keeps saying ""Loading..."" at the bottom of the screen.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks :-)"
,cheeseandgravy,2012-06-04T19:02Z,"I got the solution for those who got stucked by loading screen. You have to press Home on your keyboard to sign in to Rockstar Games Social Club. There is a profile by default that has a female avatar on it. You have to choose that profile. 

Creating a Social Club is optional, but that's what I did anyway. After you got signed by either accounts. You can play the game.

HOPE THIS HELPS"

Works with RELOADED release after I already applied REALOADED's Updates, profile, dlc and Crack. I had already start playing the game too and I have no problem. I play offline and stay offline while playing.

1. Install the patch MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22
2. Copy over the contents of the /Crack dir to your installation
directory

NOTES

* This release does not include any previous patches, thus should be used only after v1.0.0.17 patch is installed.

CHANGELOG

* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodgeï¿½. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu).
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu.
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available. Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards). "

,pirateGRC,2012-06-08T05:17Z,"RELOADED Update v1.0.0.22: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED

You have to apply the first REALOADED Updates, Crack, dlc and profiles that can be found seperately here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED works with Retail Version as well.

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the nstructions from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)
