Director Phil St. John's "Taggers" concerns the initiation rites of a group of spray-painting dudes. Don't worry, they aren't menacing. They don't scrawl anything dirtier than their tagger names on walls that already look slated for demolition. They may look like ruffians that would have old ladies walking on the other side of the street, but underneath the floppy clothing, they are able talented performers. Mr. St. John, always with an eye to the luscious youthful types, has assembled a wowing cast for this funky little flick.
