I wasn't sure if this should be listed under TV SHOWS or MUSIC VIDEOS.  

New Music Live is a daily (weekday) TV show on MuchMusic (Canada).   Therefore I went with the TV SHOWS category.

On May 31 2012, New Music Live aired a ONE DIRECTION special, and called it ONE DAY WITH ONE DIRECTION. I have no clue what day it was actually filmed, but it aired on May 31, 2012. Lengthy interview and chit-chat, and a few videos. Lots of fans shown as well.

I'm not a One Direction fan.. but decided to share it for all the girls and gay boys out there who are currently in love with them. :) I doubt this special has aired outside of Canada, so here it is in high quality for the world to see.

If there's a kid in your life who loves ONE DIRECTION, you should absolutely download this for them!
