The only other one I know is LoriJoGH @ YouTube (I download from her for myself) and she wants her videos to stay there. It's possible to download her videos by using keepvidDOTcom: all you have to do is copy the url of the video (right click/copy link location in firefox), paste it at keepvid website, click download, accept to run the java application and then you click on Download MP4 (Max 480p) or Download MP4 (720p)."
