===========================================
Confused on the Controls? I was too so here is a little something.

WHEN IN GAME:
----------
D-Pad: Move (No Dual Analog support unfortunately...)

Start: Pause Game

Select: Codec (Sort of like an in-game cell phone...but older and apparently has             facetime)

HOME: Option menu (NOT for the game!)

Square: With Nothing: Choke hold thingy / With Weapon: Shoot / When in "Corner Mode" Knock on wall.

X: Duck / Also applies when attached to a wall
Triangle: First Person perspective (Can't move in this mode)

Circle: Punch and Kick (Press Repeatedly)
--------------------------
WHEN IN CODEC (if i remember correctly :3):
----------
X: Skip sentence (No more voice acting if you press this)

Cirlce: Hold to skip entire sequence (Good if you died and have to listen to the damn thing all over again)
=============================================
Also a small tip: When in an In-game cutscene don't press ANYTHING unless you want to actually skip that scene. I can't stress this enough.
=========================================================
Instructions:

Unrar (Or whatever you call it) the .Rar and take the "Metal Gear Solid" Folder and put it in your PSP's GAME Directory!
======================================

Tested on CFW 6.60 Pro-B9 PSP 2000 (Slim) and Works without issues!

Enjoy and Seed!
