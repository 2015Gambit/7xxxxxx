Most medical doctors are not aware of this information and its implications for prevention and treatment. If we need more evidence that our current policy on cannabis is counterproductive and foolish, here it is. An excellent film. ""

""A hugely important film.""

""What If Cannabis Cured Cancer brings to light a host of recent findings that have potentially game-changing implications for the future of marijuana as a medicine. A must-see film.""
