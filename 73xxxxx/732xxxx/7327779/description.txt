What if Cannabis cures cancer?


 Could the chemicals found in marijuana prevent and even heal several deadly cancers? Could the tumor-regulating properties of cannabinoids┬¥ someday replace the debilitating drugs, chemotherapy, and radiation that harms as often as it heals?
     Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries in this feature-length documentary.
     Using original and archival footage, the film presents controversial but highly convincing evidence that this forbidden herb has healing properties beyond any other plant on the planet interacting as it does with the bodys own endocannabinoid system┬¥ to keep us fit and disease-free.
     What if Cannabis Cured Cancer┬¥ explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies, and when pot is consumed, the ┼ôendocannabinoids┬¥ inside us along with any cannabinoids we ingest fit together like a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the bodys healthy cells.
     Like the old parable of the beggar who was sitting on a treasure chest but never bothered to look inside, governments and the medical establishment have been slow to realize the miraculous anti-cancer properties of marijuana. Finally, in this extraordinary documentary, the truth comes out.
