,Theuzzzzz,2012-06-03T05:05Z,"@wielku
If you read the description ""If you like these games, I suggest you donate to the website as it supports charity and you can choose how much of your money goes where."" Maybe you'd think twice about calling me an ""ice hole"""
,Theuzzzzz,2012-06-03T05:06Z,and you wouldn't get Bastion for 10 cents
,Pe4enie,2012-06-03T17:41Z,"Guys, seed please. I downloaded only 1 Gb and uploaded 5.5 Gb already -_-"
,Keshie,2012-06-04T05:03Z,"HEY! 
Enough whining about Humble Indie Bundle being on Pirate Bay. Pirate Bay is about sharing and getting things free. Not everyone can share, or afford to buy, or be permitted by their government to buy in the first place.

If you have a problem with this, please donate $1 or â&#x201A;Ź1 to H.I.B. You don't even need to download. The money goes to charity and to help game devs. I have, and I bought the games for friends too.

Otherwise, please just shut up and seed, OK?"
,Pe4enie,2012-06-04T20:16Z,"+over9000.
downloaded/seeded - 2.24Gb/18.7Gb already -_-"
