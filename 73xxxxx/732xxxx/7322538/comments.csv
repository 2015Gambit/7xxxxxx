,projectmaria,2012-06-04T16:54Z,"i don't know if it's just me but Acrobat is not working well.
here's what i did:
> install the replace the amtlib.dll (32bit) then run the app - did not work
> restore the original dll then run - worked as trial
> replace again the original dll - worked but after restarting the pc, again, it didn't work..."
,Angertek,2012-06-04T22:41Z,"If acrobat is not working don't install it. or delete the folder and download this... http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6955640/ADOBE_ACROBAT_X_(10.1.2)_PRO_[thethingy]_

It's a fast download and fully working. Sorry about that i totally forgot about acrobat!"
,Angertek,2012-06-04T22:42Z,"remenber acrobat hasn't changed to a new version it's part of the pack, but is the same program from when cs5.1 was released . No changes"
,Jaydagod,2012-06-05T06:30Z,"YAY,HAPPY DAYS! This Works!! great job"
,Op2mus,2012-06-08T08:24Z,How can this be a full install of CS6 when the file size is only ~715mb and all the other torrents for CS6 are like 8gbs?  Am I missing something here? Is this extensions or plugins for CS6?  Thanks.
,Angertek,2012-06-10T17:10Z,"Op2mus. Always read the description. It says "" - faster Downloads than torrent using http://prodesigntools.com "". The torrent it self is only the cracked files, the extra content you'll need for premier pro and the instructions"
,kgill113z,2012-06-12T08:47Z,Premiere Pro Content thethingy isn't working. any suggestions?
,Angertek,2012-06-13T14:15Z,kgill113z. What you mean inst working? Its not supposed to work it's only a bunch of premier pro files do you have premier pro installed? If so you should be able to open the files in premier pro or use them from premier pro.
,MikeSki,2012-06-14T08:06Z,is there anyway you could come up with a keygen because i've followed step by step as  you instructed and wont work it keeps telling me i have 7 days to register... i do appreciate the hard work for the product tho 
,kgill113z,2012-06-15T14:06Z,"Yes i have Premiere Pro installed. when i export, i do not have all the formats and no where near all of the presets. In the settings where i start a new sequence, ""sequence presets"" are at bare minimum. No DSLR in editing mode."
,soonganesh,2012-06-16T12:22Z,"This is not the solution for missing presets and codecs. Theses missing stuffs are a new trick from Adobe to lock the most professional function of the software, wich are installed only with a normal registration and ID... 
I made the test installing a trial with Adobe ID, everything work perfectly without any add or update... Help!!!"
,saydaysago2008,2012-06-17T03:19Z,"MISSING PREMIERE CS6  PRESET / CODEC PROBLEM SOLVED /////


This solution worked for me, I can't promise it will work for everyone.. try it out guys:

1) Uninstall Premiere CS6
2) Reinstall Premiere CS6
3) Open Premiere once and click 'continue trial', then close the program.
4) Delete the file: ' /program files (x86)/common files/adobe/adobe pcd/cache/cache.db'
5) Apply the cracked .dll file


All presets/codecs should now be working"

Followed all instructions, still tells me that my serial number is invalid and that I have 7 days to validate!"
,tony_q,2012-06-18T23:25Z,"Nevermind, somehow, it's working now."
,se3noevil,2012-06-24T09:57Z,@saydaysago2008 It worked you are a hero!!!
,fkomlosi,2012-06-25T17:40Z,"@Angertek, thanks for the comprehensive instructions. I followed everything as in txt, but when starting Encore, the same ""cannot start in non-royalty..."" message comes up. Any ideas?"
,franglais,2012-06-28T14:27Z,"Good deal, thanks for the tips and ""stuff"" ;-)
The direct d/l may be fast, but I've gotten spoiled with usenet speeds! "
,darkjavelan,2012-07-21T23:09Z,Hey guys don't know if this will work for you but there is a way to update all the products you download from adobe.  If you install all them as trials and use the patch crack amtlib.dll file on each trial product but the last one you will be able to update all the products at once.  After that just add the dll file to that program also.  I have noticed that there is no option to update when you add the crack dll on the last program you can update everything.  Let me know if it works for you guys.
,alikhandrosaleh,2012-07-27T17:06Z,"hi, when im using any application x32 work good but when im using the x64 the trial dialog shows and telling me that i still having 28 days ! same as when im using acrobat x pro ?

,subbyy,2012-08-05T14:22Z,"Angertek and if there are any others, I was hoping you'd be able to assist please.

I haven't been successful in getting the Premiere presets along with the DSLR presets and codecs to install.

The issue that I'm running into is I am not able to even install the software as a ""trial"" at all. The two options I get are install using a serial and the other is to try the software and enter my Adobe ID. I've tried putting in a dummy ID and it has taken it but when I start Premiere for the first time, the activation window comes up and although I can choose activate later, Premiere does NOT open after clicking on activate later.

Is there anything you can suggest to get this install process to work? For the life of me, I've tried it multiple times and am not getting the same results you are.

Thank you so much for your help."
,Angertek,2012-08-06T18:38Z,"yes i can suggest  a few things for stopping the windows from popping up...

1. 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7191990/ADOBE_TOOL_v2.1_[thethingy]_

run this tool and make sure it says that everything work. Then restart replace the .dll and run premier pro you should not get a windows pop up anymore.

2.
Now for solving the problem that doesn't open
you can try first downloading the update 
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=5402

3.
If that didn't do it, ( if you are using windows ) right click on your  taskbar and click task manager, then go to services and click on the buttom in the bottom right corner of the windows "" services "" stop all adobe services and then restart and start the services again.

4.
if still doesn't open i'm afraid you'll have to re install it. ( Make sure you are clicking on the .exe file from C:/programFiles/adobe/Premier pro and not a broken shortcut, or try to run it as administrator). Please if you need further help leave another comment sorry for late response."
,Angertek,2012-08-06T18:39Z,i'm planning on making a L0VI forum so i could answer your questions faster.
,rogersarevok,2012-08-25T02:28Z,"sorry for the question, does the .dll file you are mentioning refers to amtlib.dll ???"
,Angertek,2012-08-27T18:33Z,dude wow. yes 
,fr3x,2012-09-01T21:14Z,"I was install this, and still haven't presets AVCHD in premiere. What I can do now?"
,Angertek,2012-09-06T23:42Z,"People you need to read. If you read the comments you find answer. Reading is a good thing and it's not like you are reading a book or anything. Just read the comments please.
