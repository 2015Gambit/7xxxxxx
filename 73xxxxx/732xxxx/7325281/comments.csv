,ronelryan,2012-06-30T14:45Z,i cant install it. how do you do it if its an iso file? and will it work on my dual processor??
,Malakajek,2012-07-04T01:05Z,"There is a ""hidden"" rar file with game on this iso. You might skip this ""serial bullshit"" by getting straight to its folder in autoplay/msmediaplayer/ folder in there on iso.
After unpacking rar, you just rename that .exe and .cdd files with russian cyrlica letters to like 1.exe and 1.cdd then you just run exe and install it smoothly."

,Redbrpt,2012-09-16T21:07Z,"It works, the serial is that one above and the game runs in a psp emulator java based. It's lagging here, but very playable."
