,barton101,2012-08-09T08:44Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
,EJK22,2012-08-09T20:12Z,"Yo, Dawson.

Ignore the ungrateful, house-bound wankers here. (And everywhere -- the bane of all our lives.)

Thanks for the great work."
,EJK22,2012-08-24T01:10Z,"Let's see, ZenBud's rip is 1.6 gigs. Dawson's is 4.4 gigs. And ZenBud's is better???

Man, why do we bother. . ."
