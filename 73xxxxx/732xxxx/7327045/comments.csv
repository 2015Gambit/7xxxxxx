Your previous post that was names S10E09 was a ""special"". Specials generally have their own numbering and do not increase the season's episode number count.

,digga_nigga,2012-06-04T11:35Z,"Yes, specials have their own numbering, but it's much less confusing to name the releases according to the overall episode counting than according to some peculiar countings."
,BoonesFerry,2012-06-04T12:10Z,what is much less confusing is to stick with numbering conventions that have been in use for more than a decade by scene release groups...which do not increase the episode count.

,nerdwin,2012-06-04T14:18Z,"hd later today, and head games 2012, was a cool show"
,BoonesFerry,2012-06-04T16:04Z,"thetvdb is very nice to look at and easy to navigate. however, they make up their own episode numbering shcemes....often not matching tvrage, thefutoncritic, wiki, or scene releases. There is an existing standard, one that works, and has been for over a decade. Why do some sites and people insist on mucking with the rules...if it ain broke don't fix it. Stick with the established rules and there will be no confusion. Except for those who don't bother to find out what the rules are before playing the game. 

Cheers."

,BoonesFerry,2012-06-08T00:36Z,"My apologies...for my forceful opinion.
It now apears that more than one group has decided to include the *special* as a regular episode (contrary to historical patterns) and increase the season episode count."
