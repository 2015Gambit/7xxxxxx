,urmom8me,2012-06-06T18:09Z,"Hey EZTV, any way you can get Phineas and Ferb episodes?"
,Feenixx,2012-06-12T22:10Z,"Yeah, I noticed about 2/3's of the way through that the audio was out of sync - I was playing on my PS3 via Vuze for streaming (just saying, since I've noticed sync problems sometimes playing on my PS3 that aren't there in VLC on my Mac). 

Not HORRIBLY out of sync, but enough to be annoying. Thanks for the upload anyway! I've gotten enough quality videos from you that one or two bad apples aren't going to turn me away. "
