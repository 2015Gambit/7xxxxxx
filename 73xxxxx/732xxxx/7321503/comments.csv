 Below this comment, may exist spoilers. We have a disrespectful human being called @mentallyours.
 You don't read under any circumstances his comment if you don't want to know the score of the game! "
,mentallyours,2012-06-02T11:21Z,"Kevin Garnett dominated down low with 24 points and 11 rebounds as the Boston Celtics cruised in the second half to a 101-91 win over the Miami Heat in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals. With the victory, Boston now trails Miami 2-1 in the best-of-seven-series. LeBron James had 34 points to help keep the Heat competitive throughout the contest, but the Celtics had their way with Miami for the majority of the final three quarters on both ends. Balanced scoring from Garnett, Rajon Rondo, (21 points, 10 assists) and Paul Pierce (23 points) keyed the Celtics' interior attack that allowed the hosts to build a 24-point lead in the third quarter and never look back. Dwyane Wade added 18 points for Miami, helping them close the deficit to eight points in the fourth quarter but it was too little too late for the visitors"
,jessie.p.johnson,2012-06-02T16:29Z,"Nepotu, thank you.  But please stop referring to mentallyours as a human being. It's insulting to the rest of us ;)

Maybe you should try calling him ""gay"". That's what he keeps calling others.  Hahaha.  I remember when I was still in high school like him and called people gay to insult them.  Ah, well, we can't ban him so I guess we just have to tolerate him.  That's what grown-ups do.  We accept people for who they are.

Someday, he'll realize what he's doing accomplishes nothing.  250 people so far (not including the hit and runners) have downloaded or are downloading and no one has complained.  

Hey mentallyours, I'm sure you are a fine person, we know you have problems.  On behalf of everyone, I'm sorry for anything hurtful we may have said that made you cry.  I imagine it's touch not having friends.  Don't worry, I'm sure your life will get better.

I'm sure your high school has a guidance counsellor.  Why don't you make an appointment and he'll rub your belly and tell you everything will be okay for you.

Enjoy the rest of the post-season and don't stop leaving comments, I mean, if that's something you want to continue doing :).  We won't ignore you, sorry if I threatened that earlier.  Occasionally, we'll post something back at you, just to make you feel like you matter.

Smile, mentallyours, and have a wonderful day :)"

[V],Nepotu,2012-06-03T00:37Z,"If I wouldn't cared about you, people, I wouldn't referred to him at all. If everyone would ignore him, someday he would get bored. Hey, MikeyMetal! Why do you continue to read his comments? What do you expect to find? Something enlightening? :))))"
,jessie.p.johnson,2012-06-03T01:34Z,"In all seriousness, Nepotu, it's smart and considerate for you to put that spoiler warning there for newcomers.  Good idea.
