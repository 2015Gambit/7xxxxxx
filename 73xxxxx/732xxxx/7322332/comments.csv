[V],psspss,2012-06-03T05:12Z,what do you think of the blue spheres that landed in UK yards this year
[V],psspss,2012-06-03T05:20Z,"how come i never get anything like that in my yard :(( not fair.. wonder if any sold them on ebay.. lol 

prob someones joke.. made some plastic or jelly spheres and put them in a wire bag and launched on a helium balloon knowing the balloon pop and
drop them randomly no doubt.. but if they from
natural weather or tornado or outer space be even more cool"
,fellmann,2012-06-04T19:53Z,Do you have any more from this years UFO Congress ?
[V],psspss,2012-06-05T02:31Z,"
nope.. seems congress have clamped down on leaks
due to copyright or copyBS law

seems they want to make big money from the video speeches rather then get the word out??

they even sued a woman speaker for releasing her own speech from the congress 2012
and wasnt allowed to post it to her own website either"
,fellmann,2012-06-07T15:25Z,"haha.. yes.. some of them have forgotten what its all about. As an example, Project Camelot & Avalon, hardly any interviews anymore, but Kerry is asking constantly for donations, and charging for many other things. Money money money..

I usually stick with Veritas radio & Red Ice Radio these days although the secong hour interview isnt free, i subscribe 3 months for lousy â&#x201A;Ź15, and i really get value for it.

I have 2011 UFO congress on video, it was really good, and had hoped for more.

Thanks for upload"
