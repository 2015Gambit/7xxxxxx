MUFON Presentations (99-2012) xvid avi  (ETs, UFO, UFOs, Abductions, Cover Ups, Aliens Tesla and more)

First of ALL - WARNING!!!! long names used in avis.. 
it works find on win 7.. so make sure to download to a root FOLDER
like C: else you might find cant play them or move them later
(not without using my renamer tool for windows)
I like meaningful names for searches with full descriptions
so thats why I do it.. take it or leave it.. I dont care :)

I converted these from the web in to xvids. However they are only part
of their presentation.. some are 10, 20 or 30 minutes long of the 60min presentations.
 Its probably 
enough to get the info on the main topic they are discussing on,

Some are very good with some BS-ity ones with out their theories
on Ancient Aliens

Sadly... instead of making the info free to everyone so even the poor
can hear whats presented MUFON like most orgs profiting from UFO
interest..want to sell the full presentations on DVDS even if some
are obviously converted from non HD formats. like TAPE

its a big collection and will take much time (days) to seed out
so try not to hit and run and get the word out

HELP TO SEED If grabbing for your collection and if you
later decide to rip a dvd you have of the full presentation then
re-share on p2p :)

enjoy
