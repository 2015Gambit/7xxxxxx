,rax369,2012-06-05T16:10Z,"To all of u complaining about the sound... unfortunately this time for some reason it was encoded with only 2ch, that's why your players are detecting it, to have poor audio:

Looks like this change of quality in the last  season episode is becoming some kind of pattern. The same damn thing happened with the last season episode of hawaii five-0 (Hawaii.Five-0.2010.S02E23.720p.HDTV.X264-2HD.mkv)

WTF is going on with this scene groups!!! ??? >:("
,Ayni.,2012-06-06T06:36Z,"Thanks DibyaTPB. Fine work, always.

Let's wait patiently a year for Season 3.."
