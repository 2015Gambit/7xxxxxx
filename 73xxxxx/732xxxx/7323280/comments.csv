,Rellis271,2012-06-03T02:00Z,"since a few days I try to get Encore cs6 to work,
I tried really everything including your fix encore, but it did not work , the cracked DLL did not work either regardless what I do I receive Error
"" Encore can not run in trial mode "
,Angertek,2012-06-03T08:31Z,"Did you follow the video and try activating it 8 times? Just like the video said. sorry it was in spanish by the way. if that still didn't work then sorry just forget about Encore there are many other apps like encore, such as vegasDVD or cyberlink software. I really don't get why people want encore so bad, but i tried my best to get it to work for you guys."
,Angertek,2012-06-03T08:35Z,Aobe just released a new update why don't you try again one more time after getting update?
,Angertek,2012-06-03T18:06Z,"I HAVE OFFICIALLY TEST IT. ENCORE FINALLY WORKS WITH THE NEW UPDATE DOWNLOAD IT AND REPLACE .DLL AND USE PATCH PROVIDED IN DOWNLOAD. IF IT DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU I CAN A SURE YOU IT WILL WORK NOW!!!

,Dr1ver_X,2012-06-03T21:25Z,"This is great! All products work for me, but the updates are disabled... anyone have an idea?"
,PRESIDENT_CHAVEZ,2012-06-03T21:30Z,"it worked for me, great job.  encore working 100% and premiere presets working fine.  excellent explanation in the youtube tutorial the link is in one of the folders."
,Angertek,2012-06-04T01:27Z,"GO to direct links from Adobe here ---> http://www.adobe.com/downloads/updates/
Just find the updates and download. REMEMBER after installing updates copy the .dll again if the programs don't work. Only if they don't work!"

,tomh1,2012-06-05T03:31Z,LIES LIES LIES DOES NOT WORK.. FOLLOWED instructions step by step. NEVER FUKIN WORKS
,roadie.w,2012-06-05T07:02Z,"Does not work!! after doing the steps, it screwed up all my other programs.  I was able to run everything except encore, but after trying, nothing worked!"
,talonhead,2012-06-05T10:57Z,"Weird problem here...I haven't seen anyone post anything close to it with a solution, so I'll comment on it.
I do the typical .dll swap and everything is happy. Once I restart the machine (for any reason one might have to reboot) the app won't open when clicking on either shortut or going straight to the .exe itself.

When attempting to open it states this error: ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You do not have permissions..."".

Even the icons are blank from all Adobe CS6 apps listed in Explorer or anywhere else I have a shortcut.

I've tried everything from opening as admin to disabling anti-virus software. No joy.

Anyone have a workaround? This only happens when I restart the machine. The software itself works great...up until then.

Thanks!"
,Albertino5,2012-06-05T11:53Z,"talonhead, I get the ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. etc."" message ONLY when I try to use the patcher. Don't know if there is any relationship between the two."
,Angertek,2012-06-05T19:02Z,"First instead of saying lies lies lies why don't you explain your problem. Isn't it possible that you are not doing it right and not following the video .

To roadie.w, when you downloaded the update your other programs didn't work because you forgot to replace the .dll after the download. If you did do that then you have other problems not related to the main crack... Then, try moving the patcher to the encore directory and run it from there as administrators or otherwise it wont have permissions to run and it won't work obviously ( see some of the main problems lie in small little mistakes, so watch out for those) then replace the .dll again and run it. If it doesn't work place the original again and run it, and then after that replace the crack for the original one more time. And then it should work."
,Angertek,2012-06-05T19:10Z,"talonhead i got an answer for you. (First of all) Thank you for saying it works great that makes me happy.

The problem you are having is not directly related to the software. So i need you to double click on the program just like you have tried before when you restart. The right click on your start menu and start task manager. Go to processed and search in the list for the name of the program for example encore, you would look for Adobe Encore.exe. If that is running then your problem is within other stuff going on in your computer such as the ones you mention antivirus or other. If it is not there in the processes, then i have not idea what it is so i suggest you re installing it, sorry :( ( i don't know everything) "
,Angertek,2012-06-05T19:21Z,I want to add to my last comment sorry i just read the Albertino5 one and i realized that yes it might be related to the patcher. Maybe the patcher didn't work. However i suggest you to change the date to a more recent date maybe one day before you installed it.
,Dr1ver_X,2012-06-06T15:10Z,"@Angertek
I've found an alternate solution for updates; if you have cs5.5 installed, you can use the cs5.5 app manager to update the cs6 ones. Just open any cs5.5 apps and go to help > updates. VoilĂ !"
,Angertek,2012-06-06T19:22Z,Dr1ver_X Thank you i tested it already and it works. Thanks for the help
,HaPPyHeLL88,2012-06-07T18:50Z,"Hey im having some issues.

The instructions were pretty vague, I followed the ones that told me to run as trial. I think I put the .dlls in all the right folders but again, very vague. I an not sure where to enter the keys. I selected the""buy"" option when starting up photoshop which then gave me the option to ""enter the serial #"" when I tried to enter one it said it required internet access so I reconnected it. I tried entering both  key numbers but neither worked. What am I missing??"
,Angertek,2012-06-10T17:05Z,"happyhell88. Simple. You only missed the description that i wrote here. If Photoshop actually opened and the  enter serial comes after, then your only problem is the host. So just download the adobe tool by the thingy, link in the description. And run it is that easy, and you'll never have any host problems with adobe again. Very easy you should not have any problems sorry for late response"
,squint85743,2012-06-17T01:25Z,"I had the same problem that talonhead had. I tried everything, and still my photoshop would disappear after a reboot. I asked everyone, and no one had a good answer. Finally, I reformated and so far everything is working fine. 

This problem is very frustrating."
,saydaysago2008,2012-06-17T03:20Z,"MISSING PREMIERE CS6  PRESET / CODEC PROBLEM SOLVED /////


This solution worked for me, I can't promise it will work for everyone.. try it out guys:

1) Uninstall Premiere CS6
2) Reinstall Premiere CS6
3) Open Premiere once and click 'continue trial', then close the program.
4) Delete the file: ' /program files (x86)/common files/adobe/adobe pcd/cache/cache.db'
5) Apply the cracked .dll file


All presets/codecs should now be working"
,rediej,2012-06-17T10:24Z,"It works. It's a pain in the A$$ for the whole thing, but it worked for me.

Plus, even Encore is being working, the Libray still missing. In fact, everything is there, but for some reason all the content have bugs in the extension of the files, which have and extra ""loc"" at the end of the extension. All that you need to do is remove that extra ""loc"". For example, in the folder Corporate there should be a file named ""Corporate Menu HD.psdloc"", so rename it to ""Corporate Menu HD.psd"" and it'll appear in Encreo from now on! Note that there are some files with extension ""emloc"", so do the same thing with those, just remove the loc.

Library folder is at ""C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Encore CS6Library"""
,Angertek,2012-06-19T22:20Z,"saydaysago2008 yes that works thank you, and it works too for encore once you get it working. Next upload it would be much better"

,Angertek,2012-07-05T04:15Z,"bomb23 choose try, then replace the .dll in the program dir. If that still doesn't work please inform me thats very unusual compared to the common problems and yes Adobe Acrobat doesnt have any updates with he new cs6 so just download the old one is the same"
,mmantra,2012-07-05T10:37Z,Premiere doesn't have the usual available presets and the mercury playback engine software only option in project settings is greyed out.  Both are fine in previous version of 5.5.  How do I get these pls. tnx

,dmoore13,2012-07-15T04:22Z,"Premiere Pro Error: ""Unable to find compatible video modules"" 
(If you have AMD HD Graphics)
1. Go to the Catalyst Control Center Application
2. Click ""Power""
3. Click ""Switchable Graphics""
4. Set everything to ""High Performance""
5. ""gpusniffer.exe"" is Premiere Pro, set it to 
""High Performance""
6. Check the box that says ""Show a pop-up 
warning for unassigned applications"".

*Premiere Pro & Encore both require 3D graphics and won't run without them. 
I thought that my Premiere Pro and Encore weren't cracked properly, then I did this and both work no problem (Encore was freezing after I selected New Project)."
