Stop uploading X copies in the same day and just upload the best unless they are very different.  If any of these were HD or something it would be fine, but three cams back to back is stupid spam."

,tflagger997,2012-06-04T11:06Z,"I am not disputing that, what I am saying to the Cam Spammers is that uploading three copies in the same day is lame.  Since all cams of this have been crap so far, all three are likely crap, though this might be slightly less crap since it is smaller.

I think the real problem is that they just keep uploading other people's work without ever checking the quality.  If you post it, your skulls should be on the line for the quality.  
Post 5 bad copies in a row, and get downgraded.
