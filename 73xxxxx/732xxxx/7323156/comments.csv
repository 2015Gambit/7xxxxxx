,setzerfoxclaw,2012-07-09T02:32Z,"@DJThi - no he isnt a bot, he DOES respond sometimes, usually on his games.

@Harley - There is no Cinevia work around for the PS3.  I highly recommend that if you have a HD TV with USB ports that you pick up an External Harddrive and watch it from there.  Thats what i do and it works wonders."
