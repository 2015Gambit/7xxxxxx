Earlier this year, Boys Behind Bars took a look behind the scenes at the lives of several young men in Polmont Young Offenders Institute. 

Their stories highlighted the fear and violence in their lives, their struggle to find a way of coping and their hopes for a better future after ending up behind bars at such a young age.
