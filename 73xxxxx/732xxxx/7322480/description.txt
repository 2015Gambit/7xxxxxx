This AVI file that I uploaded was originally split into CD1 and CD2 since there was really no single AVI file of it I thought I would splice the CD1 and CD2 together and included English SRT file for those who can not understand Korean.

I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I have, also keep seeding, since this is a hard to find movie I will add more movies shortly. If you have a request for a movie I will try to find a good copy to upload for the masses

keep it alive,
