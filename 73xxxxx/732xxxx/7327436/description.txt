The summer driving season is here.

People believe myths about oil and gasoline. We're running out of oil! America should be energy independent! Our oil comes from evil dictators! Electric cars and ethanol are so much better for the environment and America!

This week we challenge those ideas.

Jerry Taylor of the CATO Institute and Power Hungry author Robert Bryce explain the truth about oil and gas.

Bill O'Reilly and I continue our argument about those greedy oil companies "conspiring" to keep gas prices high.

Fox Business reporter Charles Payne will be here to explain how oil speculation works.

Former Governor Sarah Palin also joins us to talk about her famous mantra, "Drill, baby, drill!"
