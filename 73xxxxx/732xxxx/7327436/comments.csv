As warming continues, ice recedes even faster that it already is, and Arctic oil becomes easier and cheaper to extract, which reduces gas prices, which increases consumption, which accelerates warming, which melts even more ice... get the pattern?

I hope you do before it's too late!

,RTT2,2012-06-14T10:41Z,"""Good."" says it all, doesn't it? What did I say about passive aggression?!

Reflex, industry-like alarmism about the bottom-line (oil prices), unashamedly equal to the 'declinists' this show criticizes (those who say 'oil is running out!'). Amazing.

Believe me, you won't have to worry about oil prices when the combined effects of global warming hit the economy.

Good night and good luck! "
,RTT2,2012-07-01T11:19Z,"Oh, and btw, I expect you know that oil prices will go to $100+ soon anyway (because of speculation), so that's a nice safe prediction to falsely attribute to non-existent intervention, isn't it?!  

Regulation ain't the bogeyman, it's the future you take for granted. History is littered with examples of industry kicking and screaming against regulation that is now accepted and keeps us all healthier and safer, without even realizing it. Because people take it for granted, denialists are falling over themselves to retro-unfit all these advances and claim we'd be better without them all, whereas in fact we'd be India. Think about it!

Gas prices don't affect me anyway because I only ever buy $20 worth!

That was a joke, for those who made it to the end, sorry! Stay off the blogs...."
,RTT2,2012-07-05T10:26Z,"I should say also that I'm not in favour of exorbitant gas prices. Here in the UK, where gas station signs display a picture of an arm and a leg, we've just got off the 'fuel escalator'. Industry is the main polluter by far. Despite the fuss over the Australian one, few people know that the Republic of Ireland has had a fair carbon tax for a couple of years now, without any problem...

Anyway, time for another joke:

'In the '70's, Edward Hammer was an engineer at GE Nela Park and lived in Mayfield Village, Ohio, with his wife Gertrude and young son. Prompted by the oil crisis a few years before, in 1976 Edward Hammer invented the world's first energy-saving light bulb. Sadly he didn't see much of his family after that.'
