[Bridge - 50 Cent]
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I Said
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I Said
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
I suppose to blow, you suppose to know
Not to go against me or its R.I.P
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money
I'm special ed , I got special bread
It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a hoe, bitch leave me now
I fuck when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike
She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something a suck, she give her something to eat
Its never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

[Bridge - 50 Cent]
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I Said
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I Said
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
