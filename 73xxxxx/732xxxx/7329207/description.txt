Got a treat for all of you today. This torrent is an exceedingly rare bootleg album of The Beatles by the name of "Stars of '63". It was recorded during their trip around Europe in 1963. They stopped in Stockholm, Sweden to record a little show in front of a live television studio audience and that is where these recordings came into being. There are nine tracks, seven songs and two introduction/interview recordings. It was recorded at Karlaplansstudio (name of the Swedish T.V. studio) on October 24th, 1963 and later published under Swingin' Pig Records (bootleg label) in 1988. All tracks are in 320kbps mp3 and there are two high resolution images of the cover inside, one is a front/back wraparound and the other is just the front cover. Enjoy.
