Two in the Wave (2010) FULL DVD9 (ISO)

*** 
I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

This is a DVD rip to an ISO so you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.

This rip is a (DVD-9)

- What I mean by (DVD-9) this ISO is a 1:1 rip and is not compressed in any way if you are burning this you will need a double layer disc.
- What I mean by (DVD-5) this ISO has been compressed to fit onto a single layer disc, the main film has been touched as little as possible and unless you are watching this on a high definition projector at over 60 inches you should not be able to notice any difference. Nothing has been taken out of the original DVD.

SYNOPSIS:  
Emmanuel Laurent appeals directly to fellow film buffs with this absorbing portrait of French New Wave icons François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, capturing their relationship through rare interviews and archival footage. Laurent's documentary premiered at Cannes Film Festival exactly 50 years after the Cannes debut of Truffaut's first feature, The 400 Blows -- a film that signaled the New Wave's cinematic arrival to much fanfare.
