[lloyd banks]
Man we gotta go get something to eat man
IΓÇÖm hungry as a motherfucker

[50 cent]
Ay yo man, damn whatΓÇÖs taking homie so long son?

[banks and 50]
Ahh, ohh, what the fuck!? 

[50 cent]
Ahh! son, pull up! pull up!

[50 cent]
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I canΓÇÖt see
IΓÇÖm trying to be what IΓÇÖm destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in a nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gonΓÇÖ see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
ΓÇÖcause IΓÇÖll come and take your life away

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I donΓÇÖt cry no more
DonΓÇÖt look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ainΓÇÖt dead
IΓÇÖm the diamond in the dirt, that ainΓÇÖt been found
IΓÇÖm the underground king and I ainΓÇÖt been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
IΓÇÖm the greatest, something like ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
IΓÇÖve been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, goΓÇÖhead, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ainΓÇÖt over
