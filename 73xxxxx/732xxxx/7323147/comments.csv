,ifiknewyouthinkidbehere,2012-06-02T23:01Z,"Seed people. I am downloading at 200 and seeding 600, and I only have 3 % so far!!"
,DPanda11,2012-06-02T23:14Z,Thanks! I missed it today and couldn't find anyone else who had it in HD.
,Scyrthis,2012-06-02T23:19Z,FINALLY! 
,xjonasxv,2012-06-02T23:28Z,where can I find english subs for this episode?
,ifiknewyouthinkidbehere,2012-06-02T23:48Z,"@xjonasxv why would you need that, korra has one of the easiest to understand english that I encountered..?"
,ikari451,2012-06-03T00:07Z,"I could only connect to 1 seed. Anyway i ll be seeding  for a few hours.
For subs always go to Addi7ed."
,LordSarito,2012-06-03T00:21Z,"Quality is excellent, Thanks a lot SecTPB.

I will probably be replacing this file with an MP4 when they get uploaded."
,EvilFluffy,2012-06-03T00:31Z,ty for that one ^^ a/v10
,patpatpatpatpat,2012-06-03T00:41Z,"@xjonasxv

like ikari said go to addic7ed.com
I'll post the english subs in a few hours(3-4hours). Doing everything alone take a freaking long time."
,xjonasxv,2012-06-03T00:44Z,Because sometimes I don't understand everyting.. and it's easier to have the subs for me..
,cloudsora,2012-06-03T00:55Z,PublicHD is almost always better than secludedly
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-03T00:56Z,"@Danimal1q2w3
lol it doesn't get any better than what it aired at on tv. encoding it makes it worse."
,3htthe,2012-06-03T01:16Z,"@Danimal1q2w3

Stop going on other people's torrents just to advertise your own. "
,ieatjesus,2012-06-03T04:12Z,anybody else's video not synced with the audio?
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-03T05:15Z,"Get my 1080p mp4 encode here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7323884

PS3 and Xbox ready."
,fdsalkj,2012-06-03T08:41Z,"What's the point of uploading in 1080p if the broadcast was in 1080i (540p)?

Isn't that making the file needlessly bigger?"
,evilryok,2012-06-03T16:44Z,"watch avatar legend of korra episode 8 dubbed HQ

go to pinoyanime dot TV/avatar-the-legend-of-korra-episode-8/"
,TButz,2012-06-03T21:44Z,"Downloaded this, after it finished my downloads folder crashed windows explorer every time.. I checked the folder and the legend of korra folder was completely empty...
Not sure what really happened here.
No one else has said anything about it."
,chieftain20,2012-06-03T22:22Z,"@fdsalkj 1080i isn't 540p. 1080 is the resolution ""i"" means it is interlaced ""p"" means progressive. The correlation of i and p is referring to the frame rate in frames per second. Where 30i is 15p and 30p is 60i. Not resolution. Try to keep the dumbness out."
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-04T02:57Z,It's actually native 480i. NickHD upscales the broadcast to 720p. I captured the episode at 1080i for the 1080p release.
,abraley,2012-06-04T21:48Z,Audio synch is off...
,abraley,2012-06-04T21:49Z,The audio synch is off...

,genkli,2012-06-17T18:16Z,"@chieftain20 Lol fail Face palm. Clearly you both now something about interlace but also you both don't know what it is. As the word says it is Interlaced contrary to progressive. Progressive is simple. Every pixel on every frame is stored is it should be as set of images. Interlaced is that the first only the even rows are stored, on the next frame only the odd rows are stored and when watching the video every frame only the half amount of lines is refreshed. that's where the 540p idea comes from. and your frame rate idea comes from the fact that for the same amount actual image you need twice as many frames on interlaced because only the half is stored. but interlaced sucks cause you can CLEARLY see the lines if something moves quickly. But still lol because you were talking as if you explained a lot."
