,Larfen,2012-06-02T21:55Z,"Don't listen to Scrythis, he has no idea what he's talking about."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-02T22:03Z,"I think this is The Legend of Korra S01E08 When Extremes Meet 720p x264 NoGRP

as that release is 165mb

no proof of it though"
,Nimxxx,2012-06-02T22:14Z,"did someone downloaded this, and can say for sure its a fake?"
,c4charlie,2012-06-02T22:21Z,"Check out http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7282871/The_Legend_of_Korra_Episode_07_[720p]

Daman4Iife has done 720p x264 files less than 200MB, in fact he's done all episodes of this 1-7 so far.

Scythis & bassitos, you both say that this file is fake, if your only basis is the file size, maybe you should let your mouth do the talking in future and not your ass!!!"
,Scyrthis,2012-06-02T22:51Z,"This one has the right size:

,c4charlie,2012-06-03T00:39Z,"@ Scyrthis
I have just finished downloading this torrent/magnet. I can CONFIRM this file is REAL. It is 1280x720, has a total bitrate of 996 kb/s and looks amazing on my 42"" LG 3D Smart TV.

Next time you're trolling, why don't you download the file first. 
Maybe an apology to the uploader would be nice and why don't you thank them for taking the time out of their life to share this with everyone. 
Oh, and one last thing, why don't you remove your comments telling others it was fake when it clearly wasn't!!!!"
