I hope it is working for you. Considering no ones saying anything."
,Epockis,2012-06-06T06:55Z,I don't understand why u uploaded this and why anyone would dl it.
,Warsun99,2012-06-06T15:55Z,"Well Epockis if you were on the Nexus an you were doing tech support for a guy who is very stubborn you would understand.The guy who created these will constantly remove the mod from his page.Which as you can see each of them are completely different.

The one that does not work.I end up doing tech support trying to help people get it running.Then instead of leaving the old version there.He completely removes the older version an puts up a new one that is hardly functional an crashes your system OR actually works.Then he takes THAT one down too! Which is a pain in the butt.This is not actual porn.This is a mod to get your characters to preform sex acts."
,Warsun99,2012-06-07T01:13Z,"If some of you are new here is the page you have to read to get this working correctly.

NOTE: Read ALL of it.Don't skip some things.The Comments are very useful.But you may need a account with them.

This is from the Skyrim Nexus.Found here.

skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10748

Once here you can download the latest versions.

Now here is where the confusion kicks in. Some of them are stand alone.The others only the female works an on others only the males work.All versions still require these files to put UNDER what you are installing an some of the other versions Cherry has to be installed over one of the others.Like i said confusing.

1.Skyrim Patch 1.4

2.CHSBHC - BBP - Nude and Jiggly Mod by CherryHotaling For Female body.

3.Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles by Chris57 and FavoredSoul For Males

Now when doing this some of them require you to wear the amulet of Debella an the others do not.Again.i do not know which ones. Enjoy"

,Warsun99,2012-06-07T19:25Z,"I forgot that one of the newer ones like 1.7 or 1.8  requires the Script animation program. From 

Joshs Skyrim Behavior File Patcher

,Warsun99,2012-07-04T17:19Z,So far tested 1.7 seems to be the best working version.
,jacksparroww010,2012-07-05T14:07Z,which specific version uses the FNIS behavior mod? 1.5 ?
