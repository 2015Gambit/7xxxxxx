The Indwelling - The Seventh Book in the Left Behind Series

Even though Nicolae Carpathia is dead, the intense action continues! The question remains, though, who killed the Antichrist? Who is the one responsible for his death?

In The Indwelling, the second half of the seven-year Tribulation period comes to pass with the horrors of GodΓÇÖs judgment abounding and the hope of salvation peeking through the devastation.

The death was as visible as any in history. Millions saw the antichrist die. But prophecy has a lot to say about whether or not he stays that way...
