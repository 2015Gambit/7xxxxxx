2. Wait for a file to come out.
3. Click on the file ""ISO""
4. Transfer your game to the ISO folder.
Tada! Now go play.
""Oh wait, i don't have an ISO folder."" Create a folder named ISO in the memory stick file in your pc and inside the ISO file create a folder named VIDEO. 
Alright, now go play."
