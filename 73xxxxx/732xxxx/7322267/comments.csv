read the description - and you wake up (you're in wrong section?)

NOT running on Win - it's for Mac only, do you know?"
,captnzap,2012-06-08T16:05Z,Both included apps declared the file is corrupt.
,captnzap,2012-06-08T16:13Z,"Oops... about the ""corrupt"" declaration..
Reading the instructions helps.

Open the app directly (not the .sb2 data file)
Click on Installing Serial Box tab.
Instruction method 1 worked, (method 2 did not for me)."
