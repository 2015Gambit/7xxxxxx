,nileshtambe,2012-06-10T16:47Z,"no need to burn on cd or copy on usb

u can just add entry in boot menu of windows 7 with the help of easy bcd

it will create new boot entry u can name it anything like emergency boot /win 7 pe

whenever ur main os fails to load u can boot from that entry

i do have portable (firefox , mini partition wizard ,norton ghost) on my data drive apart from my 2-3 windows installation drive.

i can use them to partition hdd, restore ghost image ,do ghost backup, "
