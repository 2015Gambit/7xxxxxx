[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-03T23:07Z,"DO not download, This was ment to be removed."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-03T23:09Z,"Do not download, uploaded wrong torrent due to thepiratebay lagg."
,MaRz0o,2012-06-04T08:11Z,"Yeah, cause this is an .MKV file format. Which torrent is the correct one for PS3 users?"
,CombustionMan1,2012-06-04T12:54Z,Neither work on PS3 if this is an mkv. The other one has too many reference frames and only plays sound on PS3. Hopefully the correct PS3/xbox ready version will be uploaded soon.
