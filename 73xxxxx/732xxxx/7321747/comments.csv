[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-03T17:07Z,"I only have about another dozen of these from the 7th through 9th Seasons combined.  Got a lot of them from Demonoid full-season torrents, and they're SLOW.... Also the video quality on several episodes I skipped when there was enough of the files done to view them was really bad. 

I also will be uploading some SNL shows from that era from my own DVD+R off-air collection, although some of those discs including the 1984-85 season are unreadable by my computer's optical drive."
