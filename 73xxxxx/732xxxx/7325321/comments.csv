Thanks for uploading these torrents but can you please seed them? I will seed each one for ages if you let me get them downloaded? Cheers :)"
,Samsung04,2012-08-08T03:41Z,ok I can do this RIGHT NOW
,Genesis69,2012-09-16T02:49Z,"@Samsung04, thanks for uploading these gems. I've grabbed s01 and 02 from other sources, but really wanted to download the full dvd iso as you have provided.  Unfortunately, I've been stuck on 99%, 79% and 60% respectively for 3 torrents. No activity for 3 days now.

Not sure why people hit and run and don't seed, but I would greatly appreciate if you could help some of us along by seeding and I will seed for the forseeable future as I play the iso directly through vlc and have no intention of burning the iso then deleting...Thanks!!"
,Genesis69,2012-09-20T00:26Z,@snish- you are completely FOS.  Seed forever?  Then why are there 3 of us stuck at 0%.  You lying tool; this is what's wrong with this site. Selfish pricks.
