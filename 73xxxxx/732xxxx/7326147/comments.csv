But as we are already seeding simultaneously
many different torrents at the same time,bandwith is a bit slow as well.
Btw,many udp trackers often block our seed so job is a bit more difficult as well.
(N/A,Time out,request fails...)
We suggest you all to regulary check them and update every time it would be necessary as well.
Just a question of patience bud,no more.
Anyway,we apologize for this inconvenience as well as for our a bit slow seed then.
regards"
