After a serious check about my previous torrent concerning the same movie i saw many anomalies about the full list of subtitles where more than 50% of them are totaly missing in fact.
Guess,probably a bug during conversion...
I apologize for this inconvenient so.
So i decided to reup and seed for this time,the full movie that will fit to a BD 50.
Real size : 37,9 GB
Same fps playblack : 23,97
4:2:0 YUV
HD High Res 16/9
but this time the exact original video codec has been conserved such : VC1/1080p
new screen resolution so : 1920 x 1080
Video is uncompressed without H.264 effect so.

A total of 19 subtitles (Sub/Idx) is available now such as :

Japanese,English,French,Dutch,German,Spanish,Italian,Chinese,Portuguese,
Norwegian,Finnish,Danish,Swedish,Korean...
For a total of 14 different languages real so.

For the audio the rest is unchanged anyway like :

1)Japanese DTS 5.1 by default
2)English to DTS-HD MA
3)French to DTS 5.1
4)Italian to DTS 5.1
5)German to DTS 5.1
6)Spanish to DTS 5.1

____________________________________

No pixelation at all for me anyway.Still some noise or grain due to original less good VC1 encoding/decoding but not in all scenes for sure.
(Nighly scenes and few others only...)
IQ and VQ are best indeed than my previous smaller version.
Indeed this version takes largely a bigger size,i know.
reserved to real fans only of this movie then.
Fast peers only,please,till getting a suffisant number of true seeders so.
See yourself and decide what you prefer so.
Enjoy and seed,please !
best regards
