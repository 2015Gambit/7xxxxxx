,Freakando,2012-06-07T19:24Z,"Hey!! 

I've done everything that it has to be done, but when I get into crack folder, the files are ""EXEC."" I know that means it's a windows file and it can't be opened on Mac, but i wanna know why... is that i've done something wrong.. or the file it has been damaged somehow....  so if anybody knows how i can get this file to work... i would really appreciate it. 


Thanks!! :) "
,joaolonas,2012-06-07T21:08Z,"If you open mac ox folder inside ""show contents"" you see two similar files of the ones in the crack folder. just replace them and it will work.

So far the game is working on my HD  3000 graphic card despite the initial warning. 
And its working greaaaat :-)

thanks baktiar 77!"

,baktiar77,2012-06-09T04:32Z,"to those having problems you have to install the crack (aka move two files to macos folder)

Follow mine or others instructions in the comments"

,15aaronh,2012-06-13T07:19Z,Why are there like 100 .rar files?
,Winchflat,2012-06-13T13:17Z,"When I open the application, it jumps on the dock, and that's it. Also if I click on it, it disappears, and i've put both files in the correct place. Any suggestions?"
,15aaronh,2012-06-15T02:31Z,"For those with problems with the crack, remember, you have to replace the two files already in MacOS, not just copy/paste the Crack folder. Baktiar, You sir are my hero. running well on 2011 macbook air"

,VilonRetuza,2012-06-18T02:41Z,"I'm new to this whole multi- torrent rar stuff
Do you unrar all 160 rars or do you just unrar one?
I'm so confused."

,gmodm1,2012-06-18T05:12Z,"I can't move my mouse, It might be because I have a trackpad, but I still dont know "
,durnafers,2012-06-18T05:37Z,"I'm having an issue where I can't extract the rars properly. I've tried 6 different rar programs, and all of them say that part 65 has an error or is corrupt. Any ideas on what to do?"
,Olafbeast,2012-06-23T18:11Z,I can't get this to work i have extracted the last file and mounted it with unrarx but i can't open the dmg is it even supposed to be there or what?
,mistarz,2012-06-24T17:22Z,"15.GB of useless crap.No crack just stupid links to you cheap website and Facebookpage.
Dude really go cry in the corner!

Ps: learn how to make a .dmg file by the way."
,Huntman50,2012-06-24T23:46Z,"Ok this took me 3 days to download and it was worth it!! Yes you CAN update, but when you update be sure to drag the contents of the crack folder to the Mac OS folder and replace. I'm running a MBP 2011 with intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB. No serial code needed. Just press PLAY. THANKS!"
,rockyyeah,2012-06-25T00:44Z,seed please
,mistarz,2012-06-25T14:44Z,"Ok.There was no *Crack folder*
just 160 parts of .rar files.And 3 url files.
About the .rar it won't open...so days of download and you end up whit a worthless 15 GB.

I don't think it comes that way from the App store anyway......so if you wanna do a fine torrent for this buy it and just zip that one file.And crack it properly.

M"
,Huntman50,2012-06-26T07:07Z,@mistarz I used Stuffit to do the 160 rar files. I just clicked the first one and it took maybe 2-5 mins and whala. P.S. you get the crack folder after you do this
,bast0320,2012-06-27T15:31Z,"Please SEEEEEEED!  :)
I'm Seeding with 4 MB..."
,Scolopax2,2012-06-28T03:24Z,"Yeah so this didn't work for me..
Macbook Pro, 2009/2010.

Took over 3 days to download, 160.rar files.  Tried both UnrarX and stuffit, errors on both. Pretty disappointing as spent so much time and bandwidth to download...couldnt even get past unraring."
,Scolopax2,2012-06-28T05:11Z,"RE: Ok, this defiantly works now. Solved my problem before, just had to move all the files to my external hd before unraring, probably an issue with space or something. Everything works now, totally worth the time and effort, cheers baktiar77!"
,TheGranger,2012-06-28T06:50Z,It worked perfectly on my new retina macbook pro on max setting. I was able to update it as well. Thanks baktiar77!
,mistarz,2012-06-28T16:35Z,"Ok. I give it another try.

,ramaad73,2012-07-04T22:34Z,I'm also having trouble unraring the files.  Anyone have a solution?  I've tried UnRarX and Stuffit.  Also I have over 30 gigs of space on my hardrive so that shouldn't be an issue...
,gmodm1,2012-07-06T02:05Z,"@Joaolonas at you way earlier comment about the requirements, It ran on my 2 gigabyte ram and Ndivia M320 video card, so, yea"

,Highcampos,2012-08-02T13:41Z,"@hock261 after you unpack u get a file with the deusex drive and another file with the crack for you to unpack, unpack it and you get a file named crack, after you have installed the game in your applications, right-click on it and left-click on show package contents, inside the file contents, there's a files named MacOS, replace the unix files with the ones inside the crack file u unpacked. Afterwards just go to applications and start the game, enjoy."

I have a Kensington Trackball. To the others with the same problem: what mouse do you have?

I've read about issues with Logitech drivers (solution: uninstall them), but that doesn't apply to me."
