,pjones452,2012-06-02T14:31Z,finally! thank you!
,oooo11110,2012-06-02T17:13Z,i know right this takes way to long to be uploaded and then its always massive files and takes like 1 hour to download
,lockedup1,2012-06-03T05:08Z,"oooo: you obviously do not appreciate quality - here I'm risking my ass from possibly getting thrown out of one of the best trackers on the internet by uploading these just because I know there are other people who loves this show like I do, and then you show up with this annoying comment."
,pjones452,2012-06-03T08:16Z,"yeah no your the best dude, no one else will take the time to up a great quality episode of Locked up abroad so thanks a lot dude! If i knew how to do this I would, I'm sure its not so easy."
,pjones452,2012-06-03T09:22Z,"how the hell do you rip these episodes I wish I knew how, the quality looks great"
,lockedup1,2012-06-03T10:24Z,"The quality is great because it's a clean rip from iTunes, no re-encoding. I've never had any experience with iTunes myself, but there are guides out there that explains it. Basically you will need 3 programs: 

1:) iTunes of course
2:) Requim for removing DRM encryption from the downloaded episode
3:) MKVToolnix for making the final MKV file (the downloaded .m4v/.mp4 file from iTunes contains your account info so beware of not sharing that file with anyone...)

It's all relatively complicated so I'm not gonna try explaining it since I do not have any first hand experience with it, but you will find guides if you google ""iTunes Requim DRM"""
,pjones452,2012-06-08T18:07Z,nice thanks a lot man! I actually just got iskysoft video converter so i'm learning how to use that. I really appreciate the info!
