,xidio,2012-06-04T04:33Z,Wtf is wrong with your image?
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-04T04:35Z,"TPB kept giving me errors and I kept refreshing to get this to upload for like 15 minutes. Somehow, the  image tag for a different torrent I uploaded became the image tag for this episode. -.-

That is Josh Barnett & Daniel Cormier. Stupid stupid stupid site."
,bobby177,2012-06-04T04:52Z,"wtf cersei, why would you MARRY joffrey just because sansa bird got raped by the hound? guess this is the red wedding everyone kept talking about...."

[T],SecTPB,2012-06-04T05:58Z,"That spoiler is fake, guys. Don't worry. Just spam bots. Same with that survey idiot."
,cooisat,2012-06-04T06:12Z,Thanks! 
,bobby177,2012-06-04T06:13Z,"I am no spam bot, idiot"
,jay515069,2012-06-04T07:09Z,HEY PEOPLE THIS IS THE BEST SOURCE FOR GAME OF THRONES SO SEED DAMMIT SO WE CAN ALL WATCH THE SHOW WE LOVE SO MUCH!!!!!
,jay515069,2012-06-04T07:12Z,"And FYI if you are a true fan there can be no spoilers....CAUSE I ALREADY READ THE DAMN BOOKS. LOL.
If you like the show try reading the books and expanding your mind and reading the true genius of George R.R. Martin"
,int7777,2012-06-04T07:43Z,"@bobby177 

You're a fucking faggot dude. I could tell right away that what you wrote is a spoiler and stopped reading after Cercei, but you need to eat some more dick you queer."
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-04T09:04Z,"I actually don't follow the show all that much. I watch because it's on so I don't really know names and who is who, so honestly, I don't know if those are real spoilers, but if they are, then that kid is a fucking moron. Nothing I hate more than being spoiled in the things I love."
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-04T09:08Z,I love how there's a lot of Canadians downloading the torrent(Reading the IP logs). I heard a rumor that Canada gets a censored version of the show only? It would make sense with all the people from Canada. lol. That true?
,int7777,2012-06-04T10:03Z,"Yeah, just an obnoxious little kid trying to ruin the show for others. Thanks for the upload."
,int7777,2012-06-04T11:43Z,"And yeah, the spoiler is bullshit.. none of that happens. bobby is still a little shit though."

,Pathduck2,2012-06-04T20:21Z,"This one's got 3-4 encoding errors where it hangs for 5-10 seconds, unfortunately. Good picture and audio but just so you know..."
,bitate42,2012-06-04T20:44Z,Anyone want to hazard a guess as to why my audio and video won't sync up. I know it's on my end. Maybe an issue I'm having while torrenting? I had the same issue with the SEC upload last week.

,nogodnojihad,2012-06-05T05:27Z,"Yo, what's with the sexual tension in that photo? It's almosas thick as that between NewGoldStandard and Bobby the Spoiler!
