Documentary about the greatest public ceremony of the twentieth century. As well as recounting 
the events of Coronation Day, 2nd June 1953, the film focuses on the months of meticulous 
planning beforehand. What took place behind the scenes is told using diaries, letters, official 
records and government papers, together with much rare, evocative archive. There are interviews 
with historians and experts on royal ceremonial as well as participants in the ceremony. 
The Coronation was an immense challenge - the views of forceful personalities from die-hard 
traditionalists to forward-thinking innovators had to be reconciled, the movements of thousands 
had to be marshalled like clockwork, and the BBC had to mount its most ambitious television 
outside broadcast to date in the teeth of prime minister Winston Churchill's opposition. At the 
centre of it all was the 27-year-old Queen, bearing an immense responsibility while remaining 
apparently calm and unperturbed throughout.

This is a story of precision planning, last minute nerves and an ancient ceremony which brought 
together church, state, aristocracy and monarchy in a glorious panoply - the like of which will 
never be seen again.
