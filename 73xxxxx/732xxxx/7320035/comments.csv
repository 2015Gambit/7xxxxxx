,arsonisti,2012-06-02T00:40Z,"yeah, I get crash during intro also."
,Poulpe32,2012-06-02T00:40Z,"""Copy over the ""profiles"" dir to
your Documents Rockstar Games Social Club dir""

Do I need to copy the ""profiles"" directory itself right into the ""Rockstar Games Social Club"" or the files inside the ""profiles directory"" ?

1 - DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Clubprofiles

or 

2 - DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club 10FE371 + autosignin.dat

,klon0pin,2012-06-02T02:33Z,"i copied the whole profile folder and dropped it in the social club folder, I also pasted its contents directly into the social club folder. When it loads it says ""Profiles Found: 0"" then wants me to sign in. Any ideas??"

works with multi 10 retail dvd

Thanks brah"
,Green.Lantern,2012-06-02T03:47Z,"@Klono
when you launch the game
use playmaxpayne3.exe

make sure you're offline 
then it will have a 
'Offline mode' when you start the game and the little box pops up"
,klon0pin,2012-06-02T04:31Z,"I start the game with playmaxpayne3.exe, the box comes up and I select offline mode. It loads for a minute and then comes to the Select Profile screen for the social club, I can't get passed that. "
,Green.Lantern,2012-06-02T07:08Z,"if youre in offline press escape and just play
when you replace the profile folder replace the whole thing not just the content inside

you can try what I did
before this crack came out 
I made an online ID and once I logged in it asked me to put in a serial I put anything

then I got this crack and replaced the profile folder
maybe you need to make 1 online first?
idk make sure to apply all the updates in the proper order before hand

sorry for taking long I was playing the game :S"

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7333230/Max.Payne.3.v1.0.0.22.patch.cracked.READ.NFO-THETA

Works with RELOADED release after I already applied REALOADED's Updates, profile, dlc and Crack. I had already start playing the game too and I have no problem. I play offline and stay offline while playing.

1. Install the patch MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22
2. Copy over the contents of the /Crack dir to your installation
directory

NOTES

* This release does not include any previous patches, thus should be used only after v1.0.0.17 patch is installed.

CHANGELOG

* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodgeï¿½. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu).
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu.
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available. Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards). "

You have to apply the first REALOADED Updates, Crack, dlc and profiles that can be found seperately here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED works with Retail Version as well.

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the nstructions from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)

,ChromeZX,2012-06-23T18:52Z,"Hey guys, for those of you that don't want to have to shut off your internet each time you want to play, you can simply firewall the executables like danwat1234 has stated.

1.) On Windows 7, open control panel>system and security>Windows Firewall>Advanced Settings

2.) Under inbound rules, click new rule, navigate to maxpayne3.exe and block it.

3.) Do the same for playmaxpayne3.exe and renderer.exe under the social club directory.

4.) Under outbound rules, do the same thing for the same executables

5.) The game will automatically login to 2012RLD each time you star the game with your internet still connected (assuming you followed danwat1234's guide and logged in once with the internet off)"
