Contains tracks lifted from both their albums on Creation released in
the early '90s, along with non-album singles and hard-to-find B-sides.

Perfection, which is exclusive to this release. All tracks included
have been deleted and unavailable for several years. Includes a 20-page
booklet with new extensive liner notes from all four band members -
