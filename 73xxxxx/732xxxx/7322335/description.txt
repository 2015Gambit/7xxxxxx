Hour of 13-333-2012-GRAVEWISH

Hailing from the USA, Hour of 13's core duo of Chad Davis and Phil Swanson return 
with theirthird album, '333'. Cloaked in obscure tales ofthe bizarre and the lost, 
Hour of 13 bridge the gap between forlorn despair and cautious hope ontheir new 
album. Powered by majestic, haunting riff worship, and shrouded with occult sentiment
and themes, the album offers a glimmer ofsalvation for the alienated and the alone.
