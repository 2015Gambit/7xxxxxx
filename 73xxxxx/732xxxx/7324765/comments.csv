Would really like to see a bunch of mods as well...
In particular the Last's blood mod or the no death mod THANKS!"
,Dwarth,2012-06-04T09:54Z,"It would be impossible to keep up with the updates of mods

But I uploaded the mod you ask for :

,nagasumii,2012-06-05T08:33Z,"Please help, this doesn't work.

The other versions work, but not 180, what do I do? When I start at some maps it talks about something about a database error for catcouch tga file?

Also there's one map I CAN play on, but I can't build most objects!  Like if I try to make an arena, it says file not found!

When I reinstall and go to 175, the game works, but it's just so slow and doesn't have retry button.  How do I get 180 to work? Help please."
,nagasumii,2012-06-05T09:17Z,"Edit:  My bad it says Case error.  Then it mentions files like footpillow/catcouch/banner.tga and others.

What do I do to fix this problem?
Do you have alpha 179 or 178?
I would go back to 175 if it didn't lag so much when I put new objects."
,Dwarth,2012-06-06T10:35Z,"nagasumii I guess that's something you have to expect when playing an alpha of an independant game :/

If a new version doesn't work, just wait for a bit, like 5 or 10 new versions and try to install and play it"
,nagasumii,2012-06-06T12:55Z,"Alright I'll wait.  Also can anyone confirm that this worked for them, besides dwarth (Since he was the one that uploaded it)

Like if you're able to make an arena, and play on eroded map?"
,Puntley,2012-06-06T19:47Z,"i'm having a problem that i'm  hoping someone can help with.

The game wont even launch. When i double click a180-win it acts like it wants to load but no matter how long i wait, nothing happens. whats worse is it completely disables windows explorer when this happens. I am running Windows vista 32 bit OS with 4 gb ram. if anyone can help it would be very appreciated."
,stas02,2012-06-08T17:37Z,"Hello, I am having the same problem as Puntley. The game wont even launch. When i double click a180-win it acts like it wants to load but no matter how long i wait, nothing happens. whats worse is it completely disables windows explorer when this happens."
,Ironhearted,2012-06-12T21:07Z,"can you upload some maps for overgrowth ?
the ones just for preorderers"
,Dwarth,2012-06-12T21:30Z,I will upload the next version (182) and you'll can try again
,nagasumii,2012-06-13T00:46Z,What day do you think version 182 will be up?
,SmegMaster,2012-06-19T04:49Z,"Installation went smoothly, but the game is hardly playable. The camera keeps spinning counter-clockwise and whenever I alt-tab out and try to bring the game back up my whole computer shuts down. I also am unable to turn my pc back on afterwards, unless I pull the plug. Video settings made no real sense and in the end I was not even able to apply any of the changes made.

Oh, well, afterall it still is in alpha state..."
,SickJoke1,2012-06-19T16:20Z,"Dude, can you upload Receiver? the FPS which you fight drones and crap, it looks fun"
,koborati,2012-06-20T00:15Z,Hey um if you put up Overgrowth pls can you put up the game Receiver its a game that you can download for free if you preordered the game. PLS PLS PLS there are no other torrents or downloads for that game but it is very cool.
,koborati,2012-06-20T00:28Z,PLS RECEIVER its too good :D ok just wanted to share this.
,koborati,2012-06-21T11:50Z,Receiver is on the site yay someone put it up :D
,Dwarth,2012-06-22T01:22Z,"I don't know what the hell is receiver, I'll see if I can find it"

I'm going to torrent it"
,NopeNopeNope,2012-06-24T11:09Z,Is the torrent lacking content? Characters do not grunt in pain and I cannot seem to use weapons.
,NopeNopeNope,2012-06-24T12:57Z,"Dwarth,

I just downloaded an Overgrowth updater and it says that this version is Alpha 128.

:/"
,Dwarth,2012-06-25T11:20Z,"NopeNope uninstall any other version of the game before installing another one, I think I got a similar problem back then, I couldn't pick up weapons etc"
,NopeNopeNope,2012-06-26T04:09Z,"I think I might have had another version of Overgrowth installed that I had forgotten about, but I just updated, and I am at version 180.

Great torrent, btw."
,TheUnknownM,2012-06-26T05:16Z,"This works great. can you upload the SUMlauncher to automaticly update the game? and Dwarth, if you have a account then why torrent this and not just put a link from the direct site for us to download it?"
,nagasumii,2012-06-26T08:55Z,@Dwarth.  Can you upload the new version? It fixes the problems a lot of us were having.
,Dwarth,2012-06-26T12:27Z,"I'm pretty sure the SUMlauncher require a key to be used :

""Authenticating SUMLauncher
Note: We currently require users to enter their SPF key to be able to use the Launcher. This has been approved by the devs. In the future we plan to work with the devs to add support for an official API key.""

Same thing to download the game without using torrent, you have to enter the key which give you a temporary link

The torrents i'm uploading are the official torrents, the devs themselves are uploading them"
,TheUnknownM,2012-06-26T17:09Z,@Dwarth oh. okay. to bad the game is at 30$ though :P
,jack_sparow97,2012-07-06T15:38Z,"Puntley ammm i had same problem as you i dubleclick on a180-win nothing happens so i decided to wait, if you wait fo a minute this should start...i started setup 3 times :D but it's working by the way i have 3 GB of ram soo enjoy"
,EdwardRech,2012-07-15T10:54Z,Doesn't work for me. Lots of errors when loading. Other versions are fine. ANY IDEAS?
