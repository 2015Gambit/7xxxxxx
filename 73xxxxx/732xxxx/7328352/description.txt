The Mark - The Eighth Book in the Left Behind Series

The pouring rain only makes the night darker, as Buck and Albie watch the "Loyalty Enforcers" churn into production. And yet, above the cries of horror, one hears a unified voice, an eternal proclamation, the determined singing of those in a growing line of martyrs.

Within The Mark - Audio Movies, you will hear the jubilation of those who meet God for the first time, and the steadfast resolve of those about to me Him face to face. The world is told to make a stand one way or the other, and you have a front row seat.
