,BeSomeone,2012-06-04T22:22Z,How you add subtitles to these movies? I have mp4 files and subtitles but how to put them together so I can watch it in my Ipad?
[T],tr108,2012-06-05T00:17Z,"You're welcome guys.

@BeSomeone - I use Subler (Mac-only app) to add subs to my encodes. If you're a Windows person, try YAMB."

@TitanBoy - yes, I hope to do Pixar shorts from that collection, tho it'll probably be late July before I get to them. (I want to finish off the Pixar features first)"
