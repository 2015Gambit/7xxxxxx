,dmoore13,2012-07-15T04:23Z,"Premiere Pro Error: ""Unable to find compatible video modules"" 
(If you have AMD HD Graphics)
1. Go to the Catalyst Control Center Application
2. Click ""Power""
3. Click ""Switchable Graphics""
4. Set everything to ""High Performance""
5. ""gpusniffer.exe"" is Premiere Pro, set it to 
""High Performance""
6. Check the box that says ""Show a pop-up 
warning for unassigned applications"".

*Premiere Pro & Encore both require 3D graphics and won't run without them. 
I thought that my Premiere Pro and Encore weren't cracked properly, then I did this and both work no problem (Encore was freezing after I selected New Project)."
