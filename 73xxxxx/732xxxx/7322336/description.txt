Most eBook uploaders incluging myself almost always scan & upload full books and magazines.
For a change, I have decided to upload scanned magazine articles in this torrent!
Whenever I come across good articles, I usually scan them & share with my close friends who have similar likes.
These articles have been taken from Indian editions of Popular Science, Geo amd BBC Knowledge.
All are in PDF format with OCR.
If you like them, please leave a comment so that in future I can share some more with you!
