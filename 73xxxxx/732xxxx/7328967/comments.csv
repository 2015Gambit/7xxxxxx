Congrats on your VIP skull."
,Judirek,2012-06-05T07:41Z,"@Daman4Iife - Thanks for all your uploads, thank you even more for the format to be an .mp4 file! Lastly thank you for uploading as soon as the subs came out! 

To anyone out there:
- The uploader is a VIP and is trusted.
- I downloaded 4 of his anime movie uploads w/ high quality audio and video.
- He will listen to anyone's request.
- Please also read his description to avoid redundant questions."
,ceegronlee,2012-06-07T00:45Z,are the subs hardcoded? I'm assuming yes.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-07T01:45Z,"No, they are in .ASS file. "
,yamato74,2012-06-07T23:05Z,Are you sure this file is in 720p? I don't think so.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-08T01:29Z,"yamato this is a rip from the BLu ray Disk and Subbed By Commie, since the movie is not 16:9 it had to be cropped so thats why is 528 instead of 720 but is still 720p."
,DrakeJunior,2012-06-10T03:05Z,"Thank you for uploading! Been waiting for what, 4 months now for a translated version! I'll probably enjoy this tomarrow with loads of snacks in front of me."
,mcrowley,2012-06-11T19:58Z,Thanks Daman4Iife!  This is great.
,MalignantParadigm,2012-06-12T05:44Z,"Great torrent, and a fantastic movie. Definitely worth downloading."
,IfUBitchIWontSeed,2012-06-26T14:22Z,"Thanks!  I can't wait to see the later parts after the 1996 series left off.  I think that may require a little waiting though, but still better than nothing.  I thought this bad ass show had been abandoned!"
,frvme,2012-06-26T22:05Z,"I got one thing to say, since the subs are in a seperate file the ps3 can't read it.

Any tips on how to encode the subs into the video file ?

I've found another low res torrent with the subs but my ps3 shows currupted data."
,boywonder96,2012-07-03T05:43Z,Is there a version of this that has the .ass subtitles merged into the .mp4 file so that I can play the mp4 on my PS3 and still have subtitles?
,Dr.Hex,2012-07-27T04:23Z,Thnks for the upload :) . do u have any idea when the second part will be out ?
,Anzifer1,2012-07-27T15:00Z,end II ?
,ufalum88,2012-08-01T04:22Z,"The second one, The Capture of Doldrey, has already been released in Japan."
,Zielregen,2012-08-18T12:15Z,"The 3rd, Descent, is going to be released later in 2012. I'm glad they don't have huge gaps between releases. "
,JinRohEX,2012-09-21T16:55Z,Thank You. Very good quality so a well deserved +1.
