Didn't see any viruses, nor did my AV detect anything, but I think it's this game's self-defense that crashed my uTorrent.
If my PC survives a restart, then all people above were liars OR, since I noticed mayor lag spikes, while uTorrent was on, I guess, this game may have something that actually may ""destroy"" contents of your hard drive, if those contents are used while this game is running. Artificial fragmentation maybe?

My god, this game is sooo annoying, nothing near WWP anymore, everything is retarded.

thank God, that I DIDN'T buy this game."
