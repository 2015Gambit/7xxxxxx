Amish - Out of Order - Nat Geo USA DocuReality Series (2012) xvid avi S01E01-E07

Not my rips.. anyhow..

more religio based stuff from Nat Geo and Discby,, but at least its
a laugh..

I like how the guy says.. by leaving the movement they choosing
their after life.. e.g. Hell

thats real religion in motion.. preys on peoples fears of the unknown

Info from tvrage..

Follow a group of young people who grew up apart from the mainstream world and have now made the difficult decision to leave their Amish faith and face the challenges of living in the modern world

Ep3 is missing though no biggy.. it prob show up maybe..
still more episodes to air.. or at least one episode 8?

help to seed if grabbing

enjoy
