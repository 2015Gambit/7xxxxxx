[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-05T22:42Z,Just like with Goldfathers I've got all these episodes recorded onto my hard drive....they're just DRM'd so I gotta screen record them one day. :(
,pjones452,2012-06-06T06:29Z,this is great thanks i love this show and goldfathers is awesome too
[V],psspss,2012-06-06T13:35Z,"u havent sourced any more goldfathers..

cant you take a/v out from the pvr/dvr to

another dvr and record them to dvd-r

then you can use any soft like anydvd and dvdclone2 to rid the DRM

as Ive done that with SKY in my country
a few times :)

then you can run the decoded clonedvd2
files through avs converter 8.x to get avis and mp4s :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-06T20:08Z,"no it's more complicated than that, believe me I've tried

we record with USB tv tuners, meaning our computers are out DVRs. it's recorded through windows media centre, and for some reason TruTV and National Geographic have DRM on the recordings in the .dvr-ms files, so they only play in Windows Media Centre. Because of that I can't edit them or convert them. So Goldfathers, this show, and Wicked Tuna amongst other Nat Geo things we've recorded are just sitting here since it's pretty much impossible to remove DRM from .dvr-ms files - we've searched all over the internet on how to with no luck, we just have to use a screen recorder. Until we use a screen recorder on all the nat geo stuff we can't release any drm'd recordings. We've got no clue why certain channels have the DRM on the shows. Luckily most don't."

anything from overloaded servers
