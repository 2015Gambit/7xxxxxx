A=9
V=9"
,HONEYbbq,2012-06-04T00:15Z,"IT'S LIES!!!!! Well the provided screen shots are,  I'd give this copy
V:7
A:9
Pretty watchable but a bit slanted"
,gratefulforthis,2012-06-04T03:06Z,"Decent quality but the retard with the camera has it at about 20째 slanted.

How hard is it to have it level after all that effort.

I wouldn't download if you're reading this."
