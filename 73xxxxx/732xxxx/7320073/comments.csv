Thanks a lot  Hackulus  great up"

,Fritz.,2012-06-02T20:34Z,"id give it a 6 audio and 5 video.

a lot of the parts are obviously supposed to have a good bit of bass in the soundtrack which the recording device just doesnt pick up.

the video has people walking in front of the camera in multiple spots and has the top and/or bottom of the cropped off for large sections.


all that being said it is watchable"

,wbryana,2012-06-03T06:52Z,"Not bad.  Couple of blurry sections and people walking through the camera.  Also, towards the end of the movie it cuts off a lot of the screen so all you're seeing is the mouths and jaws of everyone...'cept the midgets (or little ppl). But even with all those little nit-picks it's watchable and thanks to the uploader :D"

Too many people walking in front of the cam. Just wait for another source.

Good attempt Hackulus it is appreciated but, alas... Honesty is the best policy. This source sucks."
,devisissy,2012-06-04T12:37Z,"Audio was good on this cam, picture out of focus a few times and at the end of the movie all you could see what the bottom halves of their faces, but quality was good enough to where I don't need to go out to the theater to see it.

Thank you Hackulus for the speedy upload.  "
,Byff,2012-06-04T15:25Z,"@henrywilson1228, actually it was 1hr.9min.37sec.(just kiddin'). But what happened, did the lights go up & everybody went out for a smoke or a pee break? How do you know all this stuff, were you actually there or had you already seen the movie in-theatre which of course begs the question - why dl a cam?"
,balrog814,2012-06-04T15:30Z,"A:7 V:8. Video clear, watchable, audio clear. There are people walking front, but those parts are irrelevant to the story. With this one can decide to pay for it in Kino, or not that cool of a film. If watching in cinema, I'd have been pretty upset, that I'd thrown my money out on this mediocre film. "

,MarkB1313,2012-06-05T01:01Z,Ive got a question... Usually on these long movies they split them so you can put them on two disks... These arent split... Can you split them? How does this work?
,BDPound,2012-06-05T02:41Z,MarkB get a DVD burner and join the rest of the 21st century. You're still burning movies on CD?

,XXD1XX,2012-06-05T06:29Z,@MarkB1313 So why would you need to split a 1.38GB file onto two DVD's when they have over 4GB capacity?

,Hephaestian,2012-06-12T02:34Z,"This movie STILL is not out in Australia untill 21 June. Granted in some areas the picture goes out of focus and you can hear people in the background however!, it clearly says this is a CAM movie but this is the BEST cam I have seen. I have never seen a picture so clear on a cam before. "
