I don't know what you heard about me
But a ***** can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a **********ing P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a ***** can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a **********ing P-I-M-P

Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that *** up in the Ramada
Them trick *****s in her ear saying they think about her
I got the ***** by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that ***** trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that ***** trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
***** hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You ****ing with me, you ****ing with a P-I-M-P
