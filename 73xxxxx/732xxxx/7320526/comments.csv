,kufelt,2012-06-05T01:24Z,"Guys - anyone has English subs for this one?
I searched all over but no avail....
Well - Polish will do for me as well :)"
,tokm-nikita,2012-06-10T17:28Z,No subtitles included in this download.
,Tari1977,2012-06-27T10:56Z,English subtitles are at www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4584144/la-delicatesse-en
,spiracle,2012-08-25T09:33Z,"@Tari1977 those are bad, possibly machine translated subtitles.  e.g. ""It should be actresses"".

Anyone have decent subtitles for this? Please?"
