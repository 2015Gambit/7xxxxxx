,Suomisisu,2012-06-07T18:28Z,1.7KB/s on a 20MB/S UP/DOWN connection. Can you greedy pricks please seed for the rest of us so we can in turn...? Sharing is caring. Don't delete the episodes after you watch them!!
,Suomisisu,2012-06-09T03:12Z,Ugh guys don't bother the quality is disgusting. Usually I am ok with 1080i but this is horrible. I didn't realise just how blurry the picture would be due to all the fast scenes. You're far better off picking up 'PublicHD's release of the entire show so far... They're 2.5 - 3GB 1080p rips. So they're about half the size of these and trust me the quality is far higher. These are all grainy as hell and they're blurry as hell in fast moving scenes... not only that but this torrent is slow as... give this a huge miss...
