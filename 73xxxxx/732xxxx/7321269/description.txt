[Hook]
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

[50 Cent]
Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once I ain't going again
First Zee got murked, then Roy got murked
And homies still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt
I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggaz switchin sides on niggaz just like that
U know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray on Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the Mac
In the hood they identify niggaz by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block
Cause he spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done
And make it wet niggaz if you round me son
