This is my top 10 collection of what I consider to be the worst films based on video games.  This collection includes:

Super Mario Bros.
Bloodrayne
Doom
Wing Commander
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li
Alone in the Dark
Street Fighter
Far Cry
House of the Dead
King of Fighters

I hope you enjoy these terrible movies.  If you have any suggestions for more movies that totally sucked that were based on video games please let me know in the comments.  Thank You.
