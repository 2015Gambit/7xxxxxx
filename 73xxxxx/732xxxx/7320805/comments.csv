see:

As you can see, there is no air date behind ep 9 and 10 on Imdb.
Besides, every source on the net points to ep 8 and the date June 1st as season finale.
Episode order on TV Rage: 8

Even STARZ! says it on their website (I took a screenshot, because they'll move on eventually):

And if they don't know, I don't know who could ;) !"

,Daker9,2012-06-09T12:53Z,"Yes you are correct. IMDB has now delisted episodes 9 and 10 and yes it is a great series. I hope it continues on!
