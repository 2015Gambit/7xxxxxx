Using a variety of formats, collaborative art projects result in wonderfully complex pieces, and often provide the glue between artists within a community. Heavy on visual inspiration, Collaborative Art Journals and Shared Visions in Mixed Media covers various organizational structures for collaborative art projects, offers instructions and tips for organizing such ventures, and includes interviews with organizers and participants of collaborative projects, as well as a healthy smattering of techniques including how to create books that can be added to as they travel and how to devise various binding structures for different paper projects.
