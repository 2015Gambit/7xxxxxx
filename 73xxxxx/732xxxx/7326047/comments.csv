In a nutshell, the keygen is buggy and failes to produce a working serial without some further, complicated research and file tampering.  Not a simple point, click, and voila!  :-(  No viruses detected using AVG, MS Security Essentials (boo - I know!) and Advanced SystemCare.  All are up-to-date and working properly.  Just not the keygen for Malware Fighter 1.4.0.22.

What gives, Aldi7??"
,Osiris69,2012-06-15T05:50Z,"All - I found the problem!  The keygen works if you do things in this order:

1) Run Setup.
2) Run Keygen and generate serial.
3) NOW disconnect from the internet.
4) Enter serial.
5) Reconnect internet and enjoy!

Hope that helps!

,Osiris69,2012-06-30T02:51Z,"Same problem here, all.  Keygen generates just one code and Malware Fighter works, until you reboot or shutdown your system, in which you have to rinse and repeat the process.

It's a shame that 'thethingy' doesn't handle stuff like this.  We'd know we were getting quality apps!  *Sigh*"
