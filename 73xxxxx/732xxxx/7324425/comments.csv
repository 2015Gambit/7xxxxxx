,HarleyDK,2012-06-04T15:43Z,"Very much appreciated, keep them coming in this quality, or the DVD quality you have released.
I will seed 10 times @ 3MB/s, but have to move them after that due to space issues"
,ili2882,2012-06-06T22:32Z,"I love your work, a request can you reeencode the HD versions to SD for those of us who are still stuck in the 20-th century.
Bandwidth is not an issue but resolution is, that's why I loved your work you did full SD 850x480 rips, not 620x340 like the scene XviD's, but there are a few of us that have problems with HD versions, and new hardware is not a viable solution."
[V],meech,2012-06-07T01:29Z,"Hi ili2882, funny you ask.  I actually already did encode these at standard def with ac3 (instead of dts).  I was going to wait until I finished uploading them in HD and then post the SD rips after that.  I just have one more (End of Time - Part 2) and then will release the SD versions shortly.  Then I will post seasons 5 and 6."
