,theblackthumb,2012-06-05T04:08Z,Sorry guys but i have slow residential internet it will be a week or so before i can get a fast seed box.
,chucknessberry,2012-06-06T06:27Z,"Be Nice, seed the seed you got seeded for you."
,theblackthumb,2012-06-06T20:18Z,"(Update) I've found another computer to seed from, so we will have a total of 270kb/s upload. Thank you for your patience. This thing is a beast to upload."
,p0ffski,2012-06-06T20:48Z,Hi! Thank you for upload =) I just wonder 1 thing. Why is this only 180gig? The other one i found is 320gig...
,p0ffski,2012-06-06T20:52Z,"If its full version, i will be greatfull and help seed with 2mb/s."
,theblackthumb,2012-06-07T00:26Z,"K it is the full version. When you purchase Komplete 8 Ultimate, it comes on a 320GB hdd, and the torrent you speak of is just a clone of the hdd with no compression. What I have done is, taken that hdd image and compressed it. So it saves 140GB. There is only 180GB of actual data on the hdd. So to answer your question it is the full version. It works on windows and mac(it is a hybrid .iso)."
,Davesterio,2012-06-07T00:27Z,"Starting this week long download...
Hope it works on Mac
PLEASE SEED"
,Davesterio,2012-06-07T00:41Z,"Forgot to add, thanks so much for this!"
,p0ffski,2012-06-07T01:07Z,"Allrite =) Tnx for fast answer mate. I will seed when i get it. Just keep it open, better slow then never! :)"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-07T01:33Z,bro its gona be more like a month long download.I only have 100kb/s upload :(
,theblackthumb,2012-06-07T01:34Z,and yes it works on mac
,Davesterio,2012-06-07T01:57Z,"Mine says 1w 3d
Uploading at 200 kbs and downloading at around 1mb"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-07T13:43Z,"(Update)I have seed 12.76GB, so at current time we are at 7% uploaded. Utorrent is be awsome. It will seed faster than max speed (rated for 100kb/s, its uploading at 120kb/s).So hang in there, its slow but steady(ish)"
,p0ffski,2012-06-07T19:45Z,"Shit, gonna take days... get a better internett line man, 200kb/s, like wth... but hey, tnx anyways! will be nice when i first get it.."
,mcalldp,2012-06-08T05:18Z,"This is JUST what I need, thx so much! Buying larger drive Just for this before final install, happy to seed once I get it but it's a LONG wait :-( Anyone close at all yet?"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-08T06:01Z,(Update) I have just passed 18.6 GB uploaded. So we are 10% of the way there. Please comment if you want me to continue updating or not.
,Davesterio,2012-06-08T07:23Z,"Yeah please continue updating!
I just hit 6% after 1d and 7h
Thanks so much(:"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-08T17:14Z,"Question, should I have initial seeding enabled?"
,Davesterio,2012-06-08T18:06Z,"Try it, I'm only getting .2kbs so I'm up for anything"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-08T18:16Z,Your only getting that because I am seeding to 43 people of the 100. Would it be faster if one person with high upload rate downloaded it first?
,p0ffski,2012-06-08T20:35Z,"Its better if you upload it to one person with huge upload line. Then he can seed it much faster when he gets it, and the sooner he gets it the sooner everyone gets it =) Try to check out what peers have the highest uploading on. And try to cut of the people with low uploading. Then it will go alittle bit faster at least  ;)  I think..... :P"
,p0ffski,2012-06-08T20:39Z,"I can step in as a volunteer, with 3.5 mB/s upload capasity. I now have 6.7%, and think im on top of it. Its making it all slower that i only get 9kb/s atm."
,p0ffski,2012-06-08T20:42Z,"Not to seem like an ego here,. but i actually think if you seed it only to me now (cus i have the most % of all) and then my seed will rise. Simpel math =)"
,p0ffski,2012-06-08T20:49Z,Just not sure how to do it.
,p0ffski,2012-06-08T22:53Z,"eta: 27years, 6weeks. YEA! "
,p0ffski,2012-06-08T23:15Z,delete torrent and data? Yes.
,theblackthumb,2012-06-09T06:17Z,(Update) I have seeded 22.0 GB. So we are 12.1% of the way done.
,DL601,2012-06-10T19:15Z,theblackthumb has given me the data on an external hdd and ill be seeding for eternity. I have upload of 500 kb/s so we are going to be chugging right along
,DL601,2012-06-11T01:14Z,I will be added the files to several other seed boxes of mine in a few days so I will be seeded at 800-1000 Kb/s
,jackconcorde,2012-06-11T02:27Z,how the fuk am i suppose to download a big torrent like this without any seeds????????????? O.0
,DL601,2012-06-11T03:27Z,"There is 2 seeders right now, I am one of them so I know for a fact there is."
,theblackthumb,2012-06-11T07:01Z,I am seeding as well idk why it says 0 seeders
,Davesterio,2012-06-11T21:21Z,"Well after 4d 19h I'm at 12.5%
A lot farther than I thought I was ganna be, and now with 2 seeders we can get some faster speeds"
,jpeg002,2012-06-12T02:10Z,"Okay, I'm getting no seeds at all. 
Blackthumb, can you not just upload individual pieces of this. Like upload Battery by itself, and the Reaktor and it' synths. then Massive etc.?"
,Davesterio,2012-06-12T04:03Z,"I'm fine with Kontakt, Massive, FM8, Absynth, Battery, and Guitar Rig"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-12T04:33Z,@jpeg002 I will but it wont be today. It will probably be friday
,theblackthumb,2012-06-12T05:27Z,@jpeg002 actually i cant because it is just one install file sry
,jpeg002,2012-06-12T23:33Z,And how about the cracks?
,theblackthumb,2012-06-13T00:00Z,@jpeg002 what do you mean. All the cracks are in there
,DL601,2012-06-13T00:15Z,I think he means make a torrent of just the cracks and nothing else.
,theblackthumb,2012-06-13T00:39Z,Why would I do that. He can just select the cracks in the download
,jpeg002,2012-06-13T07:56Z,"Uuuuh, yeah, but this download is taking forever. The cracks would be faster and someone could use them for trial versions of specific software they want, instead of having to wait for this. "
,theblackthumb,2012-06-13T14:33Z,"Here are just the cracks

,jpeg002,2012-06-13T21:44Z,My man!
,Davesterio,2012-06-14T21:05Z,theblackthumb what % are you at for uploading?
,nyceone,2012-06-14T23:17Z,haha mine says 39w haha
,theblackthumb,2012-06-14T23:42Z,"(Update) I have seeded 24.6%(44.5GB) of it. My friend, as of this morning, has seeded 71.1% (128.6GB) of it. I'm guessing he is at 140GB now. "
,DL601,2012-06-15T06:41Z,"Yep, I am at 147Gb/UL right now."
,Davesterio,2012-06-15T19:12Z,So once the full 180.49gb has been uploaded does that mean download speeds will kick up?
,theblackthumb,2012-06-15T19:43Z,I primarily use what.cd and it does on there. I dont know how tpb works but I would assume so
,IXLSoft26,2012-06-16T03:00Z,"I have Native Instruments Komplete 8 All 335GBs ready to ship.

,theblackthumb,2012-06-16T03:27Z,IXLSoft26 is bullshit. It is only 180gb to start off with. It came on a 320GB HDD so it is impossible that it could be 335GB. THIS IS SPAM. DONT CONTACT. FOR ALL WE KNOW HE IS WITH ANTI-PIRACY. I REPEAT DO NOT CONTACT.
,theblackthumb,2012-06-16T07:06Z,@IXLSoft26 please dont spam my torrents trying to sell things that you dont have. Next time do research before you try and scam people out of money. thank you have a nice day.
,DL601,2012-06-16T21:40Z,"OK people, I have seeded 201GB. That should mean download speeds should kick up a little. Though I will keep seeding of course. "
,theblackthumb,2012-06-18T04:43Z,Has anyone finished Downloading yet?
,CookiesKC,2012-06-18T18:02Z,There is only 71.7% of the torrent (70% of the big .iso) available to those of us who are using the trackers listed in the torrent. All of us that have been with this torrent from day 1 are stuck at 71.7% Is this just using us as incidental seeds or will the rest of it be available without the need for a private tracker?
,KettleTeaEarl,2012-06-18T19:04Z,"only to 28%, began three days ago

thank you, and please continue seeding"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-18T19:10Z,@CookiesKC Idk. My friend told me this morning that he had seeded 250GB so its all out there(he has initial seeding enabled)
,KettleTeaEarl,2012-06-18T19:11Z,"only to 28%, started three days ago

thank you, and please continue seeding"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-18T19:11Z,OH btw ill have him take a screen shot to prove he has seeded that much
,KettleTeaEarl,2012-06-18T19:12Z,then we must be patient =}
,KettleTeaEarl,2012-06-18T19:54Z,basic question: do i need to uninstall/remove any previous (and legitimate) NI product installs before extracting/installing (using mac) -- and is there anything 'hidden' by previous installations which must be deleted before this download will work? thanks! =}
,Davesterio,2012-06-18T19:59Z,"I've been going for 1w 5d and just hit 40%
My speeds are all over the place. Never consistant"
,jpeg002,2012-06-18T21:38Z,"I'm also stuck at 71.1%, been going for a week now, kinda want to get this finished."
,theblackthumb,2012-06-18T21:51Z,@KettleTeaEarl I am unsure put I would venture to say no. Just to play it safe. What is the stuff you would be uninstalling? I will check compatibility for you.
,theblackthumb,2012-06-18T21:54Z,"@jpeg002, @CookiesKC. I don't understand why we are seeding from 3 different computers. Just be patient. Bittorrent has a mind of its own so let it do its thing.  "
,theblackthumb,2012-06-18T22:02Z,Would everyone like me to make an install video?
,mcalldp,2012-06-19T06:20Z,"Blackthumb, please get in touch. I have high speed and am still FAR from getting this. I would rather pay for a drive from you and help seed it. I can seed 24/7 on high speed. Let's keep this thing alive!"
,KettleTeaEarl,2012-06-19T08:08Z,"@theblackthumb

- Thank you! They are merely Kontakt 4 and Kore Player.
- Yes, please make an installation video.

,CookiesKC,2012-06-19T12:12Z,"Ok, now I feel like one of those schmucks who is never satisfied. I apologize for my previous post. I should be thanking you for saving me a grand, so... THANK-YOU so very much for your time, effort and this torrent/seed. I guess I  should have realized that there are people out there who enjoy nothing better than disrupting torrents to irritate the downloaders. They d/load with very little or no upload speed and laugh at posts like mine. Or they start in the begining and then remove torrent/delete data. Thus a part of the 201Gb is lost to lamer leeches. Please keep the initial seed going until at least one of us hits 100%. If it's me I will seed until all of us have all of it ;) I am putting max bandwidth into this and monotoring it 20 hrs/day to get-r-done. Again, THANK-YOU for this very improved mutt release!

,theblackthumb,2012-06-19T18:19Z,"@CookiesKC I don't judge anyone who posts on my torrents. Mainly because I cant tell what someone's tone is when they post something. I didn't think you were a schmuck. and yes I completely agree with you on ""I almost lost my mind on the other one"" same here. "
,theblackthumb,2012-06-19T18:20Z,@KettleTeaEarl I will be making an install video and you don't have uninstall the older programs although I don't know why you wouldn't
,theblackthumb,2012-06-19T19:31Z,Making the install video now

,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T15:35Z,@jpeg002 wait i misunderstood you. In my stuff there are cracks in those folders what are you using to unzip it? WinRAR works perfect for me
,jpeg002,2012-06-24T19:01Z,"izip, but ill try and get winrar for mac if I can"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T19:17Z,@jpeg002 I think I will be uploading the cracks unrard  has anyone else finished downloading?
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T19:27Z,"OK, here are mac cracks unzipped  
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7383480"
,jpeg002,2012-06-24T19:31Z,"Got it working, however theres no folder for Reaktor 5, or VST plugins folder,cracking on mac is similar but its not the exact same"
,jpeg002,2012-06-24T19:32Z,Ok I'll try that crack torrent
,jpeg002,2012-06-24T19:34Z,"Ok well I'll try the unrared torrent, see if anything changes, thank you btw"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T19:46Z,Ya no problem
,GodofSoftware,2012-06-24T20:00Z,"yo theblackthumb you missed my comments at the top of this page, read them, the first two at the top of this page"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T20:04Z,@GodofSoftware yes that is my install video download that and y this is taking so long to download is because there are 325 people trying to download with only 21 seeders so just be patient and it will download
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T20:05Z,@GodofSoftware you just need to download the 180GB one
,GodofSoftware,2012-06-24T20:11Z,"oh ok that helps alot, also could you put up another torrent i have in mind? i know of three really good programs but if you want you can just put up the best one of the three, do you wana?"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T20:43Z,what are they
,GodofSoftware,2012-06-24T21:06Z,"well 1 is on www.crypton.com and is called Nitron, these make music, and this one seems could be big and good qaulity music, 2 is on the same wbsite and called Tech House Vol.1 Elastik2 DL and seems to be possibley small, idk but very good sound qaulity, so that ones just as good and the 3rd is on native instruments called Evolve and it's by Heavyocity...but I think the best pick would be the 1st one i mentioned//Nitron"
,jpeg002,2012-06-24T22:19Z,"MAC USERS (I figured it out)
You MUST use a specific .7z archiver to access the mac cracks unless you have the mac version on winrar.
1.Move the contents in the APP folder into the specific folders located in the Native Instruments folder, you know your Massive, FM8 icons etc. (Dont know where the default location is on Macs, I moved mine to the Desktop, but a simple Finder search of ""Native Instrument"" will do the trick. Also even though there is no folder for Reaktor, once you put the app in the general NI folder, it will create one)

2.Go to Library - Audio- PlugIns And everything you need is right there. 

3. Drag the contents of:
 - The AU folder into Components
 - The RTAS folder into DigiDesign
 - The VST folder into VST

And you're done. Loaded up Logic and everything works fine for me.

Again blackthumb you rock for this. I'm making dubstep for daaaaays."
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T22:45Z,k well www.crypton.com does not exist so either your a troll or you put the wrong link
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T22:46Z,"@jpeg002 thank you sooooo much for figuring it out and giving instructions on how to install the cracks. On a side note I love dubstep, you wana upload a song you make?"
,GodofSoftware,2012-06-24T23:17Z,"oh it's www.crypton.net not (com) but (net) it's in japanese but here's the link right to both products 1 & 2, 1 http://www.crypton.co.jp/mp/do/prod?id=35580 and 2 http://www.crypton.co.jp/mp/do/prod?id=35240 and 3 you prob found it's on native instuments, the evolve product..."
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T23:21Z,GodofSoftware all of these come with komplete 8 execpt for tech house

,GodofSoftware,2012-06-24T23:32Z,"haha....that's what i thought, because i seen somewhere i think, that those products looked like they where in the komplete 8 ultimate, but then to check i went to the product and it showed all 50 products it comes with and i thought oh it does'nt come with nitron or evolve, but it does? ok and though what about the techno one can you get that one?"
,theblackthumb,2012-06-24T23:53Z,I looked on all the torrent websites i'm a member of and no none of them have it
,CookiesKC,2012-06-25T00:15Z,"@theblackthumb:  Thank you for providing this wonderful torrent. I began installing it at 9am and just finished testing it out at 6pm. The install was straight-forward and all went flawlessly. I recommend everyone watch the installation video before installing it, and read the readme files. (RTFD;) It saved me from re-install headaches. All plug-ins worked well as I am using VST in Studio One and RTAS in Pro Tools M Powered. The standalones take a bit to load the first time as they acquire the sounds, but with that many of them it's understandable. Patience and RTFD is the key! Again thanks for all you have done to bring a working release to the table. (And it works flawlessly!) You are da bomb!"

,GodofSoftware,2012-06-25T03:57Z,oh no that was only 280mb...that means this 180gb i really don't have space for it...only 105gb space free....so what do i do? possibley deleted uneeded stuff?

So enjoy ! ;)"
,theblackthumb,2012-07-06T15:37Z,@Arri47 welp I think UltimateByte  will defiantly be helping. The only thing I can tell you is limit how much it is seeding as you download(don't let it upload at full speed). When you let it upload at full speed it will cut off download bandwidth on most internet services (unless you just happen to have fiber) if the fastest you can upload is 120kb/s then set you limit to 100kb/s. That has always worked for me. 
,Arri47,2012-07-06T22:12Z,@theblackthumb  Yes I have Fiber....and yes I think UltimateByte is definitely helping now because I am getting around 1mb/s download and 1.2 upload!!  Way better than before wich was like 20kb download lol!   Already at 18% in only 12hrs...THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!  I will return the favor by joining the seeders after this!

I'm glad to help you guys, i was praying for someone with a seedbox or fiber while downloading it myself, so now i want to seed more than ever !  I think i can be glad it took only 3 days for me to get it on the seedbox.

3. Right click in the right window pane and choose New -> String Value
4. Change the name to SNO
5. Double click the entry and set the value to 32293-90310-95194-49904-71939

Ok, I have finished the download, and am seeding for at least a couple of months, however I am having trouble getting it to work on MAC.

Has anyone got it to install on a Mac?

I have got it down to one of the packages being corrupted.

After mounting, I run the install package ""Komplete 8 Ultimate Installer Mac.mpkg"" as Administrator and it executes, but fails at install with a message like treacll got on PAGE 7 of the comments here..

QUOTED:
""trecall at 2012-06-27 00:52 CET:
Anyone else on OSX get ""The installation failed.
The installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance?"" I get this when I try to install the content libraries.""

So I tried to copy it to the local harddrive from the mounted copy, and it fails copying on the package archive named: ""Kontakt Factory Library Library Part 5.pkg""…

So I looked in that package and try to copy individual files, and the file named: ""Archive.pax.gz"" fails to copy, and fails to extract at all with the error: ""The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -50).""

So, i wonder if someone could try extracting that particular file, and let me and everyone else know if it is corrupted for them also?

I believe the rest of the files are intact, but until I get this file, I can't install contact which is the main reason I got this!

I will keep seeding anyway."
,RapstallionJ,2012-07-28T21:19Z,"@dardasatla & @Quantico
Your issues are actually related. For dardasatla, the reason your world instuments (and some orchestral instruments too) are missing is because Kontakt Factory Library Library Part 5.pkg->Contents->Archive.pax.gz is corrupted on the iso. The windows installer just ignores this fact while the mac installer fails as in Quantico7's case. Unfortunately I don't know where an uncorrupted version of this file can be obtained. Also, replacing it may require recreation of the entire iso image, or atleast copying all the data somewhere on your drive and replacing the corrupt file which is difficult to explain to your average user. Quantico7, I don't have access to a mac so I'm not sure how to work around the issue, but I suppose you can still install everything besides the Kontact Factory Library. As for those hackeresque types on windows that still NEED their remained orchestral and world instruments, I have been able to figure out how to recover 2 of 3 files contained in the corrupt Archive.pax.gz .

Warning: If you're not the adventurous type that's familiar with linux, don't bother.
1. mount the .iso under linux
# mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro ""Komplete 8 Ultimate.iso"" /mnt/cdrom
2. decompress the corrupt file as a stream
# gzip -dc ""/mnt/cdrom/kontakt factory library li_005/contents/archivepax.gz"" > ~/archive.pax
ps: you will get an unexpected end of file error
pps: your file name may be different (correct) if you actually have the right encodings installed in your kernel (unlike me) :p
3. unpack the archive
# cd ~ ; pax -r < archive.pax
ps: you will get an end of archive reached message, just quit after.
4. delete corrupted Kontakt Factory Lib_World002.nkx. If kontact tries to use this file it will cause kontact to freeze.
# rm ""Kontakt Factory Library/Samples/World/Kontakt Factory Lib_World002.nkx""
5. copy the files in the ""Kontact Factory Library"" directory to appropriate place on your windows box."

Thanks man, I am very savvy with linux and all of these concepts.

If I had a replacement for the corrupted file(s) to re-download, I would get them and recompile the ISO (with Toast Titanium) and run it from my HDD.

Since i probably wont get that package fixed, what would you suggest is the best way to install everything else? simply go through each package installing them manually from the top?

Cheers for your help."
,Quantico7,2012-07-29T04:33Z,"Ok, I have searched for another copy of the package, and have found one here (remove all spaces, or just search ""Kontakt Factory Library Library Part 5.pkg"" on google):

Well, it appears as though the package i mentioned above is corrupted, so I re-downloaded it from another source as previously mentioned and it was not corrupted, HOWEVER the full installer still had issues.

The problem is that it doesn't tell you specifically what package(s) have the problem, it just fails when installing using the main package installer for mac.

It appears that Windows installations have no problem, just Macs so far I guess.

Just to give you some background, I'm opening Kontakt by going to Devices ->VST Instruments -> Clicking on ""no instrument"" to load one -> Kontakt 5 -> (it asks if I want to create a MIDI track assigned to plugin ""Kontakt 5"") I click ""create"" -> I select an instrument from the left (ex - ""Kontakt Factory Library Cello Ensemble.nki"") -> it pops up on the left in DEMO mode

,tychmc,2012-08-04T02:00Z,"OK!  SO...I figured out what I did wrong and ANYONE ELSE HAVING ISSUES with running these in an audio program like Cubase should try this:  theblackthumb did indeed include all you need to know in the video but the MAJOR thing I overlooked was that you need to ensure that you copy BOTH the 64 bit vst's AND the x86 vst's even if you're using a 64 bit os.  ALSO, ""Take Ownership"" of the registry editor.  If you don't know how, find out.  I found on another site that Kontakt particularly was having issues if you don't ""run it as administrator"".  Well I couldn't ""run as admin"" so I took ownership of it (same thing, I believe...someone please fact-check me on that).  But regardless, IT WORKS in Cubase for me now!  So try that out and make sure that you copy BOTH sets of vst's.  Hope this helps anyone who was struggling with this.  When in doubt, follow directions and try not to over-think it when blackthumb dishes you up something on a silver platter!  ;D"

If your cracked .app files aren't opening, try using the terminal command ""chmod 775"" on the executable file within the .app.

,frustrated,2012-08-13T02:52Z,"Hey all, hoping to find a little help here. 1st off, thanks blackthumb for the share. Okay my question is regarding Ableton. I followed the video to a T, copied over all appropriate files to respective locations but when I try to create and save sounds when using Ableton, it says that its in Demo Mode. I know people have been asking and I dont mean to be another dumb noob but any help would be much appreciated."
,theblackthumb,2012-08-13T05:44Z,"@frustrated did you try this:
OK! SO...I figured out what I did wrong and ANYONE ELSE HAVING ISSUES with running these in an audio program like Cubase should try this: theblackthumb did indeed include all you need to know in the video but the MAJOR thing I overlooked was that you need to ensure that you copy BOTH the 64 bit vst's AND the x86 vst's even if you're using a 64 bit os. ALSO, ""Take Ownership"" of the registry editor. If you don't know how, find out. I found on another site that Kontakt particularly was having issues if you don't ""run it as administrator"". Well I couldn't ""run as admin"" so I took ownership of it (same thing, I believe...someone please fact-check me on that). But regardless, IT WORKS in Cubase for me now! So try that out and make sure that you copy BOTH sets of vst's. Hope this helps anyone who was struggling with this. When in doubt, follow directions and try not to over-think it when blackthumb dishes you up something on a silver platter! ;D"
,frustrated,2012-08-13T06:36Z,"@blackthumb
Thanks for the quick reply. I ended up solving my problem by using RapstallionJ's advice. I am now able to save files no problem. All I did was add SNO registry keys and viola! Thanks again for the awesome share blackthumb and to all that have helped with comments and helped seed."
,ktuba345,2012-08-14T06:06Z,"Hi everyone. I am a Cubase user (Windows 7 x64) and I have installed and kracked it twice, followed the video's instructions to the letter, taken ownership of the registry (to the best of my understanding) and everything is in Demo mode in Cubase, but works fine as a stand alone.  Arrgh!

 @tychmc, maybe you could be more specific about what you did with the registry?

@theblackthumb: Thanks so much for the programs and the videos! You really went above and beyond the call of duty. Gold medal for you."
,IamGT2Z,2012-08-14T14:30Z,"@ktuba345 
Have you tried putting the DLL's in ""C:Program FilesSteinbergCubase 5(or whatever version of Cubase you have)VSTPlugins"""
,ktuba345,2012-08-14T20:42Z,"Ok much better!
@IamGT2Z: Thanks! I copied the ""kracked"" dll's into the folder you suggested. Everything is out of demo mode, except for Absynth. 
I seem to recall earlier in the comments something about a registry entry for Absynth. I will look into that.
Again much thanks to theblackthumb and all the teams that got this torrent to us! "
,ktuba345,2012-08-14T20:49Z,"Yes! Kontakt is working in Cubase.
@IamGT2Z: Thanks, for your advice. I put the ""kracked"" dll's in the folder you suggested and everything is out of Demo mode, except for Absynth 5 Stereo.  : ^ x

Oh and Also what if i was to just use the dll files instead of the installer for fl studio 10 and then place the cracked files into a separate folder?"
,UltimateByte,2012-08-20T16:46Z,"Alright guys, if you get activation issues, just download the standalone apps that are showing demo mode (you can find them on torrentz). Just be careful the version you're using : Take a similar or newer version. To check your version launch the standalone VST (like kontakt) and go to ""about"" or something like that. Cause unlike tychmc, i copied both x64 and x86 .dll (vst) cracks, and it didn't work. Now i can use it perfectly.


I also wanted you to know that y seedbox says : 176x uploaded. :D  It's now uploading at 10mB/s.
Enjoy and seed with me, even at 20kB/s, it's better than nothing."
