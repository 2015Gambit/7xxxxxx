This is a mutt release containing material from:
ASSiGN - All cracks except Kontakt Mac
DNA - Installer
SONiTUS - Retro Machines Mk2
VR - Kontakt Mac crack
Includes Kontakt 5.0.2 Windows registry fix.

The cracks have been repackaged. Some have been pulled from updated installers. This saves over 3 gigabytes and makes the installation of the cracks much easier and faster.

DNA poorly packaged and cloned the hard drive. They released files that needed to be concatenated and then unextracted, and their image isn't compatible with Windows. Their image has been converted to a hybrid filesystem ISO image excluding unused space. This makes the image usable on Windows and saves over a hundred gigabytes of space.

Native Instruments advertises Komplete 8 with Retro Machines Mk2. Komplete 8 Ultimate is additionally advertised as having Solid Mix Series. Neither of these programs were included on their install media when they initially released Komplete 8 and Komplete 8 Ultimate. Solid Mix Series is integrated with the Guitar Rig cracks. The Retro Machines Mk2 install disc is included.
