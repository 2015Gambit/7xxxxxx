A short-lived but incredible tossed-together band including Layne Staley, Mike McCready, John Baker Saunders, and Barrett Martin. The mingled sounds from Alice in Chains vocalist leading Pearl Jam and Screaming Trees band members, they are probably best known for their single, "River of Deceit". This album is definitely worth the download.
