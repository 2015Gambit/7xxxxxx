,hector_10,2012-06-04T20:48Z,Hey can anyone recommend a good conversion to DVD program for these files?
,SockandShoe,2012-06-05T02:06Z,"A-6 There's a very loud sound at the beginning, probably the cameraman setting up but then it's mostly fine. A little quiet so some things are hard to hear but you get most of it. 

V-5 Just like with all cams it's very dark, so quite a few bits are hard to catch but you wind up seeing most of it, and the bits that are hard to see really aren't important anyway. For a cam it's pretty watchable. 

But the movie itself is just terrible. The first 40 minutes feels like the set up for something like Hostel but never gets delivered on, then nothing interesting happens til the last 10 minutes. I wish I could get those first 110 minutes back. "

I second ConvertXToDVD. Here is a link to the torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6398826/Convert_X_to_DVD_v4.1.12.365__amp__keygen__[ak]

I normally just download the movies and copy them to a flash drive, and play them on my XBOX 360. However some DVD Players and TV's support flash drives too."

,K1bbler,2012-06-14T21:56Z,To everyone writing movie reviews. How about you let us judge the movie for ourselves and you keep your redneck comments to yourself. Or maybe checkout a website called imdb.com so you can stage your thoughts in the correct setting so you don't look like a moron.

There called opinions. Don't like em? Don't read em."

Hard to see how someone look when writing an anonymous comment... Who's the moron now? ^^"

you can kinda hear what is being said but it sounds like the audio was recorded in the background though you can hear every movement the person recording makes just fine.
its watchable...if, you can get used to the audio. video is just fine if its a lil dark just up the screen brightness and tweak the contrast."

Audio is horrible, video is watchable."
,fuq247,2012-06-26T00:27Z,"I agree with K1bbler, everybody thinks they are a movie critic. The only movie comments I look for are video and audio quality to see if it's watchable. Everybody has different taste, so I'll decide if I like the movie or not."

Absolutely retarded... Zero common sense for the story line.  Do not recommend.  Seriously, don't watch this."
