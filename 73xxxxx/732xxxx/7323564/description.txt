New features / Changes
----------------------
- Improved .log file output
- New Console Output option
- New Config file support
- New Disable plugins loading option
- New added plugin location "plugins"
- New Force offline option (only in newest EFLC)
- New Restore original save game folder option
- New Custom save game folder support

Notes
-----
Online multiplayer is NOT supported.

Plugins can be stored / used in the "Plugins" folder
but you must create the directory yourself.
An example path..
C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesGrand Theft Auto IVPlugins
Some plugins may not work properly unless
they are in the root folder of the game though.

The patch routines are the same as Listeners version
so this MOD will support all versions of GTA IV and EFLC etc..
Although the new added ForceOfflineMode config option
is currently only working for EFLC 1.1.2.0 (patch 2)

If "ConfigVersion" is changed in xLive.cfg a message
will pop up asking you if you want to recreate the config file.
Also if the config file is missing a default one will be created.


Put the .dll in your games root folder and play :)


And thanks Listener you rock !
