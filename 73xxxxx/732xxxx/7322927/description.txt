Bootable USB flash disks

This software currently only support Windows bootable disk, can work with both BOOTMGR and NTLDR boot mode, can create USB disk with FAT, FAT32, exFAT or NTFS file system. (When you are making a bootable USB disk, suggest you choose the FAT32 file system.)

This program have be tested with WinXP, Win7 PE and WinXP PE bootable ISO image files, it can work fine, the generated USB disk can normally boot the computers. Only a small part of the machines can boot Win7, but can not boot WinXP, these machines will display "NTLDR is missing", for this problem there is no good solution currently.
