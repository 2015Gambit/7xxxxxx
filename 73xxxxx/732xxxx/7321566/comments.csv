Here is the Linksys site which does NOT have ANY downloadable firmware available = homesupport.cisco .com /en-us/support/storage/NSLU2"

In order to actually carry out the upgrade I would suggest the Sercomm 'Upgrade_207_XP.exe' together with an XP machine.  

The end result is that now I have a piece of equipment that I can use.

Thank you no.way! "
