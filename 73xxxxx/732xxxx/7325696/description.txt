New, expanded edition: the world's best full-colour travel guides just got better. This highly illustrated guide encompasses Jerusalem, Western Jordan and the Red Sea and Sinai, all steeped in religious history. From the green hills and sun-drenched coast of Galilee to the sacred sites of Jerusalem's Old City; from the dramatic desert of Wadi Rum to the vibrant reefs of Dahab, there is much for pilgrims and holidaymakers alike. This relaunched edition has new features and three brand new walks, as well as clear maps and extended hotel and restaurant listings.
