PLEASE NOTE: When running the app for the first time you will be required to download additional 4-28 MB to get the best graphics quality for your device.

When you talk to Pierre, he doesn't just repeat your words ... being a parrot, he remembers what you said previously and repeats it later at random.

Thus he combines different parts of your sentences to create new funny ones. Sometimes he repeats just a part more than once and then adds something completely different at the end.

Try talking to Pierre, his responses are always unexpected and extremely hilarious.
