I mean only she can have that perspective with one eye socket 1 inch higher than the other one. Sorry. Nothing constructive today. 90210 isn't just a zip code - it's an epitaph."
,spankdaddy,2012-06-22T18:29Z,"omg wu thats some funny shit and your so friggen right... that eye has bugged me since the 90120 days my gf watched that shit religiously and that chick was suppose to be soooo hot???? ummm hell no :) ok....ill admit that if she took all her clothes off I MIGHT consider it, but ill never know till i see that, heck i might throw up."
,gekiganger,2012-06-22T22:48Z,"Hah, my hate subject from 90120 was always Tori Spelling. The only reason anyone would let her make tv was because her father wrote the damn thing.

Which leads to the one person who could possibly make me cringe more, her brother Randy Spelling, who performed in sunset beach. Mother of god."
,prettynerdy,2012-06-23T00:56Z,"I had to look at her pics to see what you were talking about, but now her wonky eye socket is so obvious. I dunno how I didn't notice it before..."
,BoxcarWillie,2012-06-23T05:20Z,I saw Shannon in a commercial and she had this noticeable gap in her front teeth. I guess the make-up girl was asleep
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2012-06-24T22:51Z,"I used to tell people about her lop sided face years ago, and no one seemed to know what the fuck I was on about. Yeah Tori was the truest of all the munters on that show, and agree with what you say about the brother too. I used to watch Sunset beach, and he was supposed to be like this hot guy with this hot girlfriend. He was the ugliest thing on the whole show."

OMG, what da fuq is this? The first thing that comes to mind when watching this movie is the acting. Corny bad acting. I feel the movie was written by a 10 year old. But directed by an 8 year old. I sat it out, I watched the whole damn thing. I abused this movie in my mind. Low budget, bad acting, just horrible.  "

Glad to see Dr Beckett working again! :)

Those communicators sure look like headsets! What genius thought they would be cool?
The story didn't need them."
