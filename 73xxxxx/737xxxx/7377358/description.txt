RELEASE NOTES

When you, as a young boy, are dropped off to visit your uncle, you
notice somethings wrong. First, hes not there to greet you. Second,
theres the explosion that happened right as you arrived. And third,
the house seems to be even weirder than you remembered it.

Now, your job is to findand ultimately rescueyour uncle, by using his
newest invention, the Interdimensional Shift Device (or IDS), to switch
between dimensions and solve puzzles. That sofa too heavy to move?
Theres a dimension for that Switch to Fluffy Dimension and that sofa
is now light as a feather. Need to get up to a high ledge? Theres a
dimension for that Just switch to Anti-Gravity Dimension and things
