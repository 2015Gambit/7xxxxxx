,Quasi93,2012-08-25T13:03Z,"Hey guys! I have found the solution how to fix your problems and errors with Ghost Recon Future Soldier. 
1. Copy the crack into game folder.
2. (When u try to run the game, most of the people are getting error.) All u should is right click on game shortcut and run as administrator.
3. As u run it as administrator, the ubisoft log in tab will pop up. First of all click on settings, and tick the box ""start the launcher in offline mode and click apply.
4. Then type in anything in some random crap in username and password, tick remember me box below and click log in
5.Then the error will come up ""Cannot play in offline mode blah blah blah, just click ""PLAY!"" and the game will start.
Tell me if it works for u 
Enjoy!!!"
