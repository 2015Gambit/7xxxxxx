Read the next line if you aren't sure where to install the data for this game.
If you look @ /Android/Data/com.sony.playstation.[PSX Title ID]/files/ucc/preferences.xml you'll find the settings for the emulator, one of which is ""On-screen Controller"". I haven't tried it but sounds promising. The folks over at
forum.xda-developers.com might have some info about this. "
