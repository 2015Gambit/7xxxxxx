"9/11 Explosive Evidence: Experts Speak Out - Final Edition Premiere"

with Richard Gage.


Scientific forensic evidence of controlled demolition of both World Trade Center Twin Towers, as well as Building 7, on September 11th, 2001; the broad geopolitical and domestic political implications of this scientific evidence; its significance in terms of the institutions and legal framework that has evolved in its wake; the wars these events have spawned. As well, the psychological impediments to incorporating this evidence into our worldview, and testimony from survivors and families of those who perished.




================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.
