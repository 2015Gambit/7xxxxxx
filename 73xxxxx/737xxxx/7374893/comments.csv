,Seancpconn,2012-06-23T22:07Z,"Hey guys!

Just logged in just to help everyone out!

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed.

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.
8. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!"
