,kremisos,2012-08-25T04:17Z,"@jamesensor - Really????  Do you just blatantly ignore the last line of these games details?  For fuck's sake man, the game you've asked about is $5.99.  If you already know it's a great game, then why are you asking someone to upload it instead of purchasing it?  I could see if it was expensive and you just couldn't afford it yet, but I'm sure you could find something to do on fiverr.com if you were really that hard up for money and desperate....  =/"
