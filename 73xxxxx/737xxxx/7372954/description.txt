Using the gameΓÇÖs new Web Rush mechanic, players can pull off a vast array of moves never before possible. With a story that takes players through many areas all over (and under) Manhattan, fans will feel what itΓÇÖs truly like to be a Super Hero, as they experience the cinematic adrenaline rush of web-swinging through the city and fighting crime using Spider-ManΓÇÖs spectacular acrobatic moves and attacks.
