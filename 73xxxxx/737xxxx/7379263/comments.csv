,ivo1978,2012-06-30T08:45Z,"Huge thanks for Nepotu's efforts. As for the finals - I was disappointed of a quality of a plays and i think for most of game their is a 8 Heat (5 players + 3 officials) again 5 Thunders (I'm nor heat nor thunder fan) so I think David Stern had already decided that this will be a Heat title. Still - nobody says - ""I wan to be like LeBron as they say back to 90'- I want to be like Mike, or likr Magic or Bird..., so this tells everithing for the level of today backetball. I hope thta Nepotu will send us again back to past with some great games from old times. "
[V],Nepotu,2012-07-04T11:34Z,"Thank you, my dearest friends for your words. I'll try to bring here some old games with or without Pistons or Bulls. Also, I was disappointed of some calls of the officials. Mike was the greatest players of the NBA History. Now, I think the best active player is Kobe, but he don't have a great team like LeBron or Durant. See you!"
