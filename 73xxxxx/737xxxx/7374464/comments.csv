,cyborg34573,2012-06-22T07:12Z,"@qksekf33

You're an idiot, Skidrow is one of the best scene groups out there, all of their releases have always worked for me. To why they are not working for you i have no idea, maybe you are just too retarded to actually figure out how to apply their cracks properly or your computer is a piece of shit.

But you really are retard to even say they have never cracked any DRM. Do you know who cracked the hardest DRM to crack so far?, SKIDROW. That DRM was in Assassins Creed Two made by Ubisoft, took them months to crack it but they did it, it was a new type of DRM, the game needed to be constantly online because it needed to download key files off the main server on the fly in order for the game to progress, this was a real challenge for scene release groups and it was Skidrow who cracked it by emulating servers at first, but then a proper crack came out shortly after.

So STFU when you dont know shit about what you're talking about. Skidrow is a good team and so far their DRM cracks work just fine."
,dralex21,2012-06-22T07:37Z,"Ok, I've got this, installed, copypasta from skidrow folder to game folder, started game, user SKIDROW, password random, and it doesn't work.  "
,cyborg34573,2012-06-22T08:05Z,"@dralex21

The NFO says
"" 7. Type anything as password and put a mark in ""remember me"" ""

did you do that?. If that does not work you must have not properly pasted over the crack. If it asks you to replace files when you are copying the crack files over, tell it to overwrite the original files. If it doesn't even ask you if you want to replace files then you might be pasting them in the wrong location."

1st: It will not work on win-XP in it's current state (nothing to do with the torrent) Ubisoft have said that a Patch will be released to enable Win-Xp support in the coming weeks.

2nd: It SEEMS (can't confirm until iv'e Installed it myself) that the Skidrow release will -NOT- work on x64 Win7 ,Ive seen a few posts about this on forums/releaselog 

And Again thx for the UL, ive pre-ordered it cheap just for the sake of MP, but since Ubi decided to post-pone it again, i'll happily play trough SP now :D"

,hollywdq,2012-06-22T11:46Z,"Hey guys! 

Just logged in just to help everyone out!

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed. 

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.
8. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!

Hope this helps y’all. 

Trust me this method works. "

I dunno if I have a compatibility mode I can't see running, but I'm on Win 7 x64 and it's working beautifully. Played through 4 or so missions already. Could it be related to installing it on your OS partition in the x64 bit Program Files folder (I doubt it but maybe)?

I believe the game does not work on Windows XP for now because the game is only Directx10/11, and XP is only Directx 9, for now you will need Windows Vista or Windows 7 to play the game.

That sounds like a video card or resolution problem.
A: Your video card might not be powerful enough for the game
B: The game is running at a resolution too high for your monitor, in this case it would give an error saying ""Out of Range"" Or ""Mode not supported"" etc.
C: Game is forcing a Refresh Rate that is too high for your monitor."

I think i know what's going on here now.

There are two methods that work.
1. Is if you only copy orbit files into Ubisoft Game Launcher and completely ignore the there other files (worked for me)
2. Is if you paste the orbit folder and three files inside the game folder instead and put nothing in the Ubisoft Game Folder (blaze's method)

And yeah get with the times, support for XP will officially stop next year i believe so dont be surprised developers are forgetting about it. I have nothing against XP users, its a great OS no doubt, but its old/aging, Windows 7 after all the updates is a much better OS than XP in features and performance. And if your PC cant run Windows 7 properly then its time for a hardware upgrade definitely.

But yeah XP support is going to be patched in this game later on so XP users just need to be patient. But honestly if you want to continue gaming in the PC you really have to think about changing to Windows 7. We are on piratebay come on, just get yourself a copy of Win 7 free."

 So people who did update it as per the instructions are probably not having issues. Those that did not are having a ton of issues.

Even if the gamepad is NOT plugged in, you may still have the issue of not being able to look around with the mouse, but mouse in menus work fine.

My problem was having the NOSTROMO installed on win7 x64.  TO FIX:

1. Go to START MENU-CONTROL PANELS-DEVICE MANAGER

2. Click on HUMAN INTERFACE DEVICES

3.  Look for RAZER NOSTROMO or any other gamepad driver, [Right Click], and DISABLE.

4.  Start GRFS

Menus should now show PC keyboard buttons instead of Xbox controller buttons.

At least for the RAZER NOSTROMO, it is not necessary to re-enable the driver in device manager while playing.  I've been able to run the NOSTROMO CONFIGURATOR and play other games using the Razer Nostromo without having to re-enable the driver.

,tofumunch,2012-06-24T17:44Z,"found this on the non-publicHD page: 

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed.

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.
8. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!

Set the config file to ""read-only"" so anything you put in it cannot be overwritten. How you do this, basically just right click the files - Properties - Tick the box that saids ""Read-Only"" then hit apply (Make sure you have made and saved the changes you wanted to make in it first though before setting it to read-only, because when its in read-only you cannot add/change anything in it unless you untick Read-Only).

I think you are right about the problem being on my end but I can't think of anything else to try. I can hear the game running and it does advance when I guess and press Enter or spacebar.

 I experience that with both the Skidrow and BB repack. Actually the BB repack also just freezes on me, too.

 That is where this gets crazy, because that shouldn't work. The Orbit folder needs to exist in both places, but it already does when you install UBI game launcher. The BlackBox version does not add it to that folder, either. When I did to try and fix this version it simply would not run anymore at all.

 Glad it works for you, but it didnt for me. The game wouldnt run at all after that.

 Anyhow I can confirm that the ""Device is removed: device due to badly hung Formed commands"" does have to do with an overclocked GPU. Mine is a factory overclocked GTX570 and I upped my voltage and now the game works. Lowering my voltage caused the game to crash immediately.

 So that particular error has to do with overclocking and voltage, and can be solved easily. Use MSI afterburner and add just a small amount of voltage."

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed.

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:

5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.

,bzjgto,2012-07-09T08:51Z,"Game isn't worth the download.  It's a complete console port, and a poorly done one at that.

Disconnect any joysticks, throttles, or controllers you aren't using.  The game automatically mapped my view to my flightstick and throttle and there are no options to disable controllers/stick or the ability to remap the axes.

I also had load times of over a minute despite having a relatively modern computer and the game installed on a SSD.

Don't waste your time with this."

,tpw1314,2012-07-29T02:08Z,"For all people above who are having ubisoft or futuresoldier.exe 'Not/Stop working'...
Solution : 1. Install the game.
2. do not crack it 1st, update the game. (to 1.1 or 1.3, if it doesnt close automatically, press quit after update patch downloaded and installed)
3. Then copy over all content from Skidrow/orbit to Ubisoft launcher folder. (Do not copy 3/4 files from Skidrow folder, it wont work)
4.Now start the game, it should prompt up a window ask for username and passwd, here follow the instruction that skidrow have provided.
5. press login. and volla !

Oh and before you go on to step 4, you can download the fixed files/new crack files followed by the update from ubisoft. Just go to gamecopyworld.com, search for tom clancy ghost recon future soldier and download the fixed/new crack files from skidrow. It will be named as '[Multi10] 1.1/1.2/1.3 Fixed files'.
Same, copy only content from orbit folder to ubisoft launcher folder, do not copy skidrow.dll and others ! (otherwise it wont work.)"

******************************************
If your FutureSoldier.exe or UbisoftLauncher is not running properly as in not appearing or not working then follow read below:

1: Download and mount the image and run the setup app to install it
2: Copy and replace the 3 files in the Skidrow folder and everything in the orbit folder as well into the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder.
3: Run the gu executabe in the Tom Clancy's Future Soldier folder to update the game. Keep running it until like 1.3 or 1.4 or until it just runs and disappears. That means it is up to date.
3: Restart the computer.
4: Now repeat step 2 in copying and replacing everything from the Skidrow folder into the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder.
5: Run the FutureSolder.ece and it should run.  If it doesnt run, try restarting it.If you get a error in the log in screen. for the password, enter in SKiDROW (it is CASE SENSITIVE!) and log in.  And you should be in.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7538683/Tom_Clancys_Ghost_Recon_Future_Soldier_v1_4_Update-SKIDROW


steps to take after you install the above torrent:

1.) go into the skidrow folder.
2.) go into the ""orbit"" folder, highlight everything, cut & paste into the 1.4 folder. (skip the duplicate files. ((should only be 2 files)). )
3.) move all the ""skidrow"" files into the ""skidrow"" folder. you dont need them
4.) go back into the 1.4 folder and copy everything except the ""skidrow"" folder.
5.) paste it all into your Ghost Recon Future Soldier folder. replace all files.
