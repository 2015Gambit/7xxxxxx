,KevinCostner,2012-06-22T22:32Z,First few seconds of the movie are missing but the audio if much better than the others.  It the best one I've found so far.
,blombardo,2012-06-28T04:11Z,A 8 V8 (for a Very nice cam - )  if compared to a dvd then it would be A4V4.  Shame there is no beginning or ending credits - not sure exactly how much is missing.  1H 22M
,metalmonkey47,2012-06-28T16:06Z,THIS TORRENT IS TRACKED. Download at your own risk. I just got an email from my ISP about a pending suit with this torrents name specifically.

,Bijuu,2012-07-12T12:31Z,@Metalmonkey47 You should probably look into a way of making it so your ISP doesn't know you're doing illegal downloads :P
