,gorgio60,2012-06-23T01:29Z,"It is in Greek language,from ERT HD channel."
,fall1en,2012-06-23T07:04Z,"Thanks, but darn. Would love this to be in English. You're the only up loader, that's giving us 1080p quality files.

Thanks anyway! "
,fall1en,2012-06-23T07:07Z,"Correction,......1080i. Don't actually understand the diff, cause I haven't done a search on it."
,gorgio60,2012-06-23T13:11Z,"It is 1080i and not p,because it's from tv and it differs in frame rate,that's all..."
