,Whimsic,2012-06-23T13:29Z,"Hi, this doesn't work for me.

When I join server I get stuck at ""wait for host"" message.

If anyone has an idea how to get around this, feel free to share."
,Conan_513,2012-06-23T13:38Z,wait for the server to load the mission :)
,Whimsic,2012-06-23T14:07Z,"Thanks for the reply Conan, how long does it take for you?
I left it sitting there for 20 minutes and nothing happened"
,Conan_513,2012-06-23T14:25Z,"ohm o.O
on my amd x2 5000+ 4gb ram pc its only 1-2 minute"
,Whimsic,2012-06-23T14:30Z,"As an update, I can join online servers without any problems"
,Whimsic,2012-06-23T14:46Z,"Also I can logon as admin and change map/mission on the server, and it will load and play OK. Only seems to be DayZ thats failing for me"
,Conan_513,2012-06-23T15:18Z,Whimsic you have steam version of arma 2 or you have the jimbus's Combined Operations?
,usasoldier52,2012-06-23T15:21Z,"conan ur my hero, will try now and post the results"
,usasoldier52,2012-06-23T15:25Z,"If u get stuck with waiting for host thing and get kicked all the time, just use the default character. If u make others it will fail"
,Whimsic,2012-06-23T15:56Z,"Hi Conan,

I have the steam version.

I just want to be able to play offline.
Also, I forgot to mention, when I run either of the cmds i get a couple of error messages, CABuildingParts and a citizenscope1.

Did some research and seems to have something to do with it needing to be run in Combined Operations? Do I need to download jimbus's CO?"
,usasoldier52,2012-06-23T16:00Z,"It does not save, i went into a 1.7 game and used a bandage then aborted reconnected and i had a new one, should i join the no cheat, no cd key servers?
those are 1.6 so im not sure. Could u give a more clear instruction after the instalation?"
,usasoldier52,2012-06-23T16:35Z,"Whimsic, if u just wanna play offline then download the dayz sp, google it and u will find it. It comes with cheats as well for example u can spawn a heli or guns. And conan, I cant use this torrent I tried like 8 servers and I cant save. pls help."
,Conan_513,2012-06-23T16:36Z,"Whimsic it's looks like doesn't work with the steam version
try create a new folder and copy in the arma 2 and the OA then this server files or download the jimbus CO 

if the server start you can join with the steam version and can start a server online"
,usasoldier52,2012-06-23T18:13Z,"It does not save,Could u give a more clear instruction"
,segata_66,2012-06-23T21:07Z,"works perfectly, thank you Conan_513.

,Persnoody,2012-06-23T21:38Z,"Working great for me, been hosting a server for about half the day now and still going, I personally haven't had any problems. Although, I have had many people complain saying that their character is invisible and can't see any zombies, most of the people I ran into I could see, but there was one person who really was invisible. I am guessing it is a problem on his end since it isn't happening to everyone, any thoughts?"
,Persnoody,2012-06-23T21:40Z,"P.S. do you know how to turn voice chat on for the mission? it appears to be coded off, I did notice there was no radio in the map screen, that must be it, any help would be great."
,segata_66,2012-06-23T23:21Z,"@Persnoody
If someone is invisible they didnt install arma beta patch"

,Persnoody,2012-06-24T04:49Z,"Hmm yeah that is what I was thinking, more info on it, one player had that happen, then figured out he didn't launch the game from the right exe, leading me to believe that the one he tried first didn't have the link to the beta patch, at least this way it will be easy to explain. I might want to set a script up to kick people who don't have the same files as me, like the patch and everything.

Oh and about the in game voice, found it, it was in the servercfg file."
,anon86753,2012-06-24T06:39Z,i can join dayz games but when i try to host one it 'come up as one of the missions . did i do something wrong?

,vragoslav,2012-06-25T00:40Z,"So i need to wait whole night to start playing on server i read somewhere dath game features realistic day-night cycles.
Help please, and great work Conan.."
,vragoslav,2012-06-25T01:55Z,"Lol sory for spaming i actualy fixed problem with night time whic i had, the server takes the time from pc on whic is server. I trayed to play the game in 23:00 so each time i loged in wos night. So i changed time on pc where wos the server and fixed the problem XD

Tho did not trayed to play LAN whic wos my actual plan but i think it will work.

Hire is what i did to make it work.
1. dowloaded and instaled the Joe Smith iso images
2. downloaded files on this torent extracted files and folders into arma2 
3. Start the server with server.bat
4. Start the game with dayz_game.bat

And all works perfectly thank you so much conan now the poor people can play best mod ever made..

 Could someone point out, when selecting the dayZ mod from the main menu what is the order I ""should"" be selecting. "
,frajer990,2012-06-26T08:45Z,"Conan it works well, thanks.
But I think that saves should be saved on local computer of every player. Because when you switch server, you must start from the beginning :("
,Conan_513,2012-06-26T13:05Z,frajer990 your right it save for local because it's a lan server :D
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2012-06-26T14:17Z,"To anyone who still has problems playin singleplayer...
first u start the server with server.bat (should b in ur main game folder,as is the next file), the server starts in window and then u start another game session with dayzgame.bat file, go to multiplayer, change to lan sumwhere down left, u should now see the server in the list, good luck. Make sure u turn mysqld (and any dayz related exe's) off in windows firewall. 
Thanks Conan. Works perfect."
,vadzimka,2012-06-26T16:58Z,It works great just I want to ask how to enable vehicles in my  server. I checked locations where they should be but didn't find any for 2 days already.
