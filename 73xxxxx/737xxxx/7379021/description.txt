As the Summer Vengeance Tournament heats up each battle gets more and more intense. Iona Grace got lucky and was automatically moved past her 1st opponent in the championship when Gia DiMarco was disqualified. But is she prepaired to take on Rain "Poison" Degrey? 

 

Both wrestlers train hard off the mat, but Rain is bigger and stronger than Iona, with more wins under her belt. In order to proceed in the tournament Iona will have to overcome great odds. Can she move forward and fuck Rain's face all over the mat? Or will she be the one getting pounded with a strap-on and sent home for the season a loser?
