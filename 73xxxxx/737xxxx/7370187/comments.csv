,MisaTange,2012-06-21T02:05Z,"Completely safe when I downloaded it (using Avast, which warns a file/website is a virus even when it has a scrape of a virus, at least on websites). Works as well. Just be sure, when running the keygen, to click on the small arrow pointing down (not the green one) to generate the keygen. Thanks Android!"
