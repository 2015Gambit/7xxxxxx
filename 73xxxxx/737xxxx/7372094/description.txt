Nicely done tale of an RAF officer, Redgrave, who hears of a dream that the airplane on which he and some others are flying will crash in snow and darkness -- then watches as the mosaic falls into place.


This has to be one of the better British films of the fifties, as director Leslie Norman nicely builds up the tension notch by notch, allowing occasional respite as the main characters deliberate on superstition and rationality, fate and predestination, the power of dreams. Michael Redgrave is all cool rationality, Denholm Elliot repressed anxiety, and Alexander Knox the sceptic who becomes increasingly unhinged by fear, then philosophically resigned to the inevitable. It's a welcome addition to the list that will never make it as an in-flight movie. If you're nervous about flying, don't watch it.
