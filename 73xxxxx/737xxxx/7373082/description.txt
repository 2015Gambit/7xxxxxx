FileMaker Pro has a legendary history as a Mac database. It takes advantage of features of the Mac OS, like Advanced Find. It integrates with other leading Mac applications, like Excel, Numbers, and AppleWorks spreadsheets. And the FileMaker Pro Mac database uses the same Mac interface (menus, dialog boxes, etc.) you're already familiar with.
