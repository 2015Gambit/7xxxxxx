I really appreciate all the hardwork that goes into sharing this stuff, but this is false advertising... simply reencoding an mp3 that was originally encoded at 256Kbps at a higher bit rate does not return the data that was lost during the original lossy compression.

This is just a 256Kbps file that has been reencoded at 320Kbps!"
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-06-30T20:24Z,Uhm... No shit? If I would have uploaded this in 256 kbps I would have gotten 10 seeders. You can get the original files if you want... Just contact me at Kat.
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-07-02T19:03Z,"9/10 of the music torrents that you see in 320 kbps is ripped from a shitty web source or iTunes/Similar stores, which all comes from a lower bitrate than 320 kbps. There is not very many legit 320 kbps that either comes from FLAC or CD."
