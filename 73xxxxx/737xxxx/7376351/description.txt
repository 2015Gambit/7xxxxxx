Jam band veterans String Cheese Incident have issued their first new song in seven years. ΓÇ£CanΓÇÖt Wait Another DayΓÇ¥ was written by keyboardist Kyle Hollingsworth ΓÇö ΓÇ£an Afro groove that had been flying around in my brain for awhile,ΓÇ¥ he told Billboard ΓÇö and serves as the first of many new tracks coming from the band.

ΓÇ£We are in the process of working on some material for a new album, but we just wanted to release this piece that was closest to being done just to get some hype and build some excitement for our summer shows,ΓÇ¥ Hollingsworth explained to Billboard. ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs a promotional tool, but we really like it and we wanted to get people excited for the summer and let them know weΓÇÖre working on new material. ItΓÇÖs been awhile. WeΓÇÖve been putting out live CDs for quite awhile nowΓÇª But I think the whole band is ready to release new material, and we know our fans are waiting for it.ΓÇ¥
