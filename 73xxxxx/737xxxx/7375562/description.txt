Description:

Script Debugger ΓÇô Makes AppleScript Easy
We too appreciate AppleScriptΓÇÖs ability to let you automate repetitive and time consuming tasks. But much like entering a maze at night, using AppleScript requires some guesswork ΓÇö and plenty of feeling around in the dark. Script Debugger flips on the lightswitch so you can see whatΓÇÖs in front of you. It gives you more than a flashlight, it gives you daylight.
