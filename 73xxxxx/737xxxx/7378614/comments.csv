,seshwan84,2012-06-23T22:02Z,is the audio for this not off by at least 30 minutes after the first fight? The first fight is shown twice but the audio keeps going and you hear the audio for the next fight during Swanson's repeated fight. I hear the intro's for the final fight halfway through while watching supposed previews.
