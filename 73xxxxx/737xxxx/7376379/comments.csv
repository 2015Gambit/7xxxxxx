,wermaxta,2012-06-22T21:40Z,which program you are using to make the Wordlist :))))
,wermaxta,2012-06-22T22:14Z,"stepking2 what do you mean with  ""Heard about compression???"""
,wermaxta,2012-06-22T22:22Z,stepking2 next time i will use better compression :)
,stepking2,2012-06-23T01:22Z,"I use Crunch to make them, then I use the ""Best"" compression option in WinRAR.

What I mean about ""Heard about compression?"" is that you could compress them, if you already have compressed them, compress them better, so you just had to download less data to get the file. 

As you see in this torrent, I compressed this file 102GB down to 2GB. That's a good example ;-)"
,wermaxta,2012-06-23T08:02Z,stepking2 thank you for advice:))
,wermaxta,2012-06-23T13:54Z,stepking2 did you have twitter :)
,MasterRaider,2012-06-26T00:15Z,"@stepking2 YOU ARE SO BOSS, I would really really appreciate if you make a step by step tutorial (Noob Friendly) on how to make a Dictionary file/Wordlist, how to filter out Duplicates, Compression, and anything relevant.

I always wanted to upload stuff like this and create a ""Master Dictionary File w/ no dupes"", but I have a busy life, I'm a BT5 user too but never have the time to learn more and deal with the headaches or trail and error. I usually let my PC crack ivs when I'm not using it.

BTW if you make one then put a Bitcoin Address on it because I am willing to donate :)"

,nahoverli,2012-07-05T18:27Z,"Please Mr stepking2

I don't understand how to access ""10Digit.lst"" under windows.

Exist under Windows a program to access your wordlist-dic?"

,stepking2,2012-07-15T18:15Z,"You won't be able to open it, because no consumer has 100GB of RAM, and I don't know any program that can handle 100GB text files.

AirCrack-ng will handle it though :-)"
