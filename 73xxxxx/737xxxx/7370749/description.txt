The title says it all: This torrent was created for only one purpose and that is to create a USB installer stick for OSX lion from within windows or linux (for example if you had osx running on a HDD and it crashed while you had no backup of your USB installer somewhere on a usb stick - or you would like to try OSX, however you have no access to a Mac / AppleStore and even if you would like to purchase it and/or create the USB stick you are unable to do so because the right hardware is not at hand). So - this torrent is the answer to your prayers.

Requirements: A 8 GB USB Stick

Instructions:

Torrent contains 2 files - lion.iso and ImageWriter.exe

Launch ImageWriter.exe ... on the bottom it will probably already have recognized and selected your USB stick, hit select ... now the "hard part" lol - it allows you to select only files with the extension ".RAW" ... either rename lion.iso to lion.raw or - easier just type in the select field *.iso ... this will allow you to select the lion.iso as it is (recommended) 

Now wait until the write process is finished ... after that you can reboot your system and select the USB stick and just boot from it.

WHat I have posted here has been tested on Windows 7 with an entirely empty USB stick ... write completed perfectly ... reboot was fine as was the installation from the USB stick. If you guys have any problems and/or questions - ask. Cheers.
