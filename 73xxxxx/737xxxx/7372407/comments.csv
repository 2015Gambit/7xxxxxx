Please upload other guides from this maths series, especially calculus and algebra . Thanks."

,ut1880h,2012-07-22T17:28Z,"I have found that that Linear Algebra forms the foundation of just about every more advance form of mathematics. It is The Gateway - especially for the mathematics that underlies physics. This book is VERY user friendly. It is designed to construct UNDERSTANDING in the mind of its readers. That is the key - it is also what most standard LA texts fail to accomplish. I lived in Gilbert Strang (MIT). If I'd had this book as well, Strang would've been a cinch.

Thank you very much to the original uploader and all seeders. Knowledge empowers one to traverse efficient paths toward understanding. It sets the mind free, even when one's life is imprisoned by the other forms of common human bondage. "
