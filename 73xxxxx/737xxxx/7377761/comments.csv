,DaftMink,2012-06-23T02:05Z,Pictures less blocky then ADTRG's plus it has the opening so guess this is the best release so far.
,KevinCostner,2012-06-23T15:47Z,How is the audio on this one?
,DaftMink,2012-06-23T18:14Z,"Audio:
There's 3 different audio's used, 2 in the first 40 seconds (one is good other is shit), then the main movie audio which is nice except for one of the songs were there's crackling."

,madturki,2012-06-25T04:54Z,This is a CAM btw - NOT TS
,Primon9,2012-08-03T17:50Z,@ madturki What do you think a TS is exactly you fucking idiot? Tele Sync describes the way the audio was synced to the CAM video. Dumb ass.
