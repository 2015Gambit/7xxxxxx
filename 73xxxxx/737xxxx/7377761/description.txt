Notes -

K 1st for the reason for READNFO... 
is still missing the end credits stuff..
Had to use 40 sec of our CAM audio at the very beginnijng then the rest is ADTRG's nice LiNE
(nice job guys).. took the vobs, crop, rotate perspectives out he slight fishbowl affect
then was onto denoising, coloring and blah blah.. then just appeneds the 2 sep vid parts
and boom.. very nice encode.. enjoy til R5 or HD CAM comes out....
Enjoy!!
