Note: right not a very good source but
it is the first sor, did what i can to
revive it rotated, prespective, resized,
cropped, gamma, contrast, levels, colour,
sat, medium denoisers to reduce some of
that unwanted crap in the pixels, gave it
a little sharpen and KAPOW much better but
not the greatest either one for the cam
lovers

Note2: HC chinese subs thought-out,
cropped alot, plus i think there is
missing minutes unless the runtime
is different for the chinese viewing
i recommend u view on pc/laptop 50%
of the movie is blurred due to the 3D
plus there is a couple of dark spots
no biggie but, HOPE you Enjoy 

Apart from all this you will still laugh
