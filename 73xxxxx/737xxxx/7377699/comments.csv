Wtf?"
,C0MMANDAH,2012-07-06T07:39Z,"While it's downloading, I might want to add to you that Railworks 3 has its own defense system. After unzipping and installing the last torrent for it I got a popup saying, ""Log in to Steam"" but of course I don't own it on Steam, the fix that came with it didn't work. I hope this one's different. I'll report some feedback once I get it going."
,C0MMANDAH,2012-07-06T19:32Z,"People, do not download. This is a waste of time, not enough seeders. My download has stopped at 78%, since nobody will get to 100% in the near future I will stop seeding. Sorry, but I don't want to get caught for no good. (It's the seeding that gets ya)"
,neeme55,2012-07-22T14:58Z,Quick download & workin'g 100%
,Jizz_Jet,2012-08-01T10:00Z,"This works perfectly for me, thanks!

Must ask though, there is quite a size difference between this and the SKIDROW version.

Is anything missing?

Thanks"
