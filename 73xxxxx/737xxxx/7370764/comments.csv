For the past three days, ever since this was first uploaded, it's been stuck at ~80 leeches and no seeds in spite of the fact that two seeds are claimed.  All leeches are stuck at 6.7% download.  I wonder if this uploader is a spammer since all of their uploads' claimed screenshots are links to a site which requires registration and login."
