2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

In September of 2011, I thought it might be a good idea to start gathering together, and sharing all of my Christian music released in that 2011 calendar year.  Of course I wasn't sure if anyone would be interested in downloading any of it, but it was still indeed something that I had prayed on before doing.  By the end of that year, I had grouped together 32 different 2+ gig bundles which accounted for 837 Christian releases.  It was my goal to reach 1,000 releases in 2011, but I fell short of that perhaps because of my late start.

Today, I'm currently sharing my 21st bundle of "2012 - The Year In Christian Music."  Combined, all 21 bundles account for 558 Christian Music releases at some point in time year.  I pray that the Lord is leading you in doing your part to share the message in this music as well, as He has me.

The 27 titles in this 21st bundle today include...

 * Andy Tallman - 2012 - Hope Rise
