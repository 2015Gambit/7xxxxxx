I only posted this as a fix to your torrent, which left me with four files which would not play on my friends' old DivX enabled DVD player.

I've already got >36 Seeds in Peer Exchange, so I think this torrent is desireable.

Thanks again for the excellent upload FaMoUz.  Only the mp4 files were problematic and even they are of great quality for users with any clue what they're doing.

@Hegemoney & @FaMoUz
I've seen many fixes and reposts advertised in major torrent feeds.  It's a good thing.  It's not as if I linked to some outside site or talked trash. I respect your uploads and am not trying to steal your spotlight, just sharing a more consistent collection for those who wish to avoid MP4.

In short, I stand by this upload and I stand by my comments on your pages.  Please don't complain about helpful comments and links on your torrent pages!

No worries man, I'm very thankful to you regular uploaders and all the release groups for posting these.  TV is a PITA anymore and I rely heavily on folks like yourself to get quality programming.

So far I have only posted rares, fixes, and a couple collections.  (I'm happy to see my 200gb Star Trek collection is finally Seeding efficiently.  I had a really hard time getting it to upload here.)

TPB is the first place I look for anything unavailable through official channels.  How else would I watch the BBC Dirk Gently 3-part series?  Or find legit apps that are out of circulation due to deprecation by useless upgrade bundling?  (Looking at you, free Adobe Acrobat print driver.)

Thanks again to all Seeders, this torrent is flying now!  I'd ask someone to post A:V quality, but I already know they look good."

I will continue to seed both versions, but please DO NOT DOWLOAD THIS OLD VERSION, get the new one.

@Hegemoney
Yes, please do upload your 720p XviD transcode!  This series deserves the best image quality available, in each format.  Feel free to post the link to your new version both here, and on my PROPER repack page when it is available.

Until the BRrips come out, here's my best effort!

Once again, PLEASE GRAB THE NEWER VERSION INSTEAD...
