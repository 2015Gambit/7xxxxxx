,Whitebb,2012-06-28T15:32Z,"I've tried only for english, it works for the other languages because the crash in english after patch 1.13 Skidrow. but first u have to pick a language of your in instalation, patches and launcher then start the game."
,Whitebb,2012-06-28T15:35Z,"The file working fine, but the changes in Merc list and Cambria crash from patch 1.13b.

You have to chose your language in:
1. installation
2. patches
3. Launcher
Then it can work. if ur already have other language or patch, Uninstall the game and reinstall by following the steps up there."
,Whitebb,2012-06-28T15:39Z,"Besides, after past the file in game folder you can play the game in full english with patch 1.13a.
(Normal Mrcenaries list, and Cambria playable)"
