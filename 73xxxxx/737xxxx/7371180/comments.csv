,spartacustv,2012-07-10T13:02Z,"@Groinpuss - Don't be so pessimistic. Obama cancelled the space-shuttle program because of the dangers caused by the problematic shield of tiles mounted on the shuttle. The cancelling of the shuttle program was for avoiding other shuttle catastrophes like the space-shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, when all seven astronauts on board died when the shuttle re-entered the atmosphere. 

The NASA space program is continuing and will continue to the Moon, Mars and beyond !"
