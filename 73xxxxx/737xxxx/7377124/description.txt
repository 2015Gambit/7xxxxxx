Discovery Channel - Weed Wars - first 4 episodes

Weed Wars is a television show that documents the world's largest medical marijuana dispensary, Harborside Health Center, in Oakland, California. It premiered on the Discovery Channel on December 1, 2011.[1] The series is mainly focused on the employees of the dispensary and the day-to-day aspects of running the business.[2][3] It also chronicles the various customers to the store, as well as both large-scale growers and smaller, patient cannabis growers who are allowed to grow a limited number of plants.[1]

In regards to their intentions by allowing their business to be documented for television, Executive Director Steve DeAngelo has said, "We wanted to be a model to other dispensaries, most of [which] have a media phobia. We wanted to tell our story and we gave Discovery complete access so that people could make up their own minds... There are a lot of stereotypes about who comes to these dispensaries, but viewers will see our customers cover a huge cross-section of the population ΓÇô age, race and economic classes. They will also see how Harborside treats cannabis as a medicine, and we have a high standard of medical care
