The sound that defines Icarus Complex would be best described as if Slayer, Lamb Of God, Protest The Hero and Born Of Osiris each had children together, each of those kids then went and had a child together. This child would be called Icarus Complex. The band evolved to performing more technical, aggressive, progressive and groove based metal. Determined to consistently raise the bar, the band have become the embodiment of the Icarus Complex.

Icarus Complex have supported and shared the stage with many great bands, including 50 Lions, Lynchmada, Down Royale, Subnuronik and more.Icarus Complex are a Brisbane based Progressive Heavy Metal band.
