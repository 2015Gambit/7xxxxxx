"Gregory Spears is a composer of refined and ΓÇ£astonishingly beautifulΓÇ¥ (New York Times) instrumental and vocal works. His recording debut is marked by Requiem, an otherworldly album-length composition scored for six voices, baroque viola, harp, troubadour harp, recorders, and electric organ, containing vastly eclectic influences. While the pieceΓÇÖs title and instrumentation suggest a characteristically baroque structure, these indices are juxtaposed with Feldmanesque harmony, Reichian repetition, and motet-like vocal stylings, liberating the piece from a particular musical era. The music is wedded to an array of time- and place-exclusive languages, including Latin, Middle French, and Breton, allowing for further multi-referentiality and conceptual intricacy.

The piece premiered in in June 2010 as an opera an opera/dance collaboration with choreographer for Christopher Williams for his dance production HenΓÇÖs Teeth. The performance enhanced the collage-esque sonic references with the disparate imagery of 19th century Breton fairy tales, Greek mythology, and middle age relics. The interdisciplinary realization was called ΓÇ£splendidΓÇªΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£the jangling together of singing voices, violin, harp, recorder, chimes, and electric organ is magical, like feathers stroking the back of your neckΓÇ¥ (Village Voice). The New York Times called SpearsΓÇÖ score ΓÇ£the most distinguished component of the evening,ΓÇ¥ the instrumentation evoking a ΓÇ£shimmering medieval aura,ΓÇ¥ and New Yorker critic Alex Ross described it as ΓÇ£cooly entrancing.ΓÇ¥

The album will be released November 15th, followed by a performance at Galapagos Art Space on November 21st, alongside a piece by composer John Supko performed by the dynamic duo Due East."
