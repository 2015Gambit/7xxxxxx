In this fast-paced romp from 1990, Jon Dough stars as a salesman who has gotten extremely bored with his work. He canΓÇÖt bear to spend his hours in the office, and now his boss (Joey Silvera) is riding him to come up with a new report. Luckily heΓÇÖs got a shapely young secretary whoΓÇÖs more than willing to write the report for him ΓÇö in exchange for some steamy office probing, that is. Meanwhile, the boss is off with his own wife engaging in some freaky frolicking of his own. The action then shifts back to Dough, whoΓÇÖs invited his girlfriend Ashley Nicole over. As you might expect, their meeting is short on dialogue and long on lust. Right about here, Jon spots a TV commercial starring luscious model Sunny McKay. He determines that heΓÇÖs just got to meet her. Of course, sheΓÇÖs spending some quality time in the clinch with her sexy assistant Alicyn Sterling, engaging in a sensual Sapphic session. Eventually, Jon meets Sunny and they enjoy a torrid tete-a-tete as well. Something about all the wild sex has by then made Jon a bit more happy with his job, so he returns to work refreshed and ready to go. Enough amorous action can make any job seem better! Sure, itΓÇÖs silly, but the white-hot action never lets up and the cast is full of lovely all natural nuggets.
