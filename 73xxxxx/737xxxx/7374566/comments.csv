[T],3R01,2012-06-22T13:02Z,EZ why you don't upload this torrent again to your profile ?
[V],extremezone,2012-06-22T13:38Z,"3R01 because after i uploaded on other torrent sites someone-DibyaTPB i think stole it and uploaded as dump...can't upload it again because it's already in database and tpb mods don't seem to accept my request to remove it to post it under my profile with right name and description,category at least if they will do my no.2 comment i will appreciate"

,psychoacer,2012-06-22T20:39Z,"When did this become some kind of private dump site that has ""rules""? I have seen like a million releases of every app or game posted on this site. The fact that the mods don't care about such crap should show you that you are in the wrong place if you think there is some sense of structure like private sites."

who gives a damn about who uploaded what since the whole purpose of P2P is to share files and as long as it goes up the issue have been resolved.

If you need credit for your work.. than maybe this is not the businesses you first was intended to believe in but still i have to agree with you if someone steals your torrent,
release or something that you have made than yes you are right and the guilty should be prosecuted like on of them french girls!

,Dirk4three,2012-06-23T15:52Z,"Guys gimme a hand...
I always mess up installing the crack for ubisoft games.
The itens on the orbit folder go to the ubisoft launcher folder and the other dll's to the game dir right?"
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-23T16:05Z,"Extremezone, just leave the issue now. If some moderator wants to go on a power trip let them. We all know who the best uploader on tpb is. Yes you. Games and movies ruled by you and only you. That green skull better come back today though, you deserve to be treated much better!!! Cannot believe they will review your status in 2 weeks only.  In 2 weeks you upload more games and movies than some VIP users have in their entire life on tpb. Cannot believe how petty they are. Anyway hope you stay here uploading torrents and dont move elsewhere, that would hurt the users way to much. Keep up the hard work.

,cyborg34573,2012-06-24T02:21Z,"@Cesz_ 

This IS extremezone's upload, havent you been reading his comments?. Someone stole his release and uploaded them on here as dump, now he cannot upload his copy because its the exact same one. So unless they delete this then he cannot upload his torrent.

But this copy uploaded by anonymous is the extremezone release, just stolen.
Hope that clears it out.

And this copy works perfectly fine."
,cyborg34573,2012-06-24T02:24Z,"@sauravgr8

You're an idiot. Extremezone uploaded the torrents first in three different sites, but that DibyaTPB guy took that and uploaded it on here as dump and his own. Now extremezone cannot fucking upload his copy because its the same exact one as DibyaTPB and its already on the site. So basically Extremezone got screwed so fuck DibyaTPB. "
,cyborg34573,2012-06-24T02:25Z,"@Bl3NDER

Follow these instructions EXACTLY and it should work

""1. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
2. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
3. Click Log in.
4. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!"""
,Punishmenthurts,2012-06-24T04:05Z,The game is working good but There´s black bars in my screen...I play on 1920*1080. But i tried others resolution but nothing...Anyone have the fix for this? 
,cyborg34573,2012-06-24T04:26Z,"@Punishmenthurts

Its probably your scaling options, check Nvidia Control Panel or CCC and fix your scaling options.

Set it to Aspect Ratio or Fullscreen and make it ""Override the scaling mode set by games and programs"". 
See if that forces it to go fullscreen and not have black bars

I see alot of people having this issue but i do not think it has anything to do with the game because i have tried 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, both 16:9 aspect ratio resolutions and i do not get black bars at all."

,Punishmenthurts,2012-06-24T11:38Z,"@cyborg34573 

I tried that but nothing, but i connected an dvi cable in my monitor (but i never changed to dvi in the options) and i started the game and that worked :o then i remove the dvi and its working normal with HDMI xd Thanks anyway friend :D  "

,Zipgun,2012-06-24T16:55Z,Heck works fine for me Win 7 64 bit. But my problem is on the precious cargo mission there seems to be a bug. When ya hit the key for the quicktime event. You just get the player killed screen. Anyone else got this bug? Tried the mission about a dozen times and always does the same shit. I'll reinstall the game and try again but if it does not work its gotta be the crack and besides this game freaking sucks it baby sits you through the whole game. Your barely involved at all its like its playing itself. Man glad I cancelled my per-order then again I had the feeling it was going to suck.

,xpmule,2012-06-29T09:48Z,"Scene groups made the god damn release.
NOT extremezone !
You wanna kiss someones ass ?
Then kiss Skidrow's because this release belongs to that group not this p2p uploader.
Lets not forget a lot of scene groups DON'T even want there releases spread across P2P networks.

This whole ""he stole my dump"" crap or whatever is utterly childish and stupid..

Explain to me why extremezone can lay claim to Skidrows PC Game releases exclusivly.
And then explain to me why there is a rule at this web site that says you can't upload a torrent because extremezone might do it.

god people are idiots.

@ Dyna-C4-mite
You should be fair and honest and explain both sides of the story. I read the forum topic where extremezone was ""making demands"" and i don't blame the mods for doing what they did. This is a web site that does not belong to extremezone and if admins want to do something they can, and f extremezone or who ever does not like it ? they can go and upload their torrents else where."
