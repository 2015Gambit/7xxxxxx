This audio was very low sounding, so I had to increase the volume.

From original uploader:

I wanted this to fit on one 700 MB CDR, so I faded out after the set closer of Slave to the Grind and faded in for the set encore opener of Disease. 
No music was deleted. The band took about a 5 minute break and the audience just chanted "one more song" over and over.
