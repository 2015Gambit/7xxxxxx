Fetish Dolls Die Laughing (2012) 
100 min - Horror 
IMDB Rating 1.1 

Do you remember, as a child, when your parents teased you with the "Tickle Monster"? It turns out that he's more real (and even more malevolent) than you could have ever imagined! With seedy photographer Billy Tagg (Michael McGovern) serving as the ancient entity's latest vessel, the Tickle Monster torments his way through a catalog of Billy's beautiful bondage babes - until no-nonsense homicide detective Greer English (Laura Romeo) catches wind of it. Now, the button-down detective must go undercover in a world where bizarre and macabre fantasies play out via the internet for the whole world to see. Can Greer stop the Tickle Monster's reign of terror or will she become the latest fetish doll to die laughing?
