It is a neat British thriller - very Hitchcockian, but without Alfred's brilliant character touches. Douglass Montgomery in his last film role does quite well as the put upon husband, trapped in a marriage and in love with another woman. His plot to kill his wife goes terribly awry. 

Patricia Burke as the trollop of a wife also does quite well. 

Film is AKA "Forbidden".
