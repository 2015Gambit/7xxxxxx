,Cerebral222,2012-06-23T03:25Z,"Thanks Mr.Stifmeister, game works well, should keep me out of trouble for a while, +1 rep from me, cheers.

NOTE: If your using any other gamepad than Xbox360, you might have alot of trouble with this game. If the game detects a contoller, it automaticlly thinks it's an Xbox360 controller; I'm using a generic PS3 gamepad with Xpadder. To trick the game into going into mouse and keyboard mode, just plug in your controller, load the xpadder profile then unplug your contoller and start the game, when in the game, plug in your contoller back in and off you go; the games not bad by the way."
,sage1210,2012-06-23T06:46Z,"two things that you must know befoer play this game. 
1. make sure you install Ubisoft Launcher with this game or this game will never run.
and do not use skidrow fix if you already can run this game, except you want to do new installation again.  
2. plug off all gamepad, joystick or whatever alike. cause it will mess up game control and trust me. this can best play by mouse and key board cause it easy for you to do many challenges that will unlocked new guns for you.

finally i run this game on win7 64bit without problem and now i make decision to buy the legal copy in order to play multiplayers mode.  "

,widek,2012-06-23T14:07Z,"@SD_rocks
thx man it works perfectly.
also thx Mr.Stifmeister for great release"
,beermotoraxe,2012-06-23T14:12Z,"FYI: it seems all blackbox releases are English only. This release is less than HALF in size compared to the Skidrow release, which contains all the other languages and voiceovers. Audio can take such a nasty amount of space. Also, I think I read the cutscenes were re-encoded in this release, to make them smaller. From 1080p to 720p. I, for one, am not too concerned that the video quality is much worse. Perfectly justifiable re-encode, in order to cram this game into smaller size.

Size does matter :)

I want to see more of these English only releases. I have to ask, do the French or the Italians or the Spanish use their first language in games, or do you switch to English whenever possible?"
,ET1996,2012-06-23T15:23Z,"Does anyone know why, when I set the game resolution to 1920x1080 (which is my desktop resolution), it doesn't fill up my whole screen?
I have at least 1 full inch of black border."

But my problem is on the precious cargo mission there seems to be a bug. When ya hit the key for the quicktime event. You just get the player killed screen. Anyone else got this bug? Tried the mission about a dozen times and always does the same shit.

 I'll reinstall the game and try again but if it does not work its gotta be the crack and besides this game freaking sucks it baby sits you through the whole game. Your barely involved at all its like its playing itself. Man glad I cancelled my per-order then again I had the feeling it was going to suck."

,mrmouth,2012-06-25T15:21Z,"Just a shitty Ubisoft release. People who paid are having the same problems. 

The ""Device is removed: device due to badly hung Formed commands"" was a problem that first cropped up with BF3. The fix was to either underclock or overclock your GPU. 

 I experience that with both the Skidrow and BB repack. Actually the BB repack also just freezes on me, too."
,mrmouth,2012-06-26T00:30Z,"I can confirm that the ""Device is removed: device due to badly hung Formed commands"" does have to do with an overclocked GPU. Mine is a factory overclocked GTX570 and I upped my voltage and now the game works. Lowering my voltage caused the game to crash immediately.

So that particular error has to do with overclocking and voltage, and can be solved easily. Use MSI afterburner and add just a small amount of voltage. "
,crazelunatic,2012-06-26T05:25Z,my crashing seems to have stopped once i increased the voltage but now i have another problem where my fps will drop to around 5-10 for about a minute or two then it will jack back up to normal. If its doing that and i hit the tab button on my keyboard the fps will jack back up immediatley...... why on earth is it doing this and why is tab or escape seem to fix this problem? (i use a controller so i dont want to be bothered pressing tab or esc on my keyboard everytime i want to get a steady framerate in game)

,LuvEvol,2012-08-04T17:05Z,"Troll? I mounted it, ran setup, and now I click on the shortcut, only to have it show a loading circle for a few seconds; nothing happens. I mean, it's not like I have a shoddy comp like all these people complaining. It doesn't say error or anything, it just does... nothing. Wonder what's up."
,Qxx1,2012-08-10T08:56Z,"thnaks blackbox for yet another awesome game.
i have nearly completed game on my xps wich has 2nd gen i5, 6gb ram n nvidia gt540m 2gb...game used to hang my rig many time and manual shutdown was the only way to get out of it..game has some problem i guess(the card can handel this easily, this game takes only 600-700mb max and i have played max payne 3 which takes 1019mb on max but then laggs a lot 20fps)

anyways now im stuck on the last mission probebly the last checkpoint where the team climbs the wall and make a run for the final two targets..there the game lags so much i dont know wats the problem no matter at what setting i play it lags so much that i cant shoot targets cant even walk in right direction...have tried disabling everything-lowest possible setting even in windowed mode but it lags the same..dont know wats wrong there. Played the rest of the game on med-high setting.

Also is there any way to get the rooftops unlocked in the guerilla mode???(anything to buypass the uplay asking for key or some other trick???)"
,mandruf,2012-08-17T01:21Z,"This release doesn't work properly.

YOU CANNOT PATCH THE GAME WITH UPDATES IF YOU USE THIS RELEASE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.

The game is full of bugs and extremely slow if you don't patch it up to 1.04. I run everything on Very high with no problem at all, but somehow this game had some kind of lag and latency problem. Ubisoft release yet another screwed up port from consoles not adapted to PC.

Get the Skidrow release and patch it up. This one sucks. "
,5HARD,2012-08-17T15:47Z,"Hey,thanks Mr.Stifmeister(I get it)for this torrent,but when it says to login as SKIDROW and put any password it just says login failed?"
,TheEthang,2012-08-20T20:56Z,"@5HARD go to settings in the bottom right and check the box that says ""Start the launcher in offline mode"". Click apply and try logging in again :)"
,Quasi93,2012-08-25T13:00Z,"Hey guys! I have found the solution how to fix your problems and errors with Ghost Recon Future Soldier. 
1. Copy the crack into game folder.
2. (When u try to run the game, most of the people are getting error.) All u should is right click on game shortcut and run as administrator.
3. As u run it as administrator, the ubisoft log in tab will pop up. First of all click on settings, and tick the box ""start the launcher in offline mode and click apply.
4. Then type in anything in some random crap in username and password, tick remember me box below and click log in
5.Then the error will come up ""Cannot play in offline mode blah blah blah, just click ""PLAY!"" and the game will start.
Tell me if it works for u 
Enjoy!!!"
,stalker277,2012-08-27T04:18Z,"Bypass this Blackbox release because it's poorly ripped.

Updates 1.2 and 1.3 install in C:Windows, that's because the update installers look for a valid install, which the blackbox never offers.

Update 1.4 crashes because ripped files are altered and thus they cannot be patched.

So if you have issues that are fixed in the updates, go get the full 12,8GB release and all will be installed properly.

Apply the 1.4 skidrow fix only update and all is well.

Also go to ehow com and search for removing pnkbstra when using the full release."
,5HARD,2012-08-28T23:48Z,"@TheEthang,thanks,but I already got it,been playing a while now,it's pretty cool."
