REVIEWS

"When it came time to select the best Mac apps of the year, we started with the list of the roughly 250 Mac programs we reviewed over the past 12 months. After much discussion, we whittled that list down to just 13 that we deemed worthy of our Editors' Choice Award" Macworld Editor's Choice Award 

"Braid's artistic design is as imaginative as its puzzles. The whimsical world looks like a painting come to life." IGN

"One of the most interesting, satisfying, beautiful game experiences I've ever had." Destructoid

"Beyond Braid's enchanting hand-painted visual style, beyond its often haunting score, and beyond its musings on love and personal growth... Braid is one of the most progressive platform/puzzle games we've played in years." IGN Australia
