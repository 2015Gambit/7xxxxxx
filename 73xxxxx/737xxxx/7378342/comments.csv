,caprikornius,2012-06-24T00:46Z,"I´m sorry. I offer my apologies. My downloads aften starts a couple of minutes once I click on download. But this time it wasn´t that way. So i got impatient. Again, I´m sorry if someone get offended. I take it back. sorry.
Now downloading spain vs france pretty fast. thanks arsenal_rocks. well, you do rock!!!!!!!!!!! "
,furiouswindbottom,2012-06-24T13:03Z,"Feel cheeky asking but for the remaining few games can you upload as one single file so we don't see first half/second half files. This spoils it a little as we can see that there was no extra time etc.

Would be brilliant if you uploaded the full BBC/ITV shows as one single file including half time. Due to the time zone I'm in I don't get to see the games until the next day as the games are on in the middle of the night.

Nice uploads btw. Yours work on my stand alone media player so I can watch on my TV which is far better than watching on the PC. 

Thanks"
