,SSJASON,2012-06-25T00:13Z,I'm sure there will be. I emailed that bug to them from my play account.
,NarutoNamikaze,2012-07-01T10:28Z,"I installed it and downloaded language from the net. But thing is, it shows Swiftkey 3 Free in my installed apps section in Google Play. But in Input selection section, it shows only Swiftkey 3. Swiftkey X showed the trial there too...
So my question is is this the free version or not?? Can we still use it after the 30 days trial is over?"
,NarutoNamikaze,2012-07-01T10:30Z,^ PS: I didn't update it.. Can we update it?
