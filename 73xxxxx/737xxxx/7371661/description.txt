First of all, if your not an otaku of Japanese culture or anime ;) then you should know that black is the color of innocence and white is the color of evil. So the term used pure black mean pure innocence or pure white or snow (in American culture anyway). So I suppose you want a review or something. Fine I'll write one :P

A girl from a high name in japan keeps constantly telling people of because of child hood experiences, but thats all just an act and she hurting inside. So she decides to go live by herself and try to get over her problem, alone. BUT, that wont happen she runs into a man from the secret service or there own special secret who claims to know her and is the most loyal person you've ever seen. But this people are not exactly who the seem and they face bigger problems then robbers with guns. ;)
