There's something wrong with this file. I downloaded it twice and all it would do is bounce in the Dock until I force quit it.

I downloaded it from the App Store and it works fine (it's FREE!)."

Not saying anything against the uploader here, but a.) why the fuck would you up anything that's free anyway and b.) god know what could have been done with the code."
