DESCRIPTION:

Social problems affect everyone. Because so many actual and potential problems confront us, it is often difficult to decide which ones affect us most severely.
Is it the threat of death or injury during a terrorist attack? Is it the threat caused by industrial pollution that may poison us or destroy our physical environment? 
Or does quiet but viciously damaging gender, age, class, racial, or ethnic discrimination have the most far-reaching effect? Do the problems of cities affect us if we live in the suburbs? 
Do poorer nationsΓÇÖ problems with overpopulation affect our quality of life?

The Encyclopedia of Social Problems offers an interdisciplinary perspective into many social issues that are a continuing concern in our lives, whether we confront them on a personal, local, regional, national, or global level. 
With more than 600 entries, these two volumes cover all of the major theories, approaches, and contemporary issues in social problems and also provide insight into how social conditions get defined as social problems, 
and the ways different people and organizations view and try to solve them.
