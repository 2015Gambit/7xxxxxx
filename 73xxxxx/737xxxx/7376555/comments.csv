,rbrucea777,2012-07-09T19:59Z,anybody know where i can get Milla Jovovich's commentary??
,regie430,2012-07-16T02:32Z,"It's 1920x800, not really 1080p. My HD player reports the facts before playing the movie. But hey! Great one and thank you! Please keep them coming!"
,saffronsghost,2012-09-18T14:48Z,"The ""fact"" is you're clueless, regie.  Blurays and DVDs include black letterbox bars in the resolution.  No sense encoding black bars with zero actual data in them and using up my HDD space and bandwidth, so they're taken out.  The actual film resolution is NOT changed, which means this is 1080p.  The more you know!"
