,luiyihn,2012-06-21T15:50Z,40 days trial copy. It's better to use winzip 16.5
,Dr.IfOff,2012-06-21T18:21Z,"sure it is the 40days trail copy but you then when you replace the winrar.exe it becomes registered
winzip 16.5 is another application this is winRAR ^.^"
,hppiefrk,2012-06-24T04:05Z,"All I did was left click and ""open"", then left click and ""repair archive"" and made sure that the box titled ""treat as zip"" was checked, and that's all I had to do!  My archives went from ""Buy now"" to them all being in there!  Thank you, Dr. IfOff!"
