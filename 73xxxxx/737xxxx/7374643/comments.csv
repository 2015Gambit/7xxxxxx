,Zipgun,2012-06-24T17:01Z,"1st off I didnt download it here I never use PUBLIC trackers. Too damn slow. But anyway game works fine for me Win 7 64 bit. But my problem is on the precious cargo mission there seems to be a bug. When ya hit the key for the quicktime event. You just get the player killed screen. Anyone else got this bug? Tried the mission about a dozen times and always does the same shit.

 I'll reinstall the game and try again but if it does not work its gotta be the crack and besides this game freaking sucks it baby sits you through the whole game. Your barely involved at all its like its playing itself. Man glad I cancelled my per-order then again I had the feeling it was going to suck."
,mscwdoc,2012-06-24T20:25Z,"""update drivers"" - that's BS. what drivers? I'll wait till someone reputable like extremezone will post it, so far no one reported successful install from your upload."
