Marijuana Nation with Lisa Ling
National Geographic goes inside the cannabis industry with Lisa Ling, reporting from secret farms and not-so-secret grow houses of marijuana cultivators - into a world where marijuana is not just a drug but a way of life. Learn what's behind the increased potency of a new designer crop and how growers circumvent law enforcement while creating a more perfect plant - sometimes literally in their living rooms. Then explore the controversial medical uses of marijuana in some states, permitting personal use in violation of federal law and creating a tangled web of enforcement conflicts. Ling conducts revealing interviews with the self-proclaimed "Prince of Pot," law enforcement, growers, scientists and everyday users who offer insight into this complex set of issues.
