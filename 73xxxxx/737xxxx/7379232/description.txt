Bristol welcomes viewers into the Palin household as she prepares to say goodbye to her hometown, Wasilla, Alaska, for a few months. But first, she has to convince her reluctant younger sister, Willow, to come with her and her son, Tripp, to Los Angeles. Once in LA, Bristol adjusts to life in a big city and comes face to face with a very angry critic of the Palin family and her response makes headlines. Bristol and "Dancing with the Stars'" Mark Ballas reunite while Willow gets homesick and leaves Bristol and Tripp alone in LA.
