Hai everione hope ya doin' a-ok :)

These are rescued files from this seedless torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6668564/Aeon_Flux_Complete_Uncompressed
(It was when I tried to download it not so long ago)

The main reason it's because the only seeder it had, used MediaGet2
and it's NOT the best torrent client trust me, I've had to use it
otherwise I won't get it done nor in 2020. (+_+')

- Files named according to air dates FIXED
- *.xml corrected and removed FIXED
- All pictures moved to correct folder FIXED

This was the first thing done as Aeon Flux is concerned,
and it started as a short animated series on LiquidTV (MTV Program)

If you watched the Aeon Flux 2005 Movie you don't want to miss this!
It all started with this series.

So, it contains all 3 series made, special features
and a plus of pictures.


Have Fun! :D
