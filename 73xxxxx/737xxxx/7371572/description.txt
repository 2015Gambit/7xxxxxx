Having awoken from their spring break extravaganza at Lake Victoria, the swarm heads

it comes to fun, nobody does it wetter! Though they came to get wet, get loaded and get 

some, the staff and patrons get more than they bargained for when they must face the 

fiercest, most bloodthirsty piranhas yet. Lead by the strong-willed, studious Maddy and
