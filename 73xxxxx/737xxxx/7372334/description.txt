 Chaurahen - Crossroads is an evocative     
 and poignant composition consisting of     
 three separate stories set in three        
 different cities in contemporary India.    
 Each revolves around love, life, and loss. 
 The first story enters straight into the   
 heart of Farooq and Ira's relationship     
 in Mumbai. Farooq remains troubled by his  
 own inability to let go of the memories    
 of his dead parents in his ancestral which 
 he continues to occupy and use as the      
 disturbing muse for his own writing. So    
 deeply ensconced in being haunted by his   
 own past, Farooq appears incapable of      
 fully living in the present, to the extent 
 to which he proves powerless in responding 
 to the possibility of sharing true love
