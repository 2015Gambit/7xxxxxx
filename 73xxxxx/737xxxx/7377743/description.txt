Chuck has been building his own car for a while, but is still missing a part. When Mike gets it from the Duke of Detroit's 'territory,' the two propose a wager - Chuck vs. the Duke's best drivers with Mutt as the grand prize. To make things more complicated, Chuck reveals to Mike he doesn't know how to drive; to help his friend, Mike decides to give Chuck a 'crash course' in driving.
