,tty5,2012-06-23T08:46Z,This is lossy or lossless REPACK (video & audio) !???
,acidvenom,2012-06-23T13:13Z,does this include video and audio??
,soulking77,2012-06-23T16:57Z,Yes It Is Complete Version And Full Game From (SKIDROW). Nothing Removed Just Deleted Some Other Languages Except English.
,unicum99,2012-06-23T19:47Z,"Does anyone know why, when I set the game resolution to 1920x1080 (which is my desktop resolution), it doesn't fill up my whole screen?
I have at least 1 full inch of black border. "
,rbs49,2012-06-23T19:51Z,"soulking77 really other languages occupied 7.88 gb space?
Is it real or some contents like sounds and other stuff removed?
Please do reply in little detail. I started to d/l this one."
,chrede2750,2012-06-23T20:28Z," i have installed it now.
& the installer is in Russian! 
After that. i blokked my firewall and go play offline ! but all in the game is in Russian! 

u say its is in English? or do i mistake? "
,PoppaChubbie,2012-06-23T22:33Z,"This is complete bullshit!! The dl is a file with no extension so renamed and put .iso on the end. Installer is all in crap (presumably Russian) but no problem getting thru it. When u attempt to start the game it says ""LOG IN FAILED! Please check your username and password and try again"", and that's as far as u can go. If u try to start the launcher u get an error. I blocked access with firewall but no difference. I tried every available option and 3 separate installs but nothing worked. Better to dl from some1 who knows what they're doing cos this is a total waste of time and 5 gig dl. Uploader, you're full of shit!"
,chrede2750,2012-06-23T23:15Z,"The game works fine PoppaChubbie ! 
the only thing with this one . the installer is in russian + the mainÂ´menu is in russian ! , some of the subs are in russian , but the talk from soldiers and some substitles is  in english! , but i cant russian . so its was not easy to start the game in mainmenu :D but it works fine .. just month the iso file in daemon tools lite or what else u use ;) , then install and play from install folder , and blok firewall and go play OFFLINE! "
,PoppaChubbie,2012-06-24T06:55Z,"I dl'ed the Skidrow one, works perfectly; decent instructions too. Maybe this didn't work for me cos I'm not in USA or Europe. Better off without this one anyway cos I don't want any Rusky, only English. Anyway, next time I'll stick with Skiddy or Blackbox from the start.
Wonder what they removed from this besides languages cos I can't believe the languages were 8.8 gig."
,PoppaChubbie,2012-06-24T08:52Z,"Whoops, I mean 7.8 gig."
,biggles2012,2012-06-24T18:54Z,"video MUST have been recoded, even with recoded video the smallest release after this is 5.55GB, i wouldn't trust it, first torrent this guy has released"
,biggles2012,2012-06-24T18:55Z,and he specifically tells you to disable your antivirus... thats not a good idea when you have no reason to trust this uploader
,Bagofun,2012-06-25T09:00Z,"Come on, game works perfectly but its all in Russian. Can't play a game that isn't in English - where's the fix??? "
,Bagofun,2012-06-25T13:34Z,"Scratch that, either 2nd or 3rd misson (one in Africa) game goes to a blank screen after reaching checkpoint "
