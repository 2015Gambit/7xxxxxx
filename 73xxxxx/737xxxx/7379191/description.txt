Special Thanks for GOOGLE INC., largest piracy provider in the world. Without you I'd never put all of these clips into one place! It's f***** ironic that one of the companies standing most against the piracy at the same time distributes billions of hours of illegal music, videos and books every month!
Google - your daily dose of piracy.
