Candlemass-Psalms For The Dead-2012-MTD

Psalms for the Dead is the Swedish doom metal legend's swansong. Contrary to the 
rampant rumors, the band will not be splitting up, but ratherconcentrating on 
live performances. Candlemass' final studio album shows a band at the top of their 
game and it will soon earn the cult status it well deserves. The release is filled 
with such highlights as "Dancing in the Temple of the Mad Queen Bee" or the sweeping 
opening track "Prophet," which beautifully showcases the band's strengths.
