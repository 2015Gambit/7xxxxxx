,7117,2012-06-22T02:07Z,":D user review from imdb:
'' If a group of 11 year old children decided to make a film, had a camera, wrote a script, then got some money for some special effects (around say $23), then this would be the result. 

This is the worst film I have ever seen. It may in fact be the worst film that has ever been made in all of human history.''"

7117 right on this one needs a quick trip to the bit bucket. "

action/drama/war

The German U-Boat, U-234, from the Port of Kiel is trading cargo with the Japanese. USS Seaviper must locate and stop this dangerous exchange. The Captain of USS Seaviper must go ashore to conduct reconnaissance on an island near Sumatra, but the ship is left in the hands of Mister Cutter, after the Executive Officer is injured in battle. A conflict between Cutter and the Chief of the Boat puts the submarine in jeopardy. Seaviper is trapped below the surface, with decreasing oxygen, and a Japanese destroyer hunting them from above. Damage to the boat also leave her survival in question. They must fight the Japanese destroyer and get the information about U-235 back to Pearl Harbor. 


this theme has been done way too too many time before i rather watch a crappy sci fi with overbudget CGI than this crap"
