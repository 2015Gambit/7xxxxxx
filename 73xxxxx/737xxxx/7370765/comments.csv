But I guess it's easier to make a dirty propaganda show for the already brainwashed lemmings of the western world how ""racist"" WE are, when WE let millions of 3rd worlders into OUR countries, give them free health care, free education, freedom of speech, religion and movement. We give them a future in OUR societies, a thousand times more than we could ever expect back from their countries. Hell, we even send BILLIONS of Dollars/Euros to the 3rd world to help them there too! What more can we do?!?!

And WE'RE the racists?

Antiracism is just a codeword for anti-white."

But if Amir and the others weren't there in the first place, there wouldn't be any situation to ""diffuse""....

And that's the whole point. Our world is full of war and ethnic tension...why import these cultures to our western part of the world, where they just continue and drag us down with them? 

Just saying....they seem capable of taking care of themselves, don't look very much like refugees...so why not go back home and build up their own countries, instead of living among white people who will never accept them. And, more importantly, THEY never accept themselves!"
