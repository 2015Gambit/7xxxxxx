at the rate of seeding of less than 5kbps this will take a month to finish.

thank you"
,quackgrass,2012-06-29T23:33Z,I found this programme to be quite good.  Well done and very interesting.  Wish it were in HD though.
,movieboy_5280,2012-07-07T07:16Z,"Darn, I found this at another source because the search engine here sucks.

However they are identical and the quality is excellent: V=8 A=10 (IMHO)

To show my loyalty and thanks for posting anyway, I will modify the name of the folder to match yours and seed this torrent too keep it running strong forever!

Vive Le Canada!"
,movieboy_5280,2012-07-10T02:47Z,"I was right!  The files were identical with the exception being that the other had a different name, a self-promotional text file and a folder with 4 snapshots - an easy fix.

I made the adjustments mentioned above and now seeding yours and will continue to do so as long as I have a computer.

My Dad, another history buff, will love this as a belated Father's day add-on and so will my household.

Thanks again!!!"
