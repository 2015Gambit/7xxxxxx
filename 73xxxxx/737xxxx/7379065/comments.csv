i downloaded a bunch of ur previous releases...NONE where bluray rips like you claimed...common buddy...rip em with good quality...no more grainy pixelation crap

and rip em with a PROPER 1920x1080 rez...and NONE of those black lines at the top and bottom...i dont wanna see noobs crying about the aspect ratio...

thanks"
