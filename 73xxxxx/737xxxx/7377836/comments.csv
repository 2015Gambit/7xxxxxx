,Varjagi,2012-06-23T03:23Z,Thanx mdusanjay. Love what you do here. Do you know anything about Crossed-Badlands no. 7 and 8? 
,contatnt1one,2012-06-23T04:10Z,"Hey mdusanjay. Thanks for all your great work.  I just was wondering if you could post Warlord of Mars 13 or the current set thats out. I've been waiting to read past 12 until I could find it. I think you said somewhere that it was supposed to end on 18 or something like that. I hope they find a reason to extend it somehow. I really love this series. Stunning graphics and classic sci-fi story. I've never read the novels, so I dont know how it ends."
