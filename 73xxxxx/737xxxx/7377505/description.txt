Tuesday 06/19:

Sharon Osbourne
She's a judge on "America's Got Talent" and a co-host on "The Talk," but whenever we see Sharon Osbourne, we can just hear Ozzy bellowing "Shaaaaaaaaronnnnnnnn!"

Ashley Fiolek
Not only is the amazing Ashley Fiolek the 2011 Women's Motocross Champion but she's also been deaf since birth. Suddenly our ability to burp the alphabet looks even smaller in comparison.

Chad Daniels
The hilarious Chad Daniels has a funny bit about Jesus and the 12 Apostrophes. It would make the strict grammarian nuns who taught us laugh until their wimples crumpled.
