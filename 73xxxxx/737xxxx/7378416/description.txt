Gary Hampton had the perfect life: a beautiful wife, a loving daughter, and a job that afforded them anything. But that all changes when hes bitten by a werewolf. Pushed nearly to the brink of death, Gary finds himself thrust into a brave new world populated by super heroes, vampires, werewolves, and a whole host of supernatural spooks. But why was he bit? How will he tell his family, and will they accept him and what hes become? As Gary searches for the answers to his new lupine existence he attempts to hone his lyncanthropic abilities for good, fighting crime and keeping his city safe as The Astounding Wolf-Man!
