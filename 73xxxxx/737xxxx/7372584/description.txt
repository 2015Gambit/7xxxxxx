The Denial of Death is a 1973 work of psychology and philosophy by Ernest Becker.[1] It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1974, two months after the author's death. The book builds on the works of SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, Sigmund Freud, and Otto Rank.

Becker's work has had a wide cultural impact beyond the fields of psychology and philosophy. The book made an appearance in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall, when the death-obsessed character Alvy Singer buys it for his girlfriend Annie. It was referred to by Spalding Gray in his work It's a Slippery Slope.[3] Bill Clinton quoted it in his autobiography; he also included it as one of 21 titles in his list of favorite books.
