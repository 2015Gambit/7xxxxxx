It is a startling fact that the UK is made up of about 6,000
different islands, and this landmark series sets out to
explore the most fascinating yet unfamiliar ones. Martin
Clunes (Doc Martin, Shakespeare In Love, Men Behaving Badly)
visits some of these beautiful but remote communities,
shedding new light on their history, culture, flora and fauna
whilst guiding us through amazing landscapes and seascapes and
meeting colourful locals along the way.

The series showcases all sorts of island dwellers from people
who live off the land, to the mega rich who use their islands
to escape the paparazzi. We also get to hear some remarkable
stories of British folklore, with tales of smugglers, pirates,
wizards and Saints.
