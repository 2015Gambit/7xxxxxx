You need to right click and ""Explore"" the drive the mounted iso is in. That's where the folder is."
,microxerox,2012-06-22T12:28Z,"Does anyone know if the booster promo code is random? Mine is NCDN***F, unless it's the same for everyone else, we can take these codes to the store and redeem them."

Dumbshit. You need to have directX installed dumbass. That's why the .dll file is missing."

,neskim,2012-06-30T20:48Z,"Works like a charm!

Does anyone know how can I play this in lan? Everytime I go to multiplayer it says there is an error with the conection, wich I assume is from being cracked. But how can I go around that to play in lan or by hamachi or some direct internet play?"
,kkrzaqq,2012-07-03T15:49Z,"kaspersky found trojan. in both versions, skidrow and theta."
,ashertaz2,2012-07-09T11:29Z,"To play with locked cards:
1. Install the game;
2. Copy from skidrow folder just the .exe (Dotp_d13) into the installation folder and replace;
3.Download and install SmartSteam (link from rapidshare worked for me)
4. Run SmartSteam and login (make an account if u have none);
5. Start the game from the desktop link.

Should work just fine, all except 3 decks are locked, 1 of the has no unlocked cards, other 2 have 30 unlocked cards. progress is saved (in unlock and campaign). The only thing that seems to not work properly are the achievements. "
,doodeyfoodle,2012-07-17T23:30Z,I really enjoyed this game so I bought it. Does anyone know how to transfer my deck/card unlocks from this version to the official Steam copy?

,locria,2012-08-18T15:37Z,Thanks for this sir. WotC has more than enough of my money already.
,madpraxis,2012-09-04T07:22Z," Another one...to the person who stated there is a trojan...Well, yes. What exactly do you think a game crack is? 
Technically, a trojan.
 Just remember, every time someone points out that a crack comes up as a trojan (which is every time) a seeder dies. And, no, clapping will not bring them back to life. But maybe the login only torrents will..."
,jb483,2012-09-17T03:56Z,Any tips on running this through Crossover Games on a Mac? I got through step 3. I interpreted step 4 as copying the Skidrow folder's contents into the folder where the Application installed into. Is that right? When I try to open the application nothing happens and after a few seconds it crashes.
