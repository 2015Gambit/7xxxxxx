,inf0x0,2012-06-23T13:42Z,"Horrible, why bother posting a torrent if you aren't going to seed it?  Watching the available parts of it, the quality is shitty to say the least.  

WAIT FOR ANOTHER RIP FROM SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T15:31Z,"it reported hell of alot more seeds last night.

it's ironic you're complaining about something that's free...

back to seeding"
,jblack110,2012-06-23T15:49Z,This isn't even labeled right.  S01E04 is dubbed sink or swim.  S01E05 which doesn't come out until June 28th is dubbed What Happens in Vegas.  So what exactly is this??
,jblack110,2012-06-23T16:20Z,terrible quality.  out of sync by about  1 sec. i am not normally a complainer but if your going to do something at least do it right.  what a waste of time and bandwidth!!

of course quality is low, it's a tvrip. If you're not familiar with release tags, then you shouldn't be downloading anything."

Well wouldn't any tv show that is less than a week old be a TV Rip?? That is no excuse for BAD quality.  Every other release group out there would be ashamed to have something like this in their name. This is the first and last torrent that i will download from you.  I will wait for AFG, MSD or LMAO.  At least they know what there doing and put out GOOD Quality releases!!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T19:00Z,"LOL.

No.

I suggest you familiarise yourself with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types

TVRips are not HD. They're from computer TV tuners. If it was HD from a TV tuner, it'd be HDTVRip.

All AFG and msD is reenc other group's 720p releases...we do the raw thing"
,jblack110,2012-06-23T19:24Z,"lmao you do the wrong thing not the ""raw"" thing"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T22:47Z,"If you check Discovery's website, the episode guide title of What Happens in Vegas matches with this episode.

I quote:

WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS 
Our four dealers gamble on the craziest collection yet including a prohibition roulette wheel, a ""T-REX of the sea"", a movie starâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s saddle, and a map that leads to murder. But it's a tiny bottle originally bought for 25 cents that drives bidding sky-high."
