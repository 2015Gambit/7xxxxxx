,NanoEntity,2012-06-23T10:02Z,"Seems to work.

Had to do Force-Recheck on the torrent 6 times, someone is seeding bad pieces.

Make sure your recheck is 100%, else the ISO will be corrupted."

,Seancpconn,2012-06-23T22:09Z,"Hey guys!

Just logged in just to help everyone out!

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed.

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.
8. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!"

,DastardlyDez,2012-06-24T01:48Z,"I have AMD Radeon 6970, and am running Win 7 32 bit, for some reason i have problems playing all Ubisoft games. When Futuresoldier.exe runs I just get black screen, when i check processes it says not responding, can someone please help me"
,Zipgun,2012-06-24T16:59Z,"1st off I didnt download it here I never use PUBLIC trackers. Too damn slow. But anyway game works fine for me Win 7 64 bit. But my problem is on the precious cargo mission there seems to be a bug. When ya hit the key for the quicktime event. You just get the player killed screen. Anyone else got this bug? Tried the mission about a dozen times and always does the same shit.

 I'll reinstall the game and try again but if it does not work its gotta be the crack and besides this game freaking sucks it baby sits you through the whole game. Your barely involved at all its like its playing itself. Man glad I cancelled my per-order then again I had the feeling it was going to suck."

,Mashmodo,2012-07-01T17:55Z,"MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE UBISOFT GAME LAUNCHER!

If you have any problems getting the game to run, make sure you have the Ubisoft Launcher installed. If you don't you can find it in the redist folder on the ISO.

Can now confirm it works."
,abracwan,2012-07-01T20:58Z,Shouldn't you be able to play the game by just blocking it with your firewall and not updating the game at all. This would be way more efficient than making the thing start offline and downloading the whole ubisoft update.

,RafVne2,2012-07-12T13:42Z,"Thank you for the up... but I gotta say this game sucked ass... I mean... There wasn't really that much playing... sometimes shit just started happening and I didn't even know what the fuck happened there. I just shot few times and I've completed a mission... WTF?...
... but... there was a good news... after I installed this it threw me to blackbox site to download spec ops the line... I was expecting it to be a third class game, but I have had so much fun playing that one... and since i'm always playing on hard it gave me some deacent chalenge... so if you enjoy actually playing a game... nothing fancy, nothing new... good storyline... I recomend that..."
