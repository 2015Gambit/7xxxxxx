@Varjagi try here I sent up the whole set I have so far, issues 1-8 of Badlands.

If you like it seed it, and buy it! My son has a growing collection of the cool variants, but his idea is support the creators by buying new and the stores by buying back issues along with the new. That way we all win!"
