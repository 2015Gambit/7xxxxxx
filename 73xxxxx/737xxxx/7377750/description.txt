Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, June 22 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Lord Monckton and Marc Morano who are covering the United Nations' Rio+20 earth summit on the globalists' version of sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Morano edits the Climate Deport website and Monckton is a British politician who has spoken out vociferously on the debunked theory of man-made climate change. 

Alex also talks with filmmaker Joel Gilbert about his Dreams from My Real Father, a documentary that posits Obama's real father is was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years. Dreams from My Real Father is now available at the Infowars Store. 

Alex also covers the fact that the EPA long ago developed drone spy planes to surveil American farmers and ranchers. A report posted onwas widely panned as bogus by the establishment media.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
