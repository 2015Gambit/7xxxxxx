This is one of the most boring movies I have seen in a very long time. There were only a couple of scenes worth watching and the rest was same old same old. The only redeeming parts were toward the beginning of the film, and they didn't really tie in to the rest of the movie. It was all downhill from there. Uninspiring camera angles, OK acting, and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. Louis did a great job, however, and I was surprised that Monica's acting is improving slightly. We all know that Monica is a beautiful lady, but focusing on this aspect of her is starting to get old. She actually did a decent job acting, so it would have been nice if the director had focused more on this than on her physical beauty. Was expecting much better work out of Philippe Garrel. Better luck next time.
