Description off Wikipedia:

"The Aquabats! Super Show! is an American action-comedy television series which premiered on March 3, 2012 on the United States cable network The Hub. The series was created by Christian Jacobs and Scott Schultz, both the creators of the Nick Jr. series Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Jason deVilliers.
A mix of live-action and animation, The Aquabats! Super Show! is based on the superhero mythology of The Aquabats, a real-life Californian rock band which series co-creator Jacobs fronts. Styled similarly to the campy aesthetic of the 1960s Batman series, each episode follows the comic adventures of The Aquabats, a musical group of amateur superheroes, as they continually defend the world from a variety of villains and monsters."
