The Living Landscape is a manifesto, resource, and textbook for architects, landscape architects, environmental planners, students, and others involved in creating human communities. Since its first edition, published in 1990, it has taught its readers how to develop new built environments while conserving natural resources. No other book presents such a comprehensive approach to planning that is rooted in ecology and design. And no other book offers a similar step-by-step method for planning with an emphasis on sustainable development. This second edition of The Living Landscape offers Frederick SteinerΓÇÖs design-oriented ecological methods to a new generation of students and professionals.

The Living Landscape offers

ΓÇó a systematic, highly practical approach to landscape planning that maximizes ecological objectives, community service, and citizen participation
ΓÇó more than 20 challenging case studies that demonstrate how problems were met and overcome, from rural America to large cities
ΓÇó scores of checklists and step-by-step guides
ΓÇó hands-on help with practical zoning, land use, and regulatory issues
ΓÇó coverage of major advances in GIS technology and global sustainability standards

As Steiner emphasizes throughout this book, all of us have a responsibility to the Earth and to our fellow residents on this planet to plan with vision. We are merely visiting this planet, he notes; we should leave good impressions.
