Massively Effective (96 Page Soft Cover Graphic Novel)-

A superhero buddy story wrapped up in a love letter to old school comics and cartoons. 

Massively Effective is the story of two best friends, who started out as arch enemies, named Mass and Effect. They were one of the greatest b-list superhero teams that ever existed. That is, until they got tired of the constant disrespect from the super boys club and decided to retire once and for all and open up a small comic book shop called Massivelly Effective. As time went by, they learned to love their new lives. But they became complacent. Effect couldn't stand it anymore. He yearned for the days when they fought alien invasions, zombie massacres and giant rock n' roll king lizards. He wanted it back and without Mass' knowledge, Effect returned to crimefighting. Mass, not wanting to let his best friend do the super hero thing without him, reluctantly jumped back into the game. 

Now they're back with more jeers than cheers, but things have changed. The game is more deadly, old enemies are out for blood and Mass and Effect might come to find out that they may actually be more important than they could ever imagine.
