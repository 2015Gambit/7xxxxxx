WinAMP (Windows Audio MPEG Player) is a program from Nullsoft that allows PC users to play audio files, particularly music, in many (but not all) popular digital audio formats, including MS-Audio, wav, and MP3. With WinAMP, it is possible to listen to SHOUTcast streaming radio broadcasts. The program allows the user to convert audio from analog tape recorders, phonographs, and other media to MP3 digital format, and it allows the user to burn MP3 files onto CDs. WinAMP can be configured to periodically scan folders on a computer hard drive for new media.
