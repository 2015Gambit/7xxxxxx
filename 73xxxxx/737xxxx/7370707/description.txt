Cajun Early Recordings [4CD, JSP, 192kb] 

A comprehensive four-disc set on the always reliable budget reissue label JSP, Cajun Early Recordings begins at the beginning, with the entirety of what's generally considered the very first Cajun recording session, an April 1928 set in New Orleans by singer and accordion player Joe Falcon, guitarist Cleoma Breaux (soon to be Falcon's wife, making them the A.P. and Sara Carter of Cajun music), and her brother, fiddler Ophy Breaux, which included the instant classic single "Lafayette." The set ends seven years and 102 tracks later with a ten-track session by a catchall group featuring Luderin Darbone, leader of the Hackberry Ramblers. 

Besides being in rough chronological order, the set is loosely divided between those two poles, with every track on the first two CDs featuring one or more members of the Falcon/Breaux extended family, various permutations of Darbone's bands filling the entire fourth CD, and the third devoted primarily to fiddler Leo Soileau, along with a few very early recordings by accordion player Lawrence Walker, who wouldn't record his best material until the '50s. 

What's most interesting about these early recordings is how percussive and rhythmic this music is even though the majority of these recordings lack any sort of percussion. As always with JSP's historical documents, the sound quality is dependent on the state of the source recordings, which is quite often rather dodgy. Still, the historical and musical import of these recordings is more than enough to compensate. (review by Stewart Mason)
