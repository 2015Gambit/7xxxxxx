London 2012 Olympics XBOX360-iMARS

London 2012: The Official Video Game of the Olympic Games brings the excitement of 
the once-in-a-generation, home country event to UK gamers. Featuring party and 
individual play, motion control for some activities and traditional games controls 
for all, the game from SEGA also has a strong soundtrack including Adele, Gorillaz, 
Justin Bieber and Buckcherry. The game has more than 40 official Olympic events 
some of which have never been seen in the context of a video game before. 
Events and activities.

Each of these is played out in authentically recreated and official Olympic arenas 
with LondonΓÇÖs skyline looming in the distance. The arenas include the new Aquatics 
Centre and the Trampoline at North Greenwich Arena as well as the main stadium in 
Stratford East London. Game modes include single player Olympic Games mode, online 
and offline multiplayer and party play. Then the action can be taken online as 
gamers compete for the highest scores on global leaderboards that track personal 
medals gained whilst playing online. Because itΓÇÖs the Olympics though, each personal 
medal won is added to that nationΓÇÖs medal table. All of this is played out with 
reactive commentary using realistic graphics and TV style presentation.
