,Dezroy,2012-06-23T07:13Z,"Thanks for the up s4a.

Can anyone confirm that this release isn't missing sections of fights like one of Sir Paul's TUF releases?"
,arathanstorrents,2012-06-23T08:27Z,thankyou
,TsarB0mba,2012-06-23T08:51Z,"SirPaul's last UFC event was complete, but his rips have been in the old 624x352 resolution. the RUDOS rip is 704x400 (as are most x264 rips these days).  If you're not worried about another ~200MB for a passably-better picture, might as well grab the RUDOS rip from s4a.

Thank you for making the SirPaul rips available, s4a, you are doing great work!"

,seshwan84,2012-06-23T22:01Z,is the audio for this not off by at least 30 minutes in the second half? The first fight is shown twice but the audio keeps going and you hear the audio for the next fight during Swanson's repeated fight.
,Ares-The-Wreckless,2012-06-24T04:27Z,PLEASE SEED! thx for upload!
