At times humorous and at times terrifying, these unusual case studies of seemingly unbelievable injuries and illnesses have one thing in common: they are all entirely true. Dr. Rob MyersΓÇÖ firsthand medical knowledge allows him to see past thin excuses to uncover the outrageously dangerous conditions that people have gotten themselves into. Pool balls and uncooked spaghetti are removed from locations where they never should have been placed, a drunken crew of neighbors tries to use a lawnmower to trim their hedges with disastrous results, and a high school football player gets into a fight with a vending machine that stole his dollarΓÇöno scenario is too strange to appear in this volume of medical maladies.
