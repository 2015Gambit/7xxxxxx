Set in the urban world of contemporary Tehran, this story of a couple pressured by family and tradition into destroying their happy union is a window into a world uneasily straddling the past and present. Happily married but childless, Leila and Reza are pressured by Reza's mother to keep the family name alive. When Reza refuses to take a second wife the mother-in-law goes to work on Leila, wearing down her resistance with a mix of pleading, haranguing and outright lies, until the couple reluctantly gives in.
