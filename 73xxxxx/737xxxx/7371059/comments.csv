[V],globeplus,2012-06-20T22:52Z,"Hi to all the gamers and Resident Evil fans and this comment it is to talk about my option for this particular game : i checked with respect 4 possible options to play this game and PSX and Nintendo Gamecube are ok to play and the gamepad works but no extra features on the game iso , then the PC that have The Mercenaries extra feature that it is a survival game that the player needs to complete missions before time runs out but the gamepad not easy to be working and finally my option : DREAMCAST version , why ? because it is clearly the most complete one , have the main game and The Mercenaries survival game and an Epilogue section that it is beeing completed while playing the game and the Gamepad it is ok too , so generally speaking the most complete version for this particular game is the Dreamcast version and i think any of you after checking all the possibilities certainly choosed this version too ... happy gaming to all of you and like i said in before files for this games series , the search for the best versions of the games for every single file it is a promise that i have the intention to keep and once more the search for the best version of the game happen ..."
