,artisto1,2012-06-21T13:18Z,Is it FAKE or REAL?
,positionerror12,2012-06-21T20:38Z,"It's real. As the info says, it is NOT the Hollywood blockbuster ""Battleship"" movie (of which there are screeners floating around), but an Asylum ""mockbuster"" movie called ""American Battleship""."
,positionerror12,2012-06-21T20:41Z,"Apparently this movie also has other names in other countries. The IMDB link says ""American Warship"", but the movie is clearly titled ""American Battleship"" in the opening credits. (shrug)."
