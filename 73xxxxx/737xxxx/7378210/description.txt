Andy Mineo, formely known as C-Lite, grew up in a single parent home in Syracuse, New York. From a young age, he struggled with profanity, submission to authority, and physical aggression, to the point of being removed from the public school system and placed in behavioral modification centers.

At a summer retreat, Andy met people who shared with him the Gospel of Jesus Christ. One night, after a chapel service, he experienced God during a prayer session that literally brought him to the floor. He left that place, knowing that he had experienced God, and recognizing that he felt the start of true and powerful change.

Eventually, Andy moved back to the inner city of Syracuse and returned to public school. But, due to the lack of spiritual discipline, exemplary believers and mentors, Andy rode the spiritual high of his summer experience into the ground. As high school came along, so did a new season of temptations and trials.

Throughout high school, he excelled in athletics, playing football, basketball, and lacrosse. He also built a lucrative recording studio in his basement and recorded and produced hundreds of artists in Upstate New York. Beyond the producer credits, he was known as a battle rapper, winning freestyle competitions and performing with a hip hop group that he founded with three of his closest friends.

Through meeting other believers who encouraged him in his walk, Andy discovered T.R.U.C.E. ministries, an opportunity that allowed him to fuse his musical abilities with his desire to serve God. Andy spent several months traveling with T.R.U.C.E. and sharing the Gospel in some of the most poverty-stricken and drug-infested neighborhoods in the U.S.

Andy is currently enrolled at the City College of New York, working toward a degree in Audio Technology. In the meantime, he has dedicated his life and talents to the advancement of the Gospel. He desires that men would look to the cross of Christ to find their only means of reconciliation towards God. He believes that the transforming power of God in Jesus will return man to his proper place in creation - to love, serve, worship, and honor God above all else (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
