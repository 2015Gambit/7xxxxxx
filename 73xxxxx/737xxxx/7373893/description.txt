HEART OF THE FACTORY 
a film by Virna Molina and Ernesto Ardito 

SYNOPSIS: 

In Argentina, the workers of Zanon Ceramic take the factory in their own hands when the owner closes it. They start to produce ceramics again, but without bosses. 

Now, they feel free. They’ve found in their work a way to grow humanly. But at the same time, they have to assume a series of responsibilities and challenges. Usually, this provokes serious arguments among them or with themselves. 

During that process, the workers had to study and to overcome themselves in order to solve all the problems linked to the areas of production. Through the democratic assembly, they found a way to support their organisation and learn how to take their own decisions in the management. 

In a country devastated by an economic debacle, they created two hundred new jobs. Now they are 470 people working in the factory. Together with 5,000 Neuquen’s inhabitants who support them, workers have resisted four attempts of evictions. 

They do not consider themselves as the new owners of the ceramic factory: on the contrary, they consider the Neuquén community as the only owner. And they give back in donations to the most needed sectors the surplus that the factory produces. 

This is a permanent challenge where every day they have to fight against a political and economic system that tries to boycott them. 

Their biggest obstacle though does not come from the outside. It is about their own fears inculcated by this society. Although many of them do not know it, if they win the battle in their consciences they will open the door to build a completely different world.
