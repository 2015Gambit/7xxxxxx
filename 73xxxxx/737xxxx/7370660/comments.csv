,biggblack86,2012-06-23T01:32Z,"yea, what gives on the no file extension??"
,wtrbr4,2012-06-25T05:46Z,"Despite the lack of extensions, the videos I checked all successfully played with VLC. Also, this set just lists all episodes in sequence, without the a/b naming convention, but all the videos seem to be there. So, perhaps a bit of a mess, but this is the best we have -- thanks uploader!"
,ArKanHellpy,2012-06-29T06:43Z,Thanx Man! I am bananas for this show!
,KoaLARP,2012-07-01T21:45Z,thank you very much.
,rleal92,2012-07-01T22:06Z,MATHEMATICAL!
,haraop,2012-07-10T23:19Z,I changed the extension to .mkv and VLC plays them perfectly
,seedAy,2012-07-16T19:10Z,"The episodes range from 30mb - 160mb...
Some of the episodes have CRAP Quality.
It's worth it for one gig. There will be a better tor in a couple months."
,topk,2012-07-17T01:18Z,What the heck?? there are files without the file extensions!?
,Mmatthew,2012-07-18T01:24Z,"Fuck ya, thanks kermode."
,brutal_product,2012-07-21T02:41Z,"Great show! Terrible upload. You should fix this or take it down. Image quality is crap, watermarked, and no file extensions. You should be ashamed of not proofing your torrent."
,666hitler,2012-07-30T08:56Z,"Runs in VLC without file extension.
CODEC: H264 MPEG-4 AVC

So use .mp4"
,trudrecko,2012-08-11T08:19Z,"I agree with brutal, this is a terrible up. extremely varying quality, first ep is completely trash... all in all.... rubbish. cmon man, you can do better than that."
,torrentqueen420,2012-08-17T11:57Z,wow i wasted my time on this! thought it was legit and its just files with no extention i would take this down if i were you
,grei_eba,2012-09-04T02:59Z,HORRIBLE QUALITY
