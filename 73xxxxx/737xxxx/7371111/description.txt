Societal Organization and Globalization in Anthropology

 

Anthropology introduces students to the four fields of anthropology. It integrates historical, biological, archaeological, and global approaches with ethnographic data available from around the world. Additionally, information is drawn from both classic and recent research in the field and reflects the current state-of-the-art understanding of social and cultural changes.

 

Using an applied perspective, Anthropology demonstrates how anthropologists use research techniques and methods to help solve practical problems, thus showing students how anthropology is relevant to improving human societies.
