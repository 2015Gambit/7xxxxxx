Casanova Avarita #4 [Marvel]

One of the most critically acclaimed series of the year comes to its catastrophic conclusion. CASANOVA: AVARITIA #4 answers every question (almost), solves every riddle (kind of), and explains absolutely everything you ever wanted to know about the world of CASANOVA (in a way). Casanova Quinn, hated on all sides by tyrant and hero alike, must flee from time and space, aim one batch of enemies at the other, kill everybody and save everything simultaneously. Dont be afraid: you are an apocalypse dreaming of butterflies + the first part of reincarnation is dying...

This collection includes issues 1-14 of the regular series plus Gula 1-4 and Avaritia 1-3:
