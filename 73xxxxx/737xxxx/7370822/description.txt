The Mahavishnu Orchestra took the music world by storm when they arrived on the scene at New York City's Gas Light Au Go Go club in the summer of 1971. A five piece instrumental firebreathing fusion monster led by guitarist John McLaughlin which incorporated jazz, east Indian and rock elements, their loud, fast and complex music caught the gaze of jazz purisists, fans of the fledgling early 70s progrock movement as well as the curious. Even Andres Segovia sat up and took notice of the appearance of this spectacular musical phenomenom.

This 5 CD box contains the first five Mahavishnu Orchestra albums. The five classic Mahavishnu Orchestra albums, no less. Only The Lost Trident Sessions is missing here and this would had been full house. The albums are the genre defining The Inner Mounting Flame, the live album with only new stuff Between Nothingness And Eternity and the three albums Visions Of The Emerald Beyond, Apocalypse and Birds Of Fire. All albums really essential albums in a good record collection.

This box is just the music. The sound is excellent and the box offers some hours of brilliant music. This box is the perfect gift to yourselves or someone you may want to impress with your musical taste. In short - this is a box you cannot bypass. (progarchives.com)
