PS I appreciate your uploads but you might want to change your nickname. Makes you look like you're a scammer promoting a website."

,stu_douglas,2012-07-13T02:54Z,"Works great, except when i try to update i get ""Unable to connect to Parallels Update site"" Problem ID 15207. Is there any way to update it without redownloading as a new torrent?"
,general_monash,2012-07-25T08:15Z,"Confirming that this works with Mountain Lion. Thanks downloaditfreenow.

For those of you who want to turn off the naggy startup ads (trust me, you'll want to), paste this into Terminal:

defaults write com.parallels.Parallels Desktop ProductPromo.ForcePromoOff -bool YES

Parallels, if you're reading, I've bought several licenses over the years. But I'm done with no support for previous versions when Apple updates the system. The cost should include maintenance releases."
,chrisjoy,2012-07-27T03:20Z,Works perfectly with Mountain Lion. I got frustrated when my legal copy of Parallels 6 yelled at me saying it was incompatible with my current OSX. I won't be buy another copy of Parallels. Don't try to register. Won't work
,dreams822,2012-08-12T05:24Z,"I also purchased a legit copy of P6. As PD is too lazy to keep up with upgrades on an OS their company relies on, I will not be purchasing any further products. Thanks Download!"
