Instructions
1. Extract the rar file and place mkvdts2ac3.exe where you wish to keep it.
2. Drag the MKV file onTO the .exe file (Do not open .exe manually)
3. First thing it will ask is what bitrate you would like your AC3 audio to be.
If you are not sure just push enter.
4. Next it will ask you if you want to split the file into 3.7GB parts. If you
have a FAT32 device you will need to press Y. Default is set to No.
5. It will display all the streams of the MKV. Select the audio stream track ID
you wish to use. If you are unsure you can view the video file with
MediaInfo.
New file will have _AC3 on the end of the original filename!
*If you chose to split the file(s) will be labled -001,002 etc...

Notes
-Tested in Windows 7 and XP
-Some Antivirus apps may give false warnings due to embedded
files in .exe file needed for demuxing and conversion....
