[V],twentyforty,2012-06-22T21:59Z,"Few hours after you asked for Feast trilogy I ordered and got all three few hours ago and just ripped first Blu Ray (other two movies were released as DVD only).

And now I visited (fucking 26h later) to tell you a good news to see THIS. I never know would I find the sources and when it would be, right?

Well, you can assume what would be my answer from now on. "

i know lot of requests..let me know if u can do them.."
[T],bzingaz,2012-06-24T11:12Z,and one more thing if u r open to suggestions ..i know people don't seed here..some do not respect too..but i think u should upload on a public site like this or any other..
,makuna_hatata,2012-06-28T15:10Z,"too cool to reply
pink scull? duhh. he's green see
thats one episode of spongebob i got to see"
[V],twentyforty,2012-06-29T20:22Z,"@bzingaz: I appreciate your effort regarding Turkish cinema. I really do - but we all have different taste in movies. 

I seed over 3000 titles on SU - why - on TPB in 2009. I had like 90% of Hit&Runs and when I upload something here and now - 99.999%.... 

LOL. TPB is pure downloading service and aside of using the torrents has nothing common with idea of sharing anymore."
[T],bzingaz,2012-06-30T17:20Z,so that's a no right? can u send me invite on su?? that is where u r uploading right now? if u can then send invite at rinku.niec@yahoo.com
[T],bzingaz,2012-06-30T17:26Z,"i know about hit n runs ,,i myself upload a few things..and about movies..i have a mixed taste..kind of moody ..i love sexy comedies like american pie..sometimes oscar level like a separation..and sometime like the ones i requested..still keep up the good work .."
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-01T17:31Z,"Invite sent. And yes - it's sort of ""nay with reasons""... Out there is many Turkish encoders who have been doing these titles for years. Same as Hindi - it just happened that i am not doing these... I think how encoders should stick to cinemas they like and more important - understand, not just a language, but cultural origins foremost."
[T],bzingaz,2012-07-02T04:48Z,thanks for invite..if u know any uploader u can consider my requests ...then suggest me his name..
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-02T11:22Z,"Do Search one or two titles from the list, find who is uploader then click on his handle to see if he has uploaded other titles you look for. You  can find one who is productive and reliable and how he deals with requests by reading Comments on most popular torrents right there."
[T],bzingaz,2012-07-02T16:03Z,ok.thanks for the tip..i will try it..
[T],bzingaz,2012-07-02T16:22Z,"ok this one is in english and there is no small sized torrent of this..please take a look..i myself received many requests for this..Buffy the Vampire Slayer

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/"
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-02T21:31Z,"I seed the movie only, but regarding TV series, many did requested it over the years. I am not interested in encoding it, Net was full of Buffy packs (I downloaded it five-six years back and really tried to watch, but I haven't endured longer than five-six episodes). Well, if some show really have huge fan-base - why all torrents are dead? Or are they? Search on demonoid and on Google too. Usenet? Warez forums?"
[T],bzingaz,2012-07-03T04:25Z,there are few torrent with active seeds but complete series is about 60 gb..so that's why i asked that may be u can do small sized torrent..thanks for reply though..
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-03T09:07Z,"Now imagine how big is DVD set one need for doing rip.

Terabyte? Thanks, no. And to stop doing anything else for month or two - and torrent to be leeched and Hit&Run and dead within 6 months?

Nope.
