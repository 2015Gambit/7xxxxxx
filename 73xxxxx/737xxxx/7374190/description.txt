Long Distance Romancer, Jupp's first release for Chrysalis Records, continued the polished rock & roll of the second half of Juppanese, except it bettered it. Unlike Gary Brooker, producers Godley And Creme could exploit the slick, synth-based sound that Jupp was beginning to mine. However, the highly produced sound doesn't mesh with Jupp's main strength -- direct, simple rock & roll. Instead of being powered by a driving beat, "Switchboard Susan" winds up sinking in the layers of keyboards and processed guitars. Yet the production does manage to save slight songs like "You Made a Fool out of Me," creating an album of pleasant pop/rock that never manges to really sink in.
