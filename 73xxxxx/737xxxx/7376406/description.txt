Le Gospel 1939-1952 [Body & Soul] (3CD320kb)

It shouldn't be surprising that a French label is able to compile a much better gospel overview than any Americans; having looser copyright laws to work around makes the proposition more profitable. Gospel 1939-1952 is wisely separated into three discs, one of spirituals and preachers, one focusing on the modern quartet sound, and the third dealing with the fount of female-fronted gospel during the music's golden era. 

The wealth of musical jewels on display is awe-inspiring, ranging from the first selection (the primal harmonic gem "Rock My Soul" from the Golden Gate Quartet) to the last ("Nobody's Fault But Mine" from Sister Lotta Peavey). It does include a bare few of the songs found on any gospel collection worth its salt. Gospel 1939-1952 also excels by its resurrection of rare material -- "Building on the Good Shore" by Sister Rosetta Winn, "Slippin' and Slidin' Up the Golden Street" by Julius Daniels, and "Well, Well -- Don't Worry About Me" by the Five Gospel Stirrers.
