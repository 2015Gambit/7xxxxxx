How old are you? 5?

Because you sure in the fuck act like it!"
,cawoodie,2012-06-22T22:58Z,"IF!!! you can explain to me an easy way to obtain these 100 books without having to go to some website, do surveys and find out whether or not I will get them, I truly would appreciate it. Thanks"
,cawoodie,2012-06-22T23:07Z,"Please do disregard my negative comment. Meanwhile, if someone can explain to me how this epub and mobi works or doesn't work, I truly would appreciate it."

You should have just asked instead of posting irrelevant,negative comments.

I don't get my books from web sites,I have them on my servers.

Your asking where to get them,well you can easily get them here.Download a ""torrent client""install it and download this torrent  by clicking on ""Get this torrent"" on this page.

Google epub or mobi reader and download one and install it on your Computer or Laptop.You can then read all epub format ebooks.The same same goes for Mobi format.

,cawoodie,2012-06-23T01:18Z,"@bigbluesea, thanks so much for your help. I am now downloading epubs books. My initial comment was based on the frustration of being new to computers...my apologies. "
,chinook92,2012-06-23T02:20Z,"bigbluesea, I love your downloads and epub is excellent. Thank you for all your hard work. I was wondering if you take requests. An ebook came out yesterday called Finding Karla by Paula Todd. Its a small ebook, 49 pages I think.  Again, thank you for all the downloads, you keep me busy reading :)"
,sixputt,2012-06-23T05:25Z,You keep your cool very well. There are many out here in cyberspace who really appreciate what you do and we are very grateful for your efforts. Thank you.

Any chance you could get more books on carpentry topics (fences, decks, concrete, etc).

Thanks!
you are the man. "
,SportelloHM,2012-06-23T08:39Z,"@cawoodie:
If you really want to use the epubs and mobi files as they were intended, get an ebook-reader.

@bigbluesea:
Thanks for all the great torrents. Do keep them coming. 

Cheers!"

Your welcome"
,Vikingman1111,2012-06-23T17:32Z,"For the uninformed, Firefox has an add on that allows dragging epub files onto the browser and reading them. It creates a reading catalog that is accessible anytime."

Thank you very much for that info

Learn something new everyday "
,sn_1987a,2012-06-23T20:39Z,@cawoodie: Better shutting the fuck up then trying to be wisdom if you don't know how to use epub efficiently. Your comments are really stupid and childish.
,naji56,2012-06-23T22:39Z,"I would like to thanks to a person who upload this collection, please ignore the all negative comments and believe me your efforts are appreciated by many. "
,hdbrk739,2012-06-24T19:59Z,Awesome. Thanks!!
,Undauntra,2012-06-24T20:48Z,"Hi BigBlueSea.  I love what you are doing.

Do you have any Jack Vance?  He's my favorite author and I'm having a really tough time finding any books... what I can find is indifferent quality at best and with Vance it really matters that the wording is just right.

With high hopes!
