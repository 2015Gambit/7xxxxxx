this is a 25 gig blu ray of Fellowship of the Ring with the special features compressed to fit on a dvdr
the chapters have been removed on the bluray, but all the dolby digital audio remains

i will upload the remaining 2 movies in the trilogy in a few weeks time after i seed this one

the image must be burned to a 25g bdr preferably using imgburn

for the future, let me know if the initial menu and chapters are prefered left in or removed.

the special features disc can be burned to a regular dvdr
