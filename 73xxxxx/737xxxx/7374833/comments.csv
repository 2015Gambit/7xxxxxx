,MVC78,2012-06-22T03:41Z,"I don't know who HOPE is, but he just got HOUSED by the BONE!!! You called down the thunder, well now you've got it"
[H],tykoon123,2012-06-22T04:15Z,"HOPE has used the same source, but he has cropped it, sync it, did some gamma, sharpen and many more."
[H],tykoon123,2012-06-22T04:17Z,yours is 100% 3D version which is totally blurred

,BruceWayneJr,2012-06-23T01:15Z,"lol, he said ""skull fucked"""
,sky0dragon,2012-06-23T21:08Z,BONE when can we have a TS? or not a 3D version?
,Matak12,2012-06-25T08:25Z,tykoon123 who the heck are you? I have never seen any of your torrents before despite your blue skull. You must be shit. BONE is the man!
,DarkSilhouette,2012-07-01T15:44Z,"@Matak

just pointing out that .BONE. has said this copy is shit, hes not claiming anything.

I agree .BONE. is a great uploader but Tykoon was just trying to help, The HOPE version has had a makeover and although is still not really worth watching, it is better then this version.

BONE is great, but Tykoon was just trying to help. Research a little before you run your mouth."
,legio9,2012-07-08T03:55Z,"Shit is shit, no matter if you shape or crop it, add Tabasco and cheese on it: will still be shit."
,grphdsgnr,2012-07-11T04:30Z,no one really said if this is a good copy or not....so is it or just the same blurry shit
,HarleySturg,2012-07-15T21:08Z,This movie has been out for a month now. Why then isn't there a better copy yet?
,ferram1980,2012-07-18T07:58Z,"What""s wrong with you people? You have nothing better to do than to 'pretend fight' in the comments??? LOL If you don't like it, then go download it from someone else's link. I don""t see you going to record a perfect and pristine copy, so be thankful for what we have. I have downloaded many many movies that Bone uploaded, and they are always some of the best quality out of what is available. I had never registered before today, so to all who upload, thank you so much for sharing with us! :-)"

,snowdog1,2012-07-20T15:11Z,"DON'T BOTHER. Same low quality as Brave.2012.CAM.READNFO.XViD-26k.avi. Comes complete with hard subbed Japanese titles, audio crap - any volume and everybody talks with a scotthish lisp, visual - bright, unfocussed.  Wait for a better offering. But thanx for the effort, not one of the best from .bone"
,iThankful,2012-07-27T04:39Z,"As .Bone. said it is shit quality. Cams don't usually bother me too much but this one really is pretty bad. Thanks very much for uploading it just the same though :)


((Just stating the above for people interested in hearing about the quality before they choose to download. Pretty bad lol))"
