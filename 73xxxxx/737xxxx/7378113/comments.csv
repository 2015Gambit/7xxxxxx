,asdfkjjj,2012-07-11T16:37Z,"Installed fine, plays fine,  but wont save progress. GFWL is installed on my PC (XPsp3) and working, clicking the ""LIVE"" button in the Game doesn't' do anything. Seems that I can't create a local profile for this game for some reason.

If anyone has any ideas how to resolve this let me know. Otherwise I will just have to play it end to end in one sitting ;-)"
,Narator,2012-07-11T19:24Z,"@asdfkjjj Try reinstaling ""Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE Redistributable..and yes u must create local profil"

,Narator,2012-07-13T20:52Z,@cosminbh  I completed hole game! 
,Sargorn,2012-07-15T14:57Z,"I installed every update, every folder, the steam.dll and every setup (including the ones located in Disk 2) but everytime I run BatmanAC, I get the error about ""SteamRemoteStorage"" or something, I don't even know what to do anymore =("
,rtnex,2012-07-18T19:21Z,"Hi,

I followed the instructions (you should add that we have to install xlive, net, etc in the disc 2).

I can play, but I can't save the game because I have to create a profile in windows live (I did it), but when I am loged the game ask me for a game key.

Where can I find it?

Thanks!"
,Narator,2012-07-20T07:34Z,@rtnex u need to create a local profile..scroll down in creation  profile menu...ty
,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-07-24T19:33Z,"Is there like no one seeding this torrent at all? Been getting like 0.2kbps for the past couple days while my other torrents are fine.

At this rate it's going to take 2 years to download this. Retarded."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-08-07T20:58Z,"It works just fine, but i can't play any of the Riddler's Revenge modes. Keeps crashing saying it's missing files. "
,Narator,2012-08-09T02:30Z,"@EvilCorporateWhore

1. UPDATE (copy/paste to main folder of your game)

2. DLC.Pack.v3.multi9 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7404287/BAC_DLC_Pack_v3

3. Batman Arkham City - Harley Quinn's Revenge (extract to main folder of your game)

4. UPDATE 1.3 (copy/paste to main folder of your game)"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-08-10T02:28Z,"@Narator

Sweet, thanks Narator, i'll give that one a shot... i used the DLC pack from this torrent and most everything seemed to work great apart from the Riddler's Revenge games. Will let you know if i can get it working. :)"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-08-10T08:17Z,"@Narator

It works! Thanks a lot for the reply, and great torrent. :P"
,kersedsaint1,2012-08-11T04:50Z,I feel like the installation instructions are a bit vague. When you copy/paste the folders in the main folder... Do you mean copy/paste the actual folders? Or do you mean the content inside the folders should be copy pasted? (ie. Binaries and BMGame folder). When I run BatmanAC.exe it loads and nothing happens...
,kersedsaint1,2012-08-11T05:33Z,"AND. If I am copy pasted specifically the Binaries and BMGame, do I copy and replace each time?"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-08-11T08:04Z,"@kersedsaint1

You must be new to this(that's not an insult). Yes, you copy the folders within the main torrent folders, ie., the Binaries BMGame, etc and overwrite everything so you replace the older files with the newer/updated ones.

Also, use this torrent for the DLC's that Narator posted above: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7404287/BAC_DLC_Pack_v3 instead of the DLC file in this torrent(it's updated).

Lastly, don't forget step 5: Edit ""PCGame"" file and add +DLCBundlesInstalled=""Iceberg"" (save) ...it's important. Hope you get it working. :)"
,kersedsaint1,2012-08-11T10:20Z,"So I got Batman working... Harley Quinns Revenge isn't working. It's in my install folder so i dont know why isn't not. It's giving me that steam error. And yes I installed gfwlivesetuo, net, etc."
,kersedsaint1,2012-08-11T10:25Z,Yeah I guess I'm kind of new. Is the FIGHTCLUB folder in disc 2 the crack or do I ignore it?
,Narator,2012-08-11T22:42Z,@kersedsaint1 Ignore that crack
