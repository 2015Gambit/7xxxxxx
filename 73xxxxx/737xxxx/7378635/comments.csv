Yea I saw this movie some months ago at 720p and now its blowing up. I think it just came to GR in America. Even though it is an American movie."

I am not sure how much experience you have with ripping movies however this Blu-ray rip.
The original movie from the disc was in 1920x1080 however this includes the black lines at the top and bottom to preserve the original aspect ratio. See screenshot from Blu-ray.com. When ripping a movie, this is a waste of space to rip a movie with black lines. So the movie is cropped (removing the top and bottom black lines) so now the resolution is now 1920x816. You player should be able to play the video with the new 1920x816 and maintaining the original aspect ratio (by adding the black lines automatically).

Does this make sense?"
