Chew #27 (2nd Helping Edition) [IMAGE Comics]

Space Cakes Part Two

Remember last year when CHEW shocked, confounded and enraged the entire comic book industry and indeed the entire world by printing an issue out of sequence? Heres that issue all over again, in order and in context, and now jam packed with extras and supplemental material so youll feel just fine about handing us 299 pennies all over again!
