,Font0015,2012-06-28T06:50Z,"This doesn't seem to move past 36,4%?"
,msdo,2012-06-28T09:26Z,"No fair, you've got 36.4. I'm stuck at 36.3. Apparently somebody isn't seeding their 0.1% with the rest of us. This torrent has all of 7 days before I've put together a competing post that will offer actual seeding. "
,Medical.Torrents,2012-06-28T23:11Z,"Hey everyone. I couldn't figure out why nobody was able to download, despite the fact that I had not removed it from seeding, nor turned off my PC.  Turned out that I was seeding too many torrents, which was creating a problem. I have rectified it. It should continue downloading normally now."
,Medical.Torrents,2012-06-28T23:15Z,"@ msdo.

If you have the files, and will be able to better seed it, why wait the 7 days. You are more than welcome to upload your file. This isn't a competition- if it helps people study, go right ahead. 

 You don't need to be an asshole, nor do you need to drop random ultimatums"
