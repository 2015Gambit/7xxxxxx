,atlazt,2012-08-08T19:57Z,If this isn't any of the stuff packs/expansion packs or the base game then what is it?
,MellieIsJelly,2012-08-10T23:27Z,I kind of don't trust this torrent. At all. 
,shahmirazin,2012-09-05T23:47Z,"atlazt, uploader mentioned NRaas Industries, twallan, ModTheSims.. They make mods (modification) to the game.

,inthesky29,2012-09-21T07:37Z,"I'm having an issue with installing The Sims 3 game itself. (haven't had the chance to even install the expansion packs yet)

""Step 7. When, during Installation, the Istallation asks for Disk 1, click 'Browse' and select the 
StartDisk you have Mounted. (NOTE: In 'My Computer' or 'Computer' the StartDisk is
called 'SIMS3')""
This won't work for me at all. I did exactly as the installation wizard tells me, which is ""Please insert disk 1 that contains the file GameDataSharedPackagesFullBuild1.package."", except when I went to look at what was inside my SharedPackages folder, it says that the only thing I have is FullBuild0.package and there is NO FullBuild1. I don't know what to do and this is completely frustrating me."
