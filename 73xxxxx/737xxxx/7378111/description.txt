This torrent was compiled from information and files from NRaas Industries, twallan, ModTheSims, and of course Games4theworld.org. I am in no way affiliated with ANY of these groups!


This is ONLY a compilation of easy-to-follow, step by step instructions as well as every necessary file to ensure that your Sims 3 installation and gameplay run smoothly.


It took me HOURS to find all of this stuff. I don't want anyone else to go through the wild goose chase, so I popped it all in one place for you guys.


I can NOT guarantee that these fixes will work for game files downloaded and installed from another source, however I CAN guarantee that these will work for the legal DVD installations as well.


PLEASE NOTE: There is NO Sims 3 base game included, nor expansions or stuff packs in this torrent. Please go to http://www.games4theworld.org/downloads.html to download the base game plus expansions and stuff packs that you would like.
