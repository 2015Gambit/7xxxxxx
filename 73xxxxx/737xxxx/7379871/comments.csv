,varkstun,2012-06-24T04:27Z,"The Late Middle Ages has a ridiculously low amount of seeders and is likely to stay that way; you're the go-to guy for everything TTC, so it would greatly benefit those you serve if you uploaded it here in video format. Not everyone is going to read the comment in which you posted the link to the other Late Middle Ages post, and so it will continue to have the low amount of seeders that it does at the moment.
So

That's just the nature of bittorrent. Any torrent that's a few years old is likely to be poorly seeded. That goes for my torrents just the same. 

I'll tell you what.. I'll join in seeding that 'late middle ages' torrent for a week, so you should easily be able to complete the download."
