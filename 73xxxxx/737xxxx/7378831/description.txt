... the general nature of the music is more welcoming, more gentle, more
organic in its development. The intensity can change dramatically in one and
the same piece, evolving from high energy towards calm moments, yet it is the
open nature of the pieces that is its strongest characteristic. Sorey's "Slow
Burn" is indeed slow, with the least number of notes necessary to create a
great atmosphere full of tension. The tones are stretched, and remain open,
waiting for silence to evaporate them or to be replaced with new ones, quietly,
slowly. On "Canines", the open nature remains, with silence dominating,
fractured by some bluesy chords and incredibly sensitive blowing by Laubrock,
possibly one of her biggest strengths, yet slowly a theme emerges, the tempo
increases, and the piece gets some harmonic development, like a story being
told. A musical story. The whole album is like this, with linear story-telling,
careful attention to detail and overall effect, without falling back on easy
patterns.

The biggest effect comes from the slow tension-building silences that define
the overall sound : there is no hurry, the pace is measured, each note ripens
fully and almost individually. The density of the album shifts repeatedly, but
regardless of the moment, it is always very lyrical and with three musicians
working as one on the same concept. Really great.

For those interested in the album's title : the paradoxical frog is also called
the shrinking frog, because the tadpole can have three to four times the size
of the adult animal.
