When all the stores in the mall start getting robbed, Ally and a team of other mall employees set out to find who the burglar is. A security camera shows Austin taking a guitar from a display case at Sonic Boom, and Trish sends the video in to get the reward. Austin later explains that he was trying to get the guitar autographed by Bruno Mars, much to Ally and Trish's surprise. With most of the mall thinking that Austin is the culprit, the group must scramble to figure out who's really responsible.
