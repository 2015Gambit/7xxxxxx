This torrent icludes TWO games of the same kind, but totaly different anyway.

The first one, was from the beginning written to the Amiga computer by Marcell Byranyai, but Peter Liepa likes to play it on a PC, so he convert it, and that very good also. Thanks to both for a dam nice game.
This is a VERY funny game, and don't even need to be installed. (But unrar it first.)
Put this exremly tiny file in a DIRECTORY wherever you like and doubleclick on it, and play. It will make a hiscore-file (1 kb) and that's all.
It is very small, and no install need. PERFECT simply. Run it whenever you got some spare time to kill. If you need a break, just press WINDOW-button.
I have been playing this tiny game sometimes for about 15 year, and about now I think I can say I know it. It's nothing you learn in one day.

The other one, Pirates Quest made by First Star Software, Inc, is even better, bu shorter.
