,chard774,2012-06-25T02:51Z,"The hell it is. This IS last week's episode. It's the very same show of ""gunslinger"" myths that aired on the 18th."
,chard774,2012-06-25T03:18Z,"It's the very same ep that aired on the 18th. It is the ""Gunslinger"" episode. Using a nailgun as a weapon; knife to a gunfight; etc."
,Zipgun,2012-06-26T18:37Z,The hell it ISN'T dork. WTF do you idiots only watch the 1st fucking 30 seconds? It only seems similar as they are using footage from previous shows dumbass. So stop looking like an ass and watch it or dont watch it. Either way who gives a fuck foo!
