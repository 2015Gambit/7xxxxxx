The Handbook of Epictetus as translated by Nicholas P. White

This is much better than any public domain version, and since there are no good torrents for Epictetus's stuff, I thought I'd get it started with this one. Hopefully this will soon be replaced by a ""Stoic Pack"" that includes modern translations of Epictetus, Rufus, Seneca, etc.
