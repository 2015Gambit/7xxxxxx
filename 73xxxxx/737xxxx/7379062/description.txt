Acapulco Gold - 1973 - A Journey Through Marijuana History in America

Acapulco Gold is a sativa-dominant indica/sativa hybrid of Cannabis. It is likely originating from the area around Acapulco, Mexico. Acapulco Gold has strong sativa cerebral effects, offering a long lasting high that balances upbeat effects with body-relaxing, stress reducing calmness.
Acapulco Gold has been found to effectively relieve symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and chronic pain.
The clusters of buds are pale green to yellow, speckled with reddish-brown gold and covered with very visible THC crystals. The strain produces flavors and scents of fruits and spices. It is known to contain up to 23% of the active ingredient THC.
The Oxford English Dictionary quotes an early usage of the term from a 1965 newsletter, in which it was described it as "a special grade of pot growing only in the vicinity of Acapulco. The color is either brownish gold or a mixture of gold and green. This grade has a potency surpassed by few of the green varieties and usually comes at slightly higher prices or in short weights."[4] According to one linguistics book, "The gold in this phrase originally described the golden hue of the leaves on the marijuana plant, but later came to refer both to the high quality of the marijuana and to the especially high price it commanded."[5] Acapulco by itself can be used as a synonym for marijuana, generally referring to a high-grade type like Acapulco gold.[4][5] The similarly named Acapulco red, refers to a reddish-brown marijuana grown near Acapulco, Mexico with reddish tops on the plants.
