,mft57,2012-06-23T21:57Z,"I agree on most points, on the topic of Joseph Smith, however you are wrong on your statement
THERE IS NO GOD, 

The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. (psalms 14:1) KJV

my question to you is, do you want to continue to be a FOOL?

also if you do not like this material, don't download it...."
,randallytxt,2012-06-23T23:12Z,"It was very convenient for believers in the world religions in invisible, imaginary beings to say that those who do not believe are fools. The same trick by swindlers everywhere: they trick people by making them believe what they want, who really are the FOOLS? The suckers who believe them... 

The reality is: THE BELIEVER SAID IN HIS GULLIBLE HEART (NOT HIS REASON): THERE IS A GOD... and then he went on to be endlessly ripped off by the swindlers who live off religion..."
,mft57,2012-06-24T00:04Z,"well I can see you have a bitter heart, so you believe what you want to, and I'll believe what I do, ok"

Here is a question ! If I believe all of the Bible and I live the life that Jesus Teaches and I believe that my reward is everlasting life In Heaven. and I die, and it is not true, there is no heaven. then I have LOST Nothing. however,  

If I believe all of the Bible and I live the life that Jesus Teaches and I believe that my reward is everlasting life In heaven. and I die, and there is a Heaven. I have GAINED all That the Bible (God's Word) has said I would Receive. 

Now ask yourself That same Question.

I myself would not Gamble (Take a chance) with My soul ! how about you?"
,randallytxt,2012-06-24T06:36Z,"There is no soul or god or heaven, so it is a silly question, BUT supposing you were right and all those imaginary things existed, I would end up polluting your heaven since your god would enjoy much more the company of a rational, logical man who thinks for himself than that of a gullible boring yes-man believer... :-)               "
,leo4710,2012-06-24T06:50Z,"This is a pretty good documentary on the LDS church for this century. I do however recommend Dr. Walter Martin lectures or books. His book ""The Maze of Mormonism"" is amazing"
,mft57,2012-06-24T13:07Z,"randallytxt, you would not pollute heaven, because you would not be there.

leo4710 , I also have Dr. Walter Martin's Video, 
The Maze of Mormonism ! and you are correct it is 
amazing. "
,leo4710,2012-06-25T07:05Z,You should upload his lectures if you have them.
