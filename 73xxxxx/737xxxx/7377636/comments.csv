The rest of the instructions worked and I got into the game but then I couldn't get my mouse to work properly. I've read some comments about a gamepad needing to be unplugged. I have no gamepad for my PC so I don't know wtf is going on. Mouse works fine in menus, buttons work in game, just can't turn around...fixed direction.

,Seancpconn,2012-06-23T22:06Z,"Hey guys!

Just logged in just to help everyone out!

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed.

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.
8. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!"

,thegh0sts,2012-06-24T10:12Z,anyone getting the device is hung error?
,o2kool9292,2012-06-24T16:24Z,"@Jigure

For those having MOUSE PROBLEMS, this is due to other gamepads or controller such as the Razer NOSTROMO being installed.  Even if the gamepad is NOT plugged in, you may still have the issue of not being able to look around with the mouse, but mouse in menus work fine.

My problem was having the NOSTROMO installed on win7 x64.  TO FIX:


1. Go to START MENU-CONTROL PANELS-DEVICE MANAGER



2. Click on HUMAN INTERFACE DEVICES



3.  Look for RAZER NOSTROMO or any other gamepad driver, [Right Click], and DISABLE.



4.  Start GRFS

Menus should now show PC keyboard buttons instead of Xbox controller buttons.



At least for the RAZER NOSTROMO, it is not necessary to re-enable the driver in device manager while playing.  I've been able to run the NOSTROMO CONFIGURATOR and play other games using the Razer Nostromo without having to re-enable the driver.



Hope this helps anyone with the mouse problem."
,Zipgun,2012-06-24T17:01Z,"1st off I didnt download it here I never use PUBLIC trackers. Too damn slow. But anyway game works fine for me Win 7 64 bit. But my problem is on the precious cargo mission there seems to be a bug. When ya hit the key for the quicktime event. You just get the player killed screen. Anyone else got this bug? Tried the mission about a dozen times and always does the same shit.

 I'll reinstall the game and try again but if it does not work its gotta be the crack and besides this game freaking sucks it baby sits you through the whole game. Your barely involved at all its like its playing itself. Man glad I cancelled my per-order then again I had the feeling it was going to suck."

,JohnnyGhost,2012-06-25T05:55Z,"After 3 installs totally got this crack working.
Win 7, 64 bit

1. Internet on - Norton OFF (Firewall and Auto Protect)
2. Install game (used skidrows first 13 gig upload)
3. Started game  with start menu icon.
4. Game patched self = good
5. Ubisoft Sign in screen - Settings - ""Offline Mode""
6. Shut everything down
7. Copy Skidrows 3 folders to Ghost Recon Future Soldier (not Orbit)
8. Copy the folders inside the Orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder (replace - yes) 
9. ok this was weird, i then took everything in the Orbit Folder, and copied it AGAIN into the Ghost Recon Future Soldier folder... it actually reaplaced 1 folder.
10. started game again (run as apministrator), set force offline mode in settings, made a password 6 - 8 characters, remember me checked,  and the game fired right up 

After 3 installs i can't explain why it kept failing, but now it's running like a champ.

,Hp_Prince,2012-06-26T14:25Z,"Those who're having errors regarding MOUSE ..!!
Its better to disable the driver of any gamepad installed. Device manager->human interface devices -> right click on the installed gamepad-> disable 

Those who've the error ""DEVICE HUNG ..."" error.. you MUST overvolt your GPU.. For more details.. Google it ... its been reported a lot from the users having 5xx GTX cards.. 

Those who have launcher crasher error.. Sorry for the error.. Try again.. Follow each instruction carefully.. you must first UPDATE the program .. and then block it in the firewall..

1.Install the game
2.Run the game
3.Let it update ( Turn ON your network Connection )
4.After update .. the launcher will pop up.. leave the username as it is and type anything for the password and check remember me and then select forced offline
5. You must/should be able to do this only once."

Anybody...

I was able to install successfully on to hardrive and successful installation on external hardrive..

Though whenever I install either two patches, I get this error:

""This application has failed to start because DXGI.DLL was not found. Reinstalling this application may fix this problem""

Some specs:
Dell XPS 720 Duel Core
Windows XP service pack 3.

Any ideas on how to fix this error - the game will not start, not even load.

Also, I had made a UBISOFT folder for installation in my external and D hard drive.

Thanks much "

(I updated with the first patch and it made the graphics not work to the best they could. Everything was a lot brighter and some of the whites/smoke turned a light pixelated blue) Anyway, reinstalled without updating the patch and worked great. I get about a dozen or so scenes into the first mission and it crashes. It goes into the cut scene where the truck drives down the alley and the ghosts break the wall and jump out of the way. The truck crashes in front of the building and then the game crashes. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work. Tried just using without the patch and that didn't work either. Anyone have a thought/suggestion I can try to get a fix? I love guerrilla mode but the campaign seems to be calling haha. Thanks "
,Surreal419,2012-07-12T23:10Z,"ULTIMATE MOUSE FIX--------

For all of you having mouse problems.
Symptoms:  Can't aim, Can't shoot.  Menu buttons are all game controller buttons. (A,B, etc)

HOW TO FIX.
Goto Control Panel -> Device Manager -> Human Interface Devices.
STOP - Check for any game controller drivers installed. If you have one. right click -> disable

If you don't. Download Razer Nostromo Driver 2.0 HERE http://www.razersupport.com/index.php?_m=downloads&_a=viewdownload&downloaditemid=593

After install. Restart PC.  Go back to your device manager, find the Human Interface Device tab, open it. Right click your newly installed Razer Nostromo Driver, click disable. Play the game!"

,Quasi93,2012-08-25T13:02Z,"Hey guys! I have found the solution how to fix your problems and errors with Ghost Recon Future Soldier. 
1. Copy the crack into game folder.
2. (When u try to run the game, most of the people are getting error.) All u should is right click on game shortcut and run as administrator.
3. As u run it as administrator, the ubisoft log in tab will pop up. First of all click on settings, and tick the box ""start the launcher in offline mode and click apply.
4. Then type in anything in some random crap in username and password, tick remember me box below and click log in
5.Then the error will come up ""Cannot play in offline mode blah blah blah, just click ""PLAY!"" and the game will start.
Tell me if it works for u
