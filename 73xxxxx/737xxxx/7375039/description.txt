Sources......: China Town (Cheers GuYz)

Note: right not a very good source but it is the first sor, did what i can to
revive it rotated, prespective, resized,  cropped, gamma, contrast, levels,
colour, sat, medium denoisers to reduce some of  that unwanted crap in the
pixels, gave it a little sharpen and KAPOW much better but  not the greatest
either one for the cam lovers

Note2: HC chinese subs thought-out, cropped alot, plus i think there is missing
minutes unless the runtime is different for the chinese viewing i recommend u
view on pc/laptop 50% of the movie is blurred due to the 3D plus there is a couple
of dark spots no biggie but, HOPE you Enjoy
