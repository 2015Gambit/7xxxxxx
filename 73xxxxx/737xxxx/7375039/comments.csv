,Reyz0R,2012-06-23T16:24Z,"1.why do people bother uploading cams?
2.why other ppl take the same torrent and post it as their own?
3.doesnt all of this seem like a waste of time?"
,xXTheGoonXx,2012-06-23T20:09Z,"@Reyz0R, That is the stupidest fucking thing iv'e heard on a torrent site. Well let me break it down, lots of people can't wait for a dvd quality video, and the people who cam (which some cams are wonderful) make satisfaction with at least being able to watch the damn movie period. Simple enough?"
,saint84,2012-06-23T20:33Z,"would be nice otherwise. too blurry and a lot of scenes cut off and missing . at last , the audio is terrible . is the audio in 3d as well, ha ha ha ha ha......."
,H.Suzumiya,2012-06-23T21:45Z,"Yeah, it is pretty awful.  I'm really not picky...I do realize it's a cam...but even I find this one unwatchable.  Thanks for the effort though :)"

,Mordor64,2012-06-29T05:05Z,"Thanks uploader.  I realize you only only provide what is out there and your efforts are REALLY apprecaited!

But this is very bad quality.  Out of focus, terrible audio.  I just wanted to watch this, so I can see if I want to take the kids to it.  Couldn't even finish it was so bad.

,BlueBas,2012-06-29T17:12Z,"Alright, Goon, others...

Yeah, thanks to whoever for bringing us this, I'm not actually going to download it, but...

If you're going to record a movie with a handicam (or whatever), wouldn't it make a good deal more sense to NOT go to a fucking 3D movie? I see the listings for the 2D version in the paper, so it's not like it doesn't exist (even if hollywood is pushing 3D way more than people with half a brain like it)."
,spiderman-._.-ax,2012-06-30T07:47Z,will wait for the DVD release...!!!
,filehippo,2012-07-01T10:14Z,"The way i see it is this...... if this was an impecable great quality cam job, picture perfect, we wouldnt be able to have this site working for us to use.  It would be SHUT DOWN pretty fast so allow this to be the way with no bitching bout quality and just wait or go see it for ten bucks.   "
,Salem2001,2012-07-01T12:24Z,Good movie
,solari1,2012-07-01T18:32Z,"""if this was an impecable great quality cam job, picture perfect, we wouldnt be able to have this site working for us to use.""

Wrong.  I've seen plenty of great quality cams over the years.  During Emmy judging season, all the movies come out in DVD quality.

""Christ, you people are ungrateful shits.""

I should be grateful for something that's pure crap?  You must be a republican."
,Reyz0R,2012-07-02T02:45Z,"xXTheGoonXx 
 thank you for your input...NOW READ THIS: if u like watching horrible quality video PLZ dont MIND me...DENT your OWN eyes..cuz me and  9,998,764 other ppl would like to wait for a better quality that is worth of download and viewing.."
,pterrordactyls,2012-07-03T21:20Z,"unwatchable. go pay $12 to see it in theaters, it's 100% worth it. it's a visually stunning movie, and that's completely and totally lost in this. why anyone would waste their time and bandwidth on something THIS bad is beyond me. "

,Violentos,2012-07-04T07:48Z,"I'm sorry but, why isn't there a better cam version of this out now? It's popular and it's been in theaters for a number of weeks now... I don't get it? I remember 2 years ago we used to get great quality cams a week after the movie hit theaters... what happened since then?"
,zer0punk,2012-07-06T02:18Z,"yo why did this guy rate the video a 10 then go on to say how its garbage is he that dumb did he mean negetive or did he really accedently add an extra digit their or is he so stupid he doesn't realize that 10 is the highest rateing and 1 or 0 is the lowest if he really meant negitive he should realize most people put ethier a - or : to seperate v and the rating number and should have put it in () to clerify also he shouldn't be upset the poster even sed its low quilaty and the only thing he could find and people gave it low quality ratings

ty scene4all for the upload"
,mklangelo1,2012-07-06T17:05Z,"Poor video.  Blurry with double images.  But thanks any how.
"
,smknjoker,2012-07-06T22:25Z,I've seen workprints and the like leaked well before releases in theaters. And yet TPBs still here
,legio9,2012-07-06T22:32Z,"filehippo, you're an idiot: quality is not a factor if a site is shut down or not: they have tired to shut down PB for decades.

musclestud1 (Freud will be very interested in your choice of name..btw) :  Good for you if you can afford bandwidth, even if it is the only thing you can probably afford; reality is that most of all the user have to pay a lot for bandwidth...therefore accurate comments and quality is a must.

All in all, it boggle my mind that  we do not progress but regress in so many sectors on this site: Quality is mostly poor, or its the same crappiest torrent renamed over and over again.

I don't get the ""camers"" : cameras are a LOT better then few years ago..yet the quality of cams is going down?  it is possible to make fantastic cams, so WTF?

Or all those idiots who do not know the true labellings system : DVD-RIP means that it ripped FROM a DVD ( not the case in this particular torrent)

Have a sens of pride and achievement for god sake! : If you upload something, upload something of QUALITY , not crap so blurry or of poor audio that you basically stop watching after few minutes! 

Personally, I prefer to wait a bit more, download a much bigger file IF it is a DVD or blue ray quality, even if it cost me more bandwidth wise (and it is expensive here)..as I will enjoy the movie more...long time. (Lol!)

As per the eternal imbeciles that says "" if you're not happy buy the DVD or go to the movies"" : Well dear little bitches: what are YOU doing here then?   PB is NOT only a way to get torrent, but also to fight against the system and help others who can't afford the overpriced theaters and such..so every DVD taken is a spike to the system.

Don;t even get me started with the one that upload fake torrents...There should have their balls cooked in boiling oil and served back to them with marinara sauce..for a start.

So here is an ACCURATE rating:

V=  3
(2 1/2 for been stupid enough to lose portion of it)

A= 3
M= everyone has their own taste, so its not my place to comment on the movie itself."
,szissou,2012-07-07T02:13Z,"Do yourself a favor and spend $10 on this one.  It is well worth the money.  Great movie, stunning animation, amazing theater presence, and overall perfectly entertaining.  Quit complaining, turn off your computer, quit being a tight ass and spend some money for an incredible experience."

Heard horrible things about this movie. Watched the cam, it's not great quality.. but the movie intrigued me enough to go buy the movie tickets.  It's actually a lot better than the reviews said it would be.  "
,Joanamacedo,2012-07-09T04:36Z,I don't get how can the quality be so bad and so many people download it... Lol... I'll wait for a better quality...
,xxbeanxx,2012-07-10T08:19Z,i dont know if its true where you come from  but all the places around here are in 3d so of course these cams are gonne be shit 
,tedwu,2012-07-13T11:10Z,thanks for chance to preview this. But I may have to buy a ticket still. My eyes are just not what they used to be.
,Khym21077,2012-07-14T19:51Z,Thanks for the effort but I've got vertigo & just looking at the screenshots makes me dizzy alrdy. It's been out since June 22nd and yet still no decent CAM that at least wouldn't give you a headache...Y oh Y?!!
,BlackB3rry29,2012-07-18T05:56Z,"ok once again, just tell us who has the best so far. stop bad mouthin and move on. yu guys need 2 get it 2gether or move on. and everybody always got something 2 say and wont seed or vice-versa. and pls dont worry bout me i do my part!!!!!!!!!"
,HarleySturg,2012-07-18T07:27Z,I'm surprised that there's not a better copy of this out yet.
,ciropabon,2012-07-21T02:16Z,"@sohan: yeah, it sure worked for you, as long as you wish to give the hackers of the site your credit card number ""for purposes of verification"". How dumb do you think we are? (pretty dumb, I guess)."

,Calamakuya,2012-07-24T17:54Z,"*Runs outta here, scared to death by the quality*

I contribute nothing by saying this CAM quality approaches the CRAP category with good possibilities of winning the CRAPPIEST EVER prize, so I won't say it, tho I'll only think it out."

,snowdog1,2012-07-28T04:28Z,Quality same as others - not very good. Run time is 01:19:56... not 01:24:00
,legio9,2012-07-30T19:37Z,"Love the way people comment """"good for a cam"" , I wonder if they rate their lunch compared to dog shit too?

This is an EXCELLENT version compared to cavemen drawing on walls done with rocks.

No matter the ""source"", the END RESULT compared to something ""watchable"" of decent quality:  is a complete waste of bandwidth, an INSULT to technology and is thus rated by this unique neutral standard:

ALL versions as of this date (July 30th)
