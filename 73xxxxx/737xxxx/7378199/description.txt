This is the fix from 3DM for Civilization 5 Gods & Kings
It avoids the crash issue each time you try to use the MOD button (happens only if you don't use the original game), and also fixes several other issues (such as the babylonian thing it seems).
Simply extract the files in the directory where you installed the game, overwrite the existing files, and voila !

It's not my work, I've just found it while searching for a way to avoid the MOD crash, downloaded it on a Direct Download site, tested it, and since it fixed my issue, I thought it may interest other Civ 5 Gods & Kings fans.

Enjoy !
