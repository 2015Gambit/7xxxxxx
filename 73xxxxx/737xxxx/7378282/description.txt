For the better part of the past half-decade, members of the modern rock trio Mainstay knew they wanted to pursue a balance of artistry and ministry as their lifelong passion. After coming together as a punk outlet in members' suburban Minnesota garages and refining its sound to a more sophisticated alternative style come college in Minneapolis, the gang amassed a sizable audience and considerable record label interest. 

"Our mission is to first of all write songs that would be pop gems with a great hook and a great line that will stick with you," Anderson summarizes. "Lyrically we want to write lyrics that challenge believers and unbelievers alike that will hopefully encourage them all to look for truth. Absolutes are everywhere and hopefully our music will allow everyone to think beyond themselves and get in touch with a Higher Purpose."
