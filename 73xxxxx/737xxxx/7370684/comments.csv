,philipjayfry,2012-06-22T22:23Z,"patch keeps telling me that the patching failed. :o( tried putting it in the install dir and just about any subdir. am i missing anything? also, it seems awfully large for a patch (3 MB) and the installer seems awfully small (7 MB). didn't ruin the vm i've been testing it in though.

could you maybe provide the patched files? or does the patcher use any machine specific information like mac addresses?"
,toecap,2012-06-26T14:11Z,same problem here
[T],mrriser007,2012-06-27T21:05Z,"@philipjayfry

done"
,philipjayfry,2012-07-01T19:55Z,"hey mrriser,
thanks for the response, but i did of course made sure that the application is closed while attempting to patch. i even tried installing it in different languages (which apparently just changes an .ini file entry) and on several different systems (xp 32, 7 64...).

pleeease just upload the patched installation folder, that should be the most simple workaround."

Thanks mate!"
,philipjayfry,2012-07-20T19:46Z,"kudos to fridens for figuring that one out!

alas, my xp 32 is a german version, so the %programfiles% dir is called programme and it didn't work there either.

somewhat poor design on the patch being hardcoded to a specific folder, but hey, its free..."
,thereasonifailed,2012-08-09T04:10Z,"Simple Fix; let it install where it wants.  Once done installing to somewhere other than C:Program Files; copy the ""Kroll Ontrack"" folder to C:Program Files; run the patch and then CUT the ""Kroll Ontrack"" folder from C:Program Files back to it's original location.  Done and Done!"
