Will you be posting more eps?"
,Froglet,2012-08-18T13:54Z,"Thanks PirateBoy. Imagine my disgust when I tried to re-watch this on the train last night and I had accidentally downloaded the English-dubbed version with no way to change back to Japanese. This is the way it should be watched.

DarkWeetus this is it, it is a self-contained story in 13 episodes. There is an OVA, and it's not bad, but it's not necessary at all."
