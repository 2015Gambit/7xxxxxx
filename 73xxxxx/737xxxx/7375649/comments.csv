Below this comment, may exist spoilers. We have a frustrated child called @mentallyours who posts useless comments.
You don't read under any circumstances his comments if you don't want to know the score of the game!

,nba4me,2012-06-23T18:48Z,"Thanks Nepotu. I've been going through a lot of shit in my family life. Its sad that there is a moron who wants to spoil your good work. Its sad that's all that person has in their life. There's so much much more to life than being a spoiler on the internet. Ignore the negatives, and be open to the positives in life, you my friend are doing good work. Again thank you very much for all of you work."
