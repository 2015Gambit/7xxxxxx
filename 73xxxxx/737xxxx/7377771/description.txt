Beck must destroy an energy drill before its destructive power destabilizes the Grid and threatens Argon City, a feat made more difficult as a light cycle race cuts through the danger zone. While warning the racers of the bomb he intend to plant on the drill, Beck is overheard by Paige, who plans to stop him.
