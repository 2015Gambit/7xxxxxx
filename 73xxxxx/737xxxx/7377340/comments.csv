I think you will find that the quality is quite good for the file size!"

,igby,2012-07-05T00:07Z,"hey there!

is there anyway you could upload the extras from season 4? 

see, I'd love to listen to the commentaries before starting the new season, and since I live in Brazil, there's not even a release date for this here yet... considering that the 4th season hasn't even aired...

please, if you could do this huge favor i'd be eternally grateful!

thanks"
,[khemist],2012-07-06T04:47Z,"igby,

since you asked nicely, i will do that. i will try to do it tomorrow but it might have to wait until the weekend. i will include a link in the comments for this torrent."
,[khemist],2012-07-06T15:26Z,"i think i will just do a full ""special features"" torrent, since none seems to be available. i will do the commentaries, deleted scenes, and all the behind the scenes stuff.

it really is great material if you are a BB diehard!"

,igby,2012-07-17T05:08Z,"[khemist] thank you so, so, so so fucking much!!

you really have no idea how excited I am to hear what Vince Gilligan and Giancarlo Esposito have to say about the final three episodes, especially!

I'll be checking this page daily for the link... but no worries, take your time.

and thanks once again...

PS.  if there's anything I can do for you let me know!! anything... I have tons of rarities here, DVDs, BDs., etc... or anything from Brazil that maybe you wouldn't be able find wherever you live! I'll ship it for you... just don't ask me for a hot girlfriend, it's been hard enough to find one for myself!

,DisRuptive1,2012-08-03T10:07Z,No subtitles for Episode 7.  I DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH.
,DisRuptive1,2012-08-03T11:10Z,How do I access the subtitles?  Multiple episodes have Spanish language with no English subtitles.
,superlol1,2012-08-29T22:48Z,"Why the hell did you make it so big? It would be fine a little over half this size, with no noticeable difference in quality.  "
