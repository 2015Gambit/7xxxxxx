,Brainfryd,2012-07-15T23:22Z,"Doesn't seem to want to work on ICS 4.0.3.  (Samsung Galaxy S2).  Updated to latest Lucky Patcher as well (2.0.8.1), still fails to completely disable / bypass the license check on FPse about a minute or two into a game.

If you have no desire to have any audio though, this will probably work fine.

Hundreds of sites claim Lucky Patcher 1.5.1 will break all versions of FPse, but I'm just not naive enough to try it.

Files are all legit, just won't work on all phones :("
