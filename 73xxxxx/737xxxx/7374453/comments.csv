,NCC86,2012-07-19T03:16Z,You're welcome. I was surprised to find that these albums were pretty scattered on TPB and thought it was a good time to compile them together in good quality audio. The Rolling Stones DESPERATELY need to standardize their catalog and reissue it like The Beatles did.

Will there be a post-1974 of the Stones?

Thanks in advance!"
