The rarest of the rare. This movie was withdrawn from circulation after Ainu actors complained about the way they were portrayed.

Ishiro Honda, fresh from his triumph with Gojira/Godzilla, decided to tackle the Yeti. This is decidedly a monster movie in the tradition of King Kong; it lacks the anguished subtext and noir photography of Gojira, or the creepiness of the snowy wastes in The Abominable Snowman (1957) - which also had an environmental philosophical theme.

Still, Honda has legions of admirers, and this is an important milestone in his career. It is not to be confused with Half Human, a bastardized version of this movie with clumsy English-language inserts.
