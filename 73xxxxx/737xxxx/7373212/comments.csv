You should try with http://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/new-working-xgd3-bypass-method.611241/, usually solves the problem. You may have to wait a while though for them to upload the file for this game. 

My problem is that the game ask me to update my xbox, which is far worse. I guess I have to do it and then reflash to be able to play, or does anyone know any way to go around an update? 

However, thanks for the game boobsman."
