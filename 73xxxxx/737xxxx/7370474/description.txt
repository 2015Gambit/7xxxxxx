 Dr. Baldev Chaddha , a well qualified        
 fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic    
 and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi,   
 that guarantees a high quality and           
 specialized sperm for the purpose.           
 Unfortunately he has more failed cases to    
 his credit than successes. A healthy, high   
 performing donor is the need of the hour.    
 Vicky Arora , a young, good-looking, Punjabi 
 boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and   
 of no financial support to Dolly, a widow,   
 who runs a small beauty parlor from home.    
 As luck would have it, a small brawl in      
 the colony brings Dr Chaddha and Vicky,      
 face to face, where Chaddha, concludes that  
 Vicky could be THAT donor he has been looking
 for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights 
 are spent in convincing Vicky to become a    
 donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds  
 his love interest in Ashima Roy , a pretty
