,OmniNegro,2012-06-22T23:32Z,"Is there even an emulator that can play those two latest games?

And what about controls? Most of these can be faked well enough wth keyboard remapping, but those latest two would be a royal bitch to play on a PC even with a perfect emulator. I am interested in them, but purely from nostalgia. 

I will wait and see if I can pick them up used for cheap somewhere when some kid gets rid of the current system for the next one.

Thank you though. :)"
