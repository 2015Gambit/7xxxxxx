Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Marc Morano of the Climate Depot website on the Wednesday, June 20 edition of the Alex Jones Show. Morano is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as the man-made climate change secretariats convene under the globalist umbrella of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and Earth Summit 2012.
[NOTE: Marc Morano was scheduled, but did not appear due to communication problems.]

Alex also covers important news stories of the day, including the secret Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, Rubio's vetting by the Bilderbergers as Romney's running mate, and Ron Paul's assertion that he will not support the establishment Republican choice to run against his ideological cousin fronted by the Democrats. 

Alex also talks with radio host Mancow Muller on today's worldwide transmission.     

[NOTE: Although not mentioned in theshow description, Alex talks at length (from 12:00 in hour 2 through 17:00 in hour 3) with Dr. Peter Glidden. The Glidden interview is in large part an infomercial for Alex's supplement marketing web site (infowarsteam.com) and the Youngevity products sold there.]
