Spec Ops The Line XBOX360-iMARS

Spec Ops: The Line is a provocative and gripping third-person modern military 
shooter that challenges playersΓÇÖ morality by putting them in the middle of 
unspeakable situations where unimaginable choices affecting human life must 
be made. Spec Ops: The Line unfolds within the destroyed opulence of Dubai. 
Once the playground for the worldΓÇÖs wealthiest elite, Dubai has fallen victim 
to a series of cataclysmic sandstorms. The cityΓÇÖs ultramodern architecture lies 
half-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city 
plays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but 
unpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course 
of the game. While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the 
sandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad 
remained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in 
Dubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until 
they picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. 
Army Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to 
infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience 
ΓÇ£The LineΓÇ¥, that razorΓÇÖs edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line 
they cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end ΓÇö of self 
and sanity ΓÇö when their duty is done and only they remain.
