[V],boobsman,2012-06-23T16:50Z,"@ hkk9 sorry mate it already takes me too long to get uploads sorted out as it is without looking for and adding extra files. If you want covers then try this site, they also do disc artwork for those who have printable discs:

,DeathOfLife01,2012-06-23T21:06Z,Whats with all the .rar files I liked it better without having to unzip everything
,dududus,2012-06-23T23:18Z,"DeathOfLife01/

scene release is always in rar

torrents have hash checks so rars are complely unnecessary but scene rules nuke it otherwise

put an mp3 on a stick, put it into the xbox and start the mp3. afterwards you start the game from hdd and it will work."

,WPX_TacoMan477,2012-08-16T07:42Z,"@ruski.boy:
your asking how to ""rip"" xbox 360 games, google it,
to play ripped games you must burn them onto discs called DVD+R DL discs and dont use any other brand than virbatim becase the sucsess rate is flawless
your xbox requires flashing to play these backup games and is not for ametues (just for anyones info! i dont gotta spell correcly) "
,gunsout,2012-08-26T18:59Z, this game wont give me an iso can someone help me please
,yllibi,2012-09-11T15:51Z,"when I insert the dvd it asks for an update from dvd, will this ruin the LT. 2.0 flash???
