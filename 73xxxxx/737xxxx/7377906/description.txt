Ivan er præst og bor i kollektiv med alkoholikeren Gunnar, tankstations-røveren Khalid og den lidt enfoldige Sarah. Ivan ser generelt det bedste i andre mennesker og byder derfor velkommen i kollektivet til nynazisten Adam, som skal afsone 12 ugers samfundstjeneste.


Eng:

Ivan is a priest in a rural church known for the apples that grow on a large tree in front. He's odd: seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, in denial about personal facts, and convinced he's at war with Satan. The rectory is a half-way house for recently paroled convicts. Adam arrives for 12 weeks, a large, tough neo-Nazi, first baffled by Ivan's thick-headed optimism, then angry. He vows to break Ivan's faith. Meanwhile, in exasperation at Ivan's insistence, Adam sets a personal goal: to bake an apple pie. All goes awry for the tree: crows, worms, lightening. The Book of Job gives Adam perverse insight, and his hooligan mates provide the resolution's spring.
