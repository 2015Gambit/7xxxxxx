[S],soda,2012-06-23T04:26Z,"You have been told repeatedly that we will not delete torrents uploaded by other people just because you claim to ""own"" them, and that you should stop pm'ing different moderators trying to get a different answer.  You've refused to listen so now we've removed your VIP status.  

We will reconsider your status in two weeks."
,Hggh12345,2012-06-23T05:05Z,but this is extremezone we are talking about here...? only has the top of almost every non tv related torrents on tpb at all times D:
,mikebogina,2012-06-23T07:23Z,"Im confused...is the mod talking about EZ?  O.o
"
,sherriff89,2012-06-23T07:28Z,"@Soda, I do see what you mean but I also see that his uploads are always legit and trustworthy, whether he complains about people ""re-uploading"" and stealing his stuff should have nothing to do with his VIP status, thats just complete BS and I am 100% sure that if extremezone wasnt uploading on here you wouldnt have even half the activity on this site. "
,sherriff89,2012-06-23T07:30Z,"Yes Hg and Mike he is talking about Extremezone, as far as I can tell it wouldnt let extreme upload the new Future Soldier because DibyaTPB stole his upload and it wouldnt let him post it, (like I said as far as I can tell, most of the posts have been deleted) "
,Blasky412,2012-06-23T07:40Z,VIP to Trusted WTF!!!
,bobby358,2012-06-23T07:41Z,EZ's uploads are best so if he leaves you might as well shut down tpb lol
,mikebogina,2012-06-23T08:02Z,Shouldnt the mod pm him instead of making a public comment on one of his torrents? And how do you steal someone's upload and upload it before them? @_@
,bobby358,2012-06-23T08:10Z,"admin this is the way to dig ur grave, you removed EZ's vip status-doesnt matter to us cos we know hes best uploader here, but if he stops uploading stuff here tpb will be gone too, wait and see."
[V],extremezone,2012-06-23T08:36Z,yeah vip to trusted...again i learn my mind not to chat not much with tpb crew for nothing...thanks for this will never ever request support on forum from now
[V],extremezone,2012-06-23T08:42Z,all what i've requested was to rename that torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7374566/The_Recon_Soldier to proper name and move it to correct category but i was named ignorant and banned from forum for few weeks...end of disscusion maybe i will get my trusted account also removed because i'm saying this...
[V],extremezone,2012-06-23T09:06Z,my last comment about this because i forgot to say it previously: let's just say that i was wrong on suprbay forum and i was deserved few weeks ban but what this have to do with my vip account since i didn't do anything wrong on thepiratebay? we're talking about other sites/organisations totalitarism but what just happened here? ... please don't remove my trusted status just for saying this or remove my these three comments
,epic_seeder97,2012-06-23T09:20Z,i am with u EZ U are the best at uploading u should be given back VIP status 
,epic_seeder97,2012-06-23T09:22Z,"@soda 

EZ deserves a VIP status as he is the only uploader who uploads all games, movies, etc "
,Chaoz6,2012-06-23T09:49Z,How come theres no Ghost Recon FS? Its on Extratorrent o.o
,ATTILATHEHUN79,2012-06-23T11:05Z,"I don't know if you have any pluss benefit if you are a VIP member not just a trusted, but i can tell that, that i don't care if you have a blue skull or a green next to your name, hell i don't care if you have any skull i'll always will come to you if i looking for something. You are in the top 5 uploaders here. Keep up the good job."

,-WallpaperZ-,2012-06-23T20:23Z,EZ i dont think TPB realize that you are the one that holds this whole site together....:
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-23T20:57Z,"Extremezone is awesome, BUT they do not hold tpb together. They are definitly 1 of a few though.

Extremezone could completely stop uploading today and nothing would happen, tpb would continue, other uploaders will take over.

Other uploaders have just as much access to the origonal content that EZ does. (EZ please correct me if you know otherwise)

EZ does none of its own cracking of games or ripping of movies. (Once again EZ correct me if I am talking out of my ass) So if EZ leave it will not have any real effect.

Anyway although I said if EZ leaves it wont effect anything, I do not want them to leave. When a new game/ movie comes out 80% (estimate) will got to EZ to download, meaning faster speeds and a torrent that stays healthy for ages. 

I hope Extremzone do get their VIP skull back though, it is trully deserved."
,The012Freak,2012-06-23T21:26Z,"@extremezone  
It's really hard to see you like this, your one of the top up-loader in TPB, i hope you get back your green skull ASAP.... Don't you worry about the negative comments posted by others.. you just keep up the good work...."

you are still a vip uploader to me & u will remain."

The Green Skull Didn't Come Just Soo.

I Was Uploader Way Back In Mininova days and When The Site Went down I Joined The Bay Officially, although I Uploaded Bout 3 torrents little before The site closed. My green skull came when Users Requested Me Be VIP ON Bay forums. and So On,, happy to give U this Info. > thx for asking"
[V],blaze69,2012-06-23T23:25Z,"@ extremezone.

If U don't mind If I say. Ur Uploads Speeds Are Very High along with sedboxes , even tho Ur Upload Been stolen and The mods/admins at tpb just neglected This.

Will it Hurt to recreate The Torrent and Reupload It as In New hash/New Torrent. Rename It To Ur Liking and Post Ur Own screens Or some from ur Previous. ?

Probally Kinda Hard To ask that, Knowing that U gotta Upload Another 12. something gigs and Counting. But Honestly , when It comes To PC/Movies games On TPB most users Visit ur Bookmarjed Profile For Ur Uploads

Reply will u ?"
