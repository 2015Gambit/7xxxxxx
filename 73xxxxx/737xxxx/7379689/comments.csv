I'll continue to upload randomly, or would consider requests."
,nav20,2012-06-23T19:05Z,use FastStone Photo Resizer to resize it. You can save 70-75% space
,Spiritualflame,2012-06-23T20:15Z,"Thanks, that would be a way to go,  but I'm determined I'mma uploading these at the highest resolution possible, and in a form usable by all."
,nav20,2012-06-23T20:46Z,try to load small size (1920X1280) version too with high resolution. It will give low bandwidth users a choice to download.
