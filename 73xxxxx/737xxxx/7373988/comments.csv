The game works! but there is a Bug with the Babylon civ, can't play with, if some bug happens when you gone to select the civ, simple do a alt+tab to windows and alt+tab back to game.

So far so good"
,Minsc_Boo,2012-06-24T18:11Z,To solve the problems with the Babylons just disable them in the game menu
,Minsc_Boo,2012-06-24T18:13Z,"The game works fine, after disable the babylons but  when you try to load a saved game it crash!

Anyone knows how to solve this?"
