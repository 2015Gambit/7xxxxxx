From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, June 21 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with David Icke. David is a former BBC television sports presenter and spokesman for the Green Party. He is the author of 19 books, including Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' from, Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More and And the Truth Shall Set You Free: The 21st Century Edition. Alex also runs down Obama's claim of executive privilege for his crony, Eric Holder at the Justice Department, and other important and breaking news, including a racist campaign by the elite to divide and conquer.

Though not mentioned in the web site's description, Marc Morano is on with Alex from the UN "Earth Summit" in Rio during the last half-hour of the show.
