Carol Reed remains an enormous gift to English film making, and this one is a jewel among many including The Third Man, his most famous. The story has less topical relevance today because the IRA and its fight with the English government has faded into history, but the human side of this tale is universal. Who is our brother's keeper and who shares and demonstrates true Christian compassion? These critical issues underlie Johnny's dilemma as he attempts to  survive and escape to another life. All who know him are challenged to help or reject him, and unfortunately only a few  have the pure souls to do the right thing."
