Seeding until I report back with any issues (:

,HungryHitmonchan,2012-06-23T14:35Z,one problem I've found is that when you go to your pokemon in the menu if always freezes
,Phazze,2012-06-23T16:53Z,"I've got mine running seemingly perfect with an early english patch, magnificent."
,tulling1337,2012-06-25T00:27Z,Is this for emulator?
,tulling1337,2012-06-25T00:27Z,"And if it is, is it for 3DS or Wii U?"
,SuperNothing28,2012-06-25T23:56Z,"I downloaded it, i use an R4i to play on my DSi, i placed the NDS file (the game from the zip) in the folder on the R4i where all the games that i play with the R4i are, in the DSi, using R4i, when i click on Pokemon Black 2 it loads then it says: 
load rom errcode=-4
I tried on both of them but the same happens, do i have to do something to make it work? i don't know a lot about this but do i have to put it in a specific folder or something?"
,Zombiesaysgrr,2012-06-28T18:09Z,"@SuperNothing28 download a DS emulator and just play on the computer, it's so much easier. "
