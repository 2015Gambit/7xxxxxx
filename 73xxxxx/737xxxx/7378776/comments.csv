Can u please upload all the seasons of Lupan III in English Dub in 720p if possible or 480p in .mkv please please please!!! "
,Shadow416,2012-06-27T05:19Z,"I'm guessing the Buu saga for Kai isn't completed yet huh? 

Excellent upload man I was missing the rest of the cell games, thank you!"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-27T20:08Z,there is no BUu saga for Kai
,bish33,2012-06-29T18:36Z,not to plot the audio is Japanese language and has grown over the size of videos
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-29T21:57Z,"bish what are you talking about?

is Dual Audio and English As first track."
,bish33,2012-06-30T13:48Z,Japanese audio Daman4Iife has increased the size of the videos you do not have to introduce at church.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-30T14:09Z,japanese audio only takes about 5GB total since its only 2.0 stereo the english audio on the other hand is triple that of the japanese
,bish33,2012-06-30T14:24Z,Right there is a chance to sweep any Japanese audio
,Shadow416,2012-07-03T21:47Z,"a lot of people prefer japanese audio over the english.

I finished watching the cell games excellent quality and it was great that it was the uncut version too (showing blood n all that). 

It's unfortunate that the Buu Saga isn't included in Kai i really liked that Saga."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-04T00:16Z,shadow the Buu Saga is the best in all of DBZ. is extremely long and we all love when goku goes SSj3
,Link-sama,2012-07-04T16:36Z,Could somebody help me? I'm downloading this but even when my utorrent says I have many seeders I cant get a good download speed (it says I connect only to 5 of 350+ seeders) anyone could help me with this? I've downloading for a week now...
,Shadow416,2012-07-04T20:01Z,"it also depend's on your internet connection.

if you have other downloads going on or someone else in your household is having other downloads in process it'll drain bandwidth. If you don't have any of that do a speed test with utorrent. 

While you have an active download in the utorrent window bottom right you should see one of 3 colours. 

Red circle = not connecting 
Orange Triangle = connection is weak
Green circle = connection is good

Click the icon whatever colour it is, and run the speed test, if everything is working the speed test will tell you its successful and give you your upload and download speed. If successful close it and then resume your stopped downloads. And your speed should pick up.

If the test fails theres an issue with your internet connection maybe a port or something."
,PinkSalad,2012-07-06T02:43Z,Please seed peps I havent seen this since i was a kid. so excited
,PinkSalad,2012-07-06T02:46Z,look at the ratio comon people SEEEEEED!!!!@
,L0KiZ0R,2012-07-06T12:18Z,"Excellent torrent! I just wanted to know :if there are so many seeders, why is the download speed so slow compared to other downloads? I have no problem waiting, thanks for the upload!"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-06T18:11Z,theres 7x more leechers
,weaping_reaper,2012-07-07T09:05Z,Is it suppose to look just a little blurry? 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-07T09:29Z,"not sure what you mean, but Use K-lite Codecs."
,intrepid9,2012-07-09T00:16Z,Is this being watch by any media company? Comcast has multiple bots and I get better speeds without using a VPN.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-09T01:42Z,"I havent had any complains yet, so not likely that is being watched."
,aquila7570,2012-07-09T15:25Z,"Great Stuff~~ thx 
and btw are the subtitles included?"
,intrepid9,2012-07-13T16:15Z,"Yes, subtitles are hardcoded, but the subtitles aren't the same as what is being said. Great Quality. Finally finished and have seeded 17 GB"
,mkfanatic,2012-07-13T18:41Z,What's up with the watermark looking thing that flashes up for a half sec throughout the episodes? I only see it when I'm streaming to my PS3 through PS3 Media Server. When I play it on my computer I don't see it.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-13T21:43Z,"Subtitles are not Hardocdded, Use MPC to View the Videos. Download K-lite Codecs. "
,mkfanatic,2012-07-14T12:00Z,"Nevermind, turns out it was just the subtitles. It was causing a weird effect when I streamed it to my ps3. It would distort, stretch, over-lay, and discolor the subtitles to the very middle of the screen and pop up for only a fraction of a second about every 5 to 10 seconds so I removed the subtitles from the file."
,TrueGlitch84,2012-07-14T14:59Z,the subs arnt even what there saying : its like 4 kids did it....... sins they ruin most shows
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-14T16:57Z,"True you have no idea what your talking about. the japanese and english Scripts are different thats why the subs arent the same as the english voices. 

if you know japanese then youw ill know that the subs are pretty accurate wit the japanese audio."
,weaping_reaper,2012-07-17T06:39Z,"@Daman4life, yup, their different.. I use to always love watching regular DBZ in english audio, but would always turn the English subs on So I could read the original dialog. 
Also, I don't know if I want to try K-lite again, I remember trying that years ago when I first started using VLC, and I don't think I liked it as much because I could only run the K-lite codecs thru Windows Media Player.. and since I couldn't adjust aspect ratio or go above 100% volume, I just stuck with VLC, and have never regretted it.. I wasn't really complaining about the quality when I said it was a tad blurry, This quality is AMAZING dude!   and since my last comment, I've tweaked with the picture settings, and added just a tad of sharpness to it, and have come to relize even more, Just how AWESOME your upload is, Thank you a Million times bro, You are Awesome!"
,pengbot,2012-07-20T01:49Z,"thanks for the upload, but what's with the subtitles? many times, the words get cut off for the last few letters at the edge of the screen. is there anyway to fix this?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-20T03:43Z,Sigh i even wrote it in the description use K-lite codecs/MPC VLC does not support PGS subs thats why they arent playing correctly
,rocklee1,2012-07-29T07:26Z,i downloaded the first episode i keep getting these weird screen glitches every few seconds that makes the show unwatchable. This sometimes happens with other videos I download but it's doing it a lot with this one. How do I fix this?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-29T18:40Z,rocklee like i said in the description Download K-lite Codecs or use the latest VLC. 
,MZDisaster,2012-08-03T23:29Z,"seed pls, downloading at max 10KB :("
,robertserrao,2012-08-04T15:08Z,"@Daman4Iife 
is this the CUT or UNCUT version? "
,kalabueh,2012-08-05T20:32Z,MPC doesn't wrok for mac and with vlc (latest version) the subtitles get cut. 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-05T22:17Z,"Robert if you see the titles it says Blu ray, who sells blu rays that does not have the originals so obviously is the one that has blood man."
,anarchy69,2012-08-11T05:55Z,will u guys seed please so i can download this tonight 
,robertserrao,2012-08-13T04:18Z,Of course! Silly me... Thanks for the clarification :)
,b3t4n,2012-08-13T18:31Z,"The second chapter has 2 audio tracks, both in english, i've downloaded it wrong?"
,OverKi11,2012-08-21T08:55Z,"I have updated (or uninstalled/re-installed) newest k-lite, and also have two audio tracks in english, any suggestion?

Great work btw"
,Plinkey,2012-08-23T06:12Z,"Well started downloading, and I am downing just as fast as I am uploading, so equal downing and seeding time for me. Currently at 34.5 Gb So let's see what happens"
,andrerfd,2012-08-24T21:59Z,"Thanks Daman4Iife! Downloading it now and will seed! Hope you someone else does seed to, because at this rate will take 3 weeks... :("
,ViagraOS,2012-08-27T00:51Z,Seed please im downloading at 10kB/s or less
,vlad_ivx,2012-09-10T02:42Z,thanks . good job!
,pbbf,2012-09-11T20:45Z,"I'm getting only English on both channels on several players, one being MPC and I have the KLite codecs. Please don't tell me this was a wasted 35gb of bandwidth..."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-12T02:54Z,Pbbf theres Both English and Japanese Try using VLC or something else
,paulolupa,2012-09-14T14:54Z,"I appreciate the upload, and I'll seed it till at least 2.0.

But, as said above, and I can confirm, at least EP 2 does not have japanese audio. It has 2 english audio tracks. Since I only downloaded the first 20, I can confirm at least so far, it is a problem with only ep 2. 

If another episode has the same problem, I'll post it here. "
