,HaVoC_850,2012-07-14T17:02Z,Its not 720p. Don't download this if you wanted the 720p ver (this is a TS ver).
,OmniNegro,2012-07-16T18:10Z,"All Camera rips suck. This will be no exception.

But note that resolution is the number of pixels of the image size. Therefore, this at 1280 x 560 *IS* high resolution. But that in no way means it has good quality or is high definition. Learn the difference you freeloading retards!

Steal whatever you want. But this garbage is labeled correctly."
,HaVoC_850,2012-07-19T15:51Z,"@ OmniNegro - It might be labeled OK, but it is confusing the masses. You need to think like idiots..."
,dannyfff,2012-07-20T14:55Z,"Whaa Whaa. Let me resize it to 720p then if that makes you happy. So you can call it ""HD"". People are so obsessed with the resolution but not the actual picture quality"
,imORIGNAL,2012-08-10T05:07Z,@jtata download the sample
