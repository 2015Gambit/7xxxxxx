Game information
=================

Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings is the first expansion pack for
Civilization V - the critically acclaimed 2010 PC Game of the  Year.  This
robust expansion covers the entire scope of time from founding your  first
Pantheon of the Gods and spreading religion across the world, to deploying
spies in enemy cities in order to steal information and technology.

As  you  move  through  the  ages,  you'll  interact  with  new  types  of
city-states, engage in new  city-state  quests  and  global  competitions,
and  master  exciting  new  systems  for  land  and  naval  combat.
Civilization V: Gods and Kings will also include nine  new  civilizations,
nine new wonders, three original  scenarios,  and  dozens  of  new  units,
buildings, and techs that  will  offer  even  more  ways  for  players  to
dominate the world
