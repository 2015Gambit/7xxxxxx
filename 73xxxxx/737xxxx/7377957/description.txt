Software Info

Eufloria is an ambient game of space exploration and conquest that
employs surprising themes of plant growth and bio mechanical evolution

The game allows the player to explore a beautifully realized universe
rendered in a style that is both unique and compelling. Eufloria's
aesthetics are reminiscent of children's books like "the little
prince" and the gameplay is supported by an original ambient
soundtrack by Brian Grainger

Gameplay revolves around conquering asteroids in space and using their
resources to literally grow and nurture new semi-organic plants and
creatures to do the player's bidding

The player is pitched again several teams of AI opponents that all vie
for the same resources and can offer fierce opposition

A single player campaign boasting 25 diverse levels

A skirmish mode with 8 highly replayable additional levels

An unlockable 3rd mode with new graphics, and tougher AI

Procedural content that makes each play session unique
