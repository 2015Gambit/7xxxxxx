American Weed
All-new series American Weed finds Colorado medical marijuana businesses under scrutiny and facing mounting pressures from local residents. Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fund-raisers. As the oldest of 11 kids, Josh relies heavily on several of his brothers to work at the grove and keep his business supplied in medical marijuana. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the ten-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado?
Episode 2: Weed-Jacked!
The fight against medical marijuana is on, and Proposition 300 will be voted on in the next month to determine if all marijuana dispensaries will be banned in Fort Collins, CO. Josh Stanleys shop is robbed by a pipe-wielding perpetrator who clubs an employee and steals much of the weed inventory (an incident that's caught on tape). And Sgt. Jim Gerhard receives a call about a man illegally growing marijuana in his backyard that makes his blood boil.
