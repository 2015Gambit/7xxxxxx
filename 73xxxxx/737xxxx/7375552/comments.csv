[V],psspss,2012-06-23T11:38Z,"Note S02 is a better source then S01
also some episodes in S01 are newer sources

but all were vhsrips someone did and uploaded to
a web stream.. they never did share them on p2p

I ripped them from the stream back to xvids

so the bitrate was fitted and pixel sizing small

so the quality sucks.. but is watchable on laptop

YOU WILL need VLC video sharpener active to improve it ! "
