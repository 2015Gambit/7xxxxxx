WHAT THOSE "IN THE KNOW" SAY

I wish that every citizen of every country in the free world and every slave behind the Iron Curtain might read this book.
Ezra Taft Benson ΓÇö Former Secretary of Agriculture

NDCC is an admirable job of amassing information to prove that communism is socialism and socialism (a plot to enslave the world) is not a movement of the downtrodden but a scheme supported and directed by the wealthiest of people.
If enough Americans read and act upon NDCC, they really can save the Republic from the conspirators ΓÇö whose plans for the destruction of our country are galloping fast toward completion.

Dan Smoot ΓÇö Former Assistant to J. Edgar Hoover

Now that NDCC is available, I no longer need to answer "no" to the question which is often put to me, namely: "Mr. Dodd, is there a book which I can read so I can know what you know?" No higher praise is possible for this book.
Norman Dodd ΓÇö Chief Investigator Reece Committee to Investigate Foundations

This book concerns the way in which our nation and other nations are actually governed. As Benjamin Disaeli said, this is not the way in which most people think nations are governed. The whole subject of the Insiders who so largely control our political and economic lives is a fascinating mystery.
For the reader who is intelligent but uninitiated in the literature of superpolitics, I can think of no better introduction to the field than NDCC.
