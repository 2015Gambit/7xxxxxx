Press meeting held for Marley's acceptance of the 'Third World Peace Medal'. Bob talks to the press about politics and his convictions, with humor, but also fiercely going at it at times. Plus there's an emotional moment when Bob receives the medal from the funny UN official. Unique document about 'the man behind the music'.

One Love!
