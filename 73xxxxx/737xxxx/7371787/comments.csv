,xpmule,2012-06-21T06:36Z,"seeing how popular these torrents are
makes me wonder why they cancelled this show in the past. networks are retarded !"
,STEALTHYJUNK,2012-06-21T07:59Z,"yeah, this show's been cancelled so many times they had to make 4 movies to keep the thing alive. I'm so happy we have new episodes right now!"

,pukica,2012-06-21T19:31Z,the best series ever
,trancejoe,2012-06-21T23:45Z,"@xpmule the show probably wouldn't have been cancelled if people would have bought more merch and watched it on the tele more, rather than DL'ing.  Personally I'm here so I can watch it many times until the new season box comes out.  I own them all and all 4 movies to date.  Not that I'm against torrenting, but if you have the money, support what you love or it will surely go away."
,stuXter83,2012-06-24T14:41Z,"This is the best episode ever! :P
funny as hell!!"
,canadianlonewolf,2012-06-25T05:29Z,"These new futurama episodes don't air in Canada for, my guess, another year. Unless Adult Swim brings them on in July.

Thanks EZ"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-06-25T14:20Z,"been waiting for season 7 for like 3 weeks...
It airs (5 days ago), and i friggin forget all about.
HOLY CRAP! Pretty much while I was typing this, episode 1 finished D/L'ing in 1 minute and 35 seconds- pretty impressive!"
