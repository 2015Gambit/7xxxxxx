It's hard to find his stuff so get it while you can,

I would recommend going to see him, although you should have been quicker, before the momentum, because his shows always sell out in 4 minutes now. He probably is the best stand-up I've ever heard, so if that's your art-form, you should listen. The radio shows have a great late-night radio exclusivity feel too.

This torrent is stuff I've found all over the place in the last couple of years without really looking too hard. Included:

Stand-up:
Cardiff Glee Club
Live in Hull
The Edinburgh Podcast things

Radio:
On Triple R
Listening Hour

Please feel free to just grab the stand-up stuff if you want to test whether you like him, Cardiff and Hull are best.

And please seed to 1.0 because this torrent is only ever gonna have a handful of seeders.

Thanks
