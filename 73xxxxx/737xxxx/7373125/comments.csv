Thanks for update... Ching_ Liu"
,Mr.Quipster,2012-06-29T18:03Z,"Patch not working for me. ""Windows cannot find specific path"" & ""don't have appropriate permissions."" I''ve done everything I can and without desired results. I've ran the .exe as admin, I have taken ownership of the folder and it's contents, and I have rebooted to rule out troubleshooting. A little help please!! >.> "
