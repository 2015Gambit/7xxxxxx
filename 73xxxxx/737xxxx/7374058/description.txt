United Pursuit Band ΓÇô A musical collective bound together by friendship, united in vision, and living together in community...United Pursuit Band defies today's worship genre norms, always reaching for more. Their sound is diverse as their members, ranging from soaring worship anthems to powerful ballads, mixed in with folk influences and even a bit of gospel soul. What started as a dream, now has found its expression in a destiny-driven group of friends spanning this nation. Band member Nathan Fray states their purpose clearly: "Our mission is to create a culture of worship and of hosting God's presence, all centered around community living. It's in this place of God's life-giving presence that our songs are born and we pray will stir the heart of a generation to love Jesus and pursue Him with everything. This is our united pursuit."
