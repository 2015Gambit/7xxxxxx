Hardware:
WICK011LP ==> Jico SAS ==> Shure M97 @ Yamaha YP-511 ==> Musical Fidelity V-LPS ==> M-Audio Fast Track Pro

Software:
Mac OS X 10.6.5:CoreAudio:Capture @ 24bit/96kHz Ardour 2.8.11:trim iZotope RX2 Advanced 2.00.253 flac 1.2.1 

I just resampled the songs to 48Khz, because I think it's a waste of space and resources encode music for general listening (even producing in a lot of cases) at those samples rates.

P.S. for the first downloader of this torrent: my upload speed is quiet low (around 40Kb/s, so, very low), so you must be REALLY patient downloading this thing.

Also, SUPPORT the artist buying his stuff: albums, merchandising, etc. :D"
