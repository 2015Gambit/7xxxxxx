In the heart of Stockholm is a man buried alive. Suddenly popping up everywhere on wooden 
crates in which the victims were brutally murdered in the same. It is Martin Beck and his team 
to deal with the sadistic serial killer responsible for these atrocities. But the culprit seems 
to them always a step ahead

Beck: Buried Alive is the last movie in the Beck series was made. Fans need not worry that the 
film is unintelligible without the four seasons of Beck first post. Previous experience is not 
necessary in this story, based on the crime novels of the Swedish couple Sjöwall Wahlöö and 
wrote in the seventies. Distributor Lumière also gives a box with the book under the title 
screen adaptations: Beck: The Book adaptations. Can not miss. Buried Alive is based on the 
characters from the books, but is at least as good as the original.

Beck: Buried Alive, is another Scandinavian thriller in the now long tradition of including 
Wallander and Van Veeteren. Inspector Martin Beck, played by Peter Haber, a sadistic serial 
killer who try to stop burying people alive everywhere in Stockholm. He is assisted by his 
faithful colleague Gunvald Larsson, played by Mikael Brandt Press. The Dutch public knows Peter 
Haber of its more sinister role as Martin Fowler in Millennium I (Men Who Hate Women), a role 
that stands in stark contrast with the winning Beck. The role of the Swedish police inspector 
Haber sits like a glove, not surprising after less than 26 episodes of 90 minutes. Beck is not 
only strongly influenced by the Superintendent, the series should also have his sense of humor. 
The short fuse and sarcasm Larsson provides the necessary relaxation during the investigations. 
Also funny is the crazy neighbor Beck, who with a band around his neck seems to have 
permanently sick and always in for a drink.

The plot is similar to most Scandinavian thrillers. It is very well organized, with emphasis on 
human psyche and enough twists. The subject of the film is somewhat less socially oriented than 
is visible in the original work of Sjöwall and Wahlöö, but this is more a plus than a minus 
missing. An exciting film, and a nice opportunity to get acquainted with Beck.
