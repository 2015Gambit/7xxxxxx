,Menchii,2012-07-01T13:39Z,"This torrent works perfectly.  Mount the image and then read the pdf inside for instructions.  Follow it step my step and you will be fine.  I just played online with my friend.  I could see other games in the lobby part too.  

Mage Suicide Simulator FTW!!!"
,Assyel,2012-07-01T13:44Z,Thx for the info Menchii
,lauris3722,2012-07-02T15:17Z,Works perfectly! Thanks.
,Walkier,2012-07-07T19:12Z,"It is the most decent Magicka torrent I've seen. It seems to work but I just can't see it in the library in steam. When I open the exe, it opens the store page of Magicka instead. Can anyone help?"
,lovtojrk,2012-07-11T09:26Z,this really works. you need to read the manual on how to make this game works :D
,gjds77,2012-07-14T02:49Z,"I'm getting the same problem as Walkier. Seems like a good torrent, though."
,gjds77,2012-07-14T02:52Z,"Ah, never mind, fixed! Was opening steam clienti nstead of smartsteam."
,JohnT74,2012-07-15T04:54Z,Is there any way to play this in LAN without Hamachi?
,buruge,2012-07-19T00:50Z,Can anyone help me?! smartsteam isn't found anywhere. and I keep booting up the original steam and it goes to the magicka store site....
,HakitoJin,2012-07-21T14:46Z,"Works, but you need to start smartsteam, not steam.

Though I can't make it work online."

,GassySerbian,2012-07-28T22:09Z,"FUCK YOU YOU MOTHERFUCKING BASTARD, YOU TRICKED US ALL!!! I INSTALL IT AND EVERYTHING BUT WHENEVER I RUN THE GAME IT JUST SHOWS ME THE MAGICKA PAGE ON STEAM, DOESNT CREATE ANYTHING IN THE GAME LIBRARY, THE EXE FILE IS ACTUALLY A CONFIG FILE, WHICH IS CORRUPT, AND THE SMARTSTEAM HAS NO EXE FILE AND CANNOT BE RUN! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, IT DOESNT WORK!!!!!!"
,GassySerbian,2012-07-28T22:11Z,"WALKIER AND GJDS SAME PROBLEM HERE, BUT I THINK IT IS THE UPLOADER WHO DIDNT MAKE THE SETUP RIGHT."
,GassySerbian,2012-07-28T22:14Z,"There is no SmartSteam exe file, those shittheads who are commenting that the torrent is good are just the uploaders friends, so he told them to comment positively, but the torrent doesnt work"
,GassySerbian,2012-07-28T23:04Z,"Guys I'm really sorry for my little brother, but something really is wrong. I install it and I run Magicka from Start Menu, but it doesnt have an icon. It turns on Steam, I log in and gets me to the Magicka page in Store every time I try to run it. It doesnt create a shortcut in the games library. The Magicka exe file seems to be a config file and , also, there is no exe file for SmartSteam. Can someone please help me? I really want to play this game with my friends... :((("

,rehmaja,2012-09-16T18:34Z,"works great you need to run smartsteam, if it goes to steam then exit go to task manager and then end the steam process, run smartsteam again and it should work. took me about 30 minutes and 15 downloads to figure it out but it works. seeding now"
,rehmaja,2012-09-17T21:37Z,"step by step to run it because my last one may have been hard to understand:
1 right click on the task bar, click start task manager
2 go to processes
3 find steam.exe (click) end process (click), yes. if there is no steam.exe then skip this step
4 start menu, search smartsteam, click icon
5 wait for it to log in, go to library 
6 type in the search box (top left) magicka
7 click play and your on your way to total destruction... of yourself
Now if you still cant follow these instructions then the downloads messed up, or more likely, your just plain not smart a good example is rage face up there (gassyserbian) if your reading this, no one likes to hear your senseless rages typed in caps, doesn't help anything. If you think a torrent doesn't work you don't caps lock about it on the comments."
