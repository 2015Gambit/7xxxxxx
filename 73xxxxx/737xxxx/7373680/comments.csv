Don't waste your time, its not worth 3.7GB, should be more like 200MB"
,tsivour,2012-09-03T13:31Z,paatdl you really need to go learn some good manners or you may batter need to do some computer lessons... your upload is deep shit quality and without having to download it to check. Its shit like you and your uploads. Use your computer to do other things like opening text files or something or better go wash some dishes I think you will do that better
,tsivour,2012-09-03T13:36Z,Its deep shit quality like you. Go wash some dishes and please leave computers for experts
,HooglyBoogly,2012-09-04T21:49Z,"To all of you idiots screaming about the shit quality: It CLEARLY states ""HDTS"" in the title of this torrent. 

I agree, the HD doesn't mean shit. It's either a Telesync (TS), or it's not. No such thing as a high definition telesync. A Telecine, on the other hand, would be a totally different story. 

Enough of the bullshit, though: This is a complete waste of space at 3.73 GB. Whether it was a few hundred megs, or 10 gigs it would still look like crap. Stop throwing HD in your titles. This is the farthest thing from high definition you crafty bastard. "
