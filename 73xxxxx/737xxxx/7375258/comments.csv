,Seancpconn,2012-06-23T22:08Z,"Hey guys!

Just logged in just to help everyone out!

Here's what you do to bypass the launcher issue when everything is installed correctly and the steps are followed.

1. Start the game – the Ubisoft autopatch will update it automatically, and you should let it do it
2. The Ubisoft Game Launcher screen comes up.
3. Click on Settings. Check Force Offline. Exit the window.
4. Go to your crack folder, open the orbit folder: copy & paste the contents of the orbit folder to the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder in:
(C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for x64 based systems
(C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher) for X86 Based Systems
*You may want to disable your anti-virus on this step just in case*
5. Open Futuresoldier.exe. Notice that the username SKiDROW is already there. Leave it.
6. Make a password 6-8 characters long. Check Remember Me
*Make sure the Force Offline mode is checked – Hit Apply*
7. Click Log in.
8. You will get a screen saying: “The Uplay Launcher is in offline mode. You can play the game, but other Uplay features are not available offline”. Ignore. Hit PLAY!"

,Hokrollo,2012-06-24T10:20Z,Does the has to be copied to Ghost Recon folder or Ubisoft Launch folder? Doesn't work with Ghost Recon for me.
,Zipgun,2012-06-24T17:00Z,"1st off I didnt download it here I never use PUBLIC trackers. Too damn slow. But anyway game works fine for me Win 7 64 bit. But my problem is on the precious cargo mission there seems to be a bug. When ya hit the key for the quicktime event. You just get the player killed screen. Anyone else got this bug? Tried the mission about a dozen times and always does the same shit.

 I'll reinstall the game and try again but if it does not work its gotta be the crack and besides this game freaking sucks it baby sits you through the whole game. Your barely involved at all its like its playing itself. Man glad I cancelled my per-order then again I had the feeling it was going to suck."

,arby80,2012-06-25T03:17Z,This is a virus.  I do not know how no one else has had problems.  It did not install like a normal ISO/DVD (would not auto load) I opened the DVD from power ISO and tried to install from the install file and then it came up with a error message that it could not install because of missing files.  And then I was not able to log access google on chrome do to security issues and bing would take me to spam sites.  I had to reinstall windows for 2 days.  Then like a fool I thought that it was not this file that was the virus and tried it again with the same result.  Fortunately a system restore seems to have fixed the problems.  !!!BEWARE!!!
