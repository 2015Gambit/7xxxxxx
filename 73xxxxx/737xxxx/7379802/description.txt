Dustin, an amiable guy, is in love with Alexis, a coworker. When she tells him she just 
wants to be friends, he hires his roommate Tank, a fast-talking, amoral scoundrel who 
has a side business: men whose women have dumped them hire Tank to take their ex-girlfriends 
out on the date from Hell, to drive the women back into their old boyfriends' arms.
