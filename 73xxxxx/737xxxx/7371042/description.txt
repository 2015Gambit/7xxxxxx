NOTE::::I upload these games and apps because these are excellent and help us make full use of our Playbook....but these are very costly and also require credit cards....Thats why i may not upload games that are available at cheap rates at the app world(eg:Gameloft games)......If u can Buy then please buy Them cause it hurts the developers financially

Enjoy....n PLS SEED!!!! and dont forget to +1
