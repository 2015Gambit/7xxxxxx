*****************************

At the end of the first season of Falling Skies, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) abandoned the human resistance to wander on board an alien spacecraft. That's a pretty big cliffhanger to end on. However, the cliff only hangs so long. While the 2nd Mass is involved in a fierce firefight with an alien patrol they've ambushed, guess who comes wandering back into the group (and also into the line of his son Ben's fire)? If you said Tom, you'd be right! Disregarding his brother Hal's orders, Ben promptly shoots his returning father, ostensibly by mistake. Happy Father's Day, Tom! Welcome back and here's a bullet for your troubles!
