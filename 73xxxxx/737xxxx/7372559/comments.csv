You need to own the game legally to download them for free."

Street Fighter X Tekken- by SKIDROW first

Well you were right about it only working with a legit copy you still need a product key to get things rolling. The options are there but you still gotta be signed in to download content or battle online. If you do have the original game and find it incomplete then this should help..............a bit.

By The Way Nice Job "
