If anyone has followed me here on The Pirate Bay, you may know that I spend a whole lot of time torrenting yearly compilations, and the occasional discography.  But what you might not know is that I would much prefer to torrent based upon specific requests such as Tranqued recently made for this Gungor compilation.

So this is a call for requests.  If I've got it, and you want it, I'll do what I can to seed it!  I obviously don't have everything, but I do have quite a bit to choose from.  Maybe I have what you're looking for.

If you've made requests of me in the past, perhaps in some of my older threads, please know that I don't often revisit those threads.  So chances are I never saw your request.  But I would be honored to take a crack at seeing if I have what you're looking for now.  Just let it be known."

,jboog3085,2012-06-23T04:12Z,Dude what you are doing is totally amazing! Thank you so much! Do you think it would be possible to put up some stuff by Eddie James or The Ramp Band? Either way thanks again this is a super blessing.
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-06-23T15:20Z,"jboog3085, unfortunately I don't have anything from The Ramp Band, but I do have a few from Eddie James.  Let me see what he has out there, and work on a quick Eddie James discography for you.  I'm about ready to put up another 2012 The Year In, so it may be a day or so.  God bless ya!  :)"
,Tranqued,2012-06-24T11:43Z,Awsome! Thank you so much!
