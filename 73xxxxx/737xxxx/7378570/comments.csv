,thomasphavong,2012-06-23T08:15Z,Password protected. Don't waste out time.
,TsarB0mba,2012-06-23T08:49Z,"@thomasphavong is an idiot - there are no .rar or other archive files in this torrent, just an mp4 and the usual .txt files. Not passworded, impossible to password, and from a trusted uploader. Not to mention it contains the better of the two rips from the UFC event.

Thank you again for the timely and quality upload, scene4all. Fffffffffffffffforget the haters."
,d_gorn,2012-06-23T08:59Z,"Password protected AND requires you to ""complete an offer"".

What an asshole. Save your bandwidth."
[V],scene4all,2012-06-23T09:50Z,"lol don't bother with these guys, they are here only to prevent people from downloading by saying fake/password protected. Coz every download = less $$$"
,dismalabysmal,2012-06-23T10:06Z,"I do not understand the people lying about it being password protected(it isn't)

Where is this coming from ""Competing"" uploaders who want the turf that would benefit them zero? Or are they just sad fat retards who having nothing more in life than popping zits on their back?"
,soilent,2012-06-23T11:25Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Password protected. This torrent is BS. It makes you go to a website and tries to get you to complete an offer. No thanks!
,nightyv,2012-06-23T15:43Z,"Could someone explain why there are dip$hits saying this is password protected when it is obvious it is not?? 

Are these some morons that have some kind of stake in whether people pay to watch this event or just sour pusses who dont like people to enjoy things because of their own patheticness? Or are these idiots people who work for goverment agencies and this is their way/attempt to stop pirating??

Just because a goverment thinks it has the right to try and control citizens free actions and what they watch for entertainment, doesnt make it right.

I think the world needs a revolution against these pompous people/goverments. Entertainment cannot be only for the masses with $$$.....the entire world, rich, poor, must be able to enjoy things."
,.Leto.,2012-06-23T18:50Z,"no wonder spectators were booing during the main event. guida & maynard barely hit other, it's like they didn't want to fight. really lame, unless you enjoy seeing two fighters dancing for 5 long and boring rounds.
thanks for the upload anyway."
,.Leto.,2012-06-23T19:32Z,"btw don't get mad because I have posted some ""spoilers"", you're going to fast-forward that fight, believe me. good thing we don't have to pay to see things like this."
,thomasphavong,2012-06-23T20:18Z,"I'm not here to waste my time either (nor anyone elses), and I hate to see anyone get their panties bunched up here... but truth is after I dl'd it, I extracted the .rar file and the .avi came up, when you click on it, it asks for a password. No lie, just truth. We're all here for the same reasons, please don't waste our time/bandwidth. I'm not a troll. Normal person like everyone else, so don't call me a liar. Have a good weekend!! Oh, and enjoy tonight's fight =) "
,123qe,2012-06-24T02:32Z,@thomasphavong is a lying cocksucker. There is no RAR file so you can't even extract anything. Now please go play in some traffic.
,PoopInMyGravy,2012-06-25T07:08Z,It's ridiculous to say that there's a password on this. I downloaded it and watched it with no problems; video and audio are good quality.
,You_Muppet,2012-07-01T09:09Z,"S4A is a trusted uploader, simple as that. Green skull = good quality shit.

As for the torrent, I give it 8s for the audio and video. Ta

If you're not sure whether to spend a few hours downloading this torrent, try this quick test: start the download (sorry, you can't avoid this bit) and check out the file extension in the 'file info'... it's an MP4 not an rar!! This fact alone makes @thomasphavong a liar or at best a muppet."
