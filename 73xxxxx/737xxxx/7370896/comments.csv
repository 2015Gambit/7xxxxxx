,OmniNegro,2012-06-21T04:15Z,"Just to remind those who may misunderstand...

Superseeding is something you do when you and only you will be seeding the torrent. Seed normally any time where there may be more than just you seeding. Check around and look up the term if you do not believe me."
,Phillinny,2012-06-21T05:25Z,"Alright, thanks for the tip OmniNegro!"
