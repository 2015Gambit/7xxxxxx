,daba_1,2012-07-27T19:30Z,"Rhino's Greg Kihn retrospective is definitive, drawing from each of the straightforward pop-rocker's albums, including all of his hit singles, and even continuing his long history of album titles built around name-derived puns (1981's Rockihnroll, 1985's Citizen Kihn, etc.). Kihnsolidation includes the hits ""Breakup Song"" and ""Jeopardy,"" as well as the smooth, Hall & Oates-ish ""Lucky"" and the rollicking rocker ""Reunited."" Kihn imbues Bruce Springsteen's ""For You"" with a '60s sensibility that works especially well in the chiming chorus. While Kihn's albums had a tendency toward filler, Kihnsolidation includes all the strongest album cuts to complement the hit singles. ""Madison Avenue"" and ""Any Other Woman,"" in particular, are real gems. Essential for any fan of Kihn, the Beserkley Records sound, or solid rock & roll."
