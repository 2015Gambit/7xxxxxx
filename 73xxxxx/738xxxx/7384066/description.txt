This is a lot of different programs that will help you make your desktop super slick.  =)  I spent hours making mine look how it does now and creating installers, fixing issues, researching how to make things work, etc.  This allowed me to to compile a nice clear and concise installation method for you to use and you should have your desktop customized in about 15 minutes to an hour, depending on what you want to do to it.  I got rid of the brunt of the labour for you.

Here's a list of the software included.  Everything is able to be downloaded separately, but I'd like to stop seeding this in a week, so it'd be nice if you downloaded it all and seeded for a while too.


Software:

Themes for Windows 7:
1.) HUD Launch (Yellow)
2.) HUD Evolution (Blue)
3.) HUD Apocalypse (Red)
4.) HUD Red Premium
5.) HUD Red Original
6.) Icon packs for all themes

Gadgets:
1.) Rainmeter
2.) Enigma theme
3.) LEXIS theme
4.) Dark Glass 2 theme (I created an installer for it.)

The "My Mods" directory has modified versions of the .ini files for the above gadget themes so you don't have to modify them yourself as much.


Tools:
1.) All required patchers to allow you to use 3rd party themes of Windows 7.
2.) 7tsp (For the icon packs and things)
3.) Stardock CursorFX and the cursor I'm using in the screenshot
4.) Stardock Fences (To keep your desktop icons where you want them so you can have gadgets everywhere instead.  lol)

Extras:
1.) 2 Wallpapers that match the screenshots of my desktop
2.) 2 screenshots of my system and sample images of the HUD themes
3.) Instructions to make your desktop look like mine.
4.) Other miscellaneous tools
5.) My gadget backup for easy setup to get your desktop looking how mine is set up.
