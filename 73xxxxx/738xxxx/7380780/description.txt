Yellow Fever
1998
English

A love story set in 90s London, following the life of Monty, a gay Chinese anglophile, desperately seeking his "white knight".

A chance encounter with his new Chinese neighbor, Jai Ming, turns Monty's Vivienne Westwood wardrobe upside down. Initially repulsed by the idea of being with his own kind, Monty experiences unfamiliar feelings of attraction followed by reactionary denial and a long overdue look in the mirror at his own inferiority complex.

A modern comedy with a dash of camp and a trace of glamour, Yellow Fever is an offbeat and witty portrayal of gay Chinese subculture in a European-dominated society.
