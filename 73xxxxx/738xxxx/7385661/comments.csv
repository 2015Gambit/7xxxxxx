Nope!

Where do my new mods go?

,Jchero,2012-07-07T17:43Z,"I am stuck at step 2. when i tried to start Nexus, it crashed and a tracelog is found in my documents. HELP!"
,-xbt-,2012-07-09T00:42Z,"@Jchero: I doubt that you are telling the truth. I think you just work for the Nexus Forums and are trying to keep people from installing this. No one else has had this issue. Also there would never be a ""tracelog"" file found in your Documents folder after running an application."
,-xbt-,2012-07-09T00:43Z,"@Aitanos: YOU HAVE TO RUN THE APPLICATION FIRST, THEN CLOSE IT. 

4) Run NexusClient.exe
5) CLOSE THE APPLICATION when it asks you for username"
,Jchero,2012-07-17T09:41Z,I'm sorry for the misunderstanding i have given you. I thought i have to use the original NMM then crack it.
