Also, according to three sources - Wikipedia, IMDB, and blu-ray.com - the official length of this movie is 110 (1 hour 50 minutes). The running time of this release is 113 (1 hour 53 minutes). I'm presuming that the extra three minutes come into play from all the skipping.

That being said, the video quality is excellent. However, the skipping does take away from the movie. I'm surprised that there are not more uploads but I am going to keep an eye out for a better version. Thank you anyway uploader. "
