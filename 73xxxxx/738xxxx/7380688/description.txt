These are the ThumpNugget and tosteve scans of BYTE magazine. Please visit 
http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/167235-byte-magazine/ to learn more. These
are the full resolution PDFs, not the down-sampled PDFs found in another torrent
which is considerably smaller (11GB) but still very high-quality. 

Non-overlapping issues from Marcus B. have also been included. For various 
reasons these issues should be rescanned and replaced.

This is a work-in-progress so *please* contribute if you have missing issues 
and the time and resources to create *high-quality* scans!
