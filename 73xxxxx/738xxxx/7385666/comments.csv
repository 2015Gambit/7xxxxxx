,-xbt-,2012-06-25T15:48Z,"FAQ:

Q: When activating more than one, it gives me a popup, to choose ""Yes, Upgrade"" or ""No, Activate Normally"". Which do I choose?
A: Choose ""No, Activate Normally"", for each one.

Q: I am presented with an option asking me whether I want to overwrite files. Why and what do I choose?
A: You got this dialog box because you installed another mod which modified the same files. My suggestion is to simply choose the ""No To All"" option.

Q: After installing this mod, my game runs really slow and/or lag and/or crashes. Why and how do I fix the issue?
A: This happens because your computer graphics card is not powerful enough. In order to use this you really need to have a graphics card of 580M (laptop) or better (desktop), and you should have 2GB or more of dedicated graphics card memory GDDR5. The alternative is just to get the LITE version instead of the full version."

,IzayaOrihara,2012-08-12T03:31Z,Thanks for this. I couldn't get the towns part from the Nexus website because the download kept disconnecting and restarting whenever I got towards the last 100MB.
