Neecha Nagar aka Lowly City is a 1946  film directed by Chetan Anand. Written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, this film was a pioneering effort in social realism in Indian cinema, and paved the way for many such 'Parallel Cinema' films by other directors and many of them written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas. It starred Chetan Anand's wife, Uma Anand, Rafiq Ahmed, Kamini Kaushal, and Zohra Sehgal.

It became the very first Indian film to gain international recognition, after it shared the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film (Best Film) award at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946.

It was based on a Hindi story, Neecha Nagar, written by Hayatulla Ansari, which in turn was inspired by Russian writer Maxim GorkyΓÇÖs Lower Depths. It took an expressionist look at the gulf between the rich and poor in the society.
