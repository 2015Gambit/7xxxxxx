,Malvoy,2012-06-26T07:10Z,Recorded in 2012? lol   why not just label it what it is? Classic em tracks from the late 90s and early 2000s
,J-RedtheRed,2012-08-14T00:06Z,lame....at least 3 of these songs arent even Eminem. Most of the songs are only a min and a half or two min freestyles from years ago.  the rest are amature made remixes of old songs.
