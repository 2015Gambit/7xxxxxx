,2ndzone,2012-06-26T12:26Z,its a scene release bby rlsbb...the virus may be in the keygen as many of them have it
,drlowrey,2012-08-16T10:25Z,"this thing doesn't work, it won't register. every attempt results in ""Registration failed!""  i think the keygen is not matched for the version of the program. ie, the keygen was probably made for an earlier version. worthless torrent.

and to the comments abt a virus in the keygen... i ran Norton 360 on the files in this release and all checked out OK. keygens are notorious for triggering false alarms in low-rent anti-virus engines. so i think the keygen is clean, its just the wrong one for this release."
