,mcompton,2012-06-27T04:02Z,"Hey everyone.  This is Matt Compton, Producer of Midnight Son.  I really hope you enjoy watching the film.  We all put a huge amount of effort into making it, and we’re very proud of how it turned out.

The film was made by people who love making movies, and funded mostly by ourselves, family & friends.  It was made on a very small budget – a truly “independent” film.  Sadly, it’s become incredibly difficult for independent filmmakers to make their money back on their films nowadays, and that’s certainly true for us.

If you enjoy the film and would like to support us, I’d like to ask that you please consider buying a copy on DVD when it’s released (July 17 in the US & Canada; we don’t know dates for any other countries yet).  Or, you could also donate to us directly via Paypal, at our email address: midnightsonmovie@yahoo.com

Thanks, and enjoy the movie!"

,creative_expansion,2012-06-27T06:17Z,thanks!! looks really good! can't wait to watch it!
,jushin,2012-06-27T07:52Z,"@mcompton
I'd really like to hear how it turns out!
Please post an update later on if you got some money. 
Thanks."
,MrSlay,2012-06-27T11:39Z,"@ Matt Compton. i think you are full of shit. and i bet a million dollars that you are not the real Matt Compton. Matt Compton would never do such a thing as writing the above crap on The Pirate Bay.
And asking for money through PayPal sounds more like a bloody scam to me.
Watch out people this is dodgy as hell."
,NoCoerce,2012-06-27T14:49Z,"Matt Compton, read this very carefully and make sure you fully understand its meaning.

Your appeal to economy and emotions don't affect me one little bit. Your kind have for a very long time got the States protection to stop others from copying your work. Carpenters and plumbers never had such a protection when they found a new way of doing things. 

If you don't like your work to be copyed, don't show it to anybody!

If it's important to make movies, find new methodes to finance them. The Age is over when you don't have to be clever at only one profesion to succeed. 

I've got news for you. There are ways out there where third party are more than happy to pay for your work and take a risk. You just have to give in to bobble ads.

I really hope you would be able to understand we got no moral scuples what so ever to copy yours and any other movie making moron out there who believe they can own bit-series of high and lows.

I will never ever (directly) buy for a movie again and I copy with great conscience.

Am I making myself clear? Are you sure you did understand it all?"
,1dissident,2012-06-27T19:28Z,"@NoCoerce

I'm pretty sure tradesmen have enjoyed similar protection, though not necessarily as automatic... I believe they are called ""patents,"" and you can sue people who use them without permission, or ""licensing"".  You may have heard of these concepts.  

Your attitude is quite disheartening, honestly.  You sound like a smug thief, in possession of an entitlement complex.  This community exists because of individuals willing to share - your attitude speaks more like ""I take what I want, and screw you.""  

I bet you have a lot of really good, honest friends."
,mcompton,2012-06-27T22:20Z,"@MrSlay: I understand your skepticism.  Anyone could have created this account and posted what I did.

Feel free to email me via the contact link on the film’s website (www.midnightsonmovie.com) and I’ll be happy to send you a reply.

,kurnis7,2012-06-28T19:00Z,"@NoCoerce

NoCoerce, read this carefully and probably at least three times because it is obvious you have several mental conditions afflicting you.

You clearly feel the need to defend the extremely small size of your dick by attacking independent films and their creators.  If you had a cock the size of toothpick you would at least go after bigger corporations and the millions of dollars they put into anti-piracy... but I can see (or rather can't) that your penis is too small for that.

You would have my sympathy if only you didn't use the only bit of intelligence you were given to write the most retarded comments I've ever seen on thepiratebay.

may god have mercy on you asshole."
,jhclark,2012-06-28T20:27Z,"No fucking way...Matt Compton, you are the man. This is how this shit should work. There's no way to control sharing of content 100%, so take the free publicity and ride it! "

Really good quality, thank you."
,doggins46290,2012-06-30T19:46Z,i am now getting this movie and looking forward to watching it ! and i am 1 of the many people that can only share what i can get due to other people's hard work on all these torrent's ! also i  like to watch a perfect 10  movie but i will settle for a 9 or 8 if i really want to see it. why you ask ? cause they are FREE !!! and i expect to get what i pay for which is $0.00 !! and i think its a nice touch for a film producer to get on here and comment with the rest of us ! ( it may help them to make a better flick the next time ! ) its a give and  take world. so may as well go with the flow to a point and hope it helps make torrents easier to share and help movie makers understand what we as viewers want to see! and as the old saying goes -  IF YOU LIKE IT ! BUY IT ! unfortunately money is what makes the world go round.
,mushrox,2012-07-01T18:29Z,"To mcompton:  

I seriously doubt anyone will donate to you from on here. This is where people come to get information for free, without being charged the huge price tags that come on media today.  I for one will never pay for anything I can download.

Why?
Because information should be free.
We need to transform how you are paid for your services.  How that should be done, I have no idea.  Maybe donations is the best bet - I have no idea."
,snakeyes77,2012-07-02T02:30Z,"1:nocerce, you're a fucking moron.
2: it is the real Compton posting here, I emailed the site and he did reply.
3:if you liked the movie, pitch in a couple bucks, if you didn't, don't give anything. Simple, really.

I liked it, and I preordered one off amazon. Honestly, I hope this becomes a new distribution method. 26.95 was a little pricy, but I figured it was an Indy, and deserved a couple extra bux. "
,hmlgs,2012-07-03T07:48Z,I'm pretty sure this whole movie plot is a rip off of the twilight series.
,frm0027,2012-07-04T07:47Z,@NoCoerce your a dim wit! How old are you? Are you spoiled? Have you ever worked a day in your life? I don't understand why people feel so entitled? I feel grateful to be able to download movies and I spend my fair share in tickets and on software. Matt Compton isn't a part of the Hollywood machine pumping out flicks a dime a dozen and raking in millions. Even then there is nothing wrong with Hollywood making money. Would you go to work for someone only to have them give your paycheck to someone else? All he's doing is asking that you donate or buy his movie if you want. I didn't see him threatening to sue you. I'm pretty sure the day everything is free is the day movies become shit. I highly doubt there would have been a star wars had Lucas not made a profit. People have to eat. Who pays your bills? By your attitude most likely I will in the future when your on welfare bc your self righteous ass thinks everything should be free and if it ain't you'll just take it
,willytakum,2012-07-04T19:16Z,"Personally speaking, my hat is off to MCCompton for having the guts to come here and plead his case. He did not threaten or accuse...He simply asked for our help. If you can't/ don't want to donate or purchase then don't. But don't trash the guy for trying to make a buck...We all have to eat and that takes money..."
,vampzcore,2012-07-05T05:51Z,thanks!!
,petekirman,2012-07-07T04:38Z,"I downloaded. I paid. 
Kudos for posting Matt."
,ELU5IV3,2012-07-07T10:53Z,"I have always disagree'd with registering with any torrent site, but i HAVE to put in my 2 cents.  Any of you that think its our right to free media are completely ignorant to how our economy works, and i have to imagine that you haven't worked for more than a day in your life. If all media was free who would fund movies like The Avengers? How would actors get paid? If Music was free how would Eminem pay alimony? And continue to care about making music? Your ignorance only makes you look naive and it shows that you are unable to express your own opinions. Matt Compton is a good fuckin dude for doin what he's doin. This is something we should encourage, not frown upon. For those of you who actually are reasonable and logical; fucking applause. I'm going to donate money on general principal alone, and then if the movie is good enough, ill purchase it.

NoCoerce: ""Carpenters and plumbers never had such a protection when they found a new way of doing things.""

It's called a fuckin Patent you idiot, and on a different note, your logic is flawed and idiotic."
,TruBill,2012-07-07T13:16Z,"@nocoerce seriously, people like you shouldnt have the access to comment, let alone leech. as ""1dissident"" said... you seem to have a i take what i want and give nothing back attitude, and my friend.. that will get you no where in life. you're probably just another wanna-be hard ass hiding behind a computer screen. do not bash Matt Compton for trying to make a name for himself. people like you are the reason the phrase ""hater"" has become so popular because envy and jealousy has gone through the roof. all due to lazy bastards as yourself expecting the hand outs and not putting in a lick of effort.

on an immature note, im sure you still live in your mothers basement. kudo's kid."
,baldwheel,2012-07-08T08:19Z,"NoCoerce - ""If you don't like your work to be copyed, don't show it to anybody!""

Probably the dumbest comment that I have heard in my life. You Sir, are a fucking moron."
,erich555,2012-07-10T17:38Z,"All kinds of little tricks happening on this comment board. It's all meant to create the illusion that this is a ""real deal"" DVD rip when in fact it's just a blurry mess with terrible audio.Be advised."
,nzafghan,2012-07-10T18:35Z,"People like NoCoerce love the internet. It creates heroes out of people like them, able to tell whoever they want what they want, with no fear of physical consequences. Safe behind their monitors, the internet has created a whole race of cowards."
,mcompton,2012-07-11T00:20Z,"I just wanted to thank everyone for all of the nice comments and support.  To those of you who either purchased a DVD or donated to us via PayPal, a HUGE thank you goes out to you.  It’s great to see so many in this community showing their support in whatever ways they can.  It means a lot to me and the other filmmakers involved.  :)"
,lugzz,2012-07-11T05:05Z,@ mcompton we came here to get it free..if we wanted to buy your crap we would not be here..duuuh! so piss off and keep making movies for us to copy off the piratebay we hijack movies an love that we dont have to buy this shit tho some would but you aint getting a dime out of me haha..ps seed forever piratebay rules. ty for the ul scene4all..massive.
,lugzz,2012-07-11T05:09Z,movie is boring btw
,juicyfruit123,2012-07-11T09:20Z,"Whoever thinks information should be free is fucking retarded. Try producing something yourself while paying the bills simultaneously. It's not going to happen unless you make a godamn profit. 

I'll admit, I'm a selfish bastard myself, as I love TPB. But I'm not selfish enough to believe that the hours of work that went into a film should go unrewarded. Indie filmmakers already do so much free shit just to ""get the foot into the door.""

The film industry is a hard one to break into. Make a filmmaker's life a little easier and at least donate.

If you've ever tried to produce a work of art professionally, you'd understand."

,omgwtfnoob,2012-07-13T08:24Z,"if i didnt pirate, i still wouldnt pay to see them... i only pirate because i need to use up my bandwidth. i still pay to see a decent movie. in my opinion pirating is a way of encouraging film makers to create a decent film. LONG LIVE TPB!"
,village1diot,2012-07-13T13:16Z,"I feel for the people trying to break in. The blame should go on the people that make it difficult for anyone else, other than themselves, to produce new stuff. These are the same people that we pirates despise.

We have common enemies, so we pirates should do what we can to help these people make it."
,DRUNKSOB,2012-07-14T14:04Z,no shit? mat $%^& compton your the man thats awsome way to do business free for all who cant a ford it and ask for donations from those that can. It works great for open source software dont see why it wouldn't work just as well for movie makers. I got ten bucks left on my paypal and its yours man. 
,mils9876,2012-07-19T10:37Z,"elusive u muppet.  You provide the same logic for your retarded argument negating yourself.  Yea economies work that way but they also highlight competition and where change and adaptation are key especially in modern economies.  Hence the fact that we have to pay 18 + 3(3d) $ for a movie that at the end of it we end up walking out saying it was shit.  Bring down the prices of movies and people will buy them, take itunes for example artist when it first came out were pissed that their songs were only $1...10yrs on now they love itunes cause at least they get paid something instead of nothing.  Big ticket actors arent worth their 30million for a movie that is shit.  Pay them 1 mil and bring down the ticket price.  

And finally go have a shit your breath stinks"

,Rush,2012-07-20T08:08Z,"@ELU5IV3.... here's whats wrong with the MPAA IFAA gestapo's argument that for each copy pirated they lose the value of the copy, BULLSHIT..... and I can prove it

This only assumes that each and every pirated copy would have purchased legally if it wasn't available for free as a torrent

This is ridiculous on it's face I for one wouldn't have watched 80% or more of the movies I download if they weren't free. I wouldn't have paid a dime to watch most of this crap. Therefore they lost exactly ZERO dollars on those movies that I wouldn't have paid to see at a theater or rent otherwise.

 Sharing is exactly that, someone purchased the original and is now sharing it with friends or (peers) Why is this different than sharing a movie with your family, or neighbor, or at a party? Larger scale is the ONLY difference."

But movies on dvd is not crime if i have the dvd why not share with others...
Its mine i can do whatever i want with him...........
If i pay for him or not its my problem.

Nobody will not go to cinema because of this.....

The price of the tikets is very expensive

Ask any actor how many maney he wins for a movie,publicity and awards?

And you if you work how many money you win for 30 days of work,every year till you die....

They win in one movie what i need to work all my 2 our 3 lifes.....
