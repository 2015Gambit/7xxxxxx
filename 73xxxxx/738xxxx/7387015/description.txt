I'm still doing activation as well in case you missed out the first time around! 201 registered, 99 slots left! :)   (Should last throughout the rest of the month, if not longer)

***Note, you don't need to activate again if you're activated already for the first beta. That activation should last a year from when you did it.***

$5 via PayPal to RochesterCellular@gmail.com along with your UDID and I'll have you all set in minutes. You get your UDID from iTunes after plugging in your device and clicking on the serial number. It will change to the UDID which you can copy/paste to me.

Not a scammer!!! Feel free to email me beforehand to ease any fears/concerns, I won't bite! :)
