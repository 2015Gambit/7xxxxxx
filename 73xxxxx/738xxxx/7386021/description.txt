It is inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's story -   
Noshtonirh.Significantly different,it veers away  
from the confines of the period drama,and sets    
it in time contemporary,with its inherent         
complexities and moral chaos.Yet the fundamental  
structure of Tagore's classic narrative continues 
to present disturbing questions to the moral      
ambivalence facing the audience of today.         
                                                  
Chaiti,a lonely housewife ignored by an indi-     
fferent husband,discovers an alternative exis     
tence in the cyber world,whose secrecy allows     
her to relinquish her inhibitions on Facebook,    
where her alter ego Charulata 2011 emerges as     
a distinctly differnet character.Her id is now    
is her existence,her refuge from daily domestic   
melancholy.                                       
                                                  
The film examines the institution of marriage     
and conducts a ruthless post-mortem of infidelity.
