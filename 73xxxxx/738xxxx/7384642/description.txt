Ian Moore - Ian Moore (1993)


"Ian Moore" is the eponymous debut album by Ian Moore and was released in 1993 on the Capricorn label.  I looked all over the web for a high-quality rip of this hard to find disc.  I came up empty-handed and decided to search out the actual disc.  Finally found it in a local mom and pop music store.  Here it is for those of you who may be looking for it as well.  Enjoy.
