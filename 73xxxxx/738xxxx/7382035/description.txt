The Best Of Simple Minds is the 2nd greatest hits album by Simple Minds, released in 2001. New versions of the ΓÇÿTheme For Great CitiesΓÇÖ were released, & some copies (such as the U.S. version), included the remixes by Raven Maize.
A new edition was released in November 2007 with an extra DVD of the Verona concert film.
The SACD version of The Best Of was prepared from the remastered album. Therefore thereΓÇÖs little difference between the SACD mix & that of the remaster.
