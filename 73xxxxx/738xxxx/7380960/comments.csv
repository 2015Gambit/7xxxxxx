Windows 8 is quite different from all the other Windows OS's and needs practice in order to navigate and negotiate around it. Place it on a virtual machine (VMWare is a good one) and tinker around with it there."

Well, I was not familiar with Windows 8 but I've managed to install it on a separate partition on my notebook, and it dual boots with my Window 7 x64 without any issues. But if you do not want to risk anything, installing it on VMware is definitely a good idea."

Keep in mind as you're practicing a new OS that the user interface will be quite different on the final Windows 8 release in the Fall of 2012."
