Coast: Series 7 
COAST explores the edge of our lives, the coastline that marries us to the sea. It takes in the life of that coastline, the people who live there, the history played out upon it and the sea itself, a tempestuous and unpredictable bride that also brings food and comfort to those who visit its shores. Nick Crane is joined by a fascinated and fascinating team of expert presenters including Neil Oliver, Miranda Krestovnikoff, Mark Horton, Tessa Dunlop, Dick Strawbridge, Andy Torbet, Hermione Cockburn, Ian McMillan and Ruth Goodman as they discover the rich landscapes and lifestyles that appear along our shores
