Lacie Heart (born August 22, 1986) is an American pornographic actress

Heart grew up on a ranch in Templeton, California,[1] and studied ballet as a child.[2] She danced at a Canoga Park strip club's amateur night at age 19 on a whim.[2] While she was there she was recruited by and subsequently met with agent Derek Hay of L.A. Direct Models in August 2005.[3] Her first on-camera appearance was in a scene for Fantasy Wash with Jack Venice who had introduced her to the adult film business.[4] She signed with Vivid in January 2006[3] and was with them for nearly a year.[1]

Heart was introduced to fellow performer Scott Nails at a party about a month after she had entered the business.[4] They became a couple soon after. Heart left Vivid after she told them that the only guy she wished to work with on camera was Nails; Vivid already had one actress who did only girl-girl, and they did not care to have Heart signed to work exclusively with one guy.[1] In December 2006, Lacie signed with Digital Playground.[5]

As of June 2007, Heart lives in Arizona and commutes to Los Angeles to film.[1]
