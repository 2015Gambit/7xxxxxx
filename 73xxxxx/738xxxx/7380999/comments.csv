,hitman_xp,2012-07-09T23:56Z,"DLC.Pack.v2.multi9 has error of not working dlc ""batcave"" (ChallengeMap57F)
Install DLC v3 at step 2 instead v2.

If you installed v3 after step 5 you need to repeat steps 3-5."

,cosminbh,2012-07-16T16:00Z,"my guesss is that is some sort of antipiracy system since HQR barely appeared in the US on 29th of May
Better i wait till 6th/7th of september for the official GOTY PC Edition.
Anyway thx for you effort."
