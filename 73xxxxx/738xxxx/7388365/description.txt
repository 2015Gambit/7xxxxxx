The Newsroom 1x1
"We Just Decided To"
Airdate: Sunday June 24th, 2012

From the mind of Aaron Sorkin, creator of The West Wing and screenwriter of
The Social Network and Moneyball,  comes The Newsroom,  a behind-the-scenes
look at the people who make a nightly cable-news program. Focusing on a
network anchor (played by Jeff Daniels), his new executive producer (Emily
Mortimer), the newsroom staff (John Gallagher, Jr., Alison Pill, Thomas
Sadoski, Olivia Munn, Dev Patel) and their boss (Sam Waterston), the series
tracks their quixotic mission to do the news well in the face of corporate
and commercial obstacles-not to mention their own personal entanglements.

In the premiere of this drama set at a cable-news network, popular "News Night"
anchor Will McAvoy returns to work after a public meltdown to find most of his
staff has jumped ship, but new hires help steer the show when news of a
catastrophe breaks in the spring of 2010.
