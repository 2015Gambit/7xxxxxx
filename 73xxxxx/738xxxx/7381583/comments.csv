Dumb, Drunk & Racist  (the Australians?)


I watched these two episodes, they are entertaining and good image quality, but on the other hand they left me very angry because to make some money they side-stepped the issues and wasted everybody's time. Perhaps this is not the best place to say this, but here I assure the widest possible audience for my views, which I think are reasonable and would solve the problem for good (perhaps there and elsewhere as well).

First of all, the original European australians built over the years a prosperous society and people from all over the world want to immigrate and enjoy the benefits.
As long as they were from european or south or north american origin, after the incidents that always happen in the beginning, they soon blended with the locals
and their children became australians, a growth in population the country needs for a number of reasons.

But when people from radically different religion and customs immigrate, they call their 'freedom' the crazy aspiration of IMPOSING on the locals tolerance to alien dress codes (burkas, for example) which are a security risk, not only for terrorism but for all kinds of organized crime. If a local decided to walk in the streets like that, they would surely be stopped by the police for suspicious behavior.

Although they deny it for being too few, the shift in population makes it almost certain that as they become the majority, orthodox muslims would pass laws to force the local australians to respect and even obey (on morality grounds) their foreign beliefs and customs. I am sure many of the so called 'racist' aussies just want to defend the right to live in the country they built comfortably, without having to accept foreign imposed customs. Dressing themselves like that, many muslims provoke retaliation, although I condemn any form of violence..

Sikhs, for example, must carry knives (daggers) on their bodies as one of the teachings of their Guru Nanak, and complain loudly when such a dangerous custom is objected for the obvious reason. In Canada a few years ago big street battles with knives and sticks took place between rival temples, with injured and dead victims, should we tolerate that because of a guru's teachings?

The best solution is for the government to say very clearly (pass laws to that effect):
wherever people come to live in australia, they must agree in writing to accept the country's dress and other basic codes. In their own homes and churches, they can dress and believe and worship as they want, but in public they must conform to the majority ways which are quite elastic, they can cover themselves with long sleeve shirts and long pants or skirts, etc, no offense to anybody. If they lie and provoke, they are warned first and then if repeated, deported back to their own or other countries.

Besides in the show the Indians LIED saying there is no ethnic violence in India, we all know from the partition to nowadays the violent anti-muslim or anti hindu riots, and bombs, so they can teach aussies nothing...

And finally, the muslim often declared intention to 'convert', one way or another, the whole world to their customs and beliefs, show the conscious or unconscious long term intention behind all their deceiving protests.

Sorry, but think about it and you might come to agree with me"
