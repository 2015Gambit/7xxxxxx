Pretenders II is the second studio album by the British rock band The Pretenders.
The success of the PretendersΓÇÖ debut album in 1980 created a great demand for more material from the fledgling band; however, a lack of songs precluded the quick release of a followup album. In the United Kingdom, the band released two hit singles in 1980 and early 1981, ΓÇ£Message of LoveΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£Talk of the Town.ΓÇ¥ In the US, where standalone singles had become rare, these tracks were combined with three others for a stopgap EP release called Extended Play, in March 1981. Their second album, Pretenders II, was released a scant two months later, to mixed critical reception, partly because two of the better songs on the album had been previously released, and partly because many of the songs were viewed as overly-similar (though not quite as groundbreaking) to the bandΓÇÖs debut. Nevertheless, several of the albumΓÇÖs songs became hits and the album has increased in critical stature with time.
