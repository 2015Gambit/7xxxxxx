The Best Chameleon Helper 

Champlist
Champlist is standalone app for managing Chameleon bootloader. It's definitely the best-looking app on this list: the developers have clearly given the user interface first priority. When you first open Champlist, it presents a thin gray bar with a set of tabs for updating Chameleon, configuring Chameleon's settings, editing your SMBios, installing kexts, and switching bootscreen themes.

Chameleon Preference Pane
We've mentioned Chameleon Preference Pane before, but its name is already self-explanatory: it's a preference pane for Chameleon, which you can add to the Mac OS X System Preferences app. Chameleon Prefpane is an official project by the Voodoo Dev Team, the developer of Chameleon bootloader.
