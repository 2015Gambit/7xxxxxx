,LordTruce,2012-06-25T03:03Z,"...Then why did you label it with English spoken Language in the Info, as well as English Audio in the Description?  Atleast it saves me the time of downloading it..."
,LordTruce,2012-06-25T03:04Z,"Why the English Language label, then?"
[V],scene4all,2012-06-25T03:17Z,"Its a mistake, shit happens. If i could edit the description i would, but i cant."

thank you scene4all for all you efforts, I've downloaded many a time your torrents and your work is appreciated. Keep up the outstanding work!  

Props to the Russians for always getting US the Goods.

The rest of you bitches should read the initial comment ""Russian Audio"", watch it anyways because I'm sure the script isn't what drew your attention, you illiterate fucks.   "
[V],YIFY,2012-06-25T05:13Z,fail.
,33rdHand,2012-06-25T05:54Z,"Dude, seriously why the fuck would you label something ENGLISH when it's not.  3 hours to download wasted.  "
,33rdHand,2012-06-25T05:57Z,"OK. I read the comments.  You've downloaded enough legit shit to deserve a pass or two, even three. Shit happens."

,xXTheGoonXx,2012-06-25T13:10Z,Can you bother with the original spoken language like it's supposed to be? Or is this going to happen to every fucking movie this year?

,NOKES,2012-07-18T07:17Z,"Its too bad these friggin idiots are so lazy or they might have spent 5 seconds to read the comments prior to spending hours downloading this flick & made sure they were getting what they wanted like the rest of us are doing now. Instead these duche bags impatiently rip through TPB expecting to not have to put forth any effort while getting a perfect world handed to them for free without a please or thank you. I personally never download anything without reading people's comments first, it's probably why I don't have to sit here and cry about wasting a couple hours downloading the wrong torrent. But then even if I did download the wrong one who really cares anyways, IT'S FUKING FREE YOU UNGREATFUL PANTY WASTES!
I think more people should intentionally post wrong descriptions until these people learn to put forth a little effort and accept some responcibilty for what happens to them in life and learn to appreciate what people do to make their lives easier by supplying them with free shit like these torrents. FYI these posters don't owe you ungreatful fucks anything, your in his house now and you can eat whats being served here with a smile on your face or get the fuck out and go buy a movie ticket you cheap pricks. Hey Scene dont sweat this little mistake you post mad high quality torrents and we really appreciate the work you put into bringing these flick to us. Unfortunately most of the cool people who do appreciate you are also the one in a hurry and dont take the time to leave comments giving you the praise you deserve. For some reason the duche bags though always seem to make the time to complain endlessly and blame others for what is more often then not their fault and something they were in complete control to either rectify or keep from going wrong from the start. I say ""Let'm eat crow!!!"""
