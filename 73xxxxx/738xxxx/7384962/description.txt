Kirsty Wark presents live coverage of a special outdoor concert by the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra conducted by the charismatic Gustavo Dudamel, performed in Raploch in Stirling and marking the start of the London 2012 Festival. The concert, staged in the shadow of Stirling Castle, also celebrates the work of the community-based music programme Sistema Scotland and features a performance from some of the local children who are part of this project. The Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra play Beethoven's 3rd Symphony with pieces by Ginastera, Bernstein, etc. and a very special finale, so expect fireworks on and off stage from one of the most exciting orchestras and conductors in the world.
