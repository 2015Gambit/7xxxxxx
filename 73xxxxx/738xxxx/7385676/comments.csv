Q: When activating more than one, it gives me a popup, to choose ""Yes, Upgrade"" or ""No, Activate Normally"". Which do I choose?
A: Choose ""No, Activate Normally"", for each one.

Q: I am presented with an option asking me whether I want to overwrite files. Why and what do I choose?
A: You got this dialog box because you installed another mod which modified the same files. My suggestion is to simply choose the ""No To All"" option."
