Lacie Heart was introduced to fellow performer Scott Nails at a party about a month after she had entered the business.[4] They became a couple soon after. Heart left Vivid after she told them that the only guy she wished to work with on camera was Nails; Vivid already had one actress who did only girl-girl, and they did not care to have Heart signed to work exclusively with one guy.[1] In December 2006, Lacie signed with Digital Playground.[5]

As of June 2007, Heart lives in Arizona and commutes to Los Angeles to film.
