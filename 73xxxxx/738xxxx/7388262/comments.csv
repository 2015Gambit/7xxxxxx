Once upon a time, there was a dude with a phone on his knee. One day, the phone rang and the knee of the dude began to vibrate.
""Hello"" answered the dude.
The dude heard a raspy ""Hello"", in response, on his phone on his knee.
It was a voice he hadn't heard in ages, but one that he recognized as a Mother would a picture of her own child.
In the split-second it took the dude to convert his reaction from thought, into communication, he was interrupted by the raspy voice on his phone on his knee.

^I'm not sure why I started writing that. ^ Or where it's going.
Sometimes ideas just pop into my head. This one popped while I was here D/L'ing this torrent. I'll have to copy/paste & finish it later. In the meantime- Enjoy

Or better yet.... Continue the story in ur own comment, it'll be a community story!!!"

""But if you're my knee, who was phone?"" said John
and then john was a zombie"
