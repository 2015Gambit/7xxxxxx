Plot: The sudden appearance of an enormous flying saucer over the Spanish capital of Madrid causes a plethora of problems for four people cooped up in a small urban apartment in this dark comedy-drama from director Nacho Vigalondo (Timecrimes). The sunlight shining through the windows but the streets eerily silent, Julio (Julián Villagrán) and Julia (Michelle Jenner) are attempting to navigate the awkward aftermath of a drunken one-night stand when they notice a massive U.F.O. hovering ominously over the city. It seems that all of the tenants in the building have vanished without a trace, along with most of the people in the city save for Julia’s portly, prying neighbor Ángel (Carlos Areces). Later, when Julia’s boyfriend Carlos (Raul Cimas) shows up, an awkward game of deception emerges as Julia and Julio attempt to keep their fling a secret. But when Ángel catches wind of the affair, the dynamics in the apartment begin to shift. Desperate, Julia and Julio hatch a plan to get Ángel out of the picture, and ensure that Carlos remains none the wiser. Unfortunately for the conniving couple, that’s easier said than done and before long human conflict begins to take precedence over the strange events unfolding outside.
