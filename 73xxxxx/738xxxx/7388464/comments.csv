Also in configuration screen the confirm button is off limit so you cant get out of it (tab, enter nor esc doesnt work). This happens with all screen resolutions."

Sorry for the wait, I rarely check up on my uploaded torrents.

No idea how I could help you fix that problem, my monitor auto-adapts to resolutions.

Though I think Afterlight has a 'windowed' mode, which you should be able to put it in and it might aid you in fixing the resolution. Making it a psuedo-fullscreen. (using the window to fill-out your monitor but not truly fullscreen)

Otherwise I'd have to say go to UFO Afterlight's official website, it's forums and state or search your problem there. Someone could better help you or already have found a solution to your problem."
