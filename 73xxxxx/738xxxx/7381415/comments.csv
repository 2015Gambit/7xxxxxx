,MVC78,2012-06-24T05:37Z,"KEVIN SMITH!? I love him. This is going to be great stuff, hopefully as good as Clerks and Mallrats and Dogma. This is a wonderful surprise, I had no idea he had a new movie out. 

ALL HAIL KEVIN SMITH'S BINDLESTIFFS

I already know it's a 10/10/10, so excited to hear some great rapier wit in Kevin Smith's dialogue here, watching now, go Kevin Smith! "
,chamorrow,2012-06-24T10:35Z,"MVC78 , r u kevin smith?"
,Yaboo56,2012-06-24T11:59Z,"Kevin Smith backed it, that's good enough for me !"
,ahoi1,2012-06-24T17:29Z,Kevin Smith has nothing to do with this movie. The production company is just using his name...
,MVC78,2012-06-24T23:27Z,"Kevin Smith, Kevin Smith, Kevin Smith, Kevin Smith's BINDLESTIFFS is here! 

Downloading now, I love Clerks and Mallrats and Dogma and Chasing Amy. I can't tell who stars in this from the DVD cover though, there faces are blocked. But I'm pretty sure I see Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Jason Mewes, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Lee and Brad Pitt in the fine print below though

This is shaping up to be Kevin Smith's BEST movie yet. And I hadn't even seen one commercial for it, it's like discovering a diamond  amongst a gigantic mountain of cubic zirconias! 

KEVIN SMITH MARRY ME, FOR I AM ABOUT TO BE SEDUCED INTO YOUR OMNIPOTENT THRAW BY YOUR GREATEST MASTERPIECE YET - KEVIN SMITH'S BINDLESTIFFS"
