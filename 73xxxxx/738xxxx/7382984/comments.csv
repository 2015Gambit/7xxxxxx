,T.F.K,2012-06-24T23:42Z,This fix is for users having problems getting the game to start cause of admin rights on windows.Not for bag fixing!
,Ravenduz,2012-06-25T08:16Z,"Hi TFK, any fix for the ""device is hung.."" error, it's really annoying..the game keeps crashing/freezing..only happens on cracked copies!"
