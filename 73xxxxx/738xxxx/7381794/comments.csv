,wetWeasel,2012-06-24T10:06Z,"Another outstanding torrent with a detailed description that is worthy of a noble prize for literature. A ripping 78 megs of files (Assuming Jpeg, but could be GIF, TIFF, BMP who knows) and so many great images that the poster couldn't decide which one to post as a sample/preview.
I will wait with baited breath while this downloads. Will I be surprised or disappointed? are these professional photos, amateur shots? Cartoon drawings of Tom and Jerry buggering each other? candid hidden cams of someones sister? Maybe it's a collection of car pictures posted in the wrong section. "
