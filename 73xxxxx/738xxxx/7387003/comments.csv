,Fritz.,2012-06-27T21:48Z,"depends on the type of movie it is. if its something like a romantic comedy or that type of film then it doesnt really matter that much if its a bit blurry as long as the audio is decent, you still get the jokes and whatnot.

other movies like this one are special effects driven are dependent on being able to see all the cool stuff happening on the screen. watching them in poor video quality just ruins the whole movie experience to me.

each to their own though. i am a pretty busy guy and dont have a lot of time to waste, so i may be more critical of things than your average basement dwelling stoner who has nothing better to do with his life and has no aspirations to ever get beyond the average functioning 8th grade education level of the masses..."

The picture was blurry, and the voices were the same. 10 minutes in, and I hadn't understood a single word that was said. Had to turn it off. And I am certainly not basing it on hatred of cams, it's just that this is the worst of the worst.

 but if it justifies invasion then go for it right.. 
 shit hole country means that obviously you have never been to canada  .. bigger that the usa         ( fact )and less people ( fact) that are way smarter ( fact ) and much safer ( also a fact ).. hmmmm i can see how that is shit .. oh and if you want to get all smarty pants .. look up the gulf of tomken incident . then remove egg from your face silly boy.

,Fritz.,2012-07-12T18:57Z,"saying canada is larger with less people are facts is correct...

however trying to claim its safer there with more intelligent people are dubious statements at best.

the best you could do to justify those facts is try to use broad based comparisons while completely ignoring the facts that every person is an individual with his or her own intelligence level. A persons IQ could be off the charts, but if you lumped them in with a bunch of dim wits the average would become low. That however is not a proper reflection of the single person with a high IQ.

also if you really wanted to break down your ""safer"" comment you would need to include other factors such as its a known fact that the more densely populated an area becomes the higher the crime rates become, and if you actually compared equally populated areas against each other you would see similar crime rates.

at best you have a tenuous hold on the information you are spouting and have a precarious position to defend. I would not envy the position you have placed yourself in."
,igl00EH,2012-07-12T21:06Z,"LMAO @ george, i would love to see that happen lol. 

However Fritz is correct about the ""safer"" and ""IQ"" comments. There is more crime in the US than Canada because of the higher population (and probably because most americans own a firearm) and there is no real significant way to tell if one country has a more intelligent population than the other. That being said, can't we all just get along lol.

as far as individuals go though, i dont really care where you are from, what you look like, what your sexual preference is, or anything else. If you are nice to me then i will be nice to you. Thats it.

,Nighlock,2012-08-12T22:27Z,"Photonman123, Canadians didn't have small parts in either of the wars that were mentioned, we had large parts, since at the time of both we were a british colony and were called into the war by England, in 1812 with the majority of the fighting force being people living in the Colony of Canada at the time and most of their decendents do still live here and we tend to think of it as a victory on Canada's part. As for WWII we had no small part in it either since it was Canadians that took vital places that changed the outcome of the war that no other army could take after countless attempts. So if that is stupid for helping save Europe with the worlds fourth-largest air force and third-largest naval surface fleet, then cheers to small parts. :)"
