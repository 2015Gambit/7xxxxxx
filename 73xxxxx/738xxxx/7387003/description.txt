WORKDONE:

OK took the poo russian camrip,rotated slightly,pulled some sides out,resized and
then filtered the video and then hey presto .....still POO lmfao
Anyway only reason for doing this is because there is nothing else going on and
SOMEONE might want it lol Audio we had too clean and sync ....had to shrink the
audio as it was 5mins runtime difference then it was dam close.Just needed
stretching back a little and now its 99.9% in sync Video was missing 2 secs
only ....and the sync is pretty much bang on nbut due too the darkness in nsome
parts and some auto focus issues is was a tad hard in parts and had to reply on
sounds from doors shutting etc...too line it up

Anyway ....you've been warned...this copy is pretty poo around
IMHO V4 A4
