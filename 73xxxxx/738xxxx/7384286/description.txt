Lt. John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. 
He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is not alone, 
but meets a wolf he dubs "Two-socks" and a curious Indian tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, 
and discovers a white woman who was raised by the Indians. He gradually earns the respect of these native people, 
and sheds his white-man's ways.
