,analrod1,2012-06-23T22:17Z,Is there any way I can download just episode 11 and 12?
,IVIoogle,2012-06-23T22:22Z,"Seeing if it's good quality too, I'll post back after I'm done downloading. This was fairly quick, especially since season finale just came out. "
,IVIoogle,2012-06-23T22:23Z,@analrod1 So far I think there's just tv quality ones out. Here's the one I got: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7380125/The.Legend.of.Korra.S01E11-E12.Skeletons.in.the.Closet.Endgame.T

Yes, there is. Just click get this torrent, and then when it starts downloading check your torrent client (uTorrent for me) and select this torrent. At the bottom their should be a tab that says ""Files."" Click on that tab and then just select everything you don't want downloaded. Right click and select ""Don't Download."""

,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-28T23:01Z,"This is the one to get.  Every file plays right through, even on my phone (Android, Evo, 2.1 Froyo rollback using RockPlayer or Estrongs).  VLC and Media Player Classic both had no trouble with these.

Quality looks impeccable so far (checked beginning and end of every episode and middle for Sync), liking the show and animation too.

Nice upload FaMoUz, thanks again!"

,Piper_McJagger,2012-07-13T00:24Z,"Audio: 10
Video: 10

This is some good shit, guys! Thank you so much, FaMoUz!"
,kubrick,2012-07-21T14:52Z,"Episodes 1-9 are great, but episode 10 has an unnecessary low quality intro from before the episode's beginning (otherwise the episode is okay) and episode 11+12 has very bad video and audio quality."
,inoth79,2012-08-10T16:39Z,Thank you mate ! I will seed 
,1nv1d1ous,2012-08-23T11:13Z,"Great up until the finale, which seems to drop off in quality. I recommend downloading this along with it.

,Monk-eye,2012-09-08T18:47Z,Thanks! Had so much trouble getting a reliable source for this during the run which left me with files of varying quality.
