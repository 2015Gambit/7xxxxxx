,yorkman,2012-06-28T22:15Z,"My W7 x64 gets activated but soon after it goes back to trial. Last time it showed only 11 days left. I don't want to run out and get locked out.

Either this isn't working or I'm doing something wrong. More like this doesn't work."
,undermaker,2012-06-29T00:22Z,why need WAT fix?  i always use only loaderand everything woks fine....do i still need WAT fix ???
,extracube,2012-06-29T22:22Z,"@yorkman, are you often doing ""windows updates"" or making other big changes to your system?  Reason I ask is because that happens to me too if I do it.

Yes, I also would like to know why we would even need to run WAT fix (i.e. uninstall RemoveWAT or HAL7600).  If they aren't broken, why fix?"
