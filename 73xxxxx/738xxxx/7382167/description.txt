On the stage, George Benson made his debut as a singer. His first single, She Makes Me Mad, he recorded when he was 10 years old. A few years later formed his own prodigy black vocal group, who performed rhythm and blues. Around the same time he became interested in playing the guitar and was soon one of the first jazz musicians of that time began to sing snippets of their songs in unison with his guitar. In 1962-1965 years he played in a quartet Jack McDuff. Within a few years, as efforts of the young George to capture the "second profession" were appreciated not only by the public at the concerts, but the Giants record industry - in the mid-sixties with him signed the famous company A & M, which released one after another, just three his plate.
