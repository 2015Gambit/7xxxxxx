Last Chance to See -- Original Radio Programmes
===============================================
This is the original radio programmes, as aired by BBC Radio 4 in 1989 (with
the additional "Natural Selection: In Search of the Aye-Aye" pilot, which was
aired in 1985 and started it all).

The series follow Douglas Adams and Mark Cawardine around the world as they
visit (and try to catch a glipse of) endangered species. A follow-up television
series was made 20 years later (in 2009) with Stephen Fry and Mark Cawardine,
but this is the original radio programmes that started it all. The series is
narrated by Peter Jones ("the book" from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).

In 2001 the series was broadcast in Australia on ABC Radio National where the
episodes where given somewhat fancier names. I've included the Australian names
here as well for reference.

The mountain gorilla and the northern white rhino were also visited by Douglas
and Mark but, sadly, did not make it into the radio series.

These episodes are available from the BBC web site if you live in the UK, but
not elsewhere in the world -- I got the episodes by using a VPN service to
obtain a UK IP address. The episodes where then recorded by tapping into the
system sound while listening to them in the browser (not very fancy, I know).
The sound quality seems (to my ears) to be okay though, and since I went
through so much trouble to be able to listen to the show I should I might as
well share. :)
