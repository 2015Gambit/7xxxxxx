Had to transfer the unpacked file com.rockstar.maxpayne wich comes from unpacking into the android device into: Android/data just like you should have other folders nmed com,andoird. yada yada.
Also transfer the *.apk* file into your android, like into gameloft or something, doesnt matter where.
Activate the *.apk* and then it should run by downloading instantly ( because its there already) the remaining about 2 Gb.
Enjoy.
Thanks a lot for sharing."
