This fully updated version of the original 1989 edition of the World Encyclopedia of Police Forces and Correctional Systems describes the national law enforcement and correctional systems of approximately 220 countries around the world.

Providing both statistical and analytical information, the Encyclopedia features scholarly analysis by qualified authorities about law enforcement organizations in a user-friendly, alphabetical arrangement. Articles about law enforcement in specific countries are accompanied by historical and thematic overviews -- including discussions about ethics; conduct; prison history and juvenile crime -- that provide further context and ideas for study.
