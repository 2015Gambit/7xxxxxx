Considered one of the most violent television series of its era, "Mannix" followed the adventures of L.A. private eye Joe Mannix, who first worked for a detective agency known as Intertect, which relied heavily on computers and a large network of operatives. In the second season, Mannix opened his own agency, with police widow Peggy Fair working for him as his secretary. Each episode featured plenty of fistfights, car chases and shootouts.
