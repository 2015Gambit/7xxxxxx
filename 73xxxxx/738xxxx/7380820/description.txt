The gameplay in Tokimeki Memorial focuses on scheduling, dating and stat-building. The player must organize his or her time between asking out members of the opposite sex and developing his or her abilities at school and sport (with the long-term goal of becoming more seductive, not out of any intrinsic value). Dates are frequent but very brief, with usually only one multiple-choice question to determine whether your partner's love meter will increase or decrease. One playthrough lasts for a fixed period of three years of high school (on the order of 5ΓÇô10 hours of play), at the end of which the character with the highest love meter confesses their love.
