From Wikipedia:
"Notable sketches

The notable features of this show are the "Car Salesman" sketch, Cleese's definition of a 'Pepperpot,' and Chapman's "Airline Pilots" sketch.
Job Interview

The "Job Interview" sketch, starring Cleese as the interviewer and Brooke-Taylor as the interviewee, was later performed, almost unchanged, in the first season of Monty Python's Flying Circus with Chapman as the interviewee. The "pepperpots" also recurred in many Monty Python sketches, and the "Freedom of Speech" segment was lifted from At Last the 1948 Show.
Car Salesman

The "Car Salesman" sketch, in which Palin refuses to accept customer Chapman's claim that a car he sold is faulty, later inspired Python's Dead Parrot sketch in which the malfunctioning car is replaced by an expired parrot, Cleese plays the customer, and Palin plays the salesman.
Quiz Show

The "Quiz Show" sketch, where Brooke-Taylor, as a Pepperpot, annoys Cleese, a quiz show host, while appearing as a contestant on a show, was later adapted into another Monty Python sketch, where Terry Jones plays the contestant attempting to win the prize of a "blow on the head."
Airline Pilots

The "Airline Pilots" sketch is set in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, with Cleese (as captain) and Chapman (as copilot). The airliner is on autopilot. Bored, they start making reassuring intercom messages to the passengers telling them there is nothing to worry about ΓÇô at which point, of course, the passengers get worried ΓÇô aided by the flight attendant (Palin). These messages get continually more incomprehensible or mutually contradictory until eventually all the passengers bail out."
