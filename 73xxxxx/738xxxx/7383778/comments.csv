When the opening begins, it skips to a few seconds after and then it shots down the player. Please, check if it's well encoded.

I don't recommend to people to download this. But the episode 12 is fine, no problem ;)"

I believe you're download was only incomplete, or your players' codecs are not updated. I had played this video over different players and there were no problems. Just clean, high-def goodness from the amazing despo1ler.
