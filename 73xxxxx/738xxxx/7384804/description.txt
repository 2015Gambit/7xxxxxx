The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

Today on this LIVE Sunday edition, Alex Jones takes your calls and covers breaking news, including the latest case of mutating GMO crops where Tifton 85 grass 'suddenly mutated', according to reports, and killed dozens of cattle in the Central Texas area by somehow producing cyanide gas. This bizarre and tragic case is only part of the larger GMO attack -- a covert bio-weapon that has been unleashed upon the earth to infiltrate the entire food chain, kill off billions, wreck havoc on natural species and enable the takeover of life by a few. 

Alex also covers the latest in geo-political news, including the Muslim Brotherhood's rise to power in Egypt, the tensions leading towards war in Syria, the rapidly escalating use of drones on the homefront and more.
