,ZankmanJack,2012-07-03T19:49Z,"Can't get the game to work.
It starts for a second, opens one of them DOS Windows (sorry for the simplistic explanation) and one main window, but nothing is on it.
After this, the game crashes (""Program has stopped working, needs to close"")

Error report says something along the lines of ""APPDATA"". 
Anyone know anything?"
,LeimBR,2012-07-07T03:37Z,"''Write directory path contains unicode characters, which Overgrowth might not handle correctly yet''

I'm receiving this error everytime I go play the game. Anybody know what that means?"
,Froztiez,2012-07-08T02:20Z,"I'm so glad I found this game, thank you mate! I think 29$ is a bit to much for an alpha game with a release ETA in about 1-2 years."
,doubledog26,2012-07-08T03:49Z,all i got was an icon of a paper and i cant even open it.. where do or how do i get the full game where i can play? and i'm on a laptop too maybe that's the problem?
,Fredioz,2012-07-09T14:13Z,"Guys just use this URL to get all the latest updates, for some reason it won't let me get the new 185 alpha, must be a temporary bug, you just got to replace the numbers next to the a (e.g a170->a185) to get latest alpha. You can't jump alphas, therefore if you have this version you need to download alpha 184 first and then a185. Hope it helps!

,Fredioz,2012-07-10T11:57Z,"Also, Dwarth, the code i gave gives an error each time i downloade the new alpha 185, did they update the script like they said and now only members can download? That's a shame! Anyway keep updating alphas with the same regularity, altough you should get the new one, they made quite the improvements!"
,VitorCz,2012-07-16T18:57Z,where is the Alpha 185 and 186?
,light987,2012-07-23T05:07Z,"I agree with banme7899, please upload 186 since downloading the differences doesn't work anymore. Thanks in advance :)"
,kosmoz1,2012-07-23T11:26Z,Alpha 187 is qut.
,Dr.D.,2012-07-27T11:03Z,"To get Alpha 184 just follow this link (doesn't work with the newer ones for some reason, maybe it will work in a few days):

,Frogh,2012-07-28T02:04Z,"Could you possibly upload Overgrowth alpha 186? I'm pretty sure it's the newest one. Thanks, if you can!"
,Syco2,2012-08-06T04:27Z,"great work dwarth, any chance of alpha 188, that one has alot of new changes."
,xXxSildurxXx,2012-08-06T16:42Z,"you cant download the new version because its an another link now here it is cdn.wolfire.com/alpha/diffs/overgrowth-a188.zip
you may need to download overgrowth-a185 186 187 too"
,Swordchan,2012-08-11T00:45Z," Hello, when i try to download and install the new updates.. 185 186 etc.. It say's *The program can't start because nvtt.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.* Some1 help? :P"
,Swordchan,2012-08-11T00:52Z,I'm getting this error when i try to update with any of the following updates   185  186 etc.. *can't start up because of missing file nvtt.dll is missing*
,Fredioz,2012-08-16T21:41Z,Sounds like you jumped a couple of alphas there. Be sure you've always updated one version after another!
,Fredioz,2012-08-16T21:42Z,and yea for the alphas above 185 use this code http://cdn.wolfire.com/alpha/diffs/overgrowth-a190.zip and replace the 190 with he alpha you desire!
