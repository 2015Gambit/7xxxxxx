Hey guys, so the reason I am uploading this is because it is a fantastic album that needs to be heard, unfortunately it is not being produced anymore. I do not condone illegal file sharing  but in this case, this is the only way to make the album available to everyone. If you download this file I only ask that you go over to iTunes or Amazon and actually buy one or two of Dave Holland's albums in order to compensate for downloading this one free of cost. Thank you.
