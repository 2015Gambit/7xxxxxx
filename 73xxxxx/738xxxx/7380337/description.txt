Take to the skies for a bird's-eye view of how this vast and complex country actually works. Stunning aerial footage, high-definition video and real-time satellite data reveal the American landscape as you've never seen it before, and host Yul Kwon climbs, leaps, and rides across the US to find out what makes this nation tick .. He traces the mighty infrastructures that miraculously come together to manufacture goods, transport people, grow our food, and power our increasingly tech-dependent nation. From the glaciers of Alaska to the crowded New York subways; from Chicago's bustling freight yards to the lonely badlands of Wyoming, Yul takes us to spectacular and unexpected places and introduces us to the people whose effort and expertise puts food on our tables, keeps our lights on, our transport systems moving and our factories busy. This is a celebration of a nation in the 21st century. This is AMERICA REVEALED.
