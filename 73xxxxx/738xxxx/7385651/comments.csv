,bigboxes1,2012-09-18T19:40Z,Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich is a fake.
,bigboxes1,2012-09-19T01:23Z,"The Enforcer & First Strike are albums from the German band Warrant, not the American band.  This was a poorly put together discography.  It's like you downloaded anything you could get your hands on and then repackaged it as your own.  You didn't even check the accuracy of the files.  Boo."
