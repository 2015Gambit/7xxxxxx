Interpersonal Communication- The Whole Story[Team Nanban]tmrg

Kory Floyd | 2008 | 544 Pages | ISBN: 0073406643 | PDF | 36 MB

DESCRIPTION:

Drawing upon his own highly contemporary research on affection in relationships, and on the interplay of communication, physiology, and health, Kory Floyd has crafted a down-to-earth, 21st Century perspective on the complex and nuanced enterprise that is interpersonal communication. 
To reflect the experiences and expectations of todayΓÇÖs multidimensional student population, Interpersonal Communication: The Whole Story addresses a broader range of interpersonal communication contexts than any other book of its kind--by incorporating ΓÇ£dark sideΓÇ¥ IPC throughout the text and by including deeply diverse populations in its research-based and everyday examples. 
Floyd describes this as telling ΓÇ£The Whole Story,ΓÇ¥ (if not a more accurate one) rather than telling just the part that relates to mainstream populations. Throughout the text, Floyd encourages students to go beyond their ΓÇ£intuitiveΓÇ¥ notions about interpersonal communication, and helps them see the value in investigating relational processes systematically.
