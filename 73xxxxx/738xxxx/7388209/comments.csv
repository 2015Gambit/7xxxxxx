,cliff69,2012-07-03T05:19Z,I have no clue what this means.  Are there 11 different subtitles on the screen at all times?  Can I turn em off???  I'm looking for NO subs but don't know if this is it.

Of course there are 11 subs on the screen at the same time, plus another 14, not mention here, incl. blind script, and you can't turn them off...."
