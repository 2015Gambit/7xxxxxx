Bor, Serbia, once the largest copper mine, now just the biggest hole in Europe. Small union protests are going on. Toda and Stefan are the best friends, skaters, who spend their first summer after finishing high school. StefanΓÇÖs going to Belgrade to the University in fall. Toda says he wouldnΓÇÖt apply to the University even if he had the money. They spend time shooting ΓÇ£Jackass-likeΓÇ¥ videos and hanging out with Dunja, who came back from France for her holidays, and get into a quiet battle for her attention. In that strange relationship of dying friendship and rivalry they try to get ahead of each other. But when the small union protest evolves into a huge riot their destructiveness will tie them together once again.
