Something free is AS IS. Guys crying it's not perfect, it's not HD. Come on  guys. It's free
say thanks, give the A/V but don't complain it's not
good at all. It cost nothing remember that."
,Fritz.,2012-06-28T08:51Z,"i would rather some post that its bad quality than just act like it doesnt matter because its free.

i do not enjoy wasting my time and bandwidth on poor quality cams, and just because its a cam does not mean its going to be poor quality, some cams are very good.

usually when the ""its free"" defenders start posting comments you can just assume the quality is complete garbage and dont bother to waste your time.


@feed1back if you are going to insult an entire countries intelligence you might want to make a post with better than toddler level grammar."
