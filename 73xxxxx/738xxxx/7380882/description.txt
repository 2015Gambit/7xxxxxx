A small town girl and a city boy meet on the Sunset Strip, while pursuing their Hollywood dreams



WORKDONE:

Ok took the russian camrip and cleaned it up alot.First removed the russian warninng crap of the start.
Opted too leave the first 3mins where the cam gets covered up alot,but its only them singing,nothing major missed..
but this way you have the option too cut it or leave it :)
Colours were well fooked up so lowered the chroma right down too 30%,but increase it via the sat option in the rgb eq filter
i used as it handles it better without going all rainbow effect on me lol.
Also did all the normal of smoother,brightness,contrast etc....
Audio ....took the file we were given,cut all unnwanted stuff and then syncd it too the video....once done dropped in AA and
gave it some sweet lovin.

Readnfo - basically when syncing we came across 4 parts where the video jumps,in total 10 secs and the fact the first 3mins
has a hand over half the cam.
But at the mo ONLY video out so,hey ho ....i've watched it and it doesn't spoil the film.
