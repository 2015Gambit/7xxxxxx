To help the people that will download, can you make a list of the included mods/programs? (Spark IMG is considered a program, not a mod.)"
,LilGunner,2012-06-26T00:12Z,"@Rawklord
Thank You for suggesting to list the mods/programs. And, for a positive feedback on what I included. I'll get started on the list and it'll be updated. I just wonder if people will keep seeding so that one computer (mostly mine) wouldn't have to be on. Still, thank you for the suggestion and positive feedback."

,epicdragon47,2012-06-29T22:06Z,Stuck on 90.9%. Did I do something wrong or not do something right?
,LilGunner,2012-07-01T21:01Z,"@epicdragon47
No dude, you're ok. It's just that my laptop keeps shutting down a lot and I have important meetings to attend, and I can't keep my laptop on so much because it overheats. When I get a new laptop by August 1st, I'll try to get the torrent to work here you can keep downloading. But, if people keep seeding, maybe I won't need to have my laptop on all the time. And, sorry for the delays."
,georgeee123,2012-07-06T10:27Z,was on like the 2nd mission when you return with your crew on the bikes to your culdesac/house and there was literately a fence blocking all entry... i found a short side fence and was able to hope it but i can't leave on the next mission where i need a car.
,georgeee123,2012-07-07T07:00Z,okay i found an entrance to the alley? how do i use the mods im new to mods and stuff.
,LilGunner,2012-07-24T02:28Z,"@georgeee123
Ok, for the fence issue, I'll upload a maps backup for your issue. And, sorry for the late reply, because I was held up on something more important. Expect to see it by tomorrow."
,LilGunner,2012-07-24T02:40Z,"@georgeee123

,LilGunner,2012-07-24T22:30Z,"Guys, I'm not gonna keep open the laptop anymore. You guys, the downloading people got to seed it."
