This is Fox's Peter Pan and the Pirates from 1990 in it's entirety (all 65 episodes)
I'm not sure if they're in order of air date
I can't take credit for this file as a whole and did not rip them myself
I spent two months downloading little itty pieces from another couple of sites and finally unpacked them all in one whole file to re upload for ease
Thanks to Songspell for the initial point in the right direction from the comments in another torrent
It's an old show so the quality isn't the greatest, but it's watchable for sure
This is my first torrent so any constructive criticism or comments is greatly appreciated
