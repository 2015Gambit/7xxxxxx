Description from Doctor Who News:

The secret of immortality revealed? Find out in "Torchwood: Web of Lies", a unique 10 part companion to the new Russell T Davies series "Torchwood: Miracle Day."

A parallel narrative to the "Torchwood: Miracle Day" that delves deeper into the dramatic events which unfold in the TV series. "Torchwood: Web of Lies" includes lead characters Captain Jack Harkness and Gwen Cooper ΓÇô voiced by John Barrowman and Eve Myles ΓÇô AND introduces Eliza Dushku as the voice of Holly, a young woman intent on finding out what has happened to her brother and the world.

What happened to Jack and Gwen on that "missing day" back in 2007 - the day that neither remembers? Is it possible that a young, paranoid conspiracy theorist actually stumbled into the chilling truth and what it means for Miracle Day? The ONLY place to find out is in "Torchwood: Web of Lies."

Torchwood: Web of Lies is written by HUGO award winner Jane Espenson and Ryan Scott and Executive Produced by Russell T Davies.
