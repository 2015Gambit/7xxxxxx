,diverdiva,2012-08-08T07:21Z,"Thanks for this cqlanik! Big file to dload in one hit, so will do a few books a month - once I have them all, will leave to seed 4eva! Thanks for no .rar, too!"
,diverdiva,2012-08-13T16:14Z,Book 2 - Light Fantastic is uloaded from cassette and is very scrambled (e.g. part 07 is actually part 02 and the end of that jumps to another segment)
,diverdiva,2012-08-25T06:48Z,"Same with Book 6 - Wyrd Sisters. Skips, misses big chunks of the narrative, exp Disc 7 & 8.  Overedited, maybe?? "
