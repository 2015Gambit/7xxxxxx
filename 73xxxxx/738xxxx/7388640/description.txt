Sea of Green - Vol. 3 - Hydroponic Cultivation
See, the only Hydroponics video in the world. The "Ebb and Flow technique, has been adapted to the Sea of Green method. Special "wick method" process allows nutrient free, final harvest for that much sought after "chemical free" smoke, which most other processes do not have. Mother plant care, cloning, light, air, water, pumps, pH., PPM, transplanting, man made mediums, etc. all you need to know to become an expert hydroponics grower. This process has simplified hydroponics, and is an excellent video, to help eliminate those "beginner mistakes".
