Totally useless upload you may see different GUI when you change effects or amps but nothing gonna change soundwise no matter how much you tweak the knobs.."

,Joshua911,2012-07-28T19:49Z,"@ buttslaya117.. How did you update POD Farm? I installed it and everything is working fine but I can't find the right file to update. It either says, ""Invalid directory"" or ""This program cannot update the installed version of Line 6 POD Farm 2.5 Platinum because of the following reason: The destination directory doesn't contain any files to update.

Can you help me?"
