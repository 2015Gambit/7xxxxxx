BBQ Pitmasters features an all-star panel of judges: celebrity chef Art Smith, BBQ champion Myron Mixon, and Superbowl winner Warren Sapp, and is hosted by chef Kevin Roberts.

 Each episode brings together four BBQ teams to face off in a series of challenges that reveal who has the best mastery of meat ΓÇö but with a twist. 

While the main challenge focuses on a popular protein ΓÇö from ribs to brisket ΓÇö the contestants will also face a "Pit Fire Challenge," cooking a more exotic meat (alligator, rattlesnake, etc.) 
that will truly test their culinary skills. And the stakes are high ΓÇö the team with the worst Pit Fire dish is sent home on the spot.

This isn't a competition for the casual cook. 
From being over the pit non-stop for over 10 hours, to facing unexpected challenges, these aspiring Pitmasters all have the goal of satisfying the picky palates of the judging panel and taking home the $100,000 prize.
 It's the biggest competition of their lives in the all-new season of BBQ Pitmasters.
