Description:

The War You Don't See - John Pilger (2010)

John Pilger investigates the media's role in war, tracing the history of 'embedded' and independent reporting from the carnage of the First World War through to the destruction of Hiroshima, the invasion of Vietnam and the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. As the nature of war has changed, who is the real enemy today? Is it the people at home watching TV? And is the journalist's job to normalise the unthinkable? The film contains shocking, never before seen footage from Iraq and Afghanistan and revealing interviews with former BBC reporter Rageh Omaar, former CBS anchor Dan Rather and Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks.

Famed journalist and filmmaker John Pilger is in the States to research his new documentary THE WAR YOU DON'T SEE, about the real stories that the mainstream media isn't telling You The People.

The more we educate You The People about the Corporate War Machine, the more you'll see the dastardly deeds that are being done, in secret around the world, using your hard-earned tax money, i.e. in your NAMES.


The Enemy Within - A Global Conspiracy:
Full Length Feature - Since our nation's inception in 1776 - cold, cunning conspirators have sought to undermine our political sovereignty for their own personal profit. Behind a facade of corporate and congressional respectability, a cabal of ruthless men use extortion and murder to steal our nation's wealth and turn the United States into a fascist war-machine that inexorably threatens the entire world. But now at last, the American people are rising to unmask "THE ENEMY WITHIN"!
