Tim Barry

40 Miler (2012) Chunksaah Recrods

2012 album from the singer/songwriter and former leader of Punk band Avail.
Throughout 40 Miler, the rough-hewn characters populating Barry's lyrics refuse
to surrender even in the face of long odds. 40 Miler also finds Barry taking his 
spare Folk-Country sound in a different direction. This time around Barry opts for
more raucous, rocking approach on several tracks, adding more electric guitar,
organ, piano, harmonica, as well as the gorgeous voice of Richmond songstress 
Julie Karr to the mix.
