I will always love you
Turn the beat around
Everybody has a dream
Sweet Dreams
How will I know
Stuttering
Fallin
Try a little tenderness
Bohemian Rhapsody
Dance with my father
Proud Mary
You are so beautiful
Steal Away
And I am telling you
Eternal Flame (with Hollie Cavanagh)
My all
I don't wanna miss a thing
I'll be there
I have nothing
The Prayer
Change nothing
