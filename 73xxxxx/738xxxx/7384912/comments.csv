,nimd4,2012-06-25T09:52Z,"@condo767 the show is somewhat like Torchwood, except it doesn't completely suck ass like that show does, so that makes it great in comparison. ;)"
,Mark1108,2012-06-25T11:03Z,I completely agree with condo767!

,smeghead1983,2012-06-25T17:03Z,"@condo767 yea this show is pretty good. It gives me my sci fi fix because there really isn't anything good on right now

@nimd4 Torchwood was awesome except for Miracle day which was horrid.

@hookah604 the show is called continuum for a reason. As proven by the smile on the old mans face in the first episode when she originally went back in time, all of this has happened before. They aren't going to change the future, they are going to CAUSE the future to happen."
,Polymathj,2012-06-26T00:19Z,There is a scene missing/cut.  At 31:47 it hops in the middle of the scene then it cuts that same scene off at 32:00.

,hookah604,2012-06-26T09:15Z,"@smeghead1983  Yeah I know that. But still, its not a future I want to live in..."

,Squito,2012-07-06T21:51Z,"Well I don't really care that much about acting, I simply want to keep watching the episodes because of the story (besides Rachel and Lexa are both on my hottest actresses toplist). Have you guys noticed that the future the story describes is actually the present we live in told in a 'bit' different way? I mean our present is already ruled by wealthy people we don't know s**t about. In the future described by this story the world is ruled by big corporations... big, bad, greedy corporations. I hope I'm not the only one who can see the similarities."
