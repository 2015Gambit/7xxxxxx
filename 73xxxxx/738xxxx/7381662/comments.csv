,d_gorn,2012-06-24T15:27Z,"bunghole7: the purpose of comments is to inform other would-be downloaders. 

You know, as opposed to trolling and cursing ppl you don't even know, and wouldn't have the cajones to do it face-to-face. 

I don't have to go anywhere else; I'll just download one of the good versions on TPB. And one that attract less classless clowns like you."
,d_gorn,2012-06-24T15:32Z,"And oh look! I'm not the only one who rated this torrent down!

So for the rest of you guys - you know, the non-hit-and-runners like bunghole7 who flame and flee - grab another of the many versions here."
