,annayo,2012-07-07T15:17Z,does anyone know where i can download the english subtitles for this movie? thannks
,lizmm,2012-07-09T12:04Z,"I don't wanna be critical cos I've never uploaded anything in my life and I appreciate everything that other people try to do.  The video quality is good enough to follow the story, but has people walking in front of the screen and at times it is at some pretty random angles.  The big problem for me with this one is the audio, as spanish is my second language I really struggled to decipher what they were saying, having said that, my spanish friend is now watching it with no problem.  As there seem to be only 2 versions available, thanks for the effort uploader, but I've gotta wait for an AC3 audio track or I can't understand enough of the dialogue."

,keeian,2012-07-19T12:02Z,hi is it possible to get better quality? i would really appreciate it. thank you
,3juddy3,2012-07-23T14:20Z,oh the quality and the movie are terrible. I liked the back of the guys's head through most of the movie. I wonder what was on the fist third of the screen that was cut off??
