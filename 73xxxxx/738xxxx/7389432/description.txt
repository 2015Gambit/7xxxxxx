The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities
The Tower, an observational documentary which has been filmed over three years, charts the urban regeneration of the notoriously troubled Pepys Estate in South London. A property developer is turning a dilapidated former council high-rise into luxury riverside apartments and another is being demolished and rebuilt for public sector workers.  
The series features poignant portrayals of residents including Leol, a heroin addict, and his friend Nicky, an alcoholic, who met in a skip where they were collecting scrap metal to sell; Edith, mother of six children and heavily pregnant, who lives virtually alone in Dickensian conditions amongst rats and burst water pipes in the block to be demolished; young parents Kelly and Wayne, who are looking forward to their marriage; and Doug, who runs the local boozer, The John Evelyn. Doug hopes it will attract the fashionable new clientele, but the locals describe it as "God's waiting room".
The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities won the best factual series BAFTA award in 2008.
