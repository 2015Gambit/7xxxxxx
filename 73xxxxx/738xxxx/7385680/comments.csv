Q: How do I install these mods?
A: I recommend to use the included Cracked Mod Manager. If you use the official Nexus Mod Manager, that is fine too, but if you can't or don't want to use the official version (because they force you to log in to your Nexus account to even use the application), then go ahead and use the included cracked version. To install the apps, first install the Mod Manager and then drop all your mods into C:GamesSkyrimMods. Then open the mod manager and double-click the mods you want to activate or deactivate. Never worry about the first ""Plugins"" tab on the Mod Manager (that's for advanced users only). Just go to the Mods tab to activate and deactivate your mods.

Q: Should I use all of these mods?
A: You shouldn't use all the mods at the same time especially since a lot are duplicates, so that you can choose the best for your likes and for compatibility with your PC. Having all the different versions by different people makes it a lot easier to choose when using the Mod Manager.

Q: Where can I read more about each of these mods?
A: You can read more by visiting the respective page on the Nexus site. You can do that without an account. It would take me too long to try to add each and every link to this description, but I might consider doing it for you sometime. Just not now, I don't have the time.

Q: I noticed a ""cache"" folder in the torrent
A: Yes, that is there for your use. The cache folder contains all the manual updates which I did like changing name and fixing correct version number, that the original file didn't have. You can drop this cache folder directly into C:GamesSkyrimMods along with the rest of your mods. When you restart the Mod Manager, all the correct names and version numbers that I manually edited will be fixed. This should save you some time!"
