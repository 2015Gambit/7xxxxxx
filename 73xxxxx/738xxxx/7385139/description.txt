iPad optimized! (YES! We still thinK this is great and timeless stuff!)

Color corrected and light levels sometimes adjusted when original was too extreme.

BROKEN DOWN INTO INDIVIDUAL LESSONS AND DRILLS!

Why?

Terry Laughlin has a brilliant swimming technique.

But watching an entire DVD in a linear fashion (or listening to one of his lectures or presentations) simply does not enable mastery of the lessons.

And the rate he dishes out his info on video, in lecture or in presentations is always too much too fast.

Because each lesson builds on the previous, it's ineffective and pointless to roll along watching the video until you can correctly implement the principal being taught.

We have found that outside of the water, individual lessons on the iPad work great for very young swimmers, particularly with water babies -- they are great divers but lousy surface swimmers.

The basic lessons are the core and foundation of good swimming.

It helps make the water your friend.

It helps you appreciate and maximize efficiency, balance, symmetry.

Technique matters.

Once you have mastered these basic principals, then you can make your own choices about what other coaches and techniques and drills will best help you achieve your personal goals.

Some competitive swimming coaches are critics of Laughlin.

But no point in doing grueling laps and distances in practice and trying to swim FAST if you have a fundamentally flawed swimming technique -- and I've seen plenty of coaches let the youngest swimmers ingrain bad habits lap after lap, day after day until the kid had little hope of ever totally breaking all the bad habits and becoming a great swimmer.

Thanks to everyone who kept our swimming torrents alive while we were away! We appreciate it greatly! You are AWESOME!
