,shamanist,2012-06-27T01:42Z,"@e8hffff--I agree that the school system has developed into a system for turning out drones and dumbing them down to a proper level, but I don't see churches as being any better especially since the alliance of the Far Right (Reich?) and Fundamentalism (owned and operated by their Masters the 1%). As an ancient Progressive of the 50s and 60s I decry the state of this country, too."
