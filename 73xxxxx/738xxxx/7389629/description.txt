TVersity can only read certain formats of playlist information and you have to convert iTunes playlists to M3U format using iTunes Export. Simply run the program and choose which iTunes playlist to convert. Then choose where to save the converted
playlist (I recomend saving it in you "My Music" directory since TVersity automatically scans there for audio). Once that is done, you open TVersity and click on "Library" on the top bar. Then, under "Sources" in the side bar, choose "File System" and then "Files". Click on "+ Add Item" and hit "Browse". Find your converted playlist and open it. TVersity will then scan that playlist file and add it to the server for you to listen to on other devices.
