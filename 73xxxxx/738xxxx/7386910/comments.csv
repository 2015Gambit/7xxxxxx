,LionCourt1966,2012-06-27T07:20Z,"I assume putting them back in the original folder that you first made the torrent in, then load the torrent file like you were going to download it, rescan it, should show all files are done, and hopefully it will let you to start seeding."

HOW YOU ASK

Make sure you have 2 folders one is for downloading and the second is completion where the files are moved automatically when everything is done

To avoid haveing the torrent redownload just move all stuff to the 1 folder the download folder

Use utorrent it is free small and good :)"
