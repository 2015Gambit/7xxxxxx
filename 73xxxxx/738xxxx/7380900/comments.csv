reasons why i think its fake are:
1. its meant to be released 2010, how can they think about gears of 5.. (at that time gears 3 was a possibility.
2. hiring for the 720 designers did not start til late 2010 early 2011. this also includes the architecture. 
3. this document, in one form or another, has been going around for a couple of months before taking this 'final' layout.

of course... i could be wrong ..."
