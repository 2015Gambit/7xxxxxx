,.Leto.,2012-07-02T11:46Z,"Considering this is 2 GB I was expecting a much better quality. Picture is really grainy, definition is really poor."
,.Leto.,2012-07-03T01:22Z,"Never mind picture quality, I stopped watching after 20 minutes. Here's all I'll remember about this show: blah-blah blah-blah blah-blah ..."
,wenex,2012-07-03T17:18Z,"Yeah, you have to actually be able to follow a dialogue to enjoy this show. But hey, if you have a bit of a brain, this is one of the most incredible new shows of the year. Aaron Sorkin, from the earlier seasons of the west wing, is back. "
,yashrg,2012-08-31T15:20Z,The Grain Leto mentions is just noise from the low light sequence in the beginning! The quality of the video is awesome!
