Hello! We all know that World of Warcraft was made and created by Blizzard. I give them all the credit for making this wonderful game, but most people can't afford to play it, so that is where the Private Servers come in. Sad thing is, when a Private Server gets to much attention, Blizzard sues them and forces them to shut it down. I can't believe they won't let us, people that don't want to use their rent, food, etc money on a game to play for only month. Anyways, this torrent has the 2.4.3 client and it's already installed. I have some addons in the Interface folder located in the World of Warcraft folder. :)

I found one good, if you like funservers and custom items, server.Level cap is 200. You start at level 100, but talk to a NPC and level up to 200. You start in Hyjal and you kill the mob called 'X MEN' and get the Badge of Justice to get T1. Yet again I do remind you that all Tier sets are custom made, so are the instances.. Well, same boss but different levels and lot more HP. Hehe. :)

The best way to download/install the torrent is either with BitTorrent (http://www.bittorrent.com/) or UTorrent (http://www.utorrent.com/) Well, I only use them to, but there is Vuze (http://vuze.com) If you know any more Torrent downloaders, then post in the comments. :D

Okay, besides all that, you can scan the file if you want.. It's virus free, just make sure you SEED! Happy torrenting to you all! :D
