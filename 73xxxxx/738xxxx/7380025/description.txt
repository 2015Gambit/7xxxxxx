This is Winning Eleven Online Beta, downloaded from Evo-web.

1.Extract anywhere you want.
2.Start WEO_releas2.exe in exe folder
3.Play (only training mode)
Game is on Korean!!!

It's still just beta, you can play training mode ONLY , nothing else, so here we go BUT do not thank me, I'm only testers and Uploader, a man who you must be very grateful is Reddwarf.
This guy is a genius.

Its just training mode single player game, is JUST BETA, the game is not ready , maybe will have bugs and unbalance parts, don'f forget first to config setting exe in "SetOptGui" folder, on the first, Display menu with scrolling down you can chose some details level settings and most important thing is .. start the game from " WEO_releas2.exe " in exe folder
So , have fun and say thank you to Reddwarf and Konami and Hangames and... yeah i hope you like the game .
Cheers .

P.S. Reddwarf work to convert the game on English
