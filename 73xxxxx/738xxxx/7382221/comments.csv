,GoWaTeam,2012-06-24T17:12Z,"Great torrent, here is my review:
First of all, I think for LoK, this one is the best public torrent online! Let me explain why.

The video has a weird ""720p"" 960x718 aspect ratio. For some, that might be a problem but it's not noticeable, unless you watch the monitor from 30 cm or less (I only noticed the duplicated pixels after I saw the desription of the file). It has no logos, so in my opinion it's more enjoyable, than a 1080p TV rip with a logo. It doesn't have any commercial breaks, which is also a good thing.

The audio. What really makes this torrent the best is really the outstanding audio quality. Compare all the existing torrents for an episode and see for yourself. Really.

V: 9
A:10+++

Sorry for the lot of talk, but I really wanted to help the fans find the most enjoyable quality!"
,GoWaTeam,2012-06-24T17:20Z,Btw can someone tell me why is the 960x718 bad if what you see is great? Can it cause some compatibility problems?

,hedontyo,2012-07-03T19:19Z,"The audio of episodes 3 and 6 is mono only.
The video has been de-interlaced to 30 fps instead of 24, so it's jerky (every fifth frame is duplicated)."
