Thanks to DNS servers we surf the Internet using names such as "www.simpledns.com" instead of impossible to remember IP addresses.
DNS servers translate these domain names into machine readable IP-addresses needed to locate the requested web-server on the Internet.
What makes Simple DNS Plus "simple" is its user interface and automation features. All options and settings are available directly from the intuitive Windows user interface. It provides wizards for common tasks such as setting up new zones, importing data, making bulk updates, etc. You never need to mess with cryptic configuration files or registry settings. Novice users can have their DNS server up and running correctly and securely in no time.
But make no mistake - Simple DNS Plus is a very capable and full featured DNS server, and it has plenty of options for expert users to tweak it just the way they want.
