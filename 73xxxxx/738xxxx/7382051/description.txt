The Singles is a compilation of singles by The Who that was released in the November of 1984. An expanded version was releases as SHM-SACD in Japan in 2011.
One imagines that this collection was aimed at the total neophyte listener ΓÇö taken in any other context, this is an odd collection of single sides by one of the premiere singles bands of the 1960s and early ΓÇÖ70s. Does it start at the beginning, with either ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm the FaceΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£I CanΓÇÖt ExplainΓÇ¥? No. Does it encompass many of the freestanding singles issued by this band through 1972? No. Does it even offer any of the less well-known single sides from that period? No ΓÇö apart from the three-and-a-half-minute single edit of ΓÇ£WonΓÇÖt Get Fooled Again,ΓÇ¥ which was hardly a sterling example of the format or the genre. Instead, listeners get all of the most familiar hits, albeit in their original mono mixes where relevant: ΓÇ£Substitute,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm a Boy,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Pictures of Lily,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£I Can See for Miles,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Pinball Wizard,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Squeeze Box,ΓÇ¥ etc. The best of it overlaps with Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, among other collections, so veteran collectors and listeners will find nothing unique here.
