,leon47,2012-06-25T12:38Z,"hi there YIFY first of all, thanks for sharing your PERFECT QUALITY 3D movies, I'm new here at 3D movie thingy, and I have no idea which glasses should I take?

I'm planning to buy a projector for my laptop for home cinema, and I was just wondering if this movie is compatible for POLARIZED 3D Glasses?

I have a couple of questions here (this will help noobies like me)

1) will Polarized 3D Glasses work on Laptop/LCD TV/Projectors?
2) Does all 3D Movies here at Piratebay is for POLARIZED Glasses?

thanks in advance hoping for your reply, sorry for my bad english, and thanks again for GREAT VIDS :)"

,Schlongo,2012-07-02T05:29Z,"Hi, I know there are alot of these comments but I promise im not an ignorant ungratefull kid,

Im just curious how I can get this to work with my LG 3d Cinema tv using a usb and my playstation 3?

It only comes up as the side-by-side version and my tv runs the polzarized passive interlaced type of 3d,

If anyone could comment and help me it would be much appreciated.

Thanks :),"
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2012-07-04T23:45Z,"@Schlongo first you dont need the playstation. The console is just for 3d bluray discs. With the downloaded file all you need is the 3d tv. 

1-Copy the movie to your usb stick or external hard drive and conect it to your tv.

2-Go to your tv media player, under videos, find the file and play it
You will get 2 almost identical images side-by-side

3-While playing go to the tv menu or options and select 3d as active for side-by-side.

4-Enjoy with your glasses turned on

PS: Usually there are 3 3d options availible:
a) 2d-to-3d - converts 2d content to a poor quality 3d. 
b) 3d side-by-side - merges right and left images of a 3d original side-by-side content into one (most common).
c) 3d top-and-bottom - merges top and bottom images of a 3d original top-and-bottom content into one.

Should be real easy"
,rambini,2012-07-19T20:09Z,Great quality. Thx for downloading.
,shaitand,2012-07-22T21:43Z,"Audio is low quality (90kbps bitrate) AAC in Stereo. Can't convert back to bluray because of AAC audio. Fine for pc playing but forget it on a home theater setup. Probably best to stick with 6GB+ rips for home theater, large screen and non-headache 3D needs high res with no artifacts and surround sound needs at least 5.1."

,walkingthroughhell,2012-09-10T06:03Z,@leon47  no you have get a nvidia 3d vision with certified monitor or amd 3d technology. Polarised glasses just work with movie theatre. for laptop and lcds you have to use lcd shutter glasses
