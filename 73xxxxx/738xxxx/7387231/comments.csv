,elitecrusher,2012-06-27T03:06Z,Why cant you all just comment on the scale of the movie?? Does it suck or is it bad ass! You all come on here and say the same thing.
,aa1234779,2012-06-27T04:57Z,"no trailer or reviews or ratings on imdb..

if somebody has seen it plz write something in addition to torrent quality."
,skulldragon,2012-06-27T07:29Z,"In short: DO NOT DOWNLOAD & STOP SEEDING THIS CRAP!!
In full length: just keep on reading...

A & V are both 9.

For video quality I indeed give a thumbs up, but I also wish to give this movie itself a thumbs down, but I have to be a IMDB Pro paid member for that. Just like I always say: only the rich criticize and the poor just whine.

Okay, I try to review this. At first I thought, what a cheap movie name, but I still hoped it would be good. I was right and wrong.
The beginning was as I like to call it ""something new"". But, when I saw the first monster, I asked myself ""Is this it?"" and it kept getting worse. Indeed, from the first encounter to the end of the movie, it was nothing but cheap, poorly made, illogical shit.
The beginning had a good story, but the rest had no story, more like just an ""idea"", but sb just forgot to turn that idea into a proper story.

I bet this movie will eventually have score of 3 at IMDB. I already see the chart taking a nice fall.

This is actually the second ""available (at TPB) before public release"" movie that sucked. Must be a marketing trick or smthn.
TPB should do something about the TOP 100 list. This movie is already 5th movie in a row, which sucked ass. Don't count leechers into TOP 100 anymore, just seeders. Or maybe this is because anti-piracy assholes take down seeders of quality releases?

Note to myself:
Never download any movies, which don't have any ratings or pro. reviews. Early availability is no excuse."
,mvcomputers,2012-06-27T07:41Z,Have seen trailer on you-tube. Looks kinda cheesy and low budget. Check it out at you-tube.

Skulldragon, you sound like a real asshole!"
,dfl3506,2012-06-28T03:45Z,"A10, V10 Movie is absolute garbage. Not in the least bit scary and ridiculous ending.  "

,joeledward,2012-07-12T10:55Z,"Are u all mad! It doesnt matter if the movie sucks or the acting is crap!!! We come here to down load movies for free!!!!!! This is not a critic site. Comments should be restricted to quality of upload only!!!! Any other comments keep tp yourself, because we pirates dont give a shit about your thoughts on the movie or polital or religious beliefs or pet hates etc. Kudos to the uploaders for supplying the FREE content for all to download. PS stop demanding to SEEED No body ever listens to your shouting, seed if you can if you can,t too bad. The uploaders should seed their torrents or take them down."

Movie:Worse than anal rape with a splintery piece of wood/10

This was godawful, I tried. I really did. I just kept hoping. I knew inside though, as soon as I saw the first creature. If only I could go back... If only."
,mh2372,2012-07-31T18:43Z,"@ joeledward

You're so wrong. I place more weight on the opinions of other DLers like myself than the stupid hollywood employed critics and websites. Keep posting your opinions people and joeledward if you're incapable of spotting the A/V ratings within a post and skipping the rest... Well, that says something about your intelligence. Doesn't it?"

I usually like this kind of movie, but this was just shit... no plot, no special effects, no acting, no good."
