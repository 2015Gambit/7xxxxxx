,snowdog1,2012-07-18T09:53Z,"Hard subbed Japanese, usual early cam problems - clarity, cropping, audio & missing a few seconds at the end. Rate just reasonable copy for the kids... if you really want to see, other wise wait. Small file, fast to download ++. Rather than negative comment, do it yourself then upload - the Team make the effort. Go Team, Thanx..."
,snowdog1,2012-07-20T14:03Z,Not a good release at all. craft553 and jonny_nt were  on the mark. Don't bother.
