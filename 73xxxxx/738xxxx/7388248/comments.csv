,remsta67,2012-06-26T11:18Z,"This is bullshit, I down mind a bit of free downloading but this girl is just starting out and has lived in refuges and foster homes all her life. Give her a chance to make a bit of money before stealing off her. GO BUY HER MUSIC!"
,nobby58,2012-06-26T12:04Z,"Mate, I bought her music. That's why it's here. If you don't want to download it, don't. There are a lot of people out there that can't afford the money record companies are asking for CD's.  Clearly you were looking for it or you wouldn't be here."
,blackwhitebeachballs,2012-06-26T13:11Z,"Could we please get this in FLAC, thx. :)"
,angelpammmy,2012-06-26T15:06Z,have to admit i never buy cds...and i did question if i should fork out and buy this cos she is just starting out...but i figure i did buy all her voice cds off itunes to support her and get her there even tho i really am poor...plus voted a shit load of times. i feel ok bout it...thanks heaps for posting.

,Griffalot,2012-06-26T19:19Z,"In the U.S, right now I can only purchase the physical CD from her website - which I did. In the meantime, I am grabbing this to listen until it arrives.

By all means, support this girl by buying the music, but don't assume that everyone that grabs the download isn't!"
,evilg0d,2012-06-28T11:25Z,Thanks for sharing this. I truly appreciate it.
,leather522001,2012-06-30T07:00Z,"Thanks heaps man!

Any chance of getting the front/back/cd covers. I searched all over but couldn't find any.

Again thanks mate."
,Kommy1,2012-06-30T11:22Z,"awesome Upload!!!
 Thanks and ignore the haters. A bit hypocritical in my opinion. Who gives them the right to tell us who we can and cant ""steal"" from??? Either do it with no regrets or delete pirate bay and ur torrent program at all!!"
,Frokkel,2012-07-03T08:33Z,I agree with some of you. I too decided to pay for this one instead. $15.65 on Bigpond Music. Only because I really want Karise to keep on making music. She is unique in the Australian music scene - that's all.
