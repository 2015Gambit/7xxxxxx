,nowlit,2012-06-25T04:49Z,ettv is never fake!! :)
,GrassyAss311,2012-06-25T04:49Z,The fact its .mp4 same size is past files and its ettv posting real would be a good assumption....
,acrian,2012-06-25T04:51Z,THANK YOU ETTV!!! Why do they let loosers like HeroMaster post their password protected rar crap??? They what me to fill out personal info for an unlock password... I don't think so... HeroMaster can go suck a dick.
,pw4x3r,2012-06-25T04:52Z,where are the fucking comments
,Cegal,2012-06-25T04:55Z,"Might be real but to get a ""password"" you have to go to a website etc...screw that."
,mibmib007,2012-06-25T04:56Z,real of course.. why ask.. 
,VenoseDL,2012-06-25T04:58Z,"stop being so greedy u bastards....

,killacloud69,2012-06-25T04:59Z,people really need to learn to seed even just a little
,Shiloh25,2012-06-25T04:59Z,@moviemansteve this is real. I've dl'd first two episodes from this user. Always great quality.
,fstnomad,2012-06-25T05:01Z,This is fake. comes with a password URL that takes you to one of those scam survey sites.
,The3leven,2012-06-25T05:04Z,ettv is can always be trusted. [Check for green skulls]
,ElSofoque,2012-06-25T05:06Z,Real
,ElSofoque,2012-06-25T05:08Z,Come on people seed this thing! Download speed is terrible!
,trick721,2012-06-25T05:08Z,"It's an ""official"" uploader. It's real."
,str_mape,2012-06-25T05:10Z,It's ettv of course it's real
,ElSofoque,2012-06-25T05:10Z,"I don't know why they allow people to upload the fake torrents. It is such a waste of time, do they have nothing better to do?

Seed this one guys! Download speed could use some serious bump!"
,drummerpunk7,2012-06-25T05:13Z,WTF is with the upload speed here? 1600+ people and it's only 3.6kb? what the shit?
,Sz9983,2012-06-25T05:14Z,"If it's from a VIP poster, it's going to be real.  "
,Woggy7s,2012-06-25T05:24Z,Guys stop bitching.
,firexninja,2012-06-25T05:25Z,thank you!
,Throracle,2012-06-25T05:34Z,"Its fake, the mp4 is in a .rar file with a site link"
,FTP-,2012-06-25T05:36Z,This is the real deal. Don't complain about seeds as the torrent has just been released so obviously there's not going to be as much seeds...
,mjavant,2012-06-25T05:37Z,"2207 seeders and im getting it at 10/kb, come on guys....SEED!"
,MalikeW,2012-06-25T05:42Z,"^

,MalikeW,2012-06-25T05:43Z,my post intended for throracle.
,Praetorian909,2012-06-25T05:45Z,Excellent!  But XviD/avi please :)
,shannybaby,2012-06-25T05:45Z,Grr need more seeders !!!!
,pyroarch,2012-06-25T05:48Z,"2700 seeders and 15000 leechers, its going to be slow. Its very simple to understand..."
,aradiel,2012-06-25T05:59Z,"The ettv torrents are real. They're also usually one of the first to upload. Personally, I prefer the x264 codec files, but if you want to wait for the XviD for compatibility, go ahead.

If you click the files section of the torrent you can clearly see there are no .rar files or URLs to password sites."
,Honey5,2012-06-25T05:59Z,"Thanks ettv, know its going to be legit.
But slowest download ever 20kb/s, come awn."
,GatorTex,2012-06-25T06:07Z,Up to 400kb/s now.  Thanks!  Will seed.
,Honey5,2012-06-25T06:24Z,10 kb/s i want to watch come on!
,jchat2,2012-06-25T06:29Z,Its Fake
,drummerpunk7,2012-06-25T06:36Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7384794/True.Blood.S05E03.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD


downloaded in 10 minutes. Learn to seed fuckers."
,Sovix,2012-06-25T06:43Z,Dumb motherfucker whats the password
,botcrawl,2012-06-25T07:28Z,"There have been a lot of random spammers lately in comments, strange. Maybe it's someone which has credit in whatever it is they're spamming so they're subtly attempting to ruin online flow."
,Shpoogen,2012-06-25T08:54Z,im afraid this might be a spam torrent. posting  .RAR file with no password is too sketch.
,pyroarch,2012-06-25T09:30Z,Good quality! A+!! I will seed this for awhile.
,arildus,2012-06-25T11:00Z,Thanx:)
,mistaswinga,2012-06-25T11:22Z,Thanks ettv. This is NOT fake!
,iEncom,2012-06-25T19:10Z,People aren't spamming. There was an upload for this episode from someone pretending to be ettv which tries to make you go to a website and complete an offer for a password to the file.
,w00tbie,2012-06-27T03:54Z,thanks ettv udaman as always
,gohulu,2012-07-02T20:21Z,what is the password??
