,evil_138,2012-09-06T21:24Z,"Does anyone know where you can get the DVD's for this show? Thank ""khutton""
 you for sharing your files with all of us. I really love listening to the files, but I would really love to see the shows. I have seen Dev so many times; I live right in his area so he’s always playing around town. So you see that’s the point, he’s so animated and crazy that how could you not want to see the DVD’s. Any upload or any link would be much appreciated. Thanks again everyone for making this place possible. "
