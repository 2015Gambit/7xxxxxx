    When he is passed over for promotion in favor of a foreign-born 
    friend, Frank Taylor (Bogart), joins the anti-immigrant Black Legion, 
    a secret white supremacist organization portrayed as a northern 
    chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.


    Warner Bros. was forced to underplay some aspects of the group's political 
    activities to avoid legal repercussion. Nevertheless, the Ku Klux Klan 
    sued Warner Bros. for patent infringement for the film's use of a patented 
    Klan insignia, a white cross on a red background with a black square.

    Robert Lord's original story received an Academy Award nomination in 1937, 
    but lost to  A Star Is Born. However the National Board of Review named 
    Black Legion as the best film of 1937, and Humprey Bogart as the best actor 
    for his work in the film.
