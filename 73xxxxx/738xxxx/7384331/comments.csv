,karass99,2012-06-25T01:20Z,"thanks for the game!  just wanted to point out that by giving specific names to each file you uploaded you have somewhat given spoilers for the match (although not the actual winner).
"
,slmndow,2012-06-25T02:12Z,Thank you very much!
,moriority5,2012-06-25T03:18Z,What's the password for this rar?  I'm not installing some bullsh*t adware bar.
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-06-25T03:45Z,"@ moriority5 What the fuck are you on about there is no rar file , there are only 5 avi files . 

But the real problem is , although at the moment it says 50 seeds , there doesnt seem to be anyone online that has the full torrent , been stuck for ages . "
,karass99,2012-06-25T03:45Z,there's a password?  will u please let me know it?
,karass99,2012-06-25T03:47Z,A Euro Quarter Final and there's only one torrent on pirate bay?  that seems really weird to me.
,IRAkAiSZTmU5qDLYmiUsb85Rx,2012-06-25T03:48Z,"I'm really grateful to you for uploading the file however don't names them so specifically, why not part 1,2,3,4 etc? Anyone downloading who doesn't know the result get someone to rename the files for them."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-06-25T03:54Z,"THERE IS NO EFFING PASSWORD AND THERE IS NO EFFING RAR FILE .

GETTING SEEDERS , THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM ."
,MayaJW,2012-06-25T04:16Z,thanx a bunch!!!!!! :)
,MayaJW,2012-06-25T04:19Z,just want to confirm.. who  ever mentioned password is BSing.. the torrent is legit.. 5 avi files.. currently seeding at good speeds for me! :)
,afy,2012-06-25T04:46Z,I advise anyone wanting to watch the match that does not want to know the result beforehand to download from a different torrent. The way the uploader has named the files gives away the outcome of the match and has killed the match for me.
,arsenal_rocks,2012-06-25T08:18Z,"ok everyone i said sorry in the description because i had some pproblem.
Next time if you want only 2 files with First Half and Second half you have to wait a little more time.
Thanks"
,2HardRain,2012-06-25T08:45Z,"This is not a comment for the uploader, because I really appreciate your work. The comment is that I find it strange that in the year 2012 we only have one low res upload from a Euro quarter final match of England VS Italy. Weird."
,slmndow,2012-06-25T11:19Z,"I already downloaded and the torrent is has a good quality video and audio, and i have no problem 5 avi or 2 avi as long you uploaded us semi-final and the finale of the games...i am greatful arsenal-rocks...good job"
,arsenal_rocks,2012-06-25T12:21Z,"I will upload till the end and the Final i will upload in normal quality AND in 720p.
I will put seperate file because of the size so no complaint. And the EURO 2012 will be my final release after it will be 2month after."
,furiouswindbottom,2012-06-25T17:48Z,"you should name a torent like this..

England vs Italy Euro 2012 MASSIVE SPOILER

Next time, don't bother unless you upload the full show or one file. Ruined it. "
,arsenal_rocks,2012-06-25T20:15Z,furiouswindbottom if you have problem so don't download it.
,furiouswindbottom,2012-06-26T17:34Z,"@arsenalrocks

My apologies. Was in a bad mood after seeing us lose on penalties again. 

Thanks for the upload anyway. Sure there's a reason you can't upload as one single file."
,arsenal_rocks,2012-06-26T18:12Z,"furiouswindbottom : It's ok .
Next time i will try to upload all the match in 1 single file but will take time as i will have to join all the files together.
BUT in HD 720p i will upload seperatly as the size is too much."
