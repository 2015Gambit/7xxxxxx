 PLOT:
 'A Last Goodbye' is an intimate look into the life and times of 
 Amy Winehouse. This in depth programme chronicles her rise to pop 
 superstardom and also offers a sensitive portrayal of a 
 transformative star and the inner demons that inspired her work 
 and eventually caused her untimely death. Her battle with 
 addiction and her courtship with self destruction were well 
 documented through the press. Even her troubled relationship with 
 Blake Fielder-Civil was played out in front of British media. But 
 despite this backdrop Amy Winehouse will be remembered for her 
 unique song writing style fusing R & B, soul and jazz influences 
 sang through a powerful deep contralto vocal. The 'Back to Black' 
 album symbolised her huge success at this time which led to an 
 astonishing 5 Grammy Awards, 'the most wins by a female artist in 
 a single night'. This insightful programme is a definitive 
 testimonial to an incredible music icon covering the start of her 
 career up until her death. Amy Winehouse (14/09/1983 to 23/07/2011)
