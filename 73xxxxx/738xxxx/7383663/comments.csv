,snapshot88,2012-07-08T20:34Z,"FSX w/acceleration crashes when it asked to run the ""ModulesMILVIZMilviz_pack.dll"" and you select yes. If you select no then the aircraft runs and flies ok but you can not use the weapons manager and I can't get the AA Radar to pick up any AI aircraft or change the range of the Radar. I followed the instillation notes closely! any help or ideas? "
