I am really sorry mate but the He-Man series isn't available in good quality on the internet. But if I find it in the future, I will surely try to do it :)"

Is it just me or some of the episodes audio are out of sync? if it's possible to fix it can somebody help me? :O"
,balgus112,2012-07-12T00:54Z,"Indeed a bunch of the episodes in the middle have audio echoing and going out of sync and some unwanted noise as well as complete silence for a couple of seconds. It would be great if it could be corrected and re uploaded. I tried different players and even a bunch of antivirus softwares to scan the videos with wrong audio, there werent any.
Not that I understand Japanese or anything, i just want to have a good copy since i downloaded almost 8 seasons from you.
Pls make sure that atleast within the season the files are of the same type ie. avi or mkv"
,balgus112,2012-07-12T00:56Z,"Well yeah :P sorry for not thanking you explicitly in this comment section, but i do my own way of thanking by seeding at least till 1:1 ratio and giving 5 stars in my torrent client :D
TY"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-07-12T05:04Z,"Well, to all the peeps who are having audio out of sync problem...yes I saw it recently that there's a problem there. I am really sorry about the inconvenience caused. Well, I am sorry but i cant re-upload it because i am really busy these days. But i will keep it in mind and try to do the rest of the seasons correctly.

Cheers"
