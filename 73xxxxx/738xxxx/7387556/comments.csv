,dgodinic1,2012-06-26T11:23Z,I need a 32 bit version
,GM128,2012-06-27T02:10Z,"@dgodinic1
I had planned to include the 32-bit and 64-bit installation in the same disc image, but the size exceeded the space available to a single-layered DVD.

I'm trying to decide whether I should release separate disc images or just make an all-in-one that requires a dual-layered DVD. USB flash drives can also be used.

@EdmundDorf
I could also care less whether you trust me or not. This is the start of my track record of clean posts. Everyone has to make their start at some point in time."

,l0uisz,2012-06-28T05:25Z,oops sorry for the double post ! -__- 
,GM128,2012-06-28T10:00Z,"@l0uisz
I would recommend googling something like ""upgrading from vista to windows 7"" for the answers you seek.

I always prefer a clean installation of an OS versus an upgrade. It's extra work, but there are fewer problems."
,l0uisz,2012-06-28T21:15Z,and @GM128 what about the serial # situation? is this copy already activated or something?
,GM128,2012-06-28T21:47Z,"Activation is left up to you. You can do it legitimately or by using Daz's Windows Loader which can be found on the MyDigitalLife's forums under ""MDL Projects and Applications"". I regularly use both methods on a case-by-case basis, so I didn't want to force it upon anyone."
,l0uisz,2012-06-29T02:56Z,@GM128 i want to do it illegitimately but how can i do it this way.... if the ISO didn't come with a serial # ? im Sorry bro im a lost soul LOL.
,l0uisz,2012-06-29T03:26Z,hey @GM128 and thanks in advance for ALL the help your giving man much muchhhh appreciated! SERIOUSLY! 
,GM128,2012-06-29T04:19Z,"@l0uisz
You don't need a serial prior to using Daz's Windows Loader. It applies one when you use it."
,l0uisz,2012-06-29T20:27Z,got it thank you ! @GM128

,anarchist9027,2012-07-04T01:47Z,@GM128; If you made a 32/64 single disc. It would be the shit. I got Dual-layered disc ready and waiting
,Rolf_Zeke,2012-07-05T12:16Z,"Varför har denna fil ingen filändelse, när den laddas ner. Det förvirrar. Jag chansade på att lägga till .iso och det funkade."
,GM128,2012-07-05T13:12Z,"@Rolf_Zeke
Jag vet inte vad du syftar på. Det har en ISO förlängning på slutet av filnamnet. Om du inte tror mig, klicka på länken under huvudfiler överst på denna sida.

Nästa gång kan du ha tillstånd att översätta din kommentar till samma språk alla andra använder för att kommunicera med. Jag skulle inte skriva en kommentar i engelska på en torrent där alla talar svenska. Tack."
