,ToRRaNt-1,2012-06-23T22:02Z,These re-enocdes are garbage stick with HULKSMASH much better quality. And if you can't get them to play it's most likely because you have outdated codes. They play fine in VLC for me and others I have talked to.
,syaugust8,2012-06-24T06:13Z,thanks for the re-encode.
,mufhuff,2012-06-24T09:33Z,"HULKSMASH encodes his files wrong, which causes them to not play for some people. Plus seeking is broken to shit. Updating codecs helps to at least play the files, but it's still a bad encode.
So until he (she/they/it) fixes things re-encodes are very welcome."
[T],spevman,2012-06-24T14:37Z,"Well, ToRRaNt-1, I'm so sorry my attempt at a re-encode doesn't meet your bitchy standards.  In light of your dissatisfaction, I'll refrain from ever uploading my content again...there, you happy fuck-twat?  Everyone else...please thank this fucktard of an leecher for my avoidance of ever sharing again...its not like my bandwidth is free..."
,babinxd,2012-06-24T23:38Z,oh no!!! don't stop pleaaaase!!!!
,ToRRaNt-1,2012-06-25T08:06Z,Not only are your encodes shit you were stealing content and repackaging it as your own which in it's self is a dick move. You did not give any credit to HULK for the uploads and then you criticize his/her methods. So yes I am pleased you have decided to stop wasting your bandwidth.
,mufhuff,2012-06-25T10:17Z,"Fuck yeah, internet drama!
spevman, you flipping out because of one guy is almost as dumb as HULKSMASH pretending to be someone else and trashing other people's uploads (hi, ""ToRRaNt-1"" :)).

I kinda thought it was supposed to be for the peoples, no? Just ego stroking, then?"
,ToRRaNt-1,2012-06-25T18:30Z,Look it's nothing against this guy. I believe all re-encodes are garbage. This AFG guy is the worst... actually aXXo is the biggest re-encode scumbag ever! Besides XviD is dead so why not atleast re-encode to mp4.
[T],spevman,2012-06-26T22:42Z,"Well, despite the opinion of one nutter, all re-encodes definitely AREN'T crap...especially since the scene has all but given up on XviD encodes.  I'm fortunate in that I know how to convert and size the files for those who don't know how.  Remember, no one is forcing you to download these.  Like my mother always taught me, If you don't have something nice to say, best to not say anything at all.

Also, as mufhuff pointed out, HULKSMASH doesn't quite do their encodes right.  I'm grateful to HULKSMASH for the effort in just putting files out there. However, I need to convert them before my BluRay player can read them, so I figure why not share that with everyone else since I'm doing it anyway.

Also, AFG, thank you for your re-encoding efforts.  You're pretty much the only person releasing a TON of shows in XviD format."
,syaugust8,2012-06-27T18:52Z,"well, hopefully someone does get around to ripping and sharing chelsea again; it's best not to take idiotic things that brats say behind the safety of the internet to heart.  it isn't anything personal, they're just morons!  thanks again for your time and efforts, spev!"
