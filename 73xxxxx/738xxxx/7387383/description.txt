The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities
The Tower, an observational documentary which has been filmed over three years, charts the urban regeneration of the notoriously troubled Pepys Estate in South London. A property developer is turning a dilapidated former council high-rise into luxury riverside apartments and another is being demolished and rebuilt for public sector workers. The changes are happening under the gaze of those still living in the original local authority houses next door. 
 
The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities won the best factual series BAFTA award in 2008.

1)  Part 1 
Five years after Lewisham council sold off one of its riverside tower blocks to be transformed into chic apartments for young professionals, the transformation of the Tower is due to begin. Before the private developers can move in, however, all the old tenants must go. Les Brooks, a professional clown, is the last existing occupant in the Tower and he's refusing to go quietly. Elsewhere on the estate, his neighbours have their own private battles to fight.
