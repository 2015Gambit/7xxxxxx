Her married lover wanted to leave her, her daughter hated her and her fellow barristers were determined that she should not be the next Head of Chambers. Even the office cleaner had a grudge against her. But step by step, the suspects are narrowed down, and the cunning plot that lies behind Venetia's death is brought to light...
