This book focuses less on the politics of HTML5 (though it does touch on this), and more on the ways to immediately integrate HTML5 - and its friends - into your web projects.


If you're in need of a book that will get you up and running with many of the new tags, form elements, and JavaScript APIs as quickly as possible, then this is the book for you.


ENJOY and SEED !!
