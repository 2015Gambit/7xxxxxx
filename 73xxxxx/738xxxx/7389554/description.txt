three daughters, who get caught in the middle of a tornado emergency while traveling to pick up Mr. Maguire from the airport as he’s been stationed overseas to fight for some time now. When the weather gets to be too much to handle, Janet (McGrane) and her girls take shelter in the storm cellar of a seemingly abandoned old farm house but quickly find that not only are they not alone, they have been trapped alongside something far more dangerous than a tornado.
