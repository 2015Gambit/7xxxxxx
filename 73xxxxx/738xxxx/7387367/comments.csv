,DLoThuggin,2012-07-09T05:19Z,"Alright. How come is this program kicking out on both 10.0.3.3 an 10.0.3.5? I did clean installs an removed the programs. 

I have malwarebytes an Avast 7. Nothing is detected I don't get it?"

If you are having troubles, heres how to install it:

1.Run the DAP.exe in the zip file and install (Unless you already have DAP 10)
2.Open your DAP file in ProgramFiles
3.Copy the DAP.exe file from the Crack folder in the zip file into your ProgramFiles folder.
4.Replace the old file and your done!"
,ind1234,2012-07-27T19:16Z,"works. but downloads by only 1 connection.
Any method of sorting this out."
,prince_yuri,2012-09-05T13:25Z,"Okay, premium activated, LITERALLY! And technically NO!! I got only 1 connection, which is the premium supposed to get me a 10 connections. This is a false positive! 
Switching to Free version, which can give me 4 connections."
