,tpbbabu,2012-08-21T06:48Z,"But wiki says dynamite warlord of mars is a 12 issue mini series.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barsoom#Comic_books)

But comicvine.com posted covers of its total twenty issues. Im confused.

Also warlord of mars : dejah thoris already has released a total of twenty issues.
