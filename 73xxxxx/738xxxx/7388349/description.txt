The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities
The Tower, an observational documentary which has been filmed over three years, charts the urban regeneration of the notoriously troubled Pepys Estate in South London. A property developer is turning a dilapidated former council high-rise into luxury riverside apartments and another is being demolished and rebuilt for public sector workers. The changes are happening under the gaze of those still living in the original local authority houses next door. 

The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities won the best factual series BAFTA award in 2008.

2)  Part 2 
The last tenant has been removed from the ex council tower block. The developers Berkley homes can now start the renovation. Their marketing department are keen to sell the virtues of riverside living, but on the estate there are others who are desperate to leave. Edith Corlis is expecting her seventh baby, her block too is due for redevelopment and most of her neighbours have left. However, she is stuck and the squatters have moved in and are making her life a misery. Although Kelley Garcia, Edith's best friend, has patched up her relationship with Wayne they have a more pressing crisis at home with their young son Tyrell. Lol Gilbert has failed to win his girlfriend back and has taken up again with the other love of his life, heroin. Strong language.
