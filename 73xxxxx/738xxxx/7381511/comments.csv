Gives me error what to do?"
,milbreno,2012-06-25T18:18Z,"Friend: as above, the folder "". Minecrat"" must be allocated correctly. If you prefer to use its official client, just replace the cracked minecraft.exe the original (as I did). The content is correct."

,pajasam,2012-07-03T11:22Z,I dont know how to create that server pls help
,milbreno,2012-07-04T03:10Z,"Pajasam@: Unzip the files. Open the folder server. Find server.proprietats. Edit this file with a notepad (+ N + recommended). Put the IP of your machine (to see it, go run, type cmd, and type ""ipconfig"") or leave it blank, and to enter the server, enter localhost. To start the server type run.bat. What else need to know?"
,milbreno,2012-07-04T03:17Z,"If you are under a router and want your friends to play on your server, you should release the port 25565 on the same router and check if your PC firewall is not blocking access. If your IP is fixed, just past the IP. Otherwise, you can provide it each time you go to play or create an account with NO-IP and create a host."
