Couldn't find this anywhere, well I mean I did, but it had no seeds what so ever, so thought I'd upload this for anyone who wanted it.

This was recorded at the Pistols' last gig at the Winterland Ballroom on January 14, 1978 before their 1996 reunion.

Anywayz, hope you enjoy it, I prefer live albums over video concerts, so yeah :P.
