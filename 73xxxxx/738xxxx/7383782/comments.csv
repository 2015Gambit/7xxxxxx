Now please, can you tell me how you get this quality? I'm ripping and ripping my cd with itunes and even with 320kbps, VBR, m4a I just can't get in the same quality as your release."

iTunes is proven to cause a lost in quality when its used to convert. And the M4A format isn't made to handle anything above 256kbps and also it isn't very supportive of VBRs. Thats your main issue. Convert it to 256kbps CBR. Also try other converters. That is the advice I can give you,"
