,baronww1,2012-07-07T12:49Z,WinRaR is not the only program that can open RAR files the one I use is 7zip which is free and easy to use and it can open just about any kind of zip RAR 7z and just about any other kind of zipped file format
,keitaro1,2012-07-10T19:35Z,"I downloaded this torrent, and could find no Oblivion.iso file. I was able to run the setup.exe from the Oblivion folder, the load up screen runs, but I cannot play past the launcher. Any advice?"
,keitaro1,2012-07-13T21:34Z,Never mind. I didn't realize that the winrar file was the iso. Great share.
