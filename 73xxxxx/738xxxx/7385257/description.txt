==================================================================================
Huge Note:

-Make sure that after you mounted and have installed the Shivering Isles Add-on, that you re-mount the 'Oblivion.iso' so the note is.. DO NOT DELETE 'OBLIVION.ISO'
AFTER INSTALLATION!
-Make sure you read all directions to avoid error or confusion
-Only fret about instructions ^_^ They all have a instruction file for each program..
-Before you mess with the construction set.. make sure you know what you are doing... 
-After installation of Oblivion make sure you patch before using the Construction Ser and Shivering Isles..
-Use Daemon Tools Lite for all you're mounting and un-mounting needs.. (Easiest if you ask me)
