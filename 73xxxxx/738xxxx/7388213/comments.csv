Only one issue, when using the patch, it works perfect but the brightness setting in blaze keeps decreasing on it's own, almost like a ghost is pulling it down. I tried with the trial version and the brightness stays where you set it. Something in the patch. Any idea how I can rectify this? Anyways, thanks again bro for your hard work and awesome sharing I truly appreciate it man. "
