XBMC Ready: Firefly (Complete Series) in 480p (DVDRip) prepared by DonkeyHodey

SPECIAL NOTE: These are not original rips by me.  These are the best rips I could find online by other individuals, renamed/reorganized and prepared for immediate insertion into the Media Center Solution of your choice (I recommend XBMC.)

I spend a lot of time downloading a variety of torrents, picking and choosing from each to find what I believe to be the overall best digital options for these fine movies and television shows, and now I figured I can do what little I can to give back by presenting them fully-ready for XBMC, MediaPortal, Plex, Boxee, etc.

Unfortunately, over the years, I haven't preserved the original uploader information, so I can't provide credit where it's due for the amazing work these folks have done.

This is my first torrent.  I've chosen this because of it's small size.  If it is popular, I will add the remainder of my 22TB collection to re-share with the world, many or which are shows or old movies that don't have living torrents anymore.

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy.
