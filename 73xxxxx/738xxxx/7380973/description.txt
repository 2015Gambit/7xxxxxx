"Who should pay for your healthcare?"

[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

The Supreme Court will probably rule on Obamacare Monday.

On our show tonight, Fox News Legal Analyst Lis Wiehl tells us what to expect. The most reliable predictor of the future, Intrade.com, says the mandate is likely to be overturned. But what happens next? What about the rest of Obamacare?

Dr. Manisha Sharma from "Doctors for America" and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (and author of the new Independent Institute book, Priceless) debate government's role in healthcare.

Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a general surgeon from Arizona, argues government healthcare, even without Obamacare, already makes your doctor's visit look like a trip to the veterinarian.

But isn't "free" healthcare a good thing? Investor Cliff Asness explains the myths about "free" stuff.

Karen Harned with the National Federation of Independent Businesses and small business owner Joe Olivo explain how Obamacare--and other laws that kick in once a business employs 50 people--encourages small businesses to stay small. That kills jobs.

Finally, I'll talk about how popular parts of Obamacare, like the ban on insurance companies' discriminating against people with pre-existing condition, are as destructive as the mandate.
