,Flyer_10,2012-06-26T20:07Z,"Cant move here, seems to be a lot of people with the same problem, it also resets the key mapping and asks to create a new name every time the game is run."
,RMJ113,2012-06-26T20:17Z,unplug your CONTROLLER should fix that issue!
,R4G333,2012-06-26T20:29Z,Anybody knows how to get more FP? I meet sys requirements but It's really choppy for me.
,crazelunatic,2012-06-26T20:31Z,don't know if this fixes the device is hung error...... How can we check to see if this patch installed successfully to our version of grfs? What should the # read @ the top of the main menu screen if your running 1.1?
,LaNPaRtY1987,2012-06-26T20:52Z,same fps bug!
,LaNPaRtY1987,2012-06-26T20:52Z,this is not fix :(
,boneofweed,2012-06-26T21:02Z,"Mouse issue:
Start the game without any controller+receiver plugged

if you have a logitech G13 it's the same thing, you connect the controller after the games starts
after that if you quit the game you gonna have to restart windows and do the same that i say before "
,Ravenduz,2012-06-26T21:33Z,"For all you people, who are facing the bloody (device is hung) problem, I was facing the same problem, I think, it's solved now: what you have to do is to raise your GPU voltage. To do that you have to install ""MSI after burner"" run the program and follow the following:

1. press setting button ( located on the right bottom corner of main program window )..

2. on the setting window, check the two boxes of both a) Unlock voltage control AND b) Unlock voltage monitoring. press ok.

3. now you can adjust the voltage of your GPU, by clicking the slider ""it's just below the Core Voltage (mV)"".

it seems that the required voltage to fix the problem are 1050 or 1100, depends on you GPU, I've seen some videos on the web showing that the default voltage would be 1025 (on gtx580), funny thing is that my GPU is also (gtx580) but for some reason its default voltage was 1065, maybe because it is overclocked, maybe it depends on the subvendor mine is Asus, anyway, I set the voltage to 1100 and so far the game is running with no ""hung"" anymore, at least it didn't happen where it was happening before.

hey, since you are tweaking already it's good to go and configure your GPU fan options, press setting again, and check the fan tab, the set you fan curve, to you desirable options, it's not a mandatory thing, but I've reading that raising the voltage would cause the GPU to overheat, so it's better be safe than sorry.

hope this would solve your problem, thanks uploaders for your work. but please next time try to check the games on different rigs, lately most of the cracked games are having many stability problems, but thanks again for your hard work.

Cheers."
,Pakundo,2012-06-26T21:34Z,"On the ""upside"" installing this patch and applying the crack that comes along with this torrent has deleted all my progress save for my actual autosave, and so I am forced to the 12th and last mission with a Goblin and a T45.

CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
Too bad all my challenges are now erased, though."

,RMJ113,2012-06-27T03:40Z,"DEVICE HUNG = UNPLUG YOUR CONTROLLER!

there is no reason to overclock anything! 

that is just stupid!"
,SergioFCPorto,2012-06-27T06:56Z,thanks

,Ravenduz,2012-06-27T08:19Z,"@RMJ113, If you don't know what you're talking about, there's no need to post anything, I don't have a controller!!! 
And for all of you people who have the problem of (device is hung); game freezes, green diamond pattern shown on the screen, then crash. raise your GPU voltage. for people who have controller, and think it's the problem, well..if it's help, unplug it..suit yourself.."
,mons061,2012-06-27T08:22Z,"@RMJ113,
 I had no controller pluged and had the device hung ...message.
Increasing my GPU voltage solved the issue so when you don't know about something,don't talk.Ty."
