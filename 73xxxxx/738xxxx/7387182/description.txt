Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, June 25 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the firestorm that has ensued following the placement of Army troops and combat vehicles on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri. The corporate media is now praising the act as a response to crime and are featuring propaganda of residents who approve of the brazen move that flies in the face of warnings by the founders against standing armies and tyranny. 

Alex also talks with anti-Agenda 21 and smart meter opponent activist Deborah Tavares.
