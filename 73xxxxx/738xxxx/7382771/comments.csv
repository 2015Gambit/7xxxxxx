[V],blaze69,2012-06-25T21:23Z,"@ ZombieHadouken

It's Seems The Installer Is A custom Installer Created By RELOADED.

Do as nebxd1 Said and Disable antivirus before Installing.

Looks like some antivirus is blocking the installer from copying the File. Don't worry. It's just a false Positive."

[V],blaze69,2012-06-26T15:27Z,"@ guy686
You Didn't Disable Your antivirus Properly.

The Problem Is Occuring Because most antivirus Is flagging the File CDDrive/GameFiles/LEGOBatman2.exe 

http://www.postimg.com/74000/photo-73619.jpg  This is weird Considering that this file is the original file and not the cracked one. Try Creating a A folder On your desktop. Copy everything from the Disk To that folder, When Ur antivirus pops Up . Just ignore It. Then take the cracked LEGOBatman2.exe from the crack folder and Place It in The GameFiles folder, Then Run the installer. when u are done, just play"
,Pharsys,2012-06-26T18:44Z,"Well peeps i took my sweet time and tryin to figure out what may be the problem for me:

-After correct install and cracking i get an error that says it is made for a 32 bit system
-Few reinstalls still the same
-Checked the paths the compatibility and all the usual fails but nothing helps.

I can only assume that this version is not 64 bit friendly pls confirm it or help me to get it right..."
,marvinsuggs,2012-06-26T18:47Z,I am getting the same error as guy686 (Error reading file G:GameFiles__DISC__). Antivirus doesn't seem to have anything to do with it as I tried even completely uninstalling my antivirus and still got the error.
,Sheogoraz,2012-06-26T21:33Z,"@marvinsuggs & guy686

It took me a while to figure this shit out, I think it might help you (I had the same problem with the installation and that method worked for me, s'all I can say) :

- Right Click on My Computer and choose properties from the drop down menu
- Click on the tab that says device manager
- Click on the + to the left of CDROM in the list of devices
- Double click on the virtual CDrom drive under there
- Click on the Settings tab
- Uncheck DMA if it is already checked (if you have this option available)
- Click ""ok"" and restart your computer
- Install your game
- ???
- Profit"

It's in French and I have Windows XP, but I think it's the same shit for an English version of Vista / 7.
Maybe your virtual drive won't have the same name as mine, so you'll have to find out which one's the one Daemon Tools created for ya.

Windows XP SP3 32-bit as I said, and I have Deamon Tools Pro Advanced 4.41 for mounting. The Pro Advanced has some extra tricks to make games install smoothly, like virtual IDE drive etc. Pehaps try this version if you have not got it already? :-)  Just remember to install as administrator.

It is (should be) a standard routine to always have latest version of: 
A: Display Drivers
B: Directx
C: Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1
D: Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1
E: Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1
