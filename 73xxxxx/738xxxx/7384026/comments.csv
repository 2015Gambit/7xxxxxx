The only problem is that i can play the songs on my computer but when I attempt to play them on my iPod, they won't play.
they just cut off in the beginning.
i have an iPod classic, is that the problem?"
,BroHawk,2012-07-22T07:48Z,@jawb0ne I wouldn't know as I am not an iPod expert. I have all of the songs on my phone (Android) and they play perfectly. You should ask a tech person you know for help because it would be resolved much quicker in person than via online troubleshooting.
