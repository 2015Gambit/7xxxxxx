,YakovH,2012-07-09T05:05Z,Was this imported from a CD or converted from MP3 to FLAC? The quality is listed as 320 kbps in the description. That doesn't strike me as lossless.
,Emiroda,2012-07-10T23:59Z,"@YakovH: The logs from Exact Audio Copy (the .txt) seems fairly legit.
Seems real to me."
,tzeiggi,2012-07-16T07:29Z,"I copied the info from 320 release on what.cd, it's legit FLAC with 100% EAC"
