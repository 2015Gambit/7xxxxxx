You cast your own reflection in the sky.  If you can attribute the majesty of our Universe to god's creation, is it not possible that he created many kingdoms, and has many children?  Your holy scripture may not say so, but perhaps your God has you on a need-to-know basis... that would certainly explain how his words require so much of your ""interpretation."""
[T],POtHS11,2012-06-25T19:09Z,Take the Words literally and there is no need for interpretation. He does exist. If you were not chosen you must seek him out. It is free will and faith. Many have seen him.
