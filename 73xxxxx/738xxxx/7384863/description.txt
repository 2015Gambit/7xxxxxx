Melissa Stylianou is a new name to me, yet ΓÇ£Silent MovieΓÇ¥ (Anzic Records) is her fourth recording and itΓÇÖs a winner by all measures, from the program of songs to the hues of emotion, made musical and colored brightly by her amazing band. Her liner notes reveal that evoking a mood, a place or a memory is foremost on StylianouΓÇÖs mind, and in that respect I am reminded of Joni MitchellΓÇÖs early records since StylianouΓÇÖs style of singing suggests Mitchell as well.
