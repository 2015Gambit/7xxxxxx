Maybe only niggers, chinks, wops, kikes and wetbacks dont like him because he was quite a racist, but if you leave that aside, he was great. He was a shy, old-fashioned dude who didnt hate anybody individually, only as a throng in slums. I have in print EVERYTHING he ever wrote, a lifetime of buying."
