    Living in a Chawl in India, Arjun Dixit    
    decides to become rich. He gets involved in
    gambling, and soon becomes a bookie.       
    His quest takes him to Cape Town, South    
    Africa, where he meets with Zoya and both  
    fall in love. She disapproves of his       
    so-called career, but Arjun disregards     
    her concerns. Arjun does not know that     
    soon he will be arrested, but quickly      
    released with the help of an underworld    
    gangster, Abu Ibrahim, who has plans       
    for Arjun. These plans include cricket     
    match-fixing and Arjun's greed will make   
    him go to any lengths to make as much      
    money as possible in a very short span     
    of time.
