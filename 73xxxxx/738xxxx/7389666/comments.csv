Sadly, American Imperialism is even worse than the filthy English Colonialism. But those Spanish cockroaches were pretty evil too, at least they are now were they belong - bankrupt and in the pocket of the Germans."

Agree or Disagree with the content. It's knowledge."

,raenkae,2012-09-09T02:17Z,"Nice collections. I would also like some books on the arab colonisations and slave trade in Africa, Persia, India and Indonesia. moman73, can you get those for me? The true knowledge shall set the world free, and show every tyrant in the light of day!

The people of eastern Asia have gone through so much problems with colonial masters as the brits, germans, arabs, french, spanish and so on. Each with their set of tyranny, drugs and indoctrination."
