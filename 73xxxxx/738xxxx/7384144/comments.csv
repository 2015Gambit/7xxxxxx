,keif8,2012-06-25T05:01Z,"Once again, big thanks for uploading all of this Footy.  A/V 10/10.

And i completely agree.  Such an exciting season so far.  Especially compared to last year.  Not only are the previous top drivers on a level field but also drivers like Maldonado, Perez, Grosjean are now a threat.  It's great stuff.  Cheers. :)
