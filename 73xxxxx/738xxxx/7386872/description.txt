Richmond, Virginia's Battlemaster (US) released this demo as part of a winter tour in early 2010 with Locusta from Columbus, Ohio. The first two tracks are also featured on a split EP with another Richmond band, Inter Arma. Described often as "blackened death metal" among plenty of other things along those lines with a tongue-in-cheek lyrical focus on Dungeons & Dragons and all this fantastical and otherworldly. They are currently (June-July, 2012) recording their second full-length album due out later in 2012.
