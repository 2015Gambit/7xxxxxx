,Bak2Jak,2012-06-24T05:03Z,"I wonder if all the people who complain about no seeds when the torrent was uploaded literally 10 minutes ago are impatient or retarded or both. I can clearly picture them planting a watermelon seed in a garden, covering it with soil, watering it, then immediately screaming at it like a chimp ""WHY NO WATERMELONS?!"""
