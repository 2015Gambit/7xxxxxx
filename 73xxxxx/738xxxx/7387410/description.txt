PLOT: Vanilla Sky is a 2001 American science fiction thriller film directed, co-produced and co-written by Cameron Crowe.

The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz (in a repeat of her performance in Abre los ojos) and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell. Vanilla Sky has been described as "an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp",[2] "part Beautiful People fantasy, part New Age investigation of the Great Beyond,"[3] a "love story and a struggle for the soul,"[4] and an "erotic adventure, romance, mystery, and psychological thriller, with a dose of science fiction."
