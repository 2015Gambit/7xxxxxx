Need this so bad"
,pscivil,2012-06-23T18:59Z,By the way do you usually upload this onto irc as well?
,Toemme,2012-06-23T19:00Z,why did this even take so long?
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T19:01Z,"we're seeding from two computers/ips, dw :)"
,graazil,2012-06-23T19:02Z,I'll be seeding it for a while!
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T19:02Z,"no irc. we're noobs/not true scene so we don't have all that

@Toemme our computers are shit. we were surprised nobody beat us..."
,killbat,2012-06-23T19:06Z,All these hit and runs and no one can seed this greedy assholes
,Senzaxamore,2012-06-23T19:07Z,Please seed! Have been waiting for this all week! When done I'll keep seeding it.

,mrnightmare114,2012-06-23T19:16Z,ill start seeding when it dowloads ~.~
,heff17,2012-06-23T19:16Z,any chance you could package all the episodes into one torrent? that's be awesome.
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T19:17Z,"y'all gotta be patient...700+ peers with only 2 seeds is gonna take a while until y'all are able to download the full site.

if you don't wanna wait, we've got cyberlocker links up on our site"
,airbenderrr,2012-06-23T19:17Z,i'm just waiting for a 720p version of this...

[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T19:21Z,"btw in case you haven't realised, seed stats on here are incorrect"
,airbenderrr,2012-06-23T19:23Z,why are the comments so weird on this page?
,glyphie,2012-06-23T19:23Z,AMON KILLS DUMBLEDORE

,renrutal,2012-06-23T19:36Z,"Try doing MKVs next time, at least it can be watched streamed while downloading."
,renrutal,2012-06-23T19:37Z,"Oh, BTW, thank you!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T19:38Z,"@airbenderrr weird how? take a while to appear?

@dato_ts no it's not fake...why would we do that? we've got a trusted skull for a reason

@mrnightmare114 be patient, that's usually the case for new torrents with tons of peers and only a handful of seeders

just finished seeding 100% to many, will continue for a while :)"
,JtotheL,2012-06-23T19:39Z,"Thanks a lot, uploader!
Can't wait to see it.

The quality is so/so, but it's a tv rip so that's to be expected. However, the picture lags a bit for me, and I think it's in the file, because I don't have that problem with any other file I play, no matter the resolution.

But if you really NEEEEEED to se it (like I do), this is the one to go for."
,Mousey350,2012-06-23T19:40Z,Thanks so much. You are the first one to have it up  =D
,alinot,2012-06-23T19:41Z,"Torrent seems fine.
a 10
v 6 (not HD, but that's what you get for an early release tv-rip).

Download took ages but I was an early comer.  If you're downloading an hour or two after the initial upload you should get it pretty quickly."
,vezal3500,2012-06-23T19:41Z,"The quality isnt amazing, but its enough for me to get my fix until an hd torrent comes out. Thanks alot for the upload!"
,SignZ,2012-06-23T19:48Z,"Sweet, can't wait for it to finish downloading. :)
Too bad the season ends already."
,365220,2012-06-23T19:48Z,">downloading slowly
>mfw set uploading to 1kb
>mfw now downloading at 500kb"
,Redistrust,2012-06-23T19:51Z,"A - 8/10
V - 7/10

I don't know if it was just me or not, but the video was pretty choppy. I'm just going to wait for 720p."
,Earl96,2012-06-23T19:52Z,So this is both episodes?
,Earl96,2012-06-23T19:58Z,"Also, since you mentioned it yeah comments don't ever show on any torrents for me til I post a new one. 
And personally to me, as long as it wasn't like recorded with a camera or something it's as good to me as anything else. 
Last thing, I'll try to seed for about a month. That's enough for like a 32 share ratio on my slow uploading. "
,Earl96,2012-06-23T20:00Z,"Actually, make that 64. xD Sorry for posting so many comments. lol"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T20:01Z,@Earl96 yes this is both (hence e11-12)
,rletor,2012-06-23T20:14Z,"A - 8
V - 5

Really bad video, works on xbox. Waiting on a better release before I watch the episode."
,Blackice709,2012-06-23T20:37Z,How come I have no sound?
,uwotm8,2012-06-23T20:44Z,Can someone who's filled in the survey and got the password post it?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-23T20:52Z,"Mrunpopular just wanted to to tell you that i uploaded your torrent to various other sites left the name and everything how it is, gave you credit.
My version wont be up for a while, Busy with stuff, and alot of people are beasting for these 2 episodes so i had no choice but to give them yours.
your seeds should jump another1-2K in the next hour."
,AzeXi,2012-06-23T20:53Z,Waiting for 720p
,uwotm8,2012-06-23T20:56Z,"alright people, the file is password protected, but here it is: 739552

,solidhy,2012-06-23T22:10Z,how can i help the seeds??
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-23T22:28Z,"@uwotm8 fuck off, there's no password. stop with your shit spam.

@Blackice709 dunno. do you have the right codecs? others play it fine...

@Daman4Iife sweet, thanks. I was rather surprised you or sec hadn't uploaded anything before me, I was constantly refreshing while my computer slowly encoded this ep lol"
,jwojchi,2012-06-23T22:44Z,"The 720's are available now, let's move along.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7380627/The.Legend.of.Korra.S01E12.Endgame[720p][Secludedly]"
,Hirtch,2012-06-23T23:11Z,problem is the 720p requires a password that so far has been withheld even upon meeting the requirements to unlocking the password.
[T],MrDowntown,2012-06-24T02:11Z,"LEGIT.

I have no idea where season 2 will go - glad there is one - Im invested in EVERY character"
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-24T02:15Z,"Yeah, I dozed off into dreamland so my shit was uploaded late. That's what happens when you drink and fall asleep 2 hours before the show airs. lol. Good job on this up, man."
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-24T02:18Z,"And PS: There's no password on this, or mine. Stop being spamming cockslaps to us."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-24T02:45Z,"@Sec Hah, no worries. Thanks. Even if you or someone else beat me (by a small margin at least) I'd have uploaded anyway, but I was rather surprised that I was first, especially being an hour after the episode finished. (gotta love using a really slow and old computer, eh?) So I went ahead and uploaded what I can offer. ^^"
,davexd,2012-06-24T02:53Z,"thanks ,i just cant believe that the 1st serie only have 12 episodes , if this is the last episode"
,cxcharlie,2012-06-24T04:34Z,You're the best Mr. Unpopular! Excited for season 2. 
,BlackandBad,2012-06-24T13:29Z,"cropped a little, totally watchable.... is this the last episode this season ?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-24T14:43Z,"@BlackandBad Yes this is the season finale.

Only the black bars are cropped, since it airs in 16:9 letterbox on SD channel"
,JoelisaH,2012-06-24T18:40Z,Thank you +1
,dlightz2,2012-06-25T01:05Z,BEST ANIME SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!! WHEN DOES SEASON 2 BEGIN?????
,dlightz2,2012-06-25T01:12Z,Season 2 is suppose to begin early 2013. :(
,dlightz2,2012-06-25T01:12Z,"Also great job MrUnpopular! i really enjoyed your torrents, thank you so much!"
,Saeras,2012-06-26T15:20Z,This password thing is seriously annoying. Wat do.
,kubrick,2012-07-21T14:56Z,"Poor video and audio quality, look elsewhere."
