Click is about a young pretty housewive, Claudia Christiani, who is frigid to the point of being chronically averse to the mere mention of sex. A family "friend" steals a device, that can turn her sex drive on at will, and star to use this to humiliate her for rejecting him. This version is the new french colour edition, with an amazing new colour scheme.
