  Resident Evil 2 (Claire's Disc) : Dual Shock version -- converted to run on the Sony Xperia Play. Full controls, Analog mode IS WORKING on the Xperia Play Analog touchpad. If you want to use it, press menu/controller settings/assign buttons/ and choose type 4, *5 or 6.
  Glitches during some cutscenes but otherwise this works great on my R800x! Game wil exit the first time it's run. Run it again and it should work.
  You can try to get the onscreen controls working on your phone by looking @ /Android/Data/com.sony.playstation.[Title ID]/files/ucc/.../preferences.xml in a text editor.
Enjoy!
