Tools > Track Synchronization

Set Audio to -4.500 Should be Perfect :)"
,MJimM,2012-07-06T21:36Z,"@TeamDark Thanks for the info on the audio sync, much appreciated. I was scratching my head and thought perhaps I'd had a few too many beers when the lips didn't match the word! â&#x2DC;ş"
,halfnekojames,2012-07-16T06:35Z,i have tried adjusting the time ratio on vlc to the mentioned and it is still terrible.  I continued to try and adjust it through the show and a couple times i got almost perfect and as the show continued on it went right back to being screwed up.. not only is the audio completely out of sync its all over the place so you cant get a lock on a good number to fix it. as much as i wanted to watch these episodes because i missed them this has been a terrible experience with Crazy's release here.  First and last time.
