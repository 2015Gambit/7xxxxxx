SUMMARY......: Original Air Date 06/25/2012, Documentary, Performance, Science
Nik attempts to cheat death by climbing inside a box filled with dynamite and re-create a high wire walk that killed his great-grandfather; the team reverse-engineers a deadly stunt with the high hopes of success and not a repeat of history.

RELEASE NOTES: For some reason the title changed from "Danger by Design" to "Nik Wallenda's Beyond Niagra". That's a mouthful and sounds awful. Sticking with "Danger by Design" as that is the original title for the series.
