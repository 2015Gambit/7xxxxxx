The film was made by people who love making movies, and funded mostly by ourselves, family & friends.  It was made on a very small budget – a truly “independent” film.  Sadly, it’s become incredibly difficult for independent filmmakers to make their money back on their films nowadays, and that’s certainly true for us.

If you enjoy the film and would like to support us, I’d like to ask that you please consider buying a copy on DVD when it’s released (July 17 in the US & Canada – we don’t know dates for any other countries yet).  Or, you could also donate to us directly via Paypal, at our email address: midnightsonmovie@yahoo.com

Thanks, and enjoy the movie!"
