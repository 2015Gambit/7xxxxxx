WORKDONE:

OK took the poo russian camrip,rotated slightly,pulled some sides out,resized and then filtered the video ....
and then hey presto .....still POO lmfao.
Anyway only reason for doing this is because there is nothing else going on and SOMEONE might want it lol..
Audio we had too clean and sync ....had to shrink the audio as it was 5mins runtime difference then it was dam close.Just
needed stretching back a little and now its 99.9% in sync.
Video was missing 2 secs only ....and the sync is pretty much bang on nbut due too the darkness in nsome parts and some auto
focus issues is was a tad hard in parts and had to reply on sounds from doors shutting etc...too line it up.

Anyway ....you've been warned...this copy is pretty poo around.
IMHO V4 A4 .....
