Disclaimer!

This is a bootleg recording and, other than the fact it was recorded in London in 2003, I have no other details to give (venue, precise date, etc). However I do know that the sound quality is brilliant and that there shouldn't be any complaints.

Enjoy, and don't forget to learn how to upload. Seeding alone doesn't contribute to the community.
