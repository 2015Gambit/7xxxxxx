This is the complete Beethoven piano sonata cycle played by Daniel Barenboim on the DG label. It was ripped to flac ( compression level 8 ) in ultra secure mode then verified with dBpoweramp. There is another set on these going around, but that had some pops and clicks in the audio. Hopefully this one by me should be perfect.

enjoy and seed!
