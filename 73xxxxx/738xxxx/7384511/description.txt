Note: straight forward reencode of T.R.M release very nice work guys jus did
a likkle bit to this mainly worked on the noise a likkle on the colours etc
came out pretty nice, this does still have 23mins of the old video with the
flicker but the majority of the film 1hour 34mins is the new source from T.R.M
soo no flicker overall very nice indeed, HOPE you Enjoy

Note2: the first 3mins is quite bad but settles nd the cam has some focusing
issues now and again
