Masterchef Season 4 Episode 45

With this yearΓÇÖs MasterChef format geared towards accenting these characters and the way their food reflects who they are, audience favourites like the Mystery Box Challenge and Invention Test are back and better than ever. What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?

It wouldnΓÇÖt be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonΓÇÖs hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world ΓÇô the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!

Tonight - Week 8 - Tuesday - Rum and raisin is a classic combination, but will it be a perfect match for our contestant in the Immunity Challenge? Chef Daniel Wilson also joins the kitchen. 

Enjoy!
