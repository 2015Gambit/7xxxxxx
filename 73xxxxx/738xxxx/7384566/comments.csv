The original which was in Russian and was called Likvidator I think."

..............................and...............................it's English subtitled. "
[T],Djofullinn,2012-06-30T20:53Z,"It´s a Kazakh film and the audio is Russian. According to a Russian guy I know, the English subtitles are quite adequate.

Since Vinnie Jones´s Russian would be atrocious his character, what little is of it, is The Mute. 

This is standard fare. An anti-hero. Vengeance. A sympathetic cop in a currupt system. It´s good to get rid of the criminals but it has to be done ""legally"". You know the drill. Six out of ten."
[T],Djofullinn,2012-06-30T21:29Z,"P.S. Now I see that the director is going to do Warriors of the Steppe, which looks interesting to me being an admirer of the mongol warriors. And apparently he´s gonna get a much bigger budget.  Definitely gonna download that one. "
