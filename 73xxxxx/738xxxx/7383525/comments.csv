,s4xon,2012-06-25T23:15Z,Thanks for this.  I only wish the 1st series was in 16:9 720p.  Amazing writing and storyline in both.  Cheers!

Nice quality and there is no nick logo during the eps. Only a nick intro before them."
,massarico,2012-09-17T14:39Z,Spoke too soon. I think there's logo from ep 5 but it doesnt detract from the quality.
