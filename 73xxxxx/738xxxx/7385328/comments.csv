[T],xgimpyx,2012-06-26T06:44Z,"Some are calling this season 3, however, both trutv and tvrage are still numbering them as season 2. If trutv changes their numbering then so will I. "
[T],iamgreat,2012-06-28T03:25Z,"gimpy, if it makes it any easier Turner's press site does list this as being season 2. truTV's website is heavily focused on video and somewhat hidden there they have incomplete episode guides. 

gimpy if you are WRCR then you might want to correct one release in particular. The pilot from 18 Jan 11 was released from the repeat on 9  Aug 11 and was numbered as s01e09. When the correction for the latter 13 from 2011-12 was done it resulted in two episodes labelled s01e09, the pilot and ""Old Rivals, New Wars"" wherein the Taylor brothers come to California. "

Thanks for pointing out the pilot. I wish more people would understand that I only go by what the official website numbers them. When they took the break last year and then came back is when the season 2 confusion started. Lizard Lick Towing is the same way."
