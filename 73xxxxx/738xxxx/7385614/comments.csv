,plsad,2012-09-01T18:52Z,"May i ask something? I follow the steps and everything seems fine. It says that update is not necessary- the virus data base is up to date. BUT if i try to update nevertheless it asks for a user name and password! Is that the way it's supposed to be working?

Next to ""Licence valid until"" it shows nothing and next to ""Licence type"" it shows ""OEM"".

As i said i installed the programm, restarted in safe mode and then run the fix and clicked ""Enable"". Then restarted again the computer.

Did i do something wrong? Is this the way it's supposed to be? Asking for username and code when i try to manually try to update?"
