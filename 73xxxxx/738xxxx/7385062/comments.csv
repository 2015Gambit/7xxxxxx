,speriasw,2012-07-02T01:07Z,its getting stuck at 93.3....there are no one seeding :(
,Danimal1q2w3,2012-07-02T03:58Z,"I'm seeding, but my upstream is only 200kbps and ive been watching people hit and run this for a week. Nobody cares to seed:/"

Unfortunately the resolution is 960x720, not 1280x720, so it looks square rather then wide.
Seeding now.."
