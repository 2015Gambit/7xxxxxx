,fernandodunha,2012-06-24T19:04Z,"Thank's All for support. 

We have some delay between IPAD and PC version because the file size or other factors involved.

But don't worry, maybe we can get it in a few days.

Don't forget to rating my files.
Thanks."
,disagreeable,2012-06-24T21:07Z,Thanks!
,JWRBlack,2012-06-24T21:31Z,"For PC users who can't wait for the update: There is a way to use files from the IPAD to partially update the PC version.
Out of this torrent take the files airports.dbf, charts.ini charts.bin (DocumentsDataTermcharts).
Rename airports.dbf to Airports.dbf and charts.bin to Charts.bin.
Copy these 3 files to your JeppesenCommonTerminalCharts folder on your pc to replace the older versions.
This will already update the terminal charts to the current version while we wait for the full Pc update."

,Mazagar,2012-06-25T14:38Z,"Hello,

I have just instaled JeppFD on my iPad then the Cycle 1213.
Impossible to see terminal charts.
I have this message : ""Chart Library Problem. The requested chart is not in the library. (...)""

I did the same with JeppTC (with only TermCharts in Document folder) with same error.

Help Please
Please help"
,precursor1188,2012-06-26T07:02Z,"@mazagar.
For TC, copy everything under Termcharts into the Documents. i.e. there is no Termcharts folder.
For FD, copy the folder termcharts and all contents to Data folder i.e Data-TermCharts."
,Mazagar,2012-06-26T09:41Z,"Thank you precursor1188,
I did exactly that without success.
I used iTunes to transfer zip folders (or files for TC) from PC to iPad then iFile to transfer zip in suitable emplacement then I unzip.
All folders (files) are in good emplacement but it still not working..."
,precursor1188,2012-06-26T10:09Z,"@mazagar
Perhaps you can try iExplorer or iFunbox to copy-delete-create the folder-files to ipad FD & TC folders. Both works with jb or non-jb ipad. They are freeware. Just google and u get them."
,Mazagar,2012-06-26T11:10Z,"@precursor1188
I tried with iFunbox
That works perfectly!
Thank you very much :-)"

,cptS,2012-06-29T13:12Z,"2joseph71   For W7 No problem sir: A). Open 1213 iP. B). From the folder ""Date / TermCharts"" copy 2 files, 1st ""charts. bin"" (size 530,081 KB). and the 2nd ""charts.ini (size 1KB). C). In the first file, change the small letter "" c "" for a large ""C "". D). Finally, these two files ("" Charts. bin ""and"" charts.ini "") to insert with the replacement to ""ProgramDate / Jeppesen / Common / TerminalCharts /.               Computer restart is not necessary.               Just enjoy it.        PS:    You can also update EnrouteData in FS."
