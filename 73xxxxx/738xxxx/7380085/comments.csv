,T.F.K,2012-06-23T20:37Z,"Look at our other uploads,this is legit,and pls dont troll."
,neverfindme,2012-06-24T05:35Z,"oh well... I'm not trolling... if you feel so, then I'm sorry.. :P I was really mad with latest fake torrents.                                                                 

I thought this was about to release on 26th as per the info from Amazon, wiki and official website of Ghost Recon but later I found it is released days before than expected date. 

ok, im downloading, let me see if this works :) Thanx for your time and efforts BTW."

,yohanz5,2012-06-30T08:05Z,"@alizainp

it does work without any issues on my 2 pc's & laptop. using 64bit win7. try to turn off your antivirus, each time you install. for ex, avg is very sensitive to false positive. it might be deleted in some no reason though."
