(Cheers GuYz) 

for a cam ( V - 7.5 A - 6.5 ) very watchable IMHO! :kiss:

Note: took along time with this cam as the
colours were very bad plus rainbow effect/
tint hurts the eyes, spent 23hours with dis
one, slight change in AR then on to the filters
gamma, sat, rgb, colour balance, Q1, contrast,
denoisers etc came out very nice check sample
check comparison's check vdub all is good, but
the cammer did cover the lens for the first 3
minutes no biggie, HOPE you Enjoy YEARD! 

Note2: No Fooking Complaining its free & basically 85% Rainbow 3 

Note3: doing a v2 of this soo u can wait or grab Enjoy
