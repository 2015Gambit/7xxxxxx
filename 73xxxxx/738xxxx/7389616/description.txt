Review by Ken Dryden (AMG):
Big-toned tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton leads a swinging small group session that concentrates mostly on songs that didn't receive much attention in the 1990s. "Answer Me (My Love)" is a potent ballad feature for the leader that reveals the influence of Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster, while Hamilton also has fun with lively riff tunes like his own "Rhythm Riff #127," and Hawkins' "Stuffy." Trumpeter Greg Gisbert is outstanding throughout the date, while trombonist Joel Helleny and guitarist Duke Robillard only appear on three tracks each, but make valuable contributions with their solos. This delightful CD stands up well to repeated listening, and is one of Scott Hamilton's best recordings.
