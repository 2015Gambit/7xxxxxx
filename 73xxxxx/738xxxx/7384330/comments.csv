I tried updating the software to see if it would fix this (I know) but it just breaks it even more, although the patch still works."
,BCampz,2012-06-25T05:41Z,"awesome release, thanks alot. no instructions but you have to fully install before you patch, and yes you can update the version too.

Not quite sure what licences it has but appears to have all of them. might be mistaken on this"
,gendef,2012-06-25T06:44Z,"except after you update the ""target platform"" dropdown box is blank and won't let you run or compile your game at all"
,SSJASON,2012-06-25T11:03Z,I don't have that issue. After updating even I can compile in all platforms and demo the games.
,gendef,2012-06-25T22:45Z,"That's weird, sorry I must have done something wrong, here's what I tried:

1. Installed GMS with the included installer in the torrent
2. Opened GMS to let it complete the installation
3. Closed GMS when it asked for license and ran Patch.exe (said ""Patched Successfully"")
4. Target box is blank, can create games but they won't run
5. Updated GMS and ran the patch again
6. Same deal

Is there something that I'm missing or doing wrong?"
,SSJASON,2012-06-25T23:23Z,Hmmm I don't know. thats weird. uninstall and try again installing as admin. you should be able to compile in android even and thats a premium site feature.
,NugShow,2012-06-27T03:20Z,"I can't figure this out either. I've installed the basic app and it patches fine, but regardess of patched or unpatched, admin or not admin, the updated version leaves a blank Target box. I've tried to install this on another 64 bit system to no avail. Any help?"
,SSJASON,2012-06-27T10:41Z,I am working on a patch for the latest version since i get them right away since i own this legit.

In the version you posted you can test play your games for all of the target platforms, but exporting had not been implemented yet. You can update safely to the latest version where exporting should be enabled, but those modules simply haven't been cracked yet. If you find a way to update to the last version of the beta, I think they allowed exporting but with watermarks.

Looks like we're just going to have to wait for someone to crack 1.0.198, not 1.0.98"
,anotherdler,2012-06-28T07:31Z,"Thx for this app.

But I want to go with something else - does anyone have a full version of Construct 2 (r95) - the one with all features included?????"

Go to the site and have fun. "
,shinoxg,2012-07-24T05:38Z,"So, what happens if I try to actually publish an android or iOS game I made with the cracked version? Any way of them finding out? I was actually planning on buying it, but I don't want to buy it unless i'm 100% sure I can make revenue with it"
,sasuke32150,2012-07-31T00:41Z,The patch will not open.
,Greylore,2012-08-03T17:43Z,"This works!  I accidentally rated down, but I've been able to compile angry cats to html5 on this!"
