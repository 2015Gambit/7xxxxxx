,Kikee_31,2012-06-28T07:12Z,"Funny title, think i'll give this one a go. TY scene4all.

@scene4all; R horror movies all u usually do? Just curious cuz i haven't seen ur name at all until this past week or 2 and now ur all over the Top 100 with all horror flicks, (and all ones i've never heard of). If this IS your thing then u probably have a few GOOD Zombie titles i havent seen. I'd b so grateful if u could think of any (and maybe even post a link or 2). Its just that it's gettin real hard to find any good Zombie movies i havent yet seen no matter where i look.  Thanks 2 U or anyone who feels like suggesting a title! (:I'm sure i may get a different suggestion from some wise-cracker out there for my probably annoying request.  Anyway, Thanks again!! "

,ole_olsen32,2012-07-10T00:04Z,"@drunk-mon - Actually, John Landis dropped out, and Jack Perez ended up directing it.  It's still a pretty decent movie if you like horror-comedies.  "
,ole_olsen32,2012-07-10T00:07Z,"Sorry, Landis did get a producer credit.  My bad.  "
