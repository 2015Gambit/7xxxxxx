,SMMEHDI,2012-07-15T06:44Z,"ITS WORKED Very easy (Run game setup as Administrator> Regiser your account on ubinsoft
then it will ask for key >GO TO SETTING AND CHECK THE LAST OPTION OF ""LAUNCH UBIN IN OFF LINE MODE""> THEN AGAIN RUN THE GAME AS ADMIN DO NOT RECONNECT CLICK ON PLAY. Game will start
ENJOY....."
