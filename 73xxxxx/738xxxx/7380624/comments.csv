,koldarm,2012-06-23T23:12Z,"There is no .rar file. You dumbasses downloaded the fake torrent, not this one. No one has this one yet, because it hasn't finished initial seeding yet."
,le1chi,2012-06-23T23:12Z,Wtf is this password shit
,koldarm,2012-06-23T23:12Z,"In other words, if you came here looking for a password, you're a massive retard and you have a fake torrent, not this one."

,cor35vet,2012-06-23T23:23Z,"This is pure legit epicness!
There was a fake torrent around uploaded by anon, the real torrents always get uploaded by SecTPB. Stop whining!

And why is the aviablity on 43.3% for me :((
I am at ratio 4 now :o"
,Arcane_Ether,2012-06-23T23:26Z,"Torrent contents are Password locked and require you to ""Accept an Offer"" to receive password.

It's cheap attempt at farming cash from unsuspecting first-time downloaders.

Don't download!

Shame on you, Secludedly, bad pirate! Bad!"
,airbenderrr,2012-06-23T23:27Z,"Guys this is SecTPB it's obviously not password protected, don't listen to the dumbasses."

You're a fucking moron and you deserve everything you get."
,kittylitterbug,2012-06-23T23:45Z,Newb here.... How did the fake torrent get here and now the real one is in it's place? I'm confused. I'll be checking the torrent contents from now on though.
,Nemecis123,2012-06-23T23:49Z,SEED PLEASE :(
,koldarm,2012-06-23T23:50Z,"@kittylitterbug

That's not what happened. Someone put up a fake torrent, it was deleted, and then later, this one came up. People are confused and don't realize this because:

1. They can't read.
2. They're retarded.
3. It's their first time using the internet.
4. Any combination of the above 3."
,airbenderrr,2012-06-23T23:51Z,seed you bastards SEEEEEEED!!
,ambrood,2012-06-23T23:52Z,can somebody please seed?
,koldarm,2012-06-23T23:55Z,"Stop complaining about seeds, it just came out, it hasn't finished initial seeding yet. No one has this torrent finished yet."
,Rohank7,2012-06-23T23:56Z,"Please seed guys.. seed/peer = 0.076.

Can't wait to watch it.. and i'm getting like 4 kbps."

,firexninja,2012-06-24T00:02Z,thank you!
,cor35vet,2012-06-24T00:02Z,"Good explanation koldarm!
I'm at 80%!
Only less minutes until I can watch the pure epicness in a .mkv
Please stop posting shit about password in here. Just check the files before you download crap, noone would ever .rar a movie in torrents. And checking the uploading user doesn't hurt neither."
,Pipsqk,2012-06-24T00:10Z,"@koldarm You know, you CAN tell them calmly without acting like an asshole. 
There are no archives in this torrent; just an MKV file. If you need a password, then you grabbed a fake torrent, unfortunately. This, along with the other episode that was posted, is legit.
Keep up the good work Sec! :D"
,oko0806,2012-06-24T00:11Z,SecTPB! I made an account just to say Thanks bro. 
,koldarm,2012-06-24T00:19Z,"@Pipsqk

I prefer being an asshole."
,guisadop,2012-06-24T00:22Z,"There was some Anon earlier uploading some fake .rar torrents. It was an obvious attempt of fishing as   it was not uploaded by SecTPB. 
This, however, is legit. Thanks man, you rock."
,koldarm,2012-06-24T00:30Z,FINALLY finished initial seeding. Enjoy everyone.
,cptncptn,2012-06-24T00:33Z,"Seriously with the 60fps.  Way to damage traditional animation, folks.  I'll wait until the 24fps release."
,Scootaloo_42,2012-06-24T00:33Z,Finally 100 %. Let the real seeding frenzy begin.
,kittylitterbug,2012-06-24T00:50Z,"@koldarm

I just don't get how a fake torrent was 'linked' via this page and now a working one is in it's place. I guess I just don't understand how the torrent infrastructure works. Guess I'll be doing some reading up."
,Qajs1,2012-06-24T00:57Z,"Kinda sucks when my upload speed is uploading @ 500 kB/s and the download is 300 kB/s.

SEED people!!!"
,sharer1064,2012-06-24T01:00Z,"Thanks, thanks, thanks.."
,Qajs1,2012-06-24T01:02Z,"I'm seeding like hell, adding 500 kB/s to all peers connected, amazing quality and episode!"
,koldarm,2012-06-24T01:04Z,"@kittylitterbug

Read what I said again. No one 'linked via this page'. Before this torrent was posted, someone else put up a fake one. It stayed up for a few minutes, then got deleted. Then later, this torrent was posted. The people who downloaded the fake one are retarded and think they downloaded THIS torrent."
,dozycats,2012-06-24T01:13Z,"Quality is fantastic! Thanks once again.

Oh, and to those whining about it being 60fps, I can't see a difference between this and what I saw on TV. Maybe I'm just blind, though."
,paantsu,2012-06-24T01:20Z,"Aw come on people, seed! D:"
,leediv,2012-06-24T01:42Z,"I cried!
Awesome, awesome ending!"
,kittylitterbug,2012-06-24T01:43Z,"@koldarm

Hmmm... How come then people are complaining about the password issue in the comments on this torrent? Again, I think I'm missing something."
,RepThatCurry,2012-06-24T01:54Z,THIS IS SOO STUPID u need a password and have to do an entire survey to get password and watch vid i did the survey and still got nothing. im waiting for someone else to put one up
,10hellfire01,2012-06-24T02:01Z,"@kittylitterbug - Because the Anon one that was uploaded before had the same name as this one, so people were confused and thought this was the torrent they started downloading since the other is gone, when it was in fact the one that was deleted.

If people also paid attention to the name of the uploader, then this mess wouldn't happen."
,RepThatCurry,2012-06-24T02:01Z,"@PEOPLE WHO NEED PASSWORD

download it again worked for me"
,dozycats,2012-06-24T02:08Z,"@kittylitterbug

I'm a different person but I'll try to explain it a little better.

Earlier today (before THIS torrent was uploaded), a torrent was posted with this same title. People downloaded it thinking it was from SecTPB, but it wasn't. It was from an anonymous uploader. The file that they downloaded from THAT torrent contained a money making password survey thing. That torrent/post was deleted from this website, leaving people saying ""wtf"".

A few hours later, SecTPB uploads this. Now, because it has the same title as the fake scam one that was deleted earlier, people are commenting thinking it's the same torrent, but IT'S NOT. They don't know the other one was deleted, because the fake one and this legitimate one share the same title.


This is the legitimate Secludedly upload. I've downloaded both parts, and they work flawlessly."

,MalignantParadigm,2012-06-24T02:42Z,"There seems to be something wrong with the file. Whenever I come into contact with it in any way, even just trying to access the folder it's contained in, Windows Explorer freezes and restarts."
