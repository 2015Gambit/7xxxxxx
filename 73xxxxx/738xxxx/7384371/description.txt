What begins as friendship quickly blossoms into something deeper. Peyton tries to extricate herself before her heart wants what it canΓÇÖt have. Elena canΓÇÖt imagine not having Peyton in her life. And despite the fact that she has never even considered kissing a woman, Elena is overwhelmed with a desire to do just that. Despite PeytonΓÇÖs reservations, Elena pushes the relationship into a full-blown affair. The two women fall deeply in love, both keenly aware a future together might be little more than a dream.
