When you download a torrent after it's done downloading leave your computer on so the file continues uploading, till your ratio reaches at least 1, thats how torrents work otherwise the torrent dies and you'll have bad karma for life.

What happens if your hard drive crashes and you lose all your shit and you want to redownload the torrent but when you go to it it's dead because you didn't do your part and seed.

Do your part,
Seed or die.

PS. if you have very slow upload speed and know you can't seed it all back,please don't download this massive file, just download the individual courses you want from demonoid."
