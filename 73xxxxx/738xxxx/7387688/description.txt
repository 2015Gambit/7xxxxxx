This is not the official soundtrack. There is no official soundtrack at 
this time. This is a game-quality dump of all audio tracks that sounded 
like music which were in the game's data file around the time of BWE2. I 
may have inadvertently included some ambient sound as well as music, 
however I believe I filtered out most of the ambient tracks. All files 
tested to play in VLC, I preserved the original encoding so as to 
preserve quality, even so some of these tracks sound not so good, but 
until ArenaNet releases the soundtrack (and you buy it!), this is the 
best we have. Someone already did this and put it on Youtube, but it 
seems to have disappeared, and it wasn't complete anyway. There are no 
track names or anything else and the filenames are simply sorted by 
filesize, none of that information is available from the .dat file.
