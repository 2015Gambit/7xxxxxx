,drkcl3r,2012-06-24T10:13Z,"god damn, aussies..... if you're going to leech so hard bump your upload speed from 1k. MMA has to be one of the worst things for seed ratios.  Then of all countries australians seem to be the worse seeders of all. Even the ones who do seed eternally have such a low upload speed that it takes almost a week to achieve a 1:1 ratio with their download speeds being in excess of 30Mbit but uploads of less than 1Mbit. I say this as the seed/peer pool is filled with australian dns's/hosts (Peer dl 300k+  Peer ul 0.2k) lets keep this thing we call sharing at least some-what fair now guys. "
,spookydriftr,2012-06-24T10:45Z,upload speeds are on unlimited get off your high horse australia has slow internet speeds deal with it we have to
,MMA101,2012-06-24T11:02Z,Hear that? Stop making us decent aussies look bad and pump up your upload speeds. Shitty attitudes like yours is why it takes 5 hours to download 1.5GB
,bloodred125,2012-06-24T11:52Z,"lol whatever, there was a time when it would take 3days to download 1.5Gb's. Stop your complaining or go and buy the event."
,KarateBoi,2012-06-24T12:20Z,Before accusing us Aussies of not seeding ... check out the bandwidth allocations available to us. I am lucky to get 1Mbps d/l and even on unlimited my u/l maxes out at 10kbps. We aren't as fortunate with the improvements in technology.
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-06-24T13:18Z,Don't get the 25 fps thing. It ain't a movie.
,arsebandit100,2012-06-24T16:25Z,"Why the fuck is it that everytime I dl something of yours there are bits missing ffs.

Worst uploader that I've ever come across.

,P3BKAC,2012-06-24T21:46Z,This is a crappy DL.  don't waste your time. NOT WATCHABLE
,extracube,2012-06-25T06:12Z,"This is alright, I'm just thankful to watch it at all.  If you want crystal clear video then you need to be at 3 or 4gb+."
,xrayernst,2012-06-25T06:58Z,"you can be glad youre not south africa, our download and upload speeds are the worst.
thanks to telkom and the goverment."
,mammerjam,2012-06-25T07:48Z,your not missing much UFC is a bunch of meat pounding idiots that couldn't make it through college
,mammerjam,2012-06-25T07:58Z,come AT ME BRAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE
,pilot234,2012-06-25T09:48Z,"@ xrayernst - DUDE, I know exactly what you mean. We used CellC to connect to the net, is it still that bad over there?"
,sadjeppe,2012-06-25T16:14Z,I'm greatful for living in sweden and having the internet speed I have. 100/100mb/s  =)
,ArturVGT2,2012-06-25T18:07Z,Sir manda muito!!!!
,funseeker521,2012-06-27T03:09Z,Complaining that Aussies are poor uploaders means you're too dumb to understand that a lot of people use proxy servers in order to avoid prosecution. Good luck with that brain thing.
,wylde1989,2012-06-29T09:22Z,@drkcl3r hey i agree i will always seed to at least 1.1 even more most of the time its all the people the the second its finish they remove it everyone needs to realize the someone seeded for them to get it so be fair
,stopbitch,2012-06-29T22:20Z,Audio is out of sync 
,DeviousDan,2012-07-04T10:32Z,Audio is poor and glitchy. I have this issue with all UFC Sir.Paul torrents. Get the other version.
,kingda74,2012-07-05T09:07Z,"Audio: 2 
(Sounds like rats are wrestling in your speakers)
Video: 6
(Flickers so hard you might have a self-induced seizure)
Event: -3 (This is why people bootleg shit)

Worst UFC in a long time.  And uploader, you get a E for Effort but grades are A,B,C,D, & F and this copy gets a F.  And thats not for fantastic.  "
,khjimmy,2012-07-08T23:22Z,I can't see the password... is there anyone who can write it here ?!
,NTA-Pro,2012-07-10T18:09Z,No people bootleg shit because they can and it often doesn't come with any major consequences -_-
,Jammin Man,2012-08-11T12:02Z,In Australia our ISP's charge extra for uploads as well as downloads and they give us crappy upload speeds also.
,Tommy1.2,2012-08-15T16:31Z,"mammerjam, you're an idiot first off. second, a lot of fighters made it through college, majority of them are at the top for their state for wrestling from the school they graduated from. Forrest Griffin is a former cop, what do you think you need to do to become a cop, go to college and get a degree. thirdly go waste your time commenting on youtube, your dumb ass would fit in their better."
