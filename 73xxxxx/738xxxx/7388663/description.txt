Containment: The Zombie Puzzler is an action puzzle game like youΓÇÖve never seen before. The goal of Containment is to surround zombies with survivors of the same color. But watch out for the zombiesΓÇöthey'll fight back by infecting the survivors in the street. Through the game's pulse-pounding campaign and multiple survival modes, you'll use your wits, items you find you along the way, and even the town around you to contain the zombie outbreak.

Not a Match 3 In Containment, you donΓÇÖt match three of anythingΓÇöyou eliminate zombies by surrounding them with survivor tiles.
These Tiles are Alive Each tile is a fully animated character that interacts not just with its fellow survivors and zombies, but also with the environment.
Unique Storytelling There's no time for cutscenes or dialog boxes when the undead are trying to eat youΓÇöthe story of Franklin County and its survivors is told through in-world text as you make your escape through what's left of the city.
Real-Time/Turn-Based Containment combines the cerebral strategy of a puzzle game with all the real-time action you'd expect from a zombie attack.
