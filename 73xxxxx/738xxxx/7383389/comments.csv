,jboog3085,2012-06-26T04:45Z,Hello again. Any chance that you've come across any work by Anthony Shepherd and The Roar/Calvery Christian Center?
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-06-27T15:32Z,"jboog3085, you've stumped me again.  There's no Anthony Shepherd in my collection to share.  :(  Furthermore, it's hard to even find any meaningful information on the man.  Sorry about that.

But if you have other requests, please let them be known.  :)"
,jboog3085,2012-06-27T23:39Z,:( ok sorry making things difficult but thanks for the effort it is really appreciated :)
