Thinking Evolutionarily- Evolution Education Across the Life Sciences[Team Nanban]tmrg 

Steve Olson, Jay B. Labov | NAS Press | 2012 | ISBN: 0309256895 9780309256896 | 111 pages | PDF | 5 MB 

DESCRIPTION: 

This book covers the broader issues associated with learning about the nature, processes, and limits of science, since understanding evolutionary science requires a more general appreciation of how science works. 

This report explains the major themes that recurred throughout the convocation, including the structure and content of curricula, the processes of teaching and learning about evolution, the tensions that can arise in the classroom, and the target audiences for evolution education. 
This issue summarizes the goals, presentations, and discussions of the convocation. The goals were to articulate issues, showcase resources that are currently available or under development, and begin to develop a strategic plan for engaging all of the sectors represented at the convocation in future work to make evolution a central focus of all courses in the life sciences, and especially into introductory biology courses at the college and high school levels, though participants also discussed learning in earlier grades and life-long learning.
