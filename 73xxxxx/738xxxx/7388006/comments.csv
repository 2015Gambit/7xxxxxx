,madcags,2012-06-26T11:52Z,I'm having the same problem using utorrent
,MKACI,2012-06-26T12:19Z,Seems a bit dodgy to me

,huffax,2012-06-26T13:15Z,"Yeah, nothing is happening, despite of the reported seeds, no matter what program you're using. 
Gotta just wait for a better torrent I guess. "
,privatejoe,2012-06-26T14:30Z,There's no copy in the newsgroups either.  It'd be nice if whoever can get to try a repost.
,sup1990,2012-06-26T18:55Z,yea this one isn't working for me :( please someone post a good copy soon!
,drewg,2012-06-27T03:01Z,"Seeding again, (I thought there was more than just me).

I ripped it from Channel 7's online website, then I converted it from FLV to AVI, as said in description.

I'll get a seedbox to seed this as well."
,sup1990,2012-06-28T00:56Z,thanks again for seeding :)
