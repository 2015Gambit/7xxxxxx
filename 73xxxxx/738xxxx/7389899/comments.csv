,nitrojunkie007,2012-06-27T03:33Z,Don't know why CCEnhancer-3.4 doesn't work for this version..!! 
,TheAslan,2012-06-27T15:34Z,"@ nitrojunkie007

Looks like it works but CCEnhancer does not recognize that if CCleaner is installed in Program Files (x86) and not in Program Files, so when you're installing CCleaner change its installation path to Programs Files (without (x86))"
