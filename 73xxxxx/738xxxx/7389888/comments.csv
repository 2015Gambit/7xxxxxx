,ShadyOne1,2012-06-26T20:34Z,"You're FUCKING AWESOME. Thank you reloaded.
I got one question btw. I got From Ashes DLC and i'm unsure if it will still work. Will it?"
,kaliver,2012-06-26T20:35Z,thank you!
,Itchiga,2012-06-26T20:35Z,"Extended Cut? 
How you think that? "
,SweRaider,2012-06-26T20:36Z,"thanks :) even though the ending cut still left large amounts of plot holes, at least there was some closure and some good scenes.."
,Itchiga,2012-06-26T20:37Z,"Sorry S4A , just readed about it on Me3 Page , Nice work"
,poffik,2012-06-26T20:38Z,"it better be worth it, or they gonna get another shitstorm :D"
,lightsR,2012-06-26T20:39Z,OMFG YES!
,Xelestial,2012-06-26T21:06Z,"Please don't spoiler it at all people, give others a chance to download and check comments without coloring their opinion!

And thanks SO much uploader! Been searching and waiting the past 5 hours for this to be uploaded. I'm a little nervous but anything is better than what we got. Will definitely seed for the next few days and hope that others will too!"
,thechronic_13,2012-06-26T21:19Z,why is the size 1.79 gbs and not 1.9?????
,Assyel,2012-06-26T21:29Z,Patch 1.03 is included or we have to download and apply prior to this DLC?

,bloodred125,2012-06-26T21:45Z,i dont suppose this comes with 1.3 patch? or Dl it seperately?
,topk,2012-06-26T23:06Z,"I will say outloud what so many were and are thinking but for some reason don't dare say - this game is massively overhyped and actually SUCKS. It's not fun anymore, it's derivative, unoriginal, boring and much more"
,lightsR,2012-06-26T23:55Z,^ idiot.
,scruto,2012-06-27T00:08Z,"My reaction when i saw it released:
Stopped all downloads
Searched on thepiratebay for it
Put it on downloads
Will stop playing any other game until i finish this and won't sleep until that :D
Thanks RELOADED for it!
And Thanks to the uploader to :D"
,scruto,2012-06-27T00:28Z,"@topk If u think so , than you don't know anything about games, so if u don't like it, than don't comment and leave!"

,kofke91,2012-06-27T14:00Z,"game crashing when shepard back from citadel and try to use elevator to go on enginere room

....hope u can fix that... :("
,ZoolooCH,2012-06-27T15:39Z,Why did I just download 1.79GB of data to get 20 seconds more of cut scenes? WTF. 
,Vodkev,2012-06-27T16:10Z,"@scruto Haha, same here. Didnt sleep at all cos I wanted to see all the endings and then it was time to go to work !


But I feel like it was not really worth it. :/ (still better than the 1st though)"
,scruto,2012-06-27T17:44Z,"@vodkev I said my boss i'm sick, and he said alright, so i have a day off just for ME3 Ext. Cut xD
But i still dl it, low seeding don't know why, im downloading max 100kb/s :/
and @befizzled don't spoil the game omg!"
,SweRaider,2012-06-27T18:08Z,anyone else having russian text? or is that an earlier problem? I have the same problem with to ashes dlc but couldn't fix it.
,Davidzior,2012-06-27T22:13Z,"Same problem that ShockWave91 has. I've downloaded the extended cut, updated game to 1.03, copied all EC files to ME3 folder and nothing happend - there is not any signs of activated DLC. :/"
,Koinzeel,2012-06-27T23:09Z,End is awesome now ^_^
,thechronic_13,2012-06-28T00:08Z,it was good... i mean i though we would get a extra side-mission or something but at least we got a new ending and a ending were shep can live (which i wanted).
,Semblance,2012-06-28T16:48Z,"Very nice, worked perfectly, thanks a lot."
,alucardvt,2012-06-28T20:50Z,"I downloaded it and extracted to the game folder, but when I get into the game the message """"The following downloadable content is corrupt and cannot be used. Please re-download this downloadable content and try again"" appears... I played from the arrival at the citadel until the end and the DLC didn't work. What can I do? :|"
,alucardvt,2012-06-28T20:52Z,"Not working for me, message ""The following downloadable content is corrupt and cannot be used. Please re-download this downloadable content and try again"" coming up...

What can I do?"
,dksunny,2012-06-29T04:25Z,does it works with black box version ??
,dksunny,2012-06-30T06:22Z,do we have to play the whole game again ??
,teranomad,2012-06-30T22:11Z,"Does this have any new content or just different video's triggered at the end ??? 
In the latter case it's not worth downloading in my opinion ...."
,couteau,2012-07-04T15:31Z,"Lol, the EC is shit IMO.
- SPOILER WARNING -
The Starchild is a reaper. Bioware approved it by changing his voice when you reject his options.
So my question is - why should i trust a reaper?
If you reject his options, all you get is a slap in the face, because you rejected and you loose. So, i don't get it. IT would be mind blown ending. 
Bioware/EA fucked up pretty bad. Too many plotholes. "
,D_A7,2012-07-07T22:59Z,"Dont waste your time downloading , just go to youtube and watch all 4 endings ."
,Fantomnz,2012-07-10T10:37Z,"That would defeat the purpuse of being a avid junky of ME seriously ROFLMFAO :)
I waste more on stupid movies ""Grins"" Hahahaha"
,sixor,2012-07-13T15:22Z,"ok so i copy the files, then what? i have to play the end again? talking stuff to elusive men?"
,Fantomnz,2012-07-13T21:41Z,"Hmmm thats what Im also wondering???

1st can someone post exactly what they did to install the DLC & had it work for them???

2nd can it be done halfway threw the game & still work??? Can you install it then load a previously finished game save just near the end & it still work??

Any Info would be appreciated many thanks.

LOL I might end up post the answers myself :)"

,AznAssassin,2012-07-16T01:22Z,"srsly tho, this ending still sucked. Its basically just a bunch of crappy cutscenes. I am NOT wait 30 mins for the game to reinstall and replay the bullshit just to get around 9 mins of mediocre cutscenes that say nothing new about what happened to shepherd. Youtube it if u dont believe me. Its not worth the download and time. "

,CF90,2012-08-08T15:21Z,"Thanks for the upload, scene4all. Works without problems with the 1.03 update. And I'd like to let you know that the ""Firefight Pack"" DLC is out now."
,Fantomnz,2012-09-03T13:25Z,"Hi all Firefight works but you need to patch it with editors if you dont want to lose work you may have done already.

Latest update bit gutted with the leviathan dlc (dosnt deserve capitals!!!)

So finished another run through game play 35mins guess others are slow but had all the achivements sucessfull at the end so that was it then!!! Sad hoped for alot more.

Anyways the dlc installs fine and after palaven you can access it on your private console :)

If your good at this game its over to quickly but cant nock the quality movie animation quality all the way.

I do have another question any info or variables to get the TIM ""The Ilussive Man"" to shoot himself at the end?

Unless there is more which suspect there is as there are planets I cant access on the map Im now gona do the Leviathan part omce mre and move on :)

Maybe another dlc just to bug the fark out of me coming soon LOL
