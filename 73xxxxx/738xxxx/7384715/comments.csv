,wntrwlf,2012-06-25T05:10Z,LOL I commented on the wrong torrent.. even still.. you are the BEST! IMO.. TY!
,EpyxZ,2012-06-25T06:46Z,"Thankz eztv as always!!

I would like to remind you all to watch this episode and all the others via the TV channels web page when they come online. By not doing so you are only helping them cancel this TV series like they have to so many others because they see no views via there pages & or TV stations.."
,EpyxZ,2012-06-25T06:47Z,All you have do to is just load the Channels web page and video and let it play when your AFK or whatever. We need to keep these shows active even if we watch it before it hits the channels pages.
