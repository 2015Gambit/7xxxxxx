SUMMARY......: Original Air Date 06/25/2012, Documentary, Science, Performance
Nik and his elite team of professionals decide to go visit Atlantic City, N.J., for a hire wire walk and a rotating apparatus known as the Wheel of Death; a feat to be performed 28 stories above ground causes safety and logistic problems.

RELEASE NOTES: For some reason the title changed from "Danger by Design" to "Nik Wallenda's Beyond Niagra". That's a mouthful and sounds awful. Sticking with "Danger by Design" as that is the original title for the series.
