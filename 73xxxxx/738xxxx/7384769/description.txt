Note: straight forward reencode of T.R.M
release very nice work guys jus did a
likkle bit to this mainly worked on the
noise a likkle on the colours etc came
out pretty nice, this does still have
23mins of the old video with the flicker
but the majority of the film 1hour 34mins
is the new source from T.R.M soo no flicker
overall very nice indeed, HOPE you Enjoy 

Note2: the first 2mins is quite bad but settles
nd the cam has some focusing issues now and again
