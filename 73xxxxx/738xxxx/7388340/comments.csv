I'm glad I watched the race before reading the comments, that was just a great race too!

Vudu: you're obviously under 18 and have no life ambition other than to piss people off, but you'll never know what it's like to have genuine human emotion or to be excited about something. Enjoy your sad pathetic life kid... say something like that in public and you might have a short life too..."
,dioseolo,2012-06-26T17:44Z,"Thanks a lot!

P.S.: VuDu4000 you didn't spoil anything if that was intention. Everyone already watched the race either by downloading the BBC HD version or just the Sky avi version. You're still a faggot, though."
,rc90029,2012-06-27T07:36Z,"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKK YOUUUUUUUUUU VUDU you piece of shit scumbag mother fucker.  

 THANK YOU Footy, I finally got to watch the SKY sports intro and ending.  I hate watching that annoying fag jake humphrey. "
,Paronomasiaster,2012-06-27T11:46Z,Is it possible to get this vudu cuntbag's IP banned for that?
,vfeore,2012-06-27T23:44Z,"Amazing! You've impressed me once again. Thank you very much, Footy.

As for vudu, he/she can go sit on a rusty cock."
,Quasar99,2012-06-28T02:34Z,"Footy, you're forever the best!!! 

I don't get to see the race live very often (due to work)  but end up watching it on the spanish website when i get home..... but there's no bloody comparison!!! Spanish web broadcast (why hold back?!?!?.... the WHOLE antenna 3 broadcast!!.....) is SHEEE-EYET. 

I'm sure I speak for all expats (in mainland europe and abroad), your effort is a samaritan service for all of us who live abroad and don't get a piece of ""home"" often or even get the chance to watch the race if it's not shared . All the best karma to you, you make alot of us chuffed.

Poodoo4XXX, you're a waste of space. "
,zed1234,2012-07-02T01:13Z,footy you are SIMPLY THE BEST! Thanks a lot
