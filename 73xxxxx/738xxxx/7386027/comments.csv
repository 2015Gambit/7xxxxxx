Apparently a crack is not needed, it doesn't have protection. So yay.
It patches itself to 1.4 as well."

,faetoner,2012-07-20T04:34Z,"Does it work on Windows 7 x64? Because I've got version that lagged and it worked on windows mode with wrong resolution (button ""EXIT"" were under screen so I couldn't press it)

Thanks!"

I have windows 7, but it's 32, not 64.
It works fine with me, though I will agree it does get laggy in a certain spots, but it isn't noticeable.

It doesn't automatically go to windows mode, so it might be different than the last one you tried.)

(if it is in windows mode, hitting alt-enter might force it to fullscreen too.)

I'd say install it, try it out and remember to have your graphics cards and other software up to date too.

You might want to head to the game's main website and it's forums. If it has issues with the 64 and if any solutions have been found, you'd most likely find it there."
