The eponymous sophomore outing from melodious, heavily carbonated, Cincinnati-based dance-pop quartet Walk the Moon occupies the same neon-splashed, hyper-literate head space as high-energy bands like Phoenix, Passion Pit, and Foster the People. Led by frontman Nicholas Petricca, who can go from a nervous David Byrne wail to a glassy 90125-era Jon Anderson falsetto in a matter of seconds, the bandΓÇÖs slick blend of classic new wave, tech-savvy dance rock, and mathy indie pop can be jarring upon first listen, but multiple spins reveal an impressively tight unit that understands the thin line between immaculately rendered electro-art pop cacophony and hook-friendly modern rock.
