,harish7u,2012-06-26T14:02Z,Thanks a ton. Except for people like you we would never be listening to such gems. As a request could you please upload this album to Mediafire. It'll make the process of sharing easier and much more useful considering the limited no of seeders.
,hardik12,2012-06-26T21:12Z,"Advaita is the kind of band who deserves much more mainstream popularity then they are actually getting. As it's not available for download on song.pk, I'm afraid that this album might get overlooked by many. And that is the only reason why I have uploaded this torrent.

I request you guys to follow advaita on facebook. Stay in touch with their updates. And if possible, please buy their music. We can always motivate the band by going to their concerts, buying merchandise & music. 

@harish7u
You're welcome. BTW you are right. There are not many seeders but I will be seeding as much as I can. 

Currently one can download the album via this torrent. In future if one can't download because of 0 seeds then I will surely put the link of mediafire. "
,harish7u,2012-06-28T19:59Z,@hardik12 Thanks a ton. I would suggest you put it up on mediafire along with their first album Grounded In Space. if you have immediately and not wait till the torrent reaches 0 seeds. Links get shared easily on the net compared to torrents. Just a suggestion and request. Thanks anyways.
,hardik12,2012-06-30T03:53Z,I have finally uploaded both of their album to mediashare but I am unable to post the links here. It is giving me the database error. 
,harish7u,2012-06-30T20:22Z,@hardik12 You cannot directly post mediafire links in the comments. You have to post it in a slightly modified manner. 
,harish7u,2012-06-30T20:31Z,@hardik12 Just post part of the two links after the question mark in the mediafire links. Upload them in 320 Kbps CBR/VBR
,harish7u,2012-06-30T20:34Z,@hardik For example just try putting this string 44c4b8hjwxlb52f in standard mediafire link to  download Chris Brown's Fortune.
,hardik12,2012-07-02T22:08Z,"I have already uploaded both of these albums. 
Alright. Thanks for the help.

For their first studio album ""Grounded In Space"", include 5q4a6nqr8463d5z

For second studio album ""The Silent Sea"", include ohjqs0fc52yc3gy  "

,harish7u,2012-07-04T06:58Z,@hardik12 Thanks a ton for all your efforts. Hope more people get to know about Advaita and buy their music from your efforts. Thanks again.
