About the band:-

ΓÇÿAΓÇÖ- non, ΓÇÿdvaitaΓÇÖ ΓÇô dual, Advaita means experiencing all as ΓÇ£OneΓÇ¥. To the uninitiated, Advaita is an eclectic fusion band based in New Delhi, India. It is the expression of eight distinct musical sensibilities that dissolve into each other to bring forth a truly unique and ingenious sound.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In their interview with NH7 last year, the Delhi boys (Advaita) mentioned how this lineup has been the one that has worked on all the songs together, and hadnΓÇÖt been consciously thinking about a particular sound or genre for the album 'The Silent Sea'. 

"WeΓÇÖve not been thinking so much about genre and such things. ItΓÇÖs more about the sound as a band. Over the last couple of years, weΓÇÖve got to know each other better as musicians and as people, which helps in the creation of the sound as the final product."
