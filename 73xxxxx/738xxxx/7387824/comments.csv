,madtagger,2012-06-27T18:03Z,"Thanks so much for the torrent. I love the releases!

but I am noticing that IMMERSE has been compressing its releases sooo much.
Please guys, don't dim it down to 800mb, push it up to at least 1.2 gb cause I've noticed
that in fight scenes or fast scenes everything gets sooo blurry and pixelated.

At least 1.2gb for releases would be nice. 

Thanks!"
