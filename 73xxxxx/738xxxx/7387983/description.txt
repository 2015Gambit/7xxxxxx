From Wikipedia:



The Stampeders are a Canadian rock trio, consisting of Rich Dodson, Ronnie King, and Kim Berly.


The band formed in Calgary, Alberta in 1964 as The Rebounds. The Rebounds had five members: Rich Dodson, Len Roemer, Brendan Lyttle, Kim Berly, and Race Holiday. They renamed themselves The Stampeders in 1965 and Len Roemer was replaced with Ronnie King and Van Louis. In 1966 they relocated to Toronto, Ontario, and became a trio in 1968 when Lyttle, Louis, and Holiday left. In 1971 they had a hit with "Sweet City Woman," which won Best Single at the Juno Awards, reached #1 on the RPM magazine charts, and #8 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Written by Dodson, the track stayed in the Billboard chart for 16 weeks and the disc sold a million by September 1971, and the R.I.A.A. granted gold disc status. They also won Juno Awards for Best Group, Best Producer (Mel Shaw), and Best Composer (Dodson) that year.

In 1976 they had another U.S. hit with "Hit The Road Jack", featuring Wolfman Jack. In Canada they went on to score twelve Top 5 hits.

The band broke up in 1977, but reunited at the Calgary Stampede in 1992. They released a new album in 1998 titled "Sure Beats Working".

They continue to this day to tour Canada doing fairs, festivals, casinos and theatres
