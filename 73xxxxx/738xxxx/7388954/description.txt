An adult sci-fi novel from the bestselling author of the Twilight series.

In the future humans have become hosts, their minds taken over while 
their bodies remain intact. When Melanie, one of the few remaining "wild" 
humans is captured, she is certain it is her end. Wanderer, the invading 
"soul", was warned about the challenges of living inside a human. But 
there was something Wanderer didn't expect: Melanie refuses to give up 
her mind.
