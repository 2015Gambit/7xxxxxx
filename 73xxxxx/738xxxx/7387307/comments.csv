,jayro83,2012-07-09T01:05Z,Why does nobody trim these roms with nds rom trimmer? I trim every NDS rom I have to save SIGNIFICANT space on my R4i 3DS cart's 2GB SD card.
,nsdcx,2012-07-09T10:44Z,@jayro83 Because it's 2012 and we have microSD cards larger than 2 GBs now. 16 GB cards are less than $10 (American) on amazon.
,compmix,2012-07-10T00:02Z,I'm sharing a clean ROM so that people may have the option of trimming/patching/modifying their ROM from a base source.
