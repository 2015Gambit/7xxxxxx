,CapeCodSmith,2012-06-25T17:35Z,Didn't mean any disrespect....i just haven't gotten the 10.7.5 update....because its a developers update and i run the retail version of Lion....I also run the developers 10.8 Mountain Lion...I think the update is to help get ready for the release of Mountain Lion next month.
,Cachorro,2012-06-25T17:54Z,"Apple Seeds OS X 10.7.5 Build 11G15 to Developers
Tuesday June 19, 2012 12:07 pm PDT by Eric Slivka
Following yesterday's news that Apple was preparing to begin seeding versions of OS X 10.7.5 to developers, the first of those developer seeds has now been released. This first version arrives as Build 11G15 and asks testers to focus their efforts on the following areas:
- Graphics performance and quality 
- Image & Media importing, editing or viewing 
- Networking reliability & performance
The build weighs in at 937 MB for the delta version and 1.87 GB for the combo version that can be used to upgrade from any prior version of OS X Lion. 

There are no known issues associated with this build, but a timetable for a public release is unknown. Apple has announced that it will be launching OS X Mountain Lion sometime next month, and it is likely looking to release OS X 10.7.5 before that time, although the company has occasionally released maintenance updates for its operating systems even after their successors have launched."
,velislav25,2012-06-25T17:59Z,"Thanks to @Cachorro for providing additional info,and also i don't think that this is for mountain lion.It's maybe the final version of lion.Like it was with snow leo 10.6.8 :) .Maybe they'll focus on Mountain Lion and it's future updates.And once again,guys please seed in order to get the torrent as fast as possible.Thanks !"
,pryingeyes,2012-06-25T18:02Z,"Wow. Lots of misinformation above. CapeCat, if you're running the developer's release of ML then you should know what this is, and if you don't, you shouldn't be playing around with dev releases. This has nothing to do with ML. It is an early version of an update to Lion, pure and simple. It is expected that the final release of this may be the final Lion update ever, although there could be one more (which would be 10.7.6).  This update addresses several issues as detailed in the link below provided by 7117. It is not a final release, but it is fairly close. You will not receive notice of a 19.7.5 update in your Software Update process until the final release is out. Class dismissed. "

People ... the dude said he didn't mean any disrespect to anyone, so why come on here and act like fucking arrogant and pompous jackasses???  Keep your fucking bullshit posts to yourself and shove your smart-ass remarks up your collective asses.
