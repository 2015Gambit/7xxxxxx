Found on mac-torrents.com, thought I'd reupload here as I'd been searching for ages. Aside from having to use the fixes included, works perfectly for me. Below is the original description.

4. Fixed Sound Bug In GTA 3 And Vice City.
5. Fixed Ringy Audio Problem In GTA III
6. Fixed all three games so they do not ask you for updates.

Contents:
- GTA 3 Native K'ed
- GTA Vice City Native K'ed
- GTA San Andreas Native K'ed

They are ready to be played :)

NOTE: There is an ugly setting in the options menu from the game called "Framelimiter", this was turned on in the beginning and the game played awfully slow. Turning it off made the game perform excellent on all the highest settings.

If you used an older version please run the crack removal process located in Extra/OLD CRACK REMOVAL.

If GTA III or GTA Vice City give a resolution error, install the patches in the 640X480 folder.
