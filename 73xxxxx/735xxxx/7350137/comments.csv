,getting_there,2012-06-13T14:07Z,"Has anyone watched this and can they tell us whats included in it, I mean is there some extra halftime show stuff in this or what? The first half file alone seems to be 2 hours long and while I don't want to look at it (SPOILERS), the ""2nd half"" file is 44 min (@960x540).

The other chinese version or whatever it is clocks in at about 2 hours long."
,NTA-Pro,2012-06-14T00:48Z,Sweet. I was looking forward to a full 540p but I've already got this and I don't have any problem watching this as long as it's already download. Thanks :P
