Hi everyone!

This is Realms of Arkania III: Shadows over Riva.

This game is certanly translated to Spanish, but I believe you can choose to install it in English... not sure, though.

This torrent includes:

Riva.mdf
Riva.mds
Manual.pdf

The manual is in English, sorry.

Installation guide:

*You will need to install DosBox to run/install this game*

1. Mount/burn image into -for example- drive D:

2. Run DosBox and write the following:

mount c c:...   (where "..." is the desired install directory)

mount d d: -t cdrom   (remember, we mounted the image into D:)

d:

install      (now follow the intructions and install the game into C:)

c:

riva         (now, enjoy the game)


**Important note:

From now on, to play the game you will need to use DosBox. So, open the program and write the following:

mount c c:...   (where "..." is the directory containing the game)

mount d d: -t cdrom   (remember, we mounted the image into D:)

c:

riva



If there are any questions, please describe thoroughly what you've done and the error message, if it appears.

Have fun. ;-)
