The great Swiss-German actor Bruno Ganz gives a staggering performance as Adolf
Hitler in this full-scale realist German production detailing the last ten days
of the Third Reich. As the Red Army rampages through Berlin, Hitler and his
staff have retreated to the bunker under the Reich Chancellery. They are all
hereΓÇöHimmler, Goebbels, Speer, the entire fascinating, loathsome crew of
commanders, mad visionaries, and toadies (all brilliantly acted)ΓÇöand, leading
them still, a man so physically ill and constricted in movement that he looks
like a broken-down puppet from a Bavarian traveling circus. The puppet comes to
life, of course, in appalling self-pitying rants that are borderline funny. The
entire movie teeters on the edge of sick comedy-in particular such scenes as the
death of the Goebbels children, one by one, at the hands of their motherΓÇöand at
times one longs for a coldly malicious ironist like Brecht or Fassbinder to come
in and take over. The attempt to re-create Hitler in realistic terms has always
been morally and imaginatively questionableΓÇöa compromise with the unspeakable
that borders on complicity with it.
