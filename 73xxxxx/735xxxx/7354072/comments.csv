,gozinya,2012-06-14T20:50Z,Is this the same version uploaded by koedje?
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-06-14T23:39Z,This is not the section to be uploading cams in.
,pasetes,2012-06-15T00:25Z,"i guess the same Bulshit CAM converted into dvd Size.
Wait for the real THING"
,ddaviey3,2012-06-17T11:45Z,@ BaronVonWatermelon This is the correct category DVDR is for formats that are converted already and can be copied to a DVD without reformatting the files 
,Kottkastaren,2012-06-18T21:04Z,"@gozinya This is the Arabic one with NL subs hardcoded above the arabic ones, nothing new here. Would be better if the uploader knew how to write in English."
,cubstudios,2012-06-21T15:45Z,Just another cinema cam made to look like a DVD with annoying Danish subtitles. Wait for a proper DVD to come out. Same crap that this uploader always uploads.
,Kathelyn7,2012-06-26T20:48Z,"@cubstudios You're an idiot if you can't even read the ""NL subs"" part in the title and be surprised there's subtitles in it. It's like I'd look up Spanish subbed torrents and complain there's Spanish subs in them. Also, NL is not short for Danish. You retard."
,dmass71,2012-07-03T01:19Z,"I apppreciate the work you do, downloaded fine, i have have a question what is best software to change to ISO and/or what is best software to burn to dvd. thank you"
,pop_it,2012-07-15T16:21Z,Why are they allowed to do this shit. Is this section not for DVD quality monies. Maybe PB should look at creating a low quality DVD section for this crap.
,guccimaneflocka,2012-08-14T06:06Z,Hows the quality at least?????????????!!!
,Thejigsaw,2012-08-18T12:38Z,Why does all of your movies are always over 4gb^^
,schnitzelburger,2012-08-22T01:52Z,HD stands for Hitler Digital.
