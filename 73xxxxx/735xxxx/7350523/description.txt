Ripped directly from the CD to .wav using EAC, then converted to .flac using the FLAC frontend (compression level 8). Includes fully (and correctly) tagged files, EAC log, .m3u playlist, CUE sheet (for burning to a CD), and large cover art. Don't forget to decode the files with the FLAC frontend and put the CUE sheet into the CD writer! 
Enjoy!
