Snapshot Time! 

1. You can now use "/publish" to open your single-player game for LAN friends to 

join. This is still very much work in progress, so it lacks some necessary settings 

such as what game mode your friends will get, and if they should be able to use 

cheats or not. Also, the "/publish" command is temporary, you can't even access it if 

you haven't enabled cheats =)



2. The Ender Chest has been changed to have an inventory per player and not per 

world. Also, knocking down the chest will break it into 8 obsidian, unless you have 

Silk Touch.



3. The texture pack folder button now works on Mac

4. A lot of smaller changes and fixes
