,izoniazyd,2012-06-26T08:44Z,"Checked with MSE and AVAST with no problems. wa.exe is acracked so it raises alerts, just ignore them. Or if you are concerned upload it to virustotal and check results :)"

has anyone found a sollution??"
,naderskf,2012-09-08T13:03Z,"I'm using Windows 7
I've found a solution for the save problem.
1) Go to the directory folder of worms.
2) Right click on the game .exe file then properties.
3) In compatibility tab Mark ""run the program as administrator"".
4) In security tab, in group or usernames click on system, administrators and users and make sure the permission is set on full control.

Thats it. Hope it help (Worked for me!)"
