,zackqx301,2012-06-21T16:00Z,"I've bumped into a glitch in the game, while playing the level of croft's mansion (the real level of it not the tutorial) after the cutscene where Lara first encounter her evil clone and Alastair got shot, the game loads back to the same checkpoint before the cutscene. I can't seem to be able to complete the level, its just stuck in a loop."

,briangohan,2012-06-24T17:26Z,"Jay you have to replace the files with the cracked data, simply unrar the file and copy paste it into the contents.. what is named the same will get replaced... i still havent finished downloading yet.."

,rosstitute,2012-07-04T00:15Z,"There is a save bug unfortunately. If you do a manual save, it seems to throw the autosave function, and when you die it crashes the game. If anyone knows a way around this please post."
,Raiden3,2012-07-06T12:28Z,"How to go on ""contents"" to replace files? :S"
,joaolonas,2012-07-07T01:45Z,"1- Use ur mouse right buttom on the tomb rider icon after the unzip,
2- u get to a folder called Mac OX left click that one.
3- contents
4- copy paste the unziped  crack into that folder replacing the two files inside.
5- Start the games and never go on youtube looking for walkthroughs..... 
6- I enjoy more being lost with Enzio."

,Bonky23,2012-08-02T01:16Z,"Honestly, a complete waste of time. Gameplay is shitty and boring. This may have been fun in 3rd grade when the only video games I had ever played were Mario and Treasure Mountain"
