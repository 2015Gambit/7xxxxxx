[H],HeroMaster,2012-06-13T19:28Z,ENJOY Krater New PC Game by SKIDROW!
,D0gmeat,2012-06-13T22:15Z,"Remember DX11 or DX10 is needed to play. So if you're running WinXP, you're SOL. If you got Vista, you need to update your DirectX if you can.

Thanks for this. Will have to wait to see if they release an XP version (not likely) or when I do my PC upgrade."
,garlor,2012-06-13T22:26Z,"installed, cracked, but when I load the krater.exe process loads does nothing and closes, shoudn't there be a exe in the crack?"
[T],dramacore,2012-06-13T22:42Z,"thanks, wanted to try this out.

kind of a shame it doesn't have multiplayer."
,Ard0n,2012-06-14T12:21Z,garlor: I dont have this version but krater.exe doesnt work you have to click run_game.exe :)
,paleMasterszz,2012-06-14T16:04Z,"works great ! fast download ! game is soo awesome :D 
i thought it will be bogin action like neverwinter but its really cool gameplay . Nicly done. I weit for developer to add multi and stuff and i will buy it. Its worth it  but for now check it out test it on your own !  "
,dayvancowboy85,2012-06-14T17:41Z,"Ok this shit definitely has a trojan on it. I ignored the warnings when I installed it because of what people said on here, now my AV program has to block a trojan every time I start my browser. You have been warned!!"
,OmniNegro,2012-06-14T18:44Z,"""IF"" you have a trojan, you got it elsewhere. HeroMaster does not spread malware."
,dayvancowboy85,2012-06-15T00:21Z,"Maybe HeroMaster doesn't realize it either. Anyway, download and install at your own risk. Both the Skidrow and Theta copies of this game had real trojans for me. KaOs version was safe."
,OmniNegro,2012-06-15T02:35Z,"Maybe dayvancowboy85 was hired to harass people on torrent sites and make them think there is a problem so they buy the game out of ignorant fear.

This torrent is exactly the same content as a half dozen other copies made by others. It is not infected.

Go away troll! We do not welcome your bullshit."
,VegitoDBZ,2012-06-15T19:22Z,this game is a piece of shit
,Gnob77,2012-06-15T19:32Z,Thx
,RiverRaidII,2012-06-15T21:56Z,"In 99,99% of the cases when there's a virus alert, it's one of your two dozen open tabs with pron. But years ago there were people who would download a dialer dot exe, if a page requested it. 

As for this torrent, it's of course virus free. Like stated."
,charlene17,2012-06-16T00:14Z,"It's so easy to mouth up with the false positive and so on !
But find out by yourself.... When ping.exe will be used by the installer and you'll find yourself connected to a 83.133.124.191 site and full of unknown  processes first in UDP then TCP.
Win32.ZAccta ess.k
win32.refef.TA.trojan

stay away from every skidrow release of this game (and by the way there's really nothing thrilling about it)"
,charlene17,2012-06-16T02:06Z,"2 hours of work to get rid of a nice rootkit infecting the TCP/IP stack, nice work guys for a shitty game !"
,debiddo,2012-06-16T07:58Z,"""... every time Krater is pirated, God kills a kitten."" It's ok, I don't believe in God anyway :3"
,2-K,2012-06-20T19:32Z,HeroMaster would you please upload the latest patch for this game
,kofma1,2012-06-23T16:46Z,my characters can not get past rank 5...?  what is this sh**t?
,kofma1,2012-06-23T16:47Z,my characters can not get past rank 5...?  what is this sh**t?
,ghhost123,2012-06-24T08:45Z,whole setup was saying retry ignore or abord.........DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT ..........REPT DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT

,_Menace_,2012-06-30T03:11Z,"and kofma, u need to buy new ""champs"" , greens go up to 10, purples go up to 15 with my current knowledge, maybe if u played the fuckiing game and tried to find out why, i wouldnt be correcting a stupid remark"
,_Menace_,2012-06-30T03:12Z,s
,_Menace_,2012-06-30T03:12Z,"kofma, play the game, chill the fuck out, and ull find out, dont make me correct ur stupid remark"
,viramundogs,2012-07-10T22:53Z,"any eta on update?.. ty so much
didn't play it yet.. changed res and it got blackscreen, saw it was fixed though"
,jed_gamer,2012-07-11T10:58Z,"Hey guys,
I've downloaded this game and followed your instructions, the game works (thanks) with no virus's (thanks again).
But I'm having an issue with the speed. My computer can easily handle this game... It handles other games like Warcraft III and half-life 2 and even skyrim.
This is a small download and the install file is only 2 gbs.
My computer is a 2.70gbz processor, with 4 gigs of ram, 500gb hd extra 1tb harddrive, 1gb graphics card...
Anyway I feel that should be more then enough to run this game in a better state then it's running... It's soo slow! 
So is there an updated patch??
Is there something I can do to improve the speed... Your probably going to say get more ram..."
,jed_gamer,2012-07-11T11:09Z,"Also when I start the game, I get a screen saying ERROR: patch notes unavailable. Then I click ok and play the game. Is that error normal??"
,squid39,2012-08-07T02:32Z,"Where is the game installation that i'm supposed to paste the Skidrow file in? (sorry, I'm kind of new)"
