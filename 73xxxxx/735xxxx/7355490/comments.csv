,uniquez,2012-06-17T11:09Z,"This one is Virus free...

Allow me to explain how to test Large files or Iso.

Greetings! I have been using TPB and thought I must start giving back to the community. 

Always use Virus Total for the very best in Virus Detection.https://www.virustotal.com Use Rar to create archives 30mb in size.

I use RAR to make small archives because https://www.virustotal.com has a 32mb Limit per upload.

Then I go to https://www.virustotal.com/ and upload each archive to be tested.

Very time consuming BUT YOUR 99 Percent sure your Virus FREE. Never Sure100 Percent!

Yes you are right man, this is a duplicate"
,torrentabuser_11233,2012-06-18T22:56Z,"This is a reply for SirePontiac:

No you do not need a cd/dvd to install you can put it on a bootable flash drive and do it that way if your computer down not have a dc drive, like if you have one of those shitty netbook computers. But if you have a cd drive I would go ahead and just use a cd to install, it is fast and takes a lot less time than a flash drive. BTW Will be seeding"

Thanx."
,xzink,2012-08-19T16:57Z,"Avoid. Both June and July versions buggy - tried both several times on different computers. The startup is buggy - there are times when the windows load screen hangs several times, making the startup very long. 3rd party programs (especially some specific HP drivers) often load a couple of minutes after the computer has started up. 

BE CAREFUL WITH THUMPERTM VERSIONS!"

,yogiwilly,2012-08-26T21:53Z,"I've tired this on imgburn and poweriso and it says im missing files, between 20-30 by 65%. This is what I've tried..

IMGBURN >> open >> write image file to disk >> picked out the .iso from my utorrent download >> then clicked BURN.  (( I've tried it at Max Speed, 3x speed, 48x and 8x)) out of the 5 times, 3 didn't work and 2 worked but said missing files during instillation. 

PowerISO: open the program >> open >> choose .iso file from torrent download >> BURN >> speed (ive done max and 48) those are the only two options I have -- and with everyone it has said missing files. multiple files.

I also tried downloading TWO other XPs and trying both, and they ALL say missing files. What am I doing wrong??? Someone please help me. "

,accujack,2012-09-08T21:13Z,"Upon install, I noticed that this ISO installs a version of the ""Generic backdoor"" trojan.  It did it for me under hidden files named ""mscdsc.exe"" and ""dll.exe"" along with some registry keys to auto-run it. 

Fresh install on clean, new hardware, and this was the only install, no other disks stuck in yet.  I'm guessing this ISO was meant to allow the uploader to take control of piles of home PCs to form a botnet.

Make sure you run a virus scan after install.  AVG trial edition caught and cleaned the problem for me."
