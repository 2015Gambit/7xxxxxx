If you listened to some playlists this month you will probably agree it was one of the worse months for indie music lovers. Only five or six tracks did ring some bells. However I was well prepared and managed to compile some of my best Indie playlists this year. So do not be disappointed in other lists and listen to these ones..... Enjoy
