The Legend about Great Existence of the Universe. Compiled by Dj Adept

'Space Of Power', an attempt to send the listener on a journey through outer space and feel the energy force of the global processes of the universe, as well as feel yourself in the role of the legends's hero of the Great Existence of the Universe.

At the beginning of the first composition there are words from the audiobook of Nicholas Roerich, 'The Seven Great Mysteries of Cosmos', which has long been for us an inexhaustible source of knowledge and inspiration. Recommended to all.
