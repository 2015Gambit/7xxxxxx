(This Intro is largely recapitulated in a README in the torrent itself, but
I have updated it a bit for the TPB posting)

This torrent, the "Hypnodomme Turbopack" is a follow-up to three of
my previous torrents (which were originally posted to the defunct
"empornium" tracker as mentioned in the internal README files and then to PB): 

 "Hypnodomme Superpack"
    http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4659014/fdhypno_Hypnodomme_Superpack

and

 "Hypnodomme Minipack"
    http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4573676/fdhypno_Hypnodomme_Minipack

and 

 "Hypnodomme Gigapack"
    http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4520487/fdhypno_Hypnodomme_Gigapack

If you enjoyed those torrents (which are apparently still seeded and active)
you will likely enjoy this one as well.

This torrent was originally posted to the defunct torrent tracker
"cheggit".  Almost immediately as it was posted, it got DMCAed, and
I lost my will to do any more torrents.  I finally figured I might
as well TPB it and call it quits.

There is a guy who calls himself "Door" or maybe "Doorchan" who has
repackaged the torrents I mention above with a lot of additional
files (including a lot of hypnovideo).  It's good work despite the
fact he doesn't like my Linux format README text files :-)

The magnet for his huge collection (if TPB doesn't strip magnets from
intro text) is:

This torrent does contain stuff his collection doesn't.

Anyway, I have tried to make sure there are no duplications across the four
torrents, but given that the various files get renamed all the time
(especially with mongo-descriptive names on Emule..), and the fact
that there are now so many files to check, I cannot guarantee that
there are no duplicates.  However I feel safe in saying there is
no massive duplication.  Be aware though, that trying to avoid duplication
leads at times to some inconvienience and odd situations.  For
instance, many hypnodommes have recordings which form a series and
are meant to be listened to in order.  If when I created the
"Hypnodomme Superpack", I had only found files 1, 5 & 7 of a series,
that's what went in.  If I later found files 2, 3 & 6, then those
went into the Minipack, and if I finally found file 4, then it would
go in this torrent.  If you want to assemble series from across all
my torrents and post them as complete entities -- go for it!

This torrent contains the the indicated number of files from
the following dommes (or hypnotists):

	37 mistress_joanne

	25 isabella_valentine

	37 mistress_candice

	29 mona_blu

I go through cycles of favorites, but currently my suggestion is that
you check out Mona Blu and some of her newer files like "Pulse Hypnotica"
and "Stripdown".

Enjoy!
