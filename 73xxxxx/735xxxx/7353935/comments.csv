sorry, I was going to include it, but decided not to make the torrent a smaller size.  Plus, I believe the unaired pilot had the same title as the aired pilot, leading me to think that they were going to be similar.  Therefore, I didn't include it.  You can always download just the pilot from: 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5804344/Sherlock.S01.720p.BluRay.x264-AVCHD

and then download the other episodes from me if you want."
