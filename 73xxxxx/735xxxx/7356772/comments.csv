,mohak12,2012-07-15T07:43Z,"Why instalation is in different lang . ?
it worked fine though   for those who cant do it install MS office then put Activator in the folder
Eg - C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Office
and open it and install KM service and click on all the White colored buttons and it is activated !
BTW Sharepoint ..... does not activate :(  please provide with key in comment :)"
