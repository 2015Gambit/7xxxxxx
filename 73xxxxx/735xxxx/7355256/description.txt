See what happens when futuristic technology collides with the cutting edge world of surfing and kitesurfing. Metropolis takes you on a journey from the design trenches of the Cabrinha lab to the far corners of the earth to showcase how technology has taken surfing's next level......to the next level. Join Andre Phillip, Stav Niarchos, Marc Ramseier, Elliot Leboe, and Gianni Aragno as they island-hop their way from their private slider park in Antigua to sessions in Rarotonga, Cabarete, Fuerteventura, and Maui.

Follow Pete Cabrinha out to Peahi (Jaws), Maui to surf the swell of the decade. Witness his record breaking ride on a 70 foot wave which landed him the prestigious Billabong XXL award and his entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest wave ever ridden. Metropolis is filmed and edited in the same creative vein that produced many accolades for Elliot Leboe's first production - Ten 4.
