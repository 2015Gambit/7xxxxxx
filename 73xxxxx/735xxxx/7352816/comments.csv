,asinencia,2012-06-16T02:36Z,"Thanks for uploading all of these! The stuff I've got from you is absolutely perfect, and it's a great summer filler - expand your minds, people! However, I'm stuck on 50.9%, with just one CD (thankfully the right one for me, number 3) complete. I could really do with some more seeders so I can complete my collection. Thanks!"
,macmaverickk,2012-06-16T21:59Z,Currently uploading @ 230KB/s... soon enough :)
,QBall70,2012-06-16T23:11Z,"Awesome uploads, macmaverickk!  Thank you for the outstanding efforts.

,jumjumb,2012-06-17T17:02Z,"@amjb:
Try this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7337333/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.5_%5BK_ed%5D_for_Mac

Works fine with Mac OS Lion. "
,Arizenheimer,2012-06-17T23:10Z,"Some of the content is locked if you don't have serials. Most importantly the milestone lessons at the end of each part. Any knowledge of a keygen or some sort of workaround for mac?? 

Thanks again for uploading this!!"
,Arizenheimer,2012-06-17T23:12Z,"^^Scratch that. Almost all of the content is locked. Definitely need a work around for this torrent to work, on my machine anyways. Any help is greatly appreciated."
,macmaverickk,2012-06-18T02:52Z,"When you double click on any language iso, don't go looking through it, its pointless. Just exit out of the window (but make sure it is still mounted/opened in finder).

Now fully disconnect from the internet (as a precautionary measure to prevent authorizations/registration with Rosetta Stone servers) , open the Rosetta Stone application (which you have successfully dragged to your applications folder and patched correctly). At the top-right, one of the drop down menus (the one next to the question mark) will give you the option to ""Add or Remove Languages"". Click that, and when it says ""Please insert the Language CD in the CD-ROM Drive"", Click Continue. From there, you can select the language you wish to install. If at any point it asks you for product keys, disconnect from the internet, and use this:

Activation code: 
xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx

Phone activation code:
1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111

Copy it exactly as you see it here. It may not work the first time. Just be patient. This does not always work for everyone unfortunately."
,mo.chakarova,2012-06-18T03:38Z,"Hey MacMaverickk,

I have snow leopard and I'm not sure if that is the problem to why I can't use the activation code you have provided. I've followed all your instructions. What can be done? 

Thank You for your help. "
,jondiablo,2012-06-18T06:05Z,"Ive been waiting forever for someone to put these up, works awesome macmaverickk you are a bad ass at teaching the world 4 free! haha"

,danieleleven,2012-06-23T03:49Z,"so i downloaded the ISOs for Spanish but i cant get them to work?

I am assuming i need  the actual app first, does anyone know a good link for the windows version?

Also how easy is it to load the language after the app is installed?"
,gangstaxo22,2012-06-24T01:33Z,"I'm new at this, I dont understand how to do this. can someone help????"
,Kavlaki9,2012-06-24T13:20Z,All your torrents are amazingly good!!! Thanks for them!!! You are an asset to this page! 
,danieleleven,2012-06-24T20:33Z,"i downloaded rosetta stone 3.3.5 and when i try to install the italian level 4 it says i need an update to rosetta stone? Any suggestions?

,nmc300,2012-07-06T02:54Z,Russian? Please comment no if it is never going to happen.
,nmc300,2012-07-06T04:21Z,Farsi would be better than Russian but nobody has that :(
,nmc300,2012-07-06T16:33Z,"Requires ""Activation Code"" to get all levels? Help!!!"
,navig8or,2012-07-12T21:15Z,"runs through first 2 units of lesson one then wont go ahead without an activation code/phone activation

tried the x's and 1's suggested a few times...no luck

any other suggestions?

Thanks for the upload btw"
,clrfld,2012-07-17T09:15Z,"From the Spanish language pack, a comment by amaggard, this worked for me too (hope it helps):

amaggard at 2012-06-24 03:50 CET:
GUYS. i created an account on piratebay for the sole purpose of telling you all why the crack isn't working for the activation codes. at least, why mine wasn't working. i was copying mdm.dat and pasting it into the resources folder of the package that was in the SAME folder as the readme document. there was no option to replace. what you actually have to do is open a new finder window, navigate to rosetta stone in applications, right click ""show package contents"" and then resources, and paste it there. this time it will replace another mdm.dat file. it worked for me after that, and the xxxx activation codes were valid. i don't know if this is the same reason that you all were having trouble, but i thought it was worth sharing. good luck!"
,navig8or,2012-07-22T23:44Z,"@ clrfld

Anychance you have the link for the mdm.dat file that amaggard mentioned?
"
,navig8or,2012-07-25T22:44Z,"Works like a charm :D

Thanks Macmavrickk, amaggard & clrfld!!

you are legends!"
,rhomancowboy,2012-07-30T09:06Z,Please seed!  Thx
,hbgrds33,2012-08-05T08:34Z,"Hey thank macmaverickk. I created this account to ask a question. So I didn't update anything, patched the mdm.dat file over correctly and installed italian and german. I have been trying to activate both languages for two days now. Whenever i put in the activation code (xxxx.... etc) it shows that there is a minor error. Any input or advice?"
,bengi90,2012-08-16T22:56Z,"@ clrfld

what is it im suposed to pasted into the resouses"
,bengi90,2012-08-16T23:03Z,ok i tryed the xxxx and 11111 but its not working what do i paste in the resources folder
,saguitar,2012-08-21T21:03Z,I'm trying to mount the iso files. Kinda new to this stuff. I didn't want to really torrent Daemon so I just got the demo. Every time I try to mount the files I get what I would get if I ran it with WinRar. Any tips?
,8t1773y,2012-09-08T01:56Z,"Love this torrent, Rosetta Stone is awesome! These are only language files, you need the actual program to run it."
,rugus,2012-09-08T23:56Z,Hey macmaverickk.... I have a licensed copy of rosetta stone French. Think this will interact badly? I have it on my PC and am about to transfer my stuff to Mac.  Don't want to make a big muck up of it.
