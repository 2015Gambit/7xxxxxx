User Review from IMDB
 It is the story of the life of an eccentric son of a rich man, and also the story for his hippie girlfriend. They didn't see each other for quite a while and in the mean time the girl has a daughter called puddle and they were living in the rain forest trying to save it and it inhabitants, until the day she moves back to her old town. She is engaged to a homeless hippie, and her daughter refuses to speak, because she wants to live a normal life. Then she meets with the young Mr. Wilde and she is disgusted by the fact that his father's company is destroying the jungle, she tried to save. But he tells her that his friend Fahad, who is also his competitor in everything, is a doctor, and that he can cure Puddle, so she could talk again. All of that of course was planned by the little girl. The storyline is funny, it is well written, well structured and has the funny outlook of arrested development. Gives me hope about TV!
