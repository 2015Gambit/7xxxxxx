You mentioned that season 3 started last May 2012.
But what about the all stars shows? That should be season 3. If not, what season was that?"
[T],duranie,2012-06-21T03:30Z,"According to TLC's website,  All Stars was it's own show. That was season 1 of 'Extreme Couponing All Stars' that aired.

My numbering of this show is based on TLC's official site.. not my own preferences.  They are clearly labelling the current season of Extreme Couponing as season 3, not season 4.   If they change it on the official site, then I will change it here.  :)

And thanks again for the upload!"
,jsnow78,2012-06-26T00:35Z,Really hoping MW makes the other ones available ASAP. I believe they are up to episode 7 or 8 now... and I can't find them anywhere! 
[T],duranie,2012-06-28T04:21Z,MW has just released more.  I will get them on here soon.  :)
