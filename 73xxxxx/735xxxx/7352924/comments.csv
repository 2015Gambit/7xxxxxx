,wiredcitroen,2012-06-28T03:54Z,EXCELLENT !!!!!!!!!!! and working too
,ekesky,2012-07-02T22:16Z,this better be good
,Secerbegovic,2012-07-05T11:32Z,like usual... serial doesn't work :(
,FrostC1,2012-07-10T04:24Z,Does this really work?
,FrostC1,2012-07-10T04:37Z,Ok at first I was unsure about trying this because of how new it is. All I can say is that I installed it and everything installed smoothly. The crack serial information did work for those of you wondering. I can't wait to get started!
,MacTavish_000,2012-07-13T04:36Z,"It works only for 14 days! When you input the serial it comes ""Thanks for registering"", and you THINK that its working. But, after 14 days, you get the message ""Trial period over"". And when you try to input the serial code, again, you get the message ""thanks for registering"" but mixcraft is NOT registered and you still have the message ""Trial period over"".

In fact, this is the same problem in almost every cracked version of mixcraft by all uploaders. It was the same in mixcraft 4, 5, and now in 6. I've tried downloading all the different releases. I find it hard to believe that they can't crack this software properly when they can crack every major PC game within a few days of its release.

,FrostC1,2012-07-27T08:07Z,Does anyone know where we can get a new crack or a Keygen?
,KeyRicks,2012-08-02T23:37Z,where are the comment
,FrostC1,2012-08-07T23:24Z,Guys try running mixcraft as administrator and then use the provided serial.
,Enzo03,2012-08-10T19:05Z,;_; still doesn't work..
,pokerface95,2012-08-12T02:28Z,"Worked perfectly.

Run it as admin before typing in the serial.

Mixcrafts been helping me make music for over a year now; i'm gonna buy this soon with my first pay cheque.

Thanks psydeep!"
,Boogie337,2012-08-13T03:07Z,it didnt give me a serial #
,theresdividnglines,2012-08-17T02:08Z,"Okay- For those unable to register I have found a solution... I was also unable to register/close the program/and have it remember I registered. So here's what I did to make it work...

-Uninstall Acoustica 6 if you have it installed.

-Remove Acoustica 6 folder from program folder if it's still there.

-went to registry (run- ""regedit"") and search for ""Acoustica"" and basically deleted all things acoustica.

-I have the acoustic6.exe blocked in windows firewall outbound rules, but I had it blocked when it wouldn't work so it's better to block it and be safe.

-Install the acoustic 6 from this torrent with internet OFF

-DO NOT copy all of the old VST folders/files into the new acoustica 6 folder after it installs. Every time I did this I would get the registration error... I'm not sure which vst plugin was doing this but one of them was...

Hope this helps..."
