[T],jmanwf,2012-06-14T12:43Z,Sorry to say folks this will be my last upload for days of our lives just getting to hard with work etc
,Dimmis80,2012-06-14T14:25Z,@jmanwf mate i understand all about hard work and stuff.Are u gonna stop uploading everything or just days.Because i think DOOL is very popular and it deserves to be uploaded and its the best soap all araund.But if u totaly deside this i wish u the very best and thanks for all of efforts..Now we need a new uploader like @disnafb.!??
,SoWErA3,2012-06-14T15:59Z,"I understand you are having a hard time with work and stuff but this sucks if there ain't gonna be anyone else that takes over :(

I remember ClaudiaZ used to upload DOOL and DBaum23 also did it a while and even in higher quality :) DvdVeeken also did it a while but unfortunatly I know of no way to contact them :("
,Dimmis80,2012-06-14T19:01Z,Yeah i my self remember @ClaudiaZ and ofcorse @DVDVeeken and they uploaded Days for a long long time.To be honest @jmanwf exept your uploads of the episodes i will miss the visual quality of your episodes..It was awesome..So again my friend i understand that u don't have the time but is there a way u reconsider and continue upload days.!?And if u realy can't again i hope @disnafb or someone else continues to upload it cause Days is the best Soap that there is and again deserves an upload for the poor or unlucky of us that we can't watch it..!:-(
,disnfab,2012-06-14T20:15Z,Thanks for all your DooL uploads jmanwf! Now it seems I have to continue uploading more DooL episodes. It may not be at the quality standard that some people would like but it's better than nothing.  ;)
,Dimmis80,2012-06-14T20:43Z,Yeah my man @disnfab.Ofcorse is better than nothing.Please take point now do your thing and continue from the place @jmanwf left us.We will be very happy..;-)
[T],jmanwf,2012-06-15T08:16Z,i may continue to upload but at lower resolution it will be th same as claudiez who you to upload 175 mb
,whiteangelone,2012-06-15T09:12Z,"Thank you for uploading Days.  Very much appreciated & I am not concerned about the quality for it's wonderful to view Days in full. You certainly are a kind, considerate person. I know you would have to pay for Days from iTunes, & you are willing to share with all of us....again, thank you."
,Dimmis80,2012-06-15T09:46Z,Ok my friend @jmanwf u can do that.If u can't afford to upload 296MB upload at 175 and that is very fine to.Quality is fine but i prefer to have just the episodes than nothing at all.And ofcorse yeah u pay for your episodes of days and u share  and that is very big and noble from u..Cheers.
