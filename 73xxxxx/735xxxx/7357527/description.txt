The authoritative reference on wind energy, now fully revised and updated to include offshore wind power
A decade on from its first release, the Wind Energy Handbook, Second Edition, reflects the advances in technology underpinning the continued expansion of the global wind power sector. Harnessing their collective industrial and academic expertise, the authors provide a comprehensive introduction to wind turbine design and wind farm planning for onshore and offshore wind-powered electricity generation.

New coverage features:
- turbulence models updated to reflect the latest design standards, including an introduction to the Mann turbulence model
- extended treatment of horizontal axis wind turbines aerodynamics, now including a survey of wind turbine aerofoils, dynamic stall and computational fluid dynamics
- developments in turbine design codes
- techniques for extrapolating extreme loads from simulation results
- an introduction to the NREL cost model
- comparison of options for variable speed operation
- in-depth treatment of individual blade pitch control
- grid code requirements and the principles governing the connection of large wind farms to transmission networks
- four pages of full-colour pictures that illustrate blade manufacture, turbine construction and offshore support structure installation

Firmly established as an essential reference, Wind Energy Handbook, Second Edition will prove a real asset to engineers, turbine designers and wind energy consultants both in industry and research. Advanced engineering students and new entrants to the wind energy sector will also find it an invaluable resource.
