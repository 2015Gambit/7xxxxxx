Today, it downloaded quickly. Yesterday I was experiencing the same problems as others. 

Either way, thank you very much for this!"

I don't know why that is happening,things on my side are running fine at least that's what my client is showing.I downloaded this yesterday after ImSoJaded posted a comment and it downloaded in 3 mins.

There might be a hidden problem on my end even though everything looks okay.I'm going to look into it.

Thanks for your feedback :)"
