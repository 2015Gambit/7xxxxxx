This torrent includes all of The White Stripes' studio albums AS WELL AS two singles of "Red Death at 6:14" and "Hand Springs". There is also an album in here, which is my personal favorite, but which I created myself. The White Stripes released a concert DVD of their concert in the U.K. entitled "The White Stripes Under Blackpool Lights" in 2004. In this torrent there is an album by the same name, but it is not a video DVD rip, but the audio from the concert DVD. The White Stripes DID release a record titled "Under Blackpool Lights", but it was only a single of a track from the concert. This is the entire concert; all 27 tracks. I searched Google Images for an image from which to create a suitable album cover, and I think you will all be pleased. As always, I have included a folder with high resolution album art for each album. All tracks have been assigned the proper tags should you import to your iTunes library.
