Complete set of Doll House, season 1 & 2
 
The show follows an organization that employs mind-wiped humans known as Dolls who are implanted with false memories and skills for various missions and tasks. When they are not 'at work' they are living in a real life Dollhouse which gives the show the name. One of those mind-wiped humans, a young woman named Echo, is slowly starting to become aware of herself and what's going on - all the while somebody on the outside is trying to bring the Dollhouse down while getting closer to Echo - possibly not aware that she is one of the Dolls he is after.

User Review from IMDB:
 "I've been waiting for this show for a long time, and I've been thrilled so far!
 
Granted, the synopsis of the show that I had read didn't sound like something I would be greatly interested in, I thought I'd give it a chance. And, I'm VERY happy that I did. The pilot left me looking forward to Friday all week long. And when the second episode did arrive, I'm not sure I took more than 5 breaths all hour. I was too busy taking in every little bit I could. And when it was over, I watched it again. 

It does make me wonder why Fox would put it in a slot where it might get as many viewers as it could. But, I have no faith that if people just turn on their TV's they'll be hooked. I can't seem to turn it off. 

My only complaint? It's not on 5 nights a week!
