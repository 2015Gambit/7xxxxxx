,Sleppmegin,2012-06-20T14:27Z,"""Choose A 'UserName' & 'Serial'."" ?

I cant choose anything after clicking on the serial button.... There is just some static thumper text there..."
,Sleppmegin,2012-06-20T14:38Z,"Well just reporting that it works...

I just tried a random name and serial...All is good. Thx"
,TheAnt3177,2012-07-03T02:42Z,"I don't understand this. I've done everything correctly but every time I restart my computer and open mIRC, it says it's unregistered. Granted, the serial works every time but it's annoying to have to put it in again every time I restart."

,messah,2012-08-15T12:13Z,"Same problem here,works fine until i restart the computer then its gone."
,PurePluto,2012-08-15T23:34Z,"Everything worked out great for me. Haven't restarted yet, don't plan to but I really assume that the entry into the registry will prevent it from having to be authenticated again, could be wrong. Great torrent upload!"
