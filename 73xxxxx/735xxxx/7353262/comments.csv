[T],trialNerror,2012-06-14T14:10Z,"i wish you knew just how much you fuck up videos. seriously. 

going from 29.97 to 25 fps drops every 6th frame and when you take something originally 23.976 and re-release it 25fps you're adding duplicate frames.  did you know when you change the frame rate you're changing the duration?  you're making everything about 20 seconds shorter or longer than what it should be. 

if you download something and convert it the one thing you DO NOT CHANGE is the FPS! can't stress that enough.

while i'm here - are you still doing that shitty 1 pass encode that gives you a very lossy blocky image?  again that's something i can't stress enough: to maintain maximum picture quality do 2-pass XviD encoding. to maximize quality to the fullest use abr mp3, not cbr.

why are you doing 640x352?  that's not proper 16:9 and may leave narrow black bars on some displays.  do 640x360 -or- 624x352 for correct 16:9. do not mix and match the dimensions.

you seriously slaughter any vid you re-release. and mislabeling them HDTV, too, just because you see an hd logo in the picture. that part of the filename in scene represents the video source - which would be a HDTV set top box. your sources are NEVER HDTV. you download other peoples work, convert it to a hacked up pile of shit, then feed it to all your ""fans"". your poor fans, if they only knew how much better their videos could be. it'd be like dvd, not vhs... but you already said you're perfectly fine with vhs quality. sad, really, especially in this day and age of high-def video.

see why i got so annoyed when you'd give me complaint after complaint on about just about every x264 mp4?  i'm glad you hated them, but you have no room to talk when you have absolutely NO clue wtf you're doing when it comes to video conversion.

i will admit, though, i do get a kick out of seeing you waste all that bandwidth!"
