For All Fall Down (Nonesuch), her first studio album in six years, Shawn Colvin enlisted the help of friend and versatile musical "buddy", the acclaimed guitarist and producer Buddy Miller. The initial offering of the collaboration comes via the new project's title track, a simply-structured song that, over the course of about three and a half minutes, slowly builds from hand-clapping acoustics to a epic riffed folk/rocker thanks to the shimmering guitar lines from Miller and Bill Frisell, Brian Blade's dynamic drum work and a gospel-tinged sing-along chorus that quickly embeds itself deep into the grey matter.
