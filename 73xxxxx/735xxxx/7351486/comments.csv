[V],Nepotu,2012-06-13T20:30Z,Is bigger because of 60fps (more realistic). It's a kinda difference from the 30 fps
,mentallyours,2012-06-13T21:18Z,"The Oklahoma City Thunder shook off the jitters and rallied from 13 points down behind big nights from Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to beat the Heat 105-94 and take a 1-0 lead in the NBA Finals. Miami had a big night from LeBron James (30 points) but it wasn't enough to overcome OKC's two All-Stars. Durant finished with 36 points (17 in the fourth quarter) and Westbrook added 27 (18 in the second half) to go along with 11 assists, eight rebounds and just two turnovers. Durant also grabbed eight rebounds and handed out four assists. Serge Ibaka was the only other Thunder player in double figures with 10 points.

The Heat had four other players in double figures, including Dwyane Wade with 19 points on 7-for-19 shooting and eight assists. Shane Battier added 17 points (one off a season-high) on 6-for-9 shooting, but he managed just four in the second half. Mario Chalmers had a similar game, scoring 10 points in the first half but just two in the second. Chris Bosh added 10 and played almost 34 minutes"
