Had you googled ""strahler physical geography torrent"" you would have seen this, right? Or, more closely, had you searched TPB's index, you would have found this:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7351751/ . Is there any use to your indexing a duplicate?

The sure way to kill a low volume torrent like this one is to duplicate it. In the long run, both the duplicated and the duplicate turn dead, for splitting a small number of seeders who become confused over which one is the good one."
