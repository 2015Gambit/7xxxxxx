The future of audio

Melodyne editor will change the way you work with audio. The note-based approach and intuitive operation of Melodyne editor will soon seem so natural to you and so much a matter of course that you will no longer regard audio as something fixed and given but quite simply as music. As music you can shape and refashion virtually at will. To correct and optimize or fully restructure in order to make new ideas reality. This is how we picture the future of audio editing. And with Melodyne editor, this future is yours already today.
