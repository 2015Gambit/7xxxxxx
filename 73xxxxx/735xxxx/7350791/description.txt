Radio Kalahari Orkes ΓÇô Grootste Treffers (2011)

Radio Kalahari Orkes has established themselves as favourites in the S.A musical landscape through a series of hits (ΓÇ£Kaptein KapteinΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Staan My ByΓÇ¥) and top selling albums (ΓÇ£OpgestookΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£HeuninglandΓÇ¥). The band is currently very active on the performance circuit and with enigmatic actor and TV personality Ian Roberts as lead singer and world renowned writer Rian Malan as co-composer and lyricist, the public demand for the band is still on the rise. Resulting from high profile public demand for their back catalogue of songs, this ΓÇ£greatest hitsΓÇ¥ album will be a sure winner. The album contains most of the songs used in the sound track of the film "Die Geheim van Slangfontein" starring the RKO band.
