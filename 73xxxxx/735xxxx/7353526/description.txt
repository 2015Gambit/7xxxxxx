As The Pirate Bay has now been unfortunately censored in the United Kingdom I have been in communication with the legendary Mac.Moe and have his blessing to take over the vitally important duty of providing Eastenders fans (I am one of them) with their daily dosage.

I apologise for the delay on this upload and I assure you there will not be delays in the future, I will aim to have the files uploaded only minutes after I receive them from Mac Moe himself.

Thanks for your patience

Also I will add that I will only seed each episode for 1 week because I don┬┤t have endless space on my computer so it┬┤s up to you guys to download and seed!
