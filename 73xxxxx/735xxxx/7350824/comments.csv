Basic advice, don't stream this movie to a PS3 or other BluRay device, do not burn this movie and play on a PS3 or BluRay device."
,peeyoosh1,2012-06-15T07:17Z,"pls tell --for every movie if it has-- ""FULL DRAMATIC RUSSIAN AUDIO or JUST READING OF ALL THE DIALOGUES BY A MAN"" 
Pls write about it in your upload title or the description of the Torrent.

I enjoyed the CARS 2 movie in Russian as it had full dramatic Russian audio.

Thank U anyway for Russian audio.
