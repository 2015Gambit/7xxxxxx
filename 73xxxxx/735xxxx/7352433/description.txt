At its heart are Powell's "Thirteen Rules"ΓÇönotes he gathered over the years and that now form the basis of his leadership presentations given throughout the world. Powell's short but sweet rulesΓÇöamong them, "Get mad, then get over it" and "Share credit"ΓÇöare illustrated by revealing personal stories that introduce and expand upon his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others. In work and in life, Powell writes, "it's about how we touch and are touched by the people we meet. It's all about the people."


A natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables with wise advice on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. "Trust your people," he counsels as he delegates presidential briefing responsibilities to two junior State Department desk officers. "Do your bestΓÇösomeone is watching," he advises those just starting out, recalling his own teenage summer job mopping floors in a soda-bottling factory.


Powell combines the insights he has gained serving in the top ranks of the military and in four presidential administrations with the lessons he's learned from his immigrant-family upbringing in the Bronx, his training in the ROTC, and his growth as an Army officer. The result is a powerful portrait of a leader who is reflective, self-effacing, and grateful for the contributions of everyone he works with.

Colin Powell's It Worked for Me is bound to inspire, move, and surprise readers. Thoughtful and revealing, it is a brilliant and original blueprint for leadership.
