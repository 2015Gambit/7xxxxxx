,jroose360,2012-06-18T02:51Z,"Maybe it was just a bad burn, but my disc that I burned is unreadable. Can anyone confirm to me that they burned a copy of this torrent and it worked?"
,brioneslaton3,2012-06-18T06:14Z,I just made the game and it worked for me so in my opinion its better to be on lt+ 3.0 so you won't have much trouble burning them
,faanvet,2012-06-18T15:13Z,"SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED !

You greedy twats!!!
Anyone actually knows what 2P2 is all about ???"
,dolphane,2012-06-19T07:21Z,"@faanvet and others similar:

u say greedy, but you might want to look at what you're doing and think for a second. the most popular game would not have a speed problem, no matter what, and 90 percent download at a respectable rate.....

I agree that everyone should do 1:1 ration (seed as much as you leech, can't ask for more realistically), but with something like this hopefully you'll begin to understand that your slow speed is due to something else (your internet perhaps?)....

bottom line: no way does a torrent with this much activity have speed issues.

btw, thanks boobman, u r the fucking man, wish people would ask if you even take requests before saying 'hey is there any way you can get this obscure movie for JUST ME???'
LOL"
