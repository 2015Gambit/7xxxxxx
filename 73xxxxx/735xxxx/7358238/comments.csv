It works really well :)"
,rttzz,2012-06-19T15:55Z,Very interesting. I uploaded this update  times before you did and both times some retarded admin deleted my account for it. Not just the torrent but my account. Including all the previous torrents. Well suck my dick. And suck it hard.

WARNING-when I used this my save data was deleted so backup beforehand. I was only about 30 minutes in though so it wasn't a big deal."
,nik_d,2012-08-27T19:22Z,"Do i have to install the previous updates or will just this do the job? 

I mean does this include fixes done in the previous updates. 

Plus this working with the skidrow version?"
