Yes, .tcl extensions represent a script-language called ""TCL"" which is made for unix/linux platforms. However, do some research and I think you will find TCL software that supports windows. Be aware though, if a program is made for unix/linux, there are rather big possibilities that it won't work on windows, even though you might have installed the language. Same goes with .py (pyton) and .pl (perl).  "
