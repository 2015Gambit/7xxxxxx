Phiew, preparing this pack took me some time, I tell you :D

Source, more info, complete pictures galleries for previews, cf :

Mogudan is a fucking GOOD hentai artist, with tons of volumes published in various formats, and he's been at it for many years.
This artist definitely deserves to become even more popular.

- I gathered ALL the English translated Mogudan works there were, the ones I was sharing, the ones I wasn't sharing yet. I also eliminated the several fucken duplicates with bloody different names just in order to waste MY time (it's a plot ! I know it !). I believe no English volume is missing.
- I sorted it all, gave proper folder names, removed obsolete or bested versions (no need for duplicates !).
- I added a few Japanese items when there was a reason to do so. I don't intend to offer you all the Japanese works, I only added specific Japanese ones. I only put inside it the Japanese works that I already knew and loved (with wild hopes to see them translated, some day, haha). 
Two ""Japanese"" works deserve more explanations : Akarihous (I'm only sharing the Spanish version, so I added the Japanese version in case the Spanish version wasn't a real translation but actually a rewrite) and Hira Hira (my English version was incomplete and only covered the SailorMoon part, so I added the complete Japanese version so that you may see the rest.)
- And that became the pack I'm sharing here :)

I hope you'll love it :)
My point is to allow you guys and girls to have a good Mogudan stack, without confusion or missing pieces, the goodness without the worries :)

Side notes :

- N2 Bomb, is drawn with Mogudan's brother, Izurumi (yeah, they're Nakayohi Mogudan and Nakayohi Izurumi). Funnily there are, in the beginning, pages drawn by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the mangaka behind the drawings of the ""real"" Evangelion, haha.
- Brave Soul, the set of CG pictures from the Brave Soul game, is in its Uncensored version
- Evangelimoon is in both versions, the low-res English one that everyone knows, and a splendid high-res Japanese version ! If you're an editor, you'd be awesome to reedit the Japanese version with the English dialogues, and then to spread the love :)
