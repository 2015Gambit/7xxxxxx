Plot: The last time Peter (Tom Everett Scott), poured his heart out as a screenwriter, his work was a smash hit, commercially and critically. However, it took more out of him than he was prepared to give. He turned his back on the movie industry and decided to pursue a ‘less emotionally taxing’ career. In an effort to escape from his inner demons, Peter purchased a storage facility in the heart of Los Angeles. All is going according to plan until Charlie (Sarah Jones), a down-on-her-luck actress, walks into his storage facility and changes everything.
