,aarque,2012-06-16T22:14Z,"If Space Shuttle X was released in 2007, it has likely been uploaded at TPB several times in the past 5 years.
In fact, it has already been uploaded 3 times before you, but hell, why bother checking or crediting any of the original seeders, even though it took me all of 15 seconds to search ""FSX shuttle.""

""It's not mine, I don't have to pay for it or worry about maintaining it, this Pirate Bay,"" huh Juazynhu. You wouldn't happen to be a personnel manager at Foxconn, by chance, would you?"

hey man stop to put old stuff here...
Here is a place of new files!

,virtualanarchy,2012-06-16T23:47Z,"Quit bitching. If you don't want to download it, then don't."
,aarque,2012-06-17T04:07Z,"Quit reading. If you don't have anything useful to offer, get your free software, type ""thanks"" and get the fuk out of here. Leave the details of how to keep this place running smoothly to the people that actually care about it.
Clearly virtualanarchy has not been a pirate long enough to remember any of the many tracker, server and search engine crashes."
,virtualanarchy,2012-06-17T05:50Z,"We all have to start somewhere you faggot, how is coming on here and blasting the guy for uploading this, instead of being like hey, this has been uploaded already, how is yours different to this uploads?

You'd think a 'veteran' like yourself wouldn't act like a 12 year old kid..."
,Juauzynhu_FSX,2012-06-17T18:54Z,"we will not discuss.
  I will not let this torrent die, so I upload it! If you already have, go away and do not download, but if there are people who think that my torrent is faster, let them enjoy.

bye and a kiss for all the friends Tpb.

Sorry bad english"

There's a MOD disciplining someone for the exact same thing. Go ahead and backtalk him, see where it gets you. At least I explain why it matters."
,Juauzynhu_FSX,2012-06-18T19:23Z,"how to delete it, the parasite that likes slow downloads?"
,aarque,2012-06-19T08:51Z,"If you actually want to delete a torrent, you must go here, register on the forums and make a post: 
https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=99094
To be fair, it is forbidden to duplicate your own torrents and it is discouraged and frowned upon to duplicate the torrents of others; for what should be obvious reasons. My advice would be to leave this active and adjust future activity, but do as you please. If you ask, it WILL be deleted...and in terms of speed, the download is controlled by the size, number and speed of those in the seed swarm. After the initial seeding, it is absurd to compare torrents in terms of speed, they can only be compared by seed/leech values."
