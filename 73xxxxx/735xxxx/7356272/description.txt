Five years ago our heroes the Duckrockers thought they had figured it all out ΓÇô they had found themselves girlfriends to take to Siones wedding and the future was looking bright: Michael had come to accept that commitment wasnt for him and he was always going to fancy white girls; Albert had finally hooked up with his co-worker Tania; Stanley, always the weird one, had managed to find himself a nice girl one of the catering staff from the wedding; and Sefa had even got the courage to propose to his long term girlfriend, Leilani. And Bolo? Well, apparently his name is actually Paul.
