In India gangsters are called Bhai (brothers).  
One such Bhai is Munna, who is feared by        
everyone in Mumbai, a big city in India.        
He cons his village-based parents into believing
that he is a doctor. He gets a shock when he    
finds out that they are coming to verify for    
themselves. So he transforms a rooming shanty   
house into a makeshift hospital, populated by   
patients, people he beats up. His parents       
arrive, are pleased, and happy that their son   
is well settled. They would like him to get     
married to a doctor's daughter. The marriage    
is arranged, but before the engagement,         
the bride's father finds out the truth          
about Munna, and cancels the marriage. Munna's  
humiliated parents see the truth for themselves,
and hurt, they return home, leaving Munna       
with a strong desire to hurt the doctor
