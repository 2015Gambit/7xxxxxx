,Limerain,2012-08-29T02:55Z,"@RetroEZ All you have to do to edit the title is to:
1: Right click on it in iTunes
2: Click ""Show in Windows Explorer""
3: Right click the file
4: Click ""Properties""
5: Under ""Attributes"" at the bottom, make sure ""Read-only"" is left unchecked
6: Click ""Apply""
7: Click ""Okay""
8: You can now edit it in iTunes whenever you want! :D"
