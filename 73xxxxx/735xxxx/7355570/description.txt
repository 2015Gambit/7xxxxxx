Micro Safari
Through the magic of television, zoologist Nigel Marvin and his crew get shrunk down to a 1/4 inch to explore an alien world of mammoth insects, in hit National Geographic show Micro Safari. An average domestic garden becomes a perilous terrain, fraught with wasp attacks, skulking spiders, and bad-tempered millipedes. Will Nigel and the team make it back to their car to be re-enlarged in time? Or will they become lunch for a ravenous garden shrew? This fun documentary provides an adventure that will educate and entertain, making it perfect for the whole family. There are an estimated 8000 species in the average garden, so there's plenty to see.


4)  Big Cats 
Nigel Marven, a genial presenter who comes across like a hybrid of Steve Irwin and Russ Abbott, is very much an 'up close and personal' man and in this programme he's getting close to the big cats. He tracks them down in Africa, India and Siberia, keeping us posted all the time about how he's feeling - 'My heart's hammering,' 'I am never going to forget this,' 'It's been like a dream' We've all seen big cats on nature programmes before, but I wanted to see them in the flesh to reveal new insights into their behaviour. The world's top five big cats are the ones that can roar; leopard, snow leopard, jaguar, lion and tiger. I met them all, jumping into the midst of a pack of lions to show that truly wild lions fear man. It was a scary moment, but I knew they'd scatter when they saw me, and fortunately I was right! I also tracked tigers from elephant back in India, but the high point came over the sub-zero snows of Siberia. We managed to sight a 10-foot Siberian tiger padding
