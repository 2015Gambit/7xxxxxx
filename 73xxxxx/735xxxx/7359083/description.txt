This is a collection of all of the wiki data from TV Tropes (tvtropes.org), taken in June 2012.  Since they decided to institute a censorship regime, this torrent exists to back up as much as possible of the pages of the site.  Also includes some pages they deleted, like the ever-popular NaughtyTentacles page.
