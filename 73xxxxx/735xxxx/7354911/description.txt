Brought up by a gangster named Bharat Malik,  
Shivam Pandit lives a faithless and reckless  
lifestyle, doing the bidding of his mentor    
- which also includes being a hit-man.        
Bharat does not get along with his brother,   
Raj, and nephew, Munna, who also resent the   
fact that Bharat trusts Shivam more than he   
even trusts his son, Ronnie. Shivam's life    
does change when he meets and falls in love   
with a devout Muslim woman, Aaliyah, who opens
his eyes to compassion and the teachings of   
Pighamber Mohammad. Shivam wants to wed       
Aaliyah, but her father opposes this due to   
Shivam's criminal background, and the fact    
that he has been in prison twice. When Shivam 
insists on getting married regardless of the  
consequences, Aaliyah's dad aims a gun at him,
but Shivam ducks and the bullet hits Aaliyah, 
killing her instantly. Shivam returns to his
