Ed Falco has delivered a narrative that fits in well with the Puzo themes of violence, respect and life-is-cheap finality in the mob world. He describes how Vito Corleone went about building his power among the crime families of New York in 1933, adjusting for the coming end of Prohibition. YouΓÇÖll revisit the Barzini, Pentangeli and Tattaglia clans.

But that material has been well mined, both in the original book and the movies. So Falco concentrates on the younger players, specifically the reckless and ambitious 17-year-old Sonny, VitoΓÇÖs oldest child, and Tom Hagen, the Irish orphan brought into the Corleone household and raised like a son.
Falco also gives prominence to Luca Brasi as a hulking, dark and tormented eminence who is feared by all. The origins of his brutal nature are explored as he goes from being an independent gang leader to become the loyal enforcer for Don Corleone.

But it is primarily SonnyΓÇÖs tale, as he secretly runs his own small-time gang and tries to convince his father he is worthy of following him in the family business. Siblings Michael, Fredo and Connie pretty much stay in the background as Sonny goes from mistress to mischief, courting Falco-created danger that falls short of PuzoΓÇÖs audacious horse-head-in-bed turns.

For Corleone enthusiasts, however, it adds vital statistics ΓÇö and a Sicilian-dialect glossary ΓÇö to the family myth.
