With an estimated 35,000 species, terrestrial molluscs are one of the most successful and diverse animal groups in land-based ecosystems. These animals have long been of importance to human societies as food, medicine, crop pests, vectors of parasites, and as tools, personal ornamentation and currency in trade. This book presents a synthesis of current knowledge and research on the biology of terrestrial molluscs.
