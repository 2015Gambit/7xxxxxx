BloodRayne is a 2002 third-person action-adventure video game and the first game in the BloodRayne series. In addition to a sequel, BloodRayne 2, Bloodrayne inspired a series of films and self-contained comic books. It was developed by Terminal Reality, and was strongly influenced by their previous game Nocturne.
