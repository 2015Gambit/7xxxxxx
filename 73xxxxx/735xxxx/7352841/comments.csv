'Alarming phenomenon' indeed. Especially if you take the warmist propaganda at face value.

Check out the website above - the most comprehensive site in the world for de-bunking the myth that is anthropogenic (i.e. man-made) global warming. "

Global warming is a fact (it is directly observed through global temperature profiles). The atmosphere and oceans are both warming, CO2 is confirmed as the reason for it (through sattelite measurements of the change in IR radiation leaving the troposphere), and fossil fuel burning is confirmed as the cause of the CO2 (through isotope studies and also simple accounting of how much is released). The ice caps are both melting, with land ice declining in Antarctica at a massive rate, and sea-ice volume in the Arctic steadily declining. 

Global warming is a directly observable fact. That's all there is to it.

By the way, you got your own right-wing propaganda website's name wrong, it's '""watts"" up with that'. 

A much better website is www.SkepticalScience.com , which systematically debunks all of the global warming deniers arguments, one by one."

Thanks for this though, I think this is a great vaccine for kids against the all the rabid blogs and other industry-funded misinformation they will later 'discover'.... Cheers!"
