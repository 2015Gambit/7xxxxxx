after restarting system my laptop's keyboard stopped working so I had to use On-Screen Keyboard to do system restore and it worked again, be caution when installing this.."

The above comment by sniperboss86 is either a malicious lie or the work of a Noob,  First of all, this software will not erase anything without your permission.  If it did tag system files (which I seriously doubt) you should be familiar with system files or not be using this powerful and elegant software. Using Windows 7 64-bit.  Thank you for this excellent Up.  ~Punk "
