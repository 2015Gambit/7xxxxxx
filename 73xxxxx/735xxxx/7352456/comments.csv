,artichokehead,2012-06-21T08:15Z,"bruss, great torrent, but i have a problem - i had been playing on an older skidrow version and switched to this one, and i can't find the save location - in fact, there were no .sav files anywhere in the game folder.  could you or anyone else please send me a completed game save so i can start from the beginning of 'the itch,' where i left off?
also, if anyone knows how to play multiplayer or download community maps, a tutorial would be much appreciated.
thanks!"
,bruss.aka.durka9,2012-06-21T11:46Z,"to artichokehead
Too many questions.
Saves located in: /Portal 2/portal2/SAVE/many numbers/"
,KubLama28,2012-06-21T17:29Z,how to rebiuld puzzles here????
,bruss.aka.durka9,2012-06-21T18:27Z,"to KubLama28
Not possibly. Play only."
,artichokehead,2012-06-21T23:17Z,"bruss - thanks for the reply - that's where i thought it would be, but that folder doesn't exist.  i tried playing from the beginning long enough that it autosaved, in hope that the folder would be created.  it wasn't, but i'm still able to load those autosaves in-game.  i guess i'll try reinstalling...?"
,2230411,2012-06-24T18:53Z,"What is the point of puzzle maker, if you can't play the puzzle you created? Nonsense. 
The game crashes when i try to build and play. And when you press ""Rebuild (F9)"" - the map is unresponsive, the doors won't open etc. I don't see a point in uploading bugged release. "
,serpiente89,2012-06-25T01:06Z,thanks
,trash2011,2012-06-27T13:17Z,"System requirements in torrent description are probably for Portal 1. 
Portal 2 requires CPU with SSE2 and video card supporting at least shader model 2.0b.
Unfortunatly I wasted some bandwith"
,Anaklusmos1995,2012-07-06T20:19Z,"Worked perfectly for a day and a half. After that, misteriously started crashing right after initializing the game. Sometimes, it even works up to the menu, but there are only two options: No valve ( which doesn't work) and Quit."
,bruss.aka.durka9,2012-07-07T14:33Z,"to Anaklusmos1995
Off antivirus --> reinstall game --> enjoy."
,Anaklusmos1995,2012-07-14T03:55Z,Thanks

Researched it and it is removed because of a bad rating from: ""Data provided by software publishers"".
Restored and chose to exclude file from scan.
Clean and working!
Thanks!"
,genkifresh,2012-08-25T07:17Z,"google ""Portal 2 - Coop-Launcher""
go to the first result and click on the link provided in the blog. haven't been able to test it out though yet so good luck."
,Pyrogreg,2012-09-05T12:38Z,"Do I need steam to play this? Because when I run ""run_portal_2.exe"" it closes at the loading screen. And when I run ""portal2.exe"" it gets to the menu but just says No Steam and Quit. And I can only pick quit"
