Compression - Control the dynamics

Adjustable compression parameters:

    Attack time: the time it takes to reach the maximum gain reduction level
    Release time: the time needed to reduce gain reduction to 0 when it's no more needed
    Threshold: minimum level of input signal (after Pre gain stage) needed to activate gain reduction
    Ratio: amount of gain reduction applied to the output signal, from 1:1 to +Inf:1, when input exceeds the Threshold



Tube - Hot and loud

COMPrime has a hot tube in it's core. It gives you the famous analog non-linearity that creates a warm and rich sound.
