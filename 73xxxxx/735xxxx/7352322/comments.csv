,gozinya,2012-06-14T04:09Z,"This uploader has also been posting RAR fakes. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and try it, but I doubt it's legit."

,gozinya,2012-06-14T05:26Z,"Hey, easy guys, I apologize, I'm fairly new to this shit. I saw 26K and know that they posted fakes. Sorry for looking in the wrong place, no need to get rude."
,gozinya,2012-06-14T05:39Z,"Again, I'm new to this. I won't post another comment until I am fully versed with the system. No harm intended."
,idkeither,2012-06-14T07:29Z,@gozinya its cool but just remember that green skull and check comments if theres any.
,garet_mc,2012-06-14T07:39Z,"Seeding, but uploading much faster than downloading."
,Petri1968,2012-06-14T07:45Z,"sample is watchable good for cam

a7
v7.5"
,cantones,2012-06-14T08:45Z,"A- 7
V- 7

Good Cam, THANKS"
,l4v4,2012-06-14T08:48Z,"ok, i registered an account just to comment on this.

ok its watchable for a cam. screen is clipped on both sides and focus can take a second.

Arabic subtitles, and there are people talking faintly throughout the move.

also this is 1 hr 49 min
running time is 2 hr 7 min

so im assuming some is missing or it has the worlds longest credits.

A: 6
V: 7

for a cam, not bad but again, some might be missing.

cant someone, somewhere just goto a quiet theater, with an HD cam, set it on a stand or on the back of a chair, and make HD cam rips, like Im sure some kind of camera could record movies perfectly, then that person sell them to whoever.

i would if i could"
,thrawn2112,2012-06-14T10:07Z,"looks way better than what's been available so far, but not as good as i'd want. (cropping/background noise) i'm gonna wait another week to see if anything better comes out and if not i may get this"
,chewy446,2012-06-14T11:12Z,"@gozinya .....One little mistake and the vultures descend to feast ..Everyone on here was once a newbe a fact they tend to forget. 
By the way..it's watchable"
,mutz-nutz,2012-06-14T12:51Z,"well said chewy446, but on the other hand, if you don't know what you're talking about, best not to say anythin. 

l4v4 described the quality well.

thanks froggie"
,BKKJack,2012-06-14T15:07Z,"Why have all the other arsehole Release Groups put this up too?

Are they at each other's throats, trying to pass this off as their own work?

Theres about 10 of these torrents gone up today"
,lordkolos,2012-06-14T15:53Z,"No offense but I want to wait, till a DVDRIP is uploaded or I go to a 3D Theatre.... I was waiting for this movie since a long time and dont want to spoil it on some low quality CamRip..."
,Calumbiran,2012-06-14T16:13Z,"decent cam copy,watchable. thank you froggie100."
,Fritz.,2012-06-14T16:45Z,"@bkkjack  thats really normal for this site. there is about a dozen common uploaders and they all upload the same videos.

pretty much 100% of the time the uploader is not the person who recorded the movie, they just got it from another source and are seeding it for us.

maybe about 10% of the time the uploader will do something like adjust the video or sound to try and improve it before they begin seeding, but like i said its pretty rare.

as far as them being at each others throats, who knows, this is all some type of internet popularity contest anyhow. its like some people have this need to be famous, or infamous.

...the thing is historic infamous figures generally got paid for being outlaws. billy the kid, bonnie and clyde, al capone, and so on were out to get paid... they didnt do it for free just to be popular."
,ashsama,2012-06-14T17:40Z,"Too much cropping of the edges, title intro shows only ""OMETHEU"" so you have a fair understanding how much you're missing of the movie.

Thanks for the upload though - you upload the best avaible at the moment - no fault in that.
Though I'll wait for a release where I won't miss 20% of the movie :)"
,professorjpj,2012-06-14T18:35Z,"I make a living(or try to) from selling these, but after seeing the sample, and the screenshots, I have to say, these are NOT sellable!  Probably better versions from the mexican cams!  We REALLY need an r5, screener, please someone find one and post it!"
,tverlaine,2012-06-14T19:02Z,"'professorjpj' You sir do not belong on Pirate Bay at all. Trying to make a living selling something that someone has generously 'shared' freely to you. So many things wrong with what you are doing,but to mention this as part of a criticism is unbelievably ignorant. You sir are a moral leper!"
,tverlaine,2012-06-14T19:04Z,Sorry froggie I forgot to thank you for your time and work.I was thrown for a loop from that moron.
,stinkyKuntz,2012-06-14T19:06Z,"waiting for better and the froggie comes through,thank you frog"
,tverlaine,2012-06-14T19:06Z,"Sorry froggie forgot to thank you which was my first intention,but was sidetracked by a dope."
,stinkyKuntz,2012-06-14T19:14Z,"i'm not getting anything on download for 15 mins ,start seeding you greedy cockbiters"
,stinkyKuntz,2012-06-14T19:19Z,"spread the seed you worthless greedbags,help the needy spread some seedy.......NOW"
,Colossal_Bastard,2012-06-14T20:34Z,professorjpj is a massive cunt.
,bubbanuggzz,2012-06-14T21:02Z,"watchable I guess,but the movie is boring & the info is half bullshit.sure your missing a minute or so @ about the 40min mark,but what about the 10 minutes that are missing 30mins after that.not that it matters,just 10 more minutes of predictable shit.+1 for your clean up work thou froggie "
,mysticbluebmw,2012-06-15T01:41Z,"Video is average CAM quality, ie..not great...what one would expect for a CAM.

Audio, on the other hand is terrible.  After 10 minutes, I stopped watching, because I could not understand one word, not one.  It sounds like you are listening to it through a tube.  More closely would be that the whole movie sounds like the teachers in the Charlie Brown TV shows.  That and the added bonus of what sounded like EVERYONE in the movie theater talking. Really, it was that bad.  Anyone else who says differently is candy coating it.

So, while video is watchable, audio is the worst I have ever experienced.

Oh, and so you know my setup, my computer is hooked up to my Onkyo HT Receiver through HDMI and then HDMI from that to my TV, and I use VLC player.  It's the same when trying to just watch on the computer as well."

,excelguy,2012-06-15T09:07Z,Totally unwatchable. 
,fazilcent,2012-06-15T12:24Z,"what the fuck do you mean by cam and hd,, its not possible, if its cam its bullshit and if its hd its awesome,, it just cant be bullshitly awesome at the same time..  but unfortunately people like you must be removed because of your retard-ness"
,balrog814,2012-06-15T14:37Z,"gozinya, how can sone be new to this? Everyone should be here since day one. Latecomers are walking shames :)"
,roflma00,2012-06-15T18:19Z,@fazilcent i think he means filmed with a HD cam which would make it a HD resolution cam copy. get it?
,f-hollywood,2012-06-16T00:25Z,"Ok forget the A/V quality, the movie just plainly sucks, look @ the ones that are saying + comments, they leave a website to goto--clearly a con!  For the movie, I don't think I have seen a movie where I wanted the cast to die, I actually was rooting for the characters to die, they are that stupid in the movie. Ridley needs to retire, for ripping off his own movie. Can't anybody come up w/ an original idea anymore---they get paid enough. Save your $$ and rent ALIEN. "

,DantheMan5000,2012-06-18T06:49Z,"Much better than previous cams out there, as far as clarity. The biggest issue is you don't see above the actors eyebrows for most of the movie. In some scenes the heads are cut off entirely. The effort is appreciated but, I recommend waiting for a better copy."
,Sbouibas,2012-06-18T12:52Z,thx
,rakish88,2012-06-24T07:58Z,"I loved the Darknes Riddley can bring to his movies. This is why he is my favorite SF producer, he really knows his work. I've watshed this on movies.capturing.tv because their quality really is the best atm."

,mammerjam,2012-07-14T03:58Z,for one professorjpj needs the firing squad for being a useless lifeform!!!!!!! the next thing is people need to stop bitching and being such assholes when they arent even the ones risking anything recording a movie in a theater get a life or quit your bitching.... this shit is free so shut the fuck up
,Mentaltown72,2012-07-24T00:46Z,"Don't even bother with this one. A/V 7? Not even close. Trust me. Have some patience & wait for a DVD rip upload. Come on people, you should know better by now. Cheers :)"
,ZFRainbow,2012-08-17T11:23Z,"Are you serious!? The quality is not all that bad, but missing 2/5 of the screen (one on each side), you hear dumb ppl mouthing off right off the start like its a damned living room, not to mention the poor quality of sound.
Tks for the effort, but I will wait a bit longer.
