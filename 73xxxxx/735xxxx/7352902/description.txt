Jorge Zarou a.k.a Jorg3 is a gifted painter and a promising musician. He started out his music career at the age of six when he received his first guitar. 
He went on to discover rock and classical music before becoming obsessed with computers and electronic music. 
His musical explorations have taken him through many different types of music including electro, dub,techno and any type of music with a beat, in general. 
His style is unique, deep, atmospheric and he's trying to find the balance between full-on and progressive Psy-Trance, without sticking to the same old tried and tested formula, by using melodic, driving, yet surprisingly hard-hitting and evocative sounds.

He has released several tracks in the past, and this period he is a signed artist of Inner Lotus Records.
