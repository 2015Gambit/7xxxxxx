for example rather than downloading this you could download and seed the one of the other peoples torrents that uploaded the EAT cracked version.

This is a non stop issue at TPB
no one uses the search engine and you have a TON of torrents with  handful of seeders instead of one or 2 torrents with 1,000's of high speed seeders.

Why does this happen so much at TPB ?
the only conclusion i can think of is Vanity. People want to develop a reputation around here, so there is always a ton of people jockeying for popularity.
LOL gotta love the internet.. nothing ever changes ;)"
