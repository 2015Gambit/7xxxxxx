I have met many people in China who could not distinguish between Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans or Russians - neither by sight nor by hearing them speak. I simply pointed out the difference to them without any insults. It never occurred to me that I could take such a hard line against such minor errors. But the next time I go to China I'm really gonna let 'em have it!

Thanks for inspiring me, baronww1.

P.S. Anybody know any good insults in Chinese? Like, for example, ""dipshit""? My Mandarin teachers never taught me any."
