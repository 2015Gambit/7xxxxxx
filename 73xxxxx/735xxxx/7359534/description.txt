This is a 720p re-encode from a 720p source.

Each episode is 890mb or smaller and the quality is just about the same as the original. Save your hard drive space and bandwidth, while keeping the benifits of the beauty that is HD 720p. Some call this m720p I call it common sense!

All the files are named according to the episode title and don't have any of that annoying crap afterwards

I hope you all enjoy it.



Also do your mind a favor and watch Thrive the Movie
