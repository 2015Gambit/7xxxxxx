My upload speed is about .2kbps, so it's painstakingly slow. I'll get a 100% ratio in about 36 hours at the current rate."
,CaliStyle,2012-06-14T04:57Z,"upload to ""sendspace"" and provide a link i'll help you seed."
,DirtyH,2012-06-14T21:00Z,"Thanks, it's gonna take about a half hour to upload, but I'm leaving right about now. I'll send it to you when I get back tonight."
,DirtyH,2012-06-15T19:00Z,"Download link for those who want to help seed so we can actually get this off the ground haha.

,DirtyH,2012-06-15T20:58Z,"Thanks to those who helped this finally get off the ground! Like I said in the description, please support the band. I would be lying if I said I bought all of my music, but I do my best to make it the concerts when artists I like are in town or at least buy some merch every now and then. It's a great album for the summertime, hope everyone enjoys! Only mistake I made is that there is a chunk of the song ""Notice"" at the beginning of ""Your Love"". If it's a huge deal to you, then just cut it out with audacity. "
