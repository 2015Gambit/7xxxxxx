The new Dirty Heads album. I ripped it from Spotify. The quality sounds good to me, but I have yet to pump up the volume on it and see what is sounds like. I made this rip for my personal use until the album comes out on June 19th, and I figured I might as well share it. This is my first torrent, so I apologize if there are any errors. I have low bandwidth, so please seed after you download to allow the torrent to get off the ground. 

Also, PLEASE support these guys. I already have a signed copy of the album preordered and am seeing them live for a second time this summer. Been following them for years, and they're a great group of musicians and they really do work their asses off making music for our entertainment. Whether it's merch, albums, or shows, please do something! Thanks!
