,Fritz.,2012-06-15T16:13Z,"i would normally disagree ironyman as the average reading ability of the general public is at the 6th grade level these days which just goes to show how mentally handi-capped the general public really is.

sure there are smart people out there... the thing is they are so vastly outnumbered by stupid people these days that it doesnt change the fact the general public is dumb."
,amirjason,2012-06-16T00:34Z,I would really agree on what Fritz. said. Most of the General Public really is dumb. They don't even know how to internalize the message or the value they get on an inspiring movie. They just love the visual scenes and not the content the movie bring.
,kris_tof,2012-06-16T18:48Z,"Although IMDB's ratings arent always reliable, they give a good indication of how a movie is. This one got a 4.5/10 rating from 1,600 users, so I feel its safe to say that this is probably shit."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-06-18T00:36Z,"This movie was finished in 2008 , So it kinda shows what faith the makers had in it to take 4 years to release it ."

,FictionRyu,2012-07-08T21:57Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name 
Actually, A Thousand Words was indeed originally filmed in 2008, to be released in 2009, but it was repeatedly delayed after being caught up in the separation of DreamWorks from Paramount and Viacom. You are probably one of the general public. If you had the time to pay attnetion to the fact is was originally filmed in '08, but not to actually know WHY it didn't get released 'till now, then you are part of the general public. "
,FictionRyu,2012-07-08T22:01Z,"And also, Coffeeman2cups..how much coffee have you had when you typed your comment? You're part of the problem of the general public. You're an ignorant asshole who will tell an actor to go die, but you probably don't have the 'balls' to tell that right to Eddies face. Not that that matters much anyway becuase the ignorance of one teeny tiny insect such as yourself, has no effect that people watched it, and Eddie still got paid. "
,Zenophobe,2012-07-11T13:03Z,let's see... cast features...  Eddie Murphy.  Instant pass.  Thank you.
,flexzi,2012-07-13T00:02Z,"I thought Eddie's ""Meet Dave"" was great fun..
