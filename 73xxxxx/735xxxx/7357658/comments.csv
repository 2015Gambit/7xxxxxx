,TheBanner,2012-06-16T08:59Z,"You ppl really suck , stop trying to ruin our PS3s ... 3.55 is the highest firmware available right now ...  anything above it is FAKE ...

You didn't mention if it was 3.55 or higher !!! WTF ?! But I think that you CLAIM it's higher right uploader ? -.-"
,mrzone6,2012-06-26T20:13Z,"Why is everyone on here saying 3.55 is the latest firmware??? 3.55 was released December 7th, 2010. Since 3.55 there have been 11 FIRMWARE UPDATES.

THE LATEST IS FIRMWARE 4.20 RELEASED JUNE 20, 2012

Also, the uploader zipped his whole desktop so you do not need all the files."
