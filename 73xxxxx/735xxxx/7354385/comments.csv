,nileshtambe,2012-06-16T02:11Z,"yes it does have aero
for update do for driver install only
otherwise 
Windows update doesn't like if you touch WinSxS. It will just install the system update readiness tool, which will re-install a bunch of shit into WinSxS, and then updates will fail because they attempt to update stuff that doesn't exist.

Some updates will install, others will not. Generally, the ones that will not install is due to stuff being removed, and it can't update what isn't there. "

,TestSmith,2012-06-18T04:56Z,This contains malware in particular the KMS-Tr3bivatoR
,nileshtambe,2012-06-18T15:17Z,"KMS-Tr3bivatoR is activator like windows loader
its in separate folder not in iso file if u dont like u can delete it, use ur own key or activaton method to activate, windows loader sometimes doesnt work on professional so given this activator which perfectly works 100%."
,TestSmith,2012-06-18T22:37Z,I tried to install this however it freezes on me after the installation files have loaded. I also tried to do a install from inside windows and i get the following error. Windows could not load required file winsetup.dll. The file may be corrupt. I assume this what caused the installation to freeze. Any ideas how to fix this.
,nileshtambe,2012-06-18T22:54Z,format the drive and do fresh install u should not get install error iso is thoroughly tested for error
,TestSmith,2012-06-18T23:10Z,For me to format the drive i will need to install the window files to do a clean install and since this freezes on me i cant do the format.
,l.flynt,2012-06-19T01:02Z,"Finaly finished dload (shame on u seeders), installed it nd everything goin well so far except my av did also give a detection on the activator nd moved it to quarantine so I couldn't use that but 7loader worked gr8, otherwise nice work nileshtambe"
,TestSmith,2012-06-19T13:29Z,"I found what the problem was it was the Logitech keyboard wireless and wireless mouse. They don't work with installs. However i did have a spare mouse and keyboard which so happen to be wireless but they both work. The install was great and the KMS-Tr3bivatoR worked.

However i did find the modifications that you made were to restrictive. I needed the MS Frame work which i could not install. Perhaps you can do another version with the MS network."
