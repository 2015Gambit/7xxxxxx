Hi!

Thanks for downloading my SuicideGirls Collectible Playing Cards template.
There are 54 complete standard playing cards, each with a SuicideGirl (or 2) on its face.

I've included JPEGs of all 54 cards, and the card back image. 
As well as PNGs of the original files, so you may move the suit symobols, numbers, 
placement of the picture, or even replace the picture with one you like better! 

I'm also working on a SuicideGirls Collectible Card Game (SGCCG), similar to, say, "Magic: The Gathering," or "Pokemon."
If you're interested in that, please send an email to
I will keep you apprised, of what I'm doing, and when I finish the game.
If you're willing to offer some help in some way, please say to in the email! I would love truly love some help.


Please positive, or negative comment!
