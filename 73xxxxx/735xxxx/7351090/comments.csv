,contatnt1one,2012-06-13T18:23Z,Amazing and Ultimate Spider-Man universe crossover?! Please no.  Tell me this is not going to be Marvel's version of earth one and two. The Ultimate universe sucks. I wish it would just go the way of malibu and the avengers next universe.
,Uriz3n,2012-06-13T19:07Z,"The Ultimate Universe (Ultimatum not withstanding) is the best thing that happened to Marvel in the last 15 years. That and Astonishing X-Men (until Whedon and Ellis stopped writing).
""One more Day""? ""Brand New Day""? All the X-Men crap? Dan Slott? 60 years of convoluted continuity? 
Sorry, but the Ultimate Universe has had consistently better quality in both art and storytelling, not to mention you don't have to buy 50 different titles to know what's going on..."
,CorpusM,2012-06-14T00:51Z,"I think Miles really needed this as a character anyways. So far the only connection he has to the original Spider-Man is being there when he died and having Gwen tell him ol' Uncle Bens famous phrase. I Think having him meet a version of who he is supposed to be will help him develop into the spider-man he should be. Plus, having Peter come to a universe where is dead should be interesting."
,tgrphnx,2012-07-02T00:54Z,"I gotta agree with CorpusM.  This can only bring good things. Amazing Spider-man is getting a bit stale and it might shake things up for Peter to realize that re can actually die (for good.) Whereas Miles ""plays"" as Spider-man without really knowing what Spidey was really like (even though Pete's not the ultimates version there's still many similarities).  I guess we'll see how it turns out."

Wtf you are not and avid comic book reader or not a marvel fan but i guess a Google or wiki search was too much for you to know that marvel has a for a long time setup a multiverse to keep stories in line and its not as simple as earth 1 and 2...... dipshit"
