 In a small fishing village live childhood
 friends, Mona D'Silva (Dimple Kapadia),  
 and Raja (Kamaal Hasan). Mona and her dad
 Mr. D'Silva (Saeed Jaffrey) run a small  
 restaurant. Raja has no family but treats
 Miss Joseph (Nadira) as his mother.      
 He plans to marry Mona one day, but is   
 afraid to tell her of his love for her.  
 When wealthy Ravi (Rishi Kapoor) comes to
 live with his grandmother, Kamladevi     
 (Madhur Jaffrey), he sees Mona and       
 falls in love with her. They meet and    
 Mona also reciprocates his love.         
 Raja is devastated by this, but does     
 not tell anyone, except Miss Joseph of   
 his pain and sorrow.
