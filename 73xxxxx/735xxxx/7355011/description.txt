These are the Marvel comics I got from the week beginning 6/13/2012.  These are not a complete list of what Marvel put out this week.  There are other torrents for that. There are 12 titles in this week's offering. 

All comics are either in CBR or CBZ format and are labelled individually.  Please do not share my descriptions or torrent ads with anyone without messaging me first.  If this torrent has no seeds please msg me privately.  I will be glad to reup anything that has no seeds.
