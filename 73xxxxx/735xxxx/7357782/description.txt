How does this wonderful book help you build great fluency?
  	

If youΓÇÖre trying to achieve a good command of fluency-relevant vocabulary, a conventional thesaurus wonΓÇÖt be of much help ΓÇö no matter how helpful it may be for other purposes. This is so whether itΓÇÖs a Roget-style thesaurus or a dictionary-style thesaurus.

To achieve a good command of fluency-relevant vocabulary, you need dedicated fluency-oriented vocabulary building books ΓÇö books that focus on fluency-building vocabulary.

And the Core Fluency Thesaurus is a dedicated fluency-oriented vocabulary building book ΓÇö and the first thesaurus of its kind. From none other than Prof. Kev Nair, the worldΓÇÖs foremost authority on fluency building. And it groups together, under headwords, word groups that express meanings similar to, or somewhat similar to, its important meanings. These are groups of words that individual words tend to form with other words, with a more-than-chance frequency: Phrases, collocations, phrasal verbs, idioms and other multi-word items that have the property of adding to your fluency. The author has marked how relatively frequent/important (for fluency training) a headword is with the indicators ΓÇÿAAAΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿAAΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿAΓÇÖ. Headwords marked ΓÇÿAAAΓÇÖ are more frequent/important than those marked ΓÇÿAAΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿAΓÇÖ. And headwords marked ΓÇÿAAΓÇÖ are more frequent/important than those marked ΓÇÿAΓÇÖ.

If youΓÇÖre an advanced user of English ΓÇô someone who has to make heavy use of fluent English in his/her everyday life ΓÇô you need this book.

uploader's note:

I would have said "buy it if you like the book" in any of my other uploads but Iam not going to say that to this book.

Because of their stupid DRM protection in all of their ebooks. You can't use DRM encrypted books to personalize or you know add comments for our own use. 

Just look at these stupid restrictions they impose on the buyer:

Copying text 	Not Allowed
Modifying text 	Not Allowed
Delivery mode 	Online (over the Internet)
Buyer information 	Embedded in each file

So I can't take physical printouts of my purchase or copy text for my own legal personal use? You expect me to buy your books by you treating your potential customers like criminals? How will you know what buyer pirated your books if they scanned the books of the physical version and upload them?
