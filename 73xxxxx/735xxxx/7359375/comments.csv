If you are waiting for a great Sci Fi akin to Aliens Franchise, you wont get it here. Shitty movie."

,serialdownloader,2012-06-17T21:31Z,"Thanks, it's probably the best version around for now. I wonder why it takes so long for a TS version to appear..."

,appleburn,2012-06-18T06:39Z,"shit copy...Hard coded Arabic subs, people talking in background, not as blurry as others but still blurry, sound is hard to make out, all in all it's unwatchable imo..Thanks for the upload anyway.

,lilj8371,2012-06-19T21:24Z,Is this still hard coded Arabic subs?
,ferrakins,2012-06-20T00:46Z,"the subtitles are there

i think this quality is good for a cam and the sound is fine too - theres people talking away in the background for the first few mins and someone with a french accent asking if they could restart the movie cos she missed the start and then that she was going cross eyed - id say her eyes were twisted before she even came in.

thanks for the upload tykoon123"
,FrozenApe,2012-06-20T20:07Z,"Jeezus, isn't there one person in the entire world that knows how to film a cam with a pro mic?? Isn't there one person that can release a GOOD cam version here at TPB????  

So many tards praising these shite cam jobs. Better not to release than to release crappy crap.

,iamsith,2012-06-22T02:29Z,rofl my ass off FrozenApe.... arab whore house setting... i keep laughing at that
,Bender5.0,2012-06-23T15:21Z,"Thanks to the uploader first and foremost. 
This is a cam copy right - so straight away it's going to be average at best. This one has poor quality sound, background chatter that does stop if you can tolerate it long enough (which the recorder can't do anything about) and average video at best with hard coded subs. Is it watchable? Yes, absolutely. But it's crap on a big screen - or anything other than a laptop or pc sized lcd. 
If V10 is blueray, then this is 3. If clean and crisp dolby or better audio is a 10, then this is also a 3, and a 2 at times. 
Let's not mince words - it's crap compared to BR or even DVD. But it's here and it is watchable, and right now it's watch it or pay to see it. So again, that's why I thank the uploader for the effort. 
So A and V 3. 

As for the plot and movie itself - stop reading now if you don't want to know; I was expecting more from a Ridley Scott film. Some here love it, I'm not one of them. I personally think it's a case of massive potential, that misses the mark almost completely. Definitely not worth the hype. Poor casting with a weak and *very* predictably plot. It does somewhat answer where the Aliens come from, or originate from - or at least it tries to with some circular logic. I won't say more as it will ruin the predictable surprise.

So watch it and make up your own mind on the movie. But don't expect high quality."
,Bender5.0,2012-06-23T15:25Z,PS: THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT AN AVI XVID!!

,Fritz.,2012-07-29T09:32Z,"watchable.

the people talking in the background go away after the first 10 minutes or so, but it is obnoxious at first.

as for the movie... it wasnt terrible, but i sort of expected more.

i felt the ending was rather poor. the ending does not provide closure and the explanation for the aliens just doesnt make much sense when compared to the aliens coming out of the eggs in all of the alien movies, or the fact they burst out of the host still in a larval form.

im sure someone can use their imagination and extrapolate some type of correlation by just making stuff up, but this movie did a poor job of relating to the previous titles in my opinion."
