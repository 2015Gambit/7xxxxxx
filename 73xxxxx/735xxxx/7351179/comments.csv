,znavy264,2012-06-14T09:27Z,"I'm Sorry YIFI, this is not 1080p BR quality.  The compression is so bad you completely screwed up the HD part.  Just because the screen is in 1080p SIZE, doesn't mean that it's a 1080p HD resolution.  A normal DVD rip is higher quality than this.

Try this TRUE 1080p BRrip instead:

,divya88,2012-06-14T16:31Z,"@BitchMovies & znavy264: Hey Assholes, try looking at the size of the two versions. Maybe the quality of BOZX is say 50% better than that of YIFY, still the size is 650% times! Go waste your worthless time on BOZX."
,pkisme,2012-06-14T16:49Z,"@BitchMovies - i dunno which era u are still living it... just because u can't play something properly on PS3... oh wait, aren't u supposed to do ur homework?"
,BitchMovies,2012-06-14T18:25Z,Listen yify Can you please do your movies in 1080p and avi avi on ps3 does not have a cinvrea warning and avi will be very nice 
,Shizty,2012-06-14T20:06Z,I love YIFY keep doing what u do and fuck ps3.
,sexdwarf777,2012-06-15T00:16Z,"Thanks YIFY but I'd say 720p for 1.5Gb would be just fine, IMO there are no reasonable points to put so large resolution into that small filesize. On large monitors image's deficiency is clearly visible, while on small ones such resolution is just useless."
,Munchkinpuncher,2012-06-15T04:03Z,Thanks Yify you rock. Fuck these haters.
,gabrijel1,2012-06-15T08:31Z,Best quality

,DamnitDoll2012,2012-06-17T07:51Z,Bad Audio!!!!! mutes about twenty minutes in and a message comes up about it is temporarily muted because it is protected by cinivia. Just wanted eveyone with a blu-ray player to be warned about the bad audio!!!!!

Thanks in advance"
,Nemo202020,2012-06-17T19:13Z,"Thank u YIFY , Beast ."
,psychoacer,2012-06-17T21:57Z,"@bronsongotn
If it's below Dvd quality then why not get the dvd rip at half the size? You will get about the same quality if not better since it's image is 10x smaller while the bitrate is only cut in half. That means more data is used to represent each image per second. The image size has nothing to do with quality. It's really about pixel density."

,natedude,2012-06-19T07:07Z,"I've had problems getting this to play. I have the current version of VLC media player, and while I can hear the sound, theres no picture. This may just be me, although I have reset the player to the defaults. I did get it to play in WMP but I got some skipping every six seconds or so.

It looks to be amazing quality, but I couldn't get it working."
,natedude,2012-06-19T07:12Z,"NEVERMIND PREVIOUS COMMENT

It is a problem with my side, I am having the same problem with other videos in x264. This is a great torrent, legit."
,agoraintl,2012-06-21T01:59Z,Thx YIFY
,peachville,2012-06-22T22:44Z,"As usual, the smallest size and best A/V quality. YIFY you are IT!  Like most downloaders, I watch the CAM releases but never give a movie permanent hard drive space till the YIFY release. :)
