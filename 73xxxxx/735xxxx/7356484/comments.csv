Some users like to get pissy for no real reason, it makes 'em feel better about sitting at their computer in saggy underwear drinking beer or something... don't sweat that part."
,zeodas,2012-06-16T21:11Z,Big thanks for this! Now i see the downloaded content option! but i my game still crash at cambria :(
,kaliver,2012-06-22T13:19Z,"yeah, Cambria crash was a bug in the game itself that the developer hotfixed. ultimately, with these games from smaller studios that release numerous patches, you will have to wait a long time for a fully patched final version or support the devs and buy the game. i will opt for the latter once i can get it half off on steam."
