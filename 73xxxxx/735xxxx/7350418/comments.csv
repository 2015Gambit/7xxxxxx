(I wouldn't even go near a comuter then!)
That VCR has been gone for for a long time.

Over the years, I thought that the tapes had also been lost had been lost until one day I opened up some old boxes that had moved with me from state to state and there they sat.
I had an newer VCR so I popped them in.
Amazingly they were still in the same condition as they were the day I got them!

I'm also still an avid Stevie Nicks/Fleetword Mac fan but tech knowledge (back then I wouldn't go near a computer) and my tape to DVD skills have greatly improved.

I'd always had wanted to immortalize these videos, and thanks to the new age, I can now do that.

Granted it's only a broadcast to vhs dub (the only thing available back then) recently transvered to DVD, I am sure the large fan base of Fleetwood Fanatics will enjoy this look back to the 90's when George Bush Jr. was still an unknown and DVD's had just hit the scene!"
