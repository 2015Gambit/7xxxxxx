Untamed China With Nigel Marven
China is the fourth largest country on the Planet at almost ten million square kilometres and one of the most diverse. Covering seven percent of the Earth's land surface, China s landscapes are vast, varied and spectacular with grasslands, deserts, mountains and jungles. In this extraordinary series, wildlife adventurer Nigel Marven (Walking with Dinosaurs, Prehistoric Park) crosses its greatest deserts to encounter sand swimming snakes and Bactrian camels, treks through its deepest jungles to discover the white-cheeked gibbon, huge pythons and enormous rats and climbs the Sichuan Mountains where he sees blue sheep, yak and searches forests for unique breeds of frogs. He unveils creatures, scenery and customs never seen on our screens before, from tropical jewels and Tibetan treasures to fertile grasslands and bamboo forests. He meets some bizarre and deadly reptiles and amphibians, enjoys the fairy-tale lifecycle of butterflies and gets up close and personal with giant panda cubs at Chengdu s world-famous breeding centre.


3)  Land of Giants 
Nigel explores the jungles of southern China, where he finds white-cheeked gibbon, rare Asian elephants, pythons, enormous rats, and the world's largest species of moth.
