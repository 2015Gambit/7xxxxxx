,MikeyMetal,2012-06-16T02:39Z,"1080i is stunning. The difference is night and day compared to 1080p. I watch Game of Thrones and the 1080i files are jaw dropping and the 1080p are throwaways. 
Thanks for this Nepotu. A legend you are, as always.  :)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-06-16T04:35Z,"@Maunopieru: Yes, you have right. In fact FullHD means that an AV equipment can display all available HD resolutions up to 1080p (is logical, no?)
@MikeyMetal: Always a pleasure. You are welcome, my friend!"
