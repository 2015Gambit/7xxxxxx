This is my first Torrent so bear with me. These are the 2 CD's for the game Citizen Kabuto. This torrent is for those missing one or more of the CD's but legitimately own the game. If you do not own the game, you may purchase it, probably from Ebay, Amazon, or download it from Good old games. Unfortunately Planet Moon Studios no longer supports their game. In fact, I think they may even be disbanded.

In the zip file, there is also included, the two current patches, 1.4, last official patch, and the 1.497 that is promised to become 1.5 eventually according to giantswd.org

You should be able to find a lot of stuff from Giantswd.org because the website is dedicated to the game and has many maps, the 1.497 patch, and tutorial-type things to help you with the editor and such.

I also included the manual. I forget exactly where I downloaded that one.

Gamespy Arcade is also included. It was the latest version I could find, and I found it by google searching it and clicking on the fileplanet result. Feel free to look for a later version.

In fact, everything in that zip file can be found online somewhere.
