(Trojan.Patchep!sys)

This was not a false warning. "
,johnjacob87,2012-06-13T18:55Z,"@ufodave1947
Virus from a VIP??"
,MTeo567,2012-06-13T19:34Z,Ugly to say but here u can trust only extremezone and few other.
,scyris99,2012-06-13T19:56Z,"Norton/Mcaffe products aren't the best for a anti virus, they let alot of stuff slip by because people can code the viruses to bypass those 2. Not to mention Norton/Mcaffe stuff burrows itself so deep into your system that if you ever uninstall it you end up having to format and reinstall your os because it destroys it half the time.

I see 48+ Seeders can anyone confirm if this has a virus or not?"
,VegitoDBZ,2012-06-13T20:05Z,WTF is PublicHD?
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-06-13T22:58Z,"ufodave1947: lol, you gotta grow up man, you should start learning what False Positive really is! (Only if your comment is true)"
,SSJASON,2012-06-14T00:24Z,I've downloaded a ton of DibyaTPB's stuff and it has never been infected. Stop downloading torrents if you use Norton as protection.
,OmniNegro,2012-06-14T01:47Z,"Only the greatest of fools says their false positive idiot warning is not a false positive.

Go fuck yourself crybabies. No VIP Seeds malware. Your fucking idiotic scare-tactics will not work here. No-one believes you or your shitty antiviral crap.

All that paranoid antiviral shit is broken from the start. They would detect half the content of the free world as trojans. Uninstall that shit. Use Clamwin and actively scan things yourself. 

Do not be led around on a choke-chain by your lord and savior antiviral shit."
,MicroBalls,2012-06-14T21:23Z,"Get a real internet security program before you complain about some generic trojan. I can recommend F-Secure Internet Security, but if you pirate it you wont get updates automatically so better buy it."
,Shtefu,2012-06-15T00:18Z,I'll ask the same question by VegitoDBZ: What is public HD?
,minhsan,2012-06-15T03:01Z,"PublicHD is a torrent site, i mean its literally at the top of the info so LEARN TO READ"
,charlene17,2012-06-16T02:08Z,"It's so easy to mouth up with the false positive and so on !
But find out by yourself.... When ping.exe will be used by the installer and you'll find yourself connected to a 83.133.124.191 site and full of unknown processes first in UDP then TCP.
Win32.ZAccta ess.k
win32.refef.TA.trojan

stay away from every skidrow release of this game (and by the way there's really nothing thrilling about it) 

EDIT : 2 hours of work to get rid of a nice rootkit infecting the TCP/IP stack,, nice work guys for a shitty game !"
,Shtefu,2012-06-17T07:13Z,"I was under the impression that [PublicHD] stands for some group that makes repacks, not sure what's the point of promoting another Torrent site in your title.

But yes I'm aware there's a site now at the start of the info but I do not dare to click any links in info files with exception of images from movie screens and such. Better safe than sorry.

Did someone else had same or similar experience as charlene17?"
,2-K,2012-06-19T21:40Z,hey dibyaTPB would you please upload the new patch
,_Menace_,2012-06-21T01:46Z,pls someone post the new patch
,Rahm2197,2012-06-21T03:24Z,"Slight problem - nothing to major about the game. Whenever I alt tab out and then back in, it returns in a windowed form despite my settings, but it widens by just a few millimeters messing up the syncronization (i.e. I have to click a little to the left of anything to actually click on it) Is this a problem with the game that just needs to be patched? Or is it a problem with the torrent itself"
,_Menace_,2012-06-21T11:39Z,"@Rahm2197 thats a problem from the own game this is the launch version, which is bugged as shit"
,_Menace_,2012-06-22T18:22Z,"srsly guys, new patch ploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxploxplox"
,Tourniquest,2012-07-03T11:23Z,"Since it seems the developers are trolling this thread:

Don't buy THIS GAME!! Fatshark accidentaly released the game with a ViRUS!! I had to buy a new computer after buying Krater. Only the Skidrow release is clean. It's the only way to play the game safely!

Seriously, I think it's stupid of them to try to give their own game a bad reputation.

VirusTotal gave the setup file one positive (suspicios file) and nothing else when scanned with 42 antivirus programs.
https://www.virustotal.com/file/ab3641864fc450d7ff15340ced4325f87d28b437eb5ffd367fb9085e9789723e/analysis/

The installed exe files are entirely clean, as are the Skidrow files.

But DO buy the game if you like it. It isn't expensive. I suppose the developers can't be blamed for being morons trying to protect their product."
,v7DusK,2012-07-12T02:51Z,@Rahm2197... Press alt + enter for fullscreen from windowed mode.
,GeneralTso92,2012-07-22T01:15Z,"@OmniNegro

Thats ridiculous.
All anti-virus is bad, except for DIY?

Seriously?
Norton is absolutely bad, there is no argument there, but alot of it is pretty damn good.

Also, you really shouldn't trust yourself with scanning and dealing with viruses personally unless you absolutely know what your doing... which the average person doesn't know."

,Citzen92,2012-07-26T11:30Z,"@Tourniquest know it friend, freaks are developing games today, because they have the money - country is giving money to them, while talented people with fresh and new ideas are pushed aside. Releasing official games with virus inside sounds ridiculous - but its true."
,Guiraud,2012-08-03T15:20Z,"I'm having problems with the game. Tried to install twice, didn't work. Starts the game and when i click on ""play off line"", games shuts down. Does someone can help?   Thanks"
,11770,2012-08-10T16:47Z,"so, Tourniquest does this 1 contain said virus?"
