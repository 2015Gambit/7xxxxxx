RELEASE NOTES

Krater is a squad based roleplaying game set in a colorful
post-apocalyptic world. It combines the combat mechanics of action-rpgs
with the top-down view of the classic old-school RPG and RTS games.

The game brings you far into the future of a post-apocalyptic Sweden.
Once home to IKEA, Vikings and Minecraft, today its primitive
inhabitants scavenge the broken overgrown world for technological
artifacts.

At the rim of an impact site known as the Krater, three factions vie
for control over the wound opening up into the world below. Consisting
of an endless series of caves and tunnels filled with old world
treasures and perils, the Underside stretches into the depths of the
fallen Swedish civilization.

You arrive at the Krater with your team of freelancers to take part in
the goldrush where people come back rich or dont come back at all.
