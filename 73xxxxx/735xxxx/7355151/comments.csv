Also, the high resolution artwork that I included in the folder is already embedded into each track. You need only to download and drag into iTunes before you listen."

,Lallapalalable,2012-09-08T08:41Z,"I noticed the songs tend to either take a while to play on my mp3 player, or if I put them on a disc they'll all have about 45 seconds of silence at the end.  Anyone else have this problem?  Or does WMP just suck that badly?"
,NCC86,2012-09-11T06:21Z,"@Lallapalalable: WMP just sucks that badly. I use iTunes with these exact same identical audio files and they work splendidly. Also, if you're having that much silence between tracks on a CD, you may want to check your burn settings. Some CD burning software offers the option to set the amount of silence you want between tracks or to even create a gapless album. If you want no silence between the tracks then gapless album is what you want to choose. Try that and let me know if it works for you."
