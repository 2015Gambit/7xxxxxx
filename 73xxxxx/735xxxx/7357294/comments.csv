,bhphotos,2012-06-16T03:52Z,"Why am I only seeing total play of 54 minutes if it's ""Full Match""?"
,Ezel,2012-06-16T04:26Z,"It might just be my setup, but I get a LOT of crackling sounds on both my TV and on my computer-system. :-/"
,shabbamanuk,2012-06-16T04:46Z,bad bad sound
,bhphotos,2012-06-16T05:00Z,It's not your setup... the audio is shit.
,shweetboet,2012-06-16T06:55Z,the video is not great either
,Outl4w3d,2012-06-16T07:04Z,"Here is how to make the audio a little more bearable: 

Right click on VLC's screen.
Go to Audio -> Audio Device
Change it no Mono.

There is still some crackling but its much better than before."
