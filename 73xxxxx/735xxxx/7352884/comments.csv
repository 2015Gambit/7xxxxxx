Great to see you back - with a brand new computer. We were a lot of upcoming french immigrants hoping to learn some dirty french words before leaving the shit we are living in.

Please reupload the french levels. 

Great torrents -THX!"

,comski,2012-09-01T16:33Z,"same here chill..When I double click the .iso files they open to a window with four folders data, documentation, languages and speech.
FOR MAC:
Double click all language iso files (to open with DiskImageMounter), then go open Rosetta Stone, and at the top-right, one of the drop down menus will give you the option to ""Add or Remove Languages"". Click that and proceed through the steps.
