First, this same user uploaded a file a few days ago that was a 3 minute promo for Burn Notice that is freely available all over the internet.  The uploader called the file a ""pre-episode"". Why go to such trouble to hide the fact that it's just a promo?

Then that ""pre-episode"" was 100 MB in size--a ridiculously large size for a 3 minute video.

Now this file has problems, too.  The title of this download seems to suggest the title of this episode is ""compulsion"".  I follow Burn Notice stuff obsessively, and I'm pretty sure the first episode is called ""Scorched Earth"".  

Also, I've downloaded A LOT of Burn Notice episodes and they are either about 350 MB or 700 MB (if high definition, I think).  Why is this download 1.15 GB?!? 

I am by no means a guru of computers or torrent downloads, so if I am missing some information and my suspicions are wrong, I am deeply sorry. But I know there are some people who will take advantage of this site to get people to download malicious stuff."

,TheKhaos24,2012-06-15T06:09Z,"@R9k6wh0naIK 
Compulsion, is actually the name of the group that uploaded this haha. It comes from PublicHD which is a real group...so I'm gonna say it's real. Gonna go ahead and download this though, because of the file size. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7355144/Burn_Notice_S06E01_HDTV_XviD-AFG%5Bettv%5D"
,tpbtemp00,2012-06-15T06:23Z,"I understand your worry over the legitimacy of it being the episode or not but standard avi quality uploads are around 700MB, but HD uploads are ALWAYS 1.13-1.16GB in MKV. So yes, this proves the quality being at 42minutes without commercials. Now whether this is the episode or not... can somebody confirm? Thanks. BURN NOTICE !!!!"
,tpbtemp00,2012-06-15T06:25Z,"One more thing... yes 350MB too are the usual quick ones. I have them all in HD 1.15GB, except for Season 1 because it was originally broadcasted in 4:3 SD. 1.15 is the standard."
,LazarusL,2012-06-15T06:30Z,"I believe your fears are groundless. This poster has posted literally hundreds of torrents here, for a long time now: click on his name above for the complete list. The overwhelming majority have titles that end in either ""…720p HDTV x264 IMMERSE,"" or ""…720p HDTV x264 DIMENSION,"" or (as in this case) ""…720p HDTV x264 COMPULSION"".  Whatever those mean, they are clearly not meant as episode titles. And his torrents are nearly all as large in size as this one.  I say let's assume his good will."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-06-15T06:48Z,"@R9k6wh0naIK:

Okay, here are your answers. The previous episode was uploaded because it was in High Definition. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video )

COMPULSION is the name of the Scene group that released this episode. Its not the name of show, please read more about what the scene is before complaining."
,R9k6wh0naIK,2012-06-15T14:00Z,"Thanks for all the information and setting me straight.  I apologize, DibyaTPB, I didn't mean to trash you unfairly.

I've been educated here, as, I'm sure others will be, too.

Thank you for the upload!

A note, though: it does help a lot to have a more detailed description."
,LazarusL,2012-06-15T19:19Z,"…and by the way, DibyaTPB, congratulations on being the first to post this episode, wanted so badly by so many.  Fast work!  Thanks."
