,cawoodie,2012-06-14T07:02Z,Are you in the second grade lad? What freaking language please...
,cawoodie,2012-06-14T07:06Z,"Wait, I want to apologize to all the second graders out there, including my 6 year old daughter who will be going into the second grade. I truly believe even they would not have made this mistake."
,oshava,2012-06-14T17:22Z,@cawoodie maybe you should think before you insult ever think they might have posted the actual core program and not just a language pack?
,cawoodie,2012-06-14T23:06Z,"@oshava, ah, what a humanitarian. I'm in tears. To help an underdog is such a noble feat."
,Niree1978,2012-06-15T06:56Z,"I've been looking for this app. I already have the language packs I wanted so I hope this works. :-) Looks like some people should SHUT UP and get some manners. Come on down to the southern U.S., we'll teach you a thing or two."
,Niree1978,2012-06-15T08:05Z,Works great! Thanks!
,Av7x,2012-06-15T14:25Z,"Thanks.

,alexcinderpelt,2012-06-21T03:43Z,@samsum you copy the crack and paste and replace it with the .exe thats already there and to add a language open the program and click add a language level and i guess pick the language file you want to add

,l2ocket,2012-06-22T23:57Z,"Could someone please explain to me how to do the whole crack thing?? I've searched everywhere online and I can't find any info. I'm a total newb to this kind of thing, but I can't do a language past level 2 without ""activation"" apparently. I've uninstalled the program...waiting to reinstall when someone can help. Thanks!!"
,superconfused,2012-06-23T01:06Z,"never mind, figured it out"
,kices,2012-06-25T00:05Z,"cmon man, this guy was nice enough to upload the program.  he isnt responsible for training you how to not be a moron too.  google it"
,Razze_95,2012-06-27T23:02Z,"Not sure if this is newly occurring issue, but each time I attempt to launch this program I get an ""application error"". 
It worked perfectly just a few months ago, so I'm wondering if it might be a hot fix or so, to stop cracked versions."
,XXORKOXX,2012-07-04T23:00Z,"Hey, dont forget, this is the Rosetta software only. you need to download the language packs Separate. Oh and  in oder to make la langueges work you must have or download ""daemon tools lite"" wich works as a virtual CD drive and simulates as if you had the actual CD in your computer without using the REal Rosetta CD's."

,marillita23,2012-07-07T06:55Z,"Hello dear people,

I'm not great with computers, and this may sound stupid to some of you, but I have no clue on how to install this and I need some help. As soon as I unzip the package I don't see a .exe file to install the program or anything similar. What am I supposed to do?

Thanks!"
,hogan126,2012-07-11T13:46Z,"Hey guys, doing a second scan now but just thought you should know my avast found 2 viruses in the data folders, no where else on my laptop, may be a bad crack"
,caylaaahammm,2012-07-18T05:58Z,"Is there an activation key I need to use? After level one lesson 3, it won't let me go on without an activation key."
,m41389,2012-07-23T21:29Z,"does anyone have a problem where when you open the program all you see is a blank grey screen with no options? I've already installed my language pack, but can't use it. any fixes?"
,joethetoe,2012-07-25T16:53Z,"Ok can anyone help me. Ive installed this, copy an pasted the crack, burned the launguage I want to a cd. But the program wont find the CD? Im stumped."
,f3nr1l,2012-08-10T03:41Z,"So I installed and cracked it, but for some reason every time I try to run the program it says:
""2123
There was an error in the application."" 

What am I doing wrong? I've tried compatibility mode and running as admin, so I'm really stumped. "
