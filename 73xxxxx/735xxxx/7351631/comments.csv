,melvinngu,2012-06-30T02:11Z,"how to fix garena error? ""this version does not support loader"""
,EnGuardian,2012-06-30T14:36Z,"Load in Garena SystemKillingFloor.exe, not RUN_KF.exe. Or if you got problems with Perks and/or Steam, delete KillingFloor.ini and rename RUN_KF.exe to KillingFloor.exe and load it into Garena."
,EnGuardian,2012-06-30T14:37Z,"System folder, file KillingFloor.exe.*
System/KillingFloor.exe"
,Xes69,2012-07-01T15:26Z,"To change language open rev.ini:
Language=Russian
change it to:
Language=Int
*****
To reset perks - delete stats.bin

You could play the game directly, without Tunngle/Hamachi/Garena, etc. Just search for cracked servers and put it to favorites tab.

,Drunksorrow,2012-07-27T07:42Z,"Anyone complaining about multiplayer taking to long to load, I have a solution. Make sure you have the latest update (103.7), make sure you enter a game that matches your update. And the ones that take long to load is a custom map, just sit through if u want to play, i minimize Killer floor and look at porn while i wait, you will figure it out."
