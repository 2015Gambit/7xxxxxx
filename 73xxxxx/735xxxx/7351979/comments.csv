,k1774b,2012-06-14T01:55Z,"One Thank You so far?

That's some bullshit. 

As an American, without cable, who works 9-5pm (Most euro games here broadcast at 8am or 1pm typically) I would like to offer smokkedog a HUGE THANK YOU!

I really appreciate the time and effort (and risk) that goes into each upload.

I definitely know what you mean about loosing your cable. It is getting too expensive and now all sports are being shown on cable.

Hey what's up @shabbamanuk my home town boy. "

Awesome uplaod. 

The full show! At last someone uploads the full shabang.

Any chance of uploading Italy vs England full BBC show as one file? This stops us from seeing that there was/wasn't extra time so it stops a slight spoiler.

Thanks for the upload. The best one I've seen so far."
