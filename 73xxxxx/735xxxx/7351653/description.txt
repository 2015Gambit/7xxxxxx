Information
------------------------------

Alcatraz... Devil's Island... Botany Bay: these prisons, among the most feared on Earth, give a whole new meaning to the term "hard time." They didn't merely cage societiety's worst, they shattered their spirits. Many cracked under the torment, but some fought desperately to survive - even escape. This is the closest you'll get - or would want to! - to these notorious lockups.


Part 2 : Devil's Island

It was a place so severe, it broke even the toughest convict. This tiny penal colony on the edge of the Amazon rainforest was literally a "Hell on Earth" from which there was no escape (although many tried). The punishments were notorious for their horrifying severity. The conditions were so inhumane that many inmates would rather risk death by trying to flee. Descend into the depths of this dark place to relive twisted tales of prison life and desperate attempts at freedom that reveal the lndomitable will of the human spirit. Narrated by Stacy Keach. approx. 50 mlns, col.
