Before you throw away, sell or donate your PC you should keep this in mind:

People with bad intentions will pick up your PC off the road.
People with bad intentions will search the local thrift for donated PCΓÇÖs.
What are these ΓÇ£bad intentionsΓÇ¥ and why should you care?

Almost every single file you delete on your PC can easily be recovered; deleting files isnΓÇÖt removing them forever! Disk Format doesnΓÇÖt remove data either! All kinds of data is on your PC, even if you delete it! Things like:

Passwords saved in Internet Explore or Firefox.
Cookies from sites youΓÇÖve visited that will allow anyone that picks up your PC to be able to use it as if theyΓÇÖre you, checking your email etc.
Files with personal information like tax returns, password list, family photos etc.
Now I hope you understand that just selling or donating your PC without properly preparing it is a bad mistake. Your PC sitting on the site of the road is a target for people with bad intentions.
