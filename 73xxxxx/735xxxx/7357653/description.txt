Rare is the folk album that is comfortable referencing the Neighbours theme tune alongside obscure Victorian parlour music. But, then, Fay Hield is a rare folk singer. Embracing both the intellectualism of the dusty library and the spilt-beer abandon of folk clubs, Hield interprets 11 traditional songs on Orfeo with nuance and verve.
Her debut album, 2010ΓÇÖs Looking Glass, was technically accomplished but unadventurous. By comparison, Orfeo is a huge leap forward in confidence and vision. HieldΓÇÖs day job as an ethnomusicologist gives her the chops to tackle difficult and obscure material; but OrfeoΓÇÖs success lies in partnering this scholarship with gut feeling.
From the eerie rumble of opener The LoverΓÇÖs Ghost through to the concluding warped nursery rhyme Naughty Baby, Orfeo is admirably diverse. Desolate songs of chance encounters rub against bawdy vaudevillian leg-flashing. Few singers could pull off the complicated medieval ballad Sir Orfeo, and then immediately follow it with the feisty Yorkshire stoicism of The Old ΓÇÿArris Mill. Hield does so and, moreover, makes them natural bedfellows. Her exceptional band The Hurricane Party ΓÇô featuring Bellowhead members Jon Boden and Sam Sweeney, alongside Martin Simpson, Andy Cutting and Rob Harbron ΓÇô is equally flexible and vibrant.
Unusually for a modern folk revivalist, Hield largely resists highly emotional vocals. ItΓÇÖs what she doesnΓÇÖt do with the song thatΓÇÖs important, too. For instance, on The Cuckoo, a song of fickle affection made famous by Anne Briggs, Hield never cracks into misery. Instead, she builds up the narratorΓÇÖs self-defence, and this ultimately gives the song greater power. This also works well on the subtle The WeaverΓÇÖs Daughter, pregnant with all the rural tragedy of a Thomas Hardy novel. Most striking of all is the murder ballad Henry. As it moves towards its conclusion, the murmuring drone behind Hield builds to an ominous buzz, before retreating to a whisper, in horror at the final lyrical reveal.
On Orfeo, Fay Hield is a purist in the best sense of the word. She doesnΓÇÖt seek to graft herself onto these songs; instead, and with considerable skill, she draws out new layers of wit, tenderness and melancholia from them.
