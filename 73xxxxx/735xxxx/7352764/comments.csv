,1Atheist,2012-06-21T04:20Z,"Can this be played on my PS3? I already downloaded this from Apple, but it doesn't play on my PS3! The March Special event DOES play on it, but there's something different about THIS one, it seems. I've tried to convert it from .m4v to .mp4 with TWO different programs and BOTH froze up at exactly the same point ('54% converted' mark)!! I've read Online that it may have DRM in it which prevents it from being played on a non-iDevice or being converted! Is that true? Please help me out, someone! :-/"
