,jacer1212,2012-06-17T10:48Z,i just clicked this and it worked for me.   what's bugging me is that 888.com popup window that keeps showing up.  not sure what's making it open.
[V],psspss,2012-06-17T12:20Z,"no directlinks are working.. magnet work though

try a recent upload and your see want i mean
others have commented on it on other torrents

also your see crawlers of tpb like kat ph
are adding the 4gb mkv for this show :)"
[T],trialNerror,2012-06-17T13:05Z,"why are you people still using torrent links?
those are prone to be screwed up.
magnets have been 100% accurate.

@jacer - which browser are you using? does it support security addons such as adblock, ghost, and noscript? if you're not using those, that's probably why you have popups (and flashy ads all over the page, too?). all that crap can easily go away with adblock and ghost or noscript.

@psspss - wtf you goin on about 4gb mkv files of this show? there's only 1gb files of Celeb Ghost Stories. hell, even the full episode's RAW .ts file directly from the hd box is well under 3gb. i think that includes commercials, too.  so, yeah, people, do NOT EVER listen to psspss."
[V],psspss,2012-06-18T13:01Z,"tne... keep taking the drugs

the same torrent download for any uploads here
for a few hours.. it was a 4.6gb movie called titans
others have commented on it.. I guess no one else here foudn the problem as they went with magnet links instead

in fact the directlinking is still down.. keeps
saying reset connection i guess TPB mods dont work in weekends else it would of been fixed by now"
