Understand, this is a cam copy.  The audio is fair at best (echos at times).  The video is good at best.  No head shots or cam shakes.  Best cam copy I've seen, yet.   Thanks uploader!     "

I would give it a V7 arguably for cam, A2, cause it sounds like shit...really. I wouldn't DL, cause you wont like the sound at all."
