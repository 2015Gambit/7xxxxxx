,KevvzHDD,2012-06-17T18:41Z,Downloading. I will comment if this is legit or not later :D
,hxcj88,2012-06-18T02:59Z,Audio for sure not a 10 but you can't complain with this leaking a month early.
,Alissaaa,2012-06-18T06:36Z,YES. Thank you. 
,KevvzHDD,2012-06-18T14:36Z,It's legit! :) Thanks DropDeadChico!
,redsnow86,2012-06-22T20:47Z,What's the quality is it 320??
,questless,2012-06-26T03:06Z,beast mad props bro thanks
,somechink,2012-06-26T03:17Z,"If you weren't a fan of Selfish Machines and like the old PTV like me, Bulls in the Bronx and The First Punch will probably be the only tracks that interest you."
,SHWAG,2012-06-26T19:55Z,"All tracks are great quality, EXCEPT, 4. ""King For A Day"""
,lirki,2012-06-27T15:17Z,Is it just my torrent messing up or are tracks 1 and 2 a bit weird on the swap?
,UploaderDownloads,2012-07-08T22:46Z,"To fix the gap between track 1 and 2, make track two start at 00:01.5. To do this in iTunes right click track 2 and go to get info, then click the options tab and enter 00:01.5 into the 'start time' box. "
,DropDeadChico,2012-07-17T03:57Z,"Thanks so much for the feedback guys. Sorry the quality isnt top notch but its not that bad, its good for being leaked as early as it did. 300 seeders is ridiculous! Sorry for the shit description as well. :("
,PREDATOR95X,2012-09-04T05:09Z,Thanks
