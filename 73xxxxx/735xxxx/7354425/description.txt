
AntiDupl.NET is a small and easy to use application that will help you find and delete your duplicate images. It can find and display duplicate images in the main graphic formats: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, EMF, WMF, EXIF and ICON. The comparison is based on the contents of the files, so the program can find not only almost identical, but similar images. In addition, the program can find images with some types of defects.
