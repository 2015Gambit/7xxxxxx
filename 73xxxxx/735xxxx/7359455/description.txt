     From the engine roar and fever pitch of professional stock car racing, 
     Days of Thunder explodes with the most spectacular racing action ever
     captured on film. 

     Tom Cruise plays race driver Cole Trickle, whose talent and ambition are
     surpassed only by his burning need to win. Discovered by businessman Tim
     Daland (Randy Quaid), Cole is teamed with legendary crew chief and
     car-builder Harry Hogge (Academy Award. winner Robert Duvall) to race
     for the Winston Cup at the Daytona 500. A fiery crash nearly ends Cole's
     career and he must turn to a beautiful doctor (Nicole Kidman) to regain
     his nerve and the true courage needed to race, to win and to live.
