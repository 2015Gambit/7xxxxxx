Robag's trademark is his excessive use of reverb effects. Like black holes they suck in and spit out the most varied influences. It's a kind of magic. "WUPPDECKMISCHMAMPFLOW" is Robag Wruhme's latest mix CD and could be considered as an immaculte conception. It was crafted incidentally between feeding the pig and unscrewing gherkin glasses, so to say. Far away from the hectic turmoil of clubs and airports, he began toying around with his favourite tracks and songs. It turned out as a very intimate, wonderful piece of music that Robag needed to share with us. It's boom time for the bespoke reverb effects. He gingerly interweaves music by Moderat, Four Tet, Ricardo Villalobos, Whomadewho, Danny Norbury, Trentem√∂ller and Tiefschwarz into a greater ONE. "WUPPDECKMISCHMAMPFLOW" became an honest, touching, life-enhancing affair. The perfect co-driver, room mate, old sport, dear abby and pocket hand warmer.
