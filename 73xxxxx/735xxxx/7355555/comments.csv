""TLA's pre contains audio encoded with the AAC-LTP instead of the AAC-LC
profile which as per SD.x264 rules is invalid

Also used constant biterate inplace of VBR""

As a result this file by TLA doesn't have audio reproduced by some video players.  Althought it will play in MediaClassic and VLC players

I am unaware of TLA making these same mistakes on other TLA post.  If your video player won't play this file of Conan's show I suggest you DL 2HD's file of this same show"
