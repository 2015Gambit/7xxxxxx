The Long Distance Runners have been building a reputation as being one of NewfoundlandΓÇÖs hardest working up-in-coming bands; for the past two years the band has toured extensively, developing their sound on the road and their 2010 self-titled EP garnered some ECMA/Music NL award nominations. Tracks is an easy-to-love collection of catchy songs that will have you playing ΓÇ£guess the influenceΓÇ¥ ΓÇô these songs are so good because they will remind you of other bands, well at first anyway.

Opening track ΓÇ£Election DayΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£KnucklesΓÇ¥ sound pulled right off of EelsΓÇÖ Daisies of the Galaxy. ΓÇ£Sally AnnΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£If I Forget To Say I Love YouΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Credits RollΓÇ¥ clearly have a Wilco slant that would not of sounded out-of-place on Being There. IΓÇÖm not saying these songs are bad in any way ΓÇô they are particularly fun and have some really loose arrangements that are always on point.

Now, to the part I love the most; after ΓÇ£Credits RollΓÇ¥ the band, to me, sounds different. ΓÇ£You DonΓÇÖt Answer AnymoreΓÇ¥ sounds uniquely Long Distance Runners. ΓÇ£Answer AnymoreΓÇ¥ blends perfectly into album highlight ΓÇ£The IslandΓÇ¥ where the originality continues with its time signature twists that keep you guessing. Instrumental track, ΓÇ£Up The RiverΓÇ¥ puts you into that auditory environment and is another nice transition into ΓÇ£He DoesnΓÇÖt Stare into The Sun No MoreΓÇ¥ a country-soul-pop number that is pure ear-candy. ΓÇ£A Short History of AmericaΓÇ¥ ends the record with a slowly building rock groove built on layers of organ and piano parts as the whole band comes together with soaring harmonies that drives the whole vibe of the record home.
