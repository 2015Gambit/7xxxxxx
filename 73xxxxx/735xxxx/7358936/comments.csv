,dahauk,2012-06-16T23:32Z,Primeval ended on series 5. There is no series 6. Other sites suggest this is repeat/repost of series 5 ep 1.

[T],helder1965,2012-06-17T02:57Z,"This is the first episode of season 5 indeed! Just now the open UK TV is airing this series! Last year it was seen only in cable TV! Anyway, this release was assigned as NUKED already: ""[NUKE FoV] [mislabeled.S05E01_dupe.AVCHD.2011-07-02]"""
,justiffi,2012-06-17T03:05Z,series didn't end at season 5 because they just started airing the new season (s5) today. did anyone actually check itv.com for info? can anyone confirm if this is real or fake.
,justiffi,2012-06-17T03:06Z,"Thanks  helder1965. 

ok. downloading now to confirm. "
[T],helder1965,2012-06-17T04:14Z,"Guys, unfortunately and very probably there won't be a 6th season. Only if a very large quantity of British viewers watch this rerun on open UK TV they will think to a new season. And this is very unlikely because after 1 year, everybody that wanted watch it already watched it, on cable TV, all complete seasons on DVD box or even on internet! It is sad but it is the truth! :-("
[T],helder1965,2012-06-17T04:46Z,"Guys, more details about this ""out of time"" 5th season, here: http://cultfix.co.uk/primeval-returns-to-itv1-in-june-17744.htm"
,dahauk,2012-06-17T05:45Z,"Series 5 had 6 episodes.
Andrew-Lee Potts is reprising his role as Connor in the Primeval spin-off, 'Primeval:New World'. Filming got underway 7 March 2012. Thirteen episodes were commissioned for the first series. 'Primeval: New World' will retain elements from the British series while introducing a new cast of Canadian characters, described it as ""a parallel yet independent series"". The tone of the series will be ""older, darker and scarier"" than the original. It will be broadcast in the United Kingdom on Watch, and on Space in Canada."
