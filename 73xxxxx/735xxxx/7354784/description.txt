Affecting 4 percent of children and 1-2 percent of the general population, epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. The 1st edition of this guide proved to be the only one of its kind, covering many important aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Due to the continued advances being made in the subject, and building on the sell-out success of the 1st edition this thorough revision reflects the latest report of the ILAE classification core group and the significant progress made in the diagnosis, classification and treatment of the epilepsies.
