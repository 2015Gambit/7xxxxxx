  Bazaar is a 1982 Indian film directed       
  by Sagar Sarhadi and starring Naseeruddin   
  Shah, Farooq Shaikh, Smita Patil and        
  Supriya Pathak.The film highlights the      
  tragedy of young girls being sold by        
  needy parents to affluent Indians in        
  the Gulf. The film has sterling performances
  from almost all the cast and is akin to     
  some other movies in the 1980s which        
  highlighted oppression by the rich and      
  powerful. Bazaar ('marketplace')is a        
  realistic portrayal and highlights a        
   system which is difficult to change.
