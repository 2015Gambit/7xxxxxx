i got this same release with a keygen from 'ErES' exactly 6 months ago
and there hasn't been a final(non beta) update since

Not complaining about this but i quit using it and went with direct show..
I was using it with shark007's codec pack on x64 win7
the trick is to disable certain things in the swap time and maybe run Direct show filter tweaker

I've also set this up in winamp before
just google 3rd party directshow + winamp.. its pretty easy to setup"
,xpmule,2012-06-15T00:15Z,"meant to say
i went with FFDSHOW instead
and swap 'TAB'
not swap 'time'

LOL uggh i'm so bad at this whole typing keyboard thing :("
