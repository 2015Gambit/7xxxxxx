,whtvr2,2012-06-15T10:47Z,"grandfred29, do it properly than. How can anyone supposed to find it if you don't add FSX in the title, you didn't even get the tags right. 
I would have gotten it from you if it was possible to find it. ;)"
,grandfred29,2012-06-15T13:15Z,"Yes i know, i tried to modify the title but i don't find how to do it. 

I'll pay more intention the next time i'll upload a nex new torrent."
,whtvr2,2012-06-15T15:26Z,"grandfred29, just reupload it like I did. Or go the forums and request deletion of torrent."
,_SnakEye,2012-06-15T19:14Z,"grandfred29 and whtvr2, thank you both for the effort of U/L this torrent, even though they are essentially the same.
we all do mistakes the 1st time, so did I.
but we learn and improve from our mistakes.
and it's good to have here members here that accept critique and not flame each other over it.."
