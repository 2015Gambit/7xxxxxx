,Woodah123,2012-06-17T01:03Z,Is it supposed to help you play xbox360 games on the pc or vice versa?
,GoodGravy,2012-06-17T03:42Z,"Why not just use Xpadder?

,yahiko1992,2012-06-17T09:42Z,help u to play games like Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City on your pc with pc controller
,asdfkjjj,2012-06-17T11:44Z,"This is just x360ce,  which is a free download, just Google it.  The idea is that when you have a non-xbox or PS type USB controller in windows that doesn't work in-game properly you can use this utility to reconfigure the games use of the controller. This does take some time and patience setting up and it hasn't worked for every game although there are many online templates. I do not know why this is torrented here (and with so little info), the site has a manual and everything:
 code.google.com/p/x360ce/"
,asdfkjjj,2012-06-17T11:46Z,"FYI,  Xpadder is cool for older keyboard only games. It just translates key presses into controller commands. Good app too!"
,GoodGravy,2012-06-17T12:40Z,"@asdfkjjj, I don't know where you get your info from, I use xpadder on all the latest games including Max Payne 3, it doesn't just do keyboard, it does keyboard and mouse for all the newest games; this torrent is only for Xbox360, xpadder works with almost all controllers,...just FYI."
