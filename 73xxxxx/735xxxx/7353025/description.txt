Jimmy And The Giant Supermarket 
With food prices on the rise and consumers feeling the pinch, can shoppers still afford to care about where the food they put on the table every day comes from? Rare breed pig farmer Jimmy Doherty has a dream to make free range food affordable for everyone. So he's challenged Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, to let him prove he can do it, and they've agreed. Animal welfare standards might have come a long way in the UK, but most of the country's chickens are still reared intensively, 60% of pigs still spend their whole lives in sheds, and tens of thousands of dairy calves are needlessly slaughtered each year because it's too expensive to rear them. Jimmy's taking on three of Tesco's best-selling own brand products and will work with the company to try and make higher-welfare versions for the same affordable price. If he's successful, they'll launch them in their stores.




3)  Chicken Kiev 
Jimmy Doherty tries to make free range chicken Kievs for Tesco, but will Tesco's customer tasters like them? Jimmy also campaigns against the slaughter of thousands of male dairy calves. And he gears up for the launch day of his affordable free-range products, nervous to see if the public will buy them or not.
