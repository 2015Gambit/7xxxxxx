Mass is a melodic metal band from Boston that's been around since 1981. They released a couple of albums in the '80s, then resurfaced a few years ago. Their debut album was released in 1985, but it wasn't really their debut album. A few years prior, they were signed to a different label, and due to creative and legal issues, the album was shelved. Finally, almost 30 years later, Fighter is seeing the light of day. (Not to be confused with Metal Fighter, released by the German metal band also called Mass in 1983.) 
A few of the songs on Fighter would appear on New Birth, but even those songs sound different here. Mass plays classic '80s metal, with huge hooks and ample guitars. Vocalist Louis D'Augusta has a strong voice and a wide range. He generally sings in a middle range, but periodically will belt out a powerful high note.
