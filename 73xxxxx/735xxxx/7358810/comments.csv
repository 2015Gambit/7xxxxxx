,Nanijirobi,2012-06-17T16:42Z,"Same problem for over 24 hours, with several torrents."
,nobleguy,2012-06-18T04:46Z,Does anyone actually got this file that they can reseed it for us all?
,Hilpi75,2012-06-18T10:46Z,none of TVTeam or Scenebalance Uploads work.  Problem has been for about three days now but they keep uploading??  Damn it  :(
,TsarB0mba,2012-06-23T07:36Z,"Other TvTeam uploads are working fine. This one reports >30 seeds in my torrent client but none of of the seeds are accepting connections.  I don't know if this means TvTeam pulled the seed too early or what, but it's not the fault of the upload itself."
