,link5a,2012-09-02T03:32Z,"Thanks for all the 3 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies, IceBane! I'd be really awesome if you could do, at some point, the new animated one: TMNT (2007) in order to complete the Blu-Ray film collection: http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Film-Collection-Blu-ray/4096/
Only you can make this happen! Thanks again!"
