However you do a poor job of actually describing the fucking thing. I am here to find out more. You fucking idiot."
,opaleg,2012-06-14T23:16Z,"And how in fucking HELL does the name speak for itself!!!! It's in fucking japanese with a fucked up english 'A.K.A'

Are you high? The description is SHIT!!"

which I guess means ""super deformed characters enact every 'trick' in the kama sutra"""
