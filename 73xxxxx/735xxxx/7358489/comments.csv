Lets hope the SciFI Horror Hollywood is making isnt a fook up

b-grade thing.. The producer is over in Russia now research and production I believe starts in Apr-July

yep.. totally freaky story.. 

since some didnt watch ancient aliens as most of its rubbish
this is one segment worth keeping seperate with other material ont he subject

Some more is mentioned in the UFOS over Russia in the MUFON
UFO Collection I upped.. well worht watching that one
one of the 12-14 presentations thats worthy of watching out the
66 in the collection.. sadly all end as they getting more interesting

perhaps someone will buy the dvds of the better stories"
[V],psspss,2012-06-17T03:19Z,"So possible theories to what happened? lets start a discussion :D

1) An Mountain Man axe murderer was following them and
attacked in the middle of the night 

2) Russia Troops on a battle exercise played with them

3) A group of Bigfoots attacked them

4( A UFO fooked with them

5) They interacted with the UFO and Russian troops
showed up and beat them up to say nothing.. 
and then decide just to kill them by letting them freeze
while on the run from them?

6) The Demon spirits of the mountain attacked them

7) The ghosts of the other 9 Indian People who also died in
a similar way appeared to them at 3am
and scared the fook out of them and they took off to the woods
but then who beat some of them up 

mean while no evidence of anything other then the campers
was in the area.. very odd indeed
