More Info-

The story sounds like something out of a low-budget horror movie: nine young students go on a skiing holiday in RussiaΓÇÖs Ural Mountains but never return. Eventually, their bodies are discovered ΓÇô five of them frozen to death near their tent, four more bearing mysterious injuries ΓÇô a smashed head, a missing tongue ΓÇô buried in the snow some distance away. All, it seems, had fled in sudden terror from their camp in the middle of the night. Casting aside skis, food and warm coats, they dashed headlong down a snowy slope toward a thick forest, where they stood no chance of surviving bitter temperatures of around ΓÇô30┬║ C (ΓÇô22┬║ F). At the time, seemingly baffled investigators offered the non-explanation that the group had died as a result of ΓÇ£a compelling unknown forceΓÇ¥ ΓÇô and then simply closed the case and filed it as ΓÇÿTop SecretΓÇÖ.
