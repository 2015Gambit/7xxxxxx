,JamesIGTM,2012-06-16T03:00Z,"Hi Guys,

My name is James Swirsky - Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m one of the two people who made Indie Game: The Movie. Myself and Lisanne Pajot spent our last two years working on this film. We kept a pretty active blog about the production of the film on our site (www.indiegamethemovie.com).

We are a two person team, making this film completely independently. And we want to keep on making films for your enjoyment.

If you like the movie, consider purchasing it over on iTunes, Steam or completely DRM-Free (in a variety of encodes) directly from us over at www.IndieGameTheMovie.com. You can also get a copy to gift to a friend if youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;d like to.

Thanks for taking an interest in our film.

-James Swirsky
Co-director/Maker of Indie Game: The Movie"
,anonyboy,2012-06-20T02:05Z,Sorry James Swirsky but I'd rather have it for free.
,anonyboy,2012-06-20T07:17Z,After watching this I have only really learned 1 thing: Indie developers are very depressed frustrated neurotic obsessive compulsive people that derive joy only from 100% praise and take every bug and flaw in their work as a deep personal failure that may or may not be worth killing themselves over.
,Windheart,2012-06-20T23:32Z,Anyone who is interested in indie games knows that support is really important to indie developers. Financial support also. This film is worth buying even if you've already downloaded it.
,blackiwid,2012-06-28T16:12Z,"@anonyboy, you could say that in a less confrontatic tone, but maybe it was not your intention.

I am happy that some people make such offers, and even talk to ""pirates"" and not calling them thiefs and stuff... but to ask for support.

I also think that this torrent here will generate some income for the makers... and thats good... I will tell other people I know which are willing to spend money to some stuff.

I am unemployed and I dont get enough money for buying such stuff also for such high prices.

I would suggest you would change in your next movies to a model with a more dynamic pay-modell... there where some projects that did go the ""pay what you want"" role and in the middle the people payed also around 10 dollars. so It would not be a problem, but I think then even more people would buy it or pay... or other said, maybe double the amount of people download it, on half pays nothing the other half in the middle 20 dollars. thats what happend in the other projekts. even a indigame bundle gives you here a good example... google humble bundle... that was a big sucess.

but that aside your offer and your peaceful comment here are way better than what he see on other sides and it pays for it, several news sites talk about it and many users pay for it, and again even the ""pirates"" make advertisment for it."

,vibroaxe,2012-07-05T22:29Z,"Anonyboy is a dick. People like you are the reason big media still makes money, because you're discouraging support for small developers and filmmakers. 
We need to support Swirsky and others, or industry norms and money-making will be what gets movies produced rather than inspiration, imagination, innovation. What Swirsky did here is nothing short of amazing. Don't screw him over because you don't like his piece of work. 
However, I will be torrenting this film until I have the money to buy a copy. I support torrenting because we deserve access to all information and all media, no matter what our income level. I will be donating after because that is the future of art, music, film, literature, videogames. Demanding money for information is censorship. Asking for the money is humble and admirable. 
And Indie Games- That's the shit I live for. I support this film. I support independent game development. I support torrenting. I support donating to someone who has created something beautiful. I do not support Anonyboy."
,Knez1950,2012-07-12T23:55Z,uploaded full movie + subs on YouTube (just search ThePostalDude1950)
,lfarah,2012-07-16T05:57Z,"@JamesIGTM I've already rent the movie on iTunes, and I am waiting for the blu-ray version. This movie is so fucking awesome and I wanna be a developer!  I'm downloading here just because I don't wanna wait until the blu-ray launch"
,cactusX,2012-08-08T06:44Z,"anonboy you're a bit of a jerk... really.


James did the right thing in encouraging people that liked this to buy it from them directly through their website.... which I find to be fantastic. I also agree with Blackiwid in that they should try the 'pay what you want' model for their future efforts.

Humble bundle did insanely well... and I feel this model would work really well for you too."
