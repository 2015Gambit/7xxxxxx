Dressed in Persian clothes, chased by hooligans
famous Indian-born Rockstar, Jordan, barely    
makes it to a Czech stadium to perform before  
a huge crowd. It was not too long ago that he  
was just an awkward uninhibited collegian      
wanna-be musician with a name of Janardhan     
Jakhar, who was ridiculed everywhere. His      
family wanted him to be inducted in their      
business but he refuses. He is counseled that  
music comes after experiencing pain, so he     
decides to woo Heer Kaul, the hottest girl     
on the college's 'Chicklist' in order to be    
rejected by her and thus experience pain.      
Initially he does face rejection from the      
sophisticated and cultured Heer, but quite     
surprisingly they subsequently become close    
friends, and he finds that underneath the stiff
upper lip, there is a woman who is full of life
