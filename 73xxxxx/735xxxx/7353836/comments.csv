Some calling him fraud and scammer too claiming the images are processing errors or what not..

but if just one of the thing brought to ones attendtion cant be debunked then we are lucky we got to hear about it to make up our own minds on it.

I have to wonder about these airbrush parts.
I know someone in  nasa in disclosure came out saying they did air brush out structures and ufos
so are the photos processing errors or
done on purpose we wont know until
someone aims hubble at the moon and does a high defn

but then whos to say the buildings and craft are mobile and have moved from those locations..
it never end.. will it..

and how about the dark side of the moon :)

and critters in space.. thats another story.. ice particles or space junk.. moving at right angels at hugh speed.. NAH"
[V],psspss,2012-06-15T07:24Z,"also worth a watch the presentation he did at mufon
premier of moon rising

but also shows rods 14000 feet up which cant be birds or insects.

he also made a statement about history chan debunk and that he didnt use the camera settings they claiming to cause the rod effect

[V],psspss,2012-06-15T09:23Z,"I have to agree with this crater ..however I see the
crater shadow is much bigger that the larger crater which is odd
but the white spill pattern on sides matches as a sligth side impact.. . but if you inverted the colors sure it would look like a disc over moon and not crater.. I think Jose should of shown
original photo then the color ones next to each other else it clearly shows some trickery on his
part there.

however not seen evidence explaining away the
airbrushed parts which are clearly triangles and squares and tall object towers castign shadows.. now they might be legit!?

[V],psspss,2012-06-15T09:35Z,"i think its misleading not showing the moon photo orig before showing his colored ones

the problem I see is the shadows if colored will change the appearance,, since normal
black and shadow blacks would get same color"
