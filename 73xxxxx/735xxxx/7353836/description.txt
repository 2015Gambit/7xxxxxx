Some Info on Moon RIsing (aka Greatest Story ever denied Part II)

In 2009, Jose Escamilla produced ΓÇ£Moon Rising,ΓÇ¥ a 73-minute documentary based on his work colorizing 274 photos of the moon. As well, his movie exposes the epic cover-up of what the Moon is, what is up there, what is looks like, and so much more. We thought it was time to revisit this important film that exposes ΓÇ£the greatest story ever denied.ΓÇ¥

Here is the official description of Moon Rising:

ΓÇ£On February 25,1994 1.8 million photos were taken of the Moon during the Clementine Mission. Different variations were taken including ΓÇ£Full ColorΓÇ¥ photos. . . . This is the first time in human history the Moon is being revealed to you in itsΓÇÖ ΓÇ£Full Natural Color.ΓÇ¥


ΓÇ£On the matter concerning whether or not we went to the Moon, we landed there without a doubt. This film is about what was waiting for us when we got there and the lies put in motion in order to conceal what was found. Moon researchers and investigators appearing in this film disclose facts hidden from you for over forty years. The facts will amaze and shock you at the same time. You may ask yourself why these lies have been impressed upon us all these year
