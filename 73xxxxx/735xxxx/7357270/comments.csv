,faanvet,2012-06-18T15:10Z,"that someone should open their seed is as usal to ask to much of all the retards downloading from TPB I reckon......

You just have to understand the thought of P2P....give as much as you ""take"". 
very simple and everybody gets happy....

Pople love when its free, but they are to greedy to share......"
,mkdhdh,2012-06-18T15:25Z,@shirepirate thx dude this made my day :D now i have a lego game to play after studying :D god i'm in search for a life
,mkdhdh,2012-06-18T21:07Z,"works perfectly smooth! even on a pal wii wich is weird that it didnt give me an error like cod did + THIS GAME IS FREAKING  AMAZING!!!!! EVERYONE MUST PLAY THIS i mean the free roam is mehh but i didnt play this for the free roam its just a nice addition like having hogwarts in lego HP. but stealing random cars is so much fun!!! it is always nighttime though thats what bugs me but turn your brightness up a notch and it looks like its dawn :D

wat a rant but hey this game is amazing! and i didnt even get to play as anyone else then batman and robin yet so i'm gonna enjoy this over the summer :D

thx for the upload"

,faanvet,2012-06-20T00:37Z,"2.4 kb/s....
Could someone please change their seeding parameters to give away more than 1 kb/s...

Noone seems to know the full meaning of torrentsites.. Its about sharing !!!!!
Not ""hit'n'run"" as seems to be default by all underdeveloped tenegers without a real life here !

Fucking twats !!!!!"
,Swedreamz,2012-06-21T08:34Z,"Need this, BUT the PAL-version. Does anyone know where I can find it?"
[V],totomas1,2012-07-01T09:28Z,No problems with the seeding. Took me less than five minutes to get this. Many thanks to everybody who seeds and specially to HobbitGamez for uploading this.
,iamchrislechat,2012-07-13T08:58Z,use a program called wiu (probably 1.1) to convert to pal/ntsc and remove updates
,nazgull2k10,2012-08-02T19:06Z,note - this is WBFS format.. worthless to those with WBFS Manager to Hard Drive formats.
[H],shirepirate,2012-08-04T09:20Z,"@nazgull2k10

you mean like it says in the title and description? Well IMAGINE that :D

,p00nh0und,2012-08-27T05:21Z,"This may sound stupid but is there a program 
i can use for winxp that will scrub down my existing iso's (which take up a ton of space) into wbfs format? I've been googling around and can't get a solid answer. I keep all my games on my HDD and then transfer them to flash drives when I want to play them. (can't afford a dedicated external for the wii right now.) It just seems like there should be a program where I drag and drop in an iso and it spits out a scrubbed wbfs file. I could then get rid of the iso and hold on to the smaller wbfs'. Any help is appreciated."
[H],shirepirate,2012-08-28T02:28Z,"@p00nh0und

Wii Game Manager does this
