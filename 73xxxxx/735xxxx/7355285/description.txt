This is the debut album of my pseudo band, The Uncredibles. I'm giving this album away for free for a few different reasons...

1. CD sales are no longer the primary source of income for most artist.
2. Exposure is more important.
3. I'm not innocent, nor a hypocrite.

The track listing is as follows....

1. Fuck Bono (4:29)
2. This Town (3:56)
3. Ditto Ditto (3:20)
4. Settle Then Justify (3:53)
5. All This WaitinΓÇÖ (6:55)
6. Listen to the Radio (4:31)
7. Security on the Rocks (5:08)
8. How to Use (3:14)
9. Underground (4:07)
10. Summer Days (4:10)
11. I Wanna Go Home (3:46)

All songs written, recorded, and performed by Ben Daniel 
Except "Fuck Bono" which was written by Ben Daniel/Chadd Haselhorst/Tom Goodbrake/Andrew Sogor
