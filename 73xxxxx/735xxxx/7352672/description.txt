
Format: Flac
Genre: Heavy prog rock
Origin: US

From NY, produced by Herman Gimbel (Sacred Mushroom) and Ornin Keepnews. Musically, it's a decent early 70's hard rock with organ & fuzz guitar. All material was penned by the leder Carlo Mastrangelo (who also played with Dion and the Belmonts). It's probably one of the few hard rock albums which features a kazoo solo!
