I've been writing music in one form or another since I was a kid. I began experimenting with multitrack recording (using multiple tape recorders) when I was a teenager, with dubious results. I have being doing home recording as a hobby for the last nine or so years; this is the first time I have shared my works in a public forum, where literally dozens of people might hear them. 




Genre	Eclectic pop
Influences	My music is a mix of a variety of styles, most of which have been defined at some time or another as "pop," with further elements drawn from the orchestral realm. Vocal influences include everything from the Beach Boys to the Mills Brothers and any group in between that made extensive use of close harmony.
