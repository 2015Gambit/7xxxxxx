Description
A bright fire blazed up again on the altar of the idols tower. The next victim is caught in the net of its own greed, reaching for the cursed gold. And itΓÇÖs not so bad that the ship is wrecked and in front of you for miles ahead lays the impenetrable jungle. After all, the golden cities beckon and wait for the brave men. Only not everyone can taste the fruit of victory.

Enjoy the famous game in the new, colourful design. Everything is simple. Out of the vortex in the middle of the sky the idols are falling, three in a row and of different colors. Collect the idols of the same color in blocks of three to clear them. Diagonally or straight, it does not matter. The main thing is to prevent the construction of the tower. Look for the golden blocks to open access to special levels. Get rewards and mine as much gold as you can.
