,sleeper31204,2012-06-16T21:18Z,How can I get half of the movie to full screen? Its extremely hard to enjoy watching this with the same movie playing beside itself. Any advice? Thx guys
,Gacy8Gein,2012-06-17T12:15Z,"@sleeper31204, its a 3D movie.
iirc, HSBS is Half Side-By-Side.
Click on Yify's name next to his green skull, and pick one of the other versions of this movie by Yify."
