,aungawa,2012-06-20T12:38Z,"so funny now. Zero seeders and 37 leechers. So progress is still zero...
FUNNY..."
,druex2,2012-06-20T21:20Z,"I wish I could help man. The person who started this was seeding for a day (I have 15% of it DLed) and then disappeared. 

I have no idea what happened, but more people need to have it in order to seed it. "
,Ann-Bonny,2012-06-21T19:59Z,"So no one has more than 15%? What happened Darkeye21?? I think you need to re-establish your initial seed. 

There are plenty of people willing to seed if they can ever get a completed file... Come on, some of us need this ASAP..."
,fourzillion,2012-06-22T01:05Z,darkey21 could you please complete seeding it and trust us we all will keep it going. We need this badly and asap. Thanks man

,32knots,2012-06-29T18:43Z,"I had decent download speeds, As soon as I finish I will seed until there is no tomorrow.  I don't take the step until April so there is no rush for me, but we need to get this up and running."
,32knots,2012-06-29T18:47Z,My share ratio is currently closing in on 5.0
,toninirvana,2012-06-30T18:18Z,"READ!***Stuck at ""16.2%"" I bet this is the 2011 version as the file size is about exactly the same!!! that cant be coincidence with 45 completely new video files with varying lengths. I bet he realized this and stopped seeding. Dont waste your time and good luck. "
,toninirvana,2012-06-30T18:29Z,Looks like the partial 16.2% RAR I got did have 2012 parts but still no progress. For the love of god if you have the complete set SEED! thank u 
,Medical.Torrents,2012-07-01T18:30Z,"Hey. I hate to hit and run, but I've been stuck at 16.2% a wile now. I'm thinking of deleting the torrent, and restarting the hunt for DIT 0'12."
,druex2,2012-07-02T16:36Z,Maybe somebody could explain this to me. When ever I check back online there is always 1-2% more available to download. Is there someone seeding the whole file- just sporadically?
