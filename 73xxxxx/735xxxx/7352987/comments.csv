,darthlightspam83,2012-06-15T00:49Z,"The included keygen / patcher is for Diskeeper 2011 v15. It does register for Diskeeper 2012, but the defragmentation engine doesn't run."
,LJUSALF,2012-06-15T01:12Z,it register but I could´nt use the patch. It was grayed out.
,botakal,2012-06-15T01:42Z,"Yes, I confirm, the defrag engine doesn't work. "
,botakal,2012-06-15T01:46Z,"LJUSALF, click generate > patch > click the 4 ""Apply"""
,LJUSALF,2012-06-15T07:18Z,"@botakal i have done that (generate), and It´s impossible to make it work  due to the patch-button don´t react.

,iOSXPC,2012-06-16T16:43Z,"This is not a virus! Please will everyone stop freaking out about false positives! Before flipping out about virus, perform better research. The included [keymaker.exe] was developed by VDOWN of the BetaMaster group and most definately NOT a virus! Learn the scene and who developes our keymakers before claming a virus.  Unfortunately the included [keymaker.exe] is for [Diskeeper 2009 v13.0.835 All Editions] and does not work for this 2012 version... ~iOSXPC~"
,Amigaland,2012-07-02T11:53Z,Any news on a working version?

,iOSXPC,2012-07-20T03:12Z,The only truly working version is here:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6951443/Diskeeper_2011_Pro_Premier_15.0.966_with_patch/  ...and unfortunately it is only for [x86] (32-bit)...  ~iOSXPC~
