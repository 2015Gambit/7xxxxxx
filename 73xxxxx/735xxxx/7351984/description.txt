Today I am pleased to announce that we are releasing Call of Duty: interMW3!

interMW3 allows you to play Modern Warfare 3 without limitation!

To start of with you need a clean copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. This can be any copy - our updater will download all of the needed files that you will require to play.

The game will use the exact same authentication system as interOps. If you haven't done so already then please register for an account at main.php. You will use the account you make there to play on the game.

Currently only the matchmaking portion of the game works, but in the future we will be include special ops and ranked dedicated servers!
