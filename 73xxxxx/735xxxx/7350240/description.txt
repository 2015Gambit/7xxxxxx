We seem to be in the midst of a quiet revolution. The likes of The Libertines have gone to bed and a new generation have taken their place. They come without hype but equipped with beautifully crafted and passionate songs. IΓÇÖm not declaring that this revolution rides on the crest of a new music wave. Far from it, but I regard this as its biggest charm: The ability to continue with a musical style whilst keeping it fresh and mesmerising. Just take a moment to consider how many times you have heard a band hyped to the point of explosion, only to be disappointed by their actual music. Or been put off by certain media people ΓÇÿchampioningΓÇÖ a song or band. The lack of hype often helps a band more than anything else. It makes you approach their music with a clear mind and an open heart. So, whilst you may have heard little or nothing about The Travelling Band, or their impending release, donΓÇÖt be put off!
