From Crop to Shop: Jimmy's Supermarket Secrets
Our supermarket shelves groan with fresh food from around the world. Farmer Jimmy Doherty explores the global logistics that bring these crops to a shop near you. He meets the people who grow our food and make this global conveyor belt work. He uncovers the science and technology that keeps food fresh for weeks or months without decay. 
Does it make any sense to transport fresh fruit and vegetables for thousands of miles by air and by sea, just so we can eat our favourite foods all year long?
