Mon pere... Gah French 1 isn't that good. xD

My Dad asked me what ""L'Enfant Suavage"" was. 

I told him ""The Savage Infant"" ... That's it right? I r gud at Francais."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-06-22T21:55Z,"Most translations are ""The Wild Child"".
Savage in english is more related to violence than in french, where it just means from nature.

And enfant =/= infant"
