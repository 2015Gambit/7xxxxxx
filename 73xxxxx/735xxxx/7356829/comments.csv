I agree completely with the 'spectacular' part and I would suggest that anyone wanting to read this amazing Persian masterpiece in English get an English translation of the book.
( http://www.amazon.com/The-Shahnameh-Persian-Book-Kings/dp/0143104934/ )

The English translation is in no way the same as reading it in Farsi, but the translation linked to does do it justice. The translation is both easy to read and at the same time conveys some of the poetic nature of the Farsi version. 

(Think about how different the English Shakespeare uses is to the English most people speak, times that by at least one hundred, and you will have the 'distance' between the beautifully poetic Shahnameh in Farsi and casual English.)
