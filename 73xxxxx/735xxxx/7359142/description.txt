6 6 "Vendetta" Juno Lee TBA June 14, 2012 (2012-06-14) MTRC1-06 0.4
 
Kane celebrates Mike's one-year anniversary as a Motorcitizen by sending a swarm of metal-eating robomites to destroy Motorcity. 
As The Burners try to stop Kane's latest attack, they find themselves sabotaged by a mysterious masked villain with ties to Mike's checkered past with Kane.  

note: wikipaedia lists this as episode 6 but the episode "Fearless" has been released by iTunes as number 6 hence 2 episodes this week :)
