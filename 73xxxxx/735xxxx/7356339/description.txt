Malaysia beckons with an astounding mix of lush rainforests, gorgeous beaches and precipitous mountains, and this latest volume in the award-winning Eyewitness Travel Guide series covers every aspect of this fascinating country.



Nature lovers can swim with colorful fish off the shores of numerous islands or spot orangutans and other exotic jungle-dwellers in Sarawak. Using the unique cutaway maps and 3-D models explore the ultra-modern skyscrapers of Kuala Lumpur and Singapore which overwhelm the colonial buildings still found in the center of both metropolises.
