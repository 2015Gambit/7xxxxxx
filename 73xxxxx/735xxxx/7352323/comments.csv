,blw78,2012-06-14T04:34Z,Question: when I download this file it doesn't download as a video file (doesn't have flv/avi/mp4 extension) but just a file that can't be opened by any software I have. What do I need to do to be able to open the 'file' as a video file once it is downloaded? Thanks a bunch for any help! B
