But how do you get these episodes under 200MB in 720p? Is it a multipass thing?"
,hichief,2012-06-17T05:47Z,"As always, great quality. I can't afford cable to watch this shit haha and you're so quick on the upload. Thanks so much!"
,TheDogs96,2012-06-17T05:56Z,Why isn't this lower than 200MB? :S

,Wizxon,2012-06-17T20:20Z,"Thanks for the upload once again, I see you have went back to 720p, which is fantastic for the file size and download speed thank you.

But, the audio and video is terribly out of sync. I've tried watching it on my laptop, 55"" plasma TV, and it's really messed up. Not sure why.

As well as I noticed you used .mkv, I have a feeling that might play a part into the syncing issues, but I just wanted to ask why you switched from .mp4 to .mkv?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-17T21:37Z,"This is before encoding into small Size 720p the Audio is perfectly synced, you probably dont have the correct codecs to play MKV files. 

The mp4 files are for xbox/ps3 users which is right here
