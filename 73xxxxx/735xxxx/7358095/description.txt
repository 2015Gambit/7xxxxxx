Safe Food- The Politics of Food Safety[Team Nanban][TPB]

Marion Nestle | English | 2010 | 408 Pages | ISBN: 0520266064 | PDF | 5.4 MB

DESCRIPTION:

"Food safety is political." So claims the title of the introduction to Marion Nestle's book Safe Food, and this assertion is solidly confirmed in the pages that follow. 
In her instructive monograph, Nestle exposes the political workings of the system that supposedly guarantees the safety of our food. 
The operation of this system is unfamiliar to many, but Nestle's well-researched and carefully documented arguments convince me that the topic should be of concern to anyone who eats.
