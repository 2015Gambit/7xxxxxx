Promo Only Urban Radio 2011 
August, October, November, December

Since there wasn't any official rips of these (at least none that i could find), and it seems like there will never be, I took it upon myself to compile the missing 2011 promo only urban radio albums. I did my best to find as many tracks from any other official promo only rips (e.g. rhythm, mainstream). I found about 2/3rds of the tracks that way. The others were gathered elsewhere, and may not be clean versions. 

Below is a list of tracks that I know are the original/dirty versions. If you have any of these songs in a clean version, or if you notice any other tracks that are obviously not radio edits, or if there's any other problems, please let me know in the comments (on thepiratebay.org).
