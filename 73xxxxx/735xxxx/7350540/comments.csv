,reduxx,2012-06-14T06:20Z,Definitely doesn't sound like 320kbps quality.
,tzeiggi,2012-07-16T07:33Z,Didn't know iTunes has 320

This is 320 kbps.
If you weren't a massive idiot you would see that before you make your dumb comments.
Great song and quality, enjoy people."

,razeke,2012-08-02T10:07Z,"Warning: This is a transcode. Some shit 128kbps converted to 320kbps. 

Sounds like shit and even Spectro reports it at 15.8khz rather than 20khz+ like a typical 128kbps rip. 

@Vasrulz

You sir are a fucking retard."

Spectro even reports it at 15khz when the actual 320kbps rip of this song is 20.7khz."

I agree with you, the original file was low quality. :P

Also the length of the original track is 3:56 (not 3:44) so it's definity not from iTunes either."

He doesn't rip anything from iTunes. They all just downloaded off random blogsites etc because at least half the songs I have downloaded from this guy are fake 320kbps transcodes."
