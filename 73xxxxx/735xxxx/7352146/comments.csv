Thanks for the upload. Too bad I already seen it."

Can't some lucky people who have already downloaded this come forward for an hour or two and share? Normally, I'm patient with slow downloads, and I always seed plenty myself to be a good citizen and all that, but really, this d/l just ain't happening. Days and days and weeks of basically NOTHING. Would at least one person step up and take responsibility for doing the right thing here?"
