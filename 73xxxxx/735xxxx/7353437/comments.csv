,VicVega,2012-06-17T15:02Z,"Hi. I haven't downloaded it but looks like it's working for those who do.

I'm just curious.... You realize that anyone can see your real name and address when they look up your domain registration info, right? Not concerned about Bill's lawyers coming knocking at your door? Had any problems like that so far?"
[V],Maherz,2012-06-19T14:41Z,"@VicVega
I don't care :)
Besides, who told you that the information there belongs to me? :)
Have you ever visited a site such as:

:))"
,shhnedo,2012-06-28T18:51Z,"@Maherz
It's all the same to me, I just thought of the people who are still using XP x64(I actually never used it).
I already tried one of your earlier ""xp integrated"" images on a vmware virtual machine and it performed very well so i thought you could make the same with sp2 x64 for the minority of people who use it."
[V],Maherz,2012-06-28T19:35Z,"@gta4fan
Anytime man :)

@shhnedo
Me too, I never used XP 64!

So I just wanted to thank you for putting up with the bullshit. You respond to every question people ask and you are very kind and friendly, unlike the loser who took your work."
,TheEndOfDays,2012-06-30T00:40Z,How would I clean install this one if I currently have s2? I want to completely remove everything when I download this.
,tanvir175,2012-06-30T03:21Z,"I first downloaded this from the guy who stole the torrent from you, because it came up first since it has more seeders and I didn't see this one. 
I downloaded it and it messed up because it said it was missing setupORG.exe
I read the comments later and someone said that it was a copy from this torrent you uploaded.
Before I try and download this one and go through the hassle, I just wanted to make sure that everything was perfect with this one so I'd just like to know if the setupORG.exe is working properly on this. Thanks."
,TheEndOfDays,2012-06-30T05:16Z,"I got everything downloaded and it worked great, until I got to trying to add the programs and such. I got a Copy Error saying ""setup cannot copy the file avtapi.dl_."" I can't figure out what to do from here."
[V],Maherz,2012-06-30T14:26Z,"@bunyslayr
Lots of people do that, this is the sign of success for me :)
Anyway, thanks for telling me.

@TheEndOfDays
Just burn the ISO into a CD with MINIMAL SPEED then boot from it.
Good luck.

@tanvir175
Yes, eveything is fine.
Just burn the ISO with MINIMAL SPEED!
Good luck."

,gta4fan,2012-07-03T23:05Z,"@Maherz, I actually had an issue the last time I used this torrent file, when I started Windows, it said explorer.exe was missing, I tried to reinstall it but FAILED, now I can't use my laptop because It won't let me because my OS was erased and I am screwed, This is the only OS i have, I broke my Windows 7 Disc long ago...PLEASE HELP...Other than that the torrent is GREAT!!"
,gta4fan,2012-07-03T23:07Z,"@Maherz, I am also using my Cell Phone to talk send messages becasuse I don't have other PC."
[V],Maherz,2012-07-04T21:31Z,"@gta4fan
You shouldn't have this issue at all!
Try burning the CD again with minimal speed.
Also, format your hard drive before installing.
Search Google how to do that.
Good luck."
,gta4fan,2012-07-05T00:59Z,"@Maherz, I got it working...Thanks alot! :)"
,eman4life,2012-07-05T03:41Z,It's not accepting the registration key you provided. :(

,platonios,2012-07-05T19:30Z,"@Maherz or others who have tested it already :

Ihave the integrated April 2011 and it works just perfect. Always the windows update is on and never had any kind of problems. Is this the same kind ? Will I be able with microsoft update ?"
,duriotic,2012-07-06T03:06Z,"@platonios:  as of now, you don't need this.  This is just the same Windows XP you have with the latest updates.  You can get this if you want to save time updating in the future, though, if you reinstall."
[V],Maherz,2012-07-06T18:01Z,"@platonios
Exactly the same! Just May and June updates added.
So if you're installing updates you don't need to download this.
You only need to download the latest release when you're installing Windows again so you will have less updates to deal with ;)

@duriotic
Thank you :)"
,JustCheap,2012-07-07T05:57Z,"Hi Maherz, this is my first time using Daemon and this whole mounting process, I mount the downloaded file and I get to the part where I start Windows Setup but it asks me to insert Windows XP CD. I thought the whole purpose of Daemon was to make the computer to believe that there's a virtual cd in it already. Please respond, thank you. "
,platonios,2012-07-07T12:35Z,"@Maherz and duriotic :

     Thanks a lot for the quick response. I really appreciate serious people , especially here on P.Bay , who give their time to help others by giving information , personal opinions , solutions e.t.c
I will download this cause I do windXP pro installations all the time... ,so I need to save time with future updates.


@ All new users : 

       It is always preferable , always to do a clean installation from the beginning. That means that if you want to change from win98,winXP Home edition,winVista or whatever operating system you have, to winXP Pro edition or what ever ''new'' operating system you want to have , first backup your personal data , collect the drivers for your motherboard,sound/vga card,camera,printer,wireless adapters e.t.c , and after that do partition/format your hard drive before you install your ''new'' operating system. 

  Note that some windows/torrents that do not need cd key and/or activation , will NOT work if you just upgrade. You will have to format your hard drive first ...e.t.c e.t.c

@ Those people that they do have problems making bootable cd/dvd disks :

    1) Always burn your disks using slow speeds
    2) If your disk doesn't work , try buying a new empty disk from a different company/trademark. Always try CD/DVD-R and CD/DVD+R because believe it or not, sometimes it does matter for your recording device and/or the device of the system that will try to boot it. Also try different software.
    3) If you don't try to download a torrent and test it by yourself, you can NOT be 100% sure about it. Pirated software is not always ''easy'' and of course sometimes is very easy and you save money... 
    4) Try to ''google'' and learn what is ''Fake virus warnings'' ,you will save energy and you will ''protect'' your nerves! LOL"
