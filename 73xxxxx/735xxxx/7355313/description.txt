This is all the episodes of The Brothers Grunt I could find after several months of searching. The episodes in the zip file unzip into 2 big mp4 files that have a bunch of episodes on them that run concurrently. In order to unzip the zip files you might need a program to do it with if you dont have one already. I suggest using winrar which you can get here at www.rarlab.com or here at www.win-rar.com. I've included all the episodes I found on sites like youtube despite their poorer quality since they include music videos that arent included in the ones from the zip file. For a description of the show check out its wikipedia entry here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Grunt . If you dont like the show dont snivel about it on here. Go drink a "vitamin water" and find some forum somewhere else to do it. No one gives a damn what you think about it. This ones for all those animation fans out there trying to scounge up some vintage Grunt stuff. You know who you are. So until suckTV (aside from Beavis & Butthead) or Antonucci realease it on DVD, this is about as good as its gonna get. VIVA LA GRUNT
