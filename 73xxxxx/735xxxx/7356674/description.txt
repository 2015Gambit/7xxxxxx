RELEASE NOTES

For centuries the kingdom of Andergast has been at odds with
neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a
lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds
are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. As the
belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks
a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that
the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is
undeserved.

However, the task will prove much more difficult than he expects,
leading him on an adventure that will take him to the borders of the
charted lands of Aventuria and beyond.
