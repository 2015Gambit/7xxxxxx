My name is Bobby Singer. In twenty-four hours IΓÇÖm gonna lose my memory. So hereΓÇÖs everything you need to know.

Monsters, demons, angels, vampires, the boogeyman under your bed: IΓÇÖve seen it, IΓÇÖve hunted it, IΓÇÖve killed it. IΓÇÖm not the only hunter out here, but there arenΓÇÖt as many as there used to be. Not near as many as there need to be. IΓÇÖve learned everything I can about every damned critter that walks, crawls, or flies, and IΓÇÖm not gonna let that all be for nothing. IΓÇÖm not going down without a fight. IΓÇÖm not letting everything IΓÇÖve learned disappear. So thatΓÇÖs what youΓÇÖre holding in your handsΓÇöeverything I know. Anything thatΓÇÖd be useful for Sam, Dean, and the hunters that come after me.

ItΓÇÖs a guide to hunting...itΓÇÖs a guide to me. My last will and testament. Ya idjits.
