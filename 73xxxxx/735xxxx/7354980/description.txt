Compressed as an .mkv file

After a 4+ year hiatus from creating torrents, I'm uploading _The Last Laugh_ compressed into .mkv file format.

Plays perfectly, but the format is new to me, and I'm getting my feet wet again, so if the file is not as small as it could be, or if there are some settings I should be tweaking for resolution, audio, or any info I should be posting here to accompany this file, please let me know for future reference.

Cheers!
