Storyline
**********

In the aftermath of last season's stellar finale, poor Lydia finds herself recovering from a werewolf mauling, not that anyone knows that's what it is, and while she's showering in the hospital, she starts oozing black stuff from various orifices and wounds while her hair falls out in clumps. Turns out it's not The Blob paying her a visit via shower drain, it's something else entirely. No matter what you call it, leaking black inky stuff from your person is probably bad.
