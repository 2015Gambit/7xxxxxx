[T],SecTPB,2012-06-17T12:23Z,"@Shiva_vb
I'm not understanding what you're trying to ask of me."
,Shiva_vb,2012-06-19T04:27Z,@SecTPB bhai Im asking u to Upload Torrent instead of magnet links Only
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-19T11:24Z,Does TPB even still have the option to upload torrent files instead of magnet links?
,Shiva_vb,2012-06-20T18:15Z,ya bro
,Pipsqk,2012-06-21T23:13Z,"You still upload the torrent FILE. If the number of leechers AND seeders combined exceeds 10, then the torrent file itself will be unavailable for download and only the magnet link will be available. TPB implemented this back in February to save space and for protection."
,Shiva_vb,2012-06-23T18:09Z,Opps IDK bout That Sorry 
,Shiva_vb,2012-06-23T18:10Z,Waiting For Todays Releases BRO
,Pipsqk,2012-06-24T00:04Z,"@Shiva_vb SecTPB released both already. Go check. Two separate torrents. Please ignore the comments about a required password on your way in. Drive safely, and I hope I didn't make you late or anything. :D"
