This short played on one of the Support New York City telethons that took place shortly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It's an enjoyable little film involving many people saying funny things on their cell phones in New York. Not only is it funny, but it's Woody's first good film since "Everyone Says I Love You." Look fast for Tony Roberts.
