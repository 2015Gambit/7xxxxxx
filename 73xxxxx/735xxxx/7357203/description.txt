This torrent was to big to upload in 1 torrent so i made two separate torrents part 1 and part 2 i put a link to the part 2 in the comments.

This is the most complete bleach soundtrack collection as of 6/15/2012 as far as i know i used http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Music and wikipedia to confirm this. This collection has everything except for Bleach B Station Season 4,5 and the music from the video games if people really want the missing music i'll try to hunt it down somehow i know i can buy B station season 4 and 5 each of these 2 seasons have like four volumes to them and they're kinda expensive so it might be a while before i have them when i do get them if i get them i'll upload them.
I got some of this soundtrack from here http://bakabt.me/153802-bleach-soundtrack-collection-flac.html i converted it from flac to mp3 and since it was very incomplete i went about completing the collection which took a lot of time hunting down the different soundtracks anyways i hope you enjoy this torrent as much as i do. Oh and by the way if i'm missing any other music from this collection besides what i mentioned feel free to let me know.
