You can view the screenshots for the video quality. (1280 x 720 HD). And the audio details are given in the description. Its a High-End 64 kbps AAC codec for audio, so the audio is fine too. :) If you have any problems, u can tell me. I would recommend to play the movie in VLC player :)"

Fully DXVA compatible. 
And also, even though highly compressed,
if muxed into MP4 with one audio stream, this will work fine in PS3 and Xbox etc!

(But I like around 400mb file size for this movie.
Reasons: These days and Future --> Fast internet, High capacity Storage. High Quality Displays :) 

Thank You Very Much!..."
