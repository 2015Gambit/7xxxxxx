The 12th Century. Following a massacre of suspected plague sufferers, one of whom has a stigmata on her foot, the church and the establishment decide to bury their secrets by building a church on the site of where the victims are buried, in order to keep the evil trapped for ever, under hallowed ground. The present day. The very same church has a new librarian, who unwittingly frees the toxic evil from its incarceration, awakening a centuries old power that begins to infect the church and its occupants one by one...
Italian director Michele Soavi, who served his apprenticeship under two great horror directors from Italy, Dario Argento and Lamberto Bava, here shows his usual creative flourishes to direct this highly enjoyable horror film. Soavi may well have only directed a handful of films, but what a great handful they are. Whilst not quite attaining the heights of his brilliant arty slasher 'Stagefright' or the endearingly bizarre 'Dellamore Dellamorte', Soavi once again delivers the goods.
