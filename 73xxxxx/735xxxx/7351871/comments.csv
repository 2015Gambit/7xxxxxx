,Hiddendriver,2012-06-16T00:22Z,AVG says virus >.< False alarm probably tho
,muff1nman,2012-06-16T05:14Z,"@SoThEr2

Alternately[sic] be a shitlord. Hamachi is a terrible program. Doesn't even work half the time. "
,TheComrade,2012-06-17T06:53Z,"hamachi is just as good as tunngle, but tunngle has a community and the sins rebellion network usually has 50-100 people in at all times"
,mrafay31,2012-06-17T16:44Z,"If anybody is looking for an active sins network on hamachi, theres a diplomacy one still going strong, but players there usually play Rebellion now. We have 3vs3's almost every day.

Network: Sins Diplomacy 1
Password: 123

If you're inactive, please dont join. You will be kicked."

Why are you being a prick? I listed an alternative program to use, maybe it doesn't like you but it works perfectly fine as if in an actual LAN for me. So go be a ""shitlord"" somewhere else."

,drscott11,2012-06-27T22:01Z,"Just use the ""dev"" exe. It's much better than any trainer. Hit CNTL+SHIFT+. to enable"
,streetbum149,2012-07-04T15:52Z,"@themidnightrider13 look up sins of a solar empire rebellion trainer and pick gamecopyworld sight. screw cheat happens i don't pay for cheats. @muffinman gotta agree with sother2, quit being an ass. plus, tunngle is better if only for the fact that its a client with pages of information rather than having to search for everything yourself. i just don't like either cause of multiplayer cheaters.
