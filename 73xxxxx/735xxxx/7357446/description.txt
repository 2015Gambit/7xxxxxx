After you have Installed your Windows 7 Ultimate OS and you're at your desktop, click on the activator. it will open Allow or don't allow box, obviously click allow. Then make sure the "Use default loader" bullet is chosen, then click install. It will tell you its going to disappear and its ok, then it will restart your computer. when its back to the desktop and then your done, its activated.
