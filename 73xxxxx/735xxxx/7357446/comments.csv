,GreenDiary,2012-07-02T12:33Z,"Some error shows up saying ""It is not Compatible with my System."""
,aaleeaa,2012-07-05T21:14Z,"WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my system is restarting on boot time"
,Q__boii,2012-07-07T17:37Z,"This is the best thing in years! Tried it with my W7 Ultimate x86 SP1 and it worked flawlessly. Then, I reinstalled Vista Ultimate x86 at my quad-core desktop machine, but I didn't have Internet access at that time, so I tried this. Guess what? It worked with Vista too! 
Gotta love solutions like this, while XP required at least 10 different cracks, before I could find anything useful.."
,Q__boii,2012-07-07T17:38Z,@ GreenDiary: maybe you're using a 64-bit version of Windows?
,ldangerx,2012-07-11T17:29Z,I love you for this.  I am using a version of windows 7 pro 64bit i received from my school on all my home computers and i have lent my serial out to some friends trying to see how many computers i can install it on.  i am running a small scale corporate network at my home as a project for school so i need professional for joining domains.   then my laptop all of sudden refused to activate.  this worked like a charm!!!  OP i will marry you for this. thanks!

,unXpected,2012-07-30T19:36Z,"Is Windows failing to boot after you installed the loader? Just do the following.

* Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk
* Select the ""Repair your computer"" option
* Select ""Command Prompt""
* Input ""bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force"" (without quotes)
* Restart the PC

Note: If the above doesn't fix your boot issue then use the command ""bootsect.exe /nt60 ALL /force"" instead. Just make sure you remove all USB flash drives before you use the command."

,MyssAngel,2012-08-16T11:27Z,"Well it will fix of fux ur machine, it's a MAJOR pain in the arse to recover the boot sector AND after recovery it still needs the activation. You decide, is it worth the risk?!?! I am pissed."
,MyssAngel,2012-08-16T11:30Z,"Maybe this will help, I use Winblows 7, 64 bit. It did NOT work!"
,JamesTuttle,2012-08-16T19:19Z,"Jules- Ur the shit!!!  It worked as promised- and AFTER I installed Ultimate SP1 64 AND ran all available windows updates.  This is PERFECT.

Thanks man!!!!  :)"
,akash2008,2012-08-24T08:12Z,"***WARNING***
This will work but you must repair the bootsector for you computer to work after the restart (in 50% of cases). Before restarting goto the start menu, type cmd and enter the following: bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force
then restart your computer. If it still doesn't work and gives you the boot compressed error you will need an install cd of windows or another way to access the dos prompt to continue.

Is Windows failing to boot after you installed the loader? Just do the following.

* Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk
* Select the ""Repair your computer"" option
* Select ""Command Prompt""
* If command prompt is not an option goto recover then cancel and it should pop up as an option
* Input ""bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force"" (without quotes)
* Restart the PC"
