Micro Safari
Through the magic of television, zoologist Nigel Marvin and his crew get shrunk down to a 1/4 inch to explore an alien world of mammoth insects, in hit National Geographic show Micro Safari. An average domestic garden becomes a perilous terrain, fraught with wasp attacks, skulking spiders, and bad-tempered millipedes. Will Nigel and the team make it back to their car to be re-enlarged in time? Or will they become lunch for a ravenous garden shrew? This fun documentary provides an adventure that will educate and entertain, making it perfect for the whole family. There are an estimated 8000 species in the average garden, so there's plenty to see.



2)  The Making of 
What's the best way to explore the miniature wilderness of a garden? Become miniature yourself! This special show sees me and my team shrunk down to the size of bugs to get close to the tiny creatures that surround us every day. With ultra high-speed video, thermal imaging goggles and remote-controlled spy cameras, I was able to capture on film some of the amazing events taking place in the backyard jungle.
