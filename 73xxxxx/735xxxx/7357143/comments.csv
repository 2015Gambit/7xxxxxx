Linkin Park Sucks "

,NTDaniel,2012-06-17T04:35Z,Very nice torrent!
,DR.SEVEN,2012-06-17T14:11Z,THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH DUDE
,SirTwitch,2012-06-17T21:35Z,"Yes, this is oh so legit."
,Zone09,2012-06-17T23:38Z,You have taken by far the best band in the world with biggest fan base and destroyed every fans joy in waiting for the release date and thrown it out of the window because we(the fans) are going to be exposed to this even if we dont download it. You Sidcookie has destroyed an album by trying to distribute before hand and depriving millions of others by taking away their joy of opening the cd cases on the due date or at least only being able to pirate it 24 hours after release. I think you are a selfish asshole and should go bury yourself in a ocean of shit. I as respected sound engineer despise things like this! 
,lfmaf,2012-06-18T03:13Z,@Zone09 wow... looks like someone is overreacting...
,Zicamox,2012-06-18T05:12Z,"@Zone09 Most fans don't rely so heavily on the sentimental aspect of an album's release. It's pretty easy to avoid exposure to this album being leaked anyway. Just don't go on piratebay, wait a few more days for the official release, and buy your copy however you want."
,boredsick,2012-06-18T05:42Z,@Zone09 I created an account just to say this to you. You sir make some good points. May I offer a rebuttal? Go fuck yourself with a cactus. The fuck are you doing on a torrenting site then?
[V],sidcookie,2012-06-18T12:39Z,"it never fails to amaze me, how ppl who dont uploading anything or contribute in anyway to the website.. always manage to find something to crib about.. its just sad..."
,dam73x,2012-06-18T17:59Z,@sidcookie u are the man dude :)) great upload and  top album......cheers !!

,Weaves89,2012-06-18T23:14Z,Thank you so much Sid! Forget Zone09 he is just retarded... Keep putting up awesome torrents!
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-06-19T00:35Z,"I can't even begin to tell you how nice it is to finally see some decent music in The Pirate Bay 'Top 100'. 

All these teenage kids are swamping TPB with a deluge of Katy Perry, Adele, LMFAO, and Kanye West bullsh*t, when what we need is more quality!"

,insect33,2012-06-20T11:14Z,"@BaronVonWatermelon


totally agree man...i'm also tired of always seeing crap music in piratebay top100..not good for the artist though..:p"
,BosnianTrekker,2012-06-20T12:53Z,"torrent is excellent, but the album? it's hard to find linkin park in this thing, what the hell happened to their music??"
,momsson,2012-06-20T15:20Z,perfect thx!
,trainheartnet444,2012-06-20T17:22Z,Thx cookie great song quality the albumis pretty average I love linkin parks 2000s albums IE meteora hybrid theory but the first three songs on this album are good but the rest of the songs are just fillers and sounds like shit
,pramod99,2012-06-21T05:53Z,Awesome man. i love you! 
,gotestra,2012-06-22T13:22Z,"Zone09,
I respect your views. I really do. I mean, as a sound engineer, you must see something that I don't.But please, you're on a torrent site. 90% or more of the people who come here don't find a POINT in paying for software, or music, or videos unless they're good. I know some people who torrent video games, then if they like it, they buy it. Its the same for music. A bunch of people grabbed it early. Maybe 90% of the users wont buy it again, but the remaining 10% will. The remaining 90%, including me, would have gotten it once its released anyway. Not everybody's rich enough to afford paying for music albums whenever they want to."
,jyotir4,2012-06-22T19:46Z,i will seed it 4 ever
,kurohyoneko,2012-06-24T21:24Z,"As a rule, I usually seed a torrent for about a week after DL.

This, I will seed for months.  Thank you!"
,youronlyfriend,2012-06-25T09:34Z,is this as shit as their last album
,Finalflax,2012-06-25T13:13Z,"Yay!
i can go back to pretending A Thousand Suns never happened!"
,youronlyfriend,2012-06-26T06:19Z,not as bad as thousand suns but still shit WTF happened to them
,Madarali,2012-06-26T17:54Z,"Hi guys.

and  Zone09: 
People like me cant buying original CDs. becouse singers or bands like LINKIN PARK are illegal in our's country [iran] and their products are inhibited.

And i am agree with you in quality of MP3 but we can't put audio CDs to our Portable MP3Players."
,smurph89,2012-06-27T01:17Z,thanks works great sounds perfect 
,Balthesaur,2012-06-27T01:22Z,"Audio quality is great, but the album is crap. Too much techno/dance influence and not enough rock. 

Thanks for the upload anyway!"
,jaaskocody15,2012-06-27T06:51Z,"OMG finally!!, i feel bad for pirating their music but i dnt have money to spend on any of it, but awesome upload!! dl in about 45 sec. +1 for you pal!! True to what you say, 320kbps whole album!!"

,raynrev,2012-06-29T20:46Z,"Excellent album, much better than the last two.

If you enjoy this music as much as I do, PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AND BUY THE ALBUM. Show Linkin Park that we still reward those who make good music."

,Pepenews,2012-07-20T19:07Z,"@Zone09 As a respected student I tell you it's ""an ocean"" and not ""a ocean"".
Also, if you wanted to open the CD case you just don't download this and wait to buy the CD and STFU and stop calling people an asshole for trying to help others who can't afford it or are like me, who live in a country where it's impossible to get the album."
,Pepenews,2012-07-20T19:44Z,"BTW I forgot to rate and comment. It's a very nice quality and a nice upload.
Thanks!"

You are right and thats why im not dling it. im buying it."
,aztralcap,2012-08-17T01:37Z,thanks much
,TheMXL,2012-08-19T03:46Z,Thanks so much!
,grephol,2012-09-07T08:30Z,"@Zone09, you are either:
A.) Yet another MPAA hire, diligently doing your job of protecting a dying business.
B.) A troll, and should fuck yourself. If you are, I'm sure you do frequently.
C.) Genuinely in love with the act of opening a CD, and therefore stupid. Seriously, man/woman/dude/chatbot, I haven't opened a CD since 1999 or so. 

Also, @Zone09. Linkin Park has sucked for years, and I only downloaded this because of your comment.  I don't know that I'll even listen to it, but I KNOW I wouldn't ever pick it up to buy at a store. I know I'm not the only person thinking that.

The music industry needs to realize their days of ""play a song on the radio and people will overpay for an album"" are over. It's that simple. People want good music and are not willing to put up with bullshit. That includes ""respected sound engineers"" whose greatest pleasure in life revolves around unwrapping plastic on the day that a studio designated."
