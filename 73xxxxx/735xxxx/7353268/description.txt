Micro Safari
Through the magic of television, zoologist Nigel Marvin and his crew get shrunk down to a 1/4 inch to explore an alien world of mammoth insects, in hit National Geographic show Micro Safari. An average domestic garden becomes a perilous terrain, fraught with wasp attacks, skulking spiders, and bad-tempered millipedes. Will Nigel and the team make it back to their car to be re-enlarged in time? Or will they become lunch for a ravenous garden shrew? This fun documentary provides an adventure that will educate and entertain, making it perfect for the whole family. There are an estimated 8000 species in the average garden, so there's plenty to see.




3)  Alligators 
Nigel Marven travels to Florida to study the natural history of the American alligator. This film was made throughout 2001, one of the driest years in recent Florida history. As a result, it was a great time to see gators and study their habits. My crew captured incredible behaviour; courtship dances, fighting, cannibalism and nest construction. I managed to fulfil a dream by getting right up close to a mother gator tenderly taking her babies to the water in her mouth. At one point I donned a miniature camera on my forehead, so that we could film close-up views of the inside of a gator's open mouth. The end result was spectacular, but I nearly lost my arm in the process, my heart still hammers when I think about that.
