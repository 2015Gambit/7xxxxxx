Seriously good documentary on the Punk Rock scene in 1970's Britain.

Episode 3 of 3 (1978-1981)

Including extremely rare footage and interviews with some of the lesser known as well as the main players 

A fascinating insight into how and why this cultural movement happened - why the hell has there been nothing like it since...


Please seed 

Thanx
