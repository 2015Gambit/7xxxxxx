I imagine you have a lot of ebooks (an understatement). What software do you use to manage them?

Thanks again."
[V],bigbluesea,2012-06-16T21:32Z,"Hello vuddha,

Well actually,I don't use software to manage my books.It would be almost  impossible,time wise to put them all in a software program.All my books are on my personal servers approx 300,000 books and I get new ones every day.

I don't read as much  as I would like to due to time,with uploading,kids and running a business,my time pretty much is gone.

I do suggest you try ""Calibre'' it free and seems to be popular :)"

Your welcome"

Keep up the good work!"
