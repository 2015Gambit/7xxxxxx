,lordmew,2012-06-16T18:37Z,"""Remember if you have playback issues to follow the above suggested guide. Thanks.""

the alternate solution is to install zoom player to use the ""install center"" to update the CCCP codecs, and if that doesn't work go ahead and change the settings.

PS: thanks :)"

,bochkin,2012-06-17T09:09Z,"very strange - first episode, that my tv can't play normally - strong audio lang. by the way, all your previous releases i watched without any problems"
,Yoshiseed,2012-06-17T09:34Z,"Why the heck does the video lag after the audio, after 14 mintues.

Video gets really slow unless i keep hitting the track. The audio is normal...   Its like this with all the new episodes of korra.. ? Help please. Its bloody annoying."
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-17T12:21Z,"@Yoshiseed
What are you using to play it? 
What media player? 
What OS? 
What codecs?
What kind of PC specs do you have?
Have you already tried the suggestion I wrote in the description?"
,ImagineerSparks,2012-06-18T03:53Z,V:10/A:5  The audio sounded like I was listening through a pipe or something.
,firexninja,2012-06-18T14:51Z,thank you!
,xhizors,2012-06-19T02:42Z,what the fuck is up with the 700MB file when you can encode this nicely into 200MB. Fucking waste of time and space.
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-19T05:03Z,"@xhizors
Go and encode it then. Waste of time and space? No. People want to also see it how it aired, not how it was encoded. There are multiple other copies out there if this isn't for you. Your comment is a waste of time and space.

@ImagineerSparks
Has to do with your codecs or player then. Use as suggested above."
,andy18797,2012-06-23T13:12Z,"could u please get the next ep, its like the hour long special"
