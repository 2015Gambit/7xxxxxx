This is the Windows: The Official Magazine from July 2012 complete with an ISO rip of the cover disc and JPEG scans of the front and back of the disc sleeve.

The magazine is a PDF copy of the magazine.

To use teh ISO you'll need to either burn it using something like BurnIMG or Nero or mount it as a virtual drive with something like MagicDisc.

The magazine for May and June is also available with teh cover disc rip which I've put up onbut you have to ask it to search the releases which I don't understand - hence why I'm uploading it here!
