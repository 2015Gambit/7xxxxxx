[b]NOTE: High hits on report, but most use terms "generic", "possible", "riskware, "Suspicious", 
etc. If you have used CORE's keygens before you know the score - if you haven't, choose whatever keeps your undies clean.


NOTE: "Keygen.exe" is from an earlier CORE release and still works just fine.[/b]
As with all CORE releases, start CORE10K.EXE to verify CRC of keygen.
f1 - begin CRC check
f4 or ESC - exit.
do nothing - enjoy muzic.
