,zingo_punkbuzter,2012-06-13T19:20Z,"This file was downloaded from
fixmyelin dot tk

I dont know why piratebay removed the link in the description, but the site is down, and the only thing keeping it alive these days is by sharing it, which I'm doing right now.
Hope I wont remain the only one cuz that would suck, the end of the world! (not really)
Anyways, hope you guys and girls enjoy the textures!"
,zingo_punkbuzter,2012-06-13T19:20Z,"Oh I forgot to mention 1 thing. There is a small glitch in the character creation menu after patching the game.
The Elin character might appear totally transparent (except for the face), but it wont happen again once you have selected the Elin race, when you have selected it, it will show up just as it does on the Korean version of the game."
