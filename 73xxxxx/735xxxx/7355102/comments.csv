[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-16T01:27Z,"USE MEdia player Classic, Download K-lite pack."
,wankstahh,2012-06-16T05:43Z,but how do you compress a file? isnt it just a player?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-16T07:00Z, I mean for the anime USE MPC to watch it.
,wankstahh,2012-06-16T12:45Z,"haha no, VLC works perfectly fine for me to watch anime. I dont need help on how to watch it, i need help on how to make big 720p anime files from taka subs that are 700mb and make them smaller to about 124 mb like you do. I need help on how to make files smaller not how to watch a file :)"
