[V],globeplus,2012-06-13T13:02Z,"Plot

The beginning of Outbreak is set a couple of days after the initial outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City, moments before the crisis erupts into complete chaos. The game starts with the eight characters at J's Bar, unaware of what is happening until a lone zombie wanders into the bar and attacks one of the employees named Will. After that the characters must make it through the city. The game ends in the final moments of the same incident, with the player attempting to escape Raccoon City before the U.S. government launches a missile strike to eliminate the threat posed by the T-virus. The player controls one of eight characters, or numerous supporting characters who can be selected in their place. Gameplay events transpire across various regions of Raccoon City and span over a period of several days.

There are five individual scenarios in this game, though they are not set in a chronological order. The first, ""Outbreak"", is set at the beginning of the outbreak, as the police prepare to destroy the zombie horde through explosives. ""Below Freezing Point"" deals with the events in the former underground laboratory of Umbrella before the events of Resident Evil 2, where a rogue virologist attempts to steal bio-weapons research. ""The Hive"" involves the survivors taking refuge in the Raccoon General Hospital, which is also featured in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, while it is under assault from a colony of infected leeches. ""Hellfire"", set the same day as ""Outbreak"", involves a group of survivors fleeing into a hotel that turns out to be on fire and swarming with lickers. The final scenario, ""Decisions, Decision"", consults the survivors' search for a cure to the T-virus, which sends them to Raccoon City University, in which the 8 different characters must wisely choose a decision in order to survive the puzzling secrets hidden in the university; they must then escape the city before it is destroyed."

- at the interface for all the games series with the last game it will happen 1 exception : the Resident Evil Revelations it is only for the 3DS game system that it is similar to the NDS but with 3D graphics having the main roms or in the case isos with much more size than the NDS roms , this little talk it is to say that for the moment no 3DS correct emulation for the PC what makes the acception of the fact that this game will be an exception on this conception to presenting all the game series worked for the less size possible keeping the gameplay intact in all of them , so we will get all the Resident Evil collection more pratical as possible with an exception of 1 game for 3DS , maybe in the future the games company decide to make this game in another platform , NDS for example ... why not ? see all of you and the followers of this work on this collection can expect a few more files with the remaining games not presented yet from this series , i am still making lot of research in techniques on the ripping work and i am in love with the work , the next file probably can be the file#2 of the Resident Evil Outbreak that will need a similar work than this one , what means in the pratic lot of work but really worthy in hard disk space and downloading size ... i think in few days i will have him ready because i canÂ´t stop my research for the moment ... happy day to all off you ."

[V],globeplus,2012-06-16T23:03Z,"To dieagain20113 : yes and of course must be but the emulation it is perfect and the game looks like a PC game with a created appropriated executable that launch the game in fullscreen without the need of running the emulator , choose your keys or gamepad and here you go ... the PS2 emulation improved a lot in the last few years and in many games on the emulator you feel so confortable that looks like complete normality beeing playing with the emulator on the PC and having the game pratical as this it is a matter to ask : it is worthy burn the disc to play in a real playstation 2 and the gamepad work fine and everything ?... well , that it is up to the users of the file and happy game to all of you ... from me i just want to finish saying that the Outbreak File 2 it is beeing worked with care and soon will be uploaded continuing from myself the work on this fantastic Resident Evil series ... see you .

,dieagain20113,2012-06-19T15:26Z,"this looks interesting, how do I load action replay cheat code if it skips pcsx2.exe?  this game is a bit difficult for me. T-virus %, hp, bullets, stupid team AI, puzzle, damn breakable doors.....and so on."
