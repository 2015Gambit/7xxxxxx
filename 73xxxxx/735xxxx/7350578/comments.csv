[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-06-22T04:11Z,"Anybody know why this sucker won't download? I've been trying to get it rolling for days, but no luck. Even though it says I've got between 17 and 31 (that was the biggest number I saw) Seeds it won't go above .1 or .2 kbs on the download speed. "
,KingPumpkinX,2012-06-23T05:09Z,Could someone PLEASE seed this? I'd really appreciate it...been looking forever for this stuff!
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-06-23T21:39Z,I would seed it if it would ever download. Slowest download I've ever seen on Pirate Bay. The thing just won't move.
