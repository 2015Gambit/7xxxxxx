"The Fall" was recorded by Gorillaz during their 2010 North American tour using an iPad. The album was released in a limited edition vinyl pressing for Record Store Day 2011. This rip was taken directly from the 180g vinyl. Keep in mind this album was recorded on an iPad, so the fidelity is somewhat lossy to begin with.
