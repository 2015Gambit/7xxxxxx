[H],HeroMaster,2012-06-15T05:04Z,ENJOY Diablo 3 New Emulator Server for which we all were waiting for by MADCOW!
,xasti,2012-06-15T05:21Z,"I see that the author has created a lot of torrents, but still wait for entry on the scene"
,xasti,2012-06-15T05:25Z,"fake. ""Current version of Mooege Emulator doesn't support Diablo III release version"""
,dubai1991,2012-06-15T05:31Z,working???
,cschrille1,2012-06-15T05:38Z,"Well i normally trust HM, but whenever its D3 i get suspicious. Gonna DL and try."
,CrankyAVM,2012-06-15T06:02Z,Hero I love you but I'm confused - the readme file for this emulator says that it doesn't work with the release version yet. Think i'll wait it out but people more tech savvy than me are free to try.
,Kisogo,2012-06-15T06:08Z,... Does this mean we can finally play the freakin game?
,geriatre,2012-06-15T06:14Z,"I compiled and followed the instructions, no errors in the log, the game is launching but when i log in with ""test@"" and pass ""123456"" it gives me the ""wrong login information"" error as if I wasn't connecting to the server.
This thing looks like it might be working, but not for me."
,Redistrust,2012-06-15T06:15Z,"It's real - it was released officially by Skidrow. There are some bugs, but it's real. Just registered for this purpose aha."
,dubai1991,2012-06-15T06:26Z,not working for me....!!!
,dubai1991,2012-06-15T06:29Z,do i need the diablo 3 updated version????
,Redistrust,2012-06-15T06:30Z,"After trying it out, I can say that there are way too many bugs. First quest gate is bugged - zombies don't get up for the 'attack' on the city, and you can just open the city gates. After that, if you talk to the first person you see, it says ""Cannot find actor, using player instead"", to which it then crashes.

Though it does somewhat emulate a server, you should wait until some of the bugs are worked out before seriously trying to play."
,bigdaddy153,2012-06-15T07:24Z,call me a noob but it keeps saying login information incorrect.. please help someone

There will be NEVER EVER 100% working game like official servers. The best we can hope is for something more or less decently working - like private WOW server for example. And I really hope it will take them no more then around 6 months to reach that level. I could be easily wrong but thats what i thinks as realistic."

Again this is not an official version, and even not an alpha verson. Cause when you download it, it just an project with all source code.

One more info for you all. This server emulator is a very very VERY BIG project.  I saw one before, its a private server project of Silk Road Online. This thing cost them over a year to complete it. And of couse with a lot of help all over the world when they given their source code and request for some help.

Back to this d3 server. When this thing complete over, it will containt around 20~50Mb source code. A simple imagining, just open a Note Pad and try to fill it will 20Mb letter.... hm... crazy eh?   NO there are some guys trying to fill this server emulator more than 20mb text, and of couse its all have themselves logistic.

Back to me. Who the f@#k i am, why the f@#k i'm saying this. Ok im a stupid asshole programer, and i can't even help them with my stupid programing skill. But at least i don't give a f@#k on their trying."

Thank you for your continuous dedication making the this possible for the rest of us.
Devalued money, horrible economy just does not give me much room to put out the price towards developer. Many times their product shows they don't care for their consumers, sad really."
