Unlike Web browser--Firefox, Microsoft Office does not use tabs, so the users can't see at a glance all the documents they're working on, and it's not easy to switch between them. Office Tab solves the problem by putting tabs on Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. It is an Office add-in designed for Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel, which will bring the tabbed browsing, editing and managing into user interfaces. With Office Tab, you can easily open multiple documents to be contained within a single window, using tab for switching sets of documents. Office Tab includes three Office add-ins: Workbook Tabs for Excel, Document Tabs for Word and Presentation Tabs for PowerPoint.
