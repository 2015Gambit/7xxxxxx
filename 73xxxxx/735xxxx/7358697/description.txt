Zhang Yimou's masterpiece, based on the novel of the same name by Yu Hua.  The film is slightly more upbeat than the book (the main character is left with some family at the end of the film, whereas the novel leave him with only an ox).  Despite all the tragedy and hardship the director manages to make a supremely optimistic film.  The title is apt.
