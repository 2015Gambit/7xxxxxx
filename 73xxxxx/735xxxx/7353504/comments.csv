,quellochepassa,2012-06-14T16:28Z,someone tried this one out? does invalid text still persist? why is the torrent smaller than official patch? (and supposed-to-be-skidrow one)
,Lefty85,2012-06-14T21:41Z,"the new skidrow update which i bet that this here is

still has corrupted text and now a bonus...u get a crash 2 desktop as soon as it loads up the menu after the intro videos...

skidrow fukked this up somehow...."
,Lefty85,2012-06-14T21:43Z,"i just downloaded patch 1.12 again and just installed it AFTER i installed update 1.13b ( this one here )

and its working again....up to patch v1.12 its working fine...everything later is fukked"
,Freemium,2012-06-14T22:14Z,"People, how is that possible that it doesnt work for you! It works for me, no crashes no error. Yes.. I have seen like 2 times a german text while loading, but thats all. Everything is fine. Should I make some video to prove you, that this torrent is working? In main menu I see -> Build 1.13b (Final Jun 8 2012). I first installed some Skidrow JABIA, Skidrow 1.12, Skidrow 1.13b, and the last one was this pack. I could torrent my whole JABIA folder. "

,adelubu,2012-06-15T07:00Z,are DLCs playable??
,bcr31,2012-06-15T07:12Z,"Guys, I've been following this issue in Kalypso forum
http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=15140

So, as you can see in last 3 posts, official fix is coming, so I guess there will be fix for teese versions as well."
,bcr31,2012-06-15T11:31Z,"btw this method still crash for example when loading City of Cambria. Drop out to desktop. So, have to wait for proper fix.
Didn't try DLCs. Text boxes seems ok.

,quellochepassa,2012-06-15T12:55Z,"The problem is not about the torrent working or not (or at least not all about that). The fact is that once you upgrade the game with the skidrow patches after the 1.13, the game get a lot of issues. The game updates, that's sure, and you can see it by reading 1.13b top left in the main menu, but the skidrow's updates are somehow... wrong! First of all, you get the invalid text scripts on a lot of icons, then you do not see the dlc box in main menu, and at the end, all the other minor bugs (like localization errors and so on).

There is something that is wrong with latest skidrow-supposed-to-be releases for this game. And nothing is done to solve it."
,Lefty85,2012-06-15T14:08Z,"i would take care with this one...i dont say the uploader upped maicious code here or added it....

but its weird since the original exe files from skidrow release dont give me any alerts from ESET ( anti virus ) 

but the exe files included here give me alerts...

whereever u got this from something is not right with it....at least with the exe files....."
,Lefty85,2012-06-15T14:11Z,"the point is that im pretty sure that the same exe files ( crack from skidrow ) are used here but give me an alert 

while the other official skidrow release i got from a diffrent tracker doesnt give me any alerts...."
,bobby358,2012-06-15T23:20Z,THIS update works and game doesnt crash so thx for it mate.
,defiledchaos,2012-06-19T08:35Z,do this include the new patch to fix the cambria bug? If so thanks and thanks for uploading this.
,xebx,2012-06-24T19:31Z,"It works ok.

Thanks for it.

,w_sorceror,2012-06-25T18:42Z,You can fix Cambria bug by replacing level files from version 1.12. Here are 2 files you need (place them into /bin_win32/levels in game directory) http://filesave.me/file/18866/levels-rar.html
,Frogstar1988,2012-07-26T03:17Z,Thank you for the upload and I really thank you @w_sorceror The Cambria Fix works perfectly
