Adapted excerpt from Altar's bio at Myspace:

"Formed in 2001 with two guys (Macau and VMC) and a good
formula, Altar are among the hottest breaking news of house
music today. As DJs and producers at heart, Altar play in
the top clubs in Brazil, maintaining a special bond with
their public."

Adapted and translated excerpt from Amannda's bio at her
web site:

"Amannda conquered her spot in the recording industry's
electronic scene in 2006, the year she signed up with
Brazilian producer duo Altar."

Adapted and translated excerpt from Rafael Lelis' web site:

"Sanno Solavas is the name of the side project Rafael Lelis
created in April 2008, the two being the same person. The
difference lies in the material released under one name or
the other (mostly club and tribal house from Lelis, and
progressive, freestyle and electro house from Solavas)."
