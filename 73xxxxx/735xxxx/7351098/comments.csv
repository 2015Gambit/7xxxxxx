,oxman2001,2012-09-10T16:19Z,"Lovely like always, good work ChattChitto. Could you please identify a song in the installer for Workspace Macro Pro?  Something like ""Mommy, there's no plane up in the sky."" Also can you give me any instructions on how to retrieve my status at the ChattChitto forum site? Was a member and lost computer, all data and had to change email. I know my userid but not p/w or which of many emails I registered with. Thanx, you rock!"
