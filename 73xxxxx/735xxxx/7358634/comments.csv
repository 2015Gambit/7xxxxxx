,sweeem,2012-06-16T17:20Z,What is difference between this and those other emulators?
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2012-06-16T17:22Z,Are the quests working?
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2012-06-16T17:23Z,ok...
,ufodave1947,2012-06-16T17:29Z,Why is it 16GB? Does it work any better than the other mooege emulator- ie - can you do the quests?
,opitester,2012-06-16T17:35Z,"hey,T.F.K thx for upload, but may i ask why it's 16g?. thanks"
,T.F.K,2012-06-16T17:49Z,"This is last upload in skidrow site,this is full game with emulator server,simple install,if work write here to others know,comments about this are positive,many guys say its working,have some bugs but its working and is great..:)"
,Slomaa,2012-06-16T17:49Z,It's the game + server emulator. U can see 2nd position of install instructions that it says to run setup.exe and install the game. 
,Kortzen,2012-06-16T18:09Z,"I'm a bit skeptical too about the 16gb..Though I dont know much about server emu.

I own the retail game and the game-install folder is just below 8gb on my comp :P"

,xsanders,2012-06-16T18:42Z,"I belive the size is due to the files on the server side... read the forum to understand a lot of issues so far http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?f=239&t=489764

,SasquatchSK,2012-06-16T20:27Z,well at least 25 people must have it installed it by now. They either are too busy playing the game or just don't want to comment.
,GObonzo,2012-06-16T20:31Z,"emulators i've seen are not SKIDROW or REVOLT! just because some dumbass hosts a site, puts skidrow in the title, and uploads shit there does not mean it's released by SKIDROW!
if it's not by VIP scene uploaders it is not real scene release.
working emulator so far i've seen is MADCOWmooege. same thing this guy's claiming is SKIDROW bs."

,gboorka91,2012-06-18T14:08Z,"For me it works like a charm by following the instructions. But this is worse than a beta. Found around 20 enemies among 4 territories, can pick up 1 quest and can not do it. It drops gold like crazy, and rare stuffs. Mostly, you can check the graphics and run around. Even some monsters model missing, and some icons in inverntory. Some portals broken too. However, i've checked the graphics, i like the bit-wow style, gonna buy it."

,axinte,2012-07-01T11:51Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
