Heartbeat - Series 6 (1996) [TVRip (XVID)]

...

There is an issue with the aspect ratio for the file for episode 7 - "HeartBeat S06E07 Snapped (15 Jan 2008) Requested.avi". VLC and other modern video players will allow this to be corrected while viewing. It appears that Windows Media Player will not. The aspect ratio flag for that file is set to 16:9. But it should have been set to 4:3. So view the video with the aspect ratio overridden to 4:3.

OVERVIEW
========

Heartbeat is set in the 1960s, in the fictional Yorkshire town of Aidensfield.
