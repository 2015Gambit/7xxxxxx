,evils007,2012-06-16T16:33Z,this movie is bullshit
,andymcmahon,2012-06-16T16:55Z,is it a fake or the real deal
,Gacy8Gein,2012-06-16T17:36Z,"Its likely the Real Deal, as Froggie100 is a respectable uploader.
Not to confuse with ""Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter"" which is the good film aa lot of people are waiting for.
This is a direct to video piece of bullshit, much like the ""Battle of Los Angeles"" crap that came out just before ""Battle : Los Angeles"""
,Lord-Darkstorn,2012-06-19T06:48Z,Yeah people are going to be confused...this is trash. Hopefully entertaining trash though.
,zilder,2012-06-19T13:45Z,This is the B MOVIE!!! FUCK THIS
,rogerm68,2012-06-19T21:35Z,"This is the ""mockbuster"". A low-budget movie that rips off an upcoming blockbuster in an effort to deceive people. These things should be illegal IMO.

Still, thank you uploader, going to give this a look-see if just for D-grade movie laughs."
,napalm6666,2012-06-19T23:10Z,When do Abraham lincoln* Vampire Hunter come ???
,aa1234779,2012-06-20T06:34Z,"I wonder how smart the 3000+ seeding this?

do something more useful with the bandwith!!!"
,OsamaBinJackin,2012-06-20T06:55Z,the world is full of stupid people what makes you think you can escape them here
,kimchi18,2012-06-20T11:28Z,almost fooled me.... NOT!
,MitchAllen,2012-06-20T13:51Z,"Knew it was the ""Spin off"" of the other movie but how is the A/V ? the pics look funny enough to grab my attention. "
,Aim_To_Maim,2012-06-20T16:13Z,Another Asylum piece of shit rip off film I didn't download! 
,Powerslave0,2012-06-21T07:58Z,"The real movie, in theaters soon, is with Vampires, this cheap imitation is Zombies. "
,starlite2,2012-06-21T08:34Z,"awesome... yet another HiDef rip wrapped in a 1992 era *.avi
   //// when  //// will //// this //// shitty //// wrapper //// finally //// die?? ////

froggie100 I realize you probably didn't rip this, and I appreciate the post, but the next time you see the ripper please smack him. Thank you."
,marcos.nery,2012-06-21T19:14Z,this movie is bullshit 
,macwtf,2012-07-13T08:56Z,"@OsamaBinJackin
""the world is full of stupid people what makes you think you can escape them here""

That's funnier than watching the shithead next door put an axe into his foot 'cos he was too busy watching my girlfriends ""puppies""! 

This place is not an escape from them, it's more like a breeding ground. "
,metalyger,2012-07-28T11:27Z,"This is a rare case where the b-movie knock off was actually more interesting than the real movie. It's a pretty solid zombie, it has some clever writing, good acting, and overall it's a fun movie."
,DragonChaserKev,2012-09-21T21:13Z,"I think the budget of this was 150,000 so not much and it is a direct to video knock off but it isn't bad.  A decent story, a little long, bad acting except for the man playing Lincoln.  Ok zombies who take standing naps.  And an ending which works, loved the ending.  I didn't download this copy so not sure of it's quality but the movie is OK, not great.  Probably just as good as Vampire Hunter :P"
