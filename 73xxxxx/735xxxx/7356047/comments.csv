,JamesIGTM,2012-06-16T03:05Z,"Hi Guys,

My name is James Swirsky - Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m one of the two people who made Indie Game: The Movie. Myself and Lisanne Pajot spent our last two years working on this film.  We kept a pretty active blog about the production of the film on our site ( http://www.indiegamethemovie.com ).

We are a two person team, making this film completely independently. And we want to keep on making films for your enjoyment.

If you like the movie, consider purchasing it over on iTunes, Steam or completely DRM-Free (in a variety of encodes) directly from us over at www.IndieGameTheMovie.com. You can also get a copy to gift to a friend if youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;d like to.

Thanks for taking an interest in our film.

-James Swirsky
Co-director/Maker of Indie Game: The Movie

,asKesYs,2012-06-16T17:56Z,"Dear James,

Thank you for you message, and for not asking us to remove the file. We support indipendent productions and we were not aware this was one of those. We have not watched the film yet, so we could not imagine. Although the file will stay up, we hope that this will be good for you to spread the word, to reach as many people as possible, and to make your work accessible to everybody. 

We would like to make a donation, if that is possible, and it would be great if those who enjoyed the movie would do the same.

Thank you,
asKesYs
