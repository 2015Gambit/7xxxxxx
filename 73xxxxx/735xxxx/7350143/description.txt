While many were hopeful that diplomacy would finally end the war,
differing opinions on what should be done, along with the depleted
power of the controlling factions, has led to a splintering of the
groups involved

The loyalist members of the Trader Emergency Coalition adopt a policy of
isolation, focusing on enhanced defenses to ride out the rest of the war.
Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view,
coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately
crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos
