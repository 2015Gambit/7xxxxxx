,DreaD151,2012-06-19T16:02Z,hahah its been halted at 76% for me for like three days i wish someone  who has it would at least tell us is it the one that has been floating around with the very poor audio or a new source..... no matter TvTeam thanks for the effort as with all who provide us with open source movies lol .... oh until someone gives on the seeding thing  or tells us its the bad copy we are all stuck i am afraid.....
,raa714,2012-06-25T10:34Z,"Man has a good point,for a week I have been on and not one seeder out of the 7 is ever online to let any of the leechers get over 76.6 per cent where noone can finish the dl. All one seeder would have to do is get on for alittle bit to give us the remaining 25 or at least tell us if this is the same copy as the rest and we are wasting our time-tv team-very disappointed."
,DreaD151,2012-06-25T16:37Z,"It is the same copy, I took my 76% and watched it on VLC and it is the same copy ... Looks like TvTeam Brightened up those darks spots but did nothing with audio. I tried filtering it every way possible and it still sucked. No point folks..... to many leach not enought seeds its deadlocked and its the same copy..... ohh what happened too all these HD smart phones and handi cams? Jan2012 Cams cam in looking like TS and R5 recorded on a iphone ...."

,tflagger997,2012-07-02T00:01Z,"It is 1.42GB which means the moron who made this does not know what they are doing.  This is a CAM not a DVD, so it should only be about 700MB at most.

TvTeam should be downgraded for passing on other people's crap and putting their name on it."
,DreaD151,2012-07-02T17:31Z,I just cant believe people are letting it sit on there download list just peckin away when were sittin here telllin them same copy and its deadlocked  when they do if they do get it theyre gonna be pissed cause that audio sounds like shit and it hurts your ears it sounds like fingernails real nails and broken glass being scrapped across a chalk board!!! yikes!
