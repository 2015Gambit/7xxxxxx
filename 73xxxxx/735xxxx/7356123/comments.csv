[T],relentlesstech,2012-06-15T18:24Z,What do you mean 'fake' ??? I copied this with my OWN DVR! o_O
[T],relentlesstech,2012-06-15T18:26Z,Oh sh*t - My mistake! I made the torrent with the wrong video - I'll have it fixed in a few minutes - I'm sorry for that!
,MauXesparza75,2012-06-15T23:38Z,"Nice try, you idiot!!!"
,itool,2012-06-16T02:54Z,Thanks in advance! I'll wait. 
,itool,2012-06-16T02:56Z,This person uploads a sh!tpot of stuff. Why the hate?
,itool,2012-06-16T03:00Z,"You've uploaded S02E08 of Fairly Legal, though. Unless anyone wants to watch that, they shouldn't download this."
,killbat,2012-06-16T03:38Z,FAKE!!!
[T],relentlesstech,2012-06-16T15:54Z,"Wow ... I goof up ONCE, and all the GOOD torrents I've posted get 'forgotten' ... NOBODY'S PERFECT! I was in a hurry to get the episode out here, and grabbed the wrong video from my DVR, and deleted all the others I had - I tried to delete this, so it wasn't listed, but it's still here o_O"
,zappa1969,2012-06-16T18:12Z,"The guy made a mistake, why don't you try being more appreciative You guys are DICKS!!"
,CptWacko,2012-06-16T22:39Z,"This torrrent IS FAKE, he said he made a mistake but never corrected it. It's a nerd TV show with a gay superhero that as rainbow wings.

...it sucks because I thought that users with a pirate logo were all legit."
[T],relentlesstech,2012-06-17T01:43Z,"Jesus, people are impatient! I said I was going to fix it, and I had to wait for it to be on again to re-rip it - I've got one hell of a good rep here, but because of ONE fuck-up, people have to talk shit? You can't wait a little longer for FREE SHIT ???

Here's the RIGHT file:

,CptWacko,2012-06-17T06:42Z,"I didn't mean to offend you. I was just stating a fact, thanks for the other torrent but this one should be deleted permanently."
,CptWacko,2012-06-17T09:18Z,He corrected is mistake and is legit!
[T],relentlesstech,2012-06-17T15:42Z,Why won't this DELETE ?!?!?!?!?!? o_O
,Diax88,2012-06-17T19:14Z,"No worries man....

Thanks for all the hard work you do!"
