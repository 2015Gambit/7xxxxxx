,dorianre,2012-06-16T15:01Z,Why I cant download it?It says pending!Is it because I am outside US?
,lucyfan98,2012-06-16T21:50Z,"If you are using UTorrent to download it, then right click on the torrent and choose force start. That should make it work. If not, maybe you should restart your program or reinstall it. "
,dorianre,2012-06-16T23:44Z,yes but i dont have problem downloading other torrents only this one!and I have choose force start but it does not download
,tittopi,2012-06-17T16:43Z,"Yep TvTeam uploads are fucked up today 

personally i prefer torrents but you can find this upload in http://www.rlsbb.com"
,APAULCOLYPSE,2012-06-17T19:12Z,"Yep.. Something is up with this torrent.. On TORRENTZ it still says pending.. 

I thought PirateBay was better than this.. 

I'm actually trying that RLS website TITTO posted and it says about 30 minutes left.. so I'm having my fingers crossed that it's not some virus.. "
,APAULCOLYPSE,2012-06-17T20:45Z,"Yep, it worked.. if you dont want to wait till this to work go to that link and search at the top.. 

Or you can go on the Fox website in about a week and stream through there.. "
