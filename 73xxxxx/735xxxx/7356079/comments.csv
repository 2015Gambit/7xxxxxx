,T.F.K,2012-06-15T16:11Z,GUYS COMMENT if working!!!!!
,xpmule,2012-06-15T16:40Z,"this looks exactly like some other weird torrents i've seen on TPB lately..

Based on what the files look like i would have to say NO bloody way is this from Skidrow.

Wouldn't touch this..
Seems fishy to me"
,xpmule,2012-06-15T16:43Z,"look at this torrent called ""Game""
that was added to the software section the other day..

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7350575/Game#filelistContainer

notice the similarities in file types and names

someone is lurking around up to something i think"
,T.F.K,2012-06-15T16:44Z,"if SKIDROW paste this on the website,its not joke or fake,try guys,we dont upload fake things,you dont have anything to lose."
,ImSoJaded,2012-06-15T16:45Z,"Might be a legit non-scene attempt at making a server emulator, but slapping the SKIDROW tag on it is a bad move. Trying to use a recognized group's name to ride into fame makes even a legit attempt suspicious looking."
,sellivan25,2012-06-15T16:51Z,it is on skidrows website... seems legit
,supersonic5000,2012-06-15T17:19Z,its working but cant complete the first quest or go inside somewhere.. :( is this an error ?
,supersonic5000,2012-06-15T17:58Z,just for me dont woking quests????
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-06-15T18:22Z,did anyone even try it yet? doesnt seem like it.... i dont even have the game downloaded cuz im waiting for one of these that works with very few bugs....or no bugs at all.
,Xes69,2012-06-15T18:30Z,"Skidrow has no a website, like any others scene groups."
,Lefty85,2012-06-15T18:48Z,its not from SKIDROW....just check orlydb you can see there what has been released and what not...
,Lefty85,2012-06-15T18:49Z,but that emulator stuff works so far...still has bugs though
,Calvincius,2012-06-15T18:59Z,"@FuCtUpPuNk
Agreed !

Hey Guys wait for a skull, that's it !"
,T.F.K,2012-06-15T19:13Z,"PEOPLE is LEGIT,i upload only real things!!!!"
,sweeem,2012-06-15T19:46Z,"@Calvincius

HeroMaster has a skull and he uploaded working emulator."
,GObonzo,2012-06-15T20:19Z,"not SKIDROW. copy of MADCOW mooege server emulator with other garbage added in.
you know if someone creates a site and names it SKIDROW anything they write there MUST BE TRUE! no one on the internet would ever try to scam anyone would they?"
,Ylts,2012-06-15T20:29Z,"geez... skidrow took madcow's d3 beta emulator and made work with retail version. 
so its they both released the emulator..."
,rica5mend,2012-06-15T20:36Z,skulls are the only ones than can be trusted 
,Calvincius,2012-06-15T20:47Z,"@T.F.K

Yeh i know about you T.F.K, i ve seen some of yours recent releases, i know you 're not pranking with folks, but as FuCtUpPuNk said, it's better to wait for a fully fonctional crack without annoying bugs, working at its 100% not something like 30 % or less. 
@sweeem

Yeh i know it mate, but i'll prefer to wait for an entire release with a 100 % fonctional crack within. 

BTW thanks to both of you."
,T.F.K,2012-06-15T20:55Z,"I install now because of you,to see if it works,and WORKS! i dont know ,why you blame somebody,with out arguments..."
,dfry411,2012-06-15T21:13Z,v2 with lan already out
,NexiumCore,2012-06-15T21:32Z,"This is definitely from skidrow, I saw it a few minutes ago on their site."
,Castlemania,2012-06-15T21:45Z,"forestg26p

im gonna say to you what i said in your last comment.

post links that lead to ad's if you love men"
,helppleasehelp,2012-06-15T21:48Z,"What? Only now are you testing to see if you're own upload actually works? And you wonder why no one trusts you?

You only upload ""real stuff"" yet this up load that you are only now testing is what your 3rd upload?
What a track record you're got. Did you even test you other 2 uploads? Or did you blindly upload them, too?"
,kely88,2012-06-15T22:43Z,"OMG noobs! SKIDROW dont have a website, those sites u r mentioning are not created and ran by skidrow! I fucking cant believe why ppl cant understand it..."
,dfry411,2012-06-15T22:52Z,"i downloaded this straght from skidrow site and followed all steps and PRESTO. working, with bugs though. "
,Nekuv15,2012-06-15T23:00Z,Well i tried this out and i was able to play. well not really. Its broken as hell due to it needing access to Blizzards files and without those half the game is broken. it works it just shitty
,axinte,2012-06-15T23:30Z,"I got tired of waiting and dlding fake cracks so I choosed to play something free.

 I found http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbddjhjecajxccieejjfcxigjgcbxibgxbgdhxbaa and cooled my thirst of hacking monsters.

You can try too. It's free... but addictive :)"
,Castlemania,2012-06-16T01:57Z,"@axinte

,mateus1500,2012-06-16T06:33Z,"I played and this method really work... but there is some bugs ocurring during the quests, the quests don't happen... so you can play Diablo 3, but the quests don't work, i can't believe in this sh*t!"

,nowandever29tpb,2012-06-19T04:28Z,"Sadly, this contains multiple viruses (virii?).  The setup.exe is clean, but the BIN files contain encrypted viruses.  Norton Internet Security 2012 caught them as they were being extracted, thankfully.  A virus scan will not detect anything, until you run setup.exe, then, if your AV is good enough, you will see the viruses in the files."
