An arcade-style dungeon-crawler: Choose your champion and begin your quest!
Guide a fighter, a wizard, or a thief deep into a hostile dungeon to wrest the town of Hallemot from the clutches of the tyrannical minotaur Asterion. Engaging, thought-provoking gameplay that's different every time, but fast enough to take in bite-sized chunks.
Tap or hold to move; move into enemies to engage them in melee, or tap spells to cast them. Tap your character's portrait to view your current stats, and even though character death is permanent, it's also half the fun!
