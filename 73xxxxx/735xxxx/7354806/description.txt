 ΓÇ║   Directed by          He Jianjun                                    
      

      Plot:

      All over China, in the city and the countryside, you can find illegal 
      DVDs and video cassettes of well-known Western feature films. People 
      acquire their knowledge of films from these pirate versions and so 
      far there hasn't been a single feature film to focus on this 
      phenomenon. He Jianjun, best known for his unusual narrative technique 
      and calm, atmospherically lit feature films about contemporary Chinese 
      life, here skilfully uses the DV camera. The stories are set during a 
      cold winter in Beijing. The people selling illegal DVDs are everywhere: 
      in shopping centres, on viaducts, around the bars and at the university.


      The film follows a variety of characters related to their favourite 
      films. After leaving university, Shen Ming lives on a menu of DVDs. 
      He meets the pretty yet indifferent Mei Xiaojing, who wants to throw 
      all her inhibitions overboard a la Almodovar. We see a drummer who 
      lives alone and became HIV positive after a medical error. Seeing
      A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT makes him move to the infinity and peace of 
      the coast. An unemployed couple uses violent films (such as PULP 
      FICTION) to express their frustrations. But when they set out with 
      fake guns to commit a robbery, they are disenchanted. The illegal 
      DVDs, it becomes apparent, open up a road to a new and unknown world 
      for the characters, one that is even able to change their lives.
