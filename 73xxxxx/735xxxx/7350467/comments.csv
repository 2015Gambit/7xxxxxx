Open Installous on your phone and install."

,btnhsnhh,2012-08-08T07:45Z,"to install on your device you need to bypass the code signature each app has. 
Jailbreak device  (modmyi.com/jailbreak/)
Add new source   (Cydia - Manage - Sources - Add)
                      cydia.hackulo.us/
Search for   AppSync
Choose the app that corresponds with your device ios. 
this only allows to sync cracked apps (like this) from itunes. "
