This is a four track album released in 1995 by the then three remaining Beatles. The title track was incomplete at the time of John Lennon's death and was completed in the studio my McCartney, Harrison, and Ringo. There is an extensive Wikipedia page with information about the album, just check it out for more info. I included a high resolution image of the album cover art in the folder. All tracks are 320kbps mp3. Enjoy.
