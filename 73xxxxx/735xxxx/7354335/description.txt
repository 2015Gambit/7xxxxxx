Industrial black metal is a style of music derived from a blending of black metal and various types of electronic music including industrial itself at times, near-completely devoid of it most of the time. The style was pioneered in the late 90s by bands like Mysticum and Helheim. Riffs often contain a very sharp guitar tone and often incorporate tight, ΓÇ£mechanicalΓÇ¥ playing in a black metal style. Themes have ranged from Satan to fascism and martial ideals to hard drug abuse and insanity. Many styles of electronics have been blended with black metal over time, creating a genre that is vast in experimentation and always expanding further.
