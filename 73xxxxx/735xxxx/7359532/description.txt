Mark Vernon takes his inspiration from 42 of the funniest, wisest, and quirkiest quotations about the big questions in life, and uses these as starting points for his brilliant observations. In each chapter he explains what the greatest thinkers of all time have had to say on subjects such as eternal life, work, love and sex, and the nature of happiness; he draws his own conclusions, and will provoke you to think deeply yourself!
