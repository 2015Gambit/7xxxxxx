On 2010's Palomino, Trampled by Turtles was nearly breathless. A punk and bluegrass mix, the Duluth, Minn., quintet's acoustic thrash established it as a must-see live act. Stars and Satellites possesses moments when the band seems to be in overdrive, but overall it's much more introspective. A current touchstone would be the Avett Brothers, another act known for its raucous moments that moved toward singer-songwriter fare. Frontman Dave Simonett here remains a talent when it comes to composing, and the band's ability to pound acoustically is beyond question. The quiet solitude of "Alone" and mournful "The Calm and the Crying Wind" wear their emotions on their titles, but they would've been rare on previous Turtles LPs. Brawny instrumental "Risk" capably displays the band's progressive bluegrass side. As a whole, Stars and Satellites is full of wonder
