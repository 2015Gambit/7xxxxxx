,Bubbers83,2012-06-14T19:50Z,"Wow, this new 52 truly is a return to pre-crisis continuity. The return of Thomas Wayne Jr?. I hate to say it but i'm sensing another Crisis 10 years or so down the line."
,Bubbers83,2012-06-14T19:55Z,"not to mention..when they redid owlman as coming from antimatter universe..he was thomas wayne jr, bruces brother. I thought the whole point of this new 52 was for new ideas, not to rehash old ones? course should have seen this coming with the whole OWL concept."
