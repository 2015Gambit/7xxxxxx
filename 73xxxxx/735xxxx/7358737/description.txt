
The 2006 Radio Sessions is a mp3 (320kbps) collection of radio performances Reznor and Murphy had done during the tour that features the band TV on the Radio and members and associates of NIN. Featuring new reinterpretations of songs by NIN, Bauhaus, and Peter Murphy's solo work plus tracks by TV on the Radio, Pere Ubu, Iggy Pop, the Normal, and Joy Division. Performed live with a small audience for each track, the songs reveal an intimacy and feel of two artists playing songs to reveal their influences and their acknowledgment of each one. Though so far, it's an incomplete collection, it remains to be one of the legendary and inspiring work that Trent Reznor and Peter Murphy has done in their great, respective careers.
