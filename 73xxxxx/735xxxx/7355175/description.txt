I am a bit of a mono fanatic and it is because of this that I have created this torrent. In this torrent you will find the complete Bob Dylan mono box set entitled "Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings" that was released in 2010. Below is a list of all the albums included.

Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings Box Set...

- Bob Dylan, 1962
- The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, 1963
- Another Side of Bob Dylan, 1964
- Times They Are A-Changin', 1964
- Bringing It All Back Home, 1965
- Highway 61 Revisited, 1965
- Blonde on Blonde, 1966
- John Wesley Harding, 1967


ALSO, this torrent includes ALL of the above albums in STEREO format, as well as Nashville Skyline (1969) and New Morning (1970). Nashville Skyline and New Morning weren't recorded in mono and therefore were not included as part of the mono box set. As always, I have included a folder entitled "COVER ART" with high resolution album covers for each of the albums. You will find that all of the tracks are iTunes friendly and have been assigned the proper disc number, track number, song title, etc., tags necessary to sort them neatly in your iTunes library.
