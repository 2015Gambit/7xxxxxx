Soundtrack for the 1993 movie 'My Life' by John Barry (who also did the scores for 'Somewhere in Time', 'Dances with Wolves', and many others).

Very nice orchestral music, in my opinion.

The Torrent contains both a .FLAC (ripped via Songbird) and .MP3 (where all the ID3 tags are written with album art).

Please make sure to seed to a minimum of 100%, as always.
