Register V-Ray menus

Install WIBU key drivers
Register the Vray license service

I'm afraid that I do something wrong in the start and Vray doesn't install right. I have 3ds Max 2013.

Thanks!"

,mupelo,2012-08-15T10:40Z,"Are you sure?

Could you SomeRain please comment this and my last questions?"
,ZombiKemist,2012-08-27T19:05Z,"I have this working just fine for 2013. When installing:

Install workstation

Local V-Ray license

you can leave Register V-Ray Menus checked

uncheck Install WIBU key drivers and Register V-Ray license service

Make sure you copy over the dll's from crack to your 3ds max folder after."
