not really fair to the groups and confusing to people downloading
considering there is always numerous releases scene + p2p releases

""blank""

FQM
proudly presents"
[T],trialNerror,2012-06-13T12:12Z,"it's not right you folks thank sceneline, ettv, eztv, and all those names but you never thank the ones who actually make the rips.

thank FQM, LOL, ASAP, KILLERS, and all the other groups that actually do the work.

all those other names like ettv, sceneline, eztv - they don't do a damn thing - they're just middlemen. "

Found this one first regardless of who got it off TV.
:P

I use to thank you, tNe, but you went away."
,xpmule,2012-06-20T19:05Z,"i think made my point..

and i thank people profusely so don't start with that crap..

credit where its due..

If a scene group made the release
add the damn name to your torrent titles
and
descriptions

why is that too much too ask for ?

There is private trackers i belong to that would not tolerate half the bs
that goes on around here.."
