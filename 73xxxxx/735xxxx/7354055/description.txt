Learn to build human-interactive Android apps, starting with device sensors

This book shows Android developers how to exploit the rich set of device sensorsΓÇölocational, physical (temperature, pressure, light, acceleration, etc.), cameras, microphones, and speech recognitionΓÇöin order to build fully human-interactive Android applications. Whether providing hands-free directions or checking your blood pressure, Professional Android Sensor Programming shows how to turn possibility into reality.

The authors provide techniques that bridge the gap between accessing sensors and putting them to meaningful use in real-world situations. They not only show you how to use the sensor related APIs effectively, they also describe how to use supporting Android OS components to build complete systems. Along the way, they provide solutions to problems that commonly occur when using Android's sensors, with tested, real-world examples. Ultimately, this invaluable resource provides in-depth, runnable code examples that you can then adapt for your own applications.
