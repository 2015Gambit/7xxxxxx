Tais toi ! "
[V],dynstab2,2012-06-24T11:28Z,"Actually it's ""Tais-toi!"". French requires a hyphen be used in an imperative pronominal form. What carries the same message, in a more convincing way, without the use of a hyphen is ""Ta yeule!"" meaning ""Ta gueule!"" (""Shut up!"") in a French-Canadian dialect called Joual, a dialect spoken notably by Jack Kerouac."
