I'm working with 500kbps upload speed so I'm doing all I can from my end. PLEASE seed this for at least an hour once you finish downloading."

,NCC86,2012-06-18T08:51Z,Thank you for your kind words and enthusiasm. I hope you enjoy these. Share them with someone younger than yourself and keep The Beatles' music alive...(not that they need our help).
