This is a bootleg pack that I compiled from my own collection. It includes:



- Unsurpassed Masters (Complete Yellow Dog Set), Vol. 1-7
- Hollywood Bowl Complete (Yellow Dog, 1993)
- Stars of '63 (Swingin' Pig, (1988)
- The Black Album (1983)
- The Original Decca Tapes & Cavern Club Rehearsals (1991)
- The Star-Club Tapes (2006)
- Unplugged (1995)
- PLUS 191 rare, unknown, and unlabeled tracks from my own collection.


Everything in here is 320kbps mp3 except for The Black Album, Unplugged, and most of the 191 rare, unknown and unlabeled tracks from my own collection. If you need more information on the background and origin of these bootlegs i recommend searching for them at BootlegZone or just a quick Google search. FYI, the "Unplugged" album is basically a reduction of the Kinfaun Sessions bootleg that was released a few years prior. As for the 191 rare tracks, I have absolutely no idea as to the origin of the recordings, I downloaded them from a guy that has been collecting rare Beatles songs for years and he also had no info on them. It would be admirable if anyone took the time to piece them together into coherent albums and collections and re-upload them with the puzzle complete. Also, I know how hard it can be to find accurate album covers for bootlegs so I have included a folder with high resolution album art for all of these albums. I hope you all enjoy them.
