,Flyer_10,2012-06-16T19:17Z,This has got descriptive audio commentary which is really annoying. Hopefully a proper is released soon. So has the .mp4 file of the same ep.
[V],psspss,2012-06-17T03:24Z,"No other copy all will have the same audio
UK rippers,.

they reason they enabled it.. so the foreign parts
with subtitles are read out..

which is good I think.. cant stand havign to read stuff voice over is way better

its only a few times on the first story which was boring

the second story is way better and i didnt notce any annoying voice overs in that one.. maybe 2 times in quiet parts"
