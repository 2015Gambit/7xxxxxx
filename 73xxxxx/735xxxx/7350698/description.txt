This is an all around great album. By this time of night I'm a little too drunk to do any serious analyzation of any music but I will tell you this: Download the Demon Days! Ones of my favorite albums of all time and the reason I respect Danger Mouse so much as a producer. This is a must hear. And in lossless FLAC!? My god! Sweet Jesus! Get it now!

Shit this is from 2005!? That's older than I thought! Anyway, I still play this album regularly and it's great. Totally different than the first gorillaz album (not that I didn't like that one too) - all the tracks flow smoothly into the next and its completely beautiful. I forgot to make a log file for this one but its ripped with EAC 0.99 and checked with AccurateRip. Tracks 2, 6, and 7 had "suspicious positions" but I have played through them personally and didn't notice anything different from what I normally hear with the CD in the CD player.

Congratulations on your download! Support the artists!
