(1987) Also known as "Dinosaurs: A Fun Filled Trip Back in Time"

It's the second half that you remember!  Begins with a dull boy-tries-to-get-good-science-paper-idea story (starring very young Fred Savage) until about 13:20 mark, when it morphs into FANTASTIC "claymation" video created (in 1980) by Will Vinton.
