,tbp_Out,2012-06-16T22:37Z,Just wondering will this unlock Encore as well or do we have to do the .dll trick?
,tbp_Out,2012-06-16T22:37Z,"Oh, never mind. I just caught the line about it may or may not work."
[H],tykoon123,2012-06-16T22:41Z,"If you have problem in running the application, try this:

1. Open Photoshop (or any other desired program in the collection) -- you need to initiate the trial version

2. Open the folder ""Milkman -- PatcherFiles"" that was included in the download

3. RENAME THE FILE to amtlib.dll --- as soon as this is done, you COPY this file

4. After you COPY the amtlib.dll file, you must paste this in all the respective folders (now this will take some digging, thankfully it's damn near impossible to mess this up)

All you have to do is find the location the program is downloaded. For myself, it was in C:Program Files (x86)

After you find the location of all the Adobe products, open each folder respectively, starting with the top of the list is much easier, so you don't forget or repeat

All I did for the AdobeAcrobat was copied the other file in there, the one pertaining to adobeacrobat, and did the same as with the other file, only this file was only copied in to the AdobeAcrobat folder, as it was not necessary anywhere else

Just simply CTRL V (paste) in to all the folders, REPLACE this file.... Once you have replaced this file, the program should run uninterrupted without prompting you that your trial period will expire or asking you to purchase the software"

Sorry, but it is bit slow. It gives me 0.5-0.1 speed. I have already installed Suite CS6 as trail. Need crack only......"
,namfaceguy,2012-06-18T05:38Z,"It would be very helpful if you released a crack only version as people can download the trial very quickly from adobe.  Also can you confirm that premiere has all the presets available?  This is rarely addressed and needs to be.  Premiere may seem to ""work"" but when you actually use it there are many features disabled and many presets missing.  Thank you for the torrent."
,iFROSTBITE,2012-06-19T19:09Z,Thnxs for the file bro but dam is it ever slow -._.-
,KittenKiller,2012-06-20T22:30Z,"@tykoon123: 
""3. RENAME THE FILE to amtlib.dll --- as soon as this is done, you COPY this file""

There are 5 files in the MilkmanPatcherFiles folder, 3 of which are DLL's. Are you saying to rename amtlib32bit.dll AND amtlib64bit.dll to just amtlib.dll before placing them in their respective folders?

Keep up the good work ;)"
,Tinggaard,2012-06-21T05:24Z,"I've tried 5 different malware/virus/trojan scanners, ALL of them wants to block the ""Adobe"" bootstrapper.

Since i lost my Steam account and FB started throwing out spamlinks in my name, I'd say this torrent is tainted..."
,Xeneron,2012-06-23T15:52Z,"Cool torrent, downloaded it and installed it very fast going to send as much as I can.
Everything works, exept for Encore and Acrobat X, but there is no problems like in the other torrents with programs like Premiere and After Effects that they stop working saying the serial or license is expired.
And NO there is no Trojan inside this torrent, people really should google what's a false positive, if you're having trouble just shut down your AV or Malware program for a while and reactivate after everything is done."
,raze18,2012-06-27T16:14Z,I get the error when extracting: Total patch and file name must not exceed 260 characters. How do I extract this
,God_Am,2012-06-29T13:28Z,"Does Premiere comes with all its presets? I hope it does. Other torrents came with none. If anyone can answer this, I'd really appreciate it. "
,jujujunk,2012-07-02T04:14Z,After Effects standard plugins are missing :(
,iamiansteven,2012-07-21T06:36Z,"I cannot activate Encore CS6
I tried the both of dll (64, 32)
But it says that I need a serial that has royalty bearing serial number. HELP PLEASE"
