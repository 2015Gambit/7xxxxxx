,kangminwoo17,2012-06-16T17:26Z,OK be aware that some of you will not work and I am not 100% sure every one is working so don't put bad comments because I will try to fix or get a solution for you as fast as I can !
,asinencia,2012-06-16T17:43Z,Quick question: is this the Feral Interactive version or a cider port?
,nightwingdick,2012-06-16T18:02Z,this is probable a cider port as the feral interactive version has not yet been released (to my knowledge)
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-16T18:09Z,Yes This is a Cider (Sorry for a Late comment) and this also works well in Macbook whites (mine) and known issues are some times it may stuck on the loading screen but not a lot.... (only like 2/10 for me ) and I will upload the feral interactive version as soon as possible it releases !
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-16T18:09Z,If it gets stuck then restart your ETW.
,asinencia,2012-06-16T18:12Z,"Yeah, that was my suspicion. I'll have a look once it's finished, worth downloading anyway."
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-16T18:22Z,guys do you know this issue I can't actually view all the comments please help...
,Freakando,2012-06-16T23:02Z,"Hey! When i click the app. the game gets stuck on the initial screen where it says all about all rights reserved... .. ... 

Do you know how i could fix it?? 

Thanks for the help!!"
,paulski4,2012-06-17T01:49Z,"what language is this, how do i make it into english"
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T02:21Z,it is a ported version so you can actually download a crack from gamcopyworld or other places and also you can try to restart your ETW or your computer I tried that too and it worked for me so good luck with that !
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T02:23Z,also I said this as bugs because it is a ported version so I will give you a fix as fast as I can but for the loading screen issue you can actually download the crack or restart stuff.
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T02:25Z,just put all the bugs on the comments I will fix it one by one.
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T02:28Z,For language you can download the English crack or you can press the setting try to press all the buttons on settings and if it goes to the language settings press english (it ls like  in the last or so so try that)
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T02:37Z,Oh I forgot to mention this.... THIS ONLY WORKS FOR NIVIDIA CARDS AND AMD CARDS NOT INTEL !! SO SORRY FOR INTEL USERS !

,paulski4,2012-06-17T03:20Z,"i can not seem to change the language to english, can someone direct me please?"
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T03:23Z,Download a Language Pack 
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T03:27Z,Language packs just pop up when you google it

,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T06:54Z,link to language pack (english) http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6240171/Empire__Total_War_English_lan
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T06:54Z,put it in the Data folder and erase the russian ones

,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T08:22Z,guys does it work now?
,BMXS,2012-06-17T08:25Z,dam its too slow
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T08:27Z,I wish it worked but the lang pack download is to slow so every one seed if you guys want the file faster.
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T08:32Z,ok?
,blaspemois,2012-06-17T10:11Z,when replacing the russian language pack with the english the game wont even start
,Freakando,2012-06-17T11:34Z,"@blaspemois 
have the same problem as me... the game only open the ""all rights reserved"" screen and then it close for no reason... "
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T13:21Z,"I want to say that you need to put BOTH RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE PACK and open LANGUAGE.TXT  and PUT EN then save close and OPEN THEN IT WILL WORK 


THE STUCK ON RIGHTS RESERVED SCREEN IS BASIC THIS GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT INTEL !! THIS ONLY WORKS IN NIVIDIA GRAPHICS OR AMD GRAPHICS ESPECIALLY ON MAC !!! 

did this help?"
,kangminwoo17,2012-06-17T13:22Z,I also want to say don't erase RU in Language.TXT
,Freakando,2012-06-17T14:06Z,"em.. actually it didn't work... 

now there is anything written... in the main menu, and not even in the game itself...."
,blaspemois,2012-06-17T14:59Z,"Just like Freakando, no text at all in the whole game"
,blaspemois,2012-06-17T15:14Z,No texts in the game after instructions
,paulski4,2012-06-17T16:21Z,yeah i did that too and now there is no text.
,bloodysliver,2012-06-18T01:12Z,"Same problem, no text when you add the English language packs and change the language.txt

Please be specific with instructions, here's what I attempted.

-Mounted ETW.dmg (by double clicking)
-Dragged program into Applications folder
-Downloaded english language packs
-Moved them into the same folder as the RU language packs
-Opened Language.txt in the same folder and added EN (tried several combinations, added before and after, etc.)
-When I open the game after a long time loading the menus have no text anymore

Even if I change everything back, the text doesn't reappear, not even the Russian

If I don't add the language packs there is text in Russian

Changing resolution made no difference (haven't tried changing any other settings since I can't read the menus)"
,BMXS,2012-06-18T06:09Z,"works for me 
and its fine only the problem is the language"
,BMXS,2012-06-18T09:33Z,kangminwoo17 can u re upload it pls in ENG!!!! ok 
,paulski4,2012-06-18T17:33Z,yeah if it works for kangminwoo17 in english it would be very easy for everybody if you reuploaded in english
,mightyhealthy,2012-06-18T20:43Z,"I'm on a MBP with Lion and Intel Card... IT WORKS!
I do have the same language problem as everybody else: no text when I add the pack; game doesn't start if I erase the russian files. Other than that, it seems to run fine. I haven't been able to adjust the settings for performance because I can't read russian.. I'm seeding, but please find a fix soon, or it's not worth it anymore. "
,ferdinandmuncherman,2012-06-19T22:20Z,"As soon as this is fixed/reuploaded so the text works in english, I will download and seed but at the moment it is unplayable."
,BMXS,2012-06-20T17:40Z,pls re upload it !!
,welderch,2012-06-21T18:17Z,If your mac is more than 4 to 5 years old don't try pretty sure its Intel only need at least Intel core 5  most likely 4 GHz not sure exactly just guessing as im still power pc 
,bloodylord,2012-06-24T15:10Z,"Hey dudes, does it work now?
I've bought this game on my PC a long time ago, but now that i'm on my mac (for 1,5 years) i've not been able to play it for a while!
Thanks!"
,skyliner0121,2012-06-24T21:53Z,"I'm kind of disappointed in this. I tried several different things to get the language to work in english, but nothing I do works. I'm also kind of disappointed that kangminwoo17 hasn't responded back on here telling us how to get it to work... this isn't worth it until it works in english so don't bother."
,bloodylord,2012-06-25T00:28Z,"Oh manâ&#x20AC;Ś I'm actually at 99% of downloading. Please author, help us!"
,Reviglote,2012-06-25T15:21Z,"Hey,


 I tried many way of making this game run, but it don't (it stays stuck to the rights reserved page)
 I'm looking for a crack, can you show us a good one ?"
,bloodylord,2012-06-25T16:27Z,"For me it stays on the rights page for a while, 5 minutes or more. Just try to wait a bit"
,Reviglote,2012-06-25T17:59Z,"Yes, it's lunched after a while ! thx

 But there is still the language issue... too bad."
,malthus0,2012-06-25T19:27Z,hi
,bloodylord,2012-06-25T22:42Z,"For those who want to play some random games, i've clicked everywhere, and for skirmish it's:
Menu: the second button (single player)
Single player menu: the last button.
Then watch the images to see if it's ground, naval or siege battle. Hope it helps for now
I've been able to play several games like that, but not to modify options (graphics for instance)
and game options..."
,malthus0,2012-06-26T02:51Z,The feral version should be out in the next weeks anyway
,bloodylord,2012-06-26T20:02Z,"I'm really looking forward to this, in order to use my legal cd-key!
Where did you see that please?"
,bloodylord,2012-06-26T20:51Z,"On Feral's website, i've read that you need Mac OS X 10.7.3 as a minimal configâ&#x20AC;Ś
No way, if i download this, i 'll never be able to play my other games..."
,Vaisya,2012-06-29T13:18Z,"After Two week download, i finally can start learn Russian, PLEASE did someone can put a Holy Link for translate that in ENGLISH . !!"
,bloodylord,2012-07-01T12:07Z,+1 I'd like to play on campaign mode. I'm bored with playing random games without changing any options...
,Vaisya,2012-07-02T01:46Z,"is there this game called Cruder kings II did someone is able to crack a mac version, can be more useful than a russian game"
,kike0710,2012-08-06T20:50Z,how did i put the english  languaje in the game???
,bloodysliver,2012-08-09T00:36Z,"Again, this game is not in english.
Don't waste your time if you don't know Russian"
,Aquillum,2012-09-20T16:38Z,The Feral version is out now. Could you please try cracking that and setting up a torrent for it plz. Ty.
