,rikas123,2012-07-22T08:05Z,"Hey guys i found out where those files in fix for world tour should be.
1.fifazf.self: you need to go to PS3_GAME -> USDIR scroll down and you will find it.
2.FootballCompEngzf.sprx: you do the same PS3_GAME -> USDIR croll down you will find folder dlc. Then go dlc -> dlc_FotballCompEng -> dlc -> FotballCompEng -> and there you will find the only file FotballCompEngzf.sprx. "
,vaporixm,2012-08-03T05:32Z,"how do i do this :
2. Transfer the eboot in the ""Crack"" folder onto a usb and install the content to your ps3.

can i just copy and overwrite the cracked eboot file before transferring the game over to my ext HDD?

I did the above and still get prompted to update my system firmware in order to play the game.
currently on 3.41 ps3break dongle."
