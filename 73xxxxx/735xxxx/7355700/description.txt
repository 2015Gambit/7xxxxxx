This is the new Fifa Street 2012 not Fifa Street 3!!!

I have put together:

FIFA.Street.PS3-DUPLEX

and E3 Team┬┤s fix for 3.55/3.41 (and the new fix).

Big thanks to Duplex and the E3 Team!!!

The main reason I did this, was because I was starting to getting tired of downloading the game from different sites like Rapidshare in parts. It take a couple of days before I could finally get it. But now I┬┤m making it easier for you. ;)



----Installation----

1. Start by moving the "BLES01493-[FIFA Street]" folder onto your ps3's harddrive or just into a external harddrive.
2. Transfer the eboot in the "Crack" folder onto a usb and install the content to your ps3.
3. Start the game.

Ps. The game will work, but not the world tour.

To fix this your have to transfer the files in your "fix for world tour" folder. I don┬┤t really know how to handle 
these files yet, but as soon as I come home to my ps3 I will try to figur out how to do it. Meanwhile you can play
games againts your friend/computer.

If someone know how you handle the files within the "fix for world tour" folder, please post a guide how (in the comments).

Anyway, it probably come out a new better fix soon. ;)

Sincerely, somebody that you used to know.
