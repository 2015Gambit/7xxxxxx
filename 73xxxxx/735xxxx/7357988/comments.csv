This torrent is useless."

Many , like me, don't have the steam version , and while i searched (and noticed your post at http://community.gaslampgames.com/threads/yhtntep-without-steam.3571/) i couldn't make your dlc work. It says that some file is missing. This is a complete packed version of the game, so until someone puts a complete packed version of 1.0.11 (with both expansions) i wouldn't say its useless."

Enjoy in the meantime."
