,clikaroo,2012-06-14T12:01Z,"I'm downloading, so once it's being seeded n I can get it I'll leave it up for a week at least. This show owns Ghost Hunters IMO. 

Also just putting it out here for TVTeam, psspss, ettv, trialnerror, sceneline, et al., Destination Truth is coming back in July... I really hope one of you uploads that joint here. I'll be a dedicated seeder for all that nonsense. Josh cracks me up. :()"
[T],trialNerror,2012-06-14T12:57Z,"helping seed as well.

who the fetch put that dexter bdrip ep in the mix?

@ clikaroo - tvteam, sceneline, eztv, et al of those are automatic accounts and don't read comments. nor do they do any recording or converting. they only relay the torrents.

if you know where my paranormal tv show blogspot is at you can visit there; Destination Truth is marked on the calendar and after season 5 starts the folks visiting the blog will most likely provide links for direct downloads and/or torrents for the series.

i may even sneak out a release if nothing else is around, but if i see that release circulate on other sites the party will stop and you folks will have to wait until something else pops up."
,iamsith,2012-06-14T13:33Z,yo i just realized this file is full of rars... whats up with that?
[V],sceneline,2012-06-14T14:58Z,"We read the comment and we upload here, until now i was thinking i'm human not a software :)
we upload alot thats why some poeple think we don't read we can't answer all comments, "
[T],trialNerror,2012-06-14T15:44Z,"sacred feces! sceneline is human! lol 

sorry about that. didn't realize there was a physical being behind sceneline. the other sites i hang out at generally have automated uploads from those that spread the scene releases. thank you for proving me wrong. i do enjoy learning something new. :) cheers!

but you have to admit you can't do anything about requests.  you can only share that which is available. if it wasn't done by a group or some p2p user, it isn't available. period."
