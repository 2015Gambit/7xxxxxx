The solo drumming on this disc is an outstanding example of impeccable, uninterrupted shamanic journey drumming in the classic mode by Michael Harner, internationally recognized teacher and practitioner of shamanism. His large, single head, round frame, hand drum produces the full range of the auditory spectrum, from pulsing low frequency throb to the subtle midrange nuances and high frequency overtones. The double drumming, which some journeyers prefer, is Laos done by Michael Harner, assisted by David Corbin. Both are using single head, round frame drums. The drums are beaten facing each other at a slight angle, about four feet apart, to produce the maximum effect without excessive reverberation. This is not music, but is to be used as instructed in Michael Harner's book, The Way of the Shaman.
