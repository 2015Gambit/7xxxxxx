[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-18T14:52Z,"thanks, saves us DRM removing time (figured out how to record nat geo shows w/o drm, still need to record 50 hours of shows with drm tho...lol)"
[V],psspss,2012-06-19T13:58Z,"did you google
removing drm from pvr

there many forums on it.

can you play to laptop screen at all?

if so.. ScreenVirtuoso PRO will do the jobn nicely

even on a i3

but leave audio on pcm and convert that
separtely to mp3 using avidemux.org
leave video on copy

it will even make the xvid on the fly"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-20T14:39Z,"Nah it's not a PVR. It's a USB TV Tuner hooked up to Windows Media Centre.

Beyond TV doesn't record with DRM on TruTV, Nat Geo, and TeenNick shows. :)"
