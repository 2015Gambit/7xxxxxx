,BKKJack,2012-06-14T15:04Z,"There's been about 8 of these gone up today. 

Is there a war of the ""Release Group"" douchebags going on?"
,AgentClaret,2012-06-14T18:52Z,"Haha @ BKKJack, so true!

Check out Tykoons. He's the only one of those that have gone up today that's not a complete spammer.

Guess that green skull doesn't mean much now, huh? "
[T],Knaster,2012-06-14T20:01Z,"No that green skull means shit nowadays since people say ""oooh cool u uploaded that u deserve a green skull man""

When alot of good people that has been uploading for years get about zero appreciation. So yeah green skull does not always mean ""Trustworthy""....."
[V],scene4all,2012-06-14T20:46Z,"@AgentClaret lol Tykoons upload is the same thing, see the filesize? check UNiQUE's and his so called ""XTREME"" file with media-info and you will see they are both the same. lol re-tagging and taking credit for someone else work doesn't change the fact that its still the same thing."
