Kendra on Top will chronicle Kendra Wilkinson’s journey as she takes control of her new identity. Known for being the outrageous, bodacious, sex symbol who once dated Hugh Hefner, she is now a loving mom to son Hank IV (“Little Hank”) and wife to former NFL player Hank Baskett III. She’s also on a mission to prove that she can be a mommy and still be a hottie. Along the way, she’s pulled in many directions but faces each challenge and opportunity with an upbeat attitude and an outrageously funny outlook on life. Meanwhile, Hank is on his own journey to discover what life is like outside of the NFL. And, if that’s not enough, there’s talk of baby number two! (Source: WE)
