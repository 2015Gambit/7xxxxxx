Note: jus a straight forward reencode of the
26K release jus did my usual cleaning of sat
denoisers, smoothers, gamma, colour, contrast,
brightness, etc slight change in AR aswell der
is tipical cam issues like movement witch causes
boarders plus abit of a focus issue here nd there
no biggie chopped the last 40mins off so i could
encode that different seems it still had annoying
boarders there, plus HC subs thought-out witch is
abit annoying not gona lie but A, HOPE you Enjoy

Note2: chopped it at the 1hour 10min nd 28secs mark
to encode each part abit different as the second
part still had boarders witch i opted to crop out
plus spent hours getting this really nice nd smooth
nd colours better plus there is minutes missing
, HOPE u Enjoy
