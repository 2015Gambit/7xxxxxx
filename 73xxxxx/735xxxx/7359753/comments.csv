,acsmith1972,2012-06-17T07:44Z,What is up with this wrath of the titans bullshit? Tvteam seems to have turned into losers. Take away their trusted icon. 
,logan-x-art,2012-06-17T07:53Z,"I got the same Wrath Of The Titans error...shit is fukn jacked up tonight...

Although I will say this is a first for TvTeam...they are always spot on...
"
,HurricaneA,2012-06-17T09:53Z,"I just uploaded a file and when I didn't use the magnet link it came up as ""wrath of the Titans"". I guess all non-magnet links are affected."
,logan-x-art,2012-06-17T15:31Z,"Wow, I also let this torrent download thru the night and it has went nowhere...

it is still fukn jacked up from last night...

any suggestions on how to fix this problem?...

I let both ""The Firm"" torrents download thru the night and neither has moved an inch...

WTF?"
,R9k6wh0naIK,2012-06-17T16:13Z,"I just downloaded this file from user bantaleko and watched it--it was fast download and is good. 

Just a note--I watch it on my laptop and it's of great quality for that.  "
,ike.m,2012-06-17T18:44Z,use bantaleko link....good...fast
,libertaswv,2012-06-20T01:13Z,"I love TvTeam, but lately..... I dunno. Lot of problems. Hopefully things will improve.

Still no movement on any of their '21's'."
,BuzzDave,2012-07-17T06:25Z,"I dont get it, its been forever that I'm stuck at 99% because of the lack of seed connections"
,nooneyouknow79,2012-08-08T20:16Z,Stuck at 99.9%.  The video is viewable even with the missing piece but whatever is going on with the file makes it so it won't stream to media devices (Unsupported format error).
