GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series race #6 - Lexington Ohio - 9-June-2012

This is the 6th race of the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, held at the Mid-Ohio
Sports Car Course in Lexington Ohio. The EMCO GEARS CLASSIC is a 2 hour 45 minute
timed event run over a 2.258 mile road course of 13 turns. Nine Daytona Prototype
entries and 17 GT class contenders are scheduled to compete.

This download is a .ISO file intended to be written directly to a blank 4.4GB DVD.
Then you can play it on your living room Blu-Ray console connected to your big screen
HDTV. You can also play it on your computer DVD drive with appropriate software. The
video is encoded in a hybrid format called BD5 that is compatible with all Blu-Ray
console players but not likely any DVD consoles.

If you wish to play the download on your computer you can use a virtual DVD emulator
utility, like the free DAEMONTools Lite, to "mount" the .ISO file as a temporary
DVD drive. Then you can play the video directly using any Blu-Ray compatible media
player. I often use CyberLink PowerDVD to watch, and I have also used others such
as the freely available DAPlayer. If you have the correct AVCHD CODECs installed
then even Windows Media Player can be used.

Video: 720p AVCHD H.264 4000Kbps at 59.94Fps
Audio: AC-3 6-channel Dolby 5.1 at 384Kbps and 48KHz

Enjoy!
