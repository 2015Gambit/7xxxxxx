,jd11,2012-06-14T02:46Z,I agree with geckx and honestly shit is too good of a word for this junk.
,QWESTSUX,2012-06-14T03:04Z,"never heard of it, dont know how it got on top 100 so fast and is 1.3 imdb"

,dangeraus,2012-06-14T15:15Z,lol im intrigued how sh1te it can be
,mauvebib,2012-06-14T16:58Z,This is another Asylum release. They butcher the hell out of every movie that comes out. If you like really bad movies cast with mostly has been actors then this company is for you.
,ahnvil,2012-06-14T18:27Z,"granted the film wasn't fantastic, but can anyone rate the quality of the rip?"
,waqar42,2012-06-14T18:34Z,Ratings: 1.3/10 from 12 users 
,prettynerdy,2012-06-14T21:44Z,"THIS IS NOT A MOVIE REVIEW SITE. 

WE WANT TO KNOW THE QUALITY OF THE UPLOAD, NOT THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE.

MAYBE SOME PEOPLE LIKE SHITTY MOVIES. MAYBE YOUR OPINION OF A GOOD MOVIE COMPLETELY DIFFERS FROM MINE. YOU SHOULDN'T CARE WHETHER OR NOT STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET WATCH A MOVIE YOU FELT WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND MEGABYTES.

IF YOU WANT TO REVIEW A MOVIE, GO IMDB OR ROTTENTOMATOES. THIS IS A TORRENT SITE, SO TELL US ABOUT THE TORRENT. NOT YOUR OPINION ON ITS CINEMATIC WORTHINESS.

VIDEO/AUDIO QUALITY. NOT 'OMFG THIS MOVIE TOTALLY SUXX0RZ!' GET IT?

I fucking hate typing in all caps, but I am yelling this at you, so it's somewhat appropriate. Let the bitching commence."

,Kiriyama87,2012-06-15T02:24Z,"@prettynerdy

I like when people rate the movie aswell. If More than half of the comments say the movie shitty awful then I don't have to waste my bandwidth

So calm the fuck down."
,zot4444,2012-06-15T04:21Z,"just trying to stop you lowering your self to this prettynerdy. just tell your self in the mirror your better than that. the list of great films is long, there's no need"
,MrDerrrp,2012-06-15T04:39Z,"Pretty Nerd-  I like the fact that people on this site share their opinions. I think many people on this site, myself included, spend a lot of time downloading  so their opinions are valuable to me. If 10 out of 12 are telling me to stay away i will happily go find something else. However, you do make a good point, if you are going to give your opinion you might as well give the quality as well. 

Cant we all just get along lol"

A-8

M- Hilariously bad"
,prettynerdy,2012-06-15T05:32Z,"If they included a rating for the audio and video, I wouldn't give a shit if they gave their opinion. I'm not against sharing opinions, sorry if it came across that way. But *most of us* want to know about the torrent more than somebody's opinion on the quality of the movie itself.

At least I didn't start calling everyone fags and demanding heads on platters. That makes my mental breakdown okay, right?"
,Z3r0K,2012-06-15T07:29Z,"Sorry prettynerdy but I think it's quite appropriate and helpful for people to rate a movie on here as it saves me effort of checking IMDB.

So i'm all for it.

In terms of video and audio quality, in general you can tell from the title and/or from the rip info in the description. But I too like it when people post numbers :)"
,Z3r0K,2012-06-15T07:34Z,"oh I forgot to mention.

I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE WRITTEN MY COMMENT IN CAPITALS SO YOU COULD SEE HOW IMPORTANT THE ISSUE WAS TO ME AND HOW I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE WRITE IN CAPITALS.

Hopefully my last comment appears also."
,klip1,2012-06-15T08:38Z,"yea, pretty nerdys a hermit fasho"
,jackson5more,2012-06-15T12:39Z,"Prettynerdy ~ RESPECT* You said your peace and rode the wave.  I agree with you - share usefull info... please. At the same time, I do so enjoy reading the chaos.
IMDB = ""In short - watch this movie at your own risk - a little piece of you may wither up and float away if you do....."""
,pjthunder,2012-06-15T13:50Z,"Well I find that most of the ones that say a movie is shitty to a big degree are idiots and wouldn't know a quality movie if their balls would fall off if they picked the wrong choice. Many movies that these moronic nutmunchers called bad movies I find are quite entertaining and some are absolutely excelllent. So don't take these numbnuts word for anything. After all, you CAN delete the movie if you don't like it so quit whining...check em out without the peanut gallery's influence. You may just like them and you'd have missed a good one based on the word of illiterate and tasteless dipshits!!"
,Fritz.,2012-06-15T16:19Z,"
did you know that the average reading level of the general public is down to the 6th grade level these days?

if you are actually intelligent you might as well just be quiet and go on your way because you will just be over-run by the sheer number of idiots that exist today.

...and yes it is just getting worse. every year the human population increases by roughly 80 million and it increases every year ... and the majority of these people are dumb.

think about it."
,mrfactsright,2012-06-15T17:44Z,The cunt that wrote this movie (if you can call it a movie) should have his writing hand crushed and sewn deep up into his arse.
,prettynerdy,2012-06-15T23:01Z,@Z3r0k: Were you yelling? Because I was totally yelling. I didn't say anything important.
,prettynerdy,2012-06-15T23:05Z,"I should have been more clear. Post your opinion, fine. But PLEASE tell us about the quality of the upload as well. 15 comments that say ""This sucks!"" doesn't help us at all. Why does it suck? Does the video come through choppy? Does the audio not sync up at all? Or is it just that you disliked the movie itself? You hate the movie, but what's the upload like?

I should also make it clear that nothing short of a gun to the face would make me watch this movie, but my point is still the same. Rate the movie if you want, but please rate the UPLOAD itself, as well."
,Gobbledegeek,2012-06-16T03:47Z,lol @ cunts arguing again
,rica5mend,2012-06-16T07:01Z,"this movie was so touching, it made me cry :'("
,TtToker,2012-06-16T08:02Z,"prettynerdy, GET OVER YOURSELF. this site isn't made for commenting on quality, its just for sharing. yes there's a comment section so why not share opinions, not only on quality but how Good or awful the movie is too? Out of all the people saying how awful the film is, nobody said the quality was bad so there's your first clue that its good quality, & when the movie is uploaded by a trusted user (skull) then you can just assume its good quality. that's usually one of the first things you learn after using this site for just a short time. you're bitching about nobody leaving A/V but out of all the comments you've posted I see bitching/whinning but no A/V or even opinions on the movie, which I'd much rather see than you crying about all the opinions you've seen. I won't see this film thanks to all the comments. so i can't rate A/V, but I will thank the uploader and all those that have commented on the movie to keep me from wasting time. but after you decide to post more shit on here defending your previous posts, know that I won't waste anymore time of mine by coming back or anybody elses time by arguing with you here in the COMMENT SECTION.  ENJOY THE FILM!"
,megz2608,2012-06-16T08:09Z,"Shit film . A8 V8 . Stop fucking moaning. If people r as dumb as ya make out then how the fuck can they read ya long winded, utterly boring comments . Did ya all help write the script for this dodgy film..?"
,quimkaos,2012-06-16T22:34Z,lowest ratting i've seen in IMDB... 1.6 from 144 users
,Dapped,2012-06-18T05:00Z,i thought it was o.k. Not a 10 but a 6 or 7. The price was right!
,cacciatore,2012-06-18T17:55Z,Best movie E V E R
,icelevel,2012-06-18T23:25Z,prettynerdy your fucking fag...theres no rules for what you can write..if someone wants p책 write their opnion about a movie..fine..its a good thing..if someone wants to write about the quality...fine also good..and if someone wants to write that you are a fucking fag...fine also very good
,4stanktoe,2012-06-19T03:35Z,"If it's a shit movie, I don't care what the quality is. Thanks for the info and saving me from wasting time."
,jarp1693,2012-06-19T22:53Z,"OMG this movie SUCKED!
Quality is good but the fil maker needs a new job"
