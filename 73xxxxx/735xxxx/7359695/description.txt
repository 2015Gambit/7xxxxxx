Storyline:
The Sunset Limited is a searing, two character drama that mixes humor and pathos while examining the relationship between two strangers who are brought together by desperate circumstances.
The story focuses on two very different men ΓÇô a deeply religious black ex-con (Samuel L. Jackson) who thwarts the suicide attempt of an asocial white college professor
(Tommy Lee Jones), who tried to throw himself in front of an oncoming subway train, the Sunset Limited.
As the one attempts to connect on a rational, spiritual and emotional level, the other remains steadfast in his hard-earned despair.
As their philosophical debate progresses, each spar passionately to defend their personal credo and convert the other.
