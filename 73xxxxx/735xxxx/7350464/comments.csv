,xpmule,2012-06-15T00:22Z,"very little difference
i wouldn't dump Ultimate for this

i google'd what the difference was and it was so userless and stupid i forgot what it was lol
so i have never used this edition.

my advice is spend time customing your os instead, kill start up app's
kil as many services you don't need
and if you don't have an SSD ?
Get a good 3rd party defrag program
such as perfect disk.. im sure you get the idea.. lol

cool thing about this would be the integrated updates but im still confused why groups don't release the Ultimate SKU with updates though"

,R.Hood,2012-06-21T21:29Z,"This program after burned to DVD remains at 0% Extracting Files for over an hour. I tried 4 times an each time it never gets past 0%..the longest i waited was 1:45 Mins. I used UltraISO to burn the DVD and also...I tried 4 different burns.

Anyone else experience issues....or have suggestion?

Possibly it can only be an ""Upgrade"" and not a ""New"" Install?"
