Freddie Flintoff Goes Wild
Is a series of epic wildlife adventures and extreme experiences in his own inimitable style Freddie takes us on a journey into the wild and shows us some of the world's most exciting spectacles as we've never seen them before? In the midst of it, experiencing the fear, excitement, joy and wonder of being up close and personal with nature at its most spectacular. On his journeys he goes to different wildernesses in Australia, Borneo, Tanzania and Canada.


1)  Australia 
Freddie Flintoff is in the remote wilderness of Arnhemland, Australia searching for saltwater crocodiles with his Aboriginal hosts Joseph, Connie and Moses their grandson. Within a matter of hours Joseph lands the first kill - a wallaby. Starving, Freddie looks forward to the traditionally cooked meat. The build up to the rainy season complete with heat, humidity and constant mosquitoes make for gruelling conditions and a hunt for magpie geese tests Freddie's patience. Unpredictable storms force them into a boat as the waters rise. Travelling, Freddie becomes aware of both the freshwater and saltwater crocodiles all around them and a near miss with a disgruntled croc bring home the danger. The final croc encounter is a mix of adrenalin fuelled apprehension as Joseph tries to catch one for their supper.
