[V],Nepotu,2012-06-15T14:33Z,"You are all welcome, my friends.
@Dimmis80: Yes, you have to DL those 3 parts only if you want to watch only the game 2. The torrent include a 540p version of game 1 also (not in those 3 parts; in a 4th file). Cheers, mate!"

,mentallyours,2012-06-15T17:07Z,"The Miami Heat jumped out to a big lead (18-2) in the first quarter and then held off a furious Oklahoma City rally to beat the Thunder 100-96 and tie the NBA Finals at 1-1 heading to south Florida. The Thunder got back to within two points and had a chance to tie the game in the closing seconds, but a shot by Kevin Durant bounced off the rim. Durant thought he'd been fouled by LeBron James, but no whistles blew. The stars for both teams shined bright. James and Durant led all scorers with 32 apiece. James also had eight rebounds and five assists with 12 of his points coming at the free throw line, including the last two of the game. Durant took only six foul shots, about half his normal number. Dwyane Wade added 24 points on 10-for-20 shooting to go along with six rebounds and five assists. Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook got off to a terrible start (1-for-8), but finished strong (18 second-half points) to end the game with 27. He also had eight rebounds and seven assists. James Harden bounced back from a bad first game to score 21 points on 7-for-11 shooting. The Heat got a big long-range night from Shane Battier as he nailed five 3-pointers and ended with 17 points. Chris Bosh added 16 while grabbing 15 rebounds, seven of those on the offensive end.
