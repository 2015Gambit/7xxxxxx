Extended Play is the 5-song EP released by The Pretenders in 1981 but never released digitally. The first four tracks are available elsewhere, but the fifth track, Precious, recorded live in Central Park on Aug 30 1980, only exists on the original vinyl EP. It was never released on a CD. So that track is from a vinyl rip that I found on the internet. Enjoy!
