[T],Ching_Liu,2012-06-18T05:07Z,Uninstall the old versions of Nero and have a clean install. You may need registery clean for old keys.
,psikofunkster,2012-06-29T03:14Z,"No intention to troll but this doesn't work for me, i uninstall build 11.2.0900 and then
install this, doesn't work, says key has expired, i tried to reinstall my old 11.2.0900 and i can't do it now. Same message even rpag keys are rejected."
,Gian.Krl0,2012-06-29T20:11Z,"Thanks for share Ching_Liu, this works great!

Tested with Nero trial spanish version in Windows XP SP3 32bits spanish."
,dogman514,2012-07-04T16:56Z,when installing nero MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION IS OFF. Also in your firewall set it to BLOCK UPDATES.your should not have any problems
,lazer9,2012-07-18T03:21Z,Which file to block in firewall? I assume NCC.exe 
,santosh16,2012-09-05T19:28Z,"thanks ching lui , great work man!!!
i have just one doubt ,i have done all the installation work what you have told , it works great but the ""nero 11"" is asking internet connection , whether 
i have to connect it with internet or not to retain my activation"
