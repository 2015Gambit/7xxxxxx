
This is a HUGE collection of music videos all being 720pHD and mixed in variety of genres. It was compiled by me codename "Twiinahi" a 17Yo kid with a passion for soundwaves which soon lead me to creating this HUGE collection of 585Music videos (Give or take) This is also my first upload to the world and hopefully one of many to come, so please enjoy and give me feed back on your thoughts. 


Note - Some of the MusicVideos (About 10) aren't automatically recognized by windows as Mpeg4 but as .Files for some reason. To play just double-click and open with a media-player personally i prefer Vlc.
