Could you please upload the Argentina game as well."
,TaiTheGuy,2012-07-28T15:47Z,"Some advice to anyone who wants to download (or upload) any Olympic events/videos:

Searching ThePirateBay for ""Olympic"", returns COMPLETELY different results than searching for ""Olympics"", with an S at the end.

If you're gonna upload, Use the singular with NO S. That's what ""The Olympic Bay"" link, on the home page points to.
P.S. I'll post this on a few different torrents so people maybe start getting in sync. "
