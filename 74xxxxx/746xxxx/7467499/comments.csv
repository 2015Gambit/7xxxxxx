,KrazyKrvs,2012-07-23T23:05Z,K...  But wat shud i do with the links u have posted here buddy...???
,arindam_ghosh,2012-07-24T11:55Z,"sorry buddy. i uploaded with wrong torrent name and there is no way to modify that. so, not getting hits... :( thats why i posted the link in this torrent :( plz dont mind. and though our torrents are of same episode, but in different format and size, so it should not conflict each others interest... and as a a matter of fact i am uploading only SMJ torrents for public awareness. 
so plz dont mind the link..... i hope u will understand my point.... and dont worry, ot wont happen again...... :)"
,KrazyKrvs,2012-07-24T12:34Z,"No problem buddy.... Just make sure you upload it with the right name..... Any work related to SMJ is appreciated.....
If u wanna rectify ur torrent request for deletion on tpb forums & re-upload it...."
,arindam_ghosh,2012-07-24T18:31Z,"thank you very much for understanding and the advice :) but it seems, the thread link of deletion of torrent and hash is not there anymore. or is it just me :O ... will look into this matter in the forum :) thanks again......"
