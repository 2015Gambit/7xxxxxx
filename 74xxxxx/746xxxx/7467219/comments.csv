[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-07-26T06:57Z,"Geordie Shore is nearly impossible for me to do. I would if I could, but I have no doubts I would be no better than the guys who are already upping it. I have tried several times but it won't let me get the whole thing. And I try my best to provide good quality all the time. I will keep trying, but not confident :("
,bexwey,2012-07-26T09:55Z,"Ah I see, thats a shame, these other guys are not nearly as good as you!  They still have put up ep 5 which aired almost 36 hours ago!!  I am pulling my hair out!! HAHAHAHAAHAA, thanks for trying though Gary xx"
