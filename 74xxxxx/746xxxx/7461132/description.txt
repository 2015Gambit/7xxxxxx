 Adam (Alex Pettyfer) is a slacker who moves to Tampa, Florida to live with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn). He gets a job at a local construction company and there he meets Mike Lane (Channing Tatum). However, Adam quits on his first day after the supervisor catches him stealing extra sodas.

The following day, Adam spots Mike about to enter a popular nightclub. Mike gets him into the club, and Adam soon learns that Mike is a stripper known as "Magic Mike". Mike takes Adam to the strip club and introduces him to the manager, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) and the other dancers - Ken (Matt Bomer), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Tito (Adam Rodr√≠guez) and Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello). Dallas agrees to let Adam help out with props that night as a favor to Mike.

The club's DJ, drug dealer Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias), provides the dancers with samples of refined GHB to improve their stamina. However, Tarzan ingests too much of the drug, and is unable to perform. Mike convinces Adam to fill in for him, and Adam is a hit with the customers. Afterwards, Adam is convinced to join the Xquisite and Mike nicknames him "The Kid".

Mike and Brooke's attraction continues to grow in the following months, despite that Brooke is dating a man who lives in Orlando and Mike has an on-again off-again relationship with a woman named Joanna (Olivia Munn). Adam delves further into the excessive lifestyle of the Xquisite dancers, using drugs and having sexual encounters with many clients. When Dallas announces he has a plan to move their act to Miami, Mike confides in Brooke that he wants to retire from the business in the near future and has been attempting to get a small business loan to pursue his dream of opening a custom furniture business. Mike later attends a hurricane party at Dallas' house.
