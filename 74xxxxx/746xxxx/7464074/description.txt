Ra-kon-tur - Cocaine Cowboys II

In 1991, Charles Cosby was selling ounces of cocaine on the inner-city streets of Oakland, California. Bringing in a couple grand a week, he was living the new American Dream.

Then he wrote a fan letter to ΓÇ£Cocaine GodmotherΓÇ¥ Griselda Blanco ΓÇô immortalized in rakonturΓÇÖs Cocaine Cowboys ΓÇô who was serving time at a nearby federal prison. Six months later, he was a multi-millionaire.

Charles was not only running BlancoΓÇÖs $40 million a year cocaine business, he was also her lover. When she recruited him to participate in a prison break that involved the kidnapping of JFK Jr., Charles knew he was in over his head.

Also known as ΓÇ£The Black Widow,ΓÇ¥ for her propensity to permanently dispose of her men when sheΓÇÖs done with them (or when they betray her), Griselda would stop at nothing to ensure that Charles was faithful to her. And he would learn that lesson the hard way.

This is the story of a kid from the streets who (literally) gets in bed with a Colombian queenpin. ItΓÇÖs New Jack City meets Scarface ΓÇô only the truth!.
