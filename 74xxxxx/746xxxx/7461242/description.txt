Information
------------------------------

This intriguing documentary series examines freak occurrences in the natural world. Whether it's animals behaving oddly or even the planet that perplexes, each episode sees scientists studying baffling phenomena in a bid to understand what Mother Nature's really up to. The reasons behind incidents will vary, but there's one conclusion that we always reach: the world isn't as predictable as we'd like to think.



Episode 3 : The Bodiless Bear

This programme looks at a series of brutal attacks on black bears in Yellowstone Park, including the extraordinary case of a severed bear head. In 1990, whilst hiking through Yellowstone National Park, bear expert Dr David Mattson came across a most hideous and unbelievable sight: the severed head of a black bear. The case of the bodiless bear, and three subsequent bear slayings, would go on to shed new light on what scientists understand about bears and their habitat.
