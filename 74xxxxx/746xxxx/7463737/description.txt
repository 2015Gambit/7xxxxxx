Here is the Canadian Version of Quicken Cash Manager 2012. I have some requests from the good souls of this community:

1) Please please please help seed. I don't know how long I can maintain my own seeding. 

2) I would love it if someone could upload a torrent of Quicken Home & Business 2012. A generous individual can install this software and then upgrade to Home & Business for a fraction of the price of buying it new. 

Enjoy!
