,osriccc,2012-07-25T05:08Z,"Had to remove subtitles with MKV merge because they were corrupted. The quality is fine but sound gets effed up like 20 seconds before the credits end, so you won't be able to understand the funny after credtis scene in the very end (I tried different PCs and this happens, a no, it's not because me messing up the MKV because I tried in the ""original"" also)."
