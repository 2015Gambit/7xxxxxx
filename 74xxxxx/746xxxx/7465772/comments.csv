[V],joshua13,2012-07-23T04:07Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2296895/ 

not in korean. if it were, so what? Korean people don't want torrents? the only problem is that since TV Team does not write description, people aren't told."
,sanitybleeds,2012-07-23T06:15Z,"As per the info file, it IS in Korean, and thus far, no english subs available http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2342301/"

,-G-rad,2012-07-26T01:00Z,"Looks like there is no more 100% seeders... I've got subs and the whole 62.7% of a file.
Shame - there is plenty of good Korean films and I was curious about this one :-("
,-G-rad,2012-08-02T19:28Z,"63.1% and stopped for few days now...
I'm switching to this one:
