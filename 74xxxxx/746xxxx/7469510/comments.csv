,mantikor777,2012-07-24T19:35Z,"@PiratCali - in what way?  Obama and his ilk are much more in bed with the movie and music industry seeking to destroy the open internet - you typify the empty headed lefty.  Get a freakin' clue, puke."

For Friedman everything is money and what does not sell should disappears is kind of evolution of the species, only the strong will survive!
But Friedman is WRONG!!

What he does not understand is that is collaboration what makes life (and societies) to what it is! Think just about the human body, thousand of different cells types collaborating (not competing) to make us function."
,PiratCali,2012-07-26T20:24Z,"You think I don't know Obama's an entertainment industry tool? I'm the farthest thing from an apologist for him.

This book seems out of place because, being a believer in the freedom of the individual, Friedman no doubt would have disapproved of the free sharing of copyrighted content, which he would likely have seen as a species of communism. "

Q: Intellectual property rights are under attack. Could you dwell a little on that?

MF: The question of intellectual property rights is very complicated. Freedom of speech is the opposite of copyright, which means that you can't get copyright rights. And, intellectual property is different from physical property: in both cases, you have a monopoly but the monopoly on intellectual property is wholly different because duplicating the property comes generally at a very low or zero marginal cost. You are enforcing a monopoly pricing, as it were, that limits output to lower than the optimum social level. You cannot be in favor of infinite copyright. Essentially it's a problem of practical compromise, whether you have 17 years, 25 years, 10 years, 50 years.

Also, TPB is like a library in some respects, except it is not funded by taxpayer money - even better!"
