World's Most Dangerous Roads Series 2
Pairs of celebrities on terrifying car journeys: as the first series showed, it's a formula with a happy mix of jokes and jeopardy. Thanks to all your comments for the first Series, we decided to present you the second part of Most Dangerous Roads In The World. Mostly it includes the roads that you have suggested as well as other well known and popular dangerous roads. Have a great time checking these!


1)  Siberia 
Good friends and fellow comedians Ed Byrne and Andy Parsons brave temperatures as low as minus fifty to drive across Siberia's infamous Road of Bones. Along the way they encounter all that Siberia can throw at them from terrifying roads of ice and deserted gulags, to the surprising welcome of the people who inhabit this freezing wilderness. Ed and Andy soon learn the rules of road in this remote region - never turn the car engine off and refuel on the go but the further they get along the road, the more they realize they are out of their depth
