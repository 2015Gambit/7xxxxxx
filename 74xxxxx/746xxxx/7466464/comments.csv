,gamester2,2012-07-23T17:35Z,you people been requesting this all over the web and now where are you....seed pleaseeeeeee! i for one am tired of playing the last story without actually being able to follow the story
,gamester2,2012-07-23T19:12Z,oh well i guess im not getting this one it just wont download....the search continues
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-23T19:16Z,"fuck me, i just got home, 0 bytes uploaded all day long.. as i mentioned, i just reinstalled my server and i finished at 03:45 AM local time, so i havent got much testing... i'm sorry"
,gamester2,2012-07-23T23:05Z,"its cool it started im at 23 percent but it stopped, im not gonna give up"
,Guytsu,2012-07-24T02:16Z,"I'd like to ask what you consider ""less essential"" when it comes to cutscenes.  The past rips I've downloaded removed every instance of other languages besides english, and the file size was enough to fit on a single dvd after that. Removing cutscenes as well seems a bit odd.

I'm not complaining, mind you. I'm grateful to be able to play this game in any form (having no money and no way to get any makes life a bummer) and I truly appreciate the time spent uploading this. I just felt I should ask. "
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-24T02:39Z,"@Guytsu: """"""The past rips I've downloaded removed every instance of other languages besides english, and the file size was enough to fit on a single dvd after that.""""""

can you please link me some? i suspect those rips cheated, like used the same background music multiple places - which you wouldnt notice.

im new to wii-ripping, im making these isos because for a long time before i used a modchip  and there were no dvd5 rips available whatsoever (see metroid other m for example). there are only a few dvd5 rips published still: http://thepiratebay.se/search/dvd5/0/99/405"
,gamester2,2012-07-24T03:45Z,"i'm at 80 percent then i'll set to seed, i didnt understand the cut scene thing either, but we all skip some of those anyway, this will be the only fully working dvd5 on the entire web if it works, the one i uploaded would stop for a few second during fights and stuff but it wasnt really ""mine"" i just converted the undub wich blew and never worked for anyone, i also got a dl disc and tried that, img burn said to be a success but it would not read, so this will be my 3rd attempt at an english copy but if i had to make a prediction i'd say this will work, i trust the uploader and appreciate this alottttttt"
,gamester2,2012-07-24T05:23Z,"12 people cant leech this from 1 person yall, i hope you all will be seeding when ur done"
,gamester2,2012-07-24T14:15Z,VERIFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WORKING ENGLISH DVD5 NO ISSUES
,gamester2,2012-07-24T14:22Z,"played till i fell asleep then played when i woke up started over, working on a single layer disc, dvd5, everything looks great eng voice and txt, i noticed occasionally when you talk to a merchant or someone less involved in the story you get txt only but the whole thing is full english, loving this!!!!! thank you sooo so much uploader, i searched every site on the web, and make no mistake THIS IS THE ONLY WORKING ENGLISH DVD5 ONLINE, i will seed another day until i see its been picked up by the masses who have requested this everywhere"
,gamester2,2012-07-24T14:25Z,WORKS!!!!!!!! NO ISSUES< BEEN PLAYING ON A SINGLE LAYER DVD ALL NIGHT!!!!!! FULL ENG LANG AND TXT!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!
,gamester2,2012-07-24T16:56Z,"make sure you comment and thank the uploader, i asked him for this and he deserves praise for this work, he took the time to alter the iso to a working 4.37 and its by far the best work on last story to date"
,Randompersonguy,2012-07-24T20:02Z,"Well, the game works, but why did you have to remove the cutscenes? In the very beginning, it skips a cutscene. It's all ""a few days earlier.."" and then nothing, the cutscene doesn't even show. It kind of makes me not want to play the game now. RPGs aren't worth playing if you can't experience the story. The story is the whole point, and cutscenes are one of the most prominent ways to display important story segments. 

Still, thanks for uploading and all that "
,gamester2,2012-07-24T21:11Z,"oh i didnt notice that i was playing the jap version and had 2 save games level 6 and level 17 it let me continue from 6 idk why but i really didnt wanna have to go through the first 5 levels again anyway, i kept downloading burning and starting new games that were bad copies so i was just ready to play from 6, and for the english from there i am grateful, i dont see how that would throw you off the whole game if you want the begining synopsis go watch on youtube then start it, some of us had no option to play at all and are less critical of a few cutscenes, no disrespect to your review but this is the only dvd5 out that works, and it makes me think people just like to bitch about anything"
,Guytsu,2012-07-24T21:30Z,"@dt7ll5op

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean past downloads of this particular game. I meant downloads of other dual-layered/dvd9 Wii games, such as Xenoblade (for one example) 

So far, the game works perfectly. I haven't even been able to tell what cutscenes were removed, and so far it hasn't been a problem. Thank you very much for taking the time to upload this "
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-24T21:47Z,"@Randompersonguy: it's a rip. you have to remove something.
cutscenes can be watched on youtube or you can extract the videos from the dvd9 image and view them on your pc (mplayer plays them). the point is you can PLAY the game from a dvd5 disc, something you otherwise wouldnt be able to do.
my opinion is if you cannot tolerate this tradeoff, you still have the option to go softmod or buy the game."
,gamester2,2012-07-24T23:01Z,"well you have to be softmodded anyway in order to work but yea i get what you mean, they can use loader software and 8 gb drives,  that really gets me to like yea you have the option of buying it, people shouldnt complain and especially if you cant rip it yourself, cause hey you all do have the option of making us all a dvd5 with all cutscenes if you know how to, this guy did us all a huge solid, you can bitch about cutscenes when you upload better, and you CAN FOLLOW THE STORY HERE, and tutorials are a giant HELP from the jap version, i cant wait till my 6 yr old is in bed so i can play, the game is amazzzzzing, i have a dvd5 of xenoblade wich is next on my list though pandoras tower looks good too"
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-25T10:32Z,"xenoblade's got a dvd5 rip? where? because it's not on tpb so i started to work on that too. and yeah, that one would fit on a dvd5 with all the cutscenes intact, only multilanguage removed.. this one and metroid_other_m doesnt. i could recompress the videos, but i dont have the experience and patience, and when i only had modchip, i would die for a dvd5 of any kind, so i thought it would be helpful enough in this imperfect form for others.
can you please give me a link to xeno dvd5?"
,gamester2,2012-07-25T13:14Z,"if i can find the link, if not i'll just re upload my copy, a perfect dvd5, played last story all night and no probs, no cut scenes removed between levels 6 and 14, though i noticed a subliminal msg....hahahahaha, changing scenes like a rabbit or something, lmfao"
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-25T20:25Z,"@gamester2: thats a cutscene removed. i could not just remove the movies, that way the game freezed, i had to replace them with an other movie, so i looked for very small sized movies in my wii games and found this one in a raving rabbids game"
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-26T03:00Z,"fyi i took a look at the ntsc-japan release, cutscenes are compressed 60% smaller than in pal release, thats why that fits to a dvd5. and those files cannot be replaced with jap versions because of the audio."
,gamester2,2012-07-27T05:29Z,"well idk where you learned to link 2 games like that or how you knew thats what it needed, i thought it was a msg to kill all rabbits....lol, i am extracting a xenoblade iso from my dvd5 copy right now, i'll try to get it up here asap!"
,gamester2,2012-07-28T04:28Z,i hope you saw i put xenoblade up for ya bro
,jopeto_1982,2012-08-21T13:53Z,no
