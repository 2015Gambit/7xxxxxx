Bates' Guide to Physical Examination and History Taking is designed for students of health professions who are learning to talk with patients, to perform their physical examinations, and to apply clinical reasoning to understanding and assessing patient concerns. The tenth edition has many new features to facilitate student learning, detailed in the paragraphs to follow. As with previous editions, these changes spring from three sources: the queries of teachers and students; the goal of making the book easier to read and more efficient to use; and the abundant new evidence that underpins the techniques of interviewing, examination, and promoting health.
Bates' tenth helps students build on basic knowledge of human anatomy and physiology as they acquire the lifelong and timeless skills of patient assessment. Throughout the book, we emphasize common or important problems rather than the rare and esoteric. Occasionally, physical signs of rare disorders are included if they hold a solid niche in classic physical diagnosis or represent a disorder that is critical to the life of the patient. Each chapter explicitly reflects a strong evidence-based perspective, listing key citations that closely align content with new evidence from the health care literature. Color helps readers find chapter sections and tables more easily, and it highlights insets of key material and special tips for challenging aspects of examination such as examining the eye or assessing the jugular venous pressure. More than 85 new and revised photographs and drawings have been added to better illustrate key points in the accompanying text. All tables remain vertical so readers can page through the chapters more easily without turning the book to its side.
