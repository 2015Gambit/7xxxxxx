,SerSpec-V,2012-07-23T00:42Z,"@staldamen: If you look at the SE/LE most people want the lower res over the HD. Many people have DL limits, need it to fit on a DVD, don't have super high speed internet or just want DL it and watch it ASAP. "
,matrix86,2012-07-23T00:56Z,guys plssss more seeeeeeeeeeed

Anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the race broadcast?"
,digimike50,2012-07-23T04:03Z,"You are the greatest, footy - thanks!"
,Sanyi001,2012-07-23T07:07Z,"once again, awesome near-HD quality! Beauty, footy.
I appreciate in separating the pre-race and race, but perhaps can you also separate the post-race stuff too? After the podium press conference would be a good cut-off point!
Just a suggestion, thank u"
,nobodynever,2012-07-23T10:27Z,"This was probably the most interesting race I've seen.  I'm half way done watching.

Oh and A10,V10,R11"
,frostbite88,2012-07-23T13:57Z,wait for HD ver 
,sabesm,2012-07-23T14:27Z,waiting for HD
,silvah-,2012-07-23T16:27Z,"hey footy,

my ps3 cant seem to recognize the videofile.
is this release any different from your earlier releases? cause they have worked all the time."
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-23T19:13Z,"^^^That's because it's a MKV, you will have to convert it.  For everyone that needs to convert it to another format I recommend Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate."
,checkit81,2012-07-24T10:00Z,"@mr2man

Name of the song at the end of broadcast 'Welcome Home' by Radical Face!"
,Tzenish,2012-07-26T03:29Z,"Footy, please bring back the 720 p races with pre and post stuff. We really miss the awesome quality! Thank you very much for the excellent job ! "
,13hoot,2012-07-27T20:52Z,Nice torrent. Though i like BBC the best. and for my PS3 user. Mine is working fine. Which Media Server do you use. I would recommend you using Serviio (free download). Converts and lets me play most of my files. It also manages a good coverage of my 4TB HDD
