Grammar for Young Learners
Gordon Lewis, Hans Mol

Oxford University Press, 15-July-2009 - 160 pages

This book helps teachers of young learners to introduce and practise grammar in a fun and motivating way. Steers a middle course between grammar-based and communicative approaches to teaching: meaning is the main focus of all language teaching and grammar is an intrinsic part of making meaning explicit.
