,GM_CSH,2012-07-22T21:28Z,"excellent, loving your work. particularly enjoyed the pissing match between you and pss on my torrent aka forum lol. to clear this all up i have the editing suites on my desktop. i use multiple conversion programs, virtual dub etc etc etc. i been at this for years im not new to the game but cheers to both of you for the advice i now know more than i did yesterday lol. i have sky HD and yes its hooked up to my pc, i got all the streams you could dream of from hbo, justintv the list is endless. may the torrenting force be with both of you, and if i ever borrow one of your files for conversion i will be sure to thank you in the info. ppp:)"

[T],trialNerror,2012-07-23T19:57Z,"lol that pissing match has been going on for months and months. ever since i said no more xvid and went to x264.  he HATES it because it doesn't play on his ""old gear"". whatever. i've told him and everyone else that has ""old gear"" that there's NEW gear which costs $50-$60 (same price as that cheap old gear they bought 10 years ago) which will play EVERYTHING you can download; avi, mp4, mkv, flv, wmv, etc., etc...

anyway. i've only been doing this for maybe a couple years now.  learned a lot from doom9 and videohelp and went from using bloated conversion suites to using a simple batch command file with about a dozen lines of commands that are linked to a local avisynth script.  of course i have to use some software to record and clip out commercials, but everything after that (indexing, converting, muxing) is done by the .bat file. all i see when converting videos is a cmd window detailing the progress. it's a little faster than using GUI and IMHO makes a little bit better picture."
