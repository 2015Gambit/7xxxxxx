,jeepy9494,2012-07-28T07:32Z,Nice work! Hope others will seed!
,miamisunset,2012-07-30T13:27Z,"I wouldn't make a claim of it being the most complete with it missing a lot of episodes that have been available in other torrents. Only S11E02 seems to be unavailable. That was re-aired back in June in the US but it seems nobody caught it.

I use to have the other missing episodes but I deleted them after watching them."

Will seed as much as possible. Thanks guys!"
,seed9754,2012-08-07T15:32Z,"Rockin torrent man... I was putting one together of my own slowly but you beat me too it :))

Mucho thanks - this will be seeded at least by me for a long time to come"
