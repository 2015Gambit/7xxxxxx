this is unix system v. i purchased all the disks from a computer shop in kansas city mo. that went out of business as well as about 400 other software packages. i ripped each floppy into .img images. i have also included magic iso 5.5 for so you may write the .img images to floppies. and install. it runs great on my older sun servewr and my old pentium pro server. for more details check out my site.

i am also building my own computer operating system and am always looking for more oses to try out. if you have one to share send me an email or contact me. my info is on the site.
