High Performance, High Quality, Small Files
 
With Replay Video Capture, you'll get amazing video quality, or compact portable files. You can choose between high-quality, high-speed MPEG-2 files, or smaller Windows Media (WMV) files.
 
Replay Video Capture's super-fast MPEG-2 codecs don't bog down your CPU, so you won't lose video frames or get choppy audio. These are preferred for high-motion video, or for use on slower PC's.
 
For the audio track, Replay Video Capture captures what you hear from your PC's speakers by default. Or, you can choose to narrate using the microphone instead, which is great for PowerPoint presentations and software demos.
