,starsprite3,2012-08-21T22:41Z,"Excellent download.  A:10; V:10.  Loved the movie.  Thanks for sharing scene4all.  One thing, this wasn't just about blacks it was about all races and how they intermingled and interacted with each other.  There were cliques aplenty but that has been the way of the younger generation since the beginning.  Don't believe me just ask your parents or grandparents (which I am a grandparent).  The music might be different but the underlaying theme could be from any year you could name all the way back to the first school to be built.  If I, at 58, could relate then anyone could.  The Party is a really good movie.  "
,SenorCovert,2012-09-05T06:10Z,"@Teslaforthewin I'm afraid you are incorrect. there are numerous countries in which racism is illegal. just google ""hate speech"" and you'll find that the protections many countries are afforded by freedom of speech laws do not exist in every country."
