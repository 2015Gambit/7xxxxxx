,.Leto.,2012-07-24T18:55Z,"Thanks, good quality. The problem is this was so boring that I was in Fast-Forward most of the time. If you want a show with a lot of pointless talking and lame acts you'll be happy. But if like me you were expecting great matches you're going to be seriously disappointed. The only decent match is the last one, Cena vs CM Punk. 3 hours watched in about 20 minutes..."
,KKKDownlow,2012-07-24T21:49Z,Only good thing about the show was Lita's breast slip after the moonsault.
