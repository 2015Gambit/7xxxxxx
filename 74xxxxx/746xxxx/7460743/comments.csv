,LePatay,2012-07-20T18:24Z,Thanks dude. Dya know when the full pirated release will come out?
,almostD,2012-07-20T18:29Z,"Nope, that's why I bought a license."
,marcdexterous14,2012-07-20T19:15Z,when you buy the regular Element 3D plugin (the one for 149.95) Does it come with the license?? Im willing to just do that.
,almostD,2012-07-20T19:30Z,"Have a look on the videocopilot site.

I think you get two license, one for a desktop pc and one for a laptop. I haven't got mine yet. The bank transfer is taking ages!"
,blnc9949,2012-07-20T20:18Z,"How do I reset all the models once at a time ?
Please help :)"
,jackoos,2012-07-20T20:40Z,"how do you think? it will be work if i buy element plugin for 149,95 and rest product like pro shaders and model pack download from torrent?"
,almostD,2012-07-20T20:49Z,"You have to set specular and normal map percentage, set shininess, reflection, refraction etc.

For every model you have to set textures manually.

There are no guides, you can peek the settings in youtube videos but it's a long work."
,conngrand,2012-07-21T00:00Z,Has anyone figured out how to render these in the Scene Setup yet
,blnc9949,2012-07-21T13:06Z,"But where will I put this folder, that I downloaded ?   :)"

,FarCry1,2012-07-21T15:46Z,"How do you load those in after effects? When i try to import it gives me unsupported file type, any ideas? Thanks "
,goku242,2012-07-21T16:32Z,hey if your element3D still crash watch this 
,goku242,2012-07-21T16:35Z,/andrewkramer2 and watch the update driver video
,goku242,2012-07-21T16:36Z,go to youtube
,blnc9949,2012-07-21T19:10Z,"But when I open element in after effects, it still asks me for the license, and your (almostD) scene setup crack doesn't work for my 32bit Win7.. :(
What to do ?"
,almostD,2012-07-21T19:51Z,"I'm sorry, no idea, I think Element 3D is only 64bit.

Anyway, yesterday I finally got my License, no more crack problems.

Nobody is working on a crack for what I know. The waiting may be long (several months).

Having a real license let you have the latest updates and if they add stuff you don't have to wait for a new crack. I see several things are missing and I hope they will add them soon!

Regards to all and hope however a crack comes soon."
,almostD,2012-07-21T19:55Z,"Fbx files are for Maya. Don't use them.

Obj quads are OBJ in squared polygons, you can use them with other programs.

You should open obj in triangles because Element works only with triangle polygons."
,MEAGIM,2012-07-22T16:34Z,"can you SEARCH for scene setup  CRACK !!
 ;p give me only CRACK 100% working
 i sent you 20 euro with VISA;p"
