Transferred from a VHS library tape that is about 20 years old, so be kind in criticism.  As a theatre presentation, this compares to the Hollywood version with Jose Ferrer as well as any that portrays the realism of on-stage acting can do (much better at times).  IΓÇÖve seen both the 1950 version on the big screen, and this from 1974, and I believe the extemporaneous reactions found in live theatre are superior in many ways.  Peter Donat had done many other fine portrayals on TV, with 106 acting titles per IMDB. 
Peter is a nephew of actor Robert Donat, who was most notable as Mr. Chipping in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939) with Greer Garson.

In Edmond RostandΓÇÖs swashbuckling yet bittersweet comedy, the characters experience emotions on a heroic scale.  The playΓÇÖs hero, Cyrano,is a magnificent wit whose pride marks a deep insecurity about his appearance ΓÇô specifically, his abnormally large nose.  His compelling love for the beautiful heroine, Roxanne, is the motivating force behind all the action in the play.  With words from his own poetΓÇÖs heart, Cyrano wins Roxanne for another man, the tongue-tied but handsome Christian.
