Plot:

As the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's teddy bear, Ted, came to life and has been by John's side ever since - a 

friendship that's tested when Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, wants more from their relationship. 


Sources - VIDEO: 720 files ....Thanks :P
          AUDIO: CM8        ...Thanks :P

Notes-
ok we got handed the 720 files so we thought we'd add to the 100's of releases of TED...altered perspective,cropped and 

rotated a little then altered the contrast colour and brightness a little
audio was taken from CM8 release.. seemed to be the best from a not great bunch lol... didnt fit straight on so a little 

sync job needed to be done..
all in all a decent copy and made me laugh just working on it.. maybe a new source round the corner so watch this space

Enjoy!!
