thank you so much :D "
,ampho,2012-07-22T03:59Z,Very decent cam. A8 V7. Cheers uploader
,ThwiX,2012-07-22T22:15Z,"@SD_rocks Yeah, I hate those Americans too."
,coke84,2012-07-23T04:23Z,"[A CAM NOT A BLURAY] 

yet it's posted as a highres movie.."
,aiigghht,2012-07-23T05:10Z,"@coke 84

I agree, The high res movie section is exactly that, high res. if its not a bluray rip of high quality post it elsewhere.

Cams should not be posted here, the only reason you've needed to put that comment in the title froggie100 is because you post these in the wrong section."
,stupidfuck,2012-07-23T12:54Z,"It seems as though many of you do not understand what 720p means.  If the cam was recorded with an HD camera it DOES belong in the highres section, because it is a high resolution recording.  I am surprised this concept is hard to understand."
,ps7825,2012-07-23T16:22Z,"and that message is a coming from a guy named ""stupidfuck"" lol"
,paprboy,2012-07-23T20:14Z,There are screenshots easily indicating that this is no bluray quality. Be happy you can watch this movie without paying for it and in a decent quality. I'm waiting for it to be shown in my local cinema though ;-)
,Segway101,2012-07-24T06:33Z,"Froggie just doesnt get it.  

This guy is malignantly dumb, culpably stupid and thicker than week old shit.  

CAM = SHIT, post with other junk.

Do you get it cunt?"
,FVnerd,2012-07-24T06:42Z,How fucking retarded are you froggie100 this is a cam. This is not a bluray as you said and in now way is this high resolution. Therefore do not under any circumstance post with highres. This is fucking kindergartener knowledge. 
,DjKiel,2012-07-24T06:52Z,wow look at all the haters on this site to all u negative fucks go pay and watch or shut the fuck up its simple its a HD cam so it belongs in the high res section...... maybe go back to school and learn what high res and HD mean you fuck tards 
,djhiney,2012-07-24T10:33Z,"The movie is just out, obviously it's not going to be Bluray quality."
,aiigghht,2012-07-24T12:43Z,"I did pay to see this movie and enjoyed it, I downloaded this to check quality and its unwatchable IMO. (viewed on a 50"" full HD screen with VLC)

Typical cam quality. Confirms that it shouldn't be posted in high res, frame width and height alone don't make it HD ladies. Its considerably less than DVD quality and should have been posted in froggie 100s recycle bin.

,ifurlove,2012-07-24T13:59Z,"BAD BAD BAD Quality.
Cams Quality should not be posted here."
,conny_the_server,2012-07-24T18:26Z,"I personally don't think TS's belong in Highres, put if the recording is indeed 720p, it IS somewhat ""highres"".
It's a homemade movie in 720p, if you will. ;)
 (I'd love a 1080p only section.)"
,kick99,2012-07-25T04:49Z,"Mr. Stupidfuck says it best, because he is indeed a stupid fuck. Everybody, please stand up and provide Mr. stupidfuck with a celebrity FUCK OFF:

If it is not ripped from HI-DEF media source, then it is not hi-def and doesnât belong here. Most cameras/camcorders manufacturers will find ANY way to be able to split their shitty VGA quality image into 1920 x 1080 pixels so that they could call it ""HI-DEF.""  And now that everyone is downloading 1080 from their watches, I suppose we can tell James Cameson to flip out his iPhone to do his filming with, and Mr. stupidfuck canât tell the difference anyways. Village idiots, circus chips, and well-meaning dip-sticks that probably testify to the flavor of yellow snow: No cam rips in the hi-def sections please."
,iampirate2299,2012-07-25T10:30Z,is it watchable? 
,nandos421,2012-07-25T15:36Z,V3/A7
,jdw12327,2012-07-25T19:15Z,Wrong Section.
,jdinho,2012-07-25T19:58Z,"To you people that say that it is in the wrong section, you are the ones that are wrong.

This is not a ""High quality"" section or any thing like that, its ""High resolution"". Regardless the quality of the actual video, 720p is still considered to be a high resolution, therefor it is in the right section.

High Resolution has nothing to do with picture quality, don't confuse the two."
,jdw12327,2012-07-26T07:21Z,"@jdinho You are right, this is a ""High resolution"" section but if everyone posted content like this in this section it would be ruined. I would not use this site anymore.

I should have said ""You are ruining this section"" instead of ""Wrong section"""
,ryballs,2012-07-26T07:37Z,jdinho: You can upscale any source to HD. Does that mean if I upconvert an analog TV rip from the 1980s full of static and shit to a HD mkv that it should go in the HD section? No. Because it's the source quality that counts. People come to this section for genuine high quality HD rips from a HD SOURCE. Files with a shit cam source like this SHOULD NOT GO IN THE HD SECTION. It's torrents like these that will drive people away from TPB because they feel cheated. It doesn't matter if it's clearly labeled or not. PS: You are a douche.
,ThePirateJay,2012-07-28T01:12Z,"Lol...

Short:

HiRes section is for movie that LOOK crystal clear..

THIS IS NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR."
,catalyst317,2012-07-28T02:54Z,"A= 7 (gets fuzzy in a couple of places
V= 7 Pretty good cam
M= 11 (Effin great movie)"
,phuckstic,2012-07-28T08:18Z,"I can see how this generation thinks this is shit quality and after seeing this movie in the theater in pristine quality I agree...however, I grew up watching tv with this kinda quality and it's the movie not how hi res this is that says THIS is watchable...if you are some punk ass teenager who grew up with hd then piss off fuckfaces....ingrates I say ;)"
,m4de0f5tardu5t,2012-07-28T12:26Z,"ignore the haters. [a cam not a bluray] its in the title. you wont get much better this close to cinema release unless it gets leaked from the producer

stop ya bitchin, enjoy the spoils

8/9 for a cam. great job on the clean up"
,growop420,2012-07-29T19:03Z,"to all you stupid fucks this movie is in the right section its original source is a 720p and by industry standards 720p is high-resolution no matter what the pic looks like. and to all of yall hating on froggie go fuck yourself, how about you go buy a 5000 dollar hd camera and you upload a better one. if not go watch it in the theater and shut the fuck. thank froggie for all the work and shit you take from little cock gobbling faggots  "
,Dexified,2012-07-30T05:15Z,"Yeah it's a little fuzzy but it still lets you see what is going on and hear it, I watched it in theaters and this isn't a bad cam. People shouldn't complain about something they aren't paying for. For a cam I give this:

A:8
V:8
M:A+

,Rulmarjay,2012-08-01T04:13Z,"I really do not get what people are flaming poster for. A) He/she deserves props for brining HighRes movies shortly after they hit cinemas. B) This section is HighRes section. There is no HD section were only BluRay+ (Retina) quality should be allowed. There is a difference between HighRes and HD.

Also if you look into this websites forum you will see that the mods themselves said that HighRes CAMRips belong in this section.

Also what I personally like is that the author informed everybody from the start (in the title) that it is a CAM Rip. So you will go here ONLY if you want to download. He did not mislead anybody."
,F4WAD,2012-08-01T23:47Z,"froggie100 has already stated that he doesn't upload on the high res section the moderators (or whoever) are the ones that actually move them to the high res section, why? dafuq i know !"
,MannUpp,2012-08-02T00:12Z,"Cheers Froggie for letting us know its a cam, Im an HD junkie so ill pass on this but still much appreciated !"
,SweetResilience,2012-08-02T10:23Z,"I rate everything a 7. But I rate the movie about a 4 1/2-5. I love family guy, the clevlend show and american dad but I expected more from this movie. And I would think Seth could have chosen a different voice rather than peter griffins. They are very similar in this movie. I really only laughed once towards the end but boy did I laugh! Still a good joke, I wish they had made way more jokes like that through out the movie, that would have been hilarious. Worth watching tho. DEFINITELY not for children!!! For one, they show the bear taking a rip from a bong the first time you see him as a grown up. I hope everyone pays attention to this rating! I know a lot of parents dont..... Be warned."
,bvickery,2012-08-03T11:52Z,"God people are dumb.......I scroll through all the High def files and I see countless retards bitching and complaining about cams that are high def format but not what they expected so they feel dumb for downloading it....and in turn take their frustration out on the rest of us ""smart"" people by trolling the comments......to all you miss informed retarded peon fucks.......FUCK YOU. Quit while you are ahead and leave the format categorizing to the people who know how it works.  .............PLEASE REALIZE THAT YOU ARE ALL MAKING YOURSELVES SOUND LIKE MORONS AND ARE NOT MAKING ANY KIND OF POINT THAT ANYONE GIVES TWO FUCKS ABOUT...... thoughs of us who know what to look for in these torrents are all sick of having to read through all your fucking dribble to find the info that we want....go back to school you ignorant FUCKS."
,[khemist],2012-08-03T17:39Z,"this is a LEGIT cam!!

9/10 (for a cam)
7/10 (overall)

seriously...it is an obvious cam but is VERY watchable."
,[khemist],2012-08-04T05:53Z,"FYI, I get a Cinavia error with this when I try to play it on PS3.  Streaming to a media server solves the problem."
,Kanegasi,2012-08-05T12:44Z,"These comments are hilarious! Thanks for the HIGH DEF upload froggie! If anyone disagrees with me calling this high def, then you don't know what high def actually is."
,blanktom,2012-08-07T01:09Z,"Just so everyone is clear, this is not a high res video of the movie Ted.. this is a high res video of a movie screen that is showing Ted.  There's a BIG difference between those two.  As far as cams go,, i'm sure this is really good but that still doesn't mean it belongs in this section.  "
,ifurlove,2012-08-07T12:35Z,"Delet this movie from this section .

Bad quality .

This section is just for high quality , why people can not it?

Why this shirt is here??
At Highres Movies ??
Bull shit up loader."
,xtaigax,2012-09-01T02:22Z,"This really isn't a Highres MOVIE, it's a Highres cam (e.g. recording).
Not really worth much time if you want to see it in HD."
,1232321,2012-09-02T19:07Z,cant you upload stuff that isnt shit?
,ChrisTMS,2012-09-08T10:25Z,"Seriously froggie, you are a faggot and retarded for purposely putting this crap here on a technicality. It may be considered ""high res"" because you stretched the fuck out of 240p garbage, but that doesn't make it a high resolution video. It just makes you look retarded to anyone here who wouldn't lower themselves to even check the cam section. Seriously froggie, post your fail in the correct sectuon abd take your 240p bum buddies with you."
