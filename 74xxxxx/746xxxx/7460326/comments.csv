,GeekHillbilly,2012-07-20T17:03Z,"Leave it to the BBC to make an offbeat  Documentary on a shitty subject like a toilet.Probably funny as hell.

On a related subject,is there a possibility of getting hold of a copy of""The Wonderful world of Dung""? My daughters and myself laughed our asses off over that one,but it seems to have dropped out of sight.Love to get hold of it(With gloves,pun intended)"
