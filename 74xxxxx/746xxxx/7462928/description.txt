This is a COMPLETE Rehab discography/trackography that I've spent MANY years compiling. Not all the songs are in .mp3 format, and not all of them are of the highest sound quality, but I did my best to get every track I could find. There are very few songs that are missing from it, the ONLY songs missing now are :
 
Audio Club : 05 - Move, 10 - The Gift
Brooks Buford : Open Your Eyes, Rhyme Extravaganza, Trailer Lounge, and Argyle Watson & Bougie Barry - Open Your Eyes (unless that's the same as the brooks version)
Steaknife : I Won't Die With You
Rehab : I Wont Die For You, Ozzy, Somebody Somewhere, Something's Going On, Superstar, GA Bitches, Sally Ride, Scared of Change (Live Incomplete), Give Me Respect (Live), Small Town USA (Low Quality Incomplete), Eat Sleep Shit (Live)
