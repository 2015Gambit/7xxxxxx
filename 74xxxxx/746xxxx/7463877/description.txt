In this four-disk set, Sil van der Woerd reveals the entire production process of making Worms, a music video in which Sil integrated live action footage with complex digital sets and characters to create imaginative worlds. The first disk in this set gives a general overview of the entire production pipeline. The following three disks feature breakdowns of different scenes which are fully analyzed and discussed from sketch to the final composition. Sil covers many technical subjects including motion tracking in Boujou, compositing, rotoscoping and keying in After Effects, previsualization, modeling, texturing, digital sets, animation and dynamics in Maya. The combination of behind-the-scenes material, practical tricks and technical tutorials make this set an enjoyable way to learn and absorb valuable knowledge. This set hopes to inspire everyone who dreams of starting their own production and aims to help turn your independent project into a professional production.
