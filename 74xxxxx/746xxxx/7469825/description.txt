Seventy years ago the wealthy Thakur of Neelamghat had an affair with a gypsy girl, and then married another woman. The gypsy girl's dad placed a curse on the entire Thakur family that whenever a male marries, his wife will die in mysterious circumstances after an year. The curse has come true over the years, and none of the Thakurs have escaped it's wrath. The latest Thakur, Prabhat has now come to settle in Neelamghat, and is attracted to the local doctor's daughter, Sandhya Gupta. When Dr. Gupta proposes marriage, Prabhat tells them about the gypsy curse, and both father and daughter scoff at this. They quickly change their minds one night, when they find Prabhat dressed as a groom, getting ready to marry a reincarnated gypsy girl.
