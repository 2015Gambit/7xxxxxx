,DodgeNeonRT,2012-07-21T20:53Z,"Thanks! My cable was out last night and my TiVo couldn't record either showing, with no reruns coming up. Much appreciated!"
,andypon,2012-07-21T21:30Z,Waited this episode with impatience. Thank you very much!
,dreadlocks,2012-07-21T21:38Z,"Audio started out of sync just a little, but then there were commercials!? and the audio got off by further than my video player can cope with.. unwatchable."
,Task12,2012-07-21T21:38Z,DAmn  those japanese 
,Hilpi75,2012-07-21T21:43Z,audio is not syncronized with video   :(
,ScRuCkY,2012-07-21T21:51Z,Sound is bugged!! 
,Hilpi75,2012-07-21T21:58Z,due to Audio not being syncronized to the video this is sadly unwatchable..   posted this minutes ago but my comment is gone??
,HomuHomu,2012-07-21T22:14Z,-0.5 seconds worked nicely for me.
,HomuHomu,2012-07-21T22:36Z,"Edit

Its hopeless."
,Hilpi75,2012-07-21T22:45Z,true    -0.4 seconds works   but into the first commercial break the audio gets more screwed up..  seems like its several seconds ahead of the video..    couldn't get it right with VLC Player
,jorione,2012-07-21T22:50Z,"what an abomination. Audio is all fucked- and it gets worse after each commercial break. ya, I said commercials. wtf commercials? really? This is not a TvTeam quality. Was this out sourced to a blind-deaf mute in nee of a job? Do not download."
,celik4146,2012-07-21T22:51Z,-0.200 s worked for me
,jorione,2012-07-21T22:54Z,"How getto is this. Open two instances of the file. Play one for audio and other for video. You can hear when the commercial breaks and go to whale wars.

You can try to sync the audio but it gets past 120 seconds out of sync and crashes the player."
,Snowwie888,2012-07-21T23:21Z,"Very very bad audio out of sync after the first (of five!) commercials.

In about 10 minutes I will post a repack of this version, with audio synced, and without commercials. "
,luizsal,2012-07-22T00:01Z,"Unfortunately, unwatchable. Audio is not in sync.
Definetely, not a TvTeam quality job."
,davjoh1,2012-07-22T00:09Z,First part out of sync about -0.4 then about 40 s increase with every commercial break (maybe except one) ending at 160 s out of sync.
,Random-User,2012-07-22T00:42Z,"TvTeam are twats,spam shit up without even seeing if it is any good or not even seeding things till complete."
,maxman007,2012-07-22T00:43Z,KUULE MUNN!!!!! MIDA VITTU SA SIIA OLED TEINUD???? PUTSI LAMMAS:HEY dick!! What the fuck are you doing???? Fuck Sheep:
,Vilpoinen,2012-07-22T00:48Z,"Audio delay after 1st commercial: 39500ms, 2nd: 79800ms, 3rd: 119400, 4th: 160200ms"
,trailblazer666,2012-07-22T00:58Z,Worst video ever. I am disapponted in TvTeam.
,falafelface,2012-07-22T01:01Z,Always thankful for the uploads... but... don't these people ever bother to check this stuff before uploading?
,Wonkss,2012-07-22T01:13Z,Snowwie888  wheres that repack im sure were all waiting for it. I'm sure we all watched up till the first commercails where it was totally broken.
,falafelface,2012-07-22T01:49Z,"new up:

,M-theory,2012-07-22T04:46Z,Worthless.
,Zeagle,2012-07-22T07:38Z,if some spook stabbed me would a whale give a fuck
,educa501,2012-07-22T09:37Z,Audio stops working after COMMERCIALS. yes there is commercials on this one!
,speedingcheetah,2012-07-22T13:50Z,"I posted a webRip..that has audio in sync:

,atticus18244,2012-07-22T16:16Z,Audio and video synching end up way off by about half way through.
,lsivret2,2012-07-22T21:43Z,"first bad torrent i've downloaded from TvTeam... usually they are so good but this one not only has the end of the previous episode, but has commercials and at one point the sound is about 3-4 minutes out of sync.  "
