All you really need is:

One Male-Male VGA cable
(also called 15-pin D-Sub)

One 1/8-inch Male-Male headphone cable
(also called 3.5mm Tip-Ring-Sleeve)
=====

If you use a desktop computer, you may need a DVI-to-VGA adapter for your video card's output.

No HDMI cables/headaches necessary. No HDCP, no DRM issues.

Virtually every display has either a VGA connector, or a connector that can adapt to it; such as DVI; DisplayPort; or plain old fashioned Component RGB
(also called Red Green Blue RCA connectors, like on a DVD player)

If you need an adapter at either end, you can also buy a single cable with the appropriate connections at each end.

All very cheap, check out sites like Monoprice (or Amazon!) for cheap cables of almost any kind.

HDMI isn't so great.  Plain old VGA connectors can carry any resolution your display can support & there are no ""handshaking"" or other DRM issues."
