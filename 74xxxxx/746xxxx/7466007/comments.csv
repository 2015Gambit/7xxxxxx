,rcr29budcar,2012-09-02T05:55Z,"The things in this video are a little too far out there, and allot of it is made up. But the fact is that this country is in worse shape than when Obama took office, and if he gets another 4 years we probably will be more like a socialist country than a democracy!  You can not, with an honest and humble heart say that Obama has been a good president, and that he deserves another term.  If you do, your a hardcore leftwing radical who has been raised to think that conservatives are evil, and you just can't accept the fact that your candidate has failed and is NOT the man for the job! Community organizer! Yeah right.  If he had brain one he would open up the oil pipeline. That would create enough jobs, and lower gas prices enough that he would definately win again. Thank God he's not smart enough to do that.  Now, all the hardcore radical liberals can go ahead and start flaming me and giving me numbers and stories, that you have NO proof of, to let me know how misguided I am! Show me the ""right"" way!"
