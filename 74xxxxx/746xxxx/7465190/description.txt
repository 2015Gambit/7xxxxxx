From the IDW Press Release:
 
A first in the companyΓÇÖs history, IDW Publishing is proud to announce INFESTATION! Starting in January 2011, INFESTATION will infect Star Trek, Ghostbusters, TRANFORMERS and G.I. JOE comics with zombies, zombies, and more zombies. Kicking off January 2011, fan-favorite writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning (The Thanos Imperative, Legion of Super-Heroes) and artist David Messina (True Blood) begin this multi-dimensional saga with INFESTATION #1. This initial 32-page story begins in IDWΓÇÖs own ZOMBIES VS. ROBOTS universe, where something goes terribly wrong and ultimately infests  the worlds of TRANSFORMERS, STAR TREK, G.I. JOE, and GHOSTBUSTERS with zombies and infected robots. From there, the story spins ferociously into each of the four properties throughout February and March, and culminates in AprilΓÇÖs bombastic finale, INFESTATION #2.
The adventure continues in February with TRANSFORMERS: INFESTION #1 and #2, and STAR TREK: INFESTATION #1 and #2. Each bi-weekly series pits star characters against hordes of the undead, courtesy of major comics creators.

ΓÇ£Infestation is the culmination of many months of planning, running through various what-if scenarios and basically looking for ways to upend our many established universes,ΓÇ¥ said Chris Ryall, IDWΓÇÖs Chief Creative Officer. ΓÇ£All for the greater good of telling an exciting, multi-layered story and building toward new developments in the future, of course. Even if the affected characters might not agree with meΓÇª if they were still able to, that is.ΓÇ¥

Helmed by Scott and David Tipton, STAR TREK: INFESTATION follows the growing zombie epidemic to a Star Fleet colony, where Admiral Kirk, Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy must save the day. Artists Gary Erskine and Casey Maloney make the most of this undead tale, with covers by Maloney and John K. Snyder, III. Look for STAR TREK: INFESTATION #1 on February 9th and #2 on February 23rd.

TRANSFORMERS: INFESTION brings an epic battle of machine and mayhem, written by INFESTATION architects Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Zombies and TRANSFORMERS converge in Las Vegas for the biggest show in Sin City. TRANSFORMERS artist Nick Roche captures every gory detail, and is joined on covers by John K. Snyder, III. Get ready for TRANSFORMERS: INFESTION #1 on February 2nd and #2 on February 16th.

IDWΓÇÖs INFESTATION continues in March as the ravenous hordes spread to the worlds of the Ghostbusters and G.I. Joe. Writer Mike Raicht and artist Giovanni Timpano team up for the bi-weekly G.I. JOE: INFESTATION #1 and #2, while writer Erik Burnham and artist Kyle Hotz master GHOSTBUSTERS: INFESTATION #1 and #2.
