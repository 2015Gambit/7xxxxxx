The version of this torrent I loaded up a couple of hours before this one had a problem with one file (08 - Dollar Bill Blues.mp3). As a result the download could not be completed.

This version (hopefully) corrects this.


The hash has changed, so this is a different torrent. But only the affected file has been replaced. So save the files from the first version of the torrent and download over top to save time.

Very sorry.
