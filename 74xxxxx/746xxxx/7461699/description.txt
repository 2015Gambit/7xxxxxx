lyrics
We know what you want
We know what you need
We are the corporation
and we run your favorite
radio station
so give us something good to eat

But don't shy away
(don't shy away)
Don't shy away
Because you
Need us too

Swallow
Up the river
so it can deliver
all of its seeds

We've got profits
you can't keep
We've got pills
so you can sleep
we are the factory
slave to the tiger
that bares its teeth

But don't shy away
(don't shy away)
Don't shy away
Because you
Need us too

Swalllowwwwyadayadayaday

Serpantine in the grass
too deaf to listen
liberating is the venom
that frees its captor
from its prison

And I cannot
see the sky anymore
the bottom floor's at war
with the roar of an animal
and I am stuck here
watching the smoke and mirrors
in a shopping mall
