CANCÚN does not need any presentation, everyone knows Mexico through Cancún.

This scenery took a lot of time of developing and to implement the latest technology in order to make this new scenery fully FSX Native, adopting all the FSX features in this scenery without sacrificing the overall performance.

This scenery includes the latest modifications made from ASUR (Airport operator) to the real airport.

We have dedicated enough time for modeling every part of the airport, terminal, jetway, building, trees, jungle, vehicles and every object of the airport .

95% of every object in the real airport is modeled and included here but, due our advanced techniques and technoligies this does not impacts on the scenery performance.
