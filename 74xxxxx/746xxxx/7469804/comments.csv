,TxJag,2012-07-24T16:25Z,Your welcome CP. If you interested I will be uploading my Calibre Library again. I've gotten a LOT of good books. I just wish I had the time to read 1850 books lol.
,bjmassni,2012-07-24T23:20Z,"Thank you, you upload awesome stuff!! Could you get John Verdon's new one ""Let the Devil Sleep""?

Brandon"
,TxJag,2012-07-25T15:58Z,@bjmassni It's all about what I can find. I only purchase a small handful of books when I want to complete a set. Others I usually find through other online sources.
,ogbeach,2012-08-05T20:12Z,"Hi Tx..  Do you have The Jefferson Key by Steve Berry?  Cant seem to find it.
Thank you"
,TxJag,2012-08-05T22:29Z,@ogbeach Check my Calibre Library torrent. It has complete bibliographies of plenty of authors.
,bjmassni,2012-08-10T22:26Z,"Thanks :)
Can you get The Prophet by Michael Koryta?"
,TxJag,2012-08-11T06:22Z,@bjmassni I've got that. I will upload it in a bit. I need to get a new tracker haha.
,TxJag,2012-08-13T06:42Z,The Prophet is now live.
,And2p,2012-08-15T14:28Z,"Thank you very much TxJag. This came out quickly.

Anyway you can get: The Yemen Connection &
Alliance of Evil by M.H. Sargent???  :)"
,TxJag,2012-08-15T16:45Z,@And2P I'll give it a try. Give me about 24 hours.
,And2p,2012-08-15T17:08Z,@TxJag ... Thank you :)
,And2p,2012-08-21T01:08Z,No luck?
,TxJag,2012-08-21T07:32Z,"@and2p No luck, short of buying the books myself but as of right now like I pointed out I limit myself to what I want personally. Sorry. I will keep an eye out elsewhere but likewise. No promises will be made."
,fuctyou,2012-09-17T02:24Z,Thank You.
