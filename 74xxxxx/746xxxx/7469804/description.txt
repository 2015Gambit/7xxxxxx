A stunning masterwork of action, intrigue, and ingenious plot twists.
#1 New York Times bestselling author Brad Thor returns with his most explosive thriller ever. Somewhere deep inside the United States government is a closely guarded list. Members of Congress never get to see itΓÇöonly the President and a secret team of advisers. Once your name is on the list, it doesnΓÇÖt come off . . . until youΓÇÖre dead.

Someone has just added counterterrorism operative Scot HarvathΓÇÖs name.

Somehow Harvath must evade the teams dispatched to kill him long enough to untangle who has targeted him and why they want him out of the way.

Somewhere, someone, somehow can put all the pieces together. The only question is, will Harvath get to that person before the United States suffers the most withering terrorist attack ever conceived?

Looking for his other books as well? You can find them in my Calibre Library torrent, which will be out of date possibly this weekend. I've added 500 more books to this list.
