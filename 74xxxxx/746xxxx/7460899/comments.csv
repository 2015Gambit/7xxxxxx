[T],Knaster,2012-07-21T00:41Z,Not really germany's high water mark. Kursk was more decisive for the continued offensive capabilities of Germany on eastern front. Stalingrad was a meatgrinder for both sides and a moral victory for Russia. Kursk on the other hand was a major victory for russia both morally and logistically considering all those lost veteran units both panzer and infantry wise lost by the germans..........Just saying
