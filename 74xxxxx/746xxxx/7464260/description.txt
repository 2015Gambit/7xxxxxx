This time Max and Stacy discuss the Irish government being so terribly 'embarrassed' that they hired two dirty bankers to 'clean up' their financial system and they remind David Cameron over in 'Grim Britain' of the 'dreadful backgrounds' of Bob Diamond, Jamie Dimon and their ilk. In the second half of the show, Max talks to Wolf Richter of the Testosteronepit.com about the wine bubbles and where money goes to die.
