You epitomize :the worst of leeches.  You ask the UL'er to list the books because you can't be bothered to look at the ""Files"" link near the top of this webpage.  Then you don't have the courtesy to thank Aziz.

Meanwhile... thanks Aziz and +1 for your quality contribution in a world of takers.  I'll re-seed for a week, tho there's little peer demand considering your more recent UL's."
