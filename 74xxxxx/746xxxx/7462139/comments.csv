If the game keeps crashing on dual-core processors when entering ports:

On the compatibility tab of the PortRoyale3.exe check:
 - Disable visual themes
 - Disable desktop composition

Enjoy and comment!

,hotriceguy,2012-07-24T13:07Z,"I gotta problem!
After I install this update, a window blinks up and requires me to put the product code in. I uninstall and reinstall it with blocking AppData.exe but the window still shows up? How should I do?"
,Smart-The_real_one,2012-07-24T15:27Z,"@noe
If i had it, i've already been uploading it – you can count on that!

@hotriceguy
How did you block AppData.exe?
Using your ordinary firewall?

You have to block it using your hosts file (%WinDirsystem32driversetc).
Use a keygen also.

If you already have starting it, without blocking it first, you have to completely remove it (also registry stuff manually) and reinstall it.

After that, just install it and install over the given patch – and you're fine.

Remember to block it (AppData.exe) BEFORE you reinstall the game, since it automatically starts up after finishing the install process.

So, just append the following in your hosts file:
'127.0.0.1 launcher01.kalypsomedia.com'

I'm just a newbie to computer. I block the AppData.exe through Windows Firewall. I have no idea how to block it through the host file and also how to delete the registry file manually. Please give me some tech tutorial or steps, Thank You! =)"
,Yakuzha,2012-07-24T23:33Z,"@hotriceguy: The easiest way to block it from going online for sure is to pull your LAN cable / internet connection off altogether.

@Smart-The_real_one: Can we expect you to crack the English version for us? :) Thanks before . Dang... it was so close ... too bad i can't speak Germany :D"
,noe_01,2012-07-25T01:36Z,"@Yakuzha
I think we dont need the crack.
We only need the (official) update."
,Yakuzha,2012-07-25T10:21Z,"@noe_01: Yea, the cracked English official update. :)"
,Smart-The_real_one,2012-07-25T15:38Z,"As noe said, you don't need a crack.
Just block the launcher using your hosts file – which i already tried to point out before.

I keep an eye out for it the whole time, but nothing really pops out somewhere …

If i find it somewhere ('PR3_EN_1_2_0.msp')  i'll raise alarm for sure.

,overlord25,2012-09-18T12:06Z,"we still need the 1.2 update in English. Anything new?

thx"
,Smart-The_real_one,2012-09-18T14:55Z,"As i said, if i find it somewhere ('PR3_EN_1_2_0.msp') i'll raise alarm for sure.

No sign in sight.
