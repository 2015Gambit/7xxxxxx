I would like to ask that if anyone wants me to torrent any specific Christian music, they ask me in my current torrent threads.  With well over 1000+ torrents here on Pirate Bay, and counting, I don't often revisit my older threads.  So requests posted in such threads would become lost to me."
,mizzkawa,2012-07-23T22:11Z,thank you so much
,Weston0175,2012-07-24T03:14Z,"lol, so I take it you didn't get my earlier request?
