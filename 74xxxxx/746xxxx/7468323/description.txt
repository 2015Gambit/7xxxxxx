Optimized for MacBook Pro with Retina Display

View full 1080p HD video ΓÇö while you edit.
Final Cut Pro X has been optimized to work beautifully on the all-new MacBook Pro with Retina display. YouΓÇÖll get four times the pixels of a traditional display, so for the first time on a portable computer, you can view your video in pixel-accurate 1080p HD right in the Viewer and see your editing workspace onscreen at the same time. Text appears ultrasharp, making it easy to read clip names and important metadata. And thumbnails are crisp, so you can see extra detail when browsing media, editing in the timeline, and switching between multicam shots in the Angle Viewer.
