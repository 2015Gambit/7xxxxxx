,tim637,2012-08-02T23:33Z,"I see that its optimized for retina screens, what im trying to find out is if you dont have one how negatively will it effect the product."
,theeeDJ,2012-08-06T01:20Z,"This is 100% working for me. My Mac's Software Update wants to update this with ""Final Cut Pro X Supplemental Content 1.0 (637.2 MB)"", but I keep unchecking it. Should I go ahead and download the update?

Thanks uploader!!!!"

,samuellv,2012-08-24T04:49Z,"Anybody else having a problem with the preview of sounds? Every time I hit the little play button to preview a sound, no matter where it's from (iTunes, Logic, or FCP), it just wouldn't play. I'm thinking it's a glitch on this cracked version."
,carlos7ver,2012-08-27T13:19Z,"Muy buen aporte!!!
Gracias"
,barton101,2012-08-28T23:02Z,"@delaltar:
Look for ""Final Cut Pro"" on the disc image. Copy it to your applications folder. Double-click on the copy in the folder in future."
,barton101,2012-08-28T23:07Z,"This download is not the installer. It's just the Final Cut Pro app. It doesn't contain the extra installations. An example is /System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeMPEG2.component. QuickTimeMPEG2 is automatically. installed by Lion and Mountain Lion, but that installation doesn't work with video editors like MPEG Streamclip. I've been looking just for the QuickTimeMPEG2 that Final Cut installs.
Maybe I'll try the Final Cut trial for what I need."
,barton101,2012-08-28T23:08Z,"This download is just the Final Cut Pro app. If you need system files for it too, you need to get the Final Cut Pro installer. People seem to be saying, the app works on its own, though."
,barton101,2012-08-29T04:46Z,"Oops, my mistake. Final Cut doesn't have an installer any more."
,V.A.S,2012-08-31T22:25Z,"Hi , i am currently using a cracked version of 10.0.0...if i download this version and install  it will i lose all or any of my current events and projects. Lot of important work in there, so just wanna check. Please let me know"
,redhealer,2012-09-08T07:42Z,"Thanks for the upload, looks great on my Retina display and can't wait to try it!"
,PREDATOR95X,2012-09-19T07:02Z,"Thanks, works perfect"
