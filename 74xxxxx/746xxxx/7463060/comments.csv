,B.Torrents,2012-07-21T20:04Z,Thanks Maherz...
,extracube,2012-07-21T21:10Z,Just wondering why this is 1.6mb when a couple other versions are 3.68 or so.  Asking because I prefer to d/l from Maherz.
,nileshtambe,2012-07-21T23:17Z,"thanks maherz

its rar so size is less once u unrar/unzip 3.64 MB "
,xpmule,2012-07-22T10:18Z,"be careful with those images

I always check my dvd's after burning
and i burn at the lowest speed and i found a huge problem with downloading the Digital River version of Win7 x64 w/SP1 (Media Refresh)

Basicly no matter what i did setup would fail with a common error code during setup (during expanding files)

See my uploads for Cdcheck. I used that to verify my disc and also inspected the disc with my eyes, and i also re burned the disc image and verified the md5 hash too
I'm 101% convinced there is some kind of problem with that D.R. ""Media Refresh"" .iso
I went back to using by msdn(from wzt) disc and i had no problems at all !"

,extracube,2012-07-23T17:46Z,"niles and undermaker, thanks for responses!

thanks also for links."
,Fuzakenaideyo,2012-07-26T20:44Z,"Thanks, but it no longer works. Evidently, Windows, through an update, has figured out how to beat this. After all is done, the black screen and the warning remains. "
,duriotic,2012-07-27T13:26Z,"@Fuzakenaideyo:  We can safely disregard this.  Mine was activated months and ago and is still going strong.  Still activated, still taking updates.  All I can think is that you must activate FIRST, and not have used any other types of activators before."
,dac1949,2012-07-28T07:06Z,"works fine!
thx for up/share"
,nooce,2012-07-28T08:10Z,Works fine! :)
,dadas,2012-07-28T18:39Z,"Even after successfully installing this,it says that my windows is not activated.I can update windows though.Should I activate windows through the Control panel?"
,yz-seeds,2012-07-28T18:50Z,"@Fuzakenaideyo: Maybe you had installed the Windows Update KB971033... That will detect activation exploits in Windows 7 (AFAIK)
so you better take a look at it in Windows update and never include it in installs, instead just Hide it.
Hope this may helps others. Thanks."
,nabarunp7,2012-08-01T04:23Z,"maherz i m a big fan of yours 
but this torrent has a virus called ""HackTool:Win32/Keygen"" detected by MSE
Maherz pls do something to remove the virus
Thank You"
,Grover_NZ,2012-08-05T06:50Z,Will this work on Server 2012 or Windows 8? http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7503564/MICROSOFT.WINDOWS.SERVER.2012.DATACENTER.RTM.VOLUME.ENGLISH.DVD-
,Tovagulet,2012-09-02T16:40Z,"@nabarunp7

Its just a false positive. Any anti-virus will detect it as a Virus because it edits system files and registry, which is what normally viruses do, but Windows Loader do it only to activate your Windows."
