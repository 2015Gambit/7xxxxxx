I've never liked the idea of DVDrips. I can understand how its useful if there is limited bandwith, but still destroying quality over size makes no sense to me. Here in Finland - and as I've understood same applies for other nordic countries - bandwith has long been very cheap and connections fast. There is no need to try to shove a DVD to a CD. With HDMI and USB slots in TVs the whole concept is also outdated.

Long story short, I'm grateful for what you do. You provide films that have subs in my native language and the video quality is intact. "
