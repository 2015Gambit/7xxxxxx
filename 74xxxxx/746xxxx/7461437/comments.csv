Do you know of any extensive collection of images dedicated to American historyâheroic paintings, portraits, political cartoons, and more recent stuff as well? I cannot seem to find such a collection anywhereâŚin a manner that is easy to handle at least. And I must say you seem like the kind of person who could put such a collection together. It would be a huge favor. Thanks"
