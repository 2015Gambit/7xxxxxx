After an extended hiatus that found the individual members of Beachwood Sparks working on various side projects including forming such bands as the Tyde and All Night Radio, the California soft country outfit reunited for 2012's The Tarnished Gold. An elegiac, blissful, and melodic album.

The Tarnished Gold is not just a perfect album for late summer afternoons, but also Beachwood Sparks' masterpiece. As Gunst sings at the start of the album, "Forget the song that I've been singing/Lay down the weight that I've been holding/Hope that spring melts the winter in my heart," The Tarnished Gold will melt whatever preconceptions you have about the band and leave you basking in the warmth of the summer of Beachwood Sparks' career.
