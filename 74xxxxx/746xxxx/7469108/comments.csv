so to solve this problem 
1( after installing dircetly run the programme 
go to tools --> sittengs --> shell integration
remove the true sign from ""Context menu extension in wendows explorer""
2(if you cann't open the programme or any exe file
go to any text file (Text.txt) 
rename it to (text.res)
run it 
the programme will appear and then do as in first condition
