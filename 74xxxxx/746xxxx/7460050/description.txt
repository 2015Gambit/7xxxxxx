Into that temple walks Alakananda (Tamannaah Bhatia ) who, due to circumstances, becomes a staunch agnostic. Badri converts her into a believer and in the process, without him being aware, becomes the object of her affection. She however doesn't convey the same to him. Her grandfather reveals her past to Badri. Her aunt married a goon called Sarkar (Kelly Dorjee) and that once Alakananda had humiliated her aunt. Her aunt now wants Alakananda as her daughter in law. Badri promises Alakananda's grandpa that he will save her. Meanwhile, Bheeshma wants to make Badri as the head of Takshasila after him. But for that, he has to remain a bachelor all his life. The rest of the story is on how Sarkar targets Alakananda and whether Badri fulfills the promise he made to his Guru Bheeshma.
