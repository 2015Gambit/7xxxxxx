[T],Spetses,2012-07-23T20:24Z,"Browse SomeGuy1999 - I could not agree with you more, The words please and thank-you are unknown to a lot of them.I have a golden rule as to requests.If a person has thanked me in the past then I will do all I can to help.I just ignore most of the others,but I do try to make most people happy.Many thanks on a very hot evening in Greece."
