,faaaaq,2012-07-30T09:20Z,"these C_P rips are horrible....  cropped like a mofo, horrible quality, etc.  i have 1-8 from a GOOD ripper but the good copies are slow to show up...  skip C_P, they suck"
,NTA-Pro,2012-08-02T01:41Z,@faaaaq Haha I don't blame you. But some online anime sites show the episodes with great quality and it's uploaded fairly quickly also and even allow downloading. There's usually more than one way to get something sometimes :P
,faaaaq,2012-08-06T15:39Z,"i know NTA, but I want to have a copy of the series on my computer.  Ive been getting the episodes in HD a week after they air off of Demonoid, but since thats been down for over a week.......lol.  and now i see C_P has the 3 episodes that are left im really bummed nobody has uploaded good quality rips, or at the VERY least, rips that arent cropped to hell"
,noobzor99,2012-08-06T17:47Z,"@faaaaq 

Man, you're right. I was getting the episodes from demoined too at GREAT quality, and now that it is down I have nowhere to get them from, and I seriously hate to spoil the series with shit quality episodes.."
