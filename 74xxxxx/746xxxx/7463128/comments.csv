I'm tired forcing rendered frames to one, downloading a d3d9.dll just for this problem, I've tried disabling antialiasing, FXAA, and the list goes on.

I'm reluctant to buy the game, because this little issue sucks most of the enjoyment out of this game for me, and I don't know if it'll be present in the retail version."
