,ampho,2012-07-24T12:43Z,wouldn't work through my dvd player or PS3 even though it's an avi. Worked fine with VLC player though. Weird
,3raser,2012-07-30T20:09Z,"If you don't like the format of the video, then why do  you repeatedly download the videos that ettv uploads."
,BiigBubbler,2012-08-20T23:24Z,This does appear to be an MPEG-4 pretending to be an .Avi / xvid. ettv is usually great and my go-to provider for avi's now that they are getting hard to find.  Thanks so much for continuing to offer the AVI's ETTV ! :-). I have 4 DVD players that play divx (and not mp4). You can Put this in VLC and look at the codec to see it is MPEG-4.
