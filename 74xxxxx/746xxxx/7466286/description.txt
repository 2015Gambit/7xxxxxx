The Space Within US
In 2005, rock legend Paul McCartney crossed America with his record- breaking, sold out US tour. Now, harnessing the power of more than 25 hi- definition cameras and the thunder of 5.1 digital surround sound, Paul McCartney: The Space Within US captures this epic experience on DVD.
Better than a front-row seat, this feature length concert film takes viewers onto the stage and beyond, capturing Paul's out-of-this-world performance- which was beamed to the astronauts aboard the Mir space station, who woke up to some "English Tea" with Paul and the band through a live feed from the tour.
