
Recorded 10th March 1980. This release 1992 on Original Jazz Classics.

Review by Scott Yanow:
To call this CD (a reissue of a Pablo date) an all-star session would be an understatement. Joining pianist Oscar Peterson, guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Bobby Durham are three classic trumpeters: Dizzy Gillespie, Clark Terry, and Freddie Hubbard. They clearly inspire each other (Gillespie flew in from the East Coast specifically for this date) and the music ("Daahoud," "Just Friends," the new blues "Chicken Wings," and a torrid version of "The Champ") has plenty of exciting moments. Other performances from the same date can be heard on The Alternate Blues, another LP reissued on CD through the Original Jazz Classics imprint.
