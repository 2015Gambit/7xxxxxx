,mx468,2012-07-22T09:32Z,Dear footy. Thank you very much for posting F1 and football. It would be really awesome if you could also post in a format that could be transferred straight to a flash drive and watched on a PS3. For all of those people who are unable to hook up a computer to their tv or projector being able to watch sports on a game console is really nice. MKV can't always be transferred to a different format and be watched via a console. I would gladly donated several pounds a month to you if you posted f1 and man u games in such a format. Thanks mate.

,SerSpec-V,2012-07-22T19:26Z,@mx468: Why don't you take the initiative convert the file to what ever format you want. Several people are asking Footy make custom download just for them. I convert F1 to MP4/H.264 for my friend to play on his PS3. Download a video convertor and stop bugging Footy.
