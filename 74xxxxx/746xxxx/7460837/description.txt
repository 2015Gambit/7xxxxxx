released 13 July 2012


the tracks were originally unnamed on the cd from the factory, and they had no id3 tags. i took the liberty of adding the proper id3 tags and song names as they are listed on the bandcamp page.


enjoy, and support Mr. Hull if you like his music (;





i also want to announce that i play music that is similar to RAGC. if you're interested in getting the upcoming album for free, or if you'd like to donate towards its production, check out my kickstarter project here:

a donation of $1 gets you the album, and if you can't afford that, you can still get it for free later on!


thanks everyone,
