No fillers, just solid Gold these tracks are direct from the Source, which in the case of the real oldies (Pre DVD) would of been Video Tape.  Most if not all are in the correct 4:3 Screen Ratio and the quality is simply the very best you will get for each track.   As we get more up to date, of course the video quality will improve.

I have no idea how many volumes I am going to make up, but I am going to limit each one to around 3GB in size or 20 or so tracks.   All in this series will be MPEG2 VOB DVD format files with a fixed sample rate of 8000 with Stereo Audio of 320kbps.   

I am using super seeding so will appear as a peer in the swarm, or not show at all (depending on your client setup)but to help me in this massive task I am using a 100 mega bit per second seed box as well, so you should get a fast download.

The rate at which I put these up, depends very much on how long each one takes to be seeded by at least 2 other people so I can move on to the next volume.   So it really is up to you to manage your upload bandwidth effectively as you download to give back to the swarm as you go.   During this series you would be advised to never run more than one seed and one download at any one time, unless of course you have a mega 100 mbps UPload AND Download connection like my seed box.

You will notice 3 text files, 1 is this listing the others are a guide to good torrents and for those new to the bit torrent World, a little bit of an explanation about the way Bit Torrent works, and the reason it is simply the best way of sharing a file with many peers at the same time.
