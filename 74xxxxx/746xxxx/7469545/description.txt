Lighthouse Island is a half-hour telefilm produced by Jim Henson.

The show itself was filmed as a pilot for a series that was to center around 
Lighthouse Island, its strange inhabitants and the people that would visit. 
Chris Makepeace was intended to only be a guest for the first episode.

When the show was not picked up, it aired the following year as the second half 
of The Jim Henson Hour's second episode on April 21, 1989.

The source for this release is early generation (but not as early as I'd like).

It is a VHSRip that was dubbed from a Betamax tape.  The Betamax tape was a 
cast member's personal copy.  (I am not equipped to make a BetaRip, sorry.)

(Jim Henson's introduction (the first few seconds) were partially cut off on 
this copy and had to be added from another source.)

I cleaned it a bit, IVTC'd the progressive portion, and ripped the closed 
captioning to add as English subtitles.

Quality is fair, but better than existing rips on the net.

Cover art in BMP and Nero format.

(I seriously considered asking my friend to do an audio commentary track, but 
chickened out.)

Other obscure info:
Lighthouse Island was filmed at Peggys Cove in Halifax.
Jim Henson had seen the location, was struck by its interesting landscape and 
rock formations and decided he wanted to film a show there.

Uncredited anywhere, but the Sea Monster and Tentacle were NOT built by 
Henson's people, but by Industrial Light and Magic.

The Sea Monster was operated by ILM puppeteer Kirk Thatcher who shortly after 
left ILM to join Jim Henson Studios: http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Kirk_Thatcher

Also of note... the polar bear is a costume with a mechanical head and actor 
Gordon Robinson inside.
