===========================================

There, you'll have all the files of DELiRiUM release inside a .ISO file, but you will need only the Hypersonic Content folder.

===========================================

STEPS

1 - If you have any Hypersonic 2 release installed, follow step by step starting from here. If you don't have anything installed yet, you can jump to STEP 4.

2 - Uninstall everything, (Hypersonic player, syncrosoft lincense, syncrosoft H20 emulator, etc). If askS to restart your computer, you can skip that, cause we're gonna to clean all the registry entries related to Hypersonic and Syncrosoft first.

3 - After everything uninstalled, run any registry cleaner software (like CCleaner), and restart you computer.

4 - Now, run the setup.exe file located inside the .rar file that you downloaded from here. It's easy to install, there is no secret, just follow the steps.

5 - After you installed the setup.exe, copy the HYPERSONIC CONTENT FOLDER to any place in your Hard Drive, (for example: C:MyStudioHypersonic Content folder).

6 - We're almost there! Run the "Hypersonic.exe" file (default location is: "C:Program Files (x86)SteinbergHypersonic 2Hypersonic.exe", or Start menu).

7 - When the Hypersonic opens, a pop up window will appear to "set the Hypersonic Content Folder location". Just select the directory that you copied your Hypersonic Content Folder (step 5), and hit OK.

8 - That's it, now have fun!
