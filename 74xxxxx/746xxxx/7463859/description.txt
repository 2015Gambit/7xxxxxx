Dusty Springfield is without any doubt the best 'soul' singer the UK has ever produced.  She started off singing Folk music with her brothers in a 3 piece vocal group called the Springfields, but it quickly became clear that she was strong enough to go solo, and she did producing a string of massive hits throughout the 1960's and early 70's.   In the late 1980's her career was given a boost by the Pet Shop Boys who included her on there hit single 'What Have I Done To Deserve This'

Sadly my all time favourite Dusty Track is not available as a Video so I have included it as an Audio 192bps MP3 'Going Back' is simply an under played almost unknown, 'masterpiece' about looking back over life, something we will all do sooner or later.

However "Going Back" was covered not so long ago by no less a master than Phil Collins.     Enjoy!  Rigmar Radio
