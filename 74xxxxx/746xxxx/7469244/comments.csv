Windows protects the host file in the ETC folder, you need to copy and paste hosts into my documents and edit it there then copy the edited version back to the etc folder. All windows will give you then is the standard admin permisions"

Judging by your name, you dont give a fuck but you don't need to copy anything. You do it the long, stupid, noob way. Just give yourself permission to modify it and/or when you asked to ""open with"" just choose notepad. Simple!
