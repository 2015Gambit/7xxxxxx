,dt7ll5op,2012-07-20T21:32Z,have you recompressed the movies?
,gamester2,2012-07-20T23:37Z,all i did was take the undub version here and follow the steps given to make a dvd 5
,gamester2,2012-07-20T23:38Z,this is what i did and it worked!!!!! were playing now !!!!    http://gbatemp.net/topic/321437-wii-2860-the-last-story-europe/page__view__findpost__p__4117726
,gamester2,2012-07-20T23:39Z,all im saying was there was a few slow parts but nothing i'd pass it up over
,gamester2,2012-07-20T23:42Z,i will be seeding this!!!!!
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-21T16:44Z,"gamester2, i'm interested in the changes you made. i realize, you just followed a guide, but i need the list of files in the iso to compare it with the original iso. i would not download the iso from you -as the initseeder- just for this filelist. could you please make this list for me? the command is: wit files-ll ""THE LAST STORY.iso"" and upload the output to a pastebin-like site e.g. pastebay http://pastebay.net thank you"
,gamester2,2012-07-21T20:35Z,"well i made no changes, the file is here under jmohwk, i took his undub and followed the dvd5 instructions, frankly it seemed to work at a tolerable level but now i am playing the japanese version with no english and i really hate not understanding it, so when i did this i posted it and figured we could all try it together, just trying to share, since i really wish someone would share a dvd5 undub or english dvd5 dub with me"
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-21T23:11Z,"i've made an english(dub) dvd5 rip a day before you uploaded this, but i had to remove some less essential cutscenes, that's why i asked. i suspect, the process you made removed some background music and stuff, because otherwise it couldnt fit on a dvd5."
,gamester2,2012-07-22T17:43Z,"can i pleaseeeeee have the iso? yea i just took the undub of the guy who posted and did all the weird converting steps, but im on level 15 in the jap version and id like to know whats going on ya know"
,gamester2,2012-07-22T19:24Z,is it possible to take the jap version and swap the sound? for english?
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-22T20:03Z,"gamester2, yes, but i have to reinstall the ubuntu-server on my seed server as i switched eth0 to eth1 and back, and it fucked up my gateway configuration in the iptables or pgl or whoknowswhere and now it only sees the lan, not the internet... spent days googling but im noob to network configuration."
,gamester2,2012-07-23T01:04Z,"thanks id really appreciate it, if you want you can just send it to my email. i use a free large file transfer site, i send certain friends movies and stuff, you know the blind type who still buy dvds and never used a torrent site, but its up to you i'm just like wow this would be amazzzzing if i understood the language"
,gamester2,2012-07-25T03:22Z,has anyone got a successful copy from this one?
,tltl4866,2012-07-26T05:51Z,stuck at 66.2% because there is no seed (numbers of seed is 0) by the way will this game work on 3.1j ntsc? (I stored all my games on my hard drive and connected to my wii so I can just load my hard drive when I want to play)
,gamester2,2012-07-27T19:19Z,no longer seeding game was freezing go here for a great copyhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7466464/%5BWii%5D_The_Last_Story_PAL_DVD5-rip
