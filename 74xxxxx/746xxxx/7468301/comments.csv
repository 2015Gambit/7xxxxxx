,Phatfish,2012-08-14T02:41Z,"A/V - Good

M - Fucking epic! No really, it was fucking great. Not exactly what one would expect from a Norwegian movie no one has heard about.

Personally I would NOT go for a dubbed version but anyhow..."

,dean2804,2012-09-14T04:23Z,How the fuck does a dubbed version have more seeders than any other copy? 1006 retards that can't follow subtitles are seeding this.
