,Sallana,2012-07-23T12:26Z,"Mike, try the MP4 she uploaded."
,MandingosTaintFur,2012-07-24T01:42Z,@mad6mike6 what media player are you using? If WMP then download the K-lite codec pack. If that doesn't help try downloading VLC player.
,intoxicatedidiot,2012-07-24T05:25Z,"dont even have to look at it to know it will be good, i dont even like the show only get it for my brother, thanks again"
,genocide44,2012-07-24T13:06Z,"so many have downloaded but arent sharing back ,dont hit and run seed back."
,bdawgnit1785,2012-07-24T17:02Z,mad6mike6 is right tho. something is different from this one than the last 6. its way bigger for one. is 100 mb more than last weeks but only 6 minutes longer this week hmmm....i always throw the eps right on my flash drive and play it on my blu-ray player. the first 6 worked but 7 i had to get elsewhere and will be doing that for the other 5. no point to download something that may or may not work for me. Thanks for the uploads so far this year but i wont be getting 8-12 from you. 
,acthornton1983614,2012-07-25T20:52Z,can anyone not upload this in HD? Unfortunately Demonoid is down and I cant get my usual HD. This is poor quality when you're use to 1080p
,mad6mike6,2012-07-25T22:20Z,"I watch all my movies on a 2 TB Iomega multi-media player. It's like an external hard drive but has an HDMI cable and plugs into my TV all by itself. No XBox or PC needed because it has it's own little operating system built in. Remote too. It's pretty boss.

Mine is a few years old and does not play MP4 unfortunately or I would try xCrazy0328x's MP4 upload. So I'm not using a media player on my PC, it's the hard drive that gave me that error message and it didn't have that problem with xCrazy0328x's 1-6 episodes."
,mozanabi,2012-07-29T17:43Z,"Works for me, didn't give me any error message :) "
,mad6mike6,2012-07-30T09:18Z,I don't understand why it had to be changed after 6 perfectly working episodes.
,camarogb125,2012-07-30T17:43Z,"I had problems with this one, at first on windows media player I wasn't getting nothing but the audio.Took care of that easily enough,but upon storing it on a flash drive like usual I went to watch it on a blu ray player and it said not supported..Downloaded 1-6 and watched them all the same way but I'm wondering as well why it's doing this all of a sudden"
,trixi50,2012-07-31T19:35Z,Thank you!!  Top notch quality!!
