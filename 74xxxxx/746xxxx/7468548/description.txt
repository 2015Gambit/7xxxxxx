2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

This is now the 26th bundle of these Christian Music torrents for 2012.  Downloading all 26 torrents will give you a total of 687 releases to sample.  I pray that you find it in your hearts to support the Artist and their Message by buying the originals, should you like anything you download through these torrents.

There are some great albums in this 26th bundle today.  Kari Jobe has an all acoustic release, KB has dropped an awesome "Weights And Glory" tape, Amber Bullock's much anticipated album is finally here, the always controversial Matisyahu has a new reggae release, Group1Crew has teamed up with Chris August for the "He Said" single that I've finally been able to find, Hillsong College came out with their very own worship project, and I've been playing the gospel and soul sounds of BJ Hardy since I added it to my own personal collection a week or so ago.

More specifically, the 25 titles in this 26th bundle include...
