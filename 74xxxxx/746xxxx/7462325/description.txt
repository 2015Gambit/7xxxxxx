[Software INFO:]
================
With more than 2.5 million downloads, FontCreator is the world's most popular font editing software. It has an intuitive interface that allows beginners to become productive immediately and it contains the powerful drawing tools that font designers require to create and edit high-quality TrueType and OpenType fonts.

When you create or open a font, FontCreator displays an overview of all available characters. You can simply add missing characters, or select an existing character, and modify its appearance. You can import (scanned) images of your signature or company logo, or make a font from your own handwriting. With FontCreator you can also fix character mappings, font names, kerning pairs, and at all times you can preview your fonts before installing.
In the Professional Edition, font validation features enable you to improve the quality of your fonts. Tools to join contours simplify and speed up the glyph design process. Powerful transformation scripts let you create hundreds of additional characters in seconds. FontCreator's intelligent generation of composites allows you to automatically generate outlines for more than 2,200 (mostly accented) characters.

Whether you're a type designer or graphic artist who needs a font creation powerhouse, or a hobbyist who wants to have fun creating new fonts, FontCreator has the tools you need.

What's New
FontCreator version 6 contains many new features and improvements that will benefit type designers, font foundries, and power-users. The most impressive new feature that makes designing fonts so much faster is direct import of vector based images.
