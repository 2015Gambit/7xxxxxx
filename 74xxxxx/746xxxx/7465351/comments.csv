,mike953100,2012-07-22T22:01Z,man ac-3 get outta here.  I am a fellow encoder and you gotta switch to AAC which is far superior
[V],maximersk,2012-07-22T23:28Z,"Dude, AC3 is the original codec ! : )"
,mike953100,2012-09-12T03:50Z,"sorry for hating max.  I take that back.  Although AAC is superior, if the original audio is only AC-3 6 channel @ 384kbit, I would have kept the original audio myself."

I kept the original codec (AC3 with 384kb/s)
