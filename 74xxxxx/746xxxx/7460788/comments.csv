,FVnerd,2012-07-21T17:24Z,From the screenshots this doesn't really look like a DVDR and 4 gb is way too much for a single movie especially if it's only 720p.
,McSatama,2012-07-21T21:08Z,A/V?

,cubstudios,2012-09-10T10:30Z,all your movies are shit. why do you flood the pirate bay with very poor quality cams?
,Scyrthis,2012-09-17T11:14Z,"@FVnerd Way to much? lol, then you must hate quality!

For a good quality and movie experience the 720p movie has to be atleast 4-6gb and 1080p has to be 8-12gb. If you ate big size movies, then download dvd rips or yify movies xD"
