,Danljohn,2012-07-22T01:49Z,"Is this one in sync??
A/V??"
,Random-User,2012-07-22T01:51Z,The actual TorrentDay release of the AFG has ads and most likely same source.
,Random-User,2012-07-22T01:56Z,some shit is hiding comments
,zilexa,2012-07-22T02:52Z,"@TvTeam why upload a bad version? Its even on torrentday.com written in the comments this version is unwatchable because of the worst audiosync issue of the year!

if this IS a fixed/repacked version, you should write it in the info! Now ppl get confused and are waisting bandwith on this shit."
,Random-User,2012-07-22T03:18Z,"Same as killers release, ads and out of sync. Missing start as well."
,falafelface,2012-07-22T03:29Z,"I skipped through it and its pretty much in sync though it does have the commercials.

Don't know if you play it straight threw it will go out of sync but not skipping around. Using VLC"
,falafelface,2012-07-22T03:33Z,"Why do my comments appear, then disappear, then appear later??"
,newcon12,2012-07-22T08:56Z,"I'm about halfway through watching this torrent, it does still have the adverts, but so far it's only slightly out of sync. I put the sync on VLC to -0.400 s and it seems ok! better than the other copy atleast from other torrenteeers on this website."
