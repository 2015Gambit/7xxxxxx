,balaguitar,2012-07-23T20:48Z,Hey Danny. How would I upload a torrent? This might be a silly question. I have never ever uploaded any torrent till now. My main problem is I am not able to select the whole folder. I am just able to select one particular file. For eg. VTS_01_1.vob. U getting what I am sayin?

I followed the instructions one by one. It said that my torrent existed. but unable to find on the server. Not really sure if its existed or not."
