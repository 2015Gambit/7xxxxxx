Dupas asked Miguel Constantino to record the album (as the first album back in 2005), and also some fellows musicians he met on the road starting by Pierre Marolleau, his bandmate of Fordamage, on the drums. From one song to the other, you'll find Jey Vassereau from Pneu, Emilie Rougier from Marvin, Nona Invie from Dark Dark Dark, Mark Trecka from Pillars & Tongues and Dark Dark Dark, Ben Nerot aka The Healthy Boy, Franck Lamamra from Papaye... He also created an untuned ΓÇ£Dude ChoirΓÇ¥ with more of those friends on the song ΓÇ£Japanese TalesΓÇ¥.
