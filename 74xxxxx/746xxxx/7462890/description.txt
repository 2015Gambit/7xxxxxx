Trial sucks,I'll show u how to get the full version.

1. Install pspro_50_3206(trial version).

2. After installation it will prompt u to restart.just click no.

3. Open proshow 5 >>> Tools >>>Download Extras.Just select all and download it all.
If you don't do this you will got 'missing files' problem especially using
wedding style packs.If you skip this step you won't be able to
do it later cause something gonna stop you...trust me.

4. After finish download ,close it.It's time to get the full version.

5. There's 5 item in folder name key.Copy it all paste it to the
installation folder >>> C:Program FilesPhotodexProShow Producer.
Replace all the files.

6. Then click photodex friends,it will prompt u to add something to the registry,just click yes.Don't worry cause it won't effect yr machine performance.This for register.

7. Delete  2 files: proshow.cfg & proshow.phd  to avoid 'illegally use software' watermark on your video.

8. Restart and done.

make sure you copy all the files to the directory "PROSHOW PRODUCER" and not proshow presenter.

enjoy..
