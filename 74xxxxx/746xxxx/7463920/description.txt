Ra-kon-tur - Cocaine Cowboys I

The cocaine trade of the 70s and 80s had an indelible impact on contemporary Miami. Smugglers and distributors forever changed a once sleepy retirement community into one of the worldΓÇÖs most glamorous hot spots, the epicenter of a $20 billion annual business fed by ColombiaΓÇÖs Medellin cartel. By the early 80s, MiamiΓÇÖs tripled homicide rate had made it the murder capital of the country, for which a Time cover story dubbed the city ΓÇ£Paradise Lost.ΓÇ¥

With Cocaine Cowboys, filmmaker Billy Corben ΓÇô whose first feature Raw Deal: A Question Of Consent, caused a sensation at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival ΓÇô paints a dazzling portrait of a cultural explosion that still echoes as Hollywood myth. Composer of the original ΓÇ£Miami ViceΓÇ¥ theme, Jan Hammer, provides the score.
