Colors, 1966
Devout Catalyst, 1992
Upper Limbo, 1994

I ripped them staight from CD's so if you prefer mp3's go right ahead and make some.

I consider "Devout Catalyst" the highlight. It has Jerry Garcia playing beautifully in the mix. Also includes Tom Waites with Nordine. This record grows and grows on you.
