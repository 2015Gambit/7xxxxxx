,4nt1trt,2012-07-25T12:54Z,please notice a/v quality
,tosem,2012-07-26T23:00Z,"It's the real deal, quality is surprisingly OK for such a small size (except for the dark parts, which are, well... dark) but the audio is cam and is quite bad, not to mention it's out of synch in some parts. I'm talking about the English stream, as I don't speak Hindi... Also, its duration is 1:59:58 as opposed to 2:09:01 of The Amazing Spiderman 2012 FULL VIDEO TS - CAM XVID v2 - ARiSE, which means some scenes are missing.

V: 7
A: 3"
