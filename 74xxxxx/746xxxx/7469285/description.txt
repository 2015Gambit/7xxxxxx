Tom Horn - Transhumanism, Science Supernatural Conference:
This lecture, delivered before a reside audience in Canton, Ohio in 2010, is primarily based on research in the upcoming new book Forbidden Gates: How Genetics, Robotics, Synthetic Intelligence, Artificial Biology, Nanotechnology, and Human Enhancement Herald the Dawn of Techno-Dimensional Spiritual Warfare. This investigation reveals for the very first time how breakthrough innovations in science, engineering, and philosophyΓÇöincluding cybernetics, bioengineering, nanotechnology, device intelligence, synthetic biology, and transhumanismΓÇöwill combine to generate thoughts-boggling game-modifications to every thing you have ever before known about spiritual warfare.

How so? In recent many years, astonishing technological developments have pushed the frontiers of humanity toward far-reaching morphological transformation that guarantees in the quite in close proximity to long term to redefine what it means to be human. An global, intellectual, and rapidly-increasing cultural motion identified as transhumanism intends the use of genetics, robotics, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology (Grin technologies) as tools that will radically redesign our minds, our reminiscences, our physiology, our offspring, and even perhapsΓÇöas Joel Garreau in his very best-marketing book, Radical Evolution, claimsΓÇöour extremely souls. The technological, cultural, and metaphysical shift now underway unapologetically forecasts a potential dominated by this new species of unrecognizably exceptional people.
