,GoodGravy,2012-07-22T19:56Z,"The installer is a mess, the spelling in the license agreement spells the word before, as befor, and the intended install path shows that it should be installed in the Program Files folder; instead it gets installed into a hidden folder called virtualroot on the C drive, and to top it off, the thing won't work because of missing registry entries, I ran this in sandbox, so there dosen't seem to be any virus, but still, a pointless torrent."
