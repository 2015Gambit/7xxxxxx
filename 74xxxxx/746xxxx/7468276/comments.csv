,shdwolf1,2012-07-24T17:45Z,"omg, the photographer should be shot or sent to Siberia. The lighting was atrocious, and the outfit and posing terrible. Slowquin made a comment on the smaller size post that this type of ""mood lighting"" style only works with nude. I agree, when I think of the style I picture the intro's to many James Bond films. Those were sexy, sultry, and provocative. These were, well, NOT. "
