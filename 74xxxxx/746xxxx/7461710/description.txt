This is a compilation of Culinary /International Cuisine books I acquired over the years.  It's a testimony of my hours and hours of research in the internet to find these books.  I hope you will like it as I have, and please share it to others as well.  

Some books have died in the sharing community, so I am reposting it to share to other baking enthusiasts out there. 

Enjoy and please remember to seed!
