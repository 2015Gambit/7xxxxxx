Workaholic Jaci van Jaarsveld (Anel Alexander) will go to any lengths to protect the boutique advertising agency she works for from being bought and dismantled by a ruthless businessman known as The Jackal. Hope exists in the form a huge contract for a prestigious wine farming family. But winning this contract wont be simple. Jaci needs to convince the farm owner that she lives up to his companys ideals of family values and commitment by proving that she is in a loving, long term relationship.

Desperate to appear to be living the balanced life she has long discarded, Jaci hires a drop dead gorgeous man she finds standing outside the modelling agency on the floor below her offices to be her fake fiancé for the day.

At the pitch meeting the facade seems to have worked until the client insists her and her fake fiancé JP (Nico Panagio) come away for the weekend to experience the wine farm before she pitches for the contract. Things start to get very complicated, very quickly for poor Jaci, especially since the man she has hired to be her stand in fiancé, is the very Jackal himself who is trying to sink her company.
