PLOT : .................

Meet Bud Howard, an endearing yet unemployed lazy slacker who lives with his mother Mary Jane and younger sister Divine in a quiet neighborhood in Baldwin Hills, California. Bud spends his days day getting high and day dreaming about designing his own wildly successful comic book series. His partners in crime are his best buddies; Jpeezy, Ooley and Pretty Tony, a handful of equally unmotivated characters. Their daily ritual of getting high and reading comic books is put on steriods when the gang finds a huge pile of weed. They can’t believe their dumb luck!. What the foursome learn quickly is that they have unknowingly smoked the stash of the local gang leader and he isn’t pleased. As the weed supply in their area hits an unexpected recession, Bud and his friends look to create some kind of replacement stash and in a hilarious turn of events they accidentally create a “super weed” which puts them right in the cross hairs the local gang….......
