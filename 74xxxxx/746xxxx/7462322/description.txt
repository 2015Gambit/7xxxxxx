In my previous review of the band's "Live At Roulette", I wrote " The music
flows organically, growing as it moves along, with instruments coming and going,
like birds or bees passing by, coming and going, yet all taking part in the
same unpredictable yet not unfamiliar scenery. Despite the apparent freedom, it
all sounds very focused and coherent and it was possibly discussed before
playing, or maybe not, and these four stellar musicians are just so good and so
used to playing together, that this symbiosis of fragile and raw sounds might
have been created spontaneously".

I am not quite sure how to say it differently for this album : the music is
moving without being sentimental. It has nothing of traditional music, yet it
is drenched in familiar sounds that are organised differently, not around
structure but around each other, growing organically, with subtle pulse. It can
be sweet and bluesy ("My Kind Of Poetry", "Old School"), it can also be
adventurous and full of expressive outbursts ("Zero Gravity", "Expert Set")
... and excellent throughout.
