,siomigadjura,2012-07-23T19:29Z,Thank you for saving the avi! :)
,NinpoLore,2012-07-24T03:04Z,"Awesome upload! Because of you, ettv, I don't have to deal with my stupid cable company refusing to carry AMC - I'd go insane if I couldn't catch the new season of the best show on television. The quality of the upload, however, is secondary. The real treat here is the avi format!"
,mart70,2012-07-24T03:54Z,"thanks for the upload, love this show!.. 

@ BuzzDave

@ machspee, don't know what you're using to view your files but i don't see what's wrong with .avi, i watch it on my HDTV using a USB flash drive and it's A okay..."
