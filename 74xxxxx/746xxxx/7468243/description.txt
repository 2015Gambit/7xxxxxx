Our Sunday school classes are held at 10 a.m., and our morning worship is at 11. Bible study is held on Sunday nights at 6 p.m. We have been studying the New Testament on Sunday night since 2004. On Wednesday nights we have special prayer service and outreach. We also have a Bible Quiz Service once a month. Also once a month we have teaching on Bible Prophecy and the Awakening Church.
