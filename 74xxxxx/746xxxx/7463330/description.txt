 BBC Sky At Night Magazine this was the worlds first astronomy magazine - thats not very interesting in itself, but its got some excellent imagery and reviews of all the kit required to gaze at the stars and understand just what is going on up there. Theres also a CD Rom with every issue that'll bring you great sequences and links onto your PC.
