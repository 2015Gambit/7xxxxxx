crime when he was young, leaving him orphaned. Tim always
believed that his father was innocent, and that the antique
mirror that hung in his father's office had more to do with it.
Now grown, he's tracked the mirror's horrifying history and is
determined to prove and document it's awful abilities.
But what he sees and hears in that room could cost him his sanity...
