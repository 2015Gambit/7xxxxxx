Rntheogen - Awakening the Divine within

Entheogen literally translates creating or generating god within, and this ancient knowledge of sacred plant teachers has the potential to transform the world if we can connect with the divinity within and all around. 'Entheogen Awakening the Divine Within' is a feature length documentary which invites the viewer to rediscover an enchanted cosmos in the modern world by awakening to the divine within through the ritualistic use of Entheogens or Psychedelics.

Stan Grof, Marilyn Schlitz, Ralph Metzner, Alex Grey, Terence McKenna, John Markoff, Daniel Pinchbeck, and Kat Harrison among others, postulate how the disenchantment of the modern world may be remedied by summoning the courage to take the next leap in the evolution of planetary consciousness.

The film examines the re-emergence of archaic techniques of ecstasy in the modern world by weaving a synthesis of ecological and evolutionary awareness,electronic dance culture, and the current pharmacological re-evaluation of entheogenic compounds.
