I really want to download this torrent, however I do have a problem:

 I was constantly asked for a username and pw for authentication by http://staging.examiner.com. When I ignored this, there seems to be no files available from this page when I tried to download this torrent.

Could anyone kindly tell me the username and pw, or how do I go about getting it?

Thank you so much!"
