Originally downloaded from TnS, I've decided to at least return the favor by re-uploading them for anyone else who wants to enjoy them.


Note: There is an issue with the BlackDiamond engine enclosed in this torrent which may cause the dialogue to screw up and become unreadable (well, not without great effort). In addition, ESoD's dialogue is not aligned properly, and 10D is not in English, although that's because they never ported the English version.




If you want to review the dialogue, please visit the Touhou Wiki and search for it. They have a transcript of each and every game.
