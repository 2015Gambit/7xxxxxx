NOTE: This torrent only includes episodes #5 through #10. I just uploaded another torrent with episode #2, but I do not have #1, #3 and #4.  If anyone could semd them I would certainly appreciate it, as I'm sure would others.

This was a great show that unfortunately was killed before it's time should have come.  Maybe someone will pick up on this and create something similar.
