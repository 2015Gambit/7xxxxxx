,Sphenisciphile,2012-07-24T05:36Z,"I'll assume your user-name should really be 'grainofsalt'. I am seeding, always do seed until enough leeches become seeds, and I can't control the upload rate apart from allowing max bandwidth, nor can I force/deny connections. When seeding, I only upload 1 torrent, and let Îźtorrent do the rest. So either retract your comment or crawl back under your bridge. I do this for the other Britophiles out there. Just be glad my local public library has such an extensive collection. More stuff in the pipline. Just be patient. An 8 year old Dell laptop with a 1.8GHz single processor & 512MB ram isn't exactly fast."
