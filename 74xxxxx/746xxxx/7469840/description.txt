Well Done for downloading the 1st 4 in this series of, err I am not sure how many.. Volumes of Oldies.   The source is off the net, all of this has been released into the public domain by the original seeders who of course get credit.   I have simple tidied up the tag and title info and made most if not all into VOB or MPEG2 DVD format video's.   So enjoy as they say:
