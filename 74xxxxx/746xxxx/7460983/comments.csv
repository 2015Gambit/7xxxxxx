,Itchiga,2012-07-20T21:03Z,Soo... it is in rus lang? 
,Tema567,2012-07-20T23:15Z,"This installer have only russian captions in some places and license box
Everything doesn't matter because this is original BF2 ver 1.50 with installed Project Reality and RePacked into one setup.exe
Also it provides you some new stuff like CD Key Changer and PunkBuster automated installation.
Everything having latest versions, and could be used on official/ranked servers!"
,Tema567,2012-07-20T23:33Z,"Just try it then you'll see how it works
It's having russian only in some places of installer like captions and license box.
This is original BF2 v1.5 which allows you playing on public/official/ranked servers including GR :)
This RePack faster, easily and flexible than original EA installers /no more nigthmares with patching to 1.5/
Also they're containing most ever realistic and tactical based modification Project Reality v0.973
After the game will be installed you can optionally Enter or Change your CD-Key without validation and install PunkBuster in automated mode. Unfortunately manuals for PRm is on Russian, but you can read it on realitymod.com everytime.
I hope this helps everyone who want to know ""what's inside?"""

settings >> connections >> set all to encrypted.

If your pirating games, you don't want to be caught by the law!"
,Tema567,2012-07-31T20:41Z,we're not pirating games! this client should be used with official license in order to play on ranked servers!
,schlitzlaus,2012-08-08T14:35Z,"hi, i tested this, and there are just a few servers not complaining about a invalid key, even if there is a keygen, but this generates junk that is recognized by EA"
,Tema567,2012-08-15T11:31Z,"keygen generates only random keys which shouldn't be recognized by EA, because EA have their own database with valid keys and it means you can't bypass it, only stuff with free servers should work fine."
,InfoMaaaan,2012-08-19T05:34Z,"Uuuuh You said ranked servers could be bypassed, Not for me. And almost every PR Server kicks me expect some Chinese and Spanish server."
