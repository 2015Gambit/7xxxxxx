What happen with 720p?"
,RadioActiveX,2012-07-30T05:08Z,"You're welcome fellas...

@lilsean like i said in the other post, just don't have the patience to do it all over again in 720p, my computer is not the fastest and it takes very long to encode.  I basically do it for how I like it, and then share it with you all..."
