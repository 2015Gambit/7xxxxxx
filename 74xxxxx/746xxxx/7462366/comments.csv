,extracube,2012-07-21T21:11Z,"Over 5,900 people downloaded this in one day!  Guess I better get it too!"
,xpmule,2012-07-22T10:24Z,"i'm happy with uTorrent v2 !
see my uploads for the last version,
dht patched (hack for private trackers)

and yeah wow that is a lot of seeders
makes me wonder if more people are sick of uTorrent v3 bloated crap ?"
,chop007,2012-07-22T15:05Z,I have never seen this many seeders before on one torrent. Maybe the solar flare added some juice to the system instead of frying it?
,lizardleech01,2012-07-23T12:52Z,"http://download.cnet.com/FrostWire/3000-2196_4-10627624.html 
i wonder why but there is a direct download for this
but im gonna try it!"
,DDOOBLES,2012-07-23T17:30Z,6/10 I prefer using Tixati.
,MCStitches,2012-07-24T06:02Z,Who uses Frostwire? It still accesses the Gnutella network. Someone kill this plague. We have torrents for a reason.
,Yosho2k,2012-07-24T23:48Z,"Yo dawg, I heard you like to torrent so we put a torrent in your torrent, so you can torrent while you torrent."
,ironymon,2012-07-29T10:41Z,"rofl, get utorrent and erase all other trashy p2p sharing programs, theire just virus nests... gee."
,La5to,2012-07-31T04:15Z,This torrent is sponsored by ThePirateBay themselves. Just like that music file at the top of Music category.
,Buttdozer,2012-07-31T18:42Z,"You people do know it has OpenCandy ### adware ### ? Be warned. Over 5000 seeders may be a scam.

Postive reviews on the web (CNet Download and others) are coming from the makers and OpenCandy marketeers. Go do some research if you don't believe me."
,Urvek,2012-08-15T05:57Z," Written in Java and full of gook adware.

Merry Christmas P2P"
,freecall,2012-08-21T07:03Z,this takes over the entire computer with spam etc
,zeeer0,2012-08-23T02:49Z,"Count has a bunch if uploads. none of them made anyone happy, this one wont either."
,adeertehPr0,2012-08-23T16:26Z,"Guys, this is outdated, the latest version is 5.3.8."
