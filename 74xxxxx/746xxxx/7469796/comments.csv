,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-28T00:07Z,if all your torrents are of this bunch of sellouts to disco then please STOP!
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-28T00:37Z,how dare you knock the GODS OF ROCK   what the hell is wrong with you  have apperciation for the kings of rock  KISS  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF  
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-29T00:01Z,"you are correct i have absolutely no appreciation for sell outs they are glam, disco - metal wannabes -  not the real thing. come on lets get real kiss dollies?? PLEASE. if these are your kings of rock, do not stand to close to the fire as plastic melts, just like the dollies, they just want your cash and do not care how they get it. i understand my view may not be popular,but the clue is in my name. remember METALS THE BEST SO FUCK THE REST!"
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-29T19:10Z,"YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AS FAR AS I FEEL ABOUT YOUR NAME IN THE WORDS OF GENE SIMMONS (THE DEMON OF ROCK)  -  BURN BITCH BURN  - AND YOU KNOW WHAT DONT KNOCK SOMEONE FOR COMING UP WITH A GOOD IDEA ON MAKIN MONEY YOU DUMB BITCH ALL THEY DOIN IS MAKIN A LIVIN DONT BE MAD CAUSE THEY THOUGHT OF IT AND YOU DIDNT  AS FAR AS SELLING OUT YEAH THEY SELL OUT ""EVERY SEAT IN THE ARENA  YOUR NAME SHOULD BE ""JEALOUS BITCH "" WHAT ABOUT ""REVENGE "" ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FUCKIN ALBUMS  OF ALL TIME    YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR TALKIN ABOUT  AND YOU SUCK  I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I AM WASTING MY TIME LEAVING A COMMENT TO DEFEND ""KISS ""TO YOU     YOU AINT EVEN ON MY LEVEL SO BACK THE FUCK UP "
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-29T19:12Z,YOU HAVE NO ROOM TO TALK ANYWAYS  YOU DONT EVEN UPLOAD SO #$&@ OFF
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-29T23:20Z,"as i said after hearing the disco kiss which was my first and last experience of them did not even stay to watch them at donnington when they headlined in 96 or 97 forget which. in the immortal words  DEATH BEFORE DISCO ! i agree they sell out arenas so does ricky martin!? i am gonna burn, this bitch is smoking already so not far to go. i do not know why you are wasting your time to defend kiss either. you have uploaded Rob Zombie ( well played!! ) so you know what heavy is as i said my view may not be popular. as for uploading i have not  but i have a plus 2 share ratio 650plus gig so i do my bit, back the fuck up? do not do reverse. the first real metal band to emerge from the states was the one and only MANOWAR ( and they started in the uk ) no comparison really."
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T02:53Z,bitch you aint even on my level  so im gonna stop wastin my time your dumbass
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T03:00Z,"how can you compare the dumbass ricky martin faggett to KISS  and as far as only listening to disco kiss thats your problem  i dont like "" i was made for lovin you "" crap either you should try listening to the better stuff just like on this torrent and 96 or 97  isaid ""revenge"" that would be 1992 sweetie get your fact right anyways like i said YYOU AINT ON MY LEVEL SO YOU BACK OFF"
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-07-30T03:13Z,manowar         really                   god they are the worst band ever to exist you dont no shit about metal try entombed or slayer or cannibal corpse thats metal and dont judge KISS by one album 
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T03:22Z,MANOWAR - ''REALLY ''  NOW I GET IT YOU LIKE STUFF THAT SUCKS   DON'T WORRY SWEETIE  IT'S OK TO LIKE CRAP  BUT DON'T JUDGE A BAND CAUSE THEY MAKE A GOOD LIVING (AND GREAT MUSIC) 
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T03:25Z,"OR HOW ABOUT LISTENING TO SOME ""DISTURBED"" OR  ""KORN"" NOW THATS   NOT MANOWAR  THEY FUCKIN SUCK"
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-30T13:20Z,"firstly to animalizeasylum do not take any notice of my first comment about stopping your torrents i just could not resist it, there is no accounting for taste, people uploading is what gives us things to share, you put your copy out and then it is down to the kiss family to keep it going, and look at the passion you expose. keep it up!
who said i do not listen to slayer, motorhead  , slipknot, floyd, venom, pantera, black sabbath, suicidal tendancies, led zep, down, sod, kreator, metal church, machine head, maiden, priest, soil, drowning pool, megadeth, acdc, stone sour, white and rob zombie and the list goes on and yes MANOWAR all in my playlist, i said they were the first metal band to emerge from the states before slayer, metallica in 83 ( battle hymns 82 ). what i said about 96 or 97 was that i left donnington park ( monsters of rock??? ) and went back to my tent along with a portion of the crowd rather than see the headlining band which was kiss.
what is this level? i did not get it the first time and you seem to be developing a stutter.
loudest band in the world? longest concert ever? no? that is right MANOWAR.  i have no worries about them ( kiss ) making sheds of dosh i just see past the front for them it is a business not the music, next you will try to say twisted sister were great, or poison or motley cotch. stop listening to pop, -  or do not, it is a free world. i know it is ok to like crap otherwise kiss would never have made a penny."
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-30T13:46Z,"it was not one album more like half a track, i think crazy nights?? but when i heard ymca by the village people i did not then think i will go buy their lp and not make a judgement whether i would be wasting my money or not. and what about lip synching at a music festival, SHAMEFULL,  Kiss released the glam metal album Animalize on September 13, 1984 - quoting wikipedia. glam metal is plastic, costume jewellery. i rest my case."
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T14:01Z,MANOWAR IS A DISGRACE TO METAL  AND EXCUSE ME BUT THE FIRST METAL BAND WAS NOT MANOWAR   IT S CALLED ''BLACK SABBATH''   THANK YOU VERY MUCH    AND I GIVE YOU RESPECT FOR MOST OF THOSE BAND TITLES CAUSE THOSE KICK ASS   BUT AS FOR ANIMALIZE BEING POP YOU '' NUCKIN FUTS ''  ANY HOW THIS WORLG PEOPLE GUNNA LIKE WHAT THEY WANNA  VSO FUCK IT 
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T14:02Z,FUCK IT
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-30T15:50Z,"first metal band from the states.
sabbath, deep purple, led zep, hendrix all instrumental in heavy metal starting and all contempories to kiss.
and thanks for sticking up for kiss as i would never have found out about the lip synching otherwise. i just quoted wikipedia they said glam, 84 gave us such as powerslave, ride the lightning and live undead which to me are more memorable.
agreed no accounting for taste and that is what makes things interesting.
in the words of metal church METALS OUR RELIGION WE WILL TAKE IT TO THE GRAVE
and the real metallica FUCK IT ALL AND FUCKING NO REGRETS. (damage inc. not the recycled line in a later album)
 anyway respect for your loyalty and also your uploads, maybe chat again with a less hostile start ( my fault i know).
maybe we can agree that METAL IS THE BEST SO FUCK THE REST."
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T18:06Z,yeah i agree on that    its not my fault you dont like ''KISS''  just like its not your fault i dont like ''MANOWAR''  WITHOUT METAL THERE WOULDNT BE A REASON TO GO ON    
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T18:10Z,BY THE WAY WIKIPEDIA IS NOT ALWAYS CORRECT   AS FAR AS KISS IS CONCERNED THEY ARE NOT GLAM  WIKI WAS WRONG ON THAT  THEY ARE HARD ROCK   I NEVER DID SAY THEY WHERE METAL THOUGH 
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-07-30T18:12Z,ANYWAYS LIKE I SAID FUCK IT
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-30T18:43Z,"BANG THAT HEAD THAT DOES NOT BANG!
keep rocking."
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-07-31T10:55Z,try listening to revenge or lick it up or carnival of souls and tell me its pop crap at least its good music manowar is was and allways will suck they are the worst band i have ever heard 
,tool75067,2012-07-31T16:20Z,"@insidetheelectriccircus 

manowar is was and allways will suck they are the worst band i have ever heard

well you must be deaf! or just butt hurt that KISS is a thing of the past!"
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-07-31T17:13Z,a thing of the past or you high new album comes out in october still rocks you dumbass
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-07-31T17:15Z,you couldnt pay me to sit and listen to manowar i rather shove nails in to my skull than to listen to that shit 
,tool75067,2012-07-31T18:34Z,ya a thing of the past. they haven't had a good album since 85!
,tool75067,2012-07-31T18:36Z,btw you should know whats good considering you released a kesha collection!   LOL DUMBASS!
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-31T20:57Z,"@insidetheelectriccircus 
i had left this with an understanding that there is no accounting for taste and agreeing that METAL IS THE BEST SO FUCK THE REST! but....
you couldnt pay me to sit and listen to manowar i rather shove nails in to my skull than to listen to that shit. 
maybe you should take the nails out of your head they are obviously interfering with you hearing and reading,
when i heard ymca by the village people i did not then think i will go buy their lp and not make a judgement whether i would be wasting my money or not. so why would i listen to anything else by kiss, half of crazy nights was enough.
and what about the lip syncing? for a festival, very... how can i say deceitfull ( trademark kiss ), compare to the world record holder for the longest concert ever, you may not like them but some people ( quite a lot i believe ) stayed around for over 4 hours to watch them LIVE not faking it which seems to be kiss all over FAKE, the band of course MANOWAR. 
may be it is an american thing for kiss as over this side of the pond especially mainland europe MANOWAR kick kiss s arse all over. 
i understand you like kiss ( not why, but that you do ) as i like MANOWAR and each to their own,
i suppose you also like poison, motley crotch and bon jovi and the like, again your choice do not be ashamed it is ok. while us headbangers get to banging our heads you can sing along with i was made for loving you or something. again i am quoting here:-
""Stanley and Child wrote, ""I Was Made For Loving You."" So, ""we made history,"" Child further remembered in Billboard, ""because we created the first rock-disco song."" 
THERE IS NO SUCH BEAST AS A ROCK DISCO ANYTHING. does the phrase DEATH BEFORE DISCO not give a wee clue, i think so, and again i quote :-
Some Kiss fans dismissed ""I Was Made For Lovinâ You"" as a sell-out. not all sheep then.
anyway finally METAL IS THE BEST SO FUCK THE REST and headbangers of the world unite and say FUCK DISCO!
"
,headbanging_bitch,2012-07-31T21:13Z,"i just googled kesha ( like i say me and pop do not get along ), now is the time to be ashamed and go back in the closet. i guess you have kesha wesha in your pretty playlist along with kylie minogue and ricky martin.
i almost took your comments to be from someone who knew what they were saying like DRESSEDTOKILL but i see you are a proper poppy just jumping on the latest bus to arrive and claiming it is the best ever. 
as tool75067said LOL DUMBASS! well said."
,tool75067,2012-07-31T21:27Z,m/
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-08-01T07:25Z,i am animalizeasylum and i put that kesha on there just to mess with people to see what people would do cause nobody would seed the metal thats what i like and my brother is dressed to kill so i know what im talking about i also hate kesha so there if people dont ever seed the way they should and once again manowar sucks ass and try listening to kiss revege album from 1992 tell me one good album that manowar came out with
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-08-01T07:33Z,by the way my favorite bands are king diamond and old metallica with cliff and megadeth and bands like metal church and gwar and slipknot and cannibal corpse and ozzy and kittie and kiss they were the ones who they are the loudest band in the world and the new album is called monster comes out in november also tell me what album by manowar do you suggest to support your band you like so much so ill give a try cause if yet to hear a good one  
,DRESSEDTOKILL,2012-08-01T10:14Z,"NO REAL KISS FAN LIKES '' I WAS FOR MADE FOR  LOVIN YOU '' ANYWAYS   THAT AND ''ROCK 'N' ROLL ALL NITE (IN MY OPINION) IS THE WORSE KISS SONGS EVER  SO BY THROWING THAT DISCO SHIT IN MY FACE IS BULLSHIT BECAUSE I THINK THAT SHIT AINT THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD ANYWAYS  I LIKE ALBUMS LIKE   ''CREATURES OF THE NIGHT '' ,REVENGE ,OR LIKE MY NAME ''DRESSED TO KILL ''  SO YOU GUYS DONT EVEN HAVE THAT BIG OF A POINT REALLY CAUSE THEY AINT ''GLAM'' OR ''DISCO'' JUST BECAUSE THEY GO WHERE THE MONEYS AT DONT MAKE THEM GLAM OR DISCO THAT JUST MEANS THEY MADE ALOT OF FUCKING MONEY    THATS CALLED ''SMART BUSINESS '' NOT DISCO "
,headbanging_bitch,2012-08-01T19:28Z,"old metallica with cliff we can agree on that when i saw them in 95 or 96 again at donnington was just after they should have changed their name to plastica "" now i lay me down to blah blah blah "" was when they started "" going where the money is "" we bought their fucking jet for them. this is a subject unlike kiss that i care about, i wrote tallica a bloody book ( dont know if it was ever read ) saying much the same, ozzy after seeing him in the Ipswich gaumont ( first day of the tour, so he was not knackered from touring just yet ) same year kiss headlined donnington ozzy was also there, fear factory opened and after they came out to see us signed my colours along with Geezer ( best bassist ever with Steve Harris a close second ) when i asked how long ozzy would be i was told "" oh he is long gone "" as soon as the concert was over i lost everything i ever felt for him again we put him where he is and he had no time for us. which is why i never mentioned either in the shortlist of bands.
we listen to a lot of the same shit, try their first "" battle hymns "" or the one that came out in the same year as animalize "" hail to England ""
CAUSE THEY AINT ''GLAM'' OR ''DISCO'' JUST BECAUSE THEY GO WHERE THE MONEYS AT DONT MAKE THEM GLAM OR DISCO THAT JUST MEANS THEY MADE ALOT OF FUCKING MONEY THATS CALLED ''SMART BUSINESS '' NOT DISCO - exactly  business being my point they are not playing what they want only what they can sell, ergo no soul, no heart instead of "" music music music "" it is "" money money money "" so dont con yourself they dont care about their fans just how much cash you have got and how they can get it out of your pocket. MANOWAR may not be as POPular as kiss but they play what they believe in, ( i know you think it is shit ) and have done for the last 30 years no selling out, you do know how MANOWAR started and where?  
led zep outsold the rolling stones without all the propaganda of the latter. they played what they felt not what the masses wanted, the fans wanted what they played.
 if you play disco then you are disco which is pop. you understand the kiss ethos and yet you still subscribe to it.
NO REAL KISS FAN LIKES '' I WAS FOR MADE FOR LOVIN YOU '' ANYWAYS THAT AND ''ROCK 'N' ROLL ALL NITE (IN MY OPINION) IS THE WORSE KISS SONGS EVER : question:- have ( for example ) slipknot ever "" GONE WHERE THE MONEY IS "" i think not. the money is where they are, as with led zep, it is the music that is important not just getting your money.
how come you or your brother do not say anything about the lip syncing or do you think that is ok?
that by itself for me is enough to kill a band imagine king diamond syncing "" abigail "" or the real metallica syncing damage inc."
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-08-02T00:16Z,i dont know why you keep bringing up pop and disco cause kiss wrote 1 disco song back in 1979 and pop when pop was so called good i never got into pop crap nbut the kiss that i know and like is the harder albums ozzy went pop too so as metallica and megadeth for that matter just cause they go mainstream cant knock them for it someone offers you millons to sell out you would take it to they still came full circle and still rocking after 40 years new album in october and if you like manowar so much i got a dvd for you want it also did you check out the new torrants i posted last night they seem to be seeding quite well so enjoy why dont you email me its easier 
,insidetheelectriccircus,2012-08-02T00:32Z,let me know ill post that manowar disc for you if you dont already have it and let me know what else you would like me to post and ill try only if you try to listen to the heavier kiss albums 1st like revenge or destroyer or asylum or animalize or creatures of the night 
,headbanging_bitch,2012-08-02T20:01Z,"well played like the priest/halford although no one seems to be listening to your request to seed at the moment 0. sorry it took a while to get back i have just finished burying one of our dogs ( got 16 now, 13 abandoned  ). i agree ozzy and plastica have sold out did not really find that with megadeth ( but i have not listened to the radio since 88 or so ) pop was never good. giving unholy a listen at the moment ( you tube ) are you sure you do not like MANOWAR ? while it is better than the half a song i heard before it sounds like someone else ( i will remember in a mo ) ozzy and tallica would never have had the chance to sell out if we had not bought their earlier stuff and that is the pisser  i guess me and a few others feel used now they seem to have forgotten us, the difficulty in getting their records in africa in the 80s was not easy i can tell you, they wanna sell to the pop brigade then they can fuck off and do just that. the strange thing is ozzy sabbath still rocks. although when i saw them in 94 at the hammersmith odeon they fucking rocked dude, and would not have been better with oz.
aerosmithish ( unholy ) who are quite cool in small doses ( i know mainstream but original ).
so while i shall concede that not all kiss is pop i do not think they will reach my playlist aerosmith are only there with a greatest hits and not the whole album. war machine playing you tube just started and again sound like someone else they are trying an ian gillan sabbath also with a touch of priest so this one you could quote me as saying it is ok pretty cool but again have gillan have sabbath have priest so no need ( i am listening as i type and such  sabbathy riffing but not quite ) how do i email you it would as you say be easier, i do more listening at my computer while i do my images as it influences my input as opposed to watching vids. i am busy taking kd and jp. and shall seed my normal ( plus minus 2 ratio ) so let me know how to email you, i can then give you my site address and if there is any sort of graphic or photo stuff done i can repay you for your torrents."
