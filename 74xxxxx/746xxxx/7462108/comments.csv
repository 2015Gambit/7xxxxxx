Reading might help..."
,jumjumb,2012-07-21T18:21Z,A .raw-file!? I believe this is useless ...
,oldnapalm,2012-07-21T18:39Z,"It can be useful if you can read description:
Use ""SUSE Studio Image Writer"" to write bootable USB from Windows."
,qskenzer,2012-07-22T05:56Z,"I love the way some people think something is ""useless"" just because they're too ignorant to know how to read! Oh, and maybe try this new thing called Google once in a while.
This is a great find! It worked nicely on an HP laptop I have...no audio or wireless device detected but other than that it's Mac OS  on an X86 laptop just like the title says it is."
,czyberx,2012-07-23T06:11Z,"This took me only 10 minutes to install,
installed NullCpowerManagment, FakeSMC,kext with kextwizard, then Chameleon v2.1svn r1923,
and done, it booted by itself.
ThanX for this Unique Upload.
Now I,m up to install all other kexts  (multibeast)"
,newberemis,2012-07-25T04:23Z,"I have a ASUS P8Z68-V LX and my problem is that when I click on shutdown in Mountain Lion GM, the system shuts itself down but then restarts in a moment. So it's like a restart instead of a shutdown.

Does anybody know how to fix this issue?"
,oldnapalm,2012-07-25T16:29Z,"Confirmed, App Store build is the same as GM (12A269)."
,salmanlse,2012-07-25T17:09Z,"hi i am new to installation of osx on pc.

installed NullCpowerManagment, FakeSMC,kext with kextwizard, then Chameleon v2.1svn r1923,
 and done, it booted by itself."
,joeche77,2012-07-25T22:33Z,"Does this make it unnecessary to follow the Tony Mac Procedures for the install- here:
http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-1-5-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html

Then we should probably run the MultiBeast?"
,Olarila,2012-07-26T00:27Z,JUST FORGET THAT TONYMAC... AND UNIBEASTS ALSO... THERES NO NEED... ITS FOR STUPID PEOPPLE...
,nelperez,2012-07-26T04:19Z,I get a boot0error. How do i fix?
,oldnapalm,2012-07-26T07:19Z,"Did you use ImageWriter to copy raw to USB?
