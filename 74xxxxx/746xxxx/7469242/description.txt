I would like to thank ThaKilla for creating this wonderful program. I'm just uploading this so people can edit how much ammo a gun carries, how the gun is held, how much damage it can do, edit what cars people use, etc.

I'm uploading this because the people may want to edit the stats to make the guns more realistic, make the prices of anything 0$, etc.
