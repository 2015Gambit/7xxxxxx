The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

Today, Sunday, July 22, on a special edition of Infowars LIVE, Alex and team will break down the classic earmarks of a staged false flag for self-inflicted wound via Colorado. Alex also examines the history of documented and declassified staged terror attacks committed as pretexts to launch wars, enslave populations, and ultimately so the criminal establishment can pose as heroes.
