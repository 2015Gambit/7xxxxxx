The Private Life of...
Jimmy Doherty investigates the hidden lives of the farmyard animals which are so often taken for granted


1)  Cows 
He visits a farm in Devon to find out about cows. They are taken for granted but what really goes on inside their brains? Jimmy tries to find answers to questions such as how does a cow work out who is the boss? Why have 1,000 people been injured by cows in the last ten years? And why are cows so sensitive to sudden movement? The show will also visit Chillingham Castle in Northumberland, where a herd of cows has been left naturally to run wild for over 700 years. Are cows really "one of the most successful species on the planet"? If you define success in terms of being escorted down to the abattoir at the age of six months or having your teats squeezed dry to make our Coco Pops more palatable, presenter Jimmy Doherty probably had a point. But Jimmy didn't stop there, even claiming we have a "special relationship" with our bovine friends. I'm not convinced: We give them a decrepit old shed, an occasional change of hay and an electric fence; they give us a few gallons of milk and a couple of kilos of sirloin in return. It all seems slightly one-sided.
