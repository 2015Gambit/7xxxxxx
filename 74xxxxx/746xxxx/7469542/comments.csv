,pjones452,2012-07-24T23:20Z,"shut the fuck up i've seeding over 300 gb, publichd is almost always the first one to upload an HD movie and this movie is far from 1080p"
,xxDeepThinkerxx,2012-07-25T00:50Z,"10/4...   Well, it does say 720p-1080p - Looks really good on my 42 inch plasma tv (Samsung) : )

Some people, are hard to please:
I have been waiting for this for ever, I have been up-to-date on every video that has come out, and this is the best! Has it's moments, but its better than the others and ii has low megabytes!! So start Seeding 301.85 Gib buddy! Don''t be so hateful..."
,Oblivilot,2012-07-25T06:08Z,"people, People, PEOPLE!! Chill... you two are both just fine - let's save the hatred for those a$$holes who upload 12 fake torrents all at 667MB within 2 minutes of each other, always the same damn films that are still in theatres! I have reported them time and time and time again to P.B. to get the accounts deleted. They pop back up again with a new username a few minutes, days, or hours later - with the same fake torrent crap over and over again. This HOWEVER,  seems just fine! Often those fake torrents  - when you click their username, you can see what they are trying to do. They just make up different sources and change around the name, and I don't even bother downloading their sh!t anymore. I just sent PB a message with the username, and report 'em as fake torrents. This movie comes out on bluray and whatnot in a few weeks, so it will prob be up around these parts in a million variations sooner than later. Until then - let's all heed the words of the Lorax:

âUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, Nothing is going to get better. It's not.â 
--The Lorax"
,Oblivilot,2012-07-25T06:46Z,"To confirm, it's not fake. It's actually resolution, however, is only 1024x576.. I does not look like a cam, and looks ok. Not sure what the actual source is? Maybe a stream capture or something.

Audio is digital / stereo, sounds clear and fine.

Video quality maybe 6 or 7 or so? Depends on what size screen you view on. Some pixels and such, get father back, prob looks just fine.

Again - NOT FAKE. It's real, it's solid.

THANKS!
