This album is dedicated to the memory of Rev. Rex Ubu (Byron Wilkes), a hero and guru to the freaks and weirdos of Florence, who was never afraid of being himself or standing up for the little guy even in the face of absurd authority and labyrinthine bureaucracy. This world and Florence are even sadder for the loss.
