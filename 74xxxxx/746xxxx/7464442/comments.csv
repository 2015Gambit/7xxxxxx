[T],SecTPB,2012-07-22T09:58Z,"For what it is, even though it's such a small filesize, the quality is very good. DSR means ""Digital Stream Rip,"" which means it was taken from a satellite broadcast using either coaxial cable or composite cables. 

Resolution: 640 x 368
Video Codec: XVID MPEG-4 
Framerate: 25FPS
Bitrate: 1,010 kbps


Audio Codec: MPEG 1 Audio, Layer 3 (MP3)
Audio Bitrate: 127 kbps
Channels: 2, Stereo.

For the resolution and bitrate, along with how watchable it is in general, here's my rating...
V: 9/10
A: 4.5/10

Audio is buzzy and condensed a lot, but it's typical for your standard below-SD release. I still think even SD releases should at least have higher audio quality."

Stay classy pirates."
,crabdlx,2012-07-22T19:04Z,this has been one of the slowest torrents for ufc ive ever had considering there are plenty of seeders
,2332481,2012-07-22T19:52Z,I would skip downloading the PPV and download the prelims.
,ripper30,2012-07-22T21:59Z,"Thx Scene4all, what you do here is great.I could not afford this. Thx for putting it out. All my resources goes to raising my son.I just stay away from any news source until sun morning, then i get to watch the fights,just about 6 hours behind most others...I still feel the same excitment , as i dont know any winners....Thanks"
,arathanstorrents,2012-07-22T23:18Z,"loganÂ´s back!!!

,TaiTheGuy,2012-07-23T04:09Z,"A - 8
V - 3 !!!

I cant BELIEVE I'm the only person, so far, to put a -1 on quality. The video quality is AWFUL!
I'm not saying it lightly- at all!
It seriously looks like a CAM or telesync, a fuckin bootleg really.
It's Watchable. On a computer. Not on anything bigger than 22"""
,warheart209,2012-07-23T07:18Z,Save your time and bandwidth this Fight sucked ass i actually paid for it and hands down is worst ppv UFC has ever put out...

,aztralcap,2012-07-24T12:16Z,Much appreciation.  Good quality.
,bobobo1234,2012-09-12T23:47Z,"all post-fight interviews on stage cut out -- a real pity, particularly for both main events."
