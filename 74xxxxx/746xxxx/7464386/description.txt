Two time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank delivers an unforgettable performance as Amelia Earhart, the legendary American aviator who boldly flew into the annals of history.  Richard Gere co-stars as her charismatic business partner and adoring husband, George Putnam.  Bound by ambition and love, their enduring marriage could not be broken by Amelia's determination to fly - nor her passionate affair with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor).  Equal parts gripping drama, stirring romance and epic adventure, Amelia will take your breath away and send your spirit soaring.
