,scyris99,2012-07-24T04:56Z,"Nice always wanted to try gtv-4 on my new pc, I tried it on my old one but it ran like ass. I know there are other versions but was way to many diffrent files needed, this version is nice and compact all in one place. Damn though this is one hell of a big download."
,xpmule,2012-07-24T06:28Z,"hmmm
i wonder if this installs both EFLC and GTA in the same install directory ?
Many people already know that normaly if you install both you have two install folders.. 16gb (x2)

i split my eflc/gta 4 images into 4.7gb
files and burned them and they work fine. they still auto ran and setup worked perfect.

Seems like a good torrent but it would be nice to see more feedback/info.
(i'm assuming this is the newest official release)"
,ileumfour,2012-07-25T12:48Z,"@ Tom_Hawk: uhm, the game and all its dlc/expansions maybe?"
,civoniz,2012-07-26T02:57Z,"I'll be honest, it's shady as hell, so I'm not DL'ing anything until we get some proper feedback :D If it IS real tho that would be nice!"
,Rage18,2012-07-26T16:33Z,"@civoniz Are you usually this dense or do you not know what a VIP is? They don't release things without them working, since most of them are usually scene releases. Spout that crap on an anonymous's release page."

,Vorax.J,2012-07-30T04:24Z,"I need help. When I start it from my desktop icon, it seems to be working at first, it shows a few credits and rights cards, but then it crashes, and says it's unable to create depth render target - Check that your Video Card meets or exceeds the minimum requirement. Any help on how to do this? "

,lolpirate42,2012-08-26T01:25Z,Hey this thing is downloading wayyy to slow 3 to sometimes 20 kb/s sometimes with 50-170 but it doesn't last long
,lolpirate42,2012-08-26T01:26Z,"If you know what could be the problem, PLEASE I NEED SEEDERS AT LEAST AT NIGHT THANKS!!!"
,lolpirate42,2012-08-27T19:20Z,"PLEASE SEED, I'm stock at 28%, still need to download 19GB"
,Synixtrix,2012-09-12T05:00Z,"Cool - thanks heaps for this - I have been looking for a decent release of this for PC for a while, having played it on a mates console - One of the reasons I want this is to use a mod that enables you to look like the robot characters ATLAS and P-body from Portal 2. ;D"
,Synixtrix,2012-09-12T05:02Z,"P.S. I will seed this, I can't have been the only 1 looking for it for so long."
,Cadu10,2012-09-16T21:26Z,"Legit torrent. All I Can Say, playable with the latest updates."
