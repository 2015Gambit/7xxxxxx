There is a newer version of this that (hopefully) corrects this.

The hash has changed, so it is a different torrent. But only the affected file has been replaced. So save the files from this version of the torrent and download over top to save time.

I am trying to get Pirate Bay to delete this version. But this has not happened yet.

Very sorry."

I did this since this torrent was already well ""out there"" before I noticed, and there was no sign that it was going to be removed from TPB's index.

So unfortunately there are now two almost identical torrents for this, with one file slightly different! Take you pick I guess.

Again very sorry. And embarrassed."
