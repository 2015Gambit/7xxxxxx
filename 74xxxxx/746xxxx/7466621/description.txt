TV with TV's Jonathan Torrens

This show aired on TVTropolis in Canada from 2009-2011. It aired off and on for about 24 months, with no clear season breaks (there's nothing online that lists episodes by season). 65 episodes were made, and here they all are!

Jonathan Torrens has been a regular on Canadian TV since 1989 (Street Cents, Jonovision, Trailer Park Boys...). Most recently in 2012, he's appeared in most episodes of the series Mr. D. If you know who Jonathan Torrens is, and if you like his comedic style.. then you will like this show. 

It took ages to finally get all 65 episodes. I started capping this one a while back, just for myself... but decided when I finally had all the episodes, that I would put it 'out there' in case there are other people who liked it as much as I did.

I was hoping the show would continue on into 2012.. but it wasn't meant to be. I'm grateful for the 65 epiosdes that were made.

TVTropolis does not have an HD feed, so these have all been capped from TVrip, via digital signal.


Show Description:
In this multi-channel universe being run by misguided tele-visionaries, only one man has the confidence-instilling inflection to rehash, recap and dissect all the goings-on and goings-wrong of the wide world of television. His name is Stone Phillips, but heΓÇÖs unavailable. Instead, TVΓÇÖs Jonathan Torrens stands and delivers the State of the TV Nation, pruning the bushes and pulling the weeds from all over the television landscape.
