,elin0449,2012-08-17T21:53Z,"Awesome upload! 

Sadly I'm stuck on 99.7% with 33.4 MB left. Episode 5, 6, 12 and 16 ranges from 99.9% to 98.2%, while ALL the subs are 0%... 

I'll seed this atleast 10 times over when it's complete, so please help me with the last 0.3% by SEEDING. 

Always SEED after you download to help others! "
