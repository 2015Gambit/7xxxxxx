A self taught guitarist, Leftwich has pitched himself in the right music camp. With 'Pictures' produced by Ian Grimble (Mumford & Sons), and a support slot for Noah and The Whale, his target audience has always been near by. His talents are clear, and it becomes obvious as you listen that Leftwich doesn't even really have to try at this. Citing influences from the likes of Nina Simone, Sigur Ros, and Kate Bush, you get a real sense of what he is trying to convey.

'Pictures' has elegance about it. Some folk singers fail to achieve this with their choice of tempo. There isn't even a slight hint at that desperate search for a hook you can sometimes get. It's delicate, emotive, and so raw that each individual pluck of the guitar can be distinguished.

With just four tracks, this is yet another snapshot of what Leftwich is capable of. His song writing abilities easily match his performance.
