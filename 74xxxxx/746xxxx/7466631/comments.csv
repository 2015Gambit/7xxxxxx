,Halizar,2012-07-23T05:27Z,So this seems big for an mp4 and a 1 hour show. Real ?
,Halizar,2012-07-23T05:38Z,I thought MP4 files are the new best file type cause they are smaller and just as good as avi files. This 1 hour show is bigger by 100 MB. ?

,wtrsair,2012-07-23T23:09Z,"Yeah, AVI is the best. I can play it on my DVD player through USB port. mp4's won't play and are larger in file size...please bring back AVI's! :)"
