In Sherwood, Ark., where cheerleaders are like royalty, Alisha Dunlap is the queen bee.  TLC's new reality-TV show, "Cheer Perfection," depicts the competitive world of cheerleading, and shows that the cheerleaders' mothers are just as competitive as their daughters and are unapologetic about living vicariously through them.
The show takes viewers behind the scenes of a sport that is not for the faint of heart. And Dunlap, the co-owner and coach of Cheer Time Revolution in Sherwood, is tough.
