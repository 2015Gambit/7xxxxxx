The book doesn't necessarily explain in depth the why's of algebra; however, it does break it down into very small and simple steps with many examples to help your understanding. The textbook is definitely user friendly, which doesn't always happen. The investigations in the units are wonderful hands-on and real-life context problems. Wonderful for learning and implenting in a classroom for students!
