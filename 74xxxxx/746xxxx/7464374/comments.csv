,ez-eBooks,2012-07-22T16:41Z,Thanks for letting me know. I think I may have forgotten to link to the tracker for some reason. As soon as I put it back into Vuze it started uploading.

however, if you don't want to download them that really doesn't effect me in any way :D  I was uploading some individually to learn how to properly upload torrents before I screwed up larger torrents. Now I'll probably be doing most things by author."
