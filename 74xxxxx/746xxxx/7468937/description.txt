2)  Ho Chi Minh Trail 
Sue Perkins and Liza Tarbuck drive the legendary Ho Chi Minh Trail, a network of dangerous roads hacked through mountains and jungles of Laos and Vietnam. Its role in the Vietnam War has left it one of the most perilous roads in the world as it is littered with unexploded bombs. Sue and Liza face a gruelling drive to some of the least explored sections of the trail, with both terrifying and hilarious consequences.
