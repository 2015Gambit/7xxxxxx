
"Cornerstone", the latest album offering from Hillsong LIVE, was recorded in Sydney, Australia and is a reflection of that firm commitment. This album offers fresh, new songs to congregations worldwide, with a simple desire to place emphasis on Jesus and a prayer that people everywhere - regardless of circumstance - will be encouraged to find hope in Christ, the Cornerstone. Filled with songs such as the title track ?Cornerstone?; new anthem ?Beneath The Waters? (I Will Rise); and upbeat praise, ?Running?, our prayer is that this album will be a blessing to the global Body of Christ, filling churches and homes with the worship of an ever-faithful God.
