RELEASE NOTES

When you, as a young boy, are dropped off to visit your uncle, you
notice something s wrong. First, he s not there to greet you. Second
there s the explosion that happened right as you arrived. And third
the house seems to be even weirder than you remembered it

Now, your job is to find and ultimately rescue your uncle, by using his
newest invention, the Interdimensional Shift Device (or IDS), to switch
between dimensions and solve puzzles. That sofa too heavy to move?
There s a dimension for that! Switch to Fluffy Dimension and that sofa
is now light as a feather. Need to get up to a high ledge? There s a
dimension for that! Just switch to Anti-Gravity Dimension and things
begin to float upward. Need to make things heavier? There s a dimension
for th well, you get the idea. Switch dimensions in real time, work
your way through the crazy complex mansion wings and rescue your uncle!
