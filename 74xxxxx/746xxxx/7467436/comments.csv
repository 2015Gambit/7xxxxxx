I cannot allow any kind of censorship. If I don`t like it I just don't watch it. What you did is so wrong . Remember, everybody curses an we are all naked underneath our clothes. An if you are alive it`s because millions of your ancestors (even your parents ) had sex."
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-23T21:20Z,"People are entitled to their own opinions and preferences. If you don't mind the nudity, watch it uncensored, but don't try to control what other people have access to.

If you read the description, you'd see I didn't remove the profanity, just the nudity and sex. I know my parents had sex, but I don't want to watch them have it. If people don't mind, then their entitled to their opinion, but so am I.

Try to be more open minded."
,param436,2012-07-24T10:14Z,hahahahahaha YOU should be openminded flameleg you sorry excuse for a narrow minded fuck. cencosring shit like a 3rd world country.  go fuck urself
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-24T14:17Z,"Let me guess, the person attacking someone with a different view than their own is the open-minded one, eh?

Open-minded = ""Receptive to new and different ideas or the opinions of others.""

Not, attack attack different ideas or the opinions of others."
,mantikor777,2012-07-24T23:55Z,"Thank you Flame_Leg.  This is VERY helpful.  My 12 year-old son loves the books and, until now, has not been able to watch it (because I won't let him).  Now he can enjoy the film.  Well done, sir.  I salute you and the effort you put into this."
,mantikor777,2012-07-24T23:59Z,"@ sertorio and param436:  There are plenty of places where you can find the full, original version.  YOU are the ones who would restrict MY freedom of choice.  Flame_Leg provides freedom to me and those like me.  You freakin' lefties are such hypocrites and don't even recognize it - how narrow minded is that? "
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-25T04:11Z,"Glad you have some use for it, but remember I just removed the sex and nudity, and pretty much all the cussing is still in it. It also has a lot of mature themes, lots of violence, and sexual references.

I suppose if your son read the books, he's already read all of it, so it's probably not a big deal, but maybe you should watch it beforehand to see if you think it is suitable. Everyone has different values they try to instill in their children."
,mantikor777,2012-07-25T08:08Z,"I'll take your advice and watch it first - all the same, thanks."
,sertorio,2012-07-26T21:24Z,"To mantikor777: Do you know me ? So don't you dare to label me. As I told before to cut a work of art it's wrong so I keep my ground. I am happy to know that you have a son that is not allowed to watch the outside of a beautiful human body but can watch the insides without problems. That's what a call a good education: love is wrong, killing is right...
Now I understand Columbine, Denver and all kinds of mass murders that made America famous ."
,jc128,2012-07-30T15:41Z,"This works very well for me. My wife doesn't enjoy watching stuff with me when there's nudity. There's no logic to her discomfort, but it's there. So this ""prime-time"" version is perfect for me. Thanks!

And censoring is not the same as censorship. Censorship is the suppression of communication. By offering a censored version, Flame_Leg allows us the CHOICE of self-censorship. I now have the choice of watching the show uncensored, but alone, or censored with my wife whose feelings I respect. I am free to choose.

Don't want the censored version? You are free to chose another download."
,xunderworldx,2012-08-15T19:53Z,"jc128 I completely agree with you. I have a friend whos wife wouldn't' watch it & didn't even want her husband watching it because of all the sex scenes.

Yes all the sexual tension and so on might add to the story but, if someone doesn't really want to see it, I can't see it hurting the story all that much!

I'm downloading this so I have this version in case someone I know wants to watch it without all the ""action"" as flame_leg pointed out! You did a great thing by doing this, for all those who are looking for this, you did them a great favor!"
,harbo2010,2012-09-16T04:04Z,"thanks for doing this Flame_Leg, my dad wouldnt watch game of thrones until i showed him this censored version.  kudos"
,harbo2010,2012-09-16T06:26Z,"SERTORIO - 
it's obvious your completely irrational... your comments do not deserve a response, but i will play along... I mean this with sincerity... Your beliefs are completely irrelevant to the purpose of this website and your comments are completely retarded.

      Re-tard  -  [ri-tahrd]
         to make slow; 
         delay the development or progress of (an action, process. EX: ThePirateBay); 
         To hinder or impede.

I am thankful i could watch this series with my younger sister and not have to watch Incest... Gay sex... Softporn... You might think there's nothing wrong with that... and your beliefs are your beliefs... But the close-mindedness your showing sounds like a result of your upbringing... as you said:

 ""It was a horrible thing to HAVE*** someone choose what you were allowed to see. I CANNOT ALLOW ANY KIND OF CENSORSHIP"" 

This is why i think your responses reflect retardation: 

You do not know the difference of CENSORED and CENSORSHIP. You should have said: ""I CANNOT ALLOW ANY KIND OF SELF-CENSORSHIP"". Your implying you donât hate fascism as much as you say... hypocrite??? the answer is yes =] 

also...

You cant be ""naked"" under your cloths because the definition of ""naked"" means not having cloths on. So the correct way to say it is something like... ""If we all take our cloths off we would be naked"" But it's ok Sertorio... i understand what you meant to say ;)"
