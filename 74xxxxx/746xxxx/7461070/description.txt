An original CD of original 2Pac's album "7 Day Theory". This version contains an alternate track sequence (resulting in alternate fade-ins and outs, as well as deletions and extensions to certain songs) and is missing four tracks which appeared on the retail version (Toss It Up, Life Of An Outlaw, Just Like Daddy, and Me And My Girlfriend), but features six tracks (Watch Ya Mouth, Friends, Lost Souls, Niggaz Nature, an untitled interlude, and When Thugz Cry) that are exclusive to this version and remain unreleased in their original form (although an alternate mix of Lost Souls was featured on the Gang Related soundtrack and Friends, Niggaz Nature, and When Thugz Cry were released in remixed form on Until The End Of Time). This CD is rumored to have been the CD playing in Suge Knight's car the night Shakur was fatally shot in 
Las Vegas.
