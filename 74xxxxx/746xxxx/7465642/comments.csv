,ninjakecil,2012-07-24T03:26Z,"The order is 450 1st moto, 250 1st moto, 450 2nd moto and the last is 250 2nd moto, right?
I'm kind of afraid to be spoiled by the commentators, just like they did in the Budds Creek. I watched 450 1st moto, 450 2nd moto and they're talking about who's winning 250 1st moto before 450 2nd moto started.

Anyway, thanks a lot, slicknick!"
