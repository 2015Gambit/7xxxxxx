Battlefield 2142 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and produced by Electronic Arts (EA). It is the fourth game in the Battlefield series. BF2142 is set in the 22nd century, during a new ice age which sees two military superpowers ΓÇô the European Union (EU) and Pan Asian Coalition (PAC) ΓÇô battle for survival.
The game was designed primarily for multiplayer gameplay, allowing a maximum of 64 players on a server or a maximum of 16 players in single player mode against bots on Conquest mode. It has its own ranking system to keep track of the user's stats similar to the one used in its predecessor, Battlefield 2. It also opens up new categories of vehicles and weapons not seen in Battlefield 2. Battlefield 2142 has an unlock system allowing the player to choose a new unlock every time they achieve a new rank rather than making them purchase the item. EA Games has also released a booster pack called Northern Strike, which contains new maps, unlocks, and vehicles
