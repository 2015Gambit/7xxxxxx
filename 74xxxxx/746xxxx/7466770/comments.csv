,K-pip,2012-07-23T05:49Z,and... seeding. Thanks guys!
,veloxity,2012-07-23T08:05Z,I'm getting very low DL speed (~25kb/s) but my UL speed is ~500kb/s. Am I doing something wrong? this is taking forever
,ControlTheRoom,2012-07-23T08:06Z,"The only issue I have, and this is for both E01 and E02, is that I cannot get a download speed of more than 50 kB/s, and on average it's 10 kB/s. ONLY with these two torrents. Everything else downloads at 1 or 2 mB/s. WHY!!!???"
,ControlTheRoom,2012-07-23T08:07Z,Any ideas DibyaTPB? Just your two torrents...
,Ferke_,2012-07-23T09:22Z,Seed it yo
,alienhead22,2012-07-23T09:33Z,"With the ratio of seeders to leechers its expected to be slow dl.  The speed available for download is the same speed that is being uploaded, if people just hit and run then the speed will be slow.  Hope this answers your speed questions."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-07-23T09:52Z,Web DL is coming in few minutes. :)
