IMMERSE doesn't play properly in MPC, shows 5 hour 
runtime and plays audio only, likely some sort of 
broken header. What good is it when you can just 
watch it in vlc only. Every tool they use is a non
standard way of encoding tv and they wonder why 
they have so many problems constantly.

ie. IVTC/RARS/PLAYBACK/HEADER ISSUES

Also, Leverage is the same way but we will maintain 
our INTERNAL as such. IMMERSE's Leverage has a nice 
little video glitch at 38:02, pay attention to that 
next time.
