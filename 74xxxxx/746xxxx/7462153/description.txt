Country-soul combo Phantom Limb draw heartily from Americana roots, while adding moody musical undertones from their native Bristol. Since their 2004 formation, theyΓÇÖve deservedly earned praise for their live shows and, in particular, the exhilarating vocals of frontwoman Yolanda Quartey. 
The Pines follows their 2008 self-titled debut album and itΓÇÖs still QuarteyΓÇÖs singing that sets these melodies apart. She adds both grit and tender depth to lines such as ΓÇÿMy knees arenΓÇÖt made for kneeling at your feetΓÇÖ (from the gospel-styled Tumbling Down) and she impressively rips into IΓÇÖll Have Mercy, but the compositions themselves seem rather polite. 
The music is easy on the ears and expertly played but it feels like Phantom Limb are missing a raw edge here.
