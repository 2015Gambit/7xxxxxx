Things the Shark pack does that other packs cannot do:

1. Full color thumbnails including FLV's and 10bit MKV's
 (also allows users to select at what point by percentage to grab the thumbnail)

When dealing with codecs, more does not equal better.
Having the least amount on your system is the best configuration.
This is exactly what these codec releases will do for you.

You will no longer be restricted to using any specific player.
WMP and your Windows Media Center setup will play all your files.

Note: These codecs ARE ONLY for WINDOWS 7                

Enjoyyy!!
