also if you use 64bit you should install the 64bit add on also..

View change log and download current version at official site ..google it ;)
TPB would not let me post url's"

this is the current version. You don't need 64bit addon, they make things shit. This will work fine with x64 as far as I know."
,xpmule,2012-07-24T06:17Z,"i know its current but it won't be for long..

the app is updated about 2 a month on average. (as stated in your description point #4)

And yes people may need the x64 components.
I sure do !
Because the first thing i do is open the x64 settings app is switch to the Windows Media Player 64bit version as default. So when i run it or WMC it uses the 64bit version instead of the 32bit version. this has to be set manualy other wise you can't use x64 wmp.

And they make thing shit ?
really well i don't know what your talking about, i have to assume you just don't know what your doing..
Setting up codecs can be very trick..
if your having problems with x64 components go to the forum and ask for help.
I'm registered there too.
I have my install setup to use FFDShow for ALL content (x64) WMC + WMP And it works flawlessly !"
,nzraj,2012-07-25T01:38Z,"I am talking about Class not registered error. It occurs right after you open x64 components settings.
How did You choose 64-bit Media Player?
Can you provide the steps from beginning of what you did to help me and others? because everytime I choose 64 bit WMP, I get Class not registered error."
