The Ed Show; July 20, 2012. 

Thomas Roberts filled in to cover the shooting at the AMC theater in Aurora, Colorado (the same district where the Columbine shooting took place). I would personally like to express sadness for the 12 killed 59 injured and 71 shot. 
On the show they examined the facts of the shooting and later discuss gun control.
