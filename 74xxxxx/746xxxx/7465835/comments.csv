,bryentheartist,2012-07-22T21:57Z,most of these songs arent even done by the original artists and most a b sides. :(
,rigmar_radio,2012-07-22T23:21Z,"EXCUSE ME!!!  Bryentheartiste....These are the original 1970's or 1980's hits.   The fact that you are perhaps not knowledgeable enough to know that speaks volumes to me.    Often the original composer chooses not to record the song or does not have the big hit with it.   Examples are Tambourine Man by the Byrds, Jealous Guy by Roxy Music and so on.

I make no bones about the fact that these have all been seeded on the net before, or that I have far better quality copies which I can not post for technical reasons.

The fact is that so called 'modern' music takes parts of old songs and then calls them 'new'.   Yeah right.    The correct procedure when leaching from me and getting all my time and effort for nothing is to SAY THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! Grrrrr....   Please go ahead and list the so called original artist... having dug the hole, I would enjoy you making it a little deeper..."

,rigmar_radio,2012-07-22T23:31Z,Sorry I forgot to mention that some items here are AVI or Xvid..  Ooops.   Majority however are MPEG2 or VOB.
,rigmar_radio,2012-07-22T23:36Z,"I only just noticed that the adverse comment made by Bryentheartist was posted BEFORE this torrent had seeds.   He could not of downloaded the whole thing, just cherry picked ONE track and then posted the comment you see at the top.... What a cheek.   Lets hope he comes back and tells me what B side or non original track he was on about... Somehow I doubt he will.   He is too busy cutting and running...  People like him KILL TORRENTS as they do not seed."
,rigmar_radio,2012-07-22T23:39Z,"Oh and of course the Andy Willams track, Can't Take my Eyes Off You - Done here by the Boys Town Gang was a classic Disco version and is included as it was a bigger chart hit than the original which was of course re issued as a result.  Both songs are great and the Andy Williams version will feature later on in this series."
