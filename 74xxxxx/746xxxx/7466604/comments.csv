Are you crazy?
ASAP ripped the SD version.
This one is the 720p version. They are different.

Btw, thanks DibyaTPB! It's perfect, and seeding already!"

from the Proper on Public HD
'IMMERSE doesn't play properly in MPC, shows 5 hour
runtime and plays audio only, likely some sort of
broken header. What good is it when you can just
watch it in vlc only. Every tool they use is a non
standard way of encoding tv and they wonder why
they have so many problems constantly.'

Apparently Leverage is toast too, waiting for proper on that as well from EVOLVE."
,IndigoAK,2012-07-23T20:44Z,Don't use MPC then?  Never had any issues with anything from Immerse using Splash.
