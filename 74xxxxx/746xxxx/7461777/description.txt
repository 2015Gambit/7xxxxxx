Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Friday, July 20, edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the shooting in Colorado and breaks down how it will be used to push through ratification of the United Nations' gun-grabber treaty in the Senate and also manufacture anti-Second Amendment hysteria in the corporate media. 

Alex also welcomes back to the show country and southern rock music legend Charlie Daniels. Earlier this month, Daniels went on record stating that the UN's Arms Trade Treaty will be used to register and ultimately confiscate all privately owned firearms. "If the Senate ratifies this treaty you can say goodbye to private ownership of firearms because an international treaty supersedes sovereignty and America will be bound by its provisions and disarming America will strike a major blow for global government," Charlie wrote on July 18.
