,jerbear2,2012-07-31T03:05Z,can someone let me know if these are just bad uploads because I'm thinking of putting more torrents out but seeing this is starting to make me back off.  I'm brand new to uploading because I felt I should give back somehow to TPB so if there's anything I can do please let me know!
,j0nnyboy,2012-08-26T10:39Z,"jerbear - i dont want this torrent but I am interested in the Flash by Geoff Johns one you got. I wouldnt even know how to get started uploading stuff on here.

just so you know, your efforts are appreciated!"
