,reowner,2012-07-24T05:55Z,"yea i'm english, not hindi"
,virtualmatrix258,2012-07-24T06:00Z,Fuck your hindi dubbed bullshit.
,marshal_law,2012-07-24T07:21Z,"cheers bro

wow wow wow calm down now its just a movie, 

well i don't understand Indian and next time you upload a Hindi film make sure you ain't got English written down as language but then again it does say Hindi in your tittle and that's enough to know its not English so thanks but no thanks,

no hard feelings    "
,dash34,2012-07-24T09:44Z,"u mother fucker hidden cam, i'll find u and blow ur ass off. Get it in english and on a good still print, even if its on a good cam ..."
,rcr29budcar,2012-07-24T10:01Z,"Ur right, it is just a movie. But considering that most people want an english version, and the hindi version is already up, theres no reason at all to put the exact same one up again!  Useless!"
,stenchtrench,2012-07-24T10:07Z,"Fuck yindoo shit, post in language that people give a fuck about IE English or go run the 7/11"
,aquanovix,2012-07-24T10:09Z,"horrible quality, and audio is filthy raghead language"
,rezabrando,2012-07-24T12:43Z,"Why the fuck did you upload the same torrent, you piece of shit? Go fuck you mom, you imbecile."
,ben.pc,2012-07-24T12:45Z,WTF WE NEED AN ENGLISH ONE YOU DICK 
,buzzkillingtonz,2012-07-24T13:02Z,Jesus you expect Dvd rip quality in a week jesus. IT SAYS HINDI IN THE DESCRIPTION! Plus this guy copied off the other guy. Give it a week and their will be some good cams. If the shooting didn't tighten down security at the theaters too much.
,rcr29budcar,2012-07-24T14:21Z,"I want an english version as bad as anyone does, and this was a stupid, useless upload, but people seem to be overreacting just a little bit."
,peterhoover,2012-07-24T15:26Z,"My bet is that there will not be an English version for a long time, what with the shooting in Aurora.... there will be tightened security at the theatres and nobody will risk bringing a cam."
,akthi,2012-07-24T17:26Z,"here is the ENGLISH version fellas!

,tflagger997,2012-07-28T18:02Z,Exact copies of material already on TPB should be deleted.  Like this one.  It just clutters the place up and wastes our DL bandwidth/cap and time.
