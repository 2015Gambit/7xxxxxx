This game takes place in the Irataton Expanse.   This is a region of the galaxy that is only reachable by a wormhole which is only open during the month of January every year.    Recently, the Galactic Federation has announced that the Irataton Expanse is open for business.    You are the representative of a corporation and with your seed money and command ship you are rushing into the Expanse to colonize and exploit the area for the benefit of your corporation.   The Galactic Federation has stated that ideally you will help stabilize the region and establish a thriving interplanetary community.   *Mad laughter!* - You might even accomplish this if you are not busy trying to sabotage the actions of the other corporations.
