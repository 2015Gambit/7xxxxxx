I think kickstarter.com is potentially a way to make copyright and DRM a moot point.   The goal is not to get uber wealthy from my work but, to simply be able to survive and feed my family while doing that which I love.   To that end I am putting this to the test.

I released the mac and windows Alphas as advertisement to hopefully get people to try it out and then go back the project at kickstarter.

If I get the backing then we'll be adding multiplayer for certain and potentially a lot more.

Things such as better balance, better AI, and more features.


Since, this is my product I give you permission to copy this Alpha 10 version of the game anywhere you like.   It is our advertisment.   Spread it around if you want to help us out.   If you cannot afford to fund us on kickstarter and would still like to help out then just spread the word."
