Live at Reading is a live CD/DVD by the American grunge band Nirvana released on November 2, 2009, chronicling its 1992 performance at the Reading Festival. Bootlegged for years following the performance, the new issues present the performance for the first time mastered and color corrected. The performance of the band's 1992 hit single "Lithium" was previously released on the home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!! in 1994. The performance of "Tourette's" was previously released on the live compilation From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah in 1996. Live at Reading marks the first time on a Nirvana release that Chet Powers receives songwriting credit for the use of his lyrics from the song "Get Together" as the intro for "Territorial Pissings". It features Cobain wheeled out on stage by music journalist Everett True.
