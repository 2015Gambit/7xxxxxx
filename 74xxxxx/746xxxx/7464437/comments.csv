,oldFalconGT,2012-07-22T09:27Z,i agree its too big
,noelcm,2012-07-22T09:44Z,"Bidawi - help. First upload ever, forgot to click ""start seeding"" in utorrent. Any chance to fix this or delete the file and start again?"
,bidawi,2012-07-22T16:10Z,"Try ""right-click"" on the file name in uTorrent and Tracker""."
,bidawi,2012-07-22T16:11Z,Click on Force Start or Start.
,bidawi,2012-07-22T16:13Z,"Or get Help at uT site.
Good luck, otherwise, just start over by splitting this in at least two uploads.
Cheers."
,bidawi,2012-07-22T16:32Z,"*That should have said click on ""Update Tracker"""
,noelcm,2012-07-23T07:45Z,"I've made a mess of this and will redo it as
""Extended Woodstock Directors Cut"".
I'll keep seeding for at least the next 6 months."
