[V],psspss,2012-07-22T01:52Z,"chasing ufos Ep5 is out also

I had to go a bed so didnt get a source and conert
as I normally do."
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-22T06:04Z,"^^^The link you posted has 0 seeders, this one has hundreds.

,xpmule,2012-07-22T08:03Z,"yeah 05 is also released by AFG and MSD here on TPB aswell.. (use search button)

i watched this torrent and i've never watched show like this before andit wasn't too bad. the story about the CIA giving permission to a guy.. was an interesting story and the guy on the show (that rammbled on for 20 minutes straight lol) made some excellent points."
[V],psspss,2012-07-22T09:39Z,"it has seeders when I checked.. afg wasnt out with xvid at the time..

perhaps I should of just upped my version
after all"
[V],psspss,2012-07-22T09:41Z,"since tpb adds these udp trackers and if your using proxy and disabling udp and utp that can leak real ip..
I find if you change the UDP tracker called ccc.de:80
to http and add /announce on the end you should find a few seeders"
[V],psspss,2012-07-22T09:43Z,"but yeah this one looks like a few seeders now
and better quality as bigger in size

[V],psspss,2012-07-22T09:56Z,"if you enjoyed these then you like all the other ufo
collections uploaded

the one on the bell was interesting here
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7448990/UFO_Mixed_Videos_Jul2012_xvid_avi

although see the link for the OOS fixed versions
and video blur fixes in the comments there"
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-24T00:54Z,"It was a joke of an episode anyway. Looks like they needed some filler so they told Ryder to go off-roading in a 2WD rental truck so they can get it stuck on purpose. May as well have Snookie, Pauly.D and the Situation ""Chasing UFOs""."
[V],psspss,2012-07-24T10:21Z,"i think your find they have a bit of fun.. ryder flirting and showing of with the guys as usual

but I think they didnt expect all that to be in the episode and more of the interviews and investigations

just history edits it in a way to be entertaining and make fun of UFOs instead of making it a serious program"
[V],psspss,2012-07-28T02:10Z,"if you want to find heaps more seeders
add this tracker as well.. it may go from 4 seeders
to 20 or 50 seeders like
http://tracker.ccc.de:80/announce"
