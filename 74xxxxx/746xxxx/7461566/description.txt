MrRom92 here, with another reel to reel transfer. 

This one here is a very nice sounding 4 track classical reel, 7.5 ips, Ampex duped, dating from 1968. I mainly collect 2 track classical, but Carmen is a fave of mine, so I picked this one up. It since has become my favorite recording of the piece.

There exists a 24/96 torrent of the same recording from LP, made by someone else. I invite you to make your own comparisons, and enjoy.

As usual, original automation tones are left intact, and all hi-rez scans are included, including the original booklet which came with the tape. Tape is transferred to 32/192 wav using a professional quality studio deck. The highest of hi-rez audio.

This piece is a classic which should be preserved and introduced to generations to come. Please ensure this happens by seeding, as well as looking out for my other tape transfer torrents. Look forward to seeing 2 track, staggered/offset early stereo tapes, 15 ips masters, and many other rare reels presented in hi-rez.

Thank you, and enjoy.
