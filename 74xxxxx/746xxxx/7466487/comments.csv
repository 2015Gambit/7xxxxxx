,ProtestTheHero86,2012-07-30T01:26Z,"@JabZta You are most certainly welcome :) I saw that this album wasn't anywhere up on here so I thought I would take the liberty to go ahead and make it happen. Be sure to check out my other torrents, I have more coming once I get the motivation to start uploading. There's still about 20 CDs I have yet to upload. "
