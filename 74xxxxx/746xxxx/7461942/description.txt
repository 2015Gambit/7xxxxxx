There is a dispute between DirecTv and Viacom which has resulted in Spike Tv and 25 other channels from not being broadcasted on DirecTv and that is why I couldn't capture and upload TNA Impact HDTV 2012-07-19 last night.  I'm sorry for the problem but sometimes as the old saying goes "shit happens". I ended up having to download the TNA Impact HDTV 2012-07-19 show off the usenet earlier today just so I could see last night's TNA Impact HDTV show. DirecTv and Viacom came to an agreement today so next week I will be uploading TNA Impact in 720p HD.  

This is SDH release #775  for the wrestling fans from a wrestling fan. First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 6,000 kbps from the 1920 x 1080i HD source on 07/20/2012 on the SyFy HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite then converted to 16:9 widescreen 1280 x 720p resolution Framerate is 59.940 with an average Video Bitrate of 5000 kbps in a High Quality 2.74 GB 720p H264 AVCHD Blu-Ray MKV release with 48khz 384 kbps AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 channel audio show runtime 1 Hour 26 minutes 27 seconds

This is my 40th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show WWE wrestling fans. 


To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic Home Cinema player or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesnt play the video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay players that are MKV compatible and have a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and my LG BP-620 3D Bluray player does.
 

Enjoy the WWE Friday Night Smackdown HDTV show wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my WWE Friday Night Smackdown HDTV 2012-07-20 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH mkv release.

I will be uploading the historic 1,000th episode of WWE Monday Night Raw this coming Monday Night after the show is over on ThePirateBay,se and KickAss Torrents.
