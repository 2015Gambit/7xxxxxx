This is the first of 4 episodes from 1961 originally filmed in color. 
The end credits give that away, and new drawings in the opening of 
John McIntire and Robert Horton. Unfortunately, the original color prints 
are nowhere to be found!! These black & white copies are apparently all 
that was found in the NBC / Universal vaults, and were the versions s
hown the first time NBC repeated them later in this 5th Season. 
The show went to color regularly by the time the series moved to ABC in 1963.

Guest Stars -- Polly Bergen, Morgan Woodward, Kathleen Freeman, Joycelyn Brando.
