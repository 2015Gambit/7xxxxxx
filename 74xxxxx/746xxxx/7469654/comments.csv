,Niksey94,2012-07-24T08:33Z,"""P.s: There is no crack, just unlocked files. All you need is wait for the crack to play.""
Read at least some parts of the description please."
,hisazul,2012-07-24T08:33Z,that is one bizzare question... did you even READ... description?... clearly said this was basically unpacked/decrypted version of steam pre-load... so pretty much still useless

,Mercer99,2012-07-25T19:28Z,"Prototype 1 was cracked release day, as with most other steam games. I have no clue why this is any different."
,premiado,2012-07-25T20:36Z,The new 'CEG' steam encryption is harder to crack.
,Mercer99,2012-07-25T23:59Z,"Oh, I guess we should just wait for RELOADED to crack it then. "
