The Private Life of...
Jimmy Doherty investigates the hidden lives of the farmyard animals which are so often taken for granted


3)  Pigs 
There are five and a half million pigs in Britain and we spend, as a nation, ┬ú9 billion a year on pork products. But surely, wonders farmer Jimmy Doherty, there must be more to pigs than their taste. Jimmy visits a farm in Dartmoor to find out about pigs. How sensitive is a pig's nose? Why can they find truffles underground? How do piglets find the right teat to feed from? Pigs are very intelligent, but can they recognise themselves in a mirror? Not only do some pigs have straight tails and stripy fur coats, Jimmy Doherty proves their intelligence in a series of challenges before introducing you to the wild boar, "the SAS of the pig world". Worth watching purely to see Jimmy learn how to converse in pig, this is probably the only time you will ever see a pig and its "corkscrew todger" work its way towards "what must be the world's longest ejaculation".
