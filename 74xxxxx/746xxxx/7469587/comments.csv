,wenex,2012-07-25T17:20Z,"So is this some new dirtbag trend, where people either really drop spoilers or pretend some lame spoiler? There are a lot of fuckheads on this site, but these guys are a special class."
,SrMLove,2012-07-31T08:39Z,"@wenex: this is something i have stressed with great importance as well..... movies and tv shows, ppl have started doing this shit.... this is not the forum for your stupid opinion.... it is for useful, helpful, and/or informative information about the torrent, file, and/or something of that nature.... not information about an episode/movie that someone is looking at the comment forum for info.. and they get to see your dumb ass message ruining part(s) of the show/movie...... to put it into words all of you fuck heads of a ""special breed""(as ""wenex"" puts nicely).... You guys/gals suck... most likely at every aspect of your life. TPB wants as many good vibes as possible.... so stop ruining... well everything. which seems to be what you have accomplished. all of you... and you all know who you are. so stop fucking doing it. no one cares what you think and no one wants to hear what you have to say.... so just don't even bother... its a WASTE of time. for you and everyone who has no choice and is forced to come in some form of contact with you. what ever it may be.....all of this really = EVERYONE HATES YOU!"
,SrMLove,2012-07-31T08:44Z,"nice work VTV... much appreciated... excellent quality as always. keep up the good work.

(see dumb fucks that is an example of a proper comment)... you douches probably don't even seed like you should... there is a known courtesy on torrent sites. and you need to learn your shit.... quick"
