,bidawi,2012-07-24T02:36Z,Now you have to leave your torrent app open until your upload is well seeded. This means until several of the leechers have finished and they in turn leave it open so more can downloaded and so on. Thanks.

,bidawi,2012-07-24T10:04Z,"You must leave your Torrent app open until you have uploaded all of it. That is why I mentioned to you that the upload is too big. Take the biggest file, Woodstock Directors Cut HD.mkv and make that one torrent. Then you can upload the rest of the files in a second torrent file. It will be more manageable and leechers will have the opportunity to pick only the files they want from the second download. I use a Mac so your app may be different then mine. The overall principle though is similar. Good luck. "
