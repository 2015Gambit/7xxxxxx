Daemon Tools is an application which creates virtual CD drives on your hard disk and emulates the physical protection systems of some CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs.

Daemon Tools creates a virtual drive which allows it to be used as if it were just another DVD or CD drive, except that, on this drive, you can mount CD or DVD images (CUE, ISO, CCD, BWT, MDS and CDI).
