Thanks"
,aurora1623,2012-07-27T14:53Z,"you need to seriously get your cam angles correct before posting movies sure enough its good audio and visual but for the first 2 mins of the movie its all over the place there is no audio, it freezes and then we see the tops of the chairs in front. If you are going to go to the movies and cam it get your shit right and without faults"

aurora, are you complaining about free shit? i mean we dont see you in the download list so you mean youre telling uploaders how to do their job but youre not doing it yourself? you came here to download, so try doing that without letting all that sewage drip from your jaws okay? thanks! :)"
,bigmike1280,2012-08-04T20:53Z,"i've noticed that the uploaders take a lot of shit, but what some people don't realize is that most of the time, it is not them who recorded the movie. they get hold of it and try to make it more watchable. it's not their fault if it's a shitty copy to begin with. i'm just sayin. cut em some slack, the shit's free. if you wanna bitch, go buy it with your punk ass."
,maxmaxpayne,2012-08-05T15:20Z,thanks for the helpfull information Aurora.

,missgothika,2012-08-07T21:18Z,"Wow... more than 2 or 3 months and still not a full copy (not cam). I don't know why is it that complicated to get. And if anyone says ""go to the movies"", i live in argentina and this movie isn't /wasn't showing here. anywhere.. so, that."
