[V],mdprosser,2012-07-27T21:20Z,"Episode 9 of Design Star will be the last episode... I'll post it as soon as it's available here (hopefully today or tomorrow)... but, there will be a special 4 episode Design Star All-Stars beginning July 31, so I'll hopefully be posting that too...  and Project Runway should hopefully be up today, since it aired here last night... I promise I'll post them both as soon as possible!  Greetings to Africa!  :)  "

Aaaw bless you for hookin us up with Design Star 7 finale (9) and Project Runway s10 and to enlighten us on the fact that there may be an All Star Design Star :) Yay! Looking fwd to it all. Thank you so much for your noble efforts mdprosser, especially in propagating the creative genre tv shows. Much Love. :) I wish to be a competitor on one (or both) show/s one day, lol, wishful thinking :P 
Did you watch the Olympics Opening ceremony? The symbolism of unity in the torch lighting ceremony was stunning :) Wishing you an amazing weekend ahead.
