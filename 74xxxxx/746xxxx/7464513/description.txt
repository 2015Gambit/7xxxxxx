
This scene release from 2010 has vanished from the internet.
Almost all links have been removed from various hosting sites.

I hope to bring these files back to life :)

Please Note:
Anyone considering downloading this release must understand,
that my connection speed is slow (50-60KBytes/sec up)
I wouldn't bother uploading this (because of my slow upload)
but it's a shame to see this rare dvd rip of a good show vanish.
It would be a large understatement to say it was hard to get ;)

Release Notes:
This release originally came with subs and nfo's and any source
i could find for these have long dried up.. although some of
the many subtitle web sites still may have the subs and i was
able to find pictures of the nfo's (included in torrent)

Lastly this the DVD version and when searching I found a user
over at Demonoid who rip'd the dvd and the extras but i decided
that i wanted to track down the Nodlabs scene release instead.
After reading the release notes it may have been a good choice
considering the dvd contained multi fps's (see nfo ivtc notes)

This show is one of those hybrid ones, small parts are
30fps but mostly 24fps. We decided to ivtc as most of it
requires it so expect some jerkiness on the few 30fps
scenes.
