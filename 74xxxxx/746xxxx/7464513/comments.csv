also i don't expect people to seed forever etc
but if each new downloader seeded a bit we should be to keep this release floatin around the net..

don't forget new people this dvd was
released in 4/3 format (it's not 16:9)
I don't think any 16/9 was recorded for the show in the 1st season so.."

If you search around on google you will see all the links are old and dead etc.

I see way too many of these scene releases dry up and vanish :(
Often there is a random person that rips a dvd but i have faith in scene release groups.. they have done their homework and have the expertise. There is so much to know about audio and video !
Althouth in the last year i have deleted scene dvd rips and grabbed a p2p source instead.
For example:
Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1 - Season 1 DVDRip aAF 
Looks like shit !
Sounds great lol but uhhhmm so what..
if the picture is butchered then who cares what it sounds like.

6 channel audio shouldn't be used unless the release is a 720p release i think.
Squeezing the 6 channel audio stream into the scene rule file size cap is the problem. For example if the audio is normaly 30% then the space available for video is gonna be 70% obviously.
So if you bump up the audi stream size to say 50% then what ? Obviously the video quality goes down 20%
And sadly this is EXACTLY what has been happening in the last year or two .
Crappy trend !
To see with your own eyes what i mean
check out this,
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6924396/Aqua_Unit_Patrol_Squad_1_-_Season_1_DVDRip_aAF
I uploaded this even though i've since deleted it (its garbage quality)

anyway i just mentioned that because i want to raise awareness about that some what new trend, many people probably wouldn't notice or try other releases etc"
,xpmule,2012-08-18T21:05Z,"who ever gave me the negative vote, thanks asshole lol

This is NODLABS release and if you look around you will notice this looks better than the tv rips etc
AND
It wasn't broadcast in HD so what does anyone expect  ?

I normaly don't care about feedback but i am surprised someone gave me a neg vote :(
Although i have done it by accident myself.

I'm gonna go and have a good cry about it now !!!

Thanks again to those that have helped share :)"
