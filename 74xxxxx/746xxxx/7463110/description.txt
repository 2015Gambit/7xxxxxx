Quote:
Four immortal brothers and sisters are entrusted with ivory cards in the dawn of prehistory by a dying shaman, and told never to use the cards together. Four immortal brothers and sisters, four archons, leaping through time, consumed in an epic struggle to influence and shape the history of Western civilization. From MosesΓÇÖ challenge to the Pharaoh to the origin of the Grail myth; from the PopeΓÇÖs extermination of the Cathars to NostradamusΓÇÖ travels in Italy; from the Spanish Armada and the Great Fire of London to NapoleonΓÇÖs conquest of Egypt; and finally to the Angel of Mons appearing over the trenches of World War I: a secret occult history of the world.
