,bleslie1,2012-07-23T15:36Z,"Yay! You managed to get the full episode! :)

Lol, surprise for me! I had already given up hope last Saturday and was just looking forward to Monday's show so I could catch up. VERY happy you got it though.

I can't imagine what it took to find it... I looked EVERYWHERE and you are literally the only person I can find who offers full shows of the soaps like this. 

Your hard work is very much appreciated by all of us. Thank you so so much! :)"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-07-24T11:54Z,Thanks so much...! I had to look for a while but then I got a tip that CBS aired the show in the middle of the night again so I was able to get the re-run...!!
