,kcc02,2012-07-27T00:09Z,This is an mkv file - no good for ps3
,Archon12,2012-08-01T11:53Z,"@ kcc02 - it's true that the PS3 can't play files with the Matroska container natively, but that's an easy fix...I use the MKV2VOB program and it takes about 5 minutes to convert to an AVI with no loss in quality and no appreciable gain in file size. 
I don't even watch BB on Sundays anymore, I just wait for eztv to upload a commercial-free, uber-high-quality version on TPB  :D"
