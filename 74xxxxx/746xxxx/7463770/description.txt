Dragons Den (UK) Season 9

Budding entrepreneurs, inventors and small businessmen (and women) pitch their ideas to the five "dragons" - real-life business leaders and millionaires, with real cash to invest in the companies they feel will make it. Each 'contestant' must convince the 'dragons' to part with thousands of pounds to make their dreams a reality.
