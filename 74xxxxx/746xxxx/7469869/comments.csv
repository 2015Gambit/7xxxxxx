Thnx for the good work."
,Slangerb,2012-08-19T00:46Z,"With all the negative votes and comments, I should be cautious but I've never had a problem with your uploads.  "
,BioHamoo,2012-08-20T08:11Z,"good quality, no issues with audio syncing here"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-08-29T07:00Z,"For anyone having doubts about quality of this because of lame-ass people's attempts to sabotage, remember, there was a time (not long ago) that if you wanted to be sure that what you were getting was top-notch, you'd hope to find a Zen_Bud UP.
And you either didn't know who YIFY was, or just KNEW that his stuff was inferior to Bud's in every way, except in size (by a small margin).

There's a reason this uploader has a green skull. And a reason why if you search TPB for ""Batman Begins"" and organize by ""SE"", this is the 4th result out of over 200.
Not to mention that there are hundreds of thousands of movie-goers all over the planet who find many other uploaders torrents useless, which don't contain subtitles for the language that they speak."
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-09-05T23:43Z,"@ TaiTheGuy THX bro :) 
I will keep them coming."
