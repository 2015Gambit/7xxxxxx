Joboshare Movie DVD Copy is an easy-to-use program that lets you copy movies from DVDs and burn them to other discs. The program's basic features and simple interface make copying movies a snap.

The program's interface is plain and intuitive, and it more or less walks you through each step of the process. Insert the source DVD and select whether you want the entire contents or just the main movie, and chose D5, D9, or a custom format. The program then quickly copies the selected files to your computer. Once that's done, the program takes users through the process of burning the movie to the new disc. The whole process is quite simple, and even people who aren't particularly computer savvy should have little trouble getting the hang of it. The program produces high-quality copies that leave both the video and audio intact. The program's built-in Help file is quite brief, and we would have liked a bit more information about video formats and the like, but overall the program needs little in the way of explanation. We found Joboshare Movie DVD Copy to be a great choice for people who need a quick and easy way to make copies of DVDs.

Joboshare Movie DVD Copy is free to try, but the trial version puts a watermark on its output. The program installs and uninstalls without issues. We recommend this program to all users.
