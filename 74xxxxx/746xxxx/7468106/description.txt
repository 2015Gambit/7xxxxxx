After "crashing" the super hero convention in Reno, the nigh invulnerable blue-clad super hero, the Tick, is deemed the protector of "The City." On his first patrol he runs (more like "falls" into Arthur, an accountant in a moth costume. They soon strike up a partnership. When the villainous and muffled idea men threaten to flood The City, the Tick and Arthur come to the rescue. Along the way we meet Die Fledermaus, American Maid, and the Caped Chameleon. The Human Bullet cameos.
