If you couldn't find these by yourself, I won't either. We all use the same tool (Google) and the results won't vary. As I think of it, you have this extra tool I don't have: Determination. Don't give up (and have a Plan B... like scanning them yourself?).

@CrowZero
Type ""calculus"" in the search box at the top of this page and find close to 150 entries to choose from. TPB has the largest selection of calculus texts in the torrent world. Your only (moral) duty is to seed back at least as many MB as you take."
,CrowZero,2012-07-24T07:51Z,Okay! Thanks.
