The Big Knights was an animated television programme on BBC1. It consisted of 13 ten-minute episodes, and first appeared over the Christmas Season of 1999-2000.

The stories tell the adventures of the two Big Knights, Sir Boris and Sir Morris, who are incredibly strong and brave, but are also incredibly stupid. They solve crises, usually of their own creation, but cause great destruction and mayhem in the process.
