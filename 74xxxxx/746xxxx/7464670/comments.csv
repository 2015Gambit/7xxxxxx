,hammer2085,2012-07-27T11:46Z,"Nice one! Just wanted to know does this has ""superfetch"" service? If not anyway to re-install it?"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-27T17:46Z,"@hammer2085

Also if manual install is not there, how would i install software like dropbox for example 

thank

,RinTosaka,2012-08-14T05:07Z,"Could you upload the version with Japanese and Chinese?

I work with some obscure Japanese programs for ripping CGs from visual novels, and without Japanese language support I haven't a clue what any of the options mean (I can decently read Japanese and the programs have no English translation)"
,RinTosaka,2012-08-14T06:00Z,"Wait, scratch that.  I'm not even able to get XP Mode working on the 32-bit version of this.  So unless you can make it work or until I can figure out how to get it to work or some other workaround, you should hold off for now on uploading the x64 lite full with all languages."
,nileshtambe,2012-08-15T15:23Z,"@RinTosaka
hi , take ur time rin, let me know what u need in os 
i will make special os for u , as u wish , just let me know what u want in os in detail .."
,RinTosaka,2012-08-16T08:01Z,"It's nothing special, I just really want XP Mode to work and support Japanese characters - heck, I don't even need IE or WMP or anything.  So basically all I'd need is your Win7 64 bit lite v9, but with Japanese and XP Mode support."
,RinTosaka,2012-08-16T08:03Z,"Whoops, completely forgot - I'd need the same thing but in 32bit for another PC as well."
