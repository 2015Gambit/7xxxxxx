Bob Marley:This Land Is Your Land
While there is little argument that Bob Marley was the finest reggae performer and songwriter of his time, it is sometimes forgotten what an effective protest singer and dynamic spokesman for the underdog this pioneering poet also was. And although his message was always one of peace and he never recommended fighting fire with fire, he managed to affect the political situation for better in both his homeland and around the world by preaching the simple dictum, love thy neighbour. This film documents both the music and the message of Bob Marley as it investigates his life and career in a manner not previously undertaken. Featuring contributions from many who knew him personally, rare archive interviews, seldom seen footage and photos and an array of other features which altogether reveal the kind of man Marley was and the effect he had by making his music the message.
