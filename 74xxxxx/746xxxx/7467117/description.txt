      I'm surprised no-one has posted one of Latin America's greatest classics - that refers to the novel, but any movie with Maria Felix is also a classic. 
  Doña Bárbara is consumed by bitterness because of the cruel way she was treated when a young traveller. Now she has become rich and acquired a big ranch which she runs with an iron hand. Eventually this leads to dire consequences...

There is a bit too much narration, but the acting is excellent.  If you like ranch sagas, you'll enjoy this one.

In segmented mpg format - it plays fine, you might have difficulty burning it.
