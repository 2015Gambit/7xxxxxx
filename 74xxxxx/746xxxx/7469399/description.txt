Burn it to a disc.  If you don't aleady have a program capable of burning a .iso file to a disc, I recommend power iso.  It has a free trial that never really ends and it is easy to use.

There are 2 files in the torrent.  1 is a 64-bit version and the other is a 32-bit version.

Each disc can be used to install:

Windows 7 Starter
Windows 7 Home Basic
Windows 7 Home Premium
Windows 7 Professional
Windows 7 Ultimate

The installation includes updates through SP1.

After it installs windows, it auto installs windows loader.  You will never be asked for a registration key during the whole process.  You will be completely registered and activated.  You will have an OEM license and the key will change every time you restart your computer.

The disc will automatically detect your hardware and match your background to the appropriate manufacturer.

You can also use this disc to upgrade from Vista. 

I didn't write the Loader program or bootstrap it to the installation.
