,tcw347,2012-07-31T23:46Z,"Hello DPJaymo. Thank you so much for this torrent. I had to extract after burning which you did not mention. Otherwise it works great! I do have a question though, about updates. Can I or should I allow updates or does it do it automatically when a restart happens, etc? I am really not sure how that works. I am a novice computer user so I need a little extra help."

,Captcha_Z,2012-08-14T21:29Z,Do i need to delete all of my files?
,DPJaymo,2012-08-15T01:26Z,"You don't have to extract anything after burning this iso.  You can boot to it for a fresh install or you can run it from inside vista to upgrade.  As for updates, this will be completely genuine and you can install ALL updates.

@Captcha: what would you need to delete?  No you do not need to delete anything."
