,catpuke,2012-07-20T18:49Z,click on 'files' at top left you idiot. it's all yifi stuff.
,sarcastos,2012-07-20T21:55Z,"wanderlustus was asking for a description, not just file names. so looks like the idiot is the one who doesn't know that words have meaning. Your name is very fitting, that is what your brains are made of."
,wanderlustus,2012-07-21T00:13Z,"Thanks, sarcastos.  Exactly my sentiments.  Catpuke = apropos."
,catpuke,2012-07-21T14:34Z,"Haha oh crikey, i've upset a pseudo intellectual! Look, it's not that hard really to make the jump from the file names to searching for the original file, this took me a few seconds http://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/torrent/6681865/28_Days_Later_(2002)_720p_BrRip_x264_-_750mb_-_YIFY 
Sorry about the pirateparty.org thing but i'm in the UK and this place is BANNED! by the bastard courts. 
And don't call me an apropos, i hate it when people do that..."
,wanderlustus,2012-07-23T19:23Z,Fair enough.  How about I just call you . . . douchebag?  That work for ya?
