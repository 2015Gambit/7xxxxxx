Sarabande is the second solo album by Jon Lord recorded near Düsseldorf (Germany). The orchestra was conducted by Eberhard Schoener.

Sarabande is considered one of Lord's best solo works.

Lord was quoted: "the compostitions were good, the musicians were outstanding and the conductor understood the music. Everything came together and I have to say, nothing I made before or since comes close to Sarabande."

The complete Sarabande suite was premiered in live performance in Budapest on 18 September 2010 and later in Sofia on (30 October) and Essen (15 November). Lord amended the 1975 orchestrations, and also orchestrated Aria, which was played on piano and synthesizers on the recording, and Caprice which was simply a group performance on record. 'Finale' was made-over to allow the ‘parade of themes’ section -which was done with tape-loops on the recording- to be played live.
