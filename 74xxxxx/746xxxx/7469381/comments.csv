Oddly enough, saw this on SlickDeals for $10 after rebates and I ordered a copy! So, now I don't need this at all but it did work for me!"
,BaconMushroomMelt,2012-07-31T02:07Z,I have the original SiMON torrent for this. Which iso do you need to just get the updates and DLC? Or do you have to download everything again?

,anujvir,2012-08-01T22:28Z,"Ok...It's confirmed Guys...This is working...

I played just a part of it.

Here is what needs to be done:
1. Install the game
2. Start the game...If there is an error saying xlive.dll is missing, download xlive.dll from http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?xlive and place the .dll file in the install folder in 2 places
a. D:InstallsBatman Arkham City (main directory)
b. D:InstallsBatman Arkham CityBinariesWin32 (inside the Binaries - Win 32)
and you are good to go

3. If when you start the game again and it says there is another dll file missing called msidcrl40.dll, download it from 
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msidcrl40
and repeat step 2.

I suffered some frame rate issues, although not while gameplay(strangely) but on the start screen...and voice lag while one of the cut scenes. Hope that's temporary. "
,anujvir,2012-08-01T22:29Z,Yes this is a GOTY edition...or so it says while installation on the setup window.

,indexftw,2012-08-05T11:41Z,Works fine. Don't forget to install Live ID assistant and GFWL itself.
,Erthling,2012-08-06T00:45Z,"Problem here
To make a long story short, I uninstalled the older version which didnt have Harley Quinn's revenge due to some errors and installed this complete GOTY edition.

The game runs fine, but I cant save and I realised that Windows Live isnt launching at all, let alone give me the option to sign in with my old profile.

I tried redownloading the xlive.dll files into the 2 directories, but nothing seems to work.

Im thinking of uninstalling Microsoft Games for Windows Live and reinstalling it.

Oh, also I installed the Windows Live assistant, but nothing happens when i launch the game, and even pressing the Help button to bring it up does nothing.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated..."

,Viteztame,2012-08-12T04:06Z,"I was have the same issue as Erthling and abhi1423.(i was put xlive.dll manually) then
I install  Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE (nothing happens), then i delete xlive.dll from Batman Arkham City (main directory), and BinariesWin32 (inside the Binaries - Win 32) and it work fine"
,abhi1423,2012-08-12T23:33Z,"ok i got it 

@Erthling,Viteztame
1. i installed the ""games for windows live"" (just google it and go to site and download the software). 
2. open/run/execute ""Windows Live ID"" program from your windows program menu. and keep it open as it is . no need to login
3. start your batman AC game. and when windows live prompts you to login just ignore/cancel it.


and thanx a lot .BONE."
,abhi1423,2012-08-12T23:37Z,"@.BONE.

next time when you try to rip off the softwares from the game , just keep the ""Games for Windows live"" software intact. it doesnt occupy much space

and thanx again 4 the upload"

,Erthling,2012-08-17T12:05Z,"abhi1423, My problem is with getting Games for Windows Live to begin with.
Im trying to download it from any website, and all im getting is Games for Windows Market downloaded.
Im not sure what it is, but its certainly a different application than the 1 I had before which I cant seem to get running to sign in offline to be able to save!!!
Can any1 help with this and the .dll files issues?
I simply get nothing from any Games for Windows Games Live or Market popping up when i launch the game (which works fine... just no saving)"

,Wyldefyre,2012-08-24T03:32Z,"Question, everything works fine great torrent btw, but is there any way to fix the no saving? It says that if I don't sign in with a Windows Live ID then I can't save, and when I do it says I need a product Key, you know the XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX thing? So how would I go about doing this?"
,supernova_95,2012-08-26T15:49Z,"I have tried everything .BONE. (windows live free account logged in,only running gfwl in background,xlive pasted,xlive not installed or pasted)It won't create offline account outside the game 
it doesn't let me save no matter what 
Can anyone propose a solution to this or can the uploader just up the files to integrate gflw with the game separately to put an end to this disaster  
@Wyldefyre 
How did you get that far mate
in other titles you can create an offline profile which lets you play if you get gflw in game,you should try that if you are in game :D
Please help me its hard downloading 16 gb you know :("
,varso2012,2012-09-04T00:58Z,"i tried everithing to get work but nothing.......so i find this and then ¡¡¡FINALLY IT WORK FLAWLESS!!!!......""I've lost an entire day searching the forums and the Internet. Finally, what helped was removing .Net framework 4.0 from computer with tool called 'net framework cleaner' (cleanup_tool.exe 287kb), and then re-installing of 'directx redist june 2010' and 'xna 3.1'. When I later installed 'dotnetfx4.0', game continued to work"""
,Darth_Adversor,2012-09-06T23:51Z,"Regarding Games for Windows Live problems, here's what worked for me.  I had been running an older version that I installed when I played Arkham Asylum.  It wouldn't launch without an update, so I updated it to the most recent version.

1.  Launch GFWL.  Do not sign in.
2.  Launch Arkham City.
3.  During the intro credits, GFWL should appear with a login prompt.  After a couple seconds, a box up in the upper right corner should say ""Player 1 signed in.""
4.  Hit Escape or click the back button to collapse the GFWL interface.
5.  If all goes according to plan, the game will explain the auto-save feature and you'll be able to select a save slot.  Voila!

This is basically the same process that abhi1423 described.

On a side note, I don't believe this is the GotY edition.  The readme shows 1.0, and DirectX 11 performance is suspiciously bad, which makes me think it also does not include the DirectX 11 patch that came out a while back.  This seems like the base game with some DLC thrown in.

Anyway, great game and thanks for the upload .BONE.!"
,cagle06,2012-09-08T22:08Z,Does anyone actually have a way of causing the game to save? I have done as many others have spent an entire day trying to bypass the live login that wants a registration key. Help out jwatkeys@aol.com
,danielmz,2012-09-09T22:19Z,seed plz i love batman i need to play this game :D seed and i will seed for ever 
,Darth_Adversor,2012-09-10T01:37Z,"@cagle06 and anyone else having problems with GFWL:

I could be completely wrong, but I have a theory that having created and used an ""offline profile"" on a previous installation of GFWL might affect whether my earlier instructions will work or not. 

It's a convoluted solution that may not work, but here's what I would try:

Download RELOADED's release of Arkham Asylum. It's on TPB. Install it.

Completely remove anything relating to GFWL from your computer. IIRC, there were multiple entries under Add/Remove programs. Reboot. 

Explore the Arkham Asylum iso and find the Windows Live folder. It's an older version and when the game is launched, will give you an option to play with an offline profile. For me it assigned ""Player 1.""

As a sidenote, if you haven't played Asylum, play it. It's awesome. Anyway, at this point, go ahead and exit back to your desktop. Try launching GFWL...it should prompt you for an update. It should give you a direct link to download the .exe. Go ahead and update and reboot. 

Now launch GFWL but don't sign in or anything. Just leave the window open, and then launch Arkham City. 

After a few seconds, it should recognize you as Player 1, and once it does, you can hit Escape or click the Back arrow to collapse the Windows Live interface. 

If it works, the game will prompt you to select a save slot before you begin playing. "
,Darth_Adversor,2012-09-10T19:20Z,"One last thing, I was wrong in my earlier post about this not being the GotY edition.  Add/Remove programs does indeed report it as GotY, and also version 1.03.  

Sorry about that."
,AKERSEKOMIS,2012-09-10T23:57Z,"Works just fine, thanks to the uploader!
For those experiencing problems its probably because GFWL isnt installed correctly.
Make sure you install marketplace, live redistributable and live id assistant. "
,DrSalvador555,2012-09-11T20:02Z,"Err...I've been getting an ""Access Denied"" error when I click Install. I'm Sure it's just my being stupid. If someone can help I'd be very grateful, Hell, if someone answers fast enough I may donate via PayPal."
