,Joohnnyboy87,2012-07-25T02:42Z,Is this for PCX2 or is this for PC?
,Kheregen,2012-07-28T18:10Z,"""mgs2.exe stopped working"" or something similar...I should have expected that. Other versions gave me black screen. I already tried every crack, patch, fix that i found, but none worked yet. Creative Alchemy also didnt work.

specs: Win7 32bit
1gb RAM
AMD Athlon 64 Processor 3200+ 2.01 GHz
ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series

somewhere i found i has to do with the graphic card, but im not sure.."
,Jazz1992,2012-08-10T15:41Z,Can someone please seed this? Most of the time the download speed is under 100 kB/s...
,fslaker,2012-08-15T00:27Z,It's working but sometimes my computer shutdowns...and I don't know If it's the MGS2 or it's my computer fault since it used to do that but had stopped and now happened again with the release.
,fslaker,2012-08-15T21:21Z,"well..it looks like it's my computer anyway since I downloaded another version and it keeps shutting down..
Weird is that no other game keeps doing that..which makes me think it isn't the CPU temperature.."
