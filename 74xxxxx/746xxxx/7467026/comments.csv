Your other upload of this has been deleted."

But this looks invaluable for us System Shock fans. Thank you so much :)"

But the actual iso one has the same problems as everything else, hitting panel does nothing, hitting install does nothing.

Ah wait, testing before I hit submit, run as admin opened it up.


Running as administrator is probably required for installation."
