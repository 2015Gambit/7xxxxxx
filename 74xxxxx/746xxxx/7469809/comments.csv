What Racism are you talking about. I agree it is bad . towards ANY other Race, but o one has posted in Racist remarks???

Samuel Jackson, (The Black-Afro-American actor, writer, producer) was park of this project Arsenio Hall (another Afro- American is one of the STARS of this movie. Samuel jackson doesn't act in this movie but put his own money into the project.
Why would Afro American actors, and other Afro Americans involved bother to help this movie get maid if they thought the content of the movie had racist implications. The Plot/Screen play was also made with other back actors and If you have seen this film it has an almost ALL black cast. Why can't Black people make money in Holly Wood and in satire/comedy that is funny because it plays up on many assumptions and actually is Pro Black actors. It seems like you have the race issue. Richard Pryer made jokes all the time about black people and dropped in Nii__er word through out his stand comedy during much of his career. IF, There was ANY Racism in the plot, screenplay, I don't see how any of the BLACK folks involved it's t being made would even, I don't think these actors would have involvement with this 11 minute animated Late night Tv series. It is based off a movie of the same name and, has the same people backing it as well 

Can you elaborate on what your saying and where is there Racism???

I'll check back to see if now you realize that you have sadly missed the point. . . . IT IS A FICTIONAL COMEDY

Hopefully this con help you see how you are speaking as if you never even watched this show,?  there isn't any jewish person that sinks money in a movie about jewish people and is all about making for themselves look foolish, Why would anyone do this even be able to happen. PLEASE, let me know what your talking about

no evidence of racism is in this animated TV series/ nor in the movie with actors, (the Movie is not animated)
