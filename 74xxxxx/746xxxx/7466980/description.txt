Two years on from the gently experimental Silent June, the "chamber folk" duo Belinda O'Hooley and Heidi Tidow return with a set that shows even greater bravery and far more confident vocal work. The album is again dominated by O'Hooley's inventive piano playing, first heard when she was with the Unthanks, but here she also adds accordion, while the occasional backing is provided mostly by strings. To this the duo add their finest harmony singing to date, particularly on the unaccompanied tracks: the Irish ballad She Lived Beside the Anner and an exquisite reworking of Massive Attack's Teardrop. The Fragile is an appropriate title, not because of the music, but because of the lyrics. Many are concerned with ecology, old age and death, and at times they verge towards the sentimental. Then there's a self-written, charming lament for a much-loved cat, a bleak view of humanity as seen by a bird, and ΓÇô best of all ΓÇô the upbeat, true story of a 17th-century female landowner who seduced local women, to the fury of their husbands. An intriguing, ambitious set.
