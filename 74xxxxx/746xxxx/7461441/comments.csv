,bullerbase12,2012-07-21T00:24Z,FAKE PUSSY TORRENT  LIKE ALL
,dean2804,2012-07-21T00:58Z,"bullerbase, it's from TvTeam and while them and SceneBalance might not be my favourite uploaders for being to lazy about putting some Goddamn info on their torrents, I can say in all confidence this torrent is not fake.
I am puzzled as to why they're uploading an R5 from 2002 though."
