"Made in Europe" takes place in a single night in three different metropolises of Europe -- Madrid, Paris and Berlin. The film can be watched as three short films or one feature with three parts. There are not any predominant plots or stories, but rather a group of characters (mostly men) in each city, talking as they do with one another. The film focuses on the sad existences of these men, rather than on their stories, conveying this through sharp, realistic and surprisingly shocking dialogue.
