Seven years after the announcement that the 2012 Olympic Games were to be held in London, the moment has finally arrived. One billion people are expected to be watching worldwide as an 80,000 capacity crowd fills the purpose-built stadium in the East End for the official start of the 30th Olympiad. This live programme follows the run-up to the ceremony, with BBC reporters capturing the atmosphere in the Olympic Park as crowds and dignitaries arrive to take their seats, and around the rest of the UK as people eagerly anticipate 16 days of sporting competition.
