,drymoused,2012-07-28T09:31Z,"""This live programme follows the run-up to the ceremony...""

This is NOT the Opening Ceremony then, it is the program that preceded it on the BBC. VERY misleading title."
,moshster,2012-07-28T11:51Z,"@ drymoused

It IS the opening ceremony.  Stop confusing people."
,UAofE,2012-07-28T13:00Z,"At 4 hours long, this IS the opening."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-07-28T13:01Z,Drymoused: Get a life.
,rax369,2012-07-28T15:30Z,"Alright thanks for clarifying that.

For a moment a thought what drymoused was saying was true."
,snipeyou,2012-07-28T22:52Z,Dibya: Could you up a 1080p version of this?  I know someone who was in the opening ceremonies and want the highest res version possible to see if I can spot them :]
,UAofE,2012-07-28T23:28Z,"Wow, snipe is a loser."
,hayamax,2012-07-29T00:18Z,It is the BBC stream? 
,snipeyou,2012-07-29T01:07Z,UAofE: wtf is your problem?

,SuperJimSmally,2012-07-29T07:22Z,"With a handle like UAofE, how can he not be a dumbass!"
,xAsheliax,2012-07-29T10:19Z,Is this the BBC version?
,rigmar_radio,2012-07-29T16:21Z,Yes this is the BBC 2 Sports Channel version and unlike Eurosport (who used a MICROPHONE to connect viewers to the stadium sound!) has very good audio.   It is quite a show with reference to the UK's past and future and the stage effects and music are nothing short of World Class.   Way to GO BBC!  Thank you seeder :-)
,brilo747,2012-07-29T18:17Z,"Is the commentary here same as BBC One commentary, which is the commentary in the SD version?

,cazz4,2012-07-30T15:12Z,"The torrent name should be fixed.

It can't be easily find in search and that's why the download rate been sucking."
,humpahoe,2012-07-30T17:13Z,You fucking idiots. Does this copy have the fucking commentary or not?
,xAsheliax,2012-07-31T08:45Z,Like rigmar_radio said the commentary and video is from BBC 2 Sports.
