 Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting,
 filtering and encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI,
 DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs.
 Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting.
 
 * This script i created is for trying to mimic the x264 TV release standards.

Its based on encoder settings taken from video headers.
Settings are very similar across all tv shows and groups, so what i did
was copied the most common settings into a profile / script for Avidemux.
Since the official scene rules are a guidline there can be varying settings.
See the scene rules document for tv release more info (720p is seperate)

The script is set at the following (edit script if needed)
Or use the Avidemux Menu Options to change settings.

Video Codec = x264 (Custom Profile)
Video Dimensions = 720x404 (16:9) *default
Audio Bitrate = 128 CBR 48Khz (STEREO)
Container = MP4

To use this you need to have Avidemux installed (x86 or x64)
Copy script to the following directory,

C:UsersAdministrationAppDataRoamingavidemuxcustom
or
C:Program FilesAvidemux 2.5scripts
Note the path may be different depending on where you installed Avidemux etc.

Advice & Notes:
- Generaly i try NOT to use smart copy unless the video has problems.
  The smart copy warning / option will come up automaticly for x264 videos.
- I would advise staying away from the 2.6 beta versions, they are buggy..
  the code for mp4/mkv have been re-written and are not as reliable as 2.5.6
- If you have never used MediaInfo ? your missing out on a great video tool !
  get it here, select "without installer" if you don't want OpenCandy ;)

Scripting:
If you want to create new encoder codec settings and add them to the script
the easiest way is to open a video, set the options you want and then save
a project or batch job to file and then copy the "codecPlugin" data to script.

To set .mkv as the video container use,
app.setContainer("MATROSKA");

To set the audio codec AAC in the script to 384kbps use,
app.audio.codec("Faac", 384, 4, "80 01 00 00 ");

Lots of examples and some impressive scripts can be found on the net.
