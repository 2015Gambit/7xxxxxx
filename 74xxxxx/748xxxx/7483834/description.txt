Ultra Keyboard is an advanced touch-screen keyboard, with many features geared towards giving you a better Android keyboard experience.

TOOL BAR
Ultra's tool bar provides a ton of features in a tight space. Flick the tool bar left or right to scroll through the available buttons. Quickly change many settings, navigate through text, cut and paste, change dictionaries, change themes, insert emoticons, and more. Show or hide the tool bar by pressing your device's menu button.

CUSTOM THEMES
Ultra supports many keyboard themes available from the market, both free and paid. Quickly switch between themes using the tool bar. You can also use Ultra's built-in theme editor to create your own themes, or edit existing ones. Don't like a theme's font? Change it!

SUGGESTIONS
Like most keyboards, Ultra suggests words while you type. The suggestions box is designed to be smart, fast, and easy to use, with many unique features. Add custom words to your personal dictionary. Long-press a word, and you can black-list it so it doesn't show up in the suggestions.
