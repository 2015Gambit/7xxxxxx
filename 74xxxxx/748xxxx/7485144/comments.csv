@r0ssxx - According to this site

http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Tall-Man-Blu-ray/46779/

This Blu-Ray DVD has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The current movie industry standard is 2.39:1 (rounded to 2.4:1).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29

If that is the case, this movie IS a true 720p. As dcquence stated, the black bars count as part of the resolution. The viewing area may be smaller than some other movies but 450*2.4=1080.

Aspect ratios and the relationship between them and screen resolution is not my strong suit but I am sure someone who has a stronger grasp of it will politely add to this. Bottomline, the quality is excellent and the download speed was fast. Thank you uploader."
