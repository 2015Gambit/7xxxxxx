,GeorgeWest,2012-07-29T16:29Z,"No, its not tin foil hat stuff. There is strong communist mentoring in Obama's past. Many gullible people that were fooled into voting for him must remain in denial of their own complicity in an act of treason. That's where the tin foil hat stuff comes from. Gullible idiots in the voting booth that can't accept what they did. "
,Basuto9,2012-07-29T20:25Z,"Well, George, I guess I'm one of the gullible ones fooled into voting for him and remaining in denial of my own complicity in an act of treason, and you know what? I'm going to commit treason again and vote for this Muslim/communist/born in Kenya president (I'll bet you're a big Orly Taitz fan) once more.
I also spent three years in the Army in the 60s fighting for my country - how about you? "
,sidartha_6,2012-07-29T22:23Z,It sounds good that he has a communist mentor that may create a piece balance. In the rest of the world even Obama looks like an extreme kapitalist like all other presidents from your land.
,elroy23,2012-07-29T23:19Z,"Face it, George.  You're a loser.  You believe this crap because you're stuck in a dead-end job and you're looking for someone to blame, so you pick stupid ideology instead of really looking to see where the problem is.  Get a real job, a real education and stop watching that Australian twit spew stupidity on Fox.  "
,skinflute,2012-07-30T09:02Z,"holy shit, at least learn to spell ""Siddhartha"" and ""peace"" before you start criticizing the americans... you're making the rest of us look like retards. and please do vote for him again, you're helping the rest of us catch up. "
