,vjule,2012-08-29T21:57Z,it says that archive is damaged and it wont open. fully downloaded but whats the prob?
,Verite_Ame,2012-09-05T09:00Z,"""archive is damaged""
that means that the file get corrupted during the download, i did a googling about the cause but the only answer i found is due to ""bad peers"". Now i know why my vuze before had a blacklist option."
