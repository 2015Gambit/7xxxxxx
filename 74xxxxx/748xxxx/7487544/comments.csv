,chaletamale,2012-08-06T08:07Z,this is completely fake. says it needs a password to unzip but file doesnt even open up in winrar with proper password box
,chaletamale,2012-08-07T12:53Z,hmm file seems to be switched back to the regular file. works fine now lol
,Zoraster,2012-08-23T02:37Z,"This file is legit, as it plays fine in VLC.  all those idiots that say it doesn't play or whatever are MPAA trolls. Ignore them. I'm seeding."
