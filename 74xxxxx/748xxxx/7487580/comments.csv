,no-rain,2012-08-01T09:47Z,callumshell1 why don't you just buy the album instead of waning?

,ffuentes_1,2012-08-16T23:12Z,"Thanks bro. It looks like it is a CD rip. I had to manually add every name and artist to each track but track info above is correct.

Also I just wanted to say that I would've bought the album, it's worth it but it's not available here yet. "
