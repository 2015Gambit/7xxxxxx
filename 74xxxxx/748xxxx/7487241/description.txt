This is a custom edited version of the opening ceremonies I have made to try and eliminate as much of the narration from the musical segments as possible. It combines the video from BBC Sports, and the audio from BBC HD, BBC Descriptive Audio Service, and the official soundtrack to the ceremonies.

This includes the entire opening ceremonies with the exception of the entrance of the athletes.
