Stop stealing torrents and wasting our time..."
,l187l,2012-07-28T08:17Z,"teamextreme, this is the prerelease which is the full version released early by mojang so modders can have their mods ready for the official release. Everything is functional and works perfectly. I just got this off radiums site, idk where the owner got it from, just uploaded it because ppl were having trouble with the download. And idk who anjo even is... By the way dont get snapshots confused with the prerelease, they're not the same, this is the FULL game."
,l187l,2012-07-28T08:27Z,"teamextreme I know why you think TE cracked this lol... This was based off the TE 1.2.5 cracked client, but updated to work with 1.3. so I guess SOME credit does go to Anjo... but it was cracked for 1.3 by Radium"
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-07-28T14:21Z,"@187

No Radium  id not crack it at all, you're so full of sh*t.

This was cracked by Anjo, then TE took Anjo's launcher and converted it into a .Jar file so memory could be allocated correctly. All you did was simple replace a few files with the *Pre-release* and put your name all over TeamExtremes Torrent.

This is not an upgrade its a downgrade... No one plays a *pre-release* server and they sertanly don't want Radium name all over the place...

But you know what the funny part is about stealing my torrent? You have not even managed to remove my ReadMe file that is a direct link to my site."
,l187l,2012-07-28T15:38Z,"You're pretty stupid... as the description says, I had no part of this... I just uploaded it because people were having problems, phast left the TE readme because it was their 1.2.5 client, who the fuck cares. And TE stole the gui from some1 else w/o giving ANY credit. I know for a fact that the 1.2.5 wasn't even yours though or else you wouldn't be making a big deal about it when phast even left the fucking readme to link ppl to the TE site. Some1 used the guy from TE's(not you) 1.2.5 client and made it work for 1.3, you're just made TE wasnt first. Phast was the first person to crack it, and this is proof http://radium-mc.com/official-radium-mc-threads/409-team-radium-has-cracked-minecraft-1-3-a.html. Let me see TE's 1.3 cracked client plz. Get a life and stop starting shit online for attention. You arguing online is the only way for any1 to notice you in your life. Do something nice and people might actually LIKE you AND notice you."
,R0YB0Y,2012-07-28T19:07Z,YOU GUYS TAKE THIS SHIT TO SERIOUS ITS FUCKING MINECRAFT!!! Thanks NEWAY TO THE UPLOADER
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-07-29T03:55Z,"@l187l Are you retarded?

You don't need to crack the pre-release. 1.3 is not even out till the first of August...

All you do to use a pre-release for cracked and lregit clients is download the pre-release Minecraft.jar file, FOR FREE from Minecrafts forums and simply replace the existing one, hell they even give you step by step instructions on how to do it... a 5 year old could do this. if your friend thinks he is the first person to ""use"" a cracked client with a pre-release file, well then is a tool.

The reason why the tool left the ReadMe.url file is because I coded a simple back door into Minecraft.jar to prevent idiots like your friend from removing it."
,l187l,2012-07-29T07:22Z,"LOL... skiddy trying to pretend he knows something. In case you havent noticed this is Minecraft 1.3, the one in TE's cracked client(not yours poser) is 1.2.5 so if you did put a ""backdoor"" into it, it's not in this .jar. And he's not my friend, I just stumbled onto his server and found the download, people were having problems downloading it so I uploaded it. This isnt typical prerelease this is the official release, just released early for modders and shit to get their mods and shit ready for the official release so 10,000,0000 people arent left playing vanilla minecraft for a week. Aug 1st update will be the same as this prerelease, you wont have to do anything, and the newest version of bukkit allows you to play bukkit servers with 1.3 even if the server is 1.2.5, so theres no reason to not download it now."
