,rufussondheim,2012-07-28T06:28Z,"not sure what is up,  I am not a tech geek so I am not sure what I did wrong.  Will try to upload it again in the next couple of days, it's late and I need to get up early.  Sorry."
,rufussondheim,2012-07-28T06:46Z,it's currently queued and I do not know how to force it to seed.  I changed my maximum number of seeded torrents so maybe that will help (and I deleted some older stuff that doesn't really need seeding) - Hopefully that will help
,rufussondheim,2012-07-30T15:35Z,"I took this torrent down and put it in a new file called ""new books""  it should be findable if you search for ""mobi"""
