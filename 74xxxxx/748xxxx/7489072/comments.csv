Try here you may have to go into your torrent program and just download the single book if you don't want the whole release.
 This fellow sends up 0-day and other excellent releases and he has excellent material, if you click on his name and go backwards you might find all the recent books you need.  I hope the stuff I send helps supplement you guys along with his material. 
He's been at it longer so I defer seniority to him, and anyway his stuff speaks volumes. Be sure to drop a greet to him, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
  Hope it helps
