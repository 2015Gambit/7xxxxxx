Steel Harbinger is a top-down, 3-D game with a full range of movement. The player takes control of Miranda Bowen, aka The Harbinger, and must rout an alien menace before it heralds in the apocalypse.

 The twist to this tired plot: The Harbinger (while killing aliens and rescuing humans), must eat her victims, humanoid and alien alike, to regain energy. The result? A grisly, action-packed joyride. Steel Harbinger is an over-the-shoulder shooter with disappearing walls. 

The level designs tend to be repetitive, but are challenging nonetheless.
The graphics are very impressive. The Harbinger looks just dandy in her biomechanical bikini, and some of the giant monsters look great (especially the earthworms that turn humans into aliens). Other monsters, however, aren't up to 32-bit par. The only real problem with Steel Harbinger is the save game feature: Players can only save the game after they've found their way to Canada, and then it doesn't seem possible to get back. It's a frustrating flaw, especially since the level following Canada is incredibly difficult. It's also possible get to a battle ground too early. While this wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, players who find Canada before they encounter the logically preceding level won't be able to go back to beat it. The controls are easy to pick up and very sharp, which means Steel Harbinger is both a great game to look at and a great game to play.
