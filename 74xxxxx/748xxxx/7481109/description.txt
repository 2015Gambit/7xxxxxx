All these files are taken from the "One In The Jungle" Archive...a program that aired on BBC Radio 1 from 1995-1998, showcasing the best in jungle and drum&bass at that time. I was amazed to find such a resource online for all this good music. Turns out, however, that the site will be closing down in 2013:

"This web page and all links will shut down permanently on 20 May 2013. Many thanks to all contributors and emails over the years. I simply can't afford to keep this place running. Any gaps will remain gaps forever, I tried my best to fill them."

Seeders welcome for these classic mix sets that could be lost if we don't share them!
