ONLY SEMI-COMPATIBLE WITH JELLY BEAN. THIS IS BEING WORKED ON.
This application was designed primarily to boost the volume of a wired headset. Whilst it will boost the main loudspeaker volume, it may not be as prominant. Please bare this in mind.

Millions of people blame bad headphones for low-quality music, well put the blame where it belongs; your phone and the audio software. Volume+ can fix the issue system wide. Using Volume+ your phone will get a boost in bass, treble, and if you're using our presets, you can finally experience the quality of music that you truly deserve. Being system wide, Volume+ works with Google Music, Pandora, Slacker, and every other music software on your device (that doesn't have a built in EQ). Volume+ might not get you the same experience that you get with those over priced headphones, but what we can promise you is that for $2, you will get music that is finally worth listening to.


What's in this version : (Updated : Jul 28, 2012)

    Bass Boost fixed so that it doesn't block the Volume Controls any more.
    Volume Slider for the Custom EQ fixed.
    Bass Boost values tweaked to work better (effect can be very slight on some devices, even on maximum).
    Graphical bugs fixed
