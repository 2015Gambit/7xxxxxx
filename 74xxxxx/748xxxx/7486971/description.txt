The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday, July 29 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the international and domestic gun-grabber agenda in the wake of the United Nations failure for now to reach a consensus on the Small Arms Treaty on Friday. Alex talks about how the global elite and the anti-gun fanatics in Congress and the White House are now playing possum and plan to reintroduce the treaty and impose it and a raft of other anti-gun legislation on law-abiding Americans who exercise their Second Amendment right.
