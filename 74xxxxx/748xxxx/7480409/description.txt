The MotoGP franchise has established itself as the definitive motorcycle racing game. Moto GP 3 has taken the thrill of the first two titles and doubled it, taking the franchise beyond the realms of Grand Prix racing through the introduction of high-adrenaline street racing in Extreme Mode.

Players can hone their skills on the streets, experiencing the carnival-like atmosphere that follows the Grand Prix Championship around the world. Extreme Mode will feature 16 new tracks, 16 new bikes, a currency system and full bike customization.
