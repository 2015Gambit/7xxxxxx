Your other upload of this has been deleted."

[V],dynstab2,2012-07-30T22:22Z,"Usually it takes a few minutes before a recent upload shows in the listing so be patient before reloading (and triggering the ire of torrent moderators). That said, had velvetfog seen you duplicated another file with your upload (The exact same file? Possible...Look at the sizes) he might have deleted them both!

Don't get me wrong, I ain't defending {BBS} here, who has duplicated dozens of files him/herself, often doing it with bloated duplicates and with his/her bogus excuses of then. I am defending good torrentiquette that says you don't duplicate an existing file in the index unless there's a clear advantage for users. Take the following example where I duplicated BBS' McMurry Organic 8th with a clean, stable file resulting in a 3:1 decrease in filesize and 4:1 decrease in transferred data:

Your duplicate of BBS' Chem 6th isn't good torrentiquette... Duplication is the cancer of low volume torrents like this one, so always search the index for possible duplication before uploading.

Original uploaders are no longer allowed to delete their own torrents as you experienced. They must register to the forums  https://forum.suprbay.org/ , go to the Site Issues forum and in the appropriate subthread ask for the ""torrent be deleted"" (delete the description in the listing). The ball is in your court. [Your upload hasn't been re-indexed on other sites (anonymous uploads rarely are), that is, hasn't spread in the torrent world.]"
