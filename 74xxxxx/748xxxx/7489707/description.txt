One day a girl shinigami (literally - mower of people), ie God of death, n is named Kuchiki Rukia comes on to him, chasing an evil spirit - hollow. During the battle with him to protect Ichigo, Rukia exposes himself to risk ... In the confusion that is at hand, its power is transferred to Ichigo, and he became the God of Death. Meanwhile, Rukia is transferred to temporary human body. Together they began to chase fallen hollow, that swallowed people.  

The game is in Japanese but with English elements, so you do not have a problem with the gameplay.
