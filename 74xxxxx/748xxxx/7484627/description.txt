For those who have "new gear" such as a PS3, X360, iPod/iPhone/iPad, Kindle Fire, assorted tablets and smart phones, HDTV Media Players such as Micca MPlay or IncrediSonic Ultra Play. The HDTV Media Player devices plug into your TV and play almost any format out there, fit in the palm, and cost as much as that old gear did 10 years ago; approximately $50 - more or less depending model. This is for the majority of people that aren't stuck in 1992. Albeit that was a pretty good era for music, technology has come a long way since then. Time to get with the program. It makes more sense to download something that could be up to half the file size of an XviD version and look as good as or better. x264 is used to create quality videos at smaller file sizes to save bandwidth. Some have a monthly transfer limit by their service providers these days and are wasting excessive amounts of bandwidth by going with the dying XviD version. Just sayin'.
