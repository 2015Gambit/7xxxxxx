As usual you delivered what the scene groups missed out on and considering you have said your not that big a fan of p2p i want to say thank you for the effort.

I never 2nd guess grabbing a video you encoded.. its crystal clear you know what your doing.. always great results !"

Absolutely true about the more advanced codecs - that's why they're used for Blu-ray! So many people still don't understand or appreciate compression, sadly, they think it's all about the size, d/l cams bigger than Blu-ray rips...;(

Cheers!"
