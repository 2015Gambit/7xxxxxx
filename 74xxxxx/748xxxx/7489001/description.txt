This is a already extracted version of wow, all you have to do is download and open the game. Its to play on a private server, www.communitywarcraft.com its free. Register there and login using your new client. Its that easy!!
Thanks!
Again our server is 100% free to play on.


Notice:
On our server the alliance and horde are one, you can talk, group, dungeon and even be in the same guild as each other. This adds more people to communicate with. When you sign up post on the forums to introduce yourself and you will get a lvl 80 automatically. Have fun and look forward to seeing you.

We do raids weekly on the server as a server to give everyone a good chance to gain gear. See ya there!
