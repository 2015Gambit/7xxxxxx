,communitywarcraft,2012-08-03T13:43Z,"well, there is a forum on our website where you can find help if needed, and a tutorial on everything. But to start with i would assume you used your email to log-in. Do not do that... USE ONLY your username you created on the site, as if you use your email it will prompt you to download a update. If you do download the update your file will be corrupt and you must re-download."
