POtHS Comment: Another Good one.

Description:


Louis Giglio - Unthinkable 2005:
"Unthinkable You"
"Unthinkable Invitation"
"Unthinkable Rescue"
"Unthinkable Journey"

Review:
"I cannot explain it any better than this. This unthinkable invitation to the greatest story."

Louie Giglio really understands how to break down Christianity to the core. This was the first of 6 or 7 of his podcasts that I listened to on my way down. The Passion Messages podcast can be seen and subscribed to (for any number of music applications) here.

If you really enjoy it (like I do) and want to use it for a lesson, etc, check out the DVD at the 268Store

This world is messed up in magnitude. But there is a more amazing God who has invited us to know him, linking arms with us that we might be amplifiers for the beauty of Jesus to all peoples.

He is not only a global God ΓÇö he's a galatic God. He is bigger than anything we can imagine. We don't have a clue, really, about who we are dealing with. The universe was one of God's thoughts.

Consider the scene of Isaiah 6: Isaiah saw the LORD. God was high and lifted up, not low and watered down. Isaiah realized at some point in that scene that worship will happen with or without him. And it wrecked him. Isaiah felt the weight. He was finished. Are we carrying this? Do we feel this, too?
