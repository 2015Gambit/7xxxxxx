Notes ....: The movie is based on the famous board game "Clue".

Just like the game, the movie has various different endings.

For the initial release we used the main ending on the disc,
AKA "The Trilogy Ending". The disc offers 3 additional alternative
endings and we thought it would be nice to make them available as well.

Naturally it would be stupid to pre the movie 4 times each resoltion,
so we instead encoded the 3 extra endings on their own.
One can watch the full release and the different endings after
the endings are from 1h19m0s), or use mkv merge to create
full versions of the movie, each with a different ending.

We didn't size the endings to a specific target size, but rather used the
same bitrate that was used for the full release to keep it consistent.
