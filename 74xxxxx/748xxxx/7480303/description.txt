Threat by Fragment, registered full version of the MS-DOS game. A great miniature Alien Breed clone. Several episodes of alien extermination in a line-of-sight setting (watch out of they'll get you!) and multiple weaponry.

This is the original indie version before it went through a publisher that didn't do anything good to it.

You'll need RAR to extract and DOSBOX or a real DOS environment to run. I won't helpdesk for anyone.

The game is nowadays somewhat hard to get hold of, so here you go. It's been anonymized and tested to work by our Collective. Enjoy. :)
