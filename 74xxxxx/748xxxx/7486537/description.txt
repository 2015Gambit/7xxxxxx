                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary exploring the phenomenon of EL James's erotic novel, which is the UK's  
 fastest-selling paperback of all time. The programme examines the sociological and 
 cultural effects that Fifty Shades of Grey is having on the nation, with visits to a 
 spanking class for novices and an S&M couple who have had contracts for sex drawn up 
 for each other. Psychologist Pamela Stephenson, Belle de Jour author Brooke Magnanti 
 and members of a North Yorkshire book club offer their views on the novel.
