,jdoshier,2012-07-30T20:18Z,Cutting edge special effects (straight from the 1950's).

,pjhercules,2012-07-31T17:22Z,"Haven't seen this one yet but Thanks.  I loved the original with Eddie from ""Eddie and the Cruisers""!!!"
,b15h0p74,2012-07-31T20:50Z,This movie is one of the reason's I started to love sifi. Ty 4 the up. As for special effect's they were cutting edge when we old geezer's first watch it. Now we have warm feelings around hearth when we remember that we witnesed to the birth of the sifi as we know it today. 
,b15h0p74,2012-07-31T20:52Z,Shit! I just noticed this is remake:) Sry guys.

,SativaMeAt420,2012-08-03T01:43Z,"We were experimenting with some pretty crazy things back then, not saying it happened or didn't but my Grandfather worked on a Naval destroyer during WWII and he said early one morning another ship passed by approx 1 mile away and as it passed through the fog the entire exterior of the ship glowed a pale green color, they had never seen anything like it before and within minutes of seeing the glowing ship they were all ordered by the President (of the USA of course) to remain silent, who knows what our military/government has and is working on, the technology that's available to the public today is capable of amazing things, just imagine what the military/government isn't telling us about, think about it. 

Regarding the movie, well its just not my cup of tea, crappy plot line, bad actors, old special effects, I got about 15min in and I just couldn't take any more.

Audio=8 Video=7 Movie=2"
,Fritz.,2012-08-03T01:52Z,"@fusionprospect  yes and hitler had a secret brigade of werewolves, and vampires have been secretly living among us for centuries, and the abominable snowman is hundreds of years old and quite adept at avoiding clear photography.

the internet doesnt make you stupid, it just shows it to the rest of the world.

The Philadelphia Experiment 
is a real event. and 2 of the scientist's most well known working on it were people like Nicola Tesla and Albert Einstein. 

Do some research children, don't make a fool out of yourselves.
