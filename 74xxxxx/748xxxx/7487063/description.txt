                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Follow-up to last year's documentary about Richard Wallace, whose chronic 
 hoarding made his Surrey home a virtual deathtrap, and his growing friendship 
 with Andy Honey, the landscape gardener who rallied his neighbours to help 
 clear 60 tonnes of rubbish from outside the bungalow. Six months later, the two 
 are still firm friends and trying to deal with the bigger problem of clearing 
 the inside of the property - but with Richard unable to let go of his clutter, 
 progress is slow and a local NHS mental health team is called in.

                                 Enjoy!
