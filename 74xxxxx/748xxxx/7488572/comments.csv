[T],Zoey_Redbird,2012-08-02T11:44Z,"Downloaded this and went to play One Foot. It says 160kbps, but sounded like it was 64kbps and upconverted through 10 different converters after being downloaded from YouTube with RealPlayer. Waited for the rest of the songs to download and they ALL sounded that horrible. They sounded like Emilie was holding a cellphone upside down in a tunnel and singing into it. Way too quiet and staticy. Not worth the time if you like being able to hear her music..However, if you don't like Emilie Autumn and just want some white noise that sounds like some whipsers of ESP shit are going on in the background, this is a GREAT album.
