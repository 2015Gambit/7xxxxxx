[T],SoulUploader,2012-07-29T07:28Z,"It should work for all Intel PCs seeing as Mountain Lion brought support for Ivy Bridge processors. There may be issues with old Intel processors though, as in Core 2 Duo. And Patrik the GM and Retail are exactly the same."

,scbjmshpv,2012-07-30T16:11Z,"does extraction work with other tools like powerarchieve or not? as it's not working for me
"
[T],SoulUploader,2012-07-31T00:38Z,"Use 7zip to extract, since that's what it was compressed with. All links should be working fine, perhaps the site was down for maintenance. "
,miguas2,2012-07-31T17:44Z,"So, you said it works on VMware Player.  I'm running VMware Player on Linux, will it work ? After watching the video tutorial thing it said I had to run the unlocker, is this the same for VMware Player in linux ? Is there one on the folder ?"

,panZ2,2012-08-28T20:51Z,Does this work in the Linux and OS X VMWare apps or is it Windows only? 
,qwertyacm,2012-09-16T06:17Z,"I can't seem to get this to boot in either Workstation 8.0.1 or Player 4.0.1.
I've extracted it, installed the Guest unlocker and have had no success. I'm running Win7 on AMD hardware. Any ideas?"
