Masterchef Allstars Season 1 Episode 3

All your favourite MasterChef contestants from seasons past, return to the MasterChef kitchen for the first ever MasterChef All Stars.

It wouldnΓÇÖt be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George.

Everyone loves a sausage sizzle, so the All Stars head to Fire and Rescue NSW State Training College to treat 100 trainees. This isn't going to be an ordinary sausage sizzle. 

Enjoy!
