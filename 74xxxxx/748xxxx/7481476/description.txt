Here is Disc 3 of 6 from Season One of the old 1960s CBC television series The Forest Rangers.  This is a full DVD.  It has been tested in a standalone player as well as on VLC player, and works perfectly.  Please be patient - I have a very slow upload speed, but do seed 24/7.  Please help seed.  The more help I get seeding the quicker I can get the rest of the discs up.  For those who are wondering about discs 1 and 2, these were put up on another site which is now down for an unspecified period of time.  They will eventually be posted here as well, but not until after discs 4, 5 and 6.
