I'm at 64.2% from the other site using DHT after the tracker went down, but all the seeders and peers disappeared a couple of hours ago. I was just looking for a way to try to contact you when I saw that you had uploaded it here. Do I need to use the torrent file from this site to continue, or will the other one just pick it up once people join the swarm?"
,Ecquillii,2012-07-28T05:03Z,"Yes! Everything picked up just fine without having to re-download anything. It's moving slowly, but I'm not in any rush. Thanks again!"
,Ecquillii,2012-09-10T23:54Z,"Goldielover56: Will Discs 4, 5, and 6 still be posted on this site? I'm watching Season One, Disc 1 at the moment and enjoying it immensely! I remember rushing home from school to watch this show, first in its serialized form on Razzle Dazzle and then when it got its own time slot. (This show was instrumental in forming my moral understanding of the universe--like who we are, and what we're supposed to do.) Never saw it since, so thanks for all your great work!"
