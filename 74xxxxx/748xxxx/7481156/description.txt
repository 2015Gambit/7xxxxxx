Cakewalk Boost 11

Boost 11 is a peak limiter that gives your final mix maximum volume and punch. With Boost 11's simple interface, you'll have your songs radio- and duplication-ready in no time at all.

The Boost 11 Peak Limiter provides transparent peak limiting and volume maximization without coloring the sound of the source material. Boost 11 employs a "look-ahead" limiter algorithm to prevent output clipping and PDR (Program Dependent Release) to minimize pumping (fluctuations of the volume) and maximize the loudness.
