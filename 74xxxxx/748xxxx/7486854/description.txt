House of Heroes is an alternative rock band from Columbus, Ohio. Though they are sometimes considered to be Christian rock, their lyrics are not always transparently Christian. In an interview with ransom.tv, Tim Skipper discusses their part in Christian music "We didn't feel drawn to necessarily be in the church and be a praise and worship band, and we didn't feel drawn to just be outside of it. We kind of felt like we should straddle the line, and the big deal was to keep the integrity of the music intact and not to sacrifice any of the artistry."
