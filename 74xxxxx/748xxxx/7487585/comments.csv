,FriendlySpidey,2012-07-30T14:27Z,"Remember the good old days when people weren't completely lazy and useless and could do things themselves? or you had to drive to the video store and pay?

From when I clicked on this torrent, to when I found it on imdb took less than 8 seconds. How lazy can you be?

scenebalance uploads dozens of movies every day, why not be appreciative? If its really such a struggle for you to type the 12 letters of the title in Google or IMDB to find out what the movie is about then I feel bad for you."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-07-31T15:30Z,"Well said FriendlySpidey , And furthermore  , it's funny how it's always the people that have never uploaded one single fucking thing that do all the moaning . 

Probably still being spoonfed by mummy ."
,mechfishy,2012-08-01T06:55Z,Really harsh comments.  What a bunch of dicks!  Ever notice that sometimes there might be several different videos with the same name?  Under those circumstances it is really courteous for the uploader to post a link to verify which video it is.  I understand that there is probably only one Snowmageddon.  But my point is still valid.  I always go to IMDB to check to see if it is what I think it is.  The only certain way to do this is if a link is posted.  
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-08-09T04:31Z,"@ mechfishy , no it's not really harsh at all ,   it's just the truth . as long as the uploader types the year after the movie there will be no mistakes . so as well as there being little chance of 2 snowmageddons , the chances of 2 snowmageddons in 2011 is a million to 1 . you see you have never uploaded ANYTHING either so you have no idea how long it takes . and some of these guys are uploading 30 , 40 , or more movies , tv programs a day . some don't have the time to do that AND put links up , while others have the time . BUT FOR LAZY BASTARDS WHO CAN'T BE ARSED TO CLICK IMDB FOR THEMSELVES , I HAVE NO SYMPATHY . "
