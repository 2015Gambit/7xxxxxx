,rugburn11,2012-07-28T18:12Z,"Aspect : 768 x 432 
This IS NOT HD

Come on dude WTF"
,tomer174,2012-07-28T18:13Z,i dont know why but its moving veruy slow. i have 200 mega and theres thousands of people in this torrent
,jimmcwibb,2012-07-28T18:27Z,"This is the BBC version. I watched the HD freeview stream and this looks worse quality, I suspect this is just normal SD freeview.

Also, the uploader has stamped their fucking website on the video every half hour or so, what a cock. No need for that."
,snipeyou,2012-07-28T18:30Z,Could someone upload this in 1080p?
,jimmcwibb,2012-07-28T18:30Z,"This is the BBC version but definitely not HDTV. I watched the HD version on the night and this is far worse quality. I suspect this is normal SD TV.

Also the video has a website stamped on it every half hour or so."
,BeachBeachBum,2012-07-28T20:18Z,People seed. This is ridiculous 
,jimmcwibb,2012-07-28T23:21Z,nobody is seeding this version because it sucks!

,neophius,2012-07-29T03:29Z,Who gives a shit when USA comes out. What were they Dressed in RIOT GEAR ready to false flag on the opening ceremony. WANKERS!! America should be kicked out of the Olympics for being such a mob of cheating Assholes.
,neophius,2012-07-29T03:30Z,Who cares America USA Suck dog nuts.
,alex179,2012-07-29T04:45Z,"America rules the world! Bow down or die, piece of shit foreigners!"
[T],xybrite,2012-07-29T05:11Z,"This is a very nice upload. 
It contains apparently BBC commentary. "
[T],xybrite,2012-07-29T05:12Z,@neophius - is clearly a born loser.
,sukr4m,2012-07-29T05:23Z,This video has the uploader's website showing in during the show. Try the 720p version. Much better.
,AMNetwork,2012-07-29T10:14Z,"Hey Guys I just bought the London 2012 Soundtrack from iTunes and I need you to help me seed this file.

,Trisste,2012-07-29T10:41Z,Thank you seeder from Slovakia for ~1 MB/s
,XilE-,2012-07-29T11:15Z,"This should be done but I refuse to watch the Olympics on TV or by download.

They give it out to the rest of the world for free then tell the USA to fuck off.. I will not support that one bit as it attacks the very foundation this nation is based on.

These criminals need locked up and I don't mean you guys downloading it I mean the assholes running the Olympics.

Fuck the Olympics. 
Long live The Pirate Bay."
,highlander888,2012-07-29T11:20Z,"Been trying to download this torrent for TWO DAYS now!

,jamilsahar,2012-07-29T18:25Z,Superb Work keep it up
,martyna01,2012-07-29T18:37Z,"Apparently it's SD TV, but I enjoyed it. It has BBC commentary, but it's not annoying. The name of the uploaders website didn't bother me. 
A:9
V:9"
,GPSman1,2012-07-29T19:41Z,I refuse to watch the Olympics live. Those money grubbing fucks have commercials every 2 min. I sure hope it's better for the ret of the world than the USA. And bob costas can go suck a dick. America has lost its way. 
,numse,2012-07-29T19:46Z,"get a fucking life!

dl porn"
,osriccc,2012-07-29T23:41Z,"FUCK with that website showing during the video. If not, it would be perfect... size, quality, etc... fuck."
,acsmith1972,2012-07-30T00:52Z,"I admit I'm not a huge fan of the Olympics, but I have to root for the U.S. =)"
,GeekinTX,2012-07-30T05:18Z,"Other than the self-promotion from the capper, this is awesome. Of all the opening ceremony versions I've downloaded, this one is the best. NBC and their censorship sucks. One from BBC Sports had terrible audio and the audio wasn't synced to the video - it was off by about 3 seconds by the end. One from EuroSport had even worse audio, which faded in and out, but the fireworks were loud - almost like they had microphones on top of the stadium. This one is A:10 V:10 from me, and I'll keep seeding it at least until the Olympics are over. Thanks!"

,ShinSakura,2012-07-30T22:24Z,I know I may not be only one O.o but that seeding hurts? and Download speed in on 1.5kbs D:
,3Dazz,2012-07-31T00:24Z,I've put up a 720p SBS 3D version in the 3D section for those who can play it.
,huckfinnifkcuh,2012-07-31T22:03Z,"Maybe we should all email the capper at the address on the screen, and ask politely if they can make a version available without the email address popping up... it screws up the audio every time it shows, and affects the video a slight bit as well..."
,Deathspanka,2012-08-03T11:41Z,Thanks from SWEDEN 
,Toolazytomakearealusernam,2012-08-05T15:28Z,"Great torrrent A-9 V-9
but it doesn't exsactly look like hd tv
also a very good size for and almost 4 hr ceremony"
,tleyden,2012-08-05T20:35Z,"Who gives a fuck about the Olympics, in two weeks no one will even remember the Athletes names. Our culture is so fucked up."
,danpatman17,2012-08-20T18:40Z,"It is cut, It is missing the James Bond and Queen opening to the whole ceremony."
