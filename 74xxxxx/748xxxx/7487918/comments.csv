,LemonJ-Lo,2012-07-30T16:25Z,"@janesteve:  You are not seeding long enough.  3 days is too short - look at the count of seeders and leechers on almost all of your torrents.  Only the smallest files show a large number of seeders.  All the rest show 0 or a small number.

This means you stopped seeding before anyone had a chance to get to 100%.

If you want to stop complaints about you, then do not post so many files, and let them seed for at least one week (or until you can see that -your- upload % is 200% or more."
