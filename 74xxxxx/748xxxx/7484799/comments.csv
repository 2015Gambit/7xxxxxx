Thanks"

Thanks"
,TEEllis22,2012-07-29T14:21Z,"Once you patch the app (By dragging and dropping the AirParrot app from your Application folder) copy the registration code (Generated in the keygen under the name ""Linezer0"", paste it in the registration field in the AirParrot app, click ""Register"" then you should be good to go.

,amulette,2012-08-09T19:26Z,"Hi OpenArena... The keyGen doesn't work under 10.6.8....  It's asking me to upgrade my OS, and to be honest, I was hoping not having to. Any chance that the key gen can be downgraded? Thanks!"
,shyscope,2012-08-20T21:24Z,"Hey, You say that the requirements for this is 10.6 or later. I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8 and it says that it needs 10.7 or later. Is there way around this, or can the keygen be downgraded? Thanks!"
