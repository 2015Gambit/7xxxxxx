are you doing simply so can have your name attached to the release ?

Also and more importantly i see you are not giving the groups the proper credit for their releases.
Believe it or not a lot of people want to know what they are getting and where it came from..

fuck the stupidity of TPB members never cease to amaze me !

Maybe i'll start doing the same damn thing.
I have a great idea i'll re-upload everything popular that was added the day before but I'll pretend *imply they came from me and delete any group names and add my own and then i'll keep doing that EVERY SINGLE DAY FOREVER !

Is that what TPB users want ?
Gimme a fucking break lol"

Piratecopy is OK, but also stealing the credit is just unfair.

,don2221949,2012-09-02T06:04Z,"BEWARE, I tried this and within 2 days an attempted sign in to my gmail accounts originated from Pakistan. I did a scan from a website that scans files for nasty stuff and this calls home to Pakistan. Do the research and you'll see what I mean. I had to change all my passwords for my email accounts. I'm glad I didn't do any online banking, I'd be in deep trouble. I bought the real Windows 7 and know I'm safe from these low life hackers!"
