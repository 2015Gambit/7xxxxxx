,frifrau,2012-07-30T07:14Z,"I would like these DLCs, too. 
Is it real or fake??

,sroy7710,2012-07-30T07:21Z,"radurall u have said that ""Notes:

You can play single player full game .""

Can it be playable on multiplayer ???"
,Machine4578,2012-07-30T12:23Z,this may include all of the DLC.. but there is NO CRACK to enable most of them.. only the original DLC that was released with the SKIDROW release are playable because thats the only crack available.. no update has been cracked to play new DLC!!!!!!!
,oHsHitsss,2012-07-30T14:45Z,DLC not works. Shit.

,abhi1423,2012-07-31T10:33Z,"@radurall
can u upload just the DLCs please"
,nyufi,2012-07-31T10:59Z,"As Machine4578 already said only those DLCs work that did before, meaning that the mission DLCs like Genki Bowl aren't unlocked, neither are the item DLCs after Bloodsucker. The game itself runs okay, but unless a new crack comes out it's not really worth to download if you already played the game."
,fragsnipa,2012-07-31T18:41Z,Nope no DLC like genki bowl or gangsta in space or trouble with clones.  I already have  a completed game save and there is no DLC that is unlocked.
