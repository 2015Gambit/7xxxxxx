Transformers Energon takes place after the events of Transformers: Armada. This series starts at issue 19 and picks up where Armada left off.

Earth's right back in the firing line as the great devourer strikes a deal with current Decepticon commander, Skorponok! What about Megatron? Well, trapped within Unicron as a disembodied Spark, his only hope is his former adversary... Optimus Prime! From Simon Furman and Guido Guidi!
