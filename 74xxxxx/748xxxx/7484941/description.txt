An encyclopedic collection free energy devices.  

I've only just discovered it, but it all looks terrifically well done.

Also it's available as a free e-publication from the author's website.

Also at the website are .pdf downloads of many of the free energy related

books that are available on TPB.

This guy is my new hero, and I'm reposting his material here in tribute,

to raise the profile of this important work.
