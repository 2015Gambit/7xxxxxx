To set the scene for the big-budget 2009 Bionic Commando remake on the current-gen consoles, Capcom produced this 30-page comic book detailing the events leading up to the imprisonment of the protagonist Rad Spencer and the enmity between him and Super Joe.

Originally available at the Bionic Commando website, this prequel comic isn't readily available anymore. I have packed the website version of the comic into .cbr to correct this problem. :)

I'm sorry, but the resolution (674x977) isn't what is generally expected of .cbr comics, because Capcom didn't appear to provide high-resolution versions of the comic on the site.
