Transferred and restored with Adobe Audition 3.0 at 32 Bit.
 (24 bit >32 bit >24 bit conversion is lossless, when the same algorithm is used in both directions. That's usually the case within single applications.)

P.S.: the LP has originally on S1 two Tex-Mex songs and a Chinese-like tune that have nothing to do
 with The Death Wish II soundtrack, I left them out.
