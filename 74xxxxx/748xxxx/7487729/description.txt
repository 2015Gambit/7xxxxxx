When running latest Adobe CS6 Portable products it may cause tempareory or even permenent error for ALL other Adobe product including Adobe Reader, FlashPlayer ect. While runnig Portable CS6, NONE of installed Adobe products works! I have found a fix for this issue and can run without causing errors any for existing Adobe products. Programs can be launched directly with Photoshop.exe or Illustrator.exe

The steps are included in the TEXT file, follow them.

If it works, please comment and SEED
