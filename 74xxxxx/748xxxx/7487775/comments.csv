,Shalmaneser,2012-07-30T15:05Z,Could someone post Olympics 2012 Equestrian / Dressage /3 Day Eventing? Thanks!
,3Dazz,2012-07-31T00:19Z,"We are only getting a few hours a day in 3D here, and I'm not really able to sit and wait for particular events. I only did this for the showpiece that it is. And our broad caster does'nt supply exact events and times."
,nigeltufnl,2012-07-31T05:02Z,Thanks for the upload 3Dazz. The quality is great - well done!
,Rodney538,2012-08-01T17:54Z,3Dazz...can you please upload some of the events?  My cable company is not able to activate the 3D on my box for some reason.  By the time they figure it out the Olympics will be over.  Thanks.
,3Dazz,2012-08-02T05:38Z,"Sorry, Rodney 538, but as I said, I only did the opening ceremony for the show that it is. We only get a few hours of 3D broadcast a day here and I,m not getting a schedule of what's on. Besides, the 3 parts that I did do took ages and I just dont have the time. I will however attempt the closing Ceremony."
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2012-08-02T16:30Z,"Thanks a lot 3Dazz. It was fantastic to first watch it in 3d! Hope you r able to get the closing ceremony as well.

PS Guys, at brazilian terra and also at their lantin america portal you can stream many 3d events. (not sure if it will work for people outside brazil though) www.terra.com.br"
,yrkeschaffis,2012-08-03T00:12Z,thank you 3dazz ... appreciate it...  my cable provider doesn't carry any 3D content... thanks a lot for this

NO INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION PART..

im downloading it ryt now, im at 52%. i noticed it doesnt show industrial revoulution part. IS IT TRUE? "
,jingsinger,2012-08-07T21:55Z,nd if the industrial part is not in 3D can u upload it in jst full hd only? it would be a real pain to download another 6gbs jst for the industrial revoulution part :-(
,3Dazz,2012-08-08T03:04Z,"@ jingsinger, the industrial revolution part of the show is definitely in this torrent, it comprises the 1st 20mins of the footage."
,jingsinger,2012-08-08T05:55Z,@3Dazz yaa thanks got it :-)
,oleblume,2012-08-08T08:53Z,The 3D effect is certainly there but video quality is bad
,oleblume,2012-08-08T08:55Z,"Its 3d allright, but very bad video quality"
,3Dazz,2012-08-10T03:23Z,"@ oleblume, I can only go by the amount of seeders and leechers to gauge the quality of this upload, but yours is the only negative comment. As I said, it looks and plays fine on my 47in Cinema 3D TV. The only thing I can suggest to help with your quality issue is try switching the left/right aspect, most all tv's can do this and try running directly from a pc via HDMI. I have found that trying either both or either has helped me with ""quality"" issues in the past."
,this_is_illegal,2012-08-13T06:01Z,"Hi, and thanks 3Dazz for that upload.
not to be bitching, but of ALL the formats to encode, u choose divx? not MKV, not MP4, not AVI, but FUCKING DIVX? I mean. who THE FUCK
still uses that shit? - now thanks to your kind
choice of a video container, I can't watch that
on my 3D phone! MP4 was fine man! MP4 was just fine! dunno what made you use DIVX!"
,Raj23,2012-08-21T00:06Z,"This is great 3Dazz..weldone.

I m one of the drummers in the opening ceremony and I have about 40 seconds in this recording. Thanx a TON for this.... Just wanted to ask u if the same recording was available in HD tht can be viewed on computer/laptops. Many thanks for this"
,3Dazz,2012-08-21T13:56Z,"@ this_is_illegal and Raj23, if you enter the search term ""London"" you should be able to find a copy of something that may suit your needs. I originally did this for myself and as DivX streams great from my server, thats what I chose to use, I'm sure if some of you are all up on the latest encoding software, you should have no trouble changing the format to suit your needs. I quite often see comments in this and other video sections where people are asking for AVI and DivX instead of mkv and MP4. But I suppose you cant please all of the people all of the time."
,Raj23,2012-08-22T18:47Z,"3Dazz . .  thanks a lot. But i guess tht i was not able to clearly say wht i meant.

I can see myself in the 3d version that u uploaded. The camera angles in ur 3d version are altogether different from the normal HD or BBC version that was shown in the UK.

So, i m requesting u if u cud guide me on how i can convert ur 3d file to a normal one that can be viewed on my laptop... thatz it mate. But thanks for this upload too. Now, I atleast have something to show to my children."
,3Dazz,2012-08-23T01:49Z,"@ Raj23, The only way I know of to view 3D SBS on a pc that does'nt have 3D screen is to use Cyberlink Power DVD 10 or 11. This program does work, but you will need those glasses with the Red and Blue lenses. Other than that I dont know of any other way to help. The image in this torrent is how I recorded it, it came as a SBS, and I dont think there is any way to convert it into a single image other than using a 3D tv or a PC with the above program."
