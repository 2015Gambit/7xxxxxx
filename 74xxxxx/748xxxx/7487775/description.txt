This a recording from TV of the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. This only goes until just before the athletes enter the stadium. It was recorded by PVR, the ads removed by Video ReDo (there might be green flashes where the ads were ) and joined and converted with DivX Pro. 
Frame size is 1280 x 720. Audio is Stereo. Works and looks like the original on my 47 in 3D TV. I'll up the rest in parts, as you can imagine, it's quite large and may take a while.
