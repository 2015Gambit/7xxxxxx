Not true 720 and the sound is no where near 5.1...still a good rip for the size. TY for up."
[V],YIFY,2012-08-01T03:13Z,"This is true 720p, and we dont use 5.1. we Encode all of our movies in 2 channel ( most people dont have a theater system , and most computers come with atleast 2 speakers.)"
,Asuzejo144,2012-08-06T16:58Z,"True true true! The people who complain about the sound is the kind that can afford to have a movie theather at home, so.. they can also afford to buy a blu-ray.  To all of them.. SHUSH!!"
