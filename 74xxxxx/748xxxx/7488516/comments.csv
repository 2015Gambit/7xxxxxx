[V],TorrentTracts,2012-07-30T17:46Z,"Super1313, I put up that Monk And Neagle discography for you just now.  They only have two releases.  A rather small discography.

But if there's anything else you would like to sample and add to your collection, please let it be known.  That's what I'm here for.  :)"
