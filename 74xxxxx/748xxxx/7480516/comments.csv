,soggal,2012-07-27T22:01Z,"Thanks so much for these many unloads, do you have any from Iv His Son, Jermaine Edwards, Jason Mighty, Jamaican artists?"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-07-27T23:02Z,"Soggal, unfortunately I don't have, nor have I ever heard of IV His Son.  I only have Jermaine Edwards's 2009 ""Destiny"" album.  And I only have Jason Mighty's 2008 ""Cornerstone"" album. Hardly the makings of a discography. :(

What other Jamaican artists are you looking got?"
