bands from st johns that I have recorded over that past few months on my hand recorder.

For these to sound good you need to boost the  highs on the EQ in your media player, but after that they sound mostly fine.

If any band has an issue being on this they can contact me through facebook, try not to spread this around too much.

weak link, be alright, drunks rule this place, monsterbator, kestrels, cetascean, asshole adult, new flesh, coach long legs, kick gut, bayward, reckoning force, the detained, public opinion, mixed messages, little things, bees and honey, pockethands, east of empire, cider squadron, clocked in, kill popoff, colonel craze and the hunch.

If you have video for one of these dates it would be cool if you synced it up with the audio from this after eqing it, because I sure as fuck am not going to.
