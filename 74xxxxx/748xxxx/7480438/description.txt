Plot: Some Days Are Better Than Others is Matt McCormickΓÇÖs poetic, character-driven debut feature-length film starring Carrie Brownstein (Portlandia) and James Mercer (The Shins) that asks why the good times slip by so fast while the difficult times seem so sticky. The film explores ideas of abundance, emptiness, human connection and abandonment while observing an interweaving web of awkward characters who maintain hope by inventing their own forms of communication and self-fulfillment. ItΓÇÖs a sad valentine to the forgotten discards of a throwaway society, and a story about knowing when to hold on, and when to let go.
