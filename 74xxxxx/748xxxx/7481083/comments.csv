,gilknut,2012-08-03T12:32Z,"Great work, but anyone know where the fuck last night's episode is? I don't get it, I've looked everywhere online -- usually it's up several hours ago. Same with ""Wilfred"". :/"
,akosiroel,2012-08-03T12:56Z,"gilknut, I was wondering the exact same thing. The latest episodes of Louie and Wilfred should have been up hours ago! What's going on?"
,tisk,2012-08-03T14:23Z,"Curious about last night's shows too!!
Normally all the crews race for the first upload and now nothing. Wonder what is going on there. Did FX invent the ultimate piracy protection...lol"
,tisk,2012-08-03T14:26Z,Weirdly enough I just saw an anger management torrent from eztv (horrible show) and that airs right before... just saying...
,tom255,2012-08-03T16:58Z,"Wha Tha Faa??

I KNOW RIGHT? I've been looking everywhere, and not a sausage.

Has anyone got ANY answers?!"
,jeffwin,2012-08-03T17:17Z,"Still no Wilfred or Louie anywhere, I'd appreciate any answers as well! Thanks.."
,PPierce34,2012-08-03T20:01Z,I'd like to add my WTF to these comments. I need my new Louie and Wilfred and they are nowhere to be found!
,akosiroel,2012-08-04T01:33Z,Okay so I wake up to find that all the usual Louie and Wilfred torrents are already here. That's a relief because I was f-ing panicking there for a second. But I'm still very curious about the delay...
,akosiroel,2012-08-04T01:54Z,"Oh and by the way, though there might not be as much fans of it out there (I know I am), but the latest Brand X with Russell Brand is still nowhere to be found. It's also part of that Thursday night FX lineup. So what the f*** is up?"
,PPierce34,2012-08-04T04:48Z,Who cares that all the old episodes are still here? We've watched and deleted them each week. Where is the new #^%$#@$%%$!!!???
,noisyland,2012-08-14T13:15Z,All I can say is: A BIG THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
