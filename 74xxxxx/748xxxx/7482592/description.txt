Frogatto is an open-source ΓÇ£platformerΓÇ¥ game, which means youΓÇÖre given a cross-section view into the world, and you help a small green fellow named Frogatto walk and jump between solid footholds whilst you lead him through his story.  ThereΓÇÖs a long history to the genre, so just by being in it we inevitably have a lot in common with other games, however, weΓÇÖre not trying to clone any specific game.
