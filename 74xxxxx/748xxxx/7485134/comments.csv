I know a bit of quality may be compromised but I believe ultimately in the GB/benefit analysis , it works out better and it is more practical. Lamhe is my most favorite movie but still I would not go to download it because of 10 GB.Pls see if you can use a better compress method and make ur gr8 uploads more practical.Thanks !"
