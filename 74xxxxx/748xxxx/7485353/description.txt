When IndiaΓÇÖs leaders envisaged building a new nation after Independence, the Constitution was the foundation stone of this endeavour. We had resolved to establish a sovereign, secular, democratic republic with justice, liberty, equality and fraternity for all. Enough Indians have been putting these principles into action, that the country can find hope to awaken into a ΓÇÿheaven of freedomΓÇÖ. 

But, will we try our level best to follow the path laid down by the Constitution of our country?
