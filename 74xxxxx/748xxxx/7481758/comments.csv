Besides the game sucks. Fifa is way better. I dont know y they keep making this game even though fifa is the greatest game in the world"

Many people like me do not like to enter the xboxlive precisely by the fact that is pirated.
And PES is cool too both games are good Fifa and Pes."

,mohammadjl,2012-08-02T00:50Z,"downloaded it. The speed of the download was pretty good but the thing is, after the download finished I copied it into a usb and plugged the usb into my JTAG'd xbox. I copied the files to content -> 0000000000000000. the game appeared in my ""Xbox 360 games"" but when I try to launch it, it freezes and doesn't work.. any suggestions?"
,CrematoryKid,2012-08-02T22:45Z,@mohammadjl ...i believe u shuld burn it into a dvd(4.7) using ImageBurn with some special instruction to make a xbox dvd game...ur console shuld be flashed (LT.03) ..when u use the dvd dont play it from the dvd itself...u ll find an icon (PES2013)in quick play partation...it will work fine then
,XspicyX,2012-08-08T05:48Z,"i have an issue... i have downloaded it and tried to use image browser but it comes up with ""can not determine what xbox disk type"" any ideas?"
