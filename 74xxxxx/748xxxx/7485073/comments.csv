America voted on who won, so it's basically just a reveal, so they made it a re-union/finale/reveal kinda deal.

Agreed, still struggling to understand why was encoded with 64kbps audio - not my caps man, just upping what i found on the glorious www"
,VeKTeReX,2012-08-15T18:47Z,"Thanks for the info, i purposely didn't watch what i thought was the reunion show because i didn't want to get tipped off as to who the winner was.

The audio is a wonder, but the bigger wonder to me was why there is only the one S08E11 version laying around while the other episodes have well more than one.

Thanks again"
