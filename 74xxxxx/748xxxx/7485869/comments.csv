,Kreiri,2012-07-29T20:22Z,why do some people insist on splitting everything into hundred parts...
,pagaldeewana,2012-07-29T21:28Z,Thanks for the upload...........
,thellama,2012-07-29T23:01Z,"Download is slow, but the sample looks good so far."
,shredddd,2012-07-30T00:44Z,"Please please seed! This appears to be the best version of the opening ceremony floating around so far. Great video/audio quality judging from the sample, and recorded on BBC (fuck NBC) with no commentary."
[M],DeeLee,2012-07-30T02:32Z,"this must be more than just the Opening Ceremony?
Its so damn long."
,hayamax,2012-07-30T04:17Z,"Slow as hell. But by the comments, I'll give a chance. Thanks!"
,shredddd,2012-07-31T01:59Z,"Second comment here. I finished the download and here's what you should know:

- Video/audio quality: 10/10!
- This video also includes the BBC's follow-up to the opening ceremony, thus the longer run time than other releases.
- There IS commentary in the video, however it is not often and not too disruptive, and it's a LOT better than NBC's coverage, that's for certain."
,grochibre,2012-08-01T20:51Z,"V/A: 10
The BBC commentaries are still too disruptive, it's really a pity because the music of the show is very good. "
[M],DeeLee,2012-08-05T15:10Z,"The opening starts at 02:03:10! You can skip forward to that time!

It feels so fake with the niggers, and in various ways, handicapped 
people. They dont belong in the Opening Ceremony. They feel forced into
it. Like they have to have them in the ceremoney but they dont want
that.

It was good but some boring parts. I skipped those."
