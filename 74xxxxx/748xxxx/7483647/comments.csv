While the commentary was very good, the sound of the music and official annoucers was just BAD... Eurosport - you can not treat viewers like that!!!"
,rigmar_radio,2012-07-29T01:46Z,I can confirm on this torrent the BBC will NOT let you down...  Brilliant.. brought tears to my eyes and made me very proud for Great Britain.
,Klaatu1957,2012-07-30T01:50Z,Not happy.  25GB downloaded and it is ONLY in Russian.  I have tried 4 different players and none of them can find any other audio streams.  Very unhappy about the waste of bandwidth.
,Klaatu1957,2012-07-30T02:47Z,Good grief.  I finally found a player that would play the English track... and it is someone doing an English translation of the Russian commentary from the sound of things.  The commentary is dreadful.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR BANDWIDTH
,mnvsg321sdaf1,2012-07-30T04:52Z,"This does include commentary in English (try opening in VLC and changing audio tracks if you can't find it). HOWEVER, it's the Audio Description version rather than the normal commentary. 
Picture quality is great but wish it could be uploaded with proper English commentary!"
