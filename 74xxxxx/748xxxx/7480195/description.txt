Very rare, much sought-after Mobile Fidelty Sound Lab edition of two early Beach Boys albums, in absolutely fantastic sound. "In My Room" sounds as though you were in the studio during the recording. These BB sessions were the last produced in stereo for some time, as Brian Wilson soon took over the controls and worked for mono releases.
