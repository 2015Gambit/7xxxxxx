My Player Database for FM12,the latest Moskollo DB is updated to include transfers upto and including 28/7/12, (includes a number of changes to lower English leagues since my last update). This is just the database so should bequick download.

Idone as many transfers as I can, I do focus on the English leagues on my games, will seed for as long as possible.

Put the moskollo DB files into your 'my documents/sportsmanager 2012/editor data folder and then when starting a new game select moskollo db.


Peace and enjoy,
