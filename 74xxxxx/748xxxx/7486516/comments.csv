[V],azizex666,2012-07-30T01:41Z,"@realpr
Thanks! :)"
,limeyguy33,2012-07-30T02:16Z,Thank you very much for the excellent upload.
[V],dynstab2,2012-07-30T03:11Z,Max length of torrent titles on TPB is 64 characters. And not all characters of the short ASCII map are allowed in listings (e.g. ampersand). And you have to beg (twice!) on SuprBay to be able to edit a posting. Worst of the worst?
,Fleck99,2012-07-30T11:27Z,"Great share, thanks!"
,lectruck,2012-07-30T14:15Z,"Woot!!!!  Great lit, good job!!!!"
,chromepony,2012-07-30T18:06Z,Some books cannot be opened because the Titles are not valid.  Any way to fix this problem?  Perhaps you can rename them before creating the torrent and repost them.  Please.  CP
[V],azizex666,2012-07-30T18:46Z,"@chromepony
which books?
could you gimme the names, Thanks."
[V],azizex666,2012-07-30T19:58Z,"@chromepony
I just went thru all 221 books and they all open fine.I use kindle app for pc for mobi and adobe digital edition for epub, calibre also works.

You might be trying to open the metadata files that end in .opf"
,chromepony,2012-07-31T00:46Z,"Thanks for the quick reply.  I'll download it and try again.  I tried to add the patterson books, among others, to my Calibre and it wouldn't take them citing ""improper title"".  I'll let you know how I make out this time.  CP"
[V],azizex666,2012-07-31T03:00Z,"@chromepony
just double checked the patterson books also on calibre, everything is working fine. I'm using latest version of calibre btw version 0.8.62."
,chromepony,2012-07-31T03:09Z,"I downloaded the file again with the same results.  Almost all the titles, when I try to add them to my Calibre program either say ""Invalid Title"" or if I try to add the whole folder it says ""Empty Folder"".  I've downloaded over 4000 books from here and added them to my Calibre so I'm sure I'm doing it right.Don't know what else to say.  I really only need a few of the books on your list so I'll just wait until they are u/led seperatly.  Really appreciate your work, hope others don't have the same problem as I am.   CP"
[V],azizex666,2012-07-31T04:02Z,"can you shorten those book names before adding them to calibre and see if that works, lemme know how it goes, Just a thought."
,realpr,2012-07-31T04:05Z,I did not have any problems . Added all the books to Calibre ...went as smooth as knife through butter ....once again GR8 upload azizex666 !!
,bjmassni,2012-07-31T16:42Z,"I really want this torrent, but everytime my Ares says ERROR, this is the only torrent that has EVER gave me an error, and I have downloaded millions. Why is this? My Ares is up to date, I have tried restarting, I have tried everything, what is going on? :("
,chromepony,2012-07-31T16:59Z,"I downloaded the whole torrent again and created another Calibre library that was empty.  I moved the whole download to it and got 162 books only.  Of the books not transferd to Calibre were the following.

Numbers   4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 15 - 18 - 56 - 69 - 73 - 78 - 84 - 111 - 114 - 

154 - 168 - 170 - 172 - 173 - 177 - 183 - 186 - 187.  These books are in the download but wonât transfer or open with any of the readers I have.  Sorry about this but itâs a mystery to me why it happens, but it did.  Thanks for your help.  CP"
[V],azizex666,2012-07-31T17:21Z,"@bjmassni
Think its due to the file names being very long.
I plan to keep em short for the future uploads."
[V],azizex666,2012-07-31T17:23Z,"@chromepony
which calibre version are you using and did you try renaming them with shorter titles?"
[V],azizex666,2012-07-31T17:27Z,"Sign up on Superbay (TPB forums) and send me direct PM's pls (same user name as here), here takes a while for the comments to show up."
,changly,2012-07-31T23:20Z,loving this NYT best sellers series :)
,yuuup20,2012-08-01T02:56Z,"I too could not read many of the books in this offering.  when i right-clicked to move them into another file, it would not allow me.  when i clicked on the jpg, within the file, an error message said file could not be viewed.

i tried downloading twice, same result...and i really wanted to read that Catherine Coulter book."
