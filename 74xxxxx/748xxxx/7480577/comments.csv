,Ridindirrty69,2012-07-28T02:53Z,"So with those subtitles, how do i get them to work when i play through my media player on my tv? Save them in the same folder as the movie or....?"
,monster.x,2012-07-28T10:04Z,"depending on your player that should be enough, worst case use http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html these tools to insert the subtitle files into the mkv container"
,Ridindirrty69,2012-07-28T15:36Z,"ok cool, thanks for the help :D"
,.Leto.,2012-07-31T02:46Z,"If you're looking for hyper-violent and mindless action you're going to love this :)
But I have to say that I had never seen such stupid cops in a movie before. They're invading a full building with just 20 people, they don't hide, don't take cover. As a result almost all of them are getting slaughtered like pigs right at the beginning :D
I saw on IMDb that there might be a US remake, there's no way you're going to see this level of hyper-violence in a US movie.
About picture quality it's a bit strange. Everything looks colourless, all colors are dull.
BTW I've also downloaded the zektorm version, it's a total disaster. That guy must be blind to release shit like that.
Anyway, great action movie. Although the end of Hard Boiled (John Woo), when they're invading the hospital, is way better than this."
,vivatpb5776,2012-08-13T17:27Z,Excellent video quality. I used the subtitles that BOZX offered and replaced the Chinese subs with the English subs using MKVMerge.
,joe165841,2012-08-14T23:39Z,Good job Leto. Action movies aren't' supposed to be realistic. If they were realistic they'd be fucking boring. Idiot.
