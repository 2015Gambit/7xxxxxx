,antignor,2012-07-29T06:37Z,"Here we go again. Stupid people who think they can relate evolution by NATURAL selection with social darwinism (chapter 16), i.e. nazism, eugenics and alike. People doing this are just as badly wired up in their brains as people who did this in the past with all horrific consequences and have understood Darwin just as well as those dangerous and mentally ill people in the past.

Evolution has NO social consequences. Biological evolution is a natural process, not a philosophy of life. Just because religion is philosophy of life doesn't make scientific observations and theories that contradict the bible (which I'm sure this book can't refute, otherwise I'd have known about it already) the same.

""Chapter 1: Revelation and the Authority of Scripture"". This is to hit the reader with fear to make them more vulnerability to the faulty argument they're going to get presented. It'll be telling the reli-sheep that the bible says the bible is the word of God, so therefor the bible is the word of God. If You doubt the circular reasoning you're going to burn in hell for eternity. Why? Because the bible says so, and because the bible tell you that the bible is the word of god it's the true word of god...

I'm going to stop here before I can't stop anymore. I've got better things to do you know."
,lectruck,2012-07-29T14:04Z,"Wooh... look is is the closed minded narrow minded shallow ""intellect"" who does not know how to look at  or for the truth and will believe anything, especially if it has no basis of fact... Evolution is that religion today.  Science has proven that nothing can arise from nothing, Life cannot come from no where.

Learn the fact and see true science as it really is, not colored by blind hatred for facts.  The Moslems and Christians both know where we came from, and the evidence is clearly visible, look into it."
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-07-29T17:27Z,"Grimm wrote all kinds of scripture about pigs, bears, wolves, witches, gingerbread houses, and old women who lived in shoes.

By the same logic that ""proves"" creationism by reference to other fairy tales (er, scripture), all of Grimm's works must be taken as truth too, right?

Or is there some fundamental difference between religious scripture (from the imaginations of men and written by the hands of men) and fairy tales (also imagined and written by the hands of men) that makes one true and the other not?"

""the closed minded narrow minded shallow ""intellect""??
So you'd claim the religious folks who claim the stone and bronze-age sheep-herder interpretations of the world and universe to be the truth are open minded? Scientific interpretations of observations are always open to change. You'd have to come up with serious evidence though. The bible is not considered to be evidence, no matter how high you jump, it will never be that way. What science has show is that the biblical accountof creation can't have happened as it is written and that if you like it to go hand in hand with science you'd have to corrupt most of the creation account and its sequence.

You seem to seriously lack knowledge of the scientific method. You're the one who should do some learning besides reading the bible and the quran. Then you'd know that science is fundamentally different from religion, theories can change, but you have to come up with scientific evidence. It's the bible and the quran that can never change.

But by comparing the theory of evolution to religion you admit to your own religion not being true. You use the atheist/gnostic argument that religion is only based on beliefs, not on evidence, and mirror this to use it against science. So if the theory of evolution is not fact based, as you falsely claim with your argument, than you admit to your religion not being fact based, which is a factual truth.

""nothing can't come from nothing"". This is a logic joke. You made this up yourself? It made me LOL :-) Nothing equals nothing so nothing doesn't have to come from nothing for nothing to exist. If nothing could exist that is.

But science has not 'proven' something can't come from nothing (this is what you meant to say I suppose). Have you ever heard of quantum fluctuations? Entire universes might come from them. It's not scientifically proven, but the math shows it could. Enjoy the ride! And no scientist or any other ""shallow intellectual"" will ever claim that life came from nowhere. That's just another religious fallacy. Life emerged from chemical evolution. Chemical components are not nothing. Don't say ""now who created these chemicals"", because then you still defy the biblical claim that all species are separate creations and evolution didn't happen. Chemical evolution emerged from cosmological evolution.

Now you show you're not the closed minded narrow minded shallow unintellectual religious believer you've shown to be in your comment.

,shamanist,2012-07-30T01:01Z,"@lectruck--  Dude, how many times did you have to icepick yourself in the head to vomit up that tripe? You have shown that you know squat for science, logic and reason. You show that you are blinded by your faith and unable to think outside of your self-imposed box. You make the assumption that two faiths that arose from the Middle East are the real truth-holders and profess it as fact. If the Vedas are right or Buddha was right, then you are an even bigger fool. As an old person, let me pass a bit of advice on: It is better to remain silent and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. Cheers!"
