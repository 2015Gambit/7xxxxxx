,illizit,2012-08-23T06:25Z,"r u sure its stuck? on my pentium 4 w/ 7600gs it would take like 3 mins to load, phenom ii w/ radeon 6670 takes like 30secs. could be other things to affect it (ram, fragmentation) "
,Aesawe,2012-08-25T17:36Z,"I only registered so that i can comment here and tell you that this Torrent fucked up my game. Gods and the Kings is not working,it launches but then it starts poping out texture errors every minute and the game is unplayable,so i downloaded the link @illizit provided and it fucked up my main game too,so yea thanks for fucking up my game,my download speed is 140kb/s so i won't be playing it for a while now thanks to you ."
,Aesawe,2012-08-25T17:42Z,Did you really just remove my comment ? You're pathetic .
,Aesawe,2012-08-25T17:43Z,"Oh no you did not remove my comment,it just did not display for some reason ,but screw you anyways for fucking up my game."
