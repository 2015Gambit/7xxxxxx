Description

Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.
It is being used in planetarium projectors. Just set your coordinates and go.

The Stellarium team announces the release of Stellarium .

This is a bug fix release. We closed more 30 bugs in the main application and in the plugins and also small improvements of GUI. A huge thanks to all community bug reporters who helped us a lot finding bugs!

Bundle for Mac OS X will be published on next week, packages for Linux and Windows you can freely download from SourceForge.net and/or Launchpad.net.
