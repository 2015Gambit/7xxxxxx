bro,i well fear that your isp is blocking any of your peer to peer activities or you seriously need to learn how doing torrent but the problem is that you are useless on this seed and bother the other peer as well.
So please,try to find a quick solution or abort and disconnect of this seed so.
Ty for your understanding
Btw,i repeat again !!!
Don't use 80 port,because this last one is reserved only to most udp trackers and you might be banned from if you don't change of external port.
