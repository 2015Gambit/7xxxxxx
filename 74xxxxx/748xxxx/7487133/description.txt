Install 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and copy the PMDG_737NGX.dll to your FSX main directory usually 
c:Program Files(x86), Microsoft Games, Microsoft Flight Simulator X, Gauages File. Copy and replace it.


Enjoy :)

This package was put together by myself. It is the way I have been able to have the NGX work for me in my simulator. 
I have used installer 4,5 and 6 and crack from Tmoos. Instsaller 1 and 2 is by ALEF1995rest.

These guys have done all the work, this is just what worked for me and I hope it works for you.

My system is Win7 64bit.

The only trouble it gave me was to my LVLD 767, but a re install fixed that.
