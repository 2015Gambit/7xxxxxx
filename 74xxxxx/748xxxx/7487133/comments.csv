,_SnakEye,2012-08-01T16:51Z,"@JWJD, 1st of all thanks for the U/L, however it is not a good thing to Upload a torrent that is already here in the TPB as it would cause a split seeding which would eventually lead for both torrents to die.
Please pay attention next time and make sure the Torrent you are Uploading has not been Uploaded before.

I have been running this without any problems and i really appreciate it. I just wanted to point out that no 6. (patch from 1.0.292 to 1.0.3x) is actually meant to be no3 which is the next patch after the first patch is applied. Also wanted to let you all know that i have uploaded a full set of liveries for the NGX, here is the link:
