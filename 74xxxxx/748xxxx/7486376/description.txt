Dr. Chud's X-Ward was formed in 2003 after Dr. Chud folded his other band Graves. Their first CD was released in 2004, it was released on Dr. Chud's very own Bloodwork Records label, it was named Diagnosis for Death. The first 1000 copies of Diagnosis For Death are limited edition and were signed, numbered, and came with a free vinyl sticker. In 2005 it was released on purple vinyl. Only 1250 were released. Every Halloween the band goes on tour.
