,xpmule,2012-07-31T18:17Z,"I'd be faaaaaaar more concerned with these so called changes Anonymous made.

If people are too lazy to install / removesoftware on their own OS then you deserve what you get lol"
,cgtu45,2012-07-31T19:53Z,"... and it means if you continue spit on my work
this must be my last upload, so help yourself.
There is no many thing like this, any way, and 
116 download and 3 seed for now. I am no more
anonymous anyway, so tel me what you got,
smarties."
,xpmule,2012-08-01T06:39Z,"next time don't upload as anonymous ?
also if there are ""so many like this"" why did you bother uploading ?

And who the hell are you and why should people trust you to pre modify their Operating System ?
Any experienced pirate wouldn't touch something like this with a 10 foot pole
and its nothing personal either.
Its just a bad concept.."
,cgtu45,2012-08-01T08:15Z,"... and you are not have to, there are others who
trust. Nobody is forcing you. End of discussion 
with people who are judging, not downloading and
trying. "

,cgtu45,2012-08-05T14:42Z,"My idea was to remove every application that is intended for touch screens so you can test and use OS in old fashion way: like XP, WIN 7. Most of metro apps are nice and fine, but we like apps in old way, yes ?
 Many people are testing betas or new apps on old computer, or on second computer
and it is smart choice. Not to make mess on your PC , just try new software. Old p-4 is a good choice but it
runs slow with new windows. You have to remove unneeded services and programs, but it must remain functional. Next thing to do is get back the start menu. It is integrated in installation so you can only update it if you want. Many people are confused with new metro start menu so this is a good way to use and test new OS . Then there is a fact that most people are very happy with win7 and winxp and smart choice is not change something that is stable. In other hand, new OS is logical choice for a new hardware , tablets .
I am saying again, this is nice and quick and easy install all in one package, but there is no activator for
this and IT IS STILL-----B E T A ! So relax, you install and use new OS on your PC or laptop and it works
very fast and stable, but it expires in start 2013. 
You can see that there is no watermark at all so it says ""windows 8"" , not ""r.p."" It is cosmetic, but it looks better. It is not tested in virtual machines but it should work. I am testing on HDD, just in case...
First start comes all in black but you can change it in normal colour schema, no problems. 
If you download the picture first you can see it is a screenshot of system properties, dvd contents and desktop, all together . Rewrite serial . It is boot dvd , just burn and have fun. 
For older ATI x550-x600 radeon it is integrated original driver so you can use direct-x on video.
It means max performance on older video hardware. If you need drivers go to Driverpacks website.
Most of win7  drivers are working with this beta. It also works on older hard drives so you can use
old ata 40 gig, for example. 
It is tested to run from usb stick 16 gig, you need HIRENS BOOT CD 15, first format with usb format utility,
then run program Win6.x instaler. It is interesting experience to put your windows disk in pocket, yes?
     I can write many things but conclusion is: i am using this little monster most of my time spent on computer and it is really fine. DO NOT use this for sensitive ""operations"" , my advice .Hide your IP first.
Thanks for your interest . Hope it helps you, good luck !"
