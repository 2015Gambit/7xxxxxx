From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, about efforts by the government to roll back the Second Amendment, the United Nations playing possum after its small arms treaty was tabled last week, and comments by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia about the inevitability of gun control in the United States. 

Alex also talks with Julio Rausseo, an independent journalist based in Chicago. Rausseo produced a video documenting a TSA checkpoint at Chicago's Union Station.
