,Ludwig55,2012-07-30T15:57Z,"@ Keka2:
Virginia is born in April 1991.
I don't know the day.
Russian People have 3 Names: the family name, the christian name (e.g. Virginia), and the father's name. They normally use only the 2nd name (= christian name or nickname) and the 3rd name (=father's name). THat's why the 2nd name of Virginia is Virginia...
I'm sure You asked for the family name (1st name) and father's name (3rd name) ... - I don't know them,but if someone knows: I'm interested, too."
