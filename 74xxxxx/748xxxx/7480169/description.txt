This HALO Trilogy has all the cut scenes of all 3 halo games put together as one long movie. i bought the Halo 3 Legendary Edition and i did not like how they made the dvd. in the Halo 3 Legendary Edition they had in game play with the cut scenes, witch was a wast of time. also the quality of the Halo 3 Legendary Edition cut scenes where low quality. non of the Halo 3 Legendary Edition was used to make this DVD. i ripped all the cut scenes my self. when i put all the cut scenes together, i was surprise to see how well it came out. its like watching a movie not a game. the story runs smoothly. this HALO Trilogy also has all halo3 cut scenes (and more) (Halo 3 Legendary Edition does not have that). if you don't like games and want to know what the whole HALO thing is, this HALO Trilogy will tell you everything about HALO and if you are a HALO fan this is a must for you

With HALO 4 around the corner this is a great way to catch up

i sent a lot of time on this. i hope you enjoy it
