Bomber Command
This new documentary tells the incredible story of some of the only men in the British forces not to receive a campaign medal for their efforts in the Second World War. Just days after Her Majesty The Queen finally unveils a memorial in London's Green Park to honour the 55,573 men of Bomber Command - half their total number - who lost their lives in the war, this hour-long documentary meets some of the last surviving men who fearlessly led air missions over Adolf Hitler's Germany. It follows the journey of Bomber Command airmen through the Second World War from their arrival at RAF bases to the controversial bombing of Dresden. Some argue that the courageous men of Bomber Command - responsible for the bombing of Germany's industrial heartlands and the Dambusters raid - were among the greatest fighters of the war. Yet snubbed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, they were some of the only men in the entire Armed Forces not to receive a campaign medal.
