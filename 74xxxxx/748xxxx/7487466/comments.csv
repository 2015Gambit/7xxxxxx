You can download all the BBC 1 and BBC 2 coverage of the Olympics using get_iplayer.

The files are available for 7 days after transmission in 640x360 or 832x468 MP4 format.

I'm capturing these cycling torrents from the 24 dedicated sports HD channels that the BBC have setup. These programmes aren't available on BBC iPlayer.

If you live outside the UK you'll first need to configure a VPN to get a temporary UK IP address. You can use the ExpatShield's VPN to do this. Then install get_iplayer and download the files directly from the BBC servers."
