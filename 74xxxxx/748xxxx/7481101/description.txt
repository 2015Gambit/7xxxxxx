Inventor Professional: Added Tools for Simulation, Routed Systems, and Plastics

Extended Capabilities for Plastic Mold Design, Routed Systems Design, and Integrated Motion Simulation and Stress Analysis

Autodesk┬« Inventor┬« Professional 3D CAD software can help you design, visualize, and simulate a more complete digital representation of your end product. It includes all of the core 3D mechanical design, CAD productivity, and design communication functionality of Autodesk Inventor plus extended capabilities for:


1. Optimizing and validating with integrated simulation tools, minimizing the need to
   test the design with physical prototypes

2. Designing routed systems of complex tube and pipe runs

3. Electrical cable and harness designs

4. Creating tooling for manufacturable plastic parts



This is the compressed installer from Autodesk site. For some reason, my first attempts to http downloads from their server were corrupted. So, I'm making this torrent to help others who are having same problem.

This installer can be used for 30-day trial period, or with commercial or student product key and serial. The student product key is available free for students at Autodesk site.
