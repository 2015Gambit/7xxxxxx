A note from joeyverbeke.

This torrent contains my release: Hypercube EP. I am trying my best to make this accesible to everyone as easily as possible, and so of course creating a torrent popped into my head. Don't feel as though you are cheating me out of anything by downloading this, you are supporting me by giving my music a chance. So enjoy the EP and share it with any of your friends that you think would enjoy it. It is a composition containing a summation of everything that I have learned thusfar in my musical endeavors. Hit play, close your eyes, and experience a segment of existence in the fourth dimension.

If you enjoy the EP enough that you feel like donating some money that will go towards production of future tunes, you can go here: http://joeyverbeke.bandcamp.com/album/hypercube-ep You'll be able to download the EP in any format (WAV, FLAC, etc.) you'd like, and also get the .mp4 of the video for the first song Tesseract.

Thank you and enjoy,
