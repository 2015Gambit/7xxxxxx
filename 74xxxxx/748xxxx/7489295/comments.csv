,xxdocxx,2012-07-31T01:43Z,@friendlySpidey like it says in the description these have been ripped from other torrents. I don't know why it still says they are vob files ( Season 5) they have already been converted to avi. Do you see anywhere that i say these are dvdrips. and yes season 4 are tvrips.
,xxdocxx,2012-07-31T01:55Z,@friendleySpidey Yes there is an issue with season 4 if i can find a fresh one i'll try and reupload thanks for the heads up
,xxdocxx,2012-07-31T02:17Z,sorry folks i'll have a dvdrip of season 4 within the next couple of weeks. I'll post a link here when i get it sorry for the inconvenience.
