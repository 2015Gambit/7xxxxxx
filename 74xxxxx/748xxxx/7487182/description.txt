Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics (a pun of the literacy program Hooked on Phonics) is the debut studio album by Canadian musician Devin Townsend. It is a metal/punk rock parody concept album written by Townsend. Cooked on Phonics tells the story of a fictitious death metal band from south-central Poland called Cryptic Coroner that sells out their metal look and sound to become a commercial punk rock band called Punky Brüster (the band's name is a pun on the 80's U.S. television series Punky Brewster). It was released on Townsend's label, HevyDevy Records, on March 19, 1996.
