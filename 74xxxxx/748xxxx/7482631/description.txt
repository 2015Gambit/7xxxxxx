HI ! After downloading you can just extract to a folder and then open SETUP and Install the game 
                                      OR
Open PowerISO then open the file with it then mount it then OPEN My Computer then on CD Drive (x:) right click then open and OPEN INSTALL

         DURING THE INSTALL IF ANY BOX APPEAR CLICK ON IGNORE

                           AFTER THE INSTALLINATION
Open the Iso file or RAR file, you will see a folder CRACK open it copy the file GTA_SA to your GTA san andreas game directory and paste it then open the game and

                                     ENJOY
