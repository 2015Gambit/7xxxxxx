Thanks for considering the donate version of "Screen Off and Lock".
This tools allows you to switch off and lock screen by 1 click with screen off ANIMATION and SOUND effects.
THIS IS NOT A WIDGET!

 You can place the shortcut in anywhere and customize the app icon and its label! (i.e. using ADW Launcher or LauncherPro)

You can click the shortcut in notification bar, put it into your dock of your launcher or long pressing the search key to switch off the screen and lock your device!

This donate version will EXIT COMPLETELY and FREE UP all the used memory after the screen is turned off or locked.
