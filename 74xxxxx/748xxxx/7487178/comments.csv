THANK YOU!!!!!"
,heatle,2012-07-30T09:55Z,"don't get too excited everyone, it has been at 0% for me since he uploaded bc there are 0 seeders despite the description :( "
,kelleytoons,2012-07-30T11:39Z,"Maybe someone will load a higher res version -- hey, there are all the WOMEN'S basketball games upped here.  Where are all the real basketball fans?"
[V],Nepotu,2012-07-30T13:47Z,"First, thank you all and you're welcome!
@nikita566: Thank you. I was always here, you have not :)
@kelleytoons: It's a good copy to see on a PC. I can't up higher resolutions from my own torrents because with my small bandwidth (max. 80 kB/s) will take days.
@all: If you ppl want more olympic BB games, please tell me what games and I see what can I do"
,necr00,2012-07-30T15:43Z,u guys rly fucked up this torrent with no seeding. already up since last night and there is like 30 seeds to 2000 leechers
[V],Nepotu,2012-07-30T16:17Z,"Hey, necr00, watch out! It's only 1 seeder. Me. Until it complished 100% of file. After that the speed will increase substantially. I told you yet that I have only a 80 kB/s upload bandwith. Now it's 88% availability."
