Just copy this folders inside Pro_Shaders_maps and you should have all the materials ready (no missing material anymore, doesn't ask for crack).

If you need the maps you can extract them from Pro Shader Installer with 7zip.



have a nice day


p.s. if you already have "map pack 1" (the one I uploaded yesterday, with concrete, organic, metal and tile maps) you can download just the missing folders, uTorrent let you do that.
