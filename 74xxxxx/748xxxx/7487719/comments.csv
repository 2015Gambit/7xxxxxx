,almostD,2012-07-30T17:24Z,Is everything ok? Any errors? I will assume no comments means it's all right.
,Doomava,2012-07-30T21:25Z,"also noticed that some textures are not in the pack, example materials that have been showcased in tutorial videos, no complaining but will these be coming as well?"
,almostD,2012-07-30T23:33Z,"I didn't notice. You mean in the tutorials Andrew made? I will have a look but I'm not the source... I just share what I find and what I do.

I will also try to know how many materials are there in the official package.

,Doomava,2012-07-31T01:27Z,"Yeah the tutorial Andrew made, he shows over 30 materials for metals, one of which is black metal (or something).
But yeah these are working really well, thank you very much. "

,MuNaZA,2012-08-10T20:47Z,"Hi almostD, thanku for all this amazing torrents. I have one question, i think am going to buy the plugin, so all the packs you have uploaded, the official exe ones, will work with no problem if i have the official plugin installed? or those packs need a licence for each theirselfs? (sorry for my english). Thank you!"
,epicshit,2012-08-28T04:55Z,"man, this is almost perfect, except i'm still getting the ""pro shaders is not registered"". 

this is what i'm doing: install pro shaders, then copy folders (that contain all the emf files) into ""pro shader maps"" folder. 

am i missing something? here's a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/JWYbE.jpg"
