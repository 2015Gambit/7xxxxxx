He will never finish his torrents, even if you see a few seeders.
Try to check his uploads - they all show a few seeders and more than 100
leechers, which is not normal.
He just want you to check his screenshot, so he can get some $ "
,jonne.zoide,2012-07-29T01:02Z,"So true what you write tch321. I'm yet to finish a single download from him, and I've been trying for quite a while."
,WangLeeHk,2012-07-29T18:59Z,"Agreed, this guy is a time and bandwidth waster! Avoid and - as mentioned earlier - do NOT click his links!"
