Notes: Video contains quite a bit of movement that can cause the
AR to change around a bit every now and again. We did a resize of the video to
try and get it looking as nice as possible in all places. Video has a slight
flicker. Other standard filters were used and tweaked to get the video looking
sexy as well. Audio was just muxed and synced. Enjoy.

Thanks to that special somebody... ;)
