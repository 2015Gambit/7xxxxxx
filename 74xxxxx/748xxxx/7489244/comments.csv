,.CyberPunk.,2012-08-05T09:48Z,"NOTICE TO UPLOADERS!

Why is it that you guys are not posting the original source anymore on a lot of movies? This one says HDCAM by BOOST. I get that, maybe he is the one who provided the source, or maybe he got this video from 26k or Hope?? It would be nice to know who's video it is so we can tell if it is any different from the other current torrents!

In my understanding, it works like this. You uploaders have access to (what we called on IRC warez channels) ""distro"" access. The movies can be in the distro area well before they are actually publicly released to the warez scene. Then you guys, the uploaders, ""release"" the movie to the public. Maybe you guys actually have access to a distro area on IRC. Your hookup :) Then you, as uploaders, upload the release to various torrent sites, such as TPB. However, many of times, the ""group"" name has been changed from the original source provider. Leave the original sources, and add your tag. You are the releaser, you get credit too! You packaged it up, and released it to the public, or ran the vid through filters yourself to make it even better.. So you still do work, and can TAG your name on the upload title. However, in the info, it should still be giving credit to the original provider, the source! 90% of the time, the real source provider's credit is removed, and all the torrents are the same!

You can have 5 different copies, all uploaded the same day here on TPB, but really they are all from the same source, just the uploader stripped credits from the provider and added their own name/tag/group. Bull!

I would like to know the original ""video source"" and ""audio source"" to be able to distinguish between the 100s of uploads of the same damned movie! Most of them are all the exact same! This is bull, and TPB should delete these torrents and strip skulls from people doing this!

If you have 10 different torrents to pick from, by different people (say heist, bone, froggie, scene4all, scenebalance, ect) but they are all the same original source, you are splitting up the seeders across 10 different pots!

Regardless, knowing the source of the video can make our decision (as the downloader) much easier! I have seen some movies I have downloaded actually tell the real source of the video, and it should, imo, be a standard for the scene!

LOOK ==> When rating videos guys, don't give a damn good TS quality torrent a 5 video rating, just because it isn't perfect BluRay quality!

If it is THE BEST CAM YOU HAVE SEEN, then give it a ""V: 10"". If it is am amazing TS, give it a ""V: 10"", if it is an amazing DVDRip, give it a ""V: 10""!!!

For instance, this is a TS. WE ALL KNOW it is a freaking TS! If it doesn't get any better as a TS quality, give it a freaking 10! Of flipping course we know it isn't a bluray quality TS just because it says 10! It just means, this is the best quality in the realm of TS copies!

If we had unity, as a scene, it would make things a lot better. However you have random retards coming along saying ""I give it a V:5 A:6"".. COMPARED TO WHAT DUDE! other TS copies you have seen? When only comparing TS video quality, a 5 isnt good! If you are comparing it 1 being shit, and 10 being bluray quality, then a 5 for a TS would be pretty good... So to many, the comments of quality ratings, is completely worthless.

I have been in the scene, back when IRC was really popular. I actually was an uploader for a pretty popular IRC warez channel and had distro access! This was like 10 years ago, lol."

,relaxin,2012-08-11T04:19Z,Could someone confirm if this has the Simpsons short 'The Longest Daycare' or not? Thank you.
,relaxin,2012-08-11T04:50Z,"This does NOT have the Simpsons short 'The Longest Daycare' included. I'm answering my own question, in case anyone else comes looking for it."
,ironymon,2012-08-14T16:55Z,"yet he misses the point, uploaders set up their own seedboxes, or from own computer and own pocket, if one has limited bandwidth, they give shit for free, n u whine about everything."
,KenMarius,2012-09-03T01:10Z,"ironymon: You are correct. But it's like something being produced, right? Paramount, Universal, Marvel, Disney etc are the production studios, however the director is the one making the movie look good. But both get credits. I completely agree with CyberPunk"
,SuperSrt4,2012-09-11T20:38Z,Thank you for the movie.  My daughter will love this.
