,shauwy,2012-07-30T13:37Z,Thanks but no probleme with FLT ;)
,The4X3R,2012-07-30T13:41Z,I didn't have any problems with FLT release
,tope47,2012-07-30T13:51Z,will it run with pre-load?
,Jfudge17,2012-07-30T14:05Z,Does anyone know where the save games are located from the FLT releases? i always like to back up my saves when recracking a game with a different crack. any info would be nice thanks. ps. i have checked all the normal locations and cant seem to find it in appdata or my docs etc
,Hancock79,2012-07-30T14:13Z,"i didn't have any problems either but if there's a potential for problems because of a bad crack i'd fix them and upload a new one too.

always some showing off some silly condescending message between release groups.  who cares, upload our free stuff, we're all theives give it a rest with the integrity bullshit"
,Hancock79,2012-07-30T14:15Z,your saves should be at \My DocumentsActivisionPrototype 2.  that's where I just found mine

,InfinityMU,2012-07-30T15:15Z,"the game still crashing for me after few mins of gameplay,is it because i use the cracked prototype2.exe of FLT?
i need the original exc?"
,divesh8_4,2012-07-30T15:51Z,my flt crack didnt have a exe file it only had prototype2engine.dll and steam_api.dll
,InfinityMU,2012-07-30T16:35Z,"@divesh8_4

the update_common.zip contains prototype2.exe"
,tope47,2012-07-30T16:57Z,can anyone tell will it work with preload plzz!
,yudimultiply,2012-07-30T17:18Z,Can I apply this crack to FLT released version. Is that compatible????
,OmniNegro,2012-07-30T18:43Z,"I do not know why I bother to type this, since you did not read the information already provided. Yes. This will work with the FLT release. It is actually designed for that.

And on another note, it is sad to see Skidrow dissing FLT for their crack method. But at least they were relatively kind about it. FLT may have rushed to be first. And they may have missed a few things. 

But the scene is about helping people avoid paying an unfair price for inferior products. So please keep things civil and be respectful.

As always, once you see that you like the game, make the arrangements you need to in order to purchase it. If no-one buys the games, they have no motivation to make more."
,InfinityMU,2012-08-01T08:21Z,"i reinstalled the game also deleted the save game files,but still i experience same issues as in FLT crack,low framerate and game crashing after few minutes of gameplay"
