Episode 9 : The Film School Generation

In the 1960s and 1970s, a group of young mavericks-Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and others-tried to revolutionize the way American films were made and appreciated. This program explores the financial and cultural forces that made their success possible; the influence of classical Hollywood genres and new technology on their work; and their continuing evolution as idiosyncratic filmmakers with commercial clout.
