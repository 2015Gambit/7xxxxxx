What If A Ghost Joins You On Your Daily Life??


This is one of the best movies that malayalam film industry has produced considering the facts like a perfect blend of storyline, entertainment, comedy and emotions. Like already mentioned in the plot section, the movie revolves around the story of Balakrishnan (Mukesh) who undergoes a heart transplantation surgery which becomes a great success but resulting in him being followed by the ghost of aby mathew (Jayaram) whose heart was transplanted on to Balakrishnan.

The movie actually emphasises a myth that when a person dies in an unnatural way like murder; his ghost or internal energy does not die with it or leave to another world. The ghost, thus lives among us unnoticed and unknown(as the ghost could never see, feel or speak to humans) till a particular time or action has taken place which will decide whether the ghost must leave for heaven or hell. But in this movie, since the heart of aby mathew, who has now turned to be a ghost, has been transplanted to Balakrishnan; there arise a case that Balakrishnan exclusively can see, speak and touch the ghost.

The movie then shows as to how Balakrishnan discovers more about aby, his family, his death (which is in fact a murder), the killer, the mastermind etc..

I must really say that the cast for the movie was so well chosen that it really lights up the movie. Jayaram, Mukesh, Sreenivasan and Sai kumar have shown a commendable performance.

Its a mustDon't skip this one..
