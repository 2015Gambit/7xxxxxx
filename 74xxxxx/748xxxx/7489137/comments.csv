,topk,2012-07-31T01:25Z,Is this legit? I'd prefer SKIDROW over anyone else but why none of guys like extremezone have this SKIDROW release (i never heard of a chris-askel)?
,riplikethat,2012-07-31T03:18Z,"topk is Extremezone's little bitch. He loves sucking their dick so much he is ignoring the cocks of every other uploader.

We don't suck their cocks but topk.. oh yeah."
,naff99,2012-07-31T06:51Z,lmao! .1 kb/s 
,Hancock79,2012-07-31T09:19Z,extremezone already uploaded FLT and the proper crack works with it supposedly.  seems reason enough to not bother unless you do it before anyone else.  way too many dupe releases lately just spreading peers all over the place
,grimfangs,2012-07-31T13:54Z,"@SKIDROW I just wanted to know how much time would it take you to upload an Assassin's Creed III torrent. It's worth 50 Euros. That's about $80.
Of course it'll be after October 31 2012. But, how much time after that?
And it's price isn't coming down. Even AC Revelations is still worth 50 Euros."
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-07-31T17:02Z,"@topk
Then wait for exstremezone upload , but the releases will be still same , only thing what is different is the ppl who upload these releases.
If it wasn't legit , then it would not be here.
The FLT release didn't have a crack , skidrow released this game and but the crack with it ""DVD2/sr-p2crack.rar	5.26 MiB"" so they who already have FLT release can download only crack."
,guiduzinho,2012-08-01T18:37Z,does anybody know if this comes with the excessive force dlc?
,Dycon,2012-08-03T07:49Z,"I had the FLT but it didn't work for me even with the SKIDROW... First time it crashed giving me the Blue Screen, then, after I put the SKIDROW pack, it was just crashing... so let see how this work..."
,AnarchyDoom,2012-08-03T09:45Z,SKYDROW can you tell me how do i make the radnet work?
,Plan9x128,2012-08-03T18:44Z,Guys seed.
,XHaloXX,2012-08-04T12:54Z,"Sad news to everyone, radical entertainment has been shutdown by Fucktivision (Activision) the parent company, This fucktivision crap is shutting down every single company they bought and cancelling good titles.

So this is the end of the line, no more protoype, its the final game in the series UNLESS some other company bought the copyrights of this game and released it.

damn i was planning to buy this one to support Radical but the shutdown decision was made before even releasing the PC version. so there is no point to buy this game as you are supporting Fucktivision. 

DONT BUY THIS GAME, BOYCOTT FUCKTIVISION."

During: http://guides.gamepressure.com/prototype2/guide.asp?ID=15002
mission when it gets to objective ""New objective: Attack the Blackwatch trooper"" I perform the objective but it doesn't register as complete, i kill; the rest of the guys, and then i am just stuck without being able to advance the plot in any way."

Turns out the game itself is broken not the crack. And there wont be a patch since activision fired the entire dev team."

,MrTTAO,2012-08-22T23:25Z,"@Auth0rity: I found the solution in the steam forum,  you need to use affinity lock to limit the game to only 1 CPU core on that mission so they say.
Of course, with only 1 core it lags. So after passing this mission I set it to 2 cores only and played the whole game with only 2 cores without further issue."
,lildogman,2012-08-27T04:37Z,im prob just a noob at this but i cant figure out the crack file when i open it all that happens is steam opens up with the trailer for the game
