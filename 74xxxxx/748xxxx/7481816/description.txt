Thanks to my buddy Steve for loaning me this boxed set.  We share a love for music, both recorded and live.  Thanks again!

I have to admit.  I contacted Nancy Wilson and proposed that I not share this torrent.  All she had to do to prevent me from sharing was to have wild sex with me for 5 or six times.  Needless to sayΓÇªI AM sharing this.

Epic Records and Legacy Recordings proudly announce the release of Strange Euphoria, the first definitive career-spanning, multi-label boxed set retrospective chronicling the seminal American rock band Heart, personally curated by Ann Wilson and Nancy Wilson.

A carefully-considered anthology of biggest hits and best-loved songs set alongside deep catalog treasures, rarities, demos and live performances. Strange Euphoria consists of three compact discs, and a bonus CD of five Led Zeppelin cover tracks in a deluxe box.  The video included has long been available as a torrent so I've saved the bandwidth by not sharing it.
