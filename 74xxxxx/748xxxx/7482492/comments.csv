rename to the video file name with `.srt` file ending. Works great!

I mean... it's fun to watch, good action etc. but it's ridiculously stupid.

,vacuoso,2012-08-13T04:43Z,"fbinot, you are a bona fide moron. you accused an uploader of being illiterate on a different torrent because it wasn't immediately evident to your dumb ass that the ""dubbed"" referred to english... and here you are, refusing to read 10 lines of subtitled dialogue... maybe you should learn to read, and many of your problems will be solved!"
