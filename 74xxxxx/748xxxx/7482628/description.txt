Approaching Nirvana's Latest album, Evolve (Pre-released Songs)

Please note this only contains their first two songs but I decided to share it out anyway. The full album will be coming out on September the 1st and I will do my best to seed it out to you guys, just as I've done with their discography so far (I will update this as well!!)

Also don't forget to be generous and seed, you're not the only one who wants this!

If you would rather you can download the same files, but hosted on MediaFire by using the following link:


Also download their whole discography:

Thank you very much everyone!
