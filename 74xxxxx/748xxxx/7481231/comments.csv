No, it's not, that's politics at best and gossip at worst. Who's judging?? Montford? Industry-funded 'Blog scientists'? Politics and gossip is all that your sources have, I'm afraid (e.g. Montford's book is pure gossip and illogical reasoning). Even 'skeptical' scientists (and that is a travesty of the word skeptical) do not deny AGW, though of course in public meetings of the faithful they imply otherwise. Implication though is not scientific, it's only 'evidence'  for those who want to - or must  - believe. 

When pressed, no climate scientist can deny the scientific process and irrefutable evidence involved in climate change. 

The killer fact here though is that 'skeptics' who talk of evidence and logic so obviously, painfully don't understand the words they use, because they pick up any argument or 'evidence' unquestioningly and ALWAYS end up contradicting themselves by using arguments which cannot logically be used together. They have no internally consistent logic, because they're thinking politically - 'anything goes', 'throw enough mud', etc. When someone inevitably shows up such basic errors of logic, and they deny even that, is it any wonder they're called denialists?? 

This selective skepticism and belief in a ludicrous worldwide scientific conspiracy of thousands of independent scientists is truly an insult to the intelligence...

,AlexLibman,2012-08-15T20:47Z,"Stossel is definitely the best current events program on television, and the only one I watch on regular basis (in addition to my mandatory dose of dispatches from the left-wing bubble like Commie-dy Central, to see what they're up to).  In an interview with the ""Free Talk Live"" radio show, John Stossel acknowledged the possibility that people can share his show freely on the Internet and didn't have a particular problem with it.  Big thanks to everyone who uploads and seeds his shows!

RTT2 climate confusion is debunked in depth elsewhere."
,RTT2,2012-08-16T10:40Z,"Sorry, but the uploader's comments about AGW are here, and I have to challenge the misconceptions wherever they are, because they are being actively spread, despite being demonstrably false 'zombie arguments', and the whole ridiculous anti-AGW movement is a real low point for the Right also.

I'm sorry to say, but the evidence for self-contradictory, political reasoning is here too. See the casual conflation of 'Global Warming' and 'Cooling' from a so-called rationalist! The reasoning goes thus: 'There is insufficient evidence for AGW, models are unreliable, so what can you say, warmists? Ha! Now, Global Cooling, on the other hand...' and there follows the embarrassing spectacle of sceptical amnesia, as the 'rationalist' now keenly accepts far less evidence for the opposite phenomenon (and now trusts the models too!)!

This is political thinking. A true rationalist would not feel the need to go to the opposite extreme (i.e 'cooling'), but politicians and politically-minded amateur debaters do, because the law of rhetoric says it sounds stronger. The contrarian mind at it's most petty.

That's all I can say. I hope you see sense. I doubt watching Stossel will help. Try 'The Day Today' or 'Brass Eye'..."
[T],skJGZV6z,2012-08-17T07:25Z,"We're all askew on account of the Olympics, but soon I'm sure it'll be back on track. For the week of 20120816, The Stossel show aired a rebroadcast of an early program in the show's run from 2010, ""Politician's Top 10 Promises Gone Wrong."" Available here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6050538/Politicians_Top_10_Promises_Gone_Wrong

No seeds (it's on page 13 or so of my list, and not surfaced by search keyword ""Stossel"" despite my tags, so understandable; I shall attempt to re-seed).

RTT2: Thank you for the kind advice. I did indeed check out ""Brass Eye"" and found the program ""Paedophiles"" quite to my liking, as well with the whole series. For examples of the the kind of science process I am worried some within your camp may be engaged in, may I in return refer you to season 1 of another fine series: ""Look Around You."" Do take care, as I trust by your comment, you may have run out your supply of anti-Garry gum!"
,RTT2,2012-08-17T11:11Z,"Ok I found some more gum. The point you've missed is context. Yeah I liked Look Around You, but I don't think it was meant as a critique of science generally, more an extrapolation of 'Open University' TV education of the '70's, with corresponding attitudes. Bit too keen on ghosts for a rationalist like me though ;) 

Brass Eye is a media satire, and co-writer (Iannucci) of it's predecessor, The Day Today, said recently that people thought it was 
ridiculously extreme at the time, (early '90s) but that the news networks have caught up,and people have just accepted it - and that's where Fox News in particular comes in. The other thing Brass Eye pointed up was the vanity and credulity of various public figures, and I only wish they could have got sceptic darling 'Lord' Monckton for the 'Science' episode, because he would have fitted in perfectly with his 'I've invented a machine that cures AIDS!'

It's quite a presumption to talk about 'my camp' solely with generalizations about all science, from an absurdist spoof. Are you backtracking on your rationalism? All I've done is try to get you to accept a perfectly valid theory with overwhelming evidence and stop talking embarrassing nonsense (sorry, but it is) and embodying Arthur C Clarke's definition of 'Pig-headed scepticism' to try to refute it, and now I have a 'camp'! 

I haven't said what should be done about it, in truth I don't know. I advocate making distinctions rather than generalizations, though, and I know and respect people who've accepted AGW (or perhaps, as with all the other uncontested theories, don't feel the need to get out of their depth in opposing it), but believe nothing can be done about it. That's a perfectly defensible position I wish more 'sceptics' would take. At least it doesn't look like bloody Socratic irony or a spoof like those above...

Right I've finished the gum, so that's the end of this suspiciously long and detailed comment, which of course must set alarm bells ringing in any message-board rationalist, who naturally would be concerned with the level of internet debate ...;)"
,aftac,2012-08-19T17:38Z,"Is the 20120809 show also a rerun? And any idea when a new show will be available? Stossel is my favorite show, along with Rush. Thanks greatly for making them available as they keep hope alive."
,EdgarS789,2012-09-03T09:50Z,Last Thursday's show is not a rerun. Hope you can upload it soon!
[T],skJGZV6z,2012-09-11T08:01Z,"20120906 - I missed this due to timeslot issues surrounding the convention. I've been deliberately tuning out the conventions...all just so much tripe IMO. So sorry about that. (And anyway, t'was apparently armchair analysis of O's speech, which didn't seem particularly interesting, even if it was going to be picked apart by interesting pundits.) Perhaps this week, we'll be back on an even keel with 20120913.

We all gotta stop placing so much importance on the office of the president. Leader of the country? We ought to think of this officeholder as merely leader of the government. Cat-wrangler'n'chief. We'll lead ourselves, thanks."
