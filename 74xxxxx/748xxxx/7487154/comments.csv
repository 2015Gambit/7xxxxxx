,yoncenator,2012-07-30T07:33Z,Why do you guys fall for this crap? Boycott passwords
,somedude72,2012-07-30T07:33Z,"Moderators, please delete the fake comments claiming this is fake. There is no rar or anything like that. These comments are obviously sock puppet accounts of the people who *do* post the rar scam-spam trying to discredit ettv, who is solid.

This download is an mp4 file not any kind of archive. Ignore the fake spam comments."
,Uhlaf,2012-07-30T07:34Z,"The file is a mp4 container, it's not even zipped...how is this possibly password protected. 

Why would the fine folks at ettv even try to pull a bait and switch and ruin the reputation they have?"
,LordGod88,2012-07-30T07:36Z,"This isn't fake.  I downloaded and just finished watching.  Where it says 'files' click on the number 2 and you can see it's an mp4, not a zip or rar."
,minipl,2012-07-30T07:38Z,It's very easy to tell if something is fake.  Look at the file names.  It's mp4 which isn't a zip so no password protection.  I love idiots when they cry fake but don't pay attention.
,keote,2012-07-30T07:47Z,"This is good ignore the fake comments, it's not even in  rar/zip format...it's an mp4 dumbasses have nothing better to do than waste there time trying to discredit someone who uses their time to do something productive."
,acsmith1972,2012-07-30T07:55Z,So ettv is into scamming now? Fuckers. 
,Granchy,2012-07-30T08:27Z,"omfg, I hate the faggots who claim something is fake when it isn't.

This is seriously just an mp4, I've watched the beginning and it looks quite legit.  Assholes."

This upload is Indeed a legit copy. "
,Jammin Man,2012-07-30T11:11Z,"@OgFux69
I know what you are saying. I have seen this myself with reputable uploaders; It starts out as a dodgy passworded RAR and then when you go back to check it is no longer a RAR.
It should be obvious with so many different people posting about the problem that something dodgy is going on."
,Spudgun17,2012-07-30T11:33Z,"Perfect quality as always, thanks ettv, you're a star!  "

,obvious2me,2012-07-30T13:47Z,"Been downloading all these recent trusted/vip torrents that are getting slammed with ""fake.""

I still haven't come across one that is actually a fake...

+1 ettv, legit torrent just like all the others coming from vip/trusted."
,annabananabee,2012-07-30T14:10Z,"So yes there was a rar file, it was the first one i downloaded, but it was not listed under [ettv] it was listed under [eztv] which is usually a reliable source as well, either way this file is fine and i dont have to swear or make funny pictures with my words to tell you so. Enjoy the show!"
,Steks25,2012-07-30T14:50Z,"Of course its legit, this is ettv.

V10 S10.  
Excellent video, small file size.
Perfect."
,Amosis,2012-07-30T15:53Z,"I downloaded this last night. It was a rar file and I needed a password. That's twice I've experienced this. I don't go to sites to get a password. 
Some people are saying there is no password others are saying there is. THAT IS ODD. Now all of a sudden I'm having trouble with my utorrent. It wants to check every file and it gets stuck checking. 
I've used torrents for 10 years. So I'm no newbie. 
All of you people swearing and name calling either because you swear it works or swear it does need to grow up. 
Bottom line I'm not getting my download almost 12 hours late."
,Srsbznz,2012-07-30T16:02Z,"Thanks for the upload, and of of course it's legit like other people have already pointed out.

How ever the sound quality isn't that what I've come to expect. It's not horrible but it's like 6.5/10 compared to the normal 9/10."

,Fonzroid,2012-07-30T17:01Z,"this is a good copy, the .rar file is marked [eztv] at the end of the file name. but now eztv has a real copy too. i dled the fake but didnt think to check the file or who uled it, oops i guess thats MY FALT not the uler. let spam pushers be dumb, let the rest of us be smarter."

Honestly, I don't care if it is ettv or etphonehome as long as it is not slow and it is good quality."
,piratiinho,2012-07-30T19:59Z,"Thank you ettv, always good quality.

Honestly, I don't care if it is ettv or etphonehome as long as it is a good torrent. 
And as far as I remember ettv never uploaded a rar file so the haters are ridiculous and pathetic."
,THEsemajNESS,2012-07-30T21:03Z,"Another PERFECT RELEASE. every episode of the new season that I've downloaded, has been an ETTV release.

And for the record, a faker is not someone who uses a similar name. Quit arguing internet semantics, get laid for once in a fucking while and FUCKING WATCH BREAKING BAD."

,cor.hor,2012-07-30T22:31Z,"Wait... all the original comments said that this was fake.  I downloaded it and it was fake.  Now people are claiming that it is real.  Can torrents change?  How could this happen?

I am 100% certain that this torrent was an encrypted rar file which had a txt file saying to go to some website to get the password, where you were given offers to complete before getting the password.

Why did ettv upload two copies of this episode anyway?  

Some is claiming it was a fake, but isn't anymore.  You can change torrents?  How does this work?  I'll see if ettv explains what happened somewhere.  But I am not lying, I got this torrent 3 minutes after it was uploaded and it was a fake, which enraged me as I trusted ettv for over a year, and to have them switch to fakes is a dick move."
,crazyoliv,2012-07-30T23:23Z,"Hey ho pink lady.
Don't you realize even a sec that few torrent may share the same name?

,psiche,2012-07-31T06:51Z,"THE CONFUSION EXPLAINED, PLEASE READ:

There was a torrent uploaded approximately fifteen minutes after the episode aired. It was by an ANONYMOUS uploader using the same title format as ettv and then tacking [ettv] at the end. It was a fake, a rar that required you to do some fishy things to get to the video. OBVIOUSLY it was a scam. That torrent, as far as I can tell, has since been removed. THIS TORRENT was uploaded around an HOUR and fifteen minutes after the episode aired, and has the real, working mp4.

ettv is not at fault, it was the fault of an anonymous scammer who tried to trick the tpb community. It didn't work. However, people are EXTREMELY STUPID and still pin this on ettv.

Thank you, and stop calling this fake. I have it downloaded and have watched it, it is completely legitimate."
