,Chris2027,2012-07-30T11:29Z,Why the DTS track... I've read it has problems... is the stereo track included? *fingers crossed*
,nomad1980,2012-07-30T23:21Z,"If you insist on the highest quality audio, you might want to wait. CBS is replacing three of the discs in the set due to surround sound issue."
[H],politux,2012-07-30T23:28Z,Good torrent!
,piratebuddha,2012-07-31T00:51Z,"Thank you so much for this! 
I've been hoping it would pop up, however, CBS acknowledged today that there is an issue with the audio on some of the blu-ray discs (more info here: http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/30/star-trek-tng-season-one-disc-replacement-program) which does not necessarily mean that this copy is corrupted, but I just wanted to give everyone a heads up.
Regardless, thank you BOZX for sharing, you never dissapoint!"
,xxGBHxx,2012-07-31T01:10Z,Are the bonus features here as well?
,Chris2027,2012-07-31T07:22Z,"@xxGBHxx - No, no bonus features, unfortunately... :/"

,metropolis80,2012-07-31T15:00Z,1080p soon?
,torrential1,2012-07-31T20:25Z,"It's already 1080p. Most groups already have this, but I'm going to hold off because the pictures are to big for the size (should be only 1 gigabyte, not 2)."
,Chris2027,2012-08-01T01:19Z,"@torrential1 - However, this rip is 720p... as for the size... it's actually smaller than the episodes ripped from the sampler pack... the Encounter at Farpoint episode someone ripped from the sampler in 1080p taking quality over size, was 4.96GB... which is quite good considering it's basically a feature film in length... as for the other 2 episodes about 45 minutes each, they were 1.96GB so just about 2GB in size... so they're not much smaller than this rip... though I do think given that the other person was able to rip them smaller and still maintain 1080p without smudge accumulation and quality issues... I need to ask him if he got S1 on BR..."
,Chris2027,2012-08-01T01:21Z,"Correction*

@torrential1 - This rip is 720p... as for the size... I agree, the Encounter at Farpoint episode someone ripped from the sampler in 1080p taking quality over size, was 4.96GB... which is quite good considering it's basically a feature film in length... as for the other 2 episodes about 45 minutes each, they were 1.96GB so just about 2GB in size... so they're not much smaller than this rip... though I do think given that the other person was able to rip them smaller and still maintain 1080p without smudge accumulation and quality issues... I need to ask him if he got S1 on BR..."
,Featherawr,2012-08-01T06:22Z,"Yeah..  This looks like crap compared to the 1080p rip nelwyn uploaded if you compare them.  The whole point of this is that it looks good, someone needs to upload in 1080p, or at least 900p like the TOS episodes.

It's good and all that this was uploaded in the first place, but it's not quite there yet IMO."
,Brat001,2012-08-02T02:55Z,2.2. gigs an episode at only 720??? did you even bother to compress them? we can get a hour and a half long bluray movie into a smaller file with decent quality. btw they recalled a lot of the discs to this release due to surround sound quality today.
,Featherawr,2012-08-02T03:41Z,"2.2GB 720p: http://i983.photobucket.com/albums/ae313/Featherawr/BOZX720p.jpg
2.4GB 1080p: http://i983.photobucket.com/albums/ae313/Featherawr/nelwyn1080p.jpg

if anyone is interested ;)"
,snakuplisskin,2012-08-02T08:46Z,"Can't figure out the audio on this.  So far I've only got the first ep fully downloaded so I don't know if it affects all episodes or just the first.  When I try to watch it in media player or media player classic, I get no sound at all, and when I try to watch it on my ps3 via ps3mediaserver, I get noise like TV static."
,Featherawr,2012-08-02T09:14Z,"snakuplisskin, try and download VLC and try watching on that or download the CCCP which should get Media Player Classic working.

VLC and MPC works for me, can't get it working on Android though."
,snakuplisskin,2012-08-02T10:31Z,"Not sure how my cccp install got screwed up, but after uninstalling it and reinstalling, I can hear the audio on my pc.  Still no luck on my ps3, though, even after tweaking the transcode settings to force it to transcode dts audio.  Guess I'm stuck with watching it on the computer."
,NYTropix22,2012-08-04T23:18Z,"How come when I add this to my downloading queue, I cannot choose which episodes to add? I don't want them all..."
,Featherawr,2012-08-05T15:38Z,"@NYTropix22
You gotta wait a minute for it to download the file list, ever since TPB switched over to magnet links it has to do this."
,abnormalreply,2012-08-06T00:21Z,"Guys, seeeeed. I'm stuck at 7% and I'm only downloading the first episode :["
,danwat1234,2012-08-07T05:30Z,"I would like ~4GB per episode for maximum quality.. unless you can make it lossless from the bluray at a lower bitrate. Make the files as big as needed to preserve all the perceived quality of the bluray..

Thanks uploader, 2GB might be fine."

,topk,2012-08-13T06:33Z,I hate DTS! I watch my downloads on TV via media player and it cannot deal with DTS
,atavist,2012-08-18T08:37Z,"I've been working on a more reasonably compressed version this. I've gone from the original 2.35GB to about 900MB per episode. 

I'm still in the process of downloading and compressing but I should be done soon. Let me know what you think of the screen caps. There is some quality loss and more noise but I think most people won't notice/mind. IMO, if you're going to do a 720p torrent of something like this file size should be a consideration.

Let me know what you think. Keep in mind these screencaptures are JPGs so not 100% true to the video.

,joe180,2012-08-19T12:10Z,How does the quality compare to the 1080p rips (which are half the bit rate)
,Featherawr,2012-08-22T09:25Z,Even though this is only 720p it's MUCH better than the 1080p one afkguy uploaded.
,Featherawr,2012-09-03T21:35Z,"It's POSSIBLE this contains malware:

Star.Trek.TNG.S01.Season.1.UNRATED.720p.BluRay.exe ~NCIS:Downloader-XS

Now this is an EXE that was apparently created in the directory uTorrent downloads to so this looks a little fishy.  The file was also modified while I wasn't even at the computer.  I also had a bunch of other similar gay stuff in the C:$Recycle.BinS-1-5-18 with similar modified dates.

I'll try to stay open and trust that BOZX wouldn't upload something malicious but I thought I would at least post this."
,.KRAAG.,2012-09-18T11:41Z,Why have you described this as Unrated? I'm just curious if there was some star trek poontang i may have missed out on? maybe Riker and Troi finally get it on? :P
