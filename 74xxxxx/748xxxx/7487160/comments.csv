why do you have to bitch so much? he's doing this for free. YOU need to give up with the bitchin' at volunteers providing you access to cable tv shows FOR FREE."
,Osceana,2012-07-30T06:18Z,"thanks for the comment dasracht, rather not waste my time"
,seshwan84,2012-07-30T06:25Z,"lol, it came like 8 minutes after the first 720p one. Settle down dasracht."
,r0ssxx,2012-07-30T07:40Z,LOL dasracht being a noob you have no idea what a noob you sound like when you complain about RAR's . RAR files aren't something sceneline does to annoy you RAR's are a warez scene standard and have been since the 90's. I prefer to download RARS personally because if I download a damaged part I only have to recover or re-download 1 RAR rather than the entire show. Dibya uploads the way he does for Noob friendlyness so guys like you dont complain.

,PrincePwn,2012-07-30T12:57Z,WTF I left it overnight it's still 0%? Never had this with a torrent before.

jeez, shut the fuck up already. are you dibya or some nerdy diehard fan of his? doesn't matter, the fact that you're taking FREE content seriously already tells us how much of a social outcast you are.

there's no such thing as ""better quality"" if both torrents came from the SAME source and are the SAME file.

if you don't like this release, ignore it. or is it too hard to do so without running your mouth off? go do something else better with your time instead of whining like a little girl on here."
,dingo8babby,2012-07-31T09:37Z,"""go do something else better with your time instead of whining like a little girl on here. ""

Oh, the irony!"
,PauloFran,2012-08-01T02:07Z,"Very nice video quality.
Thank you!"
