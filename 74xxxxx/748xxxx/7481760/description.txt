ΓÇ£Where there are no men, be thou a man.ΓÇ¥
ΓÇö RABBI HILLEL

ΓÇ£Let them call me rebel and welcome, I feel no concern
from it; but I should suffer the misery of devils,
were I to make a whore of my soul..

acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all
our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to

or which is which), the first radical known to man
who rebelled against the establishment and did it
so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom
