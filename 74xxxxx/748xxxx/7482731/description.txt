Your Uninstaller! Pro v7.4.2012.05
 
Overview 

You've probably encountered some stubborn programs that just won't uninstall at all or uninstall completely, right? And, more often than not, when you use the Windows Add/Remove Program utility, there are remnants or "artifacts" of the program left behind in the system registry and on your hard drive that are no longer needed. These useless items will bog your PC down and, over time, it will get slower and slower lugging around this useless baggage - unexpected errors and frequent crashes may also occur because of this! 

What's the problem?

 Let's say you frequently install trial versions of programs to check them out. And let's also say that, after giving them a shot, you don't like them and decide to uninstall them. Unfortunately, you find it impossible to uninstall some of them - they remain on the Windows installed programs list even they are "supposedly" gone. These improperly uninstalled programs can also be the cause of errors because many junk files and registry keys/values were left behind on your PC. These 'junk artifacts' can - and do - cause system problems and slow down Windows substantially.
 
Here's the solution!
 
Your Uninstaller! will solve these problems. It removes any installed program and clears all the left-behind traces - no more 'junk artifacts' remaining. Whenever you uninstall a program, Your Uninstaller! removes it completely! There's absolutely nothing left behind.

 "PCs inevitably accrue a mass of unwanted and unused files that eat up system resources and reduce system stability. Uninstalling these items can be an arduous task, but Your Uninstaller Pro simplifies the process considerably..." - CNET Review
