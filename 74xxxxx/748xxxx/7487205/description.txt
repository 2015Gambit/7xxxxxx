DESCRIPTION:

Communication is the absolutely indispensable leadership discipline. But too often leaders and professional communicators get mired in tactics and fail to influence public attitudes in the ways that would help them most. The Power of Communication is the solution. World-renowned leadership communication expert Helio Fred Garcia builds on the U.S. Marine CorpsΓÇÖ legendary publication Warfighting, showing how to apply the CorpsΓÇÖ proven leadership and strategy doctrine in all forms of public communicationΓÇôand achieve truly extraordinary results.

Garcia demonstrates how to orient on audiences, recognize their most critical concerns, and successfully communicate on three levels: strategic, operational, and tactical. YouΓÇÖll learn how to take the initiative and control the agendaΓÇªrespond to events with speed and focusΓÇªuse the power of maneuverΓÇªprepare and planΓÇªand put it all together, becoming a ΓÇ£habitually strategicΓÇ¥ communicator.

Communication has power, but, as with any powerful tool, it needs to be used effectively or it can cause significant self-inflicted harm. YouΓÇÖll learn specific, indispensable lessons of leaders communicating effectively, including AppleΓÇÖs Steve Jobs and the McDonaldΓÇÖs board, as well as from catastrophic mistakes of business and political leaders who got it wrong, from BPΓÇÖs Tony Hayward to the HP board to FEMA.
