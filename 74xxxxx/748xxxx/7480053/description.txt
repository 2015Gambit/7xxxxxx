Rian Miller joined the band in 1997 to contribute female vocals. In 2004, Rian was replaced by another female vocalist, Wendy Yanko. In 2005, Flesh Field performed at the M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany. Their 2004 album Strain peaked at number 4 on the 2005 DAC, charting for 8 weeks.
In January 2011, Ian Ross pronounced the retirement of Flesh Field as a musical project. Ian went on to further say that he will continue to make music, and that he is considering a new project. Seven of the instrumentals for "Tyranny of the Majority" were released on the official Flesh Field website mastered along with two additional untitled instrumentals that were cut from the album. Two of the album's tracks, "Swarm" and "Forgotten Trauma" can be found on the albums, "Dependence: Next Level Electronics: Volume 2" and "Septic VI" respectively.
