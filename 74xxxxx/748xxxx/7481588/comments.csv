Why can't descriptions be clear??"
,SCSA420,2012-07-28T11:56Z,FOR YOUR INFORMATION THIS IS NOT SPAM IT IS SIMPLY INFO FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT IT IN HD!!! So If you want the show in 720p do a search for London 2012 Olympics or London Olympics Opening Ceremony 2012 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH
,tentacle16,2012-07-28T11:58Z,"This is the whole show as broadcast on BBC One, including the entry of the athletes and the lighting of the cauldron. There are a few seconds missing (Maximum of 20 seconds) at two points during the entry of the athletes where I had to pause recording to break the file up.

Please stay with it, upload is only 1mb/s but I'll keep seeding.

Sorry I haven't given more details, I didn't know what people would expect because I never normally upload video. I got pissed off when the IOC blocked a 3 second clip on Youtube and so I decided to share it all."

Yes this is the whole thing.Tested it to 90%.No virus very clean and great.Just keep with it and seed."
