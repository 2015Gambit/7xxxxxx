Beacon is Irish pop/rock group Two Door Cinema Club's sophomore album. It follows up the group's impressive 2010 debut album, Tourist History. Once again featuring the talents of singer/guitarist/programmer Alex Trimble, guitarist/singer Sam Halliday, and bassist/singer Kevin Baird, the album was produced by Jacknife Lee (U2, R.E.M., Snow Patrol) and features more of the band's '80s post-punk and new wave-influenced melodic dance rock. Set for release in the fall of 2012, Beacon features such cuts as "Sleep Alone" and "Handshake," which were debuted live at various festivals in 2011.
