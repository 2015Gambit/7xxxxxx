We visit a tiny 1920's bungalow in Venice Beach California that's been renovated into the latest in modern design and green features. Then to a home nestled in the hills of Greece just outside Athens that combines contemporary design with natural and eco-friendly features that are as old as the hills. And then in Houston, we visit a colourful one-of-a-kind art deco inspired home that's cashing in on energy savings.
