,LaFouine2011,2012-07-31T18:28Z,"Hi,
The problem with that release is that the audio transcoding get messed up. Assuming the source is same as the 720p anoXmous ( REC.3.Genesis.2012.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-HDS [PublicHD]) is 23.976 fps, in 24fps it should be 1h20 not 1h33.
You can remux the 1080p video stream with the 720p audio stream in a 24fps container (mkv or mp4) to get a perfect one.

@Zen_Bud
Thanx. The 720p anoXmous release is not a cam (Cam scene release) but a cam (blair witch type movie) ;)
