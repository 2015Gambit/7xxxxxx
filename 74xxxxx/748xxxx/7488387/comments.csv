Please SEED."

I only have 31.0% after several weeks.

I would love to have this music.

You have several great torrents up which I have not seen on here before, if you put them up, I'll keep them going.
Thanks."

,Bert51,2012-09-02T01:21Z,"Sorry deemzeemz, but I now have 34% and uploaded nearly 5 gig.
You have some really good music and as I said I will seed it if I can get it.

Again Thanks Mate."
,Bert51,2012-09-08T02:11Z,"Sorry Mate, I'm go to give up and delete all your hard work.

If you need help ask, I have seeded your stuff 10 fold, but I have nothing finished.

Thanks for trying."

Seeding again. I was away."
