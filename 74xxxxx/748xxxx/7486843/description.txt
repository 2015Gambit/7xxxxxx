X-villain Mystique takes center stage in her own ongoing series. She is recruited by Professor Xavier for the more tricky espionage missions that the X-men just can't do. 
Mystique can be anything you want her to be- In a world of intrigue and seduction, where mutants are feared and hated and the are not enough to protect them, Mystique uses her shape-shifting abilities to further her own mutant rights agenda. And to get want she wants, she's not afraid to do whatever's necessary.
