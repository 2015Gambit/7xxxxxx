IMMERSE uses non avisynth method to ivtc.
All releases we watch from them are 
jerky and have bad ivtc. Until they fix
their known issues, you will see our
internals of all releases they do.

PS. ASAP uses faac.exe for audio encode,
we have tried to find a way to prove this
but cannot find data to expose the mp4.
If you can figure it out, we'd love to 
see others quality releases as proper.
