While The Beatles were hanging out getting ""spiritual"" in India, The Who were smashing their instruments on stage and The Rolling Stones were shooting heroin and writing music about Satan. ""Street Fighting Man"" and ""My Generation"" are 100x more rockin' than ""Paperback Writer"" or ""Revolution""."
,youwont,2012-07-28T19:35Z,"I'm a huge Beatles fan and I own every album and every iTunes release there has been. Beatlemaniacs will already have more than a few copies of each of these songs (anthology, past masters, album, etc.) but it's a great collection for the newbie Beatles fan or casual Beatles fan. It's something nice to have in my collection. "
,uncleowen55,2012-07-29T20:05Z,"The Who and the Stones were, are, great bands.  But, to say the Beatles are the most over-rated... blah, blah, blah is incredibly idiotic.  I could say too much about this.  One thing:  no Beatles, no British Invasion.  No British Invasion, no Stones and no Who.  It's all great music.
BTW, one of the stupidist things for anyone to say, IMHO, is ""the most (insert blank) in history!""   Totally asinine.  ""This was the lamest comment in all human history!"" :)"

I almost forgot, thanks for the torrent, Chris!"
,slimshd,2012-08-01T19:45Z,@BaronVonWatermelon- you cant say that beatles were over-rated...and also you cant compare with who or any other band..and if u dont like them then there is no need to come specially to comment and spread hate..just go listen to who and fuck yourself
[T],lopow,2012-08-03T16:25Z,"It is comforting to see that ""rating"" of a particular band is based on smashing instruments, shooting heroin and cocaine, vomiting and pissing themselves on stage, singing about Satan, etc ...   Based on these ""evaluation points""  I can't help but think that Pink Floyd was overrated too ... 

Thanks for straightening this out for us.  Otherwise we could have spent the rest of our lives totally misinformed.   "
[T],lopow,2012-08-03T16:27Z,"...and yes, thanks for the torrent.  wouldn't it be nice to have this one on actual vinyl?  "
,satandeal,2012-08-19T04:53Z,"Oh come one, over-rated, someone still don't get it, the stones always looked up the beatles to make their next step, nobody is compared to the beatles, the beatles are the reason why you're breathing, respect that."
