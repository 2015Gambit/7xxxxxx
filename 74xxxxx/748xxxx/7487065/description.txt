"86'd"

Pierce and Moretti race to find clues when a serial killer
from 1986 begins killing again. They catch a break when they 
learn that one of the victims is actually alive. Morettis dad, 
one of the investigators on the original case, offers his 
daughter advice. Pamela Reed also guest-stars as the mother 
of the surviving victim, while Armin Shimerman is the victims psychologist.
