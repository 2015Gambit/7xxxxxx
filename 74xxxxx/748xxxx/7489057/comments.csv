,righen,2012-07-31T06:03Z,"To the leechers:

An egoistic person who downloads a file using P2P technology, and who does NOT share (enough) with others when in possession of the complete file, reducing it's Availability. Normally in BitTorrent, it is polite and considerate to leave your connection open long after you finish downloading to seed - so that other peers in the swarm, who do NOT yet have the complete file yet, benefit from you sharing, as you did benefit from others sharing when you originally downloaded the torrent. Some share more, some share less, but a leech is somebody who closes their connection as soon as they have downloaded the complete file. In the long run, your total Share Ratio (Tools > Statistics > Transfers Tab) should always be >1.000! 

So please stop doing this man.......
