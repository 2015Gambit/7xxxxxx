"The musical ideas put forth on this record don't make sense if you try to make them make sense if that makes sense"

This record was made over the course of about 8 or so months, beginning in December 2011. I wrote and played all the music, wrote being used liberally as a great deal of the music was recorded without a clear structure or direction in mind. Rather I just took the advantage of having the opportunity to record some music at my home and this is what was the final stuff.

listen to it loud, at night, Trip Out to it.
