,ClipperCigars,2012-08-14T06:31Z,"Well, that it says ""Wii Hack Pack"" should be enough for most people to figure out without having their hand held. That plus the fact there is no game called Microwave Sam. Does EVERYTHING need to be explained to you?

Why isn't there any guide to go with it. It's called Google. If one is so devoid of sense that this is an issue, then just delete the hack pack because you'll never be able to follow the guide anyways and continue to demand your hand be held through every single step like all the other lazy and ignorant dipshits who think they are ""entitled"" to be able pirate games without having to make any effort on their own part for the privilege of that reward. You want something, it's your responsibility to get it and if you're too lazy or stupid to accomplish it, then you don't deserve it. 

Get a brain, get a clue, and quit bitching at the people who generously provide you the tools you need to do what you want. Ain't their fucking job to hold your hand and tie your shoes for you. "
