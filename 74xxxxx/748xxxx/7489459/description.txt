Plot: A major who actually witnessed the (in)famous UFO landing in Roswell in 1947, looks back on what really happened. He had a hard time trying to convince his superiors that he did not find just a weather balloon. Adapted from real-life events portrayed in the book 'UFO Crash at Roswell' by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt. With scenes from the original crash site and the well-known autopsy of the aliens.

Please note: This was originally a made-for-TV movie, and the brand-new DVD is not perfect. It sometimes has a few thin horizontal black lines that could not be removed in the ripping process.
