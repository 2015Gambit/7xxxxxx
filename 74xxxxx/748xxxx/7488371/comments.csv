,taistoi,2012-07-30T22:36Z,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
,jagwiz69,2012-07-31T02:36Z,"oh it has Maurizio Corigliano....must have a great plot with outstanding character development and great special effects like a bunch of windows breaking, which is impossible for that era. There's no way it's low budget with Maurizio Corigliajafojb in it."
[V],Nepotu,2012-07-31T02:41Z,In imdb says 2.2/10 from 352 users and user review says worst movie ever. I think that I'll skip it!

,weirwolfe,2012-07-31T09:37Z,I saw this a while back as a DVDrip. Absolutely horrible. How do they get the money to make movies like this?

,aradiel,2012-08-03T09:47Z,"I saw this movie a while ago, and while by no means brilliant, I found it watchable, all the way to the end.

The version I saw was horribly pixelated towards the end, so hopefully this is an improvement."
