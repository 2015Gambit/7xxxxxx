Hihintayin Kita sa Langit (1991)
After two long years ΓÇö a period that saw a severe drought of quality films in Philippine movies ΓÇö we now have "Hihintayin Kita sa Langit." Although it took a while for this type of movie to come by, it has certainly been worth the wait.

The script by Raquel Villavicencio was derived from "Wuthering Heights" (specifically the Laurence Olivier film version).

Carmina (Dawn Zulueta) and adopted kid (Richard Gomez) form an alliance against her nasty natural brother Milo (Michael De Mesa), the unfavored son of the brood's father, Joaquin (Jose Mari Avellana). When Joaquin dies, Milo takes over the household and reduces Gabriel to a mere servant. Although Carmina and Gabriel are very much in love, Carmina finds it beneath her stature to marry a stable boy like Gabriel. Blinded by the vast wealth of Alan (Eric Quizon), she dumps Gabriel to marry the rich boy. After a few years, Gabriel returns ΓÇö now a rich man who has acquired wealth through dubious means.

Failing to lure Carmina back into his arms, he marries Eric Quizon's only sister, Sandra (Jackie Lou Blanco) to spite his childhood sweetheart. On the night of the wedding, Sandra discovers at once how she has been used by Gabriel to get back at Carmina, who, in turn goes through a life of hell as she is kept prisoner by the jealous Alan. In the end, after a miscarriage and a suicide at┬¼tempt, Carmina dies in the loving arms of Gabriel. Ten days later, it is Gabriel who dies - shot by an avenging Milo.
