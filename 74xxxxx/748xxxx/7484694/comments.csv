Pushpaka Vimana is a 1987 silent black comedy,Pesum Padam in Tamil. 

Indian film, written and directed by Singeetham Srinivasa Rao. The 

film is notable for its inventive re-casting of the silent film 

form. The film was a blockbuster produced by Kannada film producer 

Shringar Nagaraj.[1]

Though shot in color and featuring incidental noise and sometimes 

songs in the background, the film does not have any audible 

dialogues between characters. Instead, clever cinematography, 

implicit and physical communication, lip movements, and creating 

scenes or shots where a dialogue would plausibly be absent are used. 

Additionally, crafty camera placement is sometimes employed to 

rationalize the inaudibility of dialogue. None of the characters and 

the city have a name."
