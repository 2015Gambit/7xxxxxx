,indiaman,2012-07-30T18:59Z,"dohduhdah,what can I say about you.You are a godsend for people like me.As I've said before,you'll be in my prayers.I thank you once again from the bottom of my heart for uploading these brilliant lectures My gratitude also extends to the original uploader.Please convey my indebtedness to him also.Without sounding greedy,can I ask you to upload ""MathTutorDVD Chemistry Vol.3 and Amazing Science Vol.1""."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-07-31T23:09Z,"@indiaman: I'll try to find them, but so far I haven't encountered those mathtutordvd courses."
,owatell,2012-08-01T07:40Z,"Hi,thank you for your uploads.I have downloaded many of your TTC lectures.Can you please upload the TMS lectures individually ? I am interested in history,economics and the arts.Currently the TMS lecture packs are poorly seeded.

Thanks once again."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-08-02T02:02Z,"@owatell: Sorry, uploading the TMS lectures individually seems a bit of a hassle to me.
I try to seed these torrents as best as I can, but when I've uploaded 120 gb or so for a 20 gb torrent I think it's reasonable to expect downloaders to do their fair share of seeding. If they don't, then apparently there is not enough interest in the contents or the leechers stop uploading as soon as their download completes."
,raenkae,2012-08-03T20:59Z,"Thank you very much dohduhdah. I have searched for this torrent for soooo long. You dohduhdah give me hope for an educated world.

I really thank you from the bottom of my heart, Let us all keep seeding as I believe knowledge will lead to a better world.

Looking forward to your next torrent. Especially now when demonoid seem to be down!"
,owatell,2012-08-03T22:08Z,"I understand,there are too many lectures in there.Thanks anyway."
