Actually if you do a little research You will find that You are quite mistaken! There are verified reports about punks running of at the mouth to him on several movie sets and He actually told them to bring it if they really thought they could take him. Most were smart enough to shut up and walk away, but the few who weren't got served a big ole plate of SHUT THE FUCK UP! Sure there was some showmanship from him but thats bcuz he was in show biz as well as the shuttin ignorant fools up biz and other things. So spare us your ignorance. Btw ask jackie chan he was an extra and on set for one of those days Bruce had to serve some punk. Mind your mouth. Your word and Your Balls are all anyone really has. Peace."
,NinjaVic76,2012-08-01T01:06Z,"Oh and Mad props to scene4all, Thanx for your time and efforts. Peace to all, even the haters, they needed most."

,Mnaytorri,2012-08-01T06:24Z,"And still not 1 TOURNAMENT Film. Im not say he wasn't a good fighter, i'm saying he wasn't what Hollywood made him seem to be."
,Mnaytorri,2012-08-01T06:25Z,"And I've been here on TPB since '07, so i aint going no where no time soon."
,maniaq77,2012-08-01T08:50Z,"how about some GODDAMN RATINGS ppl?

 Thank you scene4all."
,LittleAlienRobot,2012-08-01T23:56Z,"Bruce Lee Fought for his right to call him self one of the best. he had loads of Kung Fu masters to challenge him.. back then people didnt run around and film with an Iphone like today.. hell not even in the 80's was it normal to.. oh zip up a handheld camera. those things where big and unhandy .. planning before you would bring one of those things around with you..
theres some old fotage where you can see his real skillz - with real karate og kung fu praticineers :) look it up."
,Galaniel,2012-08-02T10:53Z,"Mnaytorri, Got a serious question for you...how old are you like 14 maybe 15?  You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and it shows.   Competition for people studying  Martial Arts were not exactly popular in the US due to different wars IE: WWII in Japan, and Vietnam. Most people in the late '60 early '70 were really racist against oriental people therefore not many Americans trained and therefore did not  compete and surely the ones who did, did not do it in the US.  So having no interest in the US one would go overseas to compete and back then they were super picky who and who not to train...being that closed off you think they would let some random guy in a competition lug in a 50 pound camera(cell phones with video recording options didnt exist) and film what  happened?    Go sit down at the childrens table junior, the adults are talking now."

,Ozi-miner,2012-08-03T16:55Z,"@ Mnaytorri:

Traditionalist Kung Fu styles are a way of life.  They are warrior disciplines, not spectator sports.

The modern competition sport of Wushu held its first World Championship in 1991.
Prior to this, Kung Fu practitioners wishing to participate in competition had no choice but to enter the Open Karate Tournaments.  The first ever Open Kyokushin Full-Contact Karate Tournament was held in Tokyo in 1969.

Bruce Lee died in 1973.
The internet was first invented in 1978.
Sony released the first camcorder available to the general consumer in 1983.
YouTube was first created in 2005.

No doubt you were born in the mid to late 90's."
,pbay80,2012-08-04T05:19Z,"LOL @ Mnaytorri.
Kids nowadays thought that if its not on youtube or video, it aint true.
They fail to take into the consideration of the tech back in the days, of lack of.
If they actually bother picking up a book and reading about it, they wont make such foolish comments.
I guess everything he sees on youtube are facts then... LOL"
,conflictcraig,2012-08-04T08:30Z,fukin young cunts... think there getting more stupid everyday... they know nothing these days
,Zenophobe,2012-08-04T15:59Z,"Thanks for the up.  This is the best documentary on Bruce I've seen, and I've seen almost all of them."

Please stop antagonizing the karate nerds. "
,4stanktoe,2012-08-06T03:52Z,"Chuck Norris retired with a karate record of 183–10–2.

What was Bruce Lee's professional record? 

He doesn't have one because he was an ACTOR.

And just because Bruce Lee beat Chuck Norris in a movie fight, does not mean that he beat him in real life.

You nerds have been in your mama's basement too long."

,4stanktoe,2012-08-06T04:37Z,"Gene Autry and Roy Rodgers were two of the best cowboys ever....or at least that's what Hollywood led us to believe with all those westerns they starred in.

They never really killed any injuns in real life. 

I'm sure this is a shock to some of you."

If you like to learn something new, here is the reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee.

Just my 2 cents here, at the time that I got my 3rd dan and had a competition in a south-American country, my Sahbum Nim (Teacher) and I refused to fight each-other for any titles, he was my instructor and friend, not needing to prove a point. I can see that Bruce had no intentions of a fight with his student.
Don't get me wrong, fighting is fun and it is the way to learn weakness within yourself, a good student always learns and I do hope that you do the same. 
If you have any knowledge of any martial art, one of the principles in all of them is respect, for self and others.

@scene4all, thank you for the upload!!!"
