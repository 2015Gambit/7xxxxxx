You need the data and then run the game.It works 100% tested by me..."
,copperhead33,2012-07-28T07:34Z,"after trying every other version, one finally works...now if only it was in english. thanks though."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-28T09:34Z,"@copperhead33

You can change the language to english or other languages that the game have at first start from the menu."
,sny0909,2012-07-28T10:59Z,still no success. still showing blank screen. It might not be compatible with S3. thx anyway 
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-28T12:05Z,"@sny0909

It must work.Remove the apk remove the obb file the sd data everything from the game and then follow the instructions exactly as i write them.I have tested this in many phones and it works.If you havent luck with this apk try the other apk from here:

,dighode,2012-08-23T20:25Z,"please tell me detailed procedure
i have installed the game and put data in correct directory
when i connect to internet for 1st time,it checks for license, my data in obb folder was deleted in 
i again copy the data and set my mobile data to 2010 and run the game but it shows the black screen
i am using samsung galaxy s2 i9100
pls help me"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-02T12:31Z,"@dighode

Do the following mate:

copy apk and data folder anywhere on your device .(do not put data on obb folder yet )

install apk and now copy ""com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftKRHM"" folder 
to android/obb/ folder.

disable automatic time and date .change year to 2010.

run the game

you must change the year before each time you want to play the game and just tick automatic time and date option after playing to return to present

The point that we must carefull is to change the date and the automatic date because due to this the date change automatically and the game gives black screen"
