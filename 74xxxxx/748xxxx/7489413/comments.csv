A lot of people download the torrents as a means to try a game beyond the pathetic demo's that get released as they can never give a game its true justice."

So much so that any sense of ""fun"" is sucked straight out as you try to defend 2 rifts, 6 doors, on maps that take as much as 30 seconds to get from 1 side to the other."
