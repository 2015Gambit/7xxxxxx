,cbboner,2012-07-29T14:14Z,Thank you so much for this!!! fantastic
,WJSS12,2012-07-29T17:18Z,"Is this the first release from FSS or the second one? Reason is, the first one has a bug in the wrapper that has the potential to erase all of FSX directory.

I think that the second release was uploaded to the server around 5 hours after the first.

Thanks!!!"

,namco-nexgen,2012-07-29T19:23Z,"Do you take me for some sort of idiot?

This is, OBVIOUSLY, unwrapped. Download, install, enjoy.

Jesus...."
,WJSS12,2012-07-29T19:51Z,"The question is, what download version is this though. I know the issue is fixed, but if this is the first one they put out, then maybe a new one should be uploaded to ensure that this won't cause anyone issues."
,WJSS12,2012-07-29T20:31Z,No need to be a pole-smoker about it......just trying to make sure. 
,aarque,2012-07-29T20:38Z,"The issue is with the original ORBX installer, like some of the PMDG stuff, it will delete your FSX scenery, specifically if you prematurely exit the ORBX installer. What dear WJS overlooks is that the poster, namco-nexgen, has already unwrapped it. If you have any concerns, don't exit the installer before it completes!

Besides, I don't see anyone commenting that this has deleted their FSX, which surely they would."
,WJSS12,2012-07-29T21:19Z,"Thank you,
As much as I would like to, I have no idea how to contribute and upload, so I am unsure of the process that is taken or skipped to make this stuff work. I was simply letting people know, as I read on their forums some people getting screwed, and didn't want it to happen here.

Was not trying to piss anyone off, but just thought I would place a notice. If the wrapper, as I was told is skipped, and already bypassed, then it is a non issue that I didn't know about in the initial post.

Either way, thank you for the upload and look forward to more."
,kingashi,2012-07-29T22:11Z,@ WJSS12..   so why dont you shut the fuk up.....
,peacerock,2012-07-29T22:52Z,Thank you for this torrent. Does anyone have Black Box Airbus Xtreme Prologue?
,namco-nexgen,2012-07-29T23:37Z,"Just to clear things up, even if it doesn't make any difference, since the issue was with the wrapper and not the ORBX installer:

 - This is the last version uploaded.
 - This version is unwrapped - No serial needed, nothing."
,Marklam_Voom,2012-07-30T02:40Z,"My god, the amount of stupidity on this site amazes me.
A guy uploads a torrent, and right after come the ""Hill Billies"" that can't read a f*cking news piece where it CLEARLY states that the problem was not with the OrbX installer but with the FlighSimStore wrapper. Then, as if it wasn't stupid enough, they attempt to induce their stupidity on others by saying that this is not unwrapped!
Well, guess what, I was the one who unwrapped it and send it to Namco to check it out. If this is the way you say ""thank you"" don't expect many OrbX torrents too often.

So to make this thing completely clear from now on:
This is the OrbX installer, UNWRAPPED, UNF*CKED, no serial needed and ready for everyone to enjoy.

Kind Regards, Team NexGen"
,Felidae17,2012-07-30T09:03Z,"Thank You. A fantastic piece of work! 
Thanks again for sharing"
,whtvr2,2012-07-30T11:59Z,"@Marklam_Voom, how about you focus on people giving thanks and not couple of people who isn't even complaning. I don't get people like you thinking of punishing others because of some people. This is the internet, don't do this if you are going to react like this.

Thanks for the torrent."
,turlututu,2012-07-30T14:55Z,thanks a lot for this
,Marklam_Voom,2012-07-30T15:33Z,"@whtvr2 My criticism was not towards you or all the folks that said thank you. I was just pointing those that don't read all the info about something they see.

Glad you all liked this release ;-)"
,mamute1970,2012-07-30T23:59Z,"Not of importance to these idiots who comment do not reflect the majority here.
Thank you for the torrent."
