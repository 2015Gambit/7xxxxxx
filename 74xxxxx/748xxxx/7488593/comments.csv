,rigmar_radio,2012-07-31T04:05Z,I wish someone in America would seed some of the excellent mainstream Pop and Dance tracks.   Hip Hop has been around since 1983 and I for one am getting pretty fed up with the whole thing.   I mean Rock and Roll did not run this long before it morphed into something else.   Time for the industry to MOVE ON GUYS...  Rigmar Radio
