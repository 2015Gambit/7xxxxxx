[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T22:24Z,@mariokkk
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T22:25Z,Install first titanium backup in your phone.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T22:25Z,Then make a backup of one game.Now see in the root explorer in the sd card.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T22:26Z,There is one folder named titanium backup.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T22:26Z,In this folder you will put both files from the torrent.Ignore fc means that when you run the game just ignore the force close.Press the home and ignore it and then follow the steps that i write in the txt file.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T22:27Z,"@citizn

You will download the data through the magnet link with mtorrent as everyone else."
,citizn,2012-07-29T23:10Z,do you need to root your phone to install titanium backup?
,citizn,2012-07-29T23:21Z,do i need to root my phone to install this? i installed titannium backup but i cant even use it
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T23:27Z,"@citizn


If you want to install this version you need root.If you havent root you can install this version from here:


http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7480610/Asphalt_7_v1.0.0_%28No_Need_Root%29_By_bobiras2009

and then just copy the sd data from here where i write and you are done"
,subaq,2012-07-30T03:57Z,"When I play the game, it says checking license, and loops back to the gameloft logo. What should I do? I followed all directions BTW."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-30T10:37Z,"@subaq

Uinistall and try again exatly.I think you are root for use the TB files from this release.Follow the instructions exactly and you will be ok.First install the apk but you dont copy obb files.Then follow the details.In the second run of the game the obb file will be deleted.You must copy it again.Then it will play 100%."
,galaxybay,2012-07-30T12:47Z,"the i have downloaded from @zinkooo is only 1gb and yours is 1.37gb .. what have you added in it and plus when i launch the game after copying the sd data to android/data location .... game is still asking for downloading . i cant understand why , its happens with all my gameloft games .. my phone is htc evo 3d"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-30T14:14Z,"@galaxybay

My data is extracted.The other data from other uploader are in rar files.I give my best atmy uploads.Follow my instructions exactly.If you arent root try the other version that i upload with the data from here.When you launch the game you must have wifi off."
,versus802,2012-08-01T19:16Z,bro i finnaly download the files but when i want to copy the extra content to the obb files it says copy error. b
,versus802,2012-08-01T19:32Z,finnaly works . thx bro 
,adi_rocks,2012-08-04T08:14Z,thnx a lot bobiras ur a legend.bt mate as u said that after 2nd run the obb files gets deleted.i just copied d folder to obb n it worked i didnt need 2 copy d data again..thnx alot. 
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-04T16:48Z,"@adi_rocks

Yes sometimes the obb doesnt get deleted.So you will be fine without copy the obb file again."
,sidqq,2012-08-07T16:10Z,"Hey thnks bobiros..i wont go in detail i just want to ask u that will this sd data work on both rooted and non rooted phones??..as i have downloaded your no root asphalt 7 apk,so i was just confirming that will this data work on that non rooted apk?...again thanks"
,laskar,2012-08-07T16:40Z,Hi bobiras22. Thanks a lot for this apk! I just want to know if the sd files for adreno and mali devices are the same. Some people have posted different sd files for different GPUs. Why is that?
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-07T19:43Z,"@sidqq

Of course the SD Data work with both rooted and non rooted apks.

@laskar

The SD Data that i uploaded is for all GPU(mali,adreno,tegra)."
,sidqq,2012-08-08T03:55Z,oh great...thnks for the feedback and your games!!

,laskar,2012-08-08T14:06Z,Hey..it works! Thanks! But I got it working in a different way...not by the instructions. I'll write that in your other post since my phone is unrooted.
,a5mid,2012-08-08T18:13Z,"hello there .. thanks for the torrent bobiras2009..
but i have a problem .. its when i copy the files to the titanium backup folder and open titanium backup pro to restore data ,,, the asphalt 7 restore thing want show ...what to do ?? please help ... "
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-09T17:30Z,"@a5mid

What you mean?Install the apk.Then place the two files from tb to titaniumbackup folder wherw all your backups are.Then make a reboot.Now open your titanium backup and restore only data for asphalt 7.Of course you must copy the obb file as i write in the txt.Then the game will be fine."

,3d1,2012-08-14T03:24Z,"hi bobiras22, mine is not work. idk where is the mistake, so i write all the progress when i install :D

first i install the apk file then run it, and the game will show the error message about force close, and i let the game running then i press home button to go to home screen. then i copy the com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA7HM folder to android/obb and copy 2 file of TB into TB folder and restore data only, when restore in TB, it will ask to close the application first, so i close it..
after that i run the game again, and the game will check update, if i choose yes, the purchase popup will show, if i choose no, it will keep asking about lisence verification, and the obb file is not disappear, what should i do?
"

,zoopyworm,2012-08-16T14:46Z,"Hi! Mine doesn't work. My phone is a samsung galaxy s3. When I open the apk for the first step, the gameloft logo appears then the screen turns to black and after a couple of seconds it will say ""Asphalt 7 has stopped"". For the second step, the obb file and the titanium backup files, it will reoccur. When I checked for the obb file, it's still there and not missing. What should I do? Help please. Thanks!"

First tell me your phone is rooted or not?If yes follow exactly my instructions here.It will work 100%.If your phone is not rooted download my other torrent of asphalt 7 for the no root devices and downoad the sd data from here."
,zoopyworm,2012-08-16T16:13Z,My phone is a rooted galaxy s3. Clockwordmod if im not mistaken.
,zoopyworm,2012-08-16T16:15Z,"@bobiras2009

Yes, my phone is rooted. I don't what the problem is but I think it is unusual. As far as the comments are concerned, I have never seen a case like mine. What could be the problem?"
,NarutoNamikaze,2012-08-17T21:03Z,"@bobiras2009

I have a non rooted Galaxy S. I downloaded that other apk file which doesn't need root. 
Please give instructions on what to do after installing that. As this one says about Titanium Backup."
,h-cat,2012-08-18T05:28Z,"your files are big. can you please upload compressed files? 

thanks !"
,NarutoNamikaze,2012-08-18T07:52Z,"@ bobiras22, @ laskar, @ sidqq

I have a non rooted Galaxy S I9003. My internal memory is 4 GB which is divided into phone memory of 1.7 GB which is inaccessible, and an internal SD memory which is 1.52 GB. I have an external SD card of 16 GB.

When I installed the apk for non rooted phones, it got installed in the phone memory and files appeared in the Internal SD memory. But I don't have any space in those. I want it to be installed into the external SD card. When I moved the app to USB memory in the Manage Apps, I think it was moved to the same Internal SD memory.

I still made an Android folder in the External Memory card and pasted the files there. But still it doesn't start like it does for laskar. After the gameloft screen, it checks licence and crashes

Please tell the instructions for installing this (I don't have Titanium backup, is it for rooted phones only?) possibly to the external SD memory."
