Enroute from Bombay to Santosh Nagar by train, Engineer Ratan meets with a dance troupe run by Professor Biharilal. Also included in this group is a dancer/singer, Roopa, who is attracted to him. When a group of policemen board the same compartment, a guilt-ridden Biharilal conceals a stolen necklace in the pocket of Ratan. When they reach their destination, the former instructs Roopa to get the necklace back from Ratan - and she sets about doing so - but both fall in love with each other. Biharilal is displeased with these turn of events and warns Roopa. But then things turn in his favor when Ratan departs for Bombay without informing anyone, leaving both to conclude that he may have decided to not only keep the necklace but they also come across evidence that he may fallen for another dancer/singer by the name of Lachchi.
