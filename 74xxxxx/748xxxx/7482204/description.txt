This is my 43rd official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show Olympics fans. 

I made this file as an MP4 instead of an MKV so that it will be playable with VLC player unlike MKV which is not normally compatible with VLC player and some BluRay Players. If you want it as an MKV file you need to convert it to mkv which is easy to do. I have included MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 (MKVmerge 2.2.0) with this release. Simply add the mp4 file to MKVmerge and in 5 minutes or so it will convert the mp4 to mkv without reeencoding the video. And then you can play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible once you burn it to a DVD +R DL disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and connect it to the BluRay players USB port.

 

Enjoy the London Olympics Opening Ceremony show Olympics fans and thanks for downloading my London Olympics Opening Ceremony 2012 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.
