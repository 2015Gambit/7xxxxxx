please stay connected after your download is finished to help seed the show for others still downloading it and enjoy the show"
,SCSA420,2012-07-28T10:23Z,I removed the MKVtoolnix program from this release but if you need it to convert the mp4 to mkv you can get it here:   http://www.dvhardware.net/software/12714
,SCSA420,2012-07-28T10:27Z,I removed the MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 program from this release but if you need it to convert the mp4 to mkv you can get it by searching Google.com for MKVtoolnix 2.2.0
,7valleys,2012-07-28T13:41Z,"Can you stop the jingoism, the Olympics take place in the UK and this board is Swedish, I'm Australian.  The American version IS NOT the domestic version, the BBC one is the closest to the ""domestic version"" since the Olympics are there."
,DimsumDynam,2012-07-28T14:30Z,"1. Are you high or drunk to be saying things like ""MKV is not compatible with VLC player""? If there is any player that would play MKV files - it is certainly VLC, so please stop stating false information. If you at least stated that you made it MP4 instead of MKV in order to make it available to more devices such as iPad/iPhone etc then that at least would have been a valid argument and totally made sense.

2. The reason your file is not showing up in the default TPB search (if you click the logo on the main page) is because you have titled it olympicS - remove the S and then you wont have to spam the hell out of other peoples Olympic opening ceremony torrents since your file will show up in the normal search. And yes you are spamming when you have to post a comment in everyone else's torrent and start it off with ""THIS IS NOT SPAM.""

3. If anything, this is the international version! As the other user pointed out - the BBC version is the domestic / main version."
,dino650,2012-07-28T15:07Z,This version is about 20 minutes shorter than the BBC version.

It is obvious to me that you have never downloaded any of my previous WWE and TNA wrestling releases because if you had then you would know that not all mkv files out there will play in VLC. However they do play in media player classic and windows media player when you have K-lite codec pack installed on your computer as well as any BluRay players that are mkv compatible like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and my LG BP-620 3D BluRay player. I personally put all my mkv HD video files on a 3 TB Seagate USB 3.0 external hard drive and then connect it to my BluRay players USB port and play them back on my 55 inch LG 55LM7600 240 Hz 3D LED Smart HDTV. Oh and this mp4 file plays fine on my Samsung Galaxy S III 32GB 4G LTE smartphone. I don't do drugs or drink alchoholic beverages and I couldn't care less about whether you want to argue over the word Olympic vs the London 2012 Olympics which is what they seem to be calling it on tv in the USA and that is all I have to say about that."
,ps7825,2012-07-28T17:17Z,"I have downloaded 2GB and seeded over 20GB, what the fuck man?"
,PC800,2012-07-28T19:08Z,"Good quality, but please just skip this bullshit.  The commentators are two horribly ignorant pieces of shit, and NBC cut to commercial during at least two very crucial moments during the show, once during the memorial to the 7/7 attack in London, and again when the torch was entering the stadium. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.  You will be disappointed.  Get the BBC or Canadian one. Or Greek one even.  Just not this one.  This sucks. "
,neosanx,2012-07-28T19:13Z,Seed please! Come on!
,PC800,2012-07-28T19:23Z,"Do not download this pile of shit.  Video quality is good, but NBC's commentary is worse then bad.  Not only that, commercial cuts during crucial points in the show.  Skip this and wait for a good up of BBC broadcast.  At least the BBC doesn't hire drooling idiots for commentators, and they don't cut to commercials during crucial points in the show."
,DimsumDynam,2012-07-28T20:15Z,"@SCSA420
I don't really care for your ""ooh look I have so much money that I can afford this tv and that blu-ray player"" - you can make your point without having to boast about what electronics you own! Ooh you have a big e-penis.. *yawn* Bottom line is ANY mkv file created properly should work fine with VLC. If YOUR home made ones don't work with VLC then you clearly have to teach yourself how to encode and work with video again. I have downloaded over 500 scene release mkv files - movies, tv shows, documentaries and also home made mkv files here on TPB by ppl doing their own encoding and not one has ever failed to work with VLC, which tells me its your video encoding that has a problem! 

Also me telling you to remove the ""S"" from the word Olympics was to help your torrent be found by default when people search, but hey - if you want to be a stickler about it - that is no loss to me! Clearly you don't want this to be popular and seeded. No wonder you have to desperately spam other peoples torrents to bring attention to your own. Wow, are you THAT lazy to edit a friggin torrent?!! Oh FYI, it's not Olympics - it never was and never will be. It's the Olympic Games - the event is singular, games however are multiple. That's your ""learn something new"" for the day, you're welcome!"
,SCSA420,2012-07-29T04:23Z,Whatever man. Its not my fault about the NBC commentators who to be honest I wasn't really listening to them as I was more interested in the show itself and this is the only version I could watch here in the USA at the time but I have since watched the 3D version on N3D on DirecTv which is way better in 3D but unfortuately it can't be captured due to HDCP with the equipment I have here or I would do so and upload it.
,Diesel67,2012-07-31T01:52Z,I downloaded the torrent and it has no sound.  What's wrong?
,SCSA420,2012-07-31T04:51Z,This show has 48khz 384 kbps AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 channel audio maybe you need to install AC3 filter or the K-Lite codec pack with media player classic on your computer because it plays fine here with no problems
,the_devious,2012-07-31T14:07Z,"OK, so I ain't gonna shoot down a bro' that put in the effort to encode a DVB stream and up the result for all who want it.  Even so, I would like to raise a red flag regarding recommendations releative to K-Lite code packs (or any other codec pack fro that matter).
Man, those f*c|"
,the_devious,2012-07-31T14:09Z,"Full edit...

Man, those codec packs are pure poison. All they do is screw your system. If you use VLC Player or KM Player... YOU DON'T NEED CODEC PACKS! Those players install their own embedded codecs without doing any damage.  Bottom line... if you've got some obscure video file that won't play in VLC or KM Player, just trash it.  It ain't worth the aggravation you'll get from installing a codec pack.  Just my 2 cts."

,the_devious,2012-07-31T14:15Z,Jeez... sorry for the multiple comment. TPB wasn't showing my stuff on refresh.
,SCSA420,2012-08-03T15:00Z,Sure is funny but I've been using K-lite for years now and I've never had a problem ever using the K-lite codec pack and media player classic home cinema that comes with it to play any kind of audio or video file and personally I have VLC and I don't think its as good as media player classic home cinema is which plays everything I can throw at it unlike VLC which seems to be picky and not play some video files but then again You have to configure K-Lite properly to get the most out of it but that is'nt hard to do actually its easy to do.
,zwqd,2012-08-10T06:16Z,Hello SCSA420 CAN YOU PLEASE UPLOAD THE NORMAL 720P VERSION PLEASE?I DON'T LIKE THE CLARITY OF THE MP4 VERSION BRU.THANKS..HOPE YOU UPLOAD THE ACTUAL MKV OR 720P VERSION.!
