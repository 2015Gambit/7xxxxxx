,GrayFox1080p,2012-07-30T05:18Z,Ok
,GrayFox1080p,2012-07-30T05:20Z,"Ok I fixed the shotgun issue, so here's what u do:

1. download Popstation GUI v2.21 Beta 

2. Change the Game's ID to  SLPS02180 (Japan Version,it wont change the language so don't worry)

3. also change the folders name ""Dino Crisis"" to SLPS02180 and paste it to PSP GAME 

and I used Popsloader 4.01 so I haven't tried it with a different one yet.. so far the Game its working perfectly no issues at all 


Enjoy :) "
