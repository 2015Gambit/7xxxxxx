Dino Crisis features a game system similar to the Resident Evil titles that were previously released. The player controls Regina, a member of the special forces team that is sent to investigate an isolated military facility that became infested with time-displaced dinosaurs as a result of a top-secret experiment. Because the enemies in the game are dinosaurs rather than undead creatures, Capcom promoted Dino Crisis as a "survival panic" in contrast to Resident Evil's survival horror label.
