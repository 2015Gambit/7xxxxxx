Because its ""beach"" volleyball. Might as well criticize bikinis in general. While I won't deny the sex appeal of it, I don't think it's totally unfair either. If girls had a choice of swimwear, I'm pretty sure they would still choose to wear a bikini. Girls enjoy looking good. In the past girls had to be covered up all the time (some still have do in certain cultures) and they had to fight for the freedom to show some skin."
