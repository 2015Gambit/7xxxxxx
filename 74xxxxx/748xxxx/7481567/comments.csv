[V],TorrentTracts,2012-07-28T05:28Z,"Soggal, stuff you probably already had.  And I have only been collecting Stitchie's music since he chose Christ in the late 90's.

Couldn't find anything in my collection for St Matthew, Mr Danny, or Judith Gayle."
,soggal,2012-07-28T05:41Z,TorrentTracts i really hope i'm not asking to much but do you have any Bobby Tinsley?
,soggal,2012-07-28T05:43Z,"Man you are the best, i really wanted that last album from Stitchie, and i'm really only intrested in the stuff he did when he got saved. Thanks again man."
