I am sick if dickdeads like you writing fake or something before testing it. I just finished downloading it and it is not a fake."
,irishspam,2012-07-30T07:50Z,"Anyone can put eztv at the end of a file, as eztv's sight says always double check its really eztv. Basically go to (eztv.it) if they up load it it will be listed, this is a fack but it isn't a eztv fake its someone trying to slander, and/or use the name in order to mess with ppl. Again eztv has as far as i know only uploaded quality material but may ppl/associations try to use their name in the description for slanderous, malicious, and selfish reasons.                       Find eztv by using website eztv.it or google eztv"
,Granchy,2012-07-30T07:58Z,"3 hours after it aired and eztv doesn't have it up yet

therefore, i'm trying this one"
,cor.hor,2012-07-30T08:04Z,"@vh-bil
I am sick if dickdeads like you downloading videos from known fakers or something before even looking for someone who doesn't fake. I just finished downloading the other copy of this episode from the same person and it was a fake.

If someone is stupid enough to upload a FAKE copy of a video and then half an hour later upload another one, people should warn others in the comments IMMEDIATELY.  ettv should be avoided from now on.  One fake and how can you be trusted anymore?  You know the saying""once a cheater always a cheater""?  Well ""once a faker always a faker"".

If a guy cheats on his girlfriend, and then he gets a new girlfriend, the first girl SHOULD tell the new girl that he's a cheater.  Sure, he might not be cheating this time, but he was just cheating.  In this case only half an hour or so passed.  Definitely not enough time to start trusting ettv again."
,Granchy,2012-07-30T08:10Z,"actually this same guy put up the last fake one

maybe i'll hold off"
,vh-bil,2012-07-30T08:49Z,"@cor.hor
Are you stupid? I said it isn't a fake! It is just a small download. If you wanted to warn people you could have downloaded it to test it yourself (but you are a tight ass with your internet) and then let people know.

Dumbass!"
,cor.hor,2012-07-30T09:17Z,"@vh-bil
Are you stupid? I said that this guy uploaded a fake! It is just a small download, but why download something from a guy who uploaded a fake half an hour ago? I wanted to warn people because I just downloaded a fake from this guy, so I let people know.

Dumbass! "
,vh-bil,2012-07-30T09:47Z,"@cor.hor

IF YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE FAKE TEST THE DAMN FILE!!! DUMBASS!

What is wrong with you? I am trying to say you could have tested or even warned people it is a fake like a normal person and not written fake heap of times like a dickhead which is what people are going to see on a video that is not a fake.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE FAKE TEST THE DAMN FILE!!! DUMBASS!"

,obvious2me,2012-07-30T13:38Z,"What is with all the idiots like cor.hor spamming VIP uploads claiming fake?

Downloading right now because I know ettv is legit, and always has been for me."
,obvious2me,2012-07-30T13:44Z,"Also, note that this upload is over 6 hours old now and TPB is extremely diligent when it comes to removing fakes (Every fake I've seen has been removed within 30 minutes). 

This is clearly not a fake.

,Retrenched,2012-07-30T14:03Z,Leave poor cor.hor alone - he's just another hapless TeaTard who's trying really hard to grasp a small semblance of reality...
,sputnikwood,2012-07-30T17:20Z,Legit copy. Good quality. choosing this because of higher video bitrate vs the 300mb versions.
,alberto34,2012-07-30T18:35Z,@cor.hor.....der r many people downloading frm ettv frm long tym..i have been doin dis da same frm past one nad a half years...nd ettv never let me down...so stop bullshitting...
,fiveofseven,2012-07-30T18:52Z,"Just verified NOT a fake. Sure anyone can label a file 'ettv', but this IS from ettv. Never a fake here. Thanks for the avi"

THIS IS WHY I YELLED FAKE
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7487154/Breaking_Bad_S05E03_Hazard_Pay_HDTV_x264-FQM%5Bettv%5D
That link right there is what ettv claims to be this episode, and is a fake.  Since ettv is trusted people won't even look at the comments to see if it is fake, so I put fake many times to alert people that ettv is now uploading fakes.

This isn't someone who wasn't ettv who uploaded the fake claiming to be them, click on ettv's name right up there ^ look for the breaking bad torrent with Hazard Pay in the name, it's a fake.

I don't know how you people can't understand this.  We should stop downloading from ettv becuase they are doing fakes now.  Maybe not every time, but once you do it once you are not longer trusted."
,cor.hor,2012-07-30T22:43Z,"And apparently that one is now a legit torrent.

I do not know what happened, but the first people who downloaded it got an encrypted rar and a link to a phising site, and later people got a legit copy.

I think ettv owes us an explanation as to what happened.  I won't trust them again until they make some statement about this.  "
,noyieldingcode,2012-07-30T23:00Z,"As someone else said, ANYONE can put ""[ettv]"" at the end of the filename and make it LOOK like it is ettv uploading. BUT, look at the fucking USERNAME and verify that ettv put up the damn thing and not some other random username. Oh, and chances are, if the torrent goes up AN HOUR before the show even fucking airs (as was the case last night) chances are that, yes, it will be a fake. But then again the ones uploading those torrents last night WERE NOT EZTV or ETTV they were RANDOM usernames. "
,BuzzDave,2012-07-30T23:54Z,damn trolls....
,obvious2me,2012-07-31T17:03Z,"@cor.hor 

The torrent you linked is, and always has been a legit torrent. The content attached to the upload doesn't miraculously metamorphose from scam to legit.

What you and so many other fucktards downloaded was uploaded by an untrusted/non-vip under the title that contained ""[ettv]"". Then the group of idiots that 'done fucked up' on their own account, had the audacity to hop on the legit uploader's content and make jackasses out of themselves.

Learn to read prior to slandering a great uploader you douchebag.



To everyone else, again, This upload 

""By: ettv {VIP}"" is legitimate."
,alvin1983,2012-08-01T13:03Z,"Great upload!!!
I don't know why they say fake but it's great for me!
i saw it and it's top upload!"
,Odd_Ball,2012-08-01T21:25Z,Then he or she needs to say respond to the ( Fake ) comments . i wont dl from ettv anymore. to many protected rar files. that go to stupid sites.
,Ozi-miner,2012-08-02T11:46Z,"Christ you people are fucking stupid ...

The fakes you've downloaded have exactly the same title names as the real torrents, even including [ettv] or [eztv] at the end ...

But if you check the ""Uploaded By' section you'll notice the fakes have been uploaded by ""anonymous"" and not ETTV or EZTV.

You've mistakenly downloaded the fake file, which has then been removed by the admins, then you've returned and posted your comments about fakes on the real torrents ..."

In future take the time to check who the uploader actually is & click on the number next ""Files"" to see what they actually are, rather than just reading the title of the torrent & blindly downloading."
,wabblt,2012-08-02T22:58Z,"Ozi-miner has it right. ETTV does *NOT* post fake files. (look for the little green skull) However, some idiots see ettv in a file's name and assume it is from him/her. This file is 100% real, is not password protected, does not lead you to a phishing site. Ignore the MPIAA posts that this is fake, they're not just wrong, they're deliberately lying."
,mr.deeley,2012-08-06T07:54Z,"Works perfectly, thank you ettv.  Thanks to the honest people out there who actually checked it.

@cor.hor

You've made a fool of yourself writing 'fake' all over the place without checking.  The download completely works after you put 100 'fake's on it.  What does that make you?  How much does your 'fake' comment mean now, or ever again?  NOTHING.  Just like you're worth.  A half an hour fake download by the same guy of the same episode an hour before, makes no sense.  You have found one of many imposters; not the fault of this uploader, you stupid little turd."
