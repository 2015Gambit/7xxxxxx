Angie Aparo - Partial Discography (Lossless Format)

Angie Aparo is something of a monster waiting to be discovered. For those of us who have discovered him, he's given us a soundtrack to our misgivings about the world that still leaves room for hope. It's the kind of sound we can believe in, one that provides a backseat to the low rumblings in the back of our minds and a steady march to help us find our way back home. I wish program managers had their finger on the pulse enough to follow artist like Angie Aparo.
