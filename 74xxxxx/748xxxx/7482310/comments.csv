,randomannoyance,2012-07-28T17:15Z,"Thanks for the upload!  Quality work!


See, what you whining jerks can't seem to understand is that in order for people to seed effectively, you have to finish the torrent so you aren't just recycling the same files around.  
So right now (with the ratio 1 seeder to around 100 jerkbags) hardly anyone is getting new files.  

So back off with the ""PLZ SEED!!! THX!!"" and bad grammar and be patient for your free stuff."
[V],extremezone,2012-07-28T17:29Z,just add more connections now are 400 sedders from public and about 2000 from private TOTAL 2400 seeders
,Mercer99,2012-07-28T17:35Z,"@Randomannoyance
Completely true, there is literally 1 seeder per every 12 downloaders, and I doubt that all of them are running 10mb/s upload servers purchased from NASA. The problem isn't a lack of seeds, it's the amount of people torrenting at once. If you want faster DL's, disconnect and come back later or find another torrent with less people on it."

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7488133/Prototype_2_Proper_Crack_Only-SKIDROW

for me fairlight release was perfect, maybe it's from you pc,drivers,etc"
,Darkbotz,2012-07-30T14:15Z,"XHaloXX and the fellow pirate bay users plezz use the PROPER CRACK FROM SKIDROW AS FLT CRACK AS GOT SOME DRAWBACK AS MENTIONED BELOW from the '' leading force SKIDROW ''

The guys from Fairlight have recently started to do some Steamworks CEGreleases, and while it's abosolutly fantastic to see them compete with the rest of us, their method simply dosen't justify the effort they put into this.                                                          There are several reasons, but here are the two most interesting ones:                                         

1. CEG Routines are not resolved, instead a part of ceg is emulated to   calculate the right values, respect for the research on this, but can lead to false results and slows runtime down.
                                                                                           2. CEG and CRC is still active, can`t run under debugger neither using   a ""Trainer"" 

While the second option isn't a reason to proper, it's not living up to the scene rules.                                                                                                                           So now we have decided to proper Fairlight's Prototype 2 release,because our crack is fully reversed and CEG free. Which gives the end
user a more stable crack, with less crashes, startup problems gone,fast loading, better framerates etc. are some of the problems that our  fully reversed crack prevents.                                                                                                                We encourage Fairlight's crackers to run our proper under debugger and set breakpoints on these examples offset's, to see how different kinds of ways CEG get resolved.                                               10569E10, 10569D70, 1055CF40, 103036F0 and 1010E960                                                                                        There are of course more, but this will give insight into, why your way of killing the CEG checks with mov,al 1 - just isn't optional for all users, because the CEG does not always gets calculated the same on  each machine.                                                           If you still don't get what we mean, then contact us, and we'll help you.                                                                    What's even more sad, is that Fairlight got the knowledge to properly  reverse the protection and in the end it's actually not that hard to  do. So why not do it the quality, tradition and pride way?"

was the most recent set of STOP codes."
,phat_71,2012-07-31T00:52Z,"Another interesting note about the Ram considerations. When using Windows 7 you're far better off having 5+ gigs than you are with 4 or less. With 5 or more the OS allocates a portion of RAM for the sole purpose of driving itself, meaning it doesn't have to compete for RAM while anything else is running. 

Another suggestion for those with lower end systems, GameBooster. Do a bit of research before using it so you can know what's safe to disable and what isn't. I've done a few tests with it and gotten results of 4-10 FPS difference when using it as compared to not. That might not seem huge but it can be the difference between choppy and not.

Also check to make sure things like DirectX, PhysX & Cuda (or whatever equivalent), and any other related drivers are as up to date as possible. And about DirectX, now that we've got 9, 10, and 11 games are becoming more complicated. Some games on certain systems might run better configured for DX9 or DX10 or what have you.

My last advice is to go to and sign up on Game Debate. You can fill in profile information listing all your system components and such, and whenever you check out a games info there's an very handy system that compares your system against the game specs (Ie, minimum or recommended requirements)."

,RafVne2,2012-07-31T14:10Z,"Hi there.
Thanks again buddy for another great release. You are considered around here something of a ""Rock Star"" he he he... better nobody fuck with you... :)...

... And... as a public service...
This torrent did not work for me on XP x86 (standart crash error), and even though 90% of stuff works on my xp install it is possible I may have some service disabled, cause that system is set to be ""just right""
If someone got it working on XP let us know please, just to confirm it. 

Second try... I ran it on Win7x64 partition. It worked. I didn't have to even reinstall, just booted to Win7 and run .exe... Did have a lot ATIkmad stopped responding though... but again this install has allways been giving me hard time with that error.

So.... I logged in to a third win install... win8x64 preview... and so far, runs great... no slowdowns no crashes...

So there you go... oh... BTW does anyone know how to disable the ""camera auto center"" thing?

Because this is one of those rare games that plays better with controller, but not with that stupid ass centering bullshit, if I can't figure it out I'll play key-mouse....

ok, take care I'm off to google for a solution to that camera thing."

I still didn't find the fix for camera I guess I'm just gonna use ""Joy 2 key"" really nifty emuu can replicate everything on the controler but it uses keys off the keyboard.

Dude with the keyboard buttons thing.... I'm guessing it's a wirless right... Iknow that on my wireless mouse I can push only two buttons at the same time (except the main ones) that might be your problem, My keyboard works fine(wireless too)...


About the music thing... I have a certain sentiment regarding those little demos. They are made ,it seems... with an old school sound generating techniques, I remember those demose playing on my Commodore64 he he he.... but it was too loaud and too long.

And one more thing.... PPL stop yelling seed!! Seed!!!
IT""S NOT GONNA CHANGE A THING. First of all if someone is just plain leach... he's gone and won't be back to read you annoying comment.... but more importantly... you do realize that ppl that downloading this stuff, do so, caus' they are broke... so what do you think what kind of service can they afford T1... T3 maybe... My cheap ass service allows me to download (after midnight though) 1 MB/s, but you know what is the most I can upload 50kb-55kb and it's running 24/7 to make it to 1:1 ratio I have to seed it for a few weeks...

It was a bit slow in big fight occasions, like my PC wasn't good enough.....don't know, either that or maybe it could be solved by lowering graphics a bit.

uhm unninstall it, then check if there are still some files in the old instaled folder.
delete em
now do the instalating normally with the fairlight exe in adm mode.
accept the patch and the syn library update options.
play the game directly from the folder where it's installed and for the first time in adm mode.

i know it's the bassics but it worked fine on me and i'm already finishing it.

,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-08T00:34Z,"It's a shame. The sorry state of video games today. 1 hour into it, then just youtubed the ending. I am about done with gaming. Give us something memorable. Something with depth. Why are games targeted only towards Teens and Early 20s? Where are the new ideas? Mature ideas. Longer, in depth endings? Why don't they make a game that Starts with a question, and ends with an answer? These games aren't worth the time we spend on them let alone the money. Not worth the money. If developers get their heads out of their A$$es, maybe the $50 will be worth spending. But it's not. Forget the replay value, that comes from a memorable character. Maybe extras. In the future, I think we will be able to interact with main characters, ask them questions, get to know them, etc. Mysteries are great, but then answers leave you satisfied. This isn't just about this game. It's every single scorched piece of trash game that's out there. Even Mass Effect 3 was a let down. Repetitive, lousy, rushed, stupid stories. We are sick of deformed alien looking things. It's getting old. Long live torrents. Let the idiots buy this junk. If I've offended anyone, it's probably a good indicator of their intelligence level. Thanks but no thanks. Waiting for something I can play, then say ""Yeah that's a game I would buy."" Not all gamers are kids with no life experience. Give me something to think about instead of walking away disappointed.  "

It would be nice to see a game that is catered towards a more mature gamer, rather than simply A is good B is evil, fight to the death. The game also fails to explain why Mercer is totally out of character. I guess I offended too many people. "

ME3 with the awful ending? no ladies and gentlemen, this game took the cake. NO explanation why mercer became EVIL, lame excuse why mercer's sister sided with heller (I remember the mission in prototype when mercer chase the brawler who kidnap dana), besides the tentacles, no real changes in the powers avail in prototype 1. stupid ending where in heller tentacle-consume all the zombies in NY then when you continue all the zombie are still there. I can go on forever with whats wrong with this game but the one thing that really piss me off is heller himself. I don't care if a hero has questionable morals but you simply just dont make your hero an uneducated punkass mouth! just because many gamers speak like that doesnt mean that you need to make the hero/character of the game speak the same just to make him  RELATABLE. jeez, the final battle between mercer and heller became an annoying insultfest with the theme like ""YO MOMMA SO FAT..""

Such as DeadSpace for instance. Deus Ex HR, another great game. Heck, even Binary Domain was so much better than this. The point I'm making is, this game just skipped a whole Version! Are you so dense that you didn't vomit right at the beginning? Heller sees Mercer drop kick a chopper, but still keeps going after him! WTF. If you saw a man break a tree into half, would you continue to chase him with your butterknife? I mean WTF!? I put up with the shoddy beginning. I played through it.

,xaloponx,2012-08-13T09:50Z,"This version works.... BUT, BUT
It has a problem. I have an AMD 6 cores 3.7 GHZ, Ati radeon HD6990 dual core video card, 4 GB of fast ram, win 7 64 bits... All games in my computer run fast as hell at the MAX LEVEL OF DETAIL at 1920x1200, EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE. The first minutes run perfect, fast at the highest levels of detail... then, it start getting slow and slow and slow. Why they develop this game in DX9??  who knows, but this game is like GTA, the game is fine, but the performance of the game itself is crap. This game, doesn't work smooth for me... Activision should lern how to develop games.
Anyway, that's for upload the game, but too bad the game is crap."

I agree with you, DeadSpace could be better. Who likes dumb zombies that come out to waste your time? But DeadSpace had a story. A decent one. Some underlying messages, and it was based off of some past games, so the story was interesting and the game kept you involved. "

 - Insert the disc into your DVD-ROM Drive, and wait for autoplay to run. If prompted, select Run Program.

 - Select ""Uninstall"" from the Autorun menu.

- Log into your Steam Account.

- When prompted, select ""Delete game caches"" for ""[Prototype®2]"""

It's like they figure, well if we can't beat the crackers, we'll make our games so shitty on the computer that only people whoa re rich and have 8000 dollar computers can work around the HORRIBLE porting, those people are buying the games anyway, the ppeople who pirate the games proly won't have a computer that can play the game so pirating it is useless.

But what they don't understand is that we pirate to make sure it's not a shitty game, it's actually what it's been made to be, and IT'S NOT HORRIBLY PORTED!"

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7488133/Prototype_2_Proper_Crack_Only-SKIDROW

Then when you play the game if you feel that the frame rate of picture is getting slow go to the menu of video resolution and select any one of resolution then press apply but when it asks for conformation click to NO this will definitly clear your memory and your game's Frame rate will become normal.
