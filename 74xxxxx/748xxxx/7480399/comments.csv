See first I downloaded FeDor crack then i got this error XnetSetup failed then I searched and i saw a video on YouTube in that a video had explained how to fix this so i download file's which he(youtube) gave me then copyed ""Fedor crack and all the files"" so I shared in torrent if any one else is also having this error he/she can get it fixed."
