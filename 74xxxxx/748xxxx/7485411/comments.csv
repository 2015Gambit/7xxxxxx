MPC-HC plays it ok but all other players show a duration of 12 hours instead of 6 hours causing the audio to be out-of-sync.

I'll change the MP4 file to MKV and re-release as a PROPER. The problem could be because the file is just over 4GB and MP4 (in 32bit mode) only allows upto 4GB files."

I've swapped the MP4 container for the MKV container which has fixed the wrong play duration in VLC.

Luckily the video was less than 4GB otherwise it would have needed to be re-encoding again.

Small mode MP4 is restricted to 4GB. Large mode MP4 would work but is unlikely to play with PS3/Xbox players similar to MKV."
