,elroy23,2012-07-29T12:25Z,Tinfoil hat alert!  Tinfoil hat alert!  Somebody let the loons out again.
,GeorgeWest,2012-07-29T15:53Z,"No, its not tin foil hat stuff. There is strong communist mentoring in Obama's past. Many gullible people that were fooled into voting for him must remain in denial of their own complicity in an act of treason. That's where the tin foil hat stuff comes from. Gullible idiots in the voting booth that can't accept what they did."
,Basuto9,2012-07-29T20:20Z,"Well, George, I guess I'm one of the gullible ones fooled into voting for him and remaining in denial of my own complicity in an act of treason, and you know what? I'm going to commit treason again and vote for this Muslim/communist/born in Kenya president (I'll bet you're a big Orly Taitz fan).
I also spent three years in the Army in the 60s fighting for my country - how about you?"
,Basuto9,2012-07-29T20:22Z,"Sorry, there should be a ""once more"" after (I'll bet you're a big Orly Taitz fan)"
,GeorgeWest,2012-07-29T21:06Z,"No, I actually think Taitz is a phony, just trying to set bad precedent like the ACLU does in so many cases. Well its now apparent that you were also fooled into fighting for the interests of Wall Street bankers while you thought you were fighting for your country. Just who was attacking us that required you to defend your country? Patriotic fools like you will never learn. Next you will be telling us why our children should fight and die for Israel. Normally I would try to sell a bridge to a guy like you. I got a whole bunch of bridges just for you - today only."
,GeorgeWest,2012-07-29T21:54Z,"""All war is based on deception""
Sun Tzu - The Art of War.

If you study the book, the deception has nothing to do with military strategy or deceiving your enemy. The deception is in fooling soldiers to fight for this while its really about that. The deception is about fooling you into believing you are on the moral side of a war. Sun Tzu also said the victory always goes to the side with the TRUE moral objective. Funny, the US never really wins any modern wars.

""We Can't Leave Afghanistan Now, They Have Trillions of Dollars of Minerals""
U.S. Gen. David Petraeus

Go watch his speech on YouTube. You fool. This is the kind of stuff you get conned into fighting for.

They got you real good. You probably still think I'm safer today because you killed brown people.

""Anyone that can be deceived into giving up liberty for safety deserves neither""
Benjamin Franklin

Also, Taitz fans believe that Obama was not born in the US. Those that believe Frank M. Davis is his real father are quite the opposite. Davis was a porno photographer in Hawaii and an outspoken card-carrying member of the Communist party. He was actually on an FBI list of people that must be immediately arrested if war broke out with Russia. Once again, your inability think logically gets exposed. Living in a cloud. Either too much military indoctrination or too many vaccines. Probably both."
,elroy23,2012-07-29T23:11Z,"Poor George, you're such a tool.  How's that 6th grade education working out for you?  Things getting bad down there at the gas station where you work?  South Carolina no longer the redneck haven you thought?  Go ahead and vote for Rmoney.  Prove to the world how stupid you really are."
,shamanist,2012-07-30T01:11Z,"Well, I see that the tards, the loons and yes the tinhat crowd are out in force with this one. Must be the outing day at the asylum. 

As a lifelong Marxist and Socialist, I can tell you from the bottom of my red heart that Obama is no Commie or any shade of Red. He is the product of that wishy-washy leadership committee that gave us middle of the road Democrats like Clinton.

@GeorgeWest--a bit of advice--It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. It would appear your are part of the FoxNEWS/Murdoch Reaganjunge...

,LordGod88,2012-07-30T02:45Z,Obama and Romney are both frauds.  They are puppets for the ruling elite.  The system is broken.
,Stanselm,2012-07-30T22:46Z,I didn't know Glenn Beck had so many accounts on PC.  Good for you Basuto; former Vietnam Vet here too.  These others are just whining pussies.

Gee, guy, you seem to be confusing Baby Bush and Iraq with Obama.
