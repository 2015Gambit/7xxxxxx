it just means people have to sift through a never ending stream daily routine uploads that a bunch of you are making a career out of !

This for example is re-uploaded on a daily basis for no good reason, the first upload was packed properly and has the nfo etc and was released a by a trusted source AND it has WAAAY more seeds so the speed WILL be faster

I don't have much choice but to keep an eye out for certain user names that do this and try and filter through and ignore any uploads by certain users in order see anything useful when browsing"
,xpmule,2012-07-29T17:50Z,"by the way i just looked and you uploaded 12 torrents in a row. + 2
All of them but one was already added by one or more people and about 13 of them were added by previously by mrriser007 previously. (a couple are older versions)
And he DID give credit where due.

Honestly i don't mean to be a jerk but what you did looks weird to me and the only thing i can think of is you have done this all for attention, because why else would someone bother ?

Its kinda hard to pretend you don't know about the search engine when its at the top of every single page at TPB.

Basicly i want everyone to see my comments and think twice before downloading. Don't think I;m trying to pick on this guy, i'm not..
I'm trying to save some people time and effort. rather than assuming a new upload is new ? consider it may be someone repacking and re-uploading the same thing you might have seen the day before lol (and possibly worse too)

Ya wonder why so many people have a bad opinion of TPB lol"
