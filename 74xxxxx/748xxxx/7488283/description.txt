A story about my uncle is a first-person platform adventure game made in the Unreal Engine. It is a story about a boy who searches for his lost uncle and ends up in a world he couldn’t imagine existed. The game is made by students at Södertörns Högskola’s game program. The assignment was spread over the course of eleven weeks and three courses. The requirements was to make a non-violent, first-person game in the Unreal Engine. It was the first time the students had worked with the engine.

The game focuses heavily on a grappling hook-mechanic that gives the player a wonderful sense of speed and freedom. The player can also use various types of jumps and leaps. An early assignment was also to write a deep and engaging story that the player would like to immerse himself into.

The goal for the group was to enter the Swedish Game Awards 2012 with the game which they did and the game was  nominated for the category game of the year.
