,violet1143,2012-08-13T09:18Z,@Timbo6669 - Probably so.
,Timbo6669,2012-08-14T08:34Z,"Sorry guys...cant seem to crack this one...ive actually been able to crack other securom codes, but not this time...they seem to have compressed shitloads of code and cant even seem to hack and decode it??? wow....need more luck...you do know that the best protection is made from old pirates that were offered jobs to avoid jailtime...so it's pirates vs pirates and dev hackers seem to be on top of it...YOu TRAITORS!!!! hehe.."
