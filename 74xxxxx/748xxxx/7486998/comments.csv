,globle_figgie,2012-08-02T04:19Z,awesome :)
,leahpea3,2012-08-03T07:55Z,this skipped for me around 6:25 (VLC player) and 6:50 (Windows Media player). it's not my computer because these files have worked many times. there was an issue with episode 6 as well so this is a repeat occurrence. thanks anyway. :)
,leahpea3,2012-08-03T07:57Z,"I should mention that even though the skips were at different times, it was at the same exact moment in the show. weird."
,ASDFMonster,2012-08-05T02:40Z,"leahpea3 : Yeah, the same skip happened in last week's episode as well, at nearly the exact same point. Not sure what's going on. No problems in other versions of this same episode, seems to be exclusive to Secludedly."
,b00tstr4p,2012-08-09T06:07Z,I cant play it in mac with VLC applying the options what you mention.
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-11T09:26Z,yeah ive been having major issues with my cable company. been fighting them on and off. it seems in my area the bandwidth usage is so high during true blood's airing that my broadcast shits itself since everyone is watching it. i usually have to wait for the reruns on monday or wednesday. ep 9 doesnt have the issue and ill be sure to do my best as usual.
