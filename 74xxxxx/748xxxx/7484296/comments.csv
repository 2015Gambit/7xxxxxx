Film implies that being poor is permanent - class system known from Norman slave country: UK."

@ G-rad, if you want to see the lie of your statement, just look at America for the last 32+ yrs where the poor population has grown and the middle class share of the wealth declines every yr.
You're right being poor isn't permanent ""IF"" you take back control from so called free enterprisers."
