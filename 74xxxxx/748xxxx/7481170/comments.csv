,Spectre_nz,2012-07-28T06:55Z,lol @ first comment.
,damnannoyed,2012-07-28T07:28Z,"LOL@Spectre_nz 

1st commenter has a point as they're all the same copy.. just a bunch of torrent nerds claiming it as they're own for one reason or another"
,ironymon,2012-07-28T08:08Z,two retards above me... he probably meant we need new cam video because we already got decent audio... audio is about 6 and video 5 for a cam... It should be at least v7 a6 or similar.
,wendelj,2012-07-28T14:19Z,Same old garbage copy. Don't bother with it. 
,You_Muppet,2012-07-28T14:57Z,"With a nod to @Silencer7, I also downloaded 5 versions of this torrent and here are my scores: 

A-5, V-5, 1.86GB - RESISTANCE uploaded by S4A
A-5, V-5, 2.17GB - FUTiLE uploaded by TvTeam
A-5, V-6, 2.17GB - INSPiRAL uploaded by S4A
A-6, V-6, 1.94GB - UNiQUE uploaded by Mantesh
A-7, V-6, 1.87GB - TS Xvid 26K uploaded by Froggie

For me, the last print is the most watchable because of the audio. 

S4A: you are still the man ... or the wo-man."
,tflagger997,2012-07-28T18:00Z,Exact copies of material already on TPB should be deleted.  Like this one.  It just clutters the place up and wastes our DL bandwidth/cap and time.
,michaelrwatson,2012-07-29T00:01Z,"I tend to agree, BT most times the original loader (e.g. 26k) could do two things:

1. Use better filters to make the copy as good as possible (instead of just posting it asap), and 

2. Make it smaller. There is no discernable diff. between a 2GB file and a 1GB file (at e.g. 720x288). 

Then, so many people wouldn't be trying to incrementally improve it."
,some-young-guy,2012-07-29T14:24Z,"Keep in mind that if a specific torrent was released by only one uploader for the sake of bandwidth and simplicity, investigating and prosecuting authorities would have a very easy time tracking IPs of all seeders that have that torrent simply because it would only be limitted to one release of a torrent.

Pros and Cons either way."
,maxmaxpayne,2012-07-29T15:01Z,"seems to me that the camera operator put vaseline on the lens, notice the lines to show inconcistency in thickness, not the first time i readily noticed it."
,monkeybot12,2012-07-31T04:39Z,"to all that are complaining,
