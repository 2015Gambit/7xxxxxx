These douchebags of national TV (France) replay it on the web but only the begining. They don't realy show it out.
I fucking pay taxes!!!

Great you guys (especially you grenn skull buddies) are there to help little people and morrons like me to savour this freakin' great moment of real sport.

Deep Thanks Sceneline.

by the way, excuse my french, but don't upload .rar. It's too bad, I cannot watch it in streaming with my Âľtorrent.

Nevertheless, keep up the green skull work "

Eurosport HD

Hope they wont spoil the show if Cavendish do not burn the finnish line first.

Great work green skull"

Great Stuff!!!

Thanks a lot Sceneline.

It's much better edited and commented than it is on french tv for the Tour De France.
And with no adds!
Freaking wasted taxes!!!"
