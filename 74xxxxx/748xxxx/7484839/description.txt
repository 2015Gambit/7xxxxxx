Description

Are you fed up with common boring blue folders? With Folders Factory, you can easily change their colour, add pictures, include text, assign textures or even make them look like "embossed" system folders.

Doing this will improve your performance and your systemΓÇÖs appearance. YouΓÇÖll no longer have to read folder names as you can now easily identify the one you need.

The application is very user-friendly. All you have to do is: drag the image you want into the applicationΓÇÖs window, configure the way it looks, and then drag the folder you want to modify there too. Done.

Tips:
- To reposition an object, move your pointer over the object, and then drag the pointer.
- To rotate an object, put your pointer outside any corner of the bounding outline around the object and drag.
