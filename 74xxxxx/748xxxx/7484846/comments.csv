Yeah, the DVD doesn't come out until September, that does NOT make this a fake torrent! So stop spreading rumors and shying people away from this Good File!

Thanks for the upload!"
,82bear,2012-08-01T00:41Z,"It's not a Dvd rip, It was released today as a ""Video On Demand"". SOOOO someone has ripped it from that for us. Thank you ""scene4all"". I appreciate it."
,piratingnoob,2012-08-01T01:49Z,God i was hoping this was about slenderman....

We're not about censorship here. He has as much right to post his worthless comment and you did.
Try to post something useful instead of crying like a little bitch when you don't agree with someone."
,dlarrym1111,2012-08-01T07:22Z,"TO all that want the truth on this films release date, 
IMDB list it's RELEASE DATES as:


COUNTRY:	      DATE:

USA	          12 March 2012	          (South by Southwest Film Festival)
Hong Kong	  19 March 2012	          (Hong Kong Filmart)
Canada	  19 July 2012              (Fantasia Festival)
Canada	  19 July 2012              (Fantasia Film Festival)
Germany	  25 August 2011          (Fantasy Filmfest)
USA	          31 August 2012	  (limited)
France	   5 September 2012	
Turkey	   7 September 2012	
Belgium	 19 September 2012	
Spain	 21 December 2012

     It does list the LIMITED RELEASE DATE for the USA as: (31-8 -2012).

     HOWEVER, It was RELEASED at the -SOUTH BY SOUTHW WEST FILM FESTIVAL-
ion: (12 March 2012). DVD'S were available to purchase.

SO, It was ""released"" in the USA at the film festival.

SO: @arif24888, Your are WRONG! A Release of: ""THE TALL MAN,  took place at a 
Film Festival, in the USA on: 12-3-20121 YHIS IS OVER 5 weeks ago.

@arif24888 : where on earth do you get your info from. Further more, the 
PURPOSE of this site IS to find MOVIE(s) -TV shows BEFORE or ON There 
actual public release date. When looking through these Movie lists, DON""T base the legitimacy of a movie based on it's release date.


Great Upload , Great Quality!"

Good rip
--------------------
IMO;

Jessica Biel should fire her agent for letting her do such a crappy movie. It starts pretty good and gets you interested, half way through the writer decides to make things confusing. A lot of movies have weird twists and *shockers*, this movie FAILS something epic at trying to accomplish that note.

At the end of the movie you're left feeling like you've wasted your time.

~ IMO"

totally sweet thriller!!!"
,whymichael,2012-08-01T23:48Z,"Anyone saying this is a junk film is really simpleminded and plain. WAY cool thriller that keeps you guessing and throwing you curve-balls throughout. 

Biel's actually a really good actress in this.

Nice surprise. Thanks scene4all!

,Cyberdetta,2012-08-03T14:00Z,"good quality vid, crappy movie"
,thenaughtons,2012-08-05T18:43Z,wow very interesting movie! tons of twists and turns. the best part is that it is not predictable like most movies are. i had no idea what was gonna happen. well worth watching at least once.

Neither are you.

Seriously? Your comment towards mikeike65 was so unnecessary and doesn't make sense at all. You are are fuck head.

,dwiss,2012-08-12T04:27Z,"To all you n00bs out there... movies are often released in other regions of the world before they are released in the USA.  So, the DVD can be available, say, in eastern Europe long before it's even in the theaters in the States.  So, if you don't know what you're talking about, maybe you should shut the fuck up."
,jcallen1103,2012-08-14T13:55Z,"Absolutely Fabulous.  REAL RIP!!!  Thanks!!  You can't always go by the US release date.  ""Taken"" was actually released a whole year earlier on DVD in France.  Watched the DVD rip 6 months before it premiered here in the US."
,Emplehod,2012-08-26T05:17Z,"I must say, this movie begins in the typical fashion, then at some point you say ""WTF?"". Such a twist that you start to think it makes no sense. Do not stop watching it. It will make sense toward the end and it's good.

Thanks for the upload, wonderful quality!"
,Emplehod,2012-08-26T05:21Z,"And for you who have posted that this movie is bad, you either have very poor taste or poor comprehension, not sure which. This is the best movie I've seen with Jessica Biel since 'The Illusionist'."
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2012-09-16T09:33Z,thnx!
