1) you don't have to put tnesrc in the file names if converting something of mine. it was never about 'stealing' sources. it was about butchering them with improper encodes. mentioning the source in the description is plenty.

2) your complaints about scene. they are people; not machines. if they don't release something immediately maybe it's because they have to get up early for work or work a night shift, or they have a family to spend time with, or they went on vacation. just remember they are human beings with real lives away from a computer so please don't bitch if they don't release some show shortly after it aired.  this goes to everybody, not just psspss."

blah blah about stealing and giving credit ,,,

despite I always listed the source of the convert

quote not the first time you said this either and your followers

That's bullshit. You did get it from my blog. You're right about nobody leaking it. You stole it. You knew people were anxious for Destination Truth so you stole s05e02 cuz it wasn't anywhere else

Again I got any sources via other trackers and sources never been to your blog ever or download from jumbo"
