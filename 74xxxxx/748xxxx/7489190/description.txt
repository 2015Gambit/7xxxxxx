Drunvalo Melchizedek Earth Sky Heart Workshop 13DVDs 28hrs 2011


The Tetrahedronal Mer-Ka-Ba (the human light body) was geometrically and mathematically introduced to the world by Drunvalo Melchizedek in late 1984, but by the mid-1990ΓÇÖs it became clear that the Mer-Ka-Ba was only the beginning of a far deeper level of consciousness unfoldment. To bring this necessary additional information to people who had learned the Mer-Ka-Ba, the Earth-Sky Workshop was created. Still, by 2003, the Living in the Heart┬« book was written, and it became further necessary to intergrade that information into the old workshop and the Earth-Sky-Heart Workshop was born.

This gave a person who had previously activated their Mer-Ka-Ba everything they needed to ascend into higher levels of consciousness. But by 2011, a new approach to this information was released in a workshop called Awakening the Illuminated Heart┬« making the last workshop unnecessary except for people who had received their knowledge from the Flower of Life teachings. For them this Earth-Sky-Heart Workshop is exactly what they need. So on the final Earth-Sky -Heart Workshop given live by Drunvalo on April 11-15, 2011 to 124 people, we professionally filmed it. We preserved this workshop just for you, so you will be able to complete your journey into higher consciousness. This workshop has never been released on DVD before, and it is Hollywood quality.

To truly understand the content of this DVD set, you need to have read three books, which were a prerequisite to this workshop. The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life, Volume I & II, and Living in the Heart┬« by Drunvalo Melchizedek.

This is a 13 DVD set about 28 hours long. Price $390.00
