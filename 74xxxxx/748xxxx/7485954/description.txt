IPhone 3G with 4.2.1 (8C148) Firmware and 06.15.15 Baseboard installed recovery. Included are the Instructions, FirmwareΓÇÖs iPhone 4.2.1 (8C148) Restore, iPhone Custom Firmware 4.2.1 (8C148), iPad1,1_3.2.2_7B500_Restore, web addresses and redsn0w 0.9.6rc16.  Compressed with 7zip, the 32 bit and 64 bit of 7zip is included so that you can unzip it. HereΓÇÖs all the things that you need to take your iPhone 3G and install the latest firmware and to install Unlockit.co.nz. You will need to Jailbreak it to install the iPad 6.15.00 baseboard. Also if you ever have to restore the phone the instructions and the means to do it. The instructions are in Note Pad and in Microsoft Word, so if you can read you can do it. If for some reason redsn0w doesnΓÇÖt sense your iPhone, do it on a different computer. My computer isnΓÇÖt on 24/7 so Leechers get it when IΓÇÖm up and Seeders seed. This isnΓÇÖt copy write protected so they canΓÇÖt bust you for downloading it. There is also redsn0w 0.9.6b5 for those that donΓÇÖt want the 0.9.6rc16. Because this will work for anything from 6b5 to 6rc16. Also there is iREBr5 for anyone that has an error when trying to restore. This will help fix it or at least tell you how to fix it.  Lastly there is the iPhone Configuration Utility. ThatΓÇÖs it, if you canΓÇÖt fix your iPhone now then either take it to an Apple Store and see if they can fix it or buy a new 1 and start over.
