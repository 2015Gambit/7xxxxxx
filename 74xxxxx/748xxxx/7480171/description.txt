                           DESCRiPTiON 

 As people get in shape for the Olympic summer, Shelley Jofre presents a 
 Panorama special testing the science behind claims by some of the biggest 
 sports brands. Using the findings from a study by the British Medical Journal 
 and Oxford University, she examines products ranging from trainers said to help 
 people run faster and drinks that help them work out longer to protein shakes 
 that are apparently more effective in honing the physique than ordinary food.
 
                                
                                 Enjoy!
