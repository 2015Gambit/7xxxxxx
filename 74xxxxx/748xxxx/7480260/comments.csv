,aenaonbay,2012-07-28T13:26Z,Is this the large (4gb) app that unibeast needs to work?
,jdcoder,2012-07-28T18:47Z,"aenaonbay, 

exactly that is. At least it worked for me and now I'm getting excited of Mountain Lion on my hackintosh"
,RicMar,2012-07-28T19:00Z,0% ???????
,anger98,2012-07-28T19:17Z,I think this torrent is dead
,anger98,2012-07-28T19:18Z,BTW I have found that the MD5 of the latest DMG is the same of the Gold Master: 8b4869920cd740414fe6b7e3f0b1be3e please confirm this
,aenaonbay,2012-07-28T19:39Z,@jdcoder great to hear that. It is the first I've seen like that. The only problem seems to be with the distribution. All peers still report 0%
,ImAPotato,2012-07-28T22:40Z,@jdcoder would you be able to upload a torrent without InstallESD.dmg? Spent 3 days downloading the wrong torrent for UniBeast. Thanks man
,farid.saleh,2012-07-28T23:15Z,"thanks alot , after 24+ hours it completed ,  i just installed the os x mountain lion  on my macbookPro 2011  ,  it works perfect  ,  without any problem ,   i will seed it for a few days  ,    :)))"
,RyanDude9,2012-07-29T07:04Z,Where'd the seeder go? 0% 
,awesomeme22,2012-07-29T12:15Z,No seeders? All on 0%...
,kihtrak,2012-07-29T13:01Z,No seeds
,DimanZee,2012-07-29T15:23Z,"Goddamn, I've been waiting for this soooooo long!!! Big thanks for ya!"
,DimanZee,2012-07-29T15:25Z,"I don't understand your logic, people. You seed useless MountainLion.dmg's InstallESD.dmg's, but the fucking APP has no seeds?!?!?!?!?!? "
,DimanZee,2012-07-29T15:26Z,Some kind of a Troll torrent i guess)))))
,aenaonbay,2012-07-29T22:03Z,"Yeah, we've been trolled allright. 3 days in, every peer has 0%
Nice played"
,jdcoder,2012-07-29T23:20Z,"guys I'm sorry for such a speed - the matter in my internet provider and I can't do anything else.

As for InstallECD - IT IS NOT THE ECD IMAGE. It's an application which has to be written on usb and then used to install Mac OS X Mountain Lion.

And my apologies for any inconveniences."
,aenaonbay,2012-07-30T12:24Z,"""guys I'm sorry for such a speed - the matter in my internet provider and I can't do anything else.""

lol, what speed? you haven't shared a single MB in days. This is not a torrent that will take ages to finish. It simply won't. Ever."
,sheeptwo,2012-07-31T00:26Z,trolololo lololo lololo
,Deraga,2012-08-09T18:01Z,"I found another OS X Mountain Lion App that has seeders
