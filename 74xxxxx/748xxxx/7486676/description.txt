Obscure and hard to find, this was the first solo project by Will Sergeant, lead guitarist for Echo And The Bunnymen.  Released in 1982, this release features a bonus song not on the original recording, the last song "Favourite Branches".

If you're expecting any similarities to the Bunnymen's music, you'll be disappointed.  This is almost unlike anything out there, imagine Radiohead's "Treefingers" from Kid A.  No hooks, hardly any guitar, and yet captivating from beginning to end.

Definitely helps to be a Bunnymen fan, and worth hearing at least once.  If you can give it time, it absolutely grows on you.
