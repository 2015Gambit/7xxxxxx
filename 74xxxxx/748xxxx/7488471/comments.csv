,MP4Only,2012-08-02T07:56Z,"It would be a crime not to seed this, this track is just too fucking awesome."
,Dasturdly,2012-08-06T13:45Z,C'mon people seed... should not be stuck at 98% for such a small file. Especially when its this new.
,CrazyPieGuy,2012-08-07T19:49Z,Been stuck on 98% for the last four days.
,sardis12,2012-08-08T05:07Z,"If you get to 98%, stop your torrent. Load the file in Audacity. Export as 320k mp3 with a new filename. Works fine. 

No idea wtf the original seeder did to the front of the file, but there's your fix. "

,ymom2,2012-08-13T02:49Z,It works even though it only gets to 98%.  Don't ask me why.
