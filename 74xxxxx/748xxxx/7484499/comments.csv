,Leobons8,2012-08-13T21:46Z,"Yes, I scanned just the beginning because I'd never seen this book for downloading anywhere and I thought it had too much valuable information not to share."
,jackieboy000,2012-09-05T21:03Z,"BEWARE:

This is not even ""the beginning"" of the book...this is photocopied pages of chapter 2 and chapter 3...and then a bunch of economic charts.

If anyone can get a full version (pdf, ebook, audiobook...anything), please post link here."
