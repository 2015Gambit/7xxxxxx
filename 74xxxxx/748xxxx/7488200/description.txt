Hearkening from Italy, Sorry Ok Yes, has a name that may suggest a tenuous grasp of the English language, but be not fooled - this duo is well versed in Rock as well as Roll, as evidenced by their single ΓÇ£FacedownΓÇ¥ which tried to capture a 1930ΓÇÖs blues aesthetic whilst retaining modern sensibilities. This seems somewhat typical of the band, who do not describe themselves as ΓÇ£hitmakersΓÇ¥, but are more interested in creating rock and roll ΓÇ£momentsΓÇ¥.
