,bobbybrow,2012-07-30T04:17Z,"For some reason (possibly imax scenes) the beginning few minutes, and a few other short sections are in 1920x1080, but then it switches to a cropped letterboxed screen which I really dont understand what the point is of reducing the size of the file if you cant play it on a standard 16x9 screen.
This means a then displayed resolution of 1422x800 if you want it to match your screen.
But this even happens with smaller Dvd films where people rip them to something like 720x280, when size doesnt even matter, does anyone know why?Â 
To solve this you have to zoom to 135% for 16x9 monitor. Which takes some fiddlying in VLC player in preferences, you have to restart player after changed. Under advanced settings in video, then can enter value in Zoom field
