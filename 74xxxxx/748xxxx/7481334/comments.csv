,moeburn1,2012-07-28T12:42Z,is the whole movie supposed to be as dark as the screenshots indicate?
,blahstar,2012-07-28T15:43Z,"Is the camera used to film this movie not as good quality as hollywood movies or does this bluray rip just look bad? It just doesn't look as sharp as it can be and the colors seem off for me.

Wait for another rip or this is as good as it will get?"
,Morot1230,2012-08-21T19:49Z,"horrible subtitle quality, minor spelling errors, missing words, insanely bad grammar and sometimes its total gibberish, and there was some signature or something from the dopehead that babelfished this right in the middle of the movie"
