Find a couple of the most common classic discs for example Nirvana Nevermind.
Make sure you have a flac image (not tracks)
Burn that to a cdrw and throw the disc in, done :)

the big problem is that there are only so many test discs authenticated by accurip so your kinda screwed if you don't have one of them, hence my work around.

If you know about this problem then you probably understood why i posted ;)"

cuetools.net

As secure as EAC, if not moreso. Faster than EAC. Less futzing around with drive settings (and none of those FUD settings spread by elite EAC setup guides). Everything is included for FLAC + AccurateRip, or MP3, APE, etc, if you prefer those other formats."

and have used Cuetools 1,000+ times

and in case people didn not undesrtand my comment i was saying that only for people who are ripping a cd with EAC and they want their drive accepted by the included accurip plugin."
,temporary2010,2012-08-01T13:15Z,"People who use EAC should definitely use it with AccurateRip.

Even if you insist on reading the disc four times (No C2 = twice, Test & Copy = two more times), you can still get consistent errors.  So PAY ATTENTION to what info you get from AccurateRip.  If one track shows a mismatch, but the rest are correct, then you've probably got a consistent error.  Rip it again with another drive."
