It would also be nice if the encoder had trimmed the commercials better, as there are some audio blips during the commercial blackouts, like they didn't trim enough frames out either before or after. This also occurs at the start of the episode, before the opening song starts.

The bitrate (and therefore file size) also seems kind of high for a 22-minute cartoon.

I don't want to seem ungrateful (thankyou, BTW), because I love this show, and it's incredible in its original, full-screen HD format. But I do feel like these are some legitimate criticisms. Overall, I'm pretty happy with these and would recommend them."
