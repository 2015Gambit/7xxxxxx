This is the first time that the actual episodes have been officially presented
in their original, uncropped, widescreen video format in any fashion. When they
aired back on Cartoon Network, the video masters had been cropped to a fullscreen
format, which is also what the DVDs used. Even when released in the Japan, the
japanese dub used the cropped fullscreen masters with some added background
borders to "fill in" the missing widescreen space. And now, for the first time
ever, we are able to properly view the Transformers Animated cartoon in its
original, unaltered, widescreen format with everything in full view, and in HD.
