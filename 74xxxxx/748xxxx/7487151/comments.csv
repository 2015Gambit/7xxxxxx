,Enolena,2012-07-30T06:05Z,"I appreciate you, Dibya.  Since Douche Network dropped AMC, I depend on you for the Heisenberg Chronicles...LOL

  Thank you for all that you do."
,skweets,2012-07-30T06:27Z,"Thanks Dibya, your uploads are so much better than scenelines."
,Moops420,2012-07-30T07:33Z,"Hey Dibya, fuck you and your password and .rar files"
,ironymon,2012-07-30T07:51Z,"producers won the battle, AMC renewed the season for 14 episodes or more, originally they wanted for it to be only 6 episodes, so directors/writers went to consult with ""Saul Goodman"", he fixed shit up fast."
[T],dabadguy69,2012-07-30T07:53Z,thanks for the upload DibyaTPB. 
,Fitzy727,2012-07-30T10:39Z,"Thanks as always Dibya! +1

And fuck that Moops420 kid, he obviously has no clue what he's talking about.  Everything released from Dibya is 100% legit and perfect quality."
,Feltzem,2012-07-30T12:58Z,I don;t understand how my download speed is about 50kb/s when there's 4000 seeders?
,s_jimmie,2012-07-30T13:03Z,"Yepp, Dibya's releases are the best. THE ONLY torrent with a d/l speed worth trying. The others don't even get up to 100kb/s."
,PauloFran,2012-07-31T01:03Z,"Nice video quality.
Thanks!"
,PauloFran,2012-08-01T02:14Z,"Very nice video quality.
Thank you!"
,Archon12,2012-08-01T12:09Z,"Dibya, I hope you stick with us for this final, bittersweet Breaking Bad season (and for much longer than that even!). It's nice to have a single go-to uploader who clearly knows how to encode--I don't even bother looking elsewhere anymore. +1 always"
