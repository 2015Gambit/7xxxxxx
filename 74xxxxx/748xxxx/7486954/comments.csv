,beebeerubi,2012-07-30T14:58Z,I always been a little apprehensive with downloading with you because I was a EZTV fan for a while before I starting seeing you post. In the beginning your files were all fucked up and totally noob like. But they're practically perfect now and you even post this WAYY before EZTV. So even though both you and EZ have posted this episode I decided I'll give my seeds to the person who I assume woke up at the crack of dawn to post this for all of us.
,Fallerup,2012-07-30T18:30Z,"The users I find most useful for series like this one are EZTV and ETTV. Always top quality. So thank you ETTV for a great upload yet again. Not done downloading, but it goes really fast and I'm sure the quality is good as always."
,mvewtcher,2012-07-31T02:22Z,"For some reason, this won't play on my media player via the tv, when all other mp4 files do. File converter can't open it to convert either"
,non46,2012-07-31T02:33Z,Be careful. Shit is tracked. Woke up to find a nice warning from my ISP.
,anthraxtheterrrible,2012-07-31T05:27Z,"thanks, apologize I cant seed - moving tomorrow"
,lauregasm,2012-08-06T19:00Z,Woop woop! Thank you!
,anthagio,2012-08-06T20:05Z,"Yep, this torrent is being tracked.
