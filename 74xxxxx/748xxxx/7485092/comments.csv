,gamester2,2012-08-01T00:50Z,"ok i guess noone wants this, i'll give it till midnight for someone to ask me"
,Doodaday,2012-08-01T01:57Z,"It's still downloading for me. Been stuck at 40% for almost a day. Just recently got to 42%.  

The combat in Xenoblade gets much better, especially once you get used the whole combat mechanics. The special attacks you learn really change the way it's played "
