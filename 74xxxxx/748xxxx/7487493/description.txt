I'm an independent comic creator.

Included in this torrent are samples of a couple of comics I wrote. I did not do the art, but I care enough about accomplishing this goal that I have paid artists to do work for me.

You can view what the pages look like on Deviant Art.

The gallery's you'll want to check over are Growing Pains, Modern Hood & The Legend Killer (Final version).

Modern Hood has been picked up by a publisher and is still in development.

I own the rights to Growing Pains & The Legend Killer.

If you're interested in supporting me financially. You can get a digital download of the full version of the books for .99 each at Drive Thru Comics.
