converted web stream to xvid 640x360p mp3 128 1000 bit

just some of the latest UFO related news and sightings
and a talk with Erin from chasing UFOs after


Not much happening lately.. with the games taking over tva as if
everyone sits in chairs in front of tv watching sport all day every
day how boring.. so theres a few shows and things coming out lately

having a quick look about the only ufo sightings for Jul can be debunked
one in the Oylmpic games opening.. obviously a drone blimp with camera to film
down and some footage from nasa showing a lightning storm and
objects that could be sprites and ball plasma.. so I didnt bother converting
and adding stuff thats easily debunked and not confirmed to this collection
however more triangle craft and fireballs spotted over UK and Russia

I wait for the best of ufo sightings compilation to come out.. prob show up
in 2 of august which will include those no doubr


help to seed if grabbing this, cheers
