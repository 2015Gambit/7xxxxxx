psspss, We got a lot in common.
Same TV shows
Same Torrent Client
And i use to live 2 towns above you (on google maps)

You seeing ChemTrails out there ?
We sure get a lot in British Columbia !
Checkerboard sky's are not uncommon
I've even seen these jumbo jets spraying and then make a turn and toggle on and off the spraying leaving breaks in the ChemTrails, so obviously if it was a contrail they wouldn't be turning around after leaving the airport and then shutting the engines off in a turn LOL

I agree with other people when they say this is the biggest conspiracy in history.. global wide.
I've seen enough with my own eyes and taken my own pics etc..
I even have pointed the weird patterns in the sky and people just shrug their shoulders and look at my like I'm crazy.. Idiots need to learn to look up away from their bloody cell phones lol"

[V],psspss,2012-07-30T08:37Z,"i forgot to run this file through
AVIMux_GUI so it aligned on interleaves
(although ive only staeted using this tool
all other UFO converts may have split
and if you didnt have a issue then no need to worry about this feature being unset in the file!)

so if yo get slight out of sync.. perhaps
fix it yourself.. its a free tool google it
and takes less then a minute to enable that
avi audio feature.. although I use CBR
some dvd players still might drift

its a little doogey interface though..
1) right click add avi
2) click the big button under called generate
I know it dont look like a button it go me
at first
3) click save and give it a name for avi

1 min.. done"

,SerSpec-V,2012-08-01T03:26Z,I was surprised to hear her admit that some UFO believers are critical of the show and the way they do their investigations. There sure are Erin.
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T17:00Z,"I see the watch movie and total recall 2012 is up on tpb now
