IS IT A GAME? IS IT AN ELECTRONIC ALBUM? WELL??? 
IT'S BOTH!!! 
ZonK's debut album, an "electronic soundtrack" to the bong smoking dice game, is a cornucopia of mixed electronic blends, analog synths, dumped in a hazy smoke filled room. Twelve instrumental tracks provide the mood to sit back, roll some dice, and smoke some herb. These songs will uplift your day to new heights, complete with all you need to start a game of ZonK with your friends. Smoketronic music for the soul. 

Five Dice are included in the spine of the phyiscal release of the album. Rules are included in both physical and downloadable releases.
