,.Leto.,2012-07-31T02:33Z,"Horrible quality, you really fucked up with your filters on this one. As you can see on this picture 
http://i.imgbox.com/abbp1xgs.png it doesn't even look like a movie anymore, more like a cartoon or anime. All faces look like they're covered with some oil, they're all shiny, glossy.
I got the PublicHD release, even though definition is lower at least faces look real."

,.Leto.,2012-08-01T07:51Z,"@ G3tm3soda: It doesn't look like a cam at all, it's just that all surfaces are way too smooth. His rips are usually great, if you like ultra sharp picture, but there's clearly a problem with this one. To his defense original picture is already quite bad, really low budget movie."
,dzver666,2012-08-04T01:38Z,tnx 4 the comments on quality
,moshster,2012-08-26T20:47Z,Audio is awful too.  At several points the audio drops out completely.
