But it happens a cruel murder: Anna Isenhart's great love is brutally murdered - in her breast a gaping hole in her heart is missing. Isenhart vows to bring the murderer to the track. When he witnesses a murder further, having the same profile, he makes the acquaintance of Henning and his foster father, Gunther Medicus.
