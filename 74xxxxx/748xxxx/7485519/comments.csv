Working Fine
Try the t-kfstwr.cue

all i see is the bin, cue and system info files and VLC icons on the bin and cue.

double clicking the bin or cue file opens vlc and does nothing.

what do i do?"

,mycheeks12,2012-08-03T20:10Z,"this works men!! 100%.. i'm running at win7 64 bit. you gotta have poweriso dude, extract the t-kfstwr.cue (not the *.bin ok) to any folder, then run the set-up.exe, install the Microsoft XNA.  From the extracted folder TinyISO, copy the all files into your game folder (Kung Fu Strike - Warriors Rise).  then run KungFustrike.exe.. Oh and don't forget to seed this great torrent!!!"
