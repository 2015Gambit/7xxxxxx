,KJ6VIP,2012-08-01T05:29Z,"From what I can see thus far, this game works perfectly fine.  My only gripe with this torrent is that it took about an hour to decompress and install.  

I appreciate the contribution and upload.  I see many hours of enjoyment.  Thank you."
,superspingas,2012-08-01T15:23Z,"I'm having a bug problem with the game? Is anyone else having the bug where when you start out the game, the animations of doc mitchell are really bugged up? For instance his head will start to spin and he is stuck in a sitting animation. I even made it out of his house and talked to a person, and their animations were bugged up too. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,superspingas,2012-08-01T20:35Z,"Okay, so I fixed my problem after researching and came upon a guy on youtube and this was his reply.


""Possible solution: when ingame, check in the display options for the bars for the ""**** Fade"" and change them. For me they were all down to 0, which actually explainsďťż how it comes that all animations were bugged: when a character is ""out of view"" (the distance is actually specified by the ... fade bars in the options) the character animations won't play anymore to improve performance.
So turn the bar for Actor fade to about half (lower or higher, depending on the desired performance)!""


I checked my display options ingame and all of the fades were 0. My game works perfectly now. Thanks for the rip!"

[V],gansuk,2012-08-08T03:36Z,"the ultimate edition has all dlcs, preorder packs and patches. so you only need this torrent for the full collection."
,lira90,2012-08-08T12:52Z,"Can someone walk me through the set up of this. Im a noob, sorry :("
,Snowman515,2012-08-08T17:48Z,"How is this ultimate edition only 3.85gb?
cause I've been searching around and I find it that the game ranges over 10gb and around there....
So how does this work for 3.85gb???"
,Snowman515,2012-08-08T17:52Z,This includes the whole game and all the dlc???
,moochukka,2012-08-09T03:45Z,I registered just to be able to say thank you. Decompressing and installing was easy and the game works perfectly. We played it for hours and not a glitch so far. Really appreciate the time you guys spent doing this!
,lira90,2012-08-09T03:52Z,So maybe some instructions on getting this set up?
,Snowman515,2012-08-09T04:01Z,
,Snowman515,2012-08-09T04:06Z,"@lira90
I downloaded the game and I havent got around to playing it yet but from my experience with torrents and games off pirate bay, I downloaded the torrent and opened up the folder
Next, I Run the installer (install.exe) as administrator, afterwards it comes up on the screen and you click install to a destination of your choice and you be patient and let it install and that's all it took for me with this torrent... MOST TORRENTS ARE DIFFERENT - Not all torrents would be as easy as this I assure you.
Have any questions I will try to reply :)"
,lira90,2012-08-09T08:30Z,I got it to work!! Thank god :D Im still new at this whole download games thing and this was diff from the other ones. Runs clean man. Really thanks alot :)

,Thatdude23,2012-08-09T19:57Z,I can't find the Install.exe anywhere? A tutorial would help.
,LuvEvol,2012-08-09T21:01Z,It works great.
[T],PirateBoy,2012-08-09T21:06Z,"@ Thatdude23

Follow these steps:
1. Close your antivirus software in case of any false positives (read description for more details).
2. Close any other programs for better extraction.
3. Run Install.exe as administrator (right-click...run as admin).
4. If you can't find install.exe, then extract the first archive to any place [make sure you have enough HDD space] and run the ~unpak~.bat as admin.
5. Follow the instructions on screen.
6. DO NOT STOP/QUIT THE INSTALLATION MID-WAY! It may seem that it's frozen...but its not. Its running the extraction.
7. When all is done, Click FalloutNVLauncher.exe To Play.

Happy gaming :)"

,jpaz790,2012-08-16T08:36Z,alright i ran your installer and it took like an hour and a half to install and then the black box said complete press any button. well nothing popped up for the game after. so i came back on here and it said to click on falloutnvlauncher or whatever but i cant find it? also i cant find where this installed into. i didnt change any settings just clicked next and everything to install. but what i can see is it took up somewhere between 15 to 20 gigs. Can someone help please? i may just be overlooking something simple. Help?
,jpaz790,2012-08-16T08:39Z,"it was simple i found it lol. I thought it would be in my computer than under programs files (x86) like most installs but it was just in my computer and then a ""games"" folder. lol ill test it out thanks"

,fluster84,2012-08-18T21:07Z,"This is how game rips should be, Kaos really outdid themselves. They remind me of the rips by Myth/Skullptura - small size, single click install and all the good stuff intact. 
I got Fallout 3 GOTY, Borderlands GOTY and Fallout NV Ultimate in less than 2 hours. And the best part, all of them are working fine. Thank you, this is going to be an amazing weekend."

,Agandaur,2012-08-24T23:07Z,"I can cofirm that this works, without any problems during installation, i just clicked on install.exe and choose installation directory. Only problem is that it sttuters a little while playing, but that was expectable because this is a rip version and not a full skidrow-like game. "

,LtJohnny117,2012-08-28T08:20Z,"*TO EVERYONE WONDERING ABOUT THIS TORRENT*
this is an unusual torrent. this torrent includes all the DLC, the game, and the developer created this installer. Also the download is ~3.85GB but when it unpack all the compressed folders and files it turns into ~10.2GB. It is weird but it works:  
To install you open the containing folder and run ""install.exe"" and select a folder where to extract (doesn't matter you can always move the files later) during this time it will extract all the zip files, install the game, and then remove the original .zip files **this will take up to 40-60 minutes** MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT INTERRUPT OR CANCEL THE PROGRAM. IT MAY APPEAR FROZEN BUT IT REALLY ISN'T 
after that the program box will say ""complete press any button to continue.""
then open the folder that you selected at the beginning of the install and run ""FalloutNVLauncher.exe""
!!!!THAT IS IT!!!!
-LtJohnny117
P.S. I see comments that say if it has a virus, Trojan, est. If you are downloading torrents and you do NOT have an anti-virus you are a FUCKING moron sooner or later you WILL GET A VIRUS THAT WILL FUCK YOU (it happened to me until I got an anti-virus). get a anti-virus like McAfee or Norton and don't EVER turn off the firewall so then you never have to worry about Trojans or viruses again (what my McAfee does is deleted the file with the virus and leaves the rest of the file alone, i have been through many torrents of programs, games and, movies and have NEVER turned off my firewall)"
,thatsnope,2012-08-29T03:00Z,"Downloaded fine, but after I launch it and hit play it says ""Failed to initialize renderer. Hardware T&L not supported by adapter."" I went into the extras and added to reg entries, but still nothing. Help please?"
,Jdkno,2012-09-03T15:11Z,I have used other torrents from this guy before and they work perfectly but i had a problem with this one i ran the install and it stopped responding so i ran the unpack it seemed to work good but when i run the falloutnv launcher it says fallout new vegas does not appear to be installed and the installer cannot be found. i have no clue what to do from here some help would be appreciated. 
,Jdkno,2012-09-05T18:07Z,"Hey just wanted to let everyone know that i just fixed the ""Falloutnv does not appear to be installed and the installer cannot be found"" error by simply by going to the file my game was unpacked to and double clicking on ""sh3p1"" perfect so far after."
,pollat,2012-09-07T17:21Z,"I ran the install, and after playing I noticed my hard drive was constantly losing memory space (120MB per play). Each time I play it keeps consuming more of my CPU's memory. Also, the hair in my character and NPCs has a bug: if wearing a hat, they get bald or the hair is infront of their face, stuff like that. Other than this it's running great."
,Agandaur,2012-09-10T22:54Z,"  -ATTENTION-

I just finished the game (with all the DLCs) i came back to say that everything works perfect.
If you were thinking about downloading this - you certainly can."
,bloodred125,2012-09-11T07:07Z,isnt it like 18Gb's the full version????

,bubba8998,2012-09-13T19:18Z,"so i downloaded and unpacked using the kaos unpacker let it finish doing its thing it said push any button to continue did that. so i found the game went to run the installer as admin, said fallout is not installed and installer cannot be found try exploring dvd rom and run setup.exe to install game.  idk what to do im pretty new at this and any help is greatly appreciated"

,evan1991,2012-09-16T20:02Z,does its include the dlcs?
,Fluffy283,2012-09-16T21:24Z,"Tried using the installer a minute ago and it said ""An error appeared while unpacking Rar-archive.
--> 12""

Don't know what that means, so I'm going to try the unpack.bat method now. Will write again with results."
,BoxesUnstacked,2012-09-16T21:35Z," This torrent is horrible and I do not recommend it anyone. The way the installer (if you can even really call it that) takes FOREVER, and you would think the time taken would help with the quality - nope. The hair is fucked up and moves to the middle of your scalp, making this weird bald spot. The audio is also EXTREMELY low quality. The last complaint is may have been just me, but half the mods I tried to use did not work. 4/10, just because I could actually play it."
,Fluffy283,2012-09-16T22:52Z,"Tried using the installer and it said ""An error appeared while unpacking Rar-archive.
--> 12""
Tried using WinZip to extract all files from KaS-Fo3nvUE.rar and got another error, something about a CRC.
Tried to Open Unpack.bat and it said something about it couldn't find the path specified. I give up."
,bloodred125,2012-09-18T06:55Z,"@ boxesunstacked.....

not only could you play it, but you could play it for FREE

you could always go pay for it on STEAM and get that high quality audio that you think exists. Try playing Mass effect 3 on High Quality with headphones, you think the audio is bad on this?"
