,beardred,2012-07-30T20:26Z,"i take back my comment, you stopped seeding chk88.

,chk88,2012-07-30T23:35Z,"beardred sorry man,i gotta go to work,i'm seeding again now,i hope you don't delete the torrent"
,BruceWayneJr,2012-07-31T07:01Z,well what the fuck do you wait
,Silverman84,2012-07-31T23:59Z,"I can't die during game play. Tried typing TheMatulaakLives in the console to toggle god mode on and off but nothing. I'm a gamer who likes a challenge, torrent seems pointless to me. Unless someone can help, am I being obtuse?"
,dayday64,2012-08-01T00:47Z,"hello, so i have a question, i downloaded the game without a problem,, it was fast and simple, but when ever i start a new game, i hit the campaign button and the game just closes to the desktop, an i supposed to open it somewhere else other than the desktop icon or something"
,chk88,2012-08-01T04:27Z,"dayday64:try to run the game in compatibility mode windos xp,if that doesn't work,try to reinstall the game,and if that doesn't work either,well i think your computer can't handle the game,i hope this help you to play this awesome game dude"
,chk88,2012-08-01T04:29Z,"Silverman84:that happen to me one time,but it fixed by itself,i think is just a bug of the game but i'm not really sure"
,kriss510,2012-08-07T19:00Z,do I need a CD-R disc for this download?
,chk88,2012-08-07T19:39Z,"kriss510:no dude,no discs [ISO images] are needed to install this game,just unrar and click on the .exe file"
,kriss510,2012-08-07T19:55Z,cool actually AWESOME cause I love this game
,kriss510,2012-08-07T21:58Z,so I just download the game and start playing no more
,chk88,2012-08-08T09:15Z,"kriss510:well you have to install it,but its not complicated,all the instructions are inside,to unrar it'll ask you a passwork,its inside the readme,and then you just have to wait like 5 or 10 minutes for the game to install,and that's it! you can play the game"
,kriss510,2012-08-08T14:54Z,but do I have to download unrar or something like that?
,chk88,2012-08-08T21:58Z,"kriss510:the program you need to decompress a .rar file is called ""Winrar"" just google it,is totally safe,when you have it,and the torrent is complete,go to the downloads folder,that's the default folder for torrents files,and then right click on the three little book with the name of ""star wars republic commando[chk]"" select ""extract here"" an put the password provided in the readme when its all extracted just click on the ""[PC-Full]-SW-Republic.Commando.exe"" and wait for the installation,then you can play the game."
,kriss510,2012-08-08T23:00Z,cool thank you
,kriss510,2012-08-09T19:58Z,but why multiplayer no work
,kriss510,2012-08-11T15:17Z,well you know why
,kriss510,2012-08-11T15:19Z,cause I have finished the story but I can't play in multiplayer and that sucks
,kriss510,2012-08-11T15:20Z,cause I finished the story but I can't play multiplayer }:(
,chk88,2012-08-11T21:47Z,"kriss510:sorry man i didn't check the comments in a while,well probably it's because it's ripped off or it need some kind of patch for the multiplayer just check it on google for a multiplayer patch maybe you can fix it by installing it,i've never liked the multiplayer features in games that's the reason i don't know if its working or not,i wish you luck and hope it does work with a patch"
,kriss510,2012-08-12T02:59Z,ok man will do and thanks ones again for the download best star wars game ever
,scottlive101,2012-08-18T10:31Z,"Great torrent, quick download and works perfectly!

,scottlive101,2012-08-18T10:58Z,"To anyone who has issues with it crashing when you select ""new game"" go into graphics options and turn  the BUMP MAPPING down to low and it should work perfectly!"

,chk88,2012-08-26T23:28Z,"R4FAEL-I-:the password you need to put is ""www.chilewarez.org"" without the quotes"
,HUGESOADfan,2012-09-09T20:11Z,"Hey, haveing a problem here. Ive downloaded alot of torrents in the past and this one seemed pretty straight forward. However when i downloaded this one with you torrent then extracted it with winrar i tried to start it up and it gave me a what software do you want to use to play this game with options such as adobe and itunes and the like. Any suggestions or solutoins "
,chk88,2012-09-10T07:17Z,"HUGESOADfan:I think your problem is that you didn't put the password when unraring the files,that gives you an incomplete set of files with the .bin file extension,if you follow the steps you should have three files,one .exe,the previous two .bat files and a text document,do it all again,unrar and put the password needed its ""www.chilewarez.org"" without the quotes and when you're done extracting just run the .exe file and the game should run flawlessly."
