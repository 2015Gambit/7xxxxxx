,Angertek,2012-07-28T17:51Z,sorry i stopped seeding for a while will seed again  soon
,Angertek,2012-07-29T22:39Z,if you have any problems make sure you run the game first to see if works...
,nafre3,2012-07-31T13:23Z,Can you start seeding again soon?
,nafre3,2012-07-31T13:24Z,Can this be played on LAN?
,Angertek,2012-07-31T14:36Z,"YES IT CAN BE PLAYED lan and sorry yes i just started seeding, my bad..."
,Angertek,2012-07-31T18:56Z,"however no battle.net, just using SC2Allin1 LAN gameplay, you might want to look for updates later on if they release any..."
,nafre3,2012-08-01T09:23Z,Are you sure that you are seeding? Because it is still missing a lot of pieces.
,Angertek,2012-08-01T21:22Z,i stop seeding for like 6 to 7 hours everyday ( out of 24hours) but the rest of the day i seed
,Twissted,2012-08-04T15:58Z,Please Seed!!!
,Angertek,2012-08-05T17:38Z,By the way you can also use http://www.battle4sc2.com/ if you want but i don't think i'll be necessary SCIIALLin is pretty good 
,pizdaire,2012-08-06T01:54Z,This game sucks!
,Angertek,2012-08-06T18:22Z,"@/pizdaire if you don't like Starcraft II go hate somewhere else please. People might understand that the download doesn't work or that there is some sort of problem with it, and there is non, is legit, is good...
And if you have something better please upload it i'll be glad to check it out..."
,Angertek,2012-08-07T16:03Z,"For some reason i do not understand people seem to be stuck in 99.9%. Now all you have to do to fix this ( if you have utorrent) and start seeding is skip the files that are in purple for some reason, is not downloading the files. If you might know why this is happening I'd like to fix it, but as of i know i have no idea. Everything is downloaded and works perfectly, it just never reaches 100% unless you skip...."
,Angertek,2012-08-07T17:11Z,"if you couldn't download some of the files, here they are. but i don't think you really need them.

,SpamAhoy,2012-08-07T21:36Z,How to get LAN to work? LAN tab is grayed out in SC2Allin1 and searching intertubes suggests SC2Allin1 doesn't support LAN.
,Angertek,2012-08-07T23:00Z,OMG thank you Spamahoy now i see the problem. i deleted by mistake the lan content parts before i uploaded the torrent. Thank you so much
,Angertek,2012-08-07T23:27Z,"We'll I'm sorry about that all you have to do is download this Star friend
http://www.naxpgaming.com/download.php?f=StarFriendBeta_1.20_Release.7z 

and follow these instructions

http://www.battle4sc2.com/wiki/index.php/En

Sorry i messed up there, for the heart of the swarm, or the next SC@ releases maybe i'll upload the proper SC2ALLin that has the lan patch...for now starFriend is very good. Again i'm very sorry i got to get better at uploading stuff..."
,linus987,2012-08-15T17:23Z,"Yes i know this is such a lame question but...Downloaded the game, and iv'e extracted the ""missing files"" into the Starcraft 2 Folder...But then what?? xD Follow the intructions you say, what intructions? You need a ""Visual DC driver, and mount the game or what? xD Just clicking on ""StarCraft 2"" doesn't work for me. The game just says ""Launcher connecting to server* and then everything suddenly goes away... >.> "
,geekmole,2012-08-18T16:08Z,"Hey ! Thanks for the torrent, it work good but i have a little problem. I use SC2allin1, it work, i can launch a game, and play but i can't change my race. When i choose to play terran or zerg, the game launch the game good but i'm a protoss. I try to change the map but the problem persist. Do you have a solution ? "
,WraithCross,2012-08-24T09:12Z,"Hey, I'm really confused, your instructions on how to get the lan play to work are really unclear, And honestly I'm confused. Could you elaborate a bit more?"
,Angertek,2012-08-28T22:56Z,there is no LAN game in this version. It was a mistake for me to say that. The only LAN game so far is trough Starfriend and for that you need to go to their site. 
,CatSpawn,2012-09-05T11:38Z,Oh please someone seed for some time?? We are a lot of people with 99.9% completed...
,Angertek,2012-09-06T23:43Z,this is a bad upload. I have said it before. It wont go past 99.9% sorry. 
,Spector13,2012-09-14T17:05Z,DO NOT download stays at 99% and will not work again do not try this torrent waste of time
,Angertek,2012-09-15T02:50Z,I have requested for it to be deleted but it hasn't been deleted yet. I am sorry i can't do more
