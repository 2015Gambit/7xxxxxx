,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-07-29T07:06Z,"""hopefully we can finally see some t&a.""

From Jessica?  Probably not.  The IMDb doesn't mention nudity in this one at all.  If you want to see her naked, you'll have to grab her film Powder Blue.  Unfortunately, she hasn't been naked since. "

,balrog814,2012-07-29T22:20Z,"Crap, ridiculous mistakes. A dog chews the girls leg for 20 min. and she's got minor bruises. but many more there are. The story keeps you guessing until the end, when you realize, what a nonsense it is. Don't waste time with this crap. Biel accepted this? Stupid.

,DaYgon76,2012-07-30T15:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, but your your the only person that uses FMP4 codec for avi. Why???? Doesn't play on dvd player. Might as well be x264. "
,DaYgon76,2012-07-30T15:15Z,Try Xvid like the title says instead of FMP4.
,Funk606,2012-07-30T19:40Z,"@shabarazzz & @kukuras & @gigirvis - Yes If you dont want to DL a movie,go to some shit ass pop up evry 2mins add site,and evry 6mins get the ""Buffering"" icon on screen while u wait for it to buf the next 6 mins it will ""stream"" for u,or u can just spend 10mins DLĂ­ng the hole movie here!!! So STFU with those dickface adds for Pay2View sites,or Signup and get 5 toolsbars sites! We r at Piratbay k we can spend 3-10mins with our 20-100mbit connections to DL a full movie,but we dont want to spend a hole evning sitting and watching the little ring spinning round and round while the movie is ""buffering""!!
