Here on TPB, torrent descriptions can only be edited by begging twice on the forum, once to delete the description and once to remove the hash (torrent's DNA) from the index. What takes less than a minute on other sites takes days here. [sigh]"

Would you please upload Barrons SAT Physics/Chemistry/Biology/Mathematics books?
I need them desperately but have no money!
Please..."
