,Kresho91,2012-08-04T15:15Z,"It works on htc evo 3d. Just wipe ingame data cuzz its somewhere in middle.

When you download put files to SD files android/obb first, than install apk. Turn of wifi or 3g -> go launch the game. It should work.

,jaywrong,2012-08-07T22:41Z,"Your Asphalt 7 upload works perfectly and still works. This worked in the beginning, but now it really isn't, at least on my device (Samsung Galaxy S3) It deletes the SD files and when you re-place it the app still doesn't run. Not sure what's happening your asphalt download has TB restore files and this doesn't that's the only difference I see."
,laskar,2012-08-08T15:34Z,"Could anyone please tell me if the sd data is for verison 1.0.6 or 1.0.5? From everywhere I downloaded, the obb file is main.105 although it says 1.0.6 before downloading. Or is main.105 supposed to work with v.1.0.6? I couldn't get it to work."
,daredev,2012-08-08T18:05Z,"Gameloft blocked the cracked version.
Uninstall it, then set ur device date to 2010, then install and place obb file. But each time before u play u must set ur device date to 2010."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-09T17:27Z,Do what daredev said.When i upload it it worked fine without the date change.Then the gameloft block it.Change the date and have fun with the game.

You must use the no root version mate if your phone isnt rooted.And copy the sd data from this torrent."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-01T03:24Z,"@kdkhh


You follow my instructions exactly?If you had any previous version installed delete it.Install the non root apk for dark knight rises from my other torrent and then copy the data from this torrent to sdcard/android/obb.Without wifi open the game.It must play fine.Then you can open wifi while you play the game."
,kdkhh,2012-09-01T11:49Z,i did exactly.what u wrote.. and still same problem..

@oxominder1

You will download the no root apk from here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7480650/The_Dark_Knight_Rises_v1.0.6_%28No_Need_Root%29_By_bobiras2009

and the sd data from this torrent"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-02T12:33Z,"@kdkhh

Do the following mate:

copy apk and data folder anywhere on your device .(do not put data on obb folder yet )

install apk and now copy ""com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftKRHM"" folder
to android/obb/ folder.

disable automatic time and date .change year to 2010.

run the game

you must change the year before each time you want to play the game and just tick automatic time and date option after playing to return to present

The point that we must carefull is to change the date and the automatic date because due to this the date change automatically and the game gives black screen "
,dighode,2012-09-03T18:01Z,"i have already tried non rooted version
and followed your steps still the game doesn't work
The screen turns black
