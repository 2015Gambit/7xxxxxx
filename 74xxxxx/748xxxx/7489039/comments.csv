,blooooo,2012-07-30T20:49Z,Another mistagged torrent?  Your IMBD link brings me to the IFC film Asylum Blackout.  I searched IMDB for a movie called The Incident but there is only a title listed from 1978.
,blooooo,2012-07-30T20:57Z,"I stand corrected...this movie was released under the alternate title of The Incident, but is widely known as Asylum Blackout.  Thanks for the up."
,blooooo,2012-07-30T20:59Z,"Correction from my last post...the movie Asylum Blackout was released under an alternate title of The Incident...but both are the same movie.  Sorry bout that.  Thanks for the up.
