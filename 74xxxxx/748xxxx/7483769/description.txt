From The New Yorker:

The definition of "downer." Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Leigh star as a pair of sisters; one sings, the other doesn't, although both try to make a living from their voices. The two women start out as opposites and never really shift their ground. On the sidelines stand their respective husbands, Ted Levine and the touching Max Perlich, trying not to get drawn into the grouchy mood. Leigh displays her habitual skills but no longer seems to take any pleasure in them-her banshee wail turns every song into mild torture. The film has plenty of integrity and gallons of rain; it was directed by Ulu Grosbard, whose previous movies, such as "Straight Time," have hardly been bundles of fun, either. -Anthony Lane
