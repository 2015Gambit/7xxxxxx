,SerSpec-V,2012-07-28T17:50Z,@majinsha: If you post any spoilers again you will be reported to suprbay.org and you will not be able to post comments again. 
,hoarymisc,2012-07-28T18:21Z,"Thanks so much footy!  Have you ever considered breaking your F1 videos into three parts instead of two - splitting the post-commentary off the end of the live portion, so those of us who never watch that don't have to download it?  Thanks again!"
,surfboi,2012-07-28T19:06Z,"Thanks,but no seeders have complete file anymore??? 1900 GMT"

,noblsht,2012-07-28T23:18Z,"I did see the one comment also about Mark Webber, and I was a little disappointed, but don't worry about it he didn't give anything away"
,Viciously,2012-07-28T23:45Z,HD?.
,atheist7,2012-07-29T07:39Z,I'm not giving anything away but what possible motive did that idiot have to say what he did?

,pxpierre,2012-07-29T11:54Z,"Thank you footy & seeders. A/V/9

Man I'm glad I did not see that Qualifying intro live. It's full of bullshit graphics animation and they sniffed way too much coke in the cutting room. Thankully one can skip all the crap.

The Qualification (Live) itself is quite good."
,Viciously,2012-07-29T14:47Z,Thanks.
,tegatai,2012-07-29T17:27Z,Many thanks footy.  I *really* appreciate all the F1 torrents :)
,Djurovic333,2012-07-29T17:33Z,hey footy you should have a twitter account! and say there when you upload your torrents! more publicity for you and users would know when you upload :) as for the race when can we expect the torrent?
