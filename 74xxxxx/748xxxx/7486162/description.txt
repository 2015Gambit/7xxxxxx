Two friends having been in and out of bands for well over three years finally asked each other "Why aren't we doing this all ourselves?" With each one being quite a talented song writer in their own regard, fusing together has only created pure MAGIC! This duo now known as Oh, Be Clever recently wrote, recorded and released their first 8 song self titled EP. Pick it up on iTunes, AmazonMP3, CDBaby.com. Oh, Be Clever has played with cool bands like Lights, Rookie Of The Year, Just Surrender, Bowling For Soup, The Brobecks, and The Spill Canvas!

"Oh, Be Clever = Neon Trees + Vanessa Carlton + Linkin Park Check out that formula up there. Interesting threesome, isnΓÇÖt it? It sums up the Utah County duo that makes up Oh, Be CleverΓÇÖs sound. IΓÇÖm pretty sure vocalist Brittney is actually Vanessa Carlton trying to make a comeback, and thatΓÇÖs okay. I admit I enjoy a mainstream pop song from time to time. ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm Not Welcome Here and YouΓÇÖre a MessΓÇ¥ is pure catchy pop at itΓÇÖs bestΓÇöitΓÇÿs a shame it clocks in at just over two minutes. The majority of the EP is jam-packed with power pop chords, heavy Killers-like electro keys and Chester Bennington-esque screams from Brittney. This isnΓÇÖt really a genre I tend to gravitate toward, but IΓÇÖm glad I spent some time listening to this debut EP. ThereΓÇÖs no question Utah County has a neverending supply of talent and Oh, Be Clever is here to remind you of that."
