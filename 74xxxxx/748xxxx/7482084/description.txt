Shevri | 2006 | Critically Acclaimed |  Marathi DVDRip | Phantom

Vidya Barve, is a divorced, working woman,sharing a rented flat with a room mate in Mumbai. Our film deals with one single night which Vidya is forced to spend on the streets of this city.... As she ambles on the deserted roads waiting for morning, she's frightened, lonely, angry, confused. She keeps recalling her relationships as they stand today- Her estranged husband, her teenaged son staying with her mother in small town Nasik, her boss, her colleague, her room mate. Alternating between her encounters during this night and her past, the film finally sees a visibly confident Vidya coming to terms with her lot. And that is when dawn breaks... The title Shevri suggests an insignificant wisp of cotton, which is Vidya. An ordinary woman with ordinary dreams, leading a life which is now out of the ordinary for her. Her coming to terms with her state today and becoming present to her life is what gives an essence to the film.
