Royal Greenwich
In February, the Queen marked her Diamond Jubilee by making Greenwich in south-east London a royal borough. To celebrate the honour, John Sergeant presents a documentary exploring the area's history and looks forward to events over the coming year. His journey takes him on board the clipper Cutty Sark to meet the team giving the famous ship a ┬ú50million facelift, and to the Queen's House, where he finds out how it has been transformed into the backdrop to the Olympic equestrian course
