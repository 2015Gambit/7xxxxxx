,balazs630,2012-09-14T23:58Z,"Worked on my Hackintosh (Intel i7-870, Gigabyte P55-USB3, Gigabyte GTS 450), THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! First unzip with the built in OS X Archive Utility, then drag the Install OS X Mountain Lion.app to Applications.
Unibeast will do the rest....
I could also upgrade it to 10.8.1. It's a much more stable system than the Lion, also faster. I can only recommend it! :)"
