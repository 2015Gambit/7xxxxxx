          thank you."
,shawbaday,2012-07-29T14:37Z,Hows the quality . Pls rate . thats all we want to read ....
,hairybogwoppit,2012-07-29T15:29Z,"quality is absulute crap, plays backwards, upside down and blurry, all out of sink and a complete fuck up, i wouldn't touch this with a road kill.
actually....mmmm it is pretty damn good i was just kidding because shawbaday is a complete wazzock lazy couch bandwidth hog who wont probably share even if he does raise his big fat finger and press magnet. "
,shawbaday,2012-07-29T16:33Z,"screw you hairybogwoppit . 
I had downloaded a dozen torrents of this movie and did'nt find a single good print . So i was just waiting a comment before I download . and BTW I always seed 100% on all my downloads. 
So go sodomize yourself with a retractable baton ( as the piratebay always say). "
,B.Torrents,2012-07-29T17:19Z,Thanks...
,vampzcore,2012-07-29T19:08Z,thanks!!
,Harakiri_,2012-07-29T21:16Z,SHIT!
,wizzard4all,2012-07-29T22:44Z,"I'm with hairybogwoppit. If you don't SEE quality listed, download the fricken movie, watch it, and come back here to post YOUR quality results. You lazy, whining a-holes who expect eveyone esle in the .Torrent community to do everything for you make me vomit! 
Who cares how many copies you've downloaded? They're ALL FREE! TPB doesn't even watch your ratio, so it makes absolutely NO difference! beside the fact, I believe it's just a BS excuse to justify your entitled belief that we should all do your work for you.
I'm willing to bet that shawbaday has someone come to his house and burn the movies to disk, because he's too lazy and stupid to do it himself!
SO, shawbaday, go sodomize YOURSELF with an unretractable baton, this is, if you still have room up there to get it past your HEAD!
GAWD I hate these fricken whiners!!!!!"
,Starpass,2012-07-29T23:17Z,"wizzard4all 
Whining about whiners. That just about takes the cake don't it.
I love the comedy of it though. Top notch boys!!"
,davincci,2012-07-30T01:47Z,"Thanks for the upload. But thanks even more for letting me see the best user name ever....Praise and thanks go out to ""hairybogwoppit""! Man I love that name. You rock!"

@wizzard4all
Burn to disc?
Wire the PC to your display, problem solved.

@ everyone who's wondering about quality:

V: 8 (If you want better, go x264 or >900mb, BluRay rips, etc)
A: 8 (Good!  Even my ears didn't need subtitles as I usually do)
M: 6 (Ehhh, it's a kids movie and just not up to what I wanted after Wallace & Chicken or even the excellent Fantastic Mr Fox!)

It's not a YiFY rip (immaculate x264, usually 1.4gb, I aim for those if I see them) but this looks real nice for XviD and BTW it's Hackulus who may post some pretty raw stuff during Cam periods, but c'mon, this is a 700mb DVDrip.  I knew what it'd look like before I even hit the Magnet.  Your kids will not be disappointed."

,blooooo,2012-07-30T21:15Z,"Hackulus is one of my preferred uppers.  I have you bookmarked with just two others.  Thank you for all the work you do.  I never worry if there is no A-V ratings because I know you only up good files.  But nontheless I will give my rating for those who are unsure....

A - 10
V - 10
M - Pretty funny...worth the dl, especially if you enjoy animated films.

Please never go away, and again thanks so much for your shares.  I appreciate being able to have such a resource to go to.  Cheers M8!"

,janergaard,2012-08-02T16:47Z,"I really don't get why some of you are so scared of downloading something of inferior quality? 

If it is crap, just move on to the next torrent. Those 10 wasted minutes cannot be that important...?"
,mrholmes,2012-08-02T18:12Z,i dont seed anything i download.

,Fritz.,2012-08-03T23:50Z,"@janergaard  some people have data limits on the amount of bandwidth they can use per month.

the thing that always gets me is how arrogant and selfish the people who bitch are.

it would take 2 lines to post the quality for the person who asked, and instead the person will post an entire paragraph to bitch about someone asking for quality.

... and it never even registers to these people that the person asking could very well have a data limit.



I used to play online games with a girl who lived in new zealand. it was quite common for her not to be able to play the last week of every month because she hit her data limit.

the thing is most people are so self centered that if they dont personally have a data limit, then they think that noone else on the face of the planet does either. it doesnt even register to their small minds."
,adie276,2012-08-04T00:05Z,tq..
,janergaard,2012-08-04T00:42Z,"Why does people have data limits? Is it because they live in a country which has such a poor infrastructure that it is necessary, or is it just because they do not pay enough for their subscription?"
,dysphunktion,2012-08-04T06:41Z,"@janergaard
Some internet providers have a monthly download cap, namely cable subscribers. This is usually part of a monthly plan. The cap allows for cheaper internet. It also helps limit speeds on certain areas with high density nodes."
,hairybogwoppit,2012-08-04T20:21Z,"only came to say thnx to h***ulus for the movie. got so wound up with whats is face that i wet myself before posting. sorry for the swear word, i thought they deleted them before going to press. but i have to say one thing seen as i'm on the podium. that mrholmes git, i run utorrent version 2, tell me your ip so i can delete you with my registry should you ever try to leach on my watch"
,Erkle64,2012-08-06T13:22Z,"@janergaard
Yes, in New Zealand we have only recently begun to get some realistic competition in the adsl network, so the infrastructure does suck."
,Tinna_30,2012-08-09T02:36Z,Thanks =]
,ironymon,2012-08-09T16:59Z,"Haha, and when the news caster said lithuania had the best internet infrastructure, fastest speeds and best fibers, i didnt take it for serious, now i see internet is shit everywhere xept lithuania and maybe uk... where pings are the lowest. I feel so bad for australia... they must be still using modems n shit."
,rcsnake,2012-08-15T20:29Z,"Enjoyed this one. I didn't mind the quality, it was good. The movie was funny and entertaining. :-)"
