Video was choppy in WMP but it's a bit better in VLC player. Overall I'd have to say this is very watchable. Thanks to the uploader"
,SCSA420,2012-07-28T10:37Z,FOR YOUR INFORMATION THIS IS NOT SPAM IT IS SIMPLY INFO FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT IT IN HD!!! So If you want the show in 720p do a search for London 2012 Olympics or London Olympics Opening Ceremony 2012 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH

No idiotic announcers and no cutting to commercials every 5 minutes! I didn't watch all of it but just skipped through, so I don't know if anything is missing. Looks just fine to me, a little pixel-y, but what can you do? Certainly much better than the NBC raped version. Audio sounded like it was supposed to. Thanks!"
,libertaswv,2012-07-28T11:17Z,"NBC's commentary was HORRIBLE.

""And here are some more people being featured in the program.... Certainly they will be of significance to the British people....""

Just unbelievable."
,TaiTheGuy,2012-07-28T12:11Z,"@ annadeofasura: Thanks.

I'm done D/L'ing it now & yes, it seems 2 work fine."
,TaiTheGuy,2012-07-28T12:17Z,"Some advice to anyone who wants to download (or upload) any Olympic events/videos:

Searching ThePirateBay for ""Olympic"", returns COMPLETELY different results than searching for ""Olympics"", with an S at the end.

If you're gonna upload, Use the singular with NO S. That's what ""The Olympic Bay"" link, on the home page points to.
P.S. I'll post this on a few different torrents so people maybe start getting in sync."
,jxfrost,2012-07-28T13:16Z,"Just watched this torrent, it is a legit good torrent. "

,haestella,2012-07-28T17:39Z,"Does this include the intro by Benedict Cumberbatch? (I know I can download it separately from YT, but I was just wondering.)"
,kazuban786,2012-07-28T19:26Z,"Please give more trackers, and less leechers with more seeds ... plz..."

,Nav_stranger,2012-07-29T00:19Z,"Guys!..
 This is the best video available in such size PLZ SEED IT (Y)"
,ihtoit,2012-07-29T09:14Z,"I watched this version live, it was amazing - funny bit: Sir Paul fluffing his bit when he started playing out of sync with his backing track. Bits to make you ashamed to be British: Elizabeth Windsor Saxe-Coburg Gotha staring at her fingernails while Team GB went past..."
,ahsankamal,2012-07-29T09:46Z,"what about the audio, if it is working

,AMNetwork,2012-07-29T10:17Z,"Hey Guys I just bought the London 2012 Soundtrack from iTunes and I need you to help me seed this file.

Thanks for you support :D GO TEAM USA!!!!"
,JDWtr707,2012-07-29T11:30Z,Great!  I love this because I don't have to listen to commentators say stupid things and ruin the performance.  Do you have any of the ceremonies from past games without commentary?
