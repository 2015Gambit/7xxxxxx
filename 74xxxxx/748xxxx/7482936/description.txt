This is the first disk of the region 2 version of tour of duty. The disk is untouched and with the original music from the series on tv in the 80s.
I will seeding this till someone have it completed. The upload speed is 80 kb/s so be patient when downloading the dvd.
After Disk 1 is completed i will upload disk2 till disk 5. If someone want to add subs or transcode to mkv (x264) be my quest. My pc is to slow for that at the moment. I added some extra trackers on this torrent so the other one is not working
