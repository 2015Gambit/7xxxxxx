will comment after DL..........


thanks in advance..........."
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-07-31T17:03Z,"@LubiJuice77: BlackBox do smaller releases, by removing all language except English and make their own installer thats havy compressed (thats why it can takes some more minutes to install).
Also, sometimes they can encode videos or sounds.
Like in this release, they have encoded the videos (cutscenes ect. - Not the game, its full) from 1080p to 720p."

like always"
,phat_71,2012-08-02T22:31Z,"First things first, to all the people crying about slow DL speeds, I have 2 things to say. First, STFU cause you're getting something for pretty much free, which means you really have no reason to be complaining. And on top of that, if it's such a problem why not go directly to BlackBox and download from there. I got the bigger version, 7gigs or wtv, with constant 350kbps+ speed.

Now that that's done, on to relevant information. For starters I think this game has some issues. My CPU and Ram are above the max requirements, while my GFX unfortunately is listed in the minimum. Still, all in all I was expecting decent results. And yet the results I got were annoying, and apparently I'm not alone with this problem.

At 1280x1024 resolution with all at max I get around 23-25 FPS, low drops to 18 and high is about 29. I started playing with settings, and saw no real results. So I turned everything to the barest minimum with 640x480 resolution, and what happened? Nothing really..I get the same damn FPS at max as I do at min. Which is completely ridiculous.

And NO, before anybody bothers it has absolutely nothing to do with my hardware or drivers, everything is up to date and everything works perfectly fine. So my only real option is to tough it out and wait for a patch. But the 23-25 FPS so far is pretty playable, with no significant lag, although I have yet to reach any GFX heavy situations so I can't say for sure. Still, I'm mostly just happy it's on PC finally!

For the record, my system is Core 2 Quad 2.6ghz, 5gigs DDR2 ram, and GeForce GT 430 1gb GPU. Even with the new Beta driver nVidia has and the Prototype 2 specific settings, it makes no difference at all. But it won't stop me from enjoying!"
,civoniz,2012-08-02T23:32Z,BlackBox is the shit.. and Stifmeister is the man!

I'm not endorsing Prototype 2 tho... Just to clarify."

,MannUpp,2012-08-03T03:14Z,"Thanks uploader no problems with the torrent.

The game its self is terrible I don't think ive ever been more disappointed with a game before, the details to the environment are ok but thats as good as it gets. textures suck max 500mb in open areas and the performance of the game is horrible, Im on a phenom II 840 with 8gb ram, GTX 560 and I get max 35fps and this is a DX9 game!!

,magister19,2012-08-10T12:55Z,seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed please.....getting a shit speed below 10 kbps
,culvie,2012-08-11T19:34Z,"Im so tired of seeing a million people putting ""SSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDD"" and begging others over the internet to do something. Noone is going to look at ur obnoxious comment and go ""oh i think im going to change my mind because this guy seems to b a real strait shooter."" The comments section is to provide people with feedback about the game and help with any problems they may have. The reason you are downloading and under .5 kbps is because ur internet speed is slow. not because people arent seeding. Get educated before you start pointing fingers at people who are obviously much smarter than you are...

But on a better note thanks to the uploader and all of the cracking teams that make this habit we all have of playing games for free come true :)"
,LubiJuice77,2012-08-12T00:01Z,ok guys i've completed the story it ran flawlessly apart from a few crashes but it has a great auto save so i can say this is an AMAZING torrent thanks Mr.Stifmeister 
,swever826,2012-08-12T08:58Z,hey guys! I'm new here and can somebody tell me what is the difference between Black box and normal version?? Is there another difference than the size of the torrent?? Thanks for any response x)
,LubiJuice77,2012-08-12T15:04Z,"@swever826 dude i asked the same question if you look back in the comments the blackbox version is a smaller but im a dumbass and forgot the technicalities but basically its much smaller but when you mount it then click setup it like unpacks a lot of files, im really not sure why all torrents arn't like this one"
,Lifeshaper,2012-08-12T16:53Z,"I cannot play the game in fullscreen its missing 1-2 cm of the screen, any idéa of what to do? Otherwise it works fine. nice torrent ;)"

 PainkilleR.99 at 2012-08-15 17:21 CET:
I found a solution to the memory leak of Prototype 2 !! if you have ATI Radeon graphic card download a software called Ati Tray tools install it then go to the 3D category you should find ""Flip Queue Size"" and set it to 1, if you have Nvidia then simply go to the control panel look for ""Pre Rendered Frames"" and set it to 1 !! i tried it and it works fine now exept for some loss of FPS but the game is still playable"
,MoD323,2012-08-19T11:45Z,"@ FreeISO - only thing that is outdated is my GPU and I know that, but I saw some gameplays in youtube with Nvidia 9800 GT (and that GPU is little bit slower then mine) but it works pretty much ok without any laggs. How do you explain that. So the game likes Nvidia more then Ati?"
,devlinclark,2012-08-19T20:20Z,this torrent has ripped the extra videos in radnet
,nil_pirate5,2012-08-19T21:15Z,"some1 please help!!

,DracoMagister,2012-08-19T22:41Z,"I seem to have an issue with seeding...
How do i increase my U/L speed? I'm seeding at 12kb/ps and I want to seed faster. Can anyone help?"

 and @culvie 
stop being such an asshole and take your own advice and shut the fuck up, people DO need to seed and its better people asking to seed then some dickhead like u (and me at the moment) talking shit. "
,countryraj,2012-08-30T22:53Z,"Thank you Mr.Stifmeister, works perfect and the game is awesome.Better than prototype 1. If you like Prototype 1, then you gonna love Prototype 2."
