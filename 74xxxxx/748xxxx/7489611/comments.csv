,Petonii,2012-07-31T11:29Z,i love you. i think your going to motivate me in to learning how to make a torrent and share.
,troyl9,2012-08-01T05:51Z,Can you only open this in Element 3d?
,skoxpress,2012-08-01T07:37Z,"You should download it and try it. It's supposed to open in Cinema 4D but mine says ""unknown file format"". It does import into Element."
,almostD,2012-08-01T13:00Z,"probably you need the obj, here is the link to the original model OBJ.

,shitx,2012-08-03T21:08Z,"man I need E3D files for all the element 3d packs, Can you upload them ?? Iâll be very grateful if you do"
,shitx,2012-08-03T21:16Z,"The reason I need them is because I saw that the default ones that come with element 3d such as ""Starter_Pack"" located in ""C:UsersUserDocumentsVideoCopilotModels"" contains both obj and e3d files so models have textures and not white, but I downloaded obj files you uploaded and when I use them they are white, no textures, if you know how to fix this without uploading e3d files, tell me

thanks alot "
,almostD,2012-08-03T23:41Z,"You have to assign material manually, diffuse, specular, normal and occlusion maps. Then you can save your model as a preset.

I will not do all the packages, once in a while, when I need a model I'll map it. Like I did for this model.

I already have uploaded the EMF files for Pro Shaders, will let somebody else cover e3d files for the model packages.

AD"

If the obj file has the textures included, when you import it there will be a texture in the material column. You click on it and get a list in the edit column below the material column. Then open the file with the textures and drag and drop them into the appropriate slots, like ""Diffuse; Specular"", etc. "
,skoxpress,2012-08-04T00:03Z,AD types faster than I do. 
,almostD,2012-08-04T23:28Z,"Haha, you made me laugh!

Come on people, let's share some models.

I have a Suzuki Swift model for Element, a really big model, is anybody interested? Element get relly slow with this one on my pc, hehe."
,skoxpress,2012-08-05T00:54Z,"I'm a glutton for ""free"", I'd like it.

 I have a pretty cool one of the space shuttle...interested?

,skoxpress,2012-08-05T18:51Z,I have a great London Bridge. It's always the same problem. The 3ds files have textures in image form and the obj's have a .mtl file. Ihave no idea what to do with a .mtl. Hard to find a obj with an image for textures.
,skoxpress,2012-08-05T19:22Z,"It's getting too difficult to post here. Even if you drop your proxies it doesn't work.
