This was the first time we had played together! and we managed to record it! a total jam session


Dec 2009 - April 2010

Dec 2009 I found myself living in hampshire again with my auntie who kindly let me stay at her lovely house, the good thing 

about staying there was there were day's we could play music loud! without any problems.

My cousin "Tom Buckingham" had only been playing drums for a few months, yet we quickly came up with some fun songs to play 

and were learning to improvise.

My father who has played in many bands and done a lot of projects over the years joined us to play bass guitar to complete 

this trio! perhaps the bass is not his instrument of choice but it was all good fun!
In april 2010 we abandoned the band but on good terms i left to live with my girlfriend and move to the beautiful north 

country lancashire. Im realy hoping we The "Looney Ginger Boys" create some more music in the future.
We have decided for now atleast to make the recordings below avalible for free !!!
