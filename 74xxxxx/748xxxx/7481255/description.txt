NOTES:

Ok we held fire until we were kindly given the raw files for both video and audio ....and now we can get the best
result we can and saves re-encoding the other xvid releases.
Video need to be straightened up a touch and was so grainy it was untrue ...colours were whacked aswell.
Basically it need some TLC,so fixed it up the best we could.
Audio was nice but had lot of noise to it so had too clean the audio by changing the EQ bands and also used a hiss removal
filter aswell.
Syncing was a pita as the audio wouldn't stretch right like normal but go there in the end by stretching and restretching.

Anyway ....enjoy until better sors come out :)
