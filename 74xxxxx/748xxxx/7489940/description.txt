I inadvertently labled the earlier episodes  as Series 06 when in fact they are Series 05. My sincere apology.																																	This is from the American PBS debut on 7-29-2012.																												

Kevin Whately returns as Inspector Lewis teamed with his cool, cerebral partner Detective Sergeant Hathaway (Laurence Fox). Lewis, the former working-class foil to the erudite Detective Inspector Morse, tackles murder and mayhem with the help of Hathaway.

In the all-new 2012 season, Lewis and Hathaway tackle four cases in the seemingly perfect academic haven of Oxford: The Soul of Genius (July 8), Generation of Vipers (July 15), Fearful Symmetry (July 22) and The Indelible Stain (July 29). Guest stars include Toby Stephens (Jane Eyre), James Fleet (Little Dorrit) and Celia Imrie (Cranford).

Also, don't miss the following encore presentations from Inspector Lewis, Series IV: The Mind Has Mountains (Aug 26) and The Gift of Promise (Sept. 2).
