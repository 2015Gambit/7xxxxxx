,diawkdfi,2012-07-28T18:55Z,Is it better quality than the smaller sized versions here?
,5zigia5,2012-07-28T22:51Z,Can anyone tell me if this is BBC or NBC or...?
,5zigia5,2012-07-28T22:53Z,"Sorry, just saw it's Eurosport. I'll put my glasses on before skimming the description next time. "
,poopyhead69,2012-07-29T07:08Z,"This is the Eurosport feed, and the video is fine but the audio is TERRIBLE, I seriously hope someone got fired for it. Sounds like they had a direct feed of the stadium audio for about 3 seconds and then someone screwed up and turned it off, just leaving a horrible echo-y mess. It's unlistenable, don't bother."
