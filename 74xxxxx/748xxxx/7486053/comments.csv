...  It's a completely senseless tragedy. Furthermore, starving families still exist (although Stella's mother does well to encourage ignoring that), wars continue and isolated tragedies like Unity's go unabated, yet the intertitle states ""all's right with the world"". It turns out, that Stella has only moved from one fairytale to another--she is still oblivious, and the film itself, it seems, is a fairytale just as bogus as the one Stella was originally led to believe.

This is very disappointing work for Frances Marion, who is one of the first important screenwriters in film history. She managed to become, really, the author of Pickford's films; she even directed one of them (""The Love Light"" (1921)). In the end, ""Stella Maris"" is a poorly conceived, contrived, self-contradictory mess with screwy morals; it is a lurid soap opera.
