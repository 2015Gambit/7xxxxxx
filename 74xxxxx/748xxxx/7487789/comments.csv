,xpmule,2012-07-31T18:26Z,"I had this program destroy (corrupt) partitions on me and i started using others and havn't had issues since (many years ago)

I would recommend Raxco Pefect Disk over this, Diskeeper is ugly too lol"
,tr99tr,2012-08-01T18:49Z,after using diskeeper. it removed my audio. had to reinstall audio driver.
,aguy30,2012-08-02T13:06Z,I have used Diskeeeper for about 4 years. Works as configured without any problems. Perhaps the problems other people experienced can be attributed to UM (user malfunction).
,aguy30,2012-08-02T13:10Z,I have used Diskeeper for about 4 years. Works great. Perhaps the other people are experiencing UM (user malfunction).
,MacroFine,2012-08-02T13:46Z,"Works great, thanks. The installation and help files are in Spanish. If anyone prefers English, download & install the official 30-day trial from Condusiv (latest rev. 1016) as I did and this trial resetter will still work."
,jersson,2012-08-06T02:18Z,Works. Thank's. Better than Perfect Disk
,Rush,2012-09-10T23:46Z,"Awesome patch, the new Diskeeper UI 2012 is far better than the 2011 version. Patch will reset trial to 45 days at any time after install..."
,eusoumaiseu,2012-09-11T16:52Z,"It looks like the IntelliWrite fragmentation prevention stops to work after 30 days, even resetting the trial period."
,eusoumaiseu,2012-09-12T01:59Z,"Sorry, the IntelliWrite is fine."
,autastic,2012-09-16T00:50Z,"The patch would be awesomer if it removed the various UI elements that continually tell you it's trialware, allow the user to get straight to the home screen and auto-reset the trial period on every boot.

All things considered, it's good enough."
