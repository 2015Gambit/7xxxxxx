Honda Satnav - West Europe Version 3.60 - 2011 maps and software update with "Windstar" crack.

Unpack using 7Zip

1 - Burn using Imgburn to high quality media. Some reccomend lower burning speed to avoid errors, 8x worked fine for me..
2 - Turn on car (start engine if you like, not needed)
3 - Insert disk into your Honda Satnav unit (verified on 2006 Honda Civic and 2008 CRX, don't know about other models)

Disk will be auto detected by satnav unit and auto-update software. Takes 3-4 mins, do not turn off car during this stage.

That's it :)

Enjoy motoring without getting lost.
