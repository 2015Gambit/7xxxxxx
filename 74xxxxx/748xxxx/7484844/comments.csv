,cartman6666,2012-07-29T11:17Z,"what dlc exactly does this unlock?
isn't this already available in the skidrow unlocked version or is it just the game that's unlocked and the dlc is unavailable?"
,Machine4578,2012-07-29T12:57Z,"@cartman6666

SKIDROW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS GAME!!!! STOP ACTING LIKE A NOOB!!!"

,extr3me97,2012-07-29T20:12Z,it works THX :D
,Jawa8,2012-07-29T23:11Z,this worked well for me but when i completed 5 challenges to unlock the mercer skin it would still be locked. Does the unlocker give access to the skin?
,rguy,2012-07-29T23:41Z,what dlc is there? i have unlocked steam pub hd and iam using fairlight crack. i duno if i wanna dl like 9+ gb for some stupid ass skins or bs. the only one i c that has dlc is that repack skidrow idk but flt fairlight and razr r the top ones that game only had 100 seeds does this unlock ... what? and where can i get xtra dlc for free 
,kshah5124,2012-07-30T00:00Z,"In order to get the Mercer skin you have to complete all 5 challenge sets, not 5 challenges.  Also, this doesn't seem to have all the DLC, I'm missing the extra skins like infected Heller and the armored ones.  The force multipliers are missing too."
,Skitniss,2012-07-30T00:46Z,Virus. Check with virustotal.com
,Trualdiew,2012-07-30T02:28Z,"IT WORKS!! JUST PLACE IT ON THE GAME ROOT FOLDER, THEN EXECUTE IT INSIDE THE FOLDER, THEN GO TO RADNET, AND IT SAYS THAT YOU DONT NEET TO BE CONNECTED TO STEAM!!!! And its not a virus, retards..., maybe virustotal is just crazy, because my antivirus didn't detect anything"
,cheesygrit,2012-07-30T02:55Z,"Does this work only with select versions of the game?

I used Blacklight (4.3 gig one), put the .exe into the game's folder, ran it (got some asian written language pop up), but radnet still asks to connect to steam to get it as a DLC."
,Jawa8,2012-07-30T03:20Z,"@kshah5124

Oh, i didnt see that you could choose different sets, thanks. But yea, it is missing a few skins... Other than that, works great and ill probly just use this until a full dlc pack comes out"
,OmniNegro,2012-07-30T08:37Z,"First thing, just because one stupid virus scanner detects a virus signature, than in no way means there is a virus. Second, just because one does not detect a virus, that in no way means there is not a virus. Third, you should read those first two several hundred times if you do not get it.

Virus scanners look for tiny fragments of code that hash out to a value that is recorded for ease of detection. They are not foolproof. And often, the people who rely upon them prove that by being absolute fools.

I have no idea if this torrent is safe or not. I will not touch it. But please bother to learn a bit and protect yourself by *NOT* being an idiot. Ther is no ""Dummies Guide to not being a Fucking Moron with your PC"" book yet. So pull your heads from your asses and learn."
,Hancock79,2012-07-30T12:59Z,"i just want to say ditto to everything OmniNegro said minus the insults.  I wish everyone was forced somehow to put all that in their uploads description.  this is shit people should have learned after pirating a small amount of games

I ran this file, I can't say it's 100% safe either, but it did do something to the game because it ended up making me press any button before any of the black & white cutscenes would even play and when they would it'd be without sound.  Fairlight release is the one i'm using.  it's just broke for me lol

Scanned PC afterwards, no unusual behavior or files running, so I'd trust it.  Unless virus uploaders are actually taking the time to affect Prototype 2's cutscenes to pass under the radar easier, i wouldn't worry"
,asafmiara,2012-07-30T16:08Z,Jawa8 Listen if you want Alex mercer skin you need to complete ALL 5 EVENTS not 5 Challenges then you unlock the skin. for the other skins and dlc you need to wait before full dlc unlocker comes out
,VegitoDBZ,2012-07-31T15:39Z,blackbox version doesnt work wit this
,Gummiballen,2012-07-31T21:25Z,"Fuck-a-doodel-doo!!

It worked"
,erwin0629,2012-08-01T10:45Z,"it still ask me to connect to steam?
what do i do please help
i got the fairlight version thx in advance :D"
,Jawa8,2012-08-01T15:35Z,"@erwin0629

i dont know about the fairlight version, but i personally downloaded the unlocked version from PublicHD and it works fine on that verion. I hate to say it but.. maybe redownload the game"
,pangunang,2012-08-01T19:17Z,"erwin0629

use fairlight installer on disc 1 then extract dlc to your prototype 2 folder then double click it =)"
,Dufox,2012-08-02T03:43Z,"just to clarify for people wondering.

1. i have the fairlight version of the game and this dlc unlocker worked.

2. it did not mess up my save game (incase u was worried it would)

3. drag the exe to the prototype2 folder (the one with the game.exe)

4. double click the unlocker, a box with chinese symbols will pop up, press ok and it will load a website in your browser. --- this is exactly what the program was intended to do and i can say with certainty this file is legit.

feel free to google how these programs work if you want more proof."
,kuiza123,2012-08-02T05:13Z,does it work for the blackbox version?
,sockery,2012-08-02T09:12Z,how do i know if the dlc is enabled?
,SlappyPwnsAss,2012-08-02T19:28Z,"is there anyway to make this work in the blackbox version? if there is, please tell me :("
,VitorCz,2012-08-05T21:21Z,WORKS GREAT THANK YO MODAFOCKA
,Prototype1994,2012-08-07T20:09Z,"This works great, I have passed the DLC, got the Mercer costume. BUT, my question is, when will the full DLC come out? I just hope it's very soon cause those other costumes are off the hook. Somebody let me know please :( "
,modz4life,2012-08-09T22:47Z,"i have a problem when i select radnet in theďťż menu it says ""keep playing through the story to unlock the menu"" can someone pleassee"
,hisazul,2012-08-16T05:23Z,So which dlc does this unlock exactly.... there are 2 dlc packs: excessive force and colossal mayhem.
,devlinclark,2012-08-16T14:34Z,all @blakbox users this will work just take the proper crack skid
,devlinclark,2012-08-16T14:35Z,and replace it
,hisazul,2012-08-17T04:31Z,So many ppl say it works.... yet NOFUCKINGBODY can say which parts/dlc/etc this unlocks?
,devlinclark,2012-08-17T16:16Z,i think it unlocks both
,hisazul,2012-08-17T20:33Z,"as far as i heard radnet is the only dlc that was included in game. excessive force and colossal mayhem weren't pre-loaded.... then again its what i heard.
still nothing on what it actually unlocks. so im just going to write it off as rubbish."
,hisazul,2012-08-17T20:35Z,"on one lash run thru comments i noticed
 kshah5124 at 2012-07-30 00:00 CET:
In order to get the Mercer skin you have to complete all 5 challenge sets, not 5 challenges. Also, this doesn't seem to have all the DLC, I'm missing the extra skins like infected Heller and the armored ones. The force multipliers are missing too.
so i guess this would imply this doesn't have excessive force and colossal mayhem. just radnet skins."
,devlinclark,2012-08-18T10:39Z,@hisazul i have got the infected heller and the other skins which version do u have
,hisazul,2012-08-18T18:17Z,"@devlinclark i didn't use this. but the only comment about content of this unlocker mentioned not having infected heller or armored skins and force multipliers are absent too.
so that would imply that this lacks the actual fun stuff... could care less about skins.
i want multipliers like chaos creator, showckwave,warp vortex, anti gravity field... and the extra abilities like infinite glide, infected viral launcher, thermabolic boomstick, meduza wrath... and theres infected heller testsubject skin, infantry heller,armored heller, agile armored mercer and zombie mercer."
,Jawa8,2012-08-21T08:35Z,"yea, just to clarify for some people: This does work, but it only unlocks radnet for cracked versions and also gives you access to the alex mercer skin. It doesnt include the colossal mayhem pack, excessive force, or any other skins. Just wanted to inform you of that, and also that i cant wait for someone to actually release the fun stuff"
,devlinclark,2012-08-22T09:40Z,i got the alex mercer costume
