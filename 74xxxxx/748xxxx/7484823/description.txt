TotalFinder adds tabs, hotkeys, and other tweaks to the Mac OS X Finder.


Implemented features:
TABS like in Google Chrome!
Add a dual-panel mode (like in good old Norton Commander)
Make Finder available system-wide on a hot-key (like Visor)
Stop creating .DS_Store litter
Show the folders always on top

Future goals:
Add a better keyboard shortcuts (for keyboard-oriented freaks like me)
Enable a cooperation mode with Terminal.app (for command-line lovers)
Add user friendly MacFUSE support
And what about better git/svn/hg integration?
And more satisfaction!

Requirements
Mac OS X 10.7 or later


What's New
Version 1.3.11:

* Real fix preventing frozen Finder windows under Mountain Lion 



Patch first and then make a key with patch/keymaker
