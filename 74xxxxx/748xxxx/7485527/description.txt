Masterchef Allstars Season 1 Episode 2

All your favourite MasterChef contestants from seasons past, return to the MasterChef kitchen for the first ever MasterChef All Stars.

It wouldnΓÇÖt be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George.

Tonight there is $20,000 up for grabs for our contestants' charities, so it's game on! Competing in four heats, our All Stars must first cook a Lebanese dish. Who will take home the $5,000 heat prize? 

Enjoy!
