The gameplay is very similar to that of the Budokai Tenkaichi series. According to Namco Bandai, players will be able to play solo or team up via "Ad-Hoc" mode to tackle memorable battles in a variety of single player and multiplayer modes, including Dragon Walker, Battle 100, and Survival Mode. Dragon Walker Mode takes fans through the entire Dragon Ball Z story arc from the Saiyan Saga to the Majin Buu Saga. Battle 100 Mode tasks players to relive the most epic encounters and newly created situations from the Dragon Ball Z world in ever increasingly difficult situations. The game will have a possibility to do team attacks. It will feature more than 70 playable and deeply customizable characters, multiple modes, and Ad-Hoc Party gameplay.
