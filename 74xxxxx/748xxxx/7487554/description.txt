BIBINGKA... APOY SA ILALIM, APOY SA IBABAW 2002
Long years of separation have made sisters Loida and Lina strangers to each other. 

So much so that when cruel fate makes their paths cross anew, it is by way of one man's love Willie's. 

As unsuspecting of the two women are, of their familial affinities, Willie gets caught in the what seems a sticky situation. 

Especially as Loida and Lina finally and eventually find the truth about themselves.

Love and life can be as hot and sticky as rice cakes, indeed!
