,highlander888,2012-07-29T18:41Z,Been trying to download since last night. There's about 30 of us sitting here at 0.0%
,Railegh,2012-07-29T18:53Z,"Thanks dude Nice torrent

,arshaad,2012-07-29T19:05Z,Torrent is not working for me. Not enough seeders. 0% since 2 hours now!!
,AMNetwork,2012-07-29T20:59Z,"To those who have downloaded, can you give me  confirmation that you were able to download the file successfully. 

Thanks for your support, 
AMNetwork "
,decym80,2012-07-29T21:22Z,Thank you! :)
,albuswren,2012-07-29T22:42Z,"Have been dwnloading this since 24 hrs... still stuck at 0 along with 30 peers (all stuck at 0%) and 0 seeds..
AMNetwork, have u uploaded it entirely?
at least 1 seed will be necessary to make this torrent work..."
,CubUK17,2012-07-30T02:10Z,"Been trying to download this for the best part of a day, hasn't downloaded a single byte!!  Showing 0 seeds, 0 availability!

Whats going on?!"
,spellshocked,2012-07-30T02:58Z,seems like a fake torrent since nobody has anything more than 0% so if you can provide other means than remove your torrent.
,kdallas2010,2012-07-30T04:21Z,"Agreed, I don't know how it is done but it seems to be an empty file.  Perhaps some hash trickery that tells the client it has 301MB to download, when in fact it is empty?  I can imagine that this would be a useful way to gauge interest for a marketing company... just looking at the 2000+ peers alone, at any one time."
,tofushoyu,2012-07-30T05:36Z,Thanks!
,AMNetwork,2012-07-30T07:23Z,@spellshocked; This torrent isn't fake. I have the album on my HD. But I having trouble trying to get this damn thing to seed all the way. I will attempt to re-seed this torrent correctly in a few mins. 
,AMNetwork,2012-07-30T09:21Z,"Damn! Forget it! I'll upload this to BayFiles instead. 

Link: http://bayfiles.com/file/ixbt/6dzXsa/AMN.Exclusive.Isles.Of.Wonder.2012.zip"
,albuswren,2012-07-30T10:55Z,Thanx a lot... ur bayfiles link helped me to get it at last...
,AMNetwork,2012-07-30T11:15Z,"@albuswre; Your'e Welcome :D.. I never ran into a problem until now.. But I'm glad you were able to download it. 

-AMNetwork"
,spellshocked,2012-07-30T13:06Z,Well its fine for you to claim you have it on your HD that means nothing to us who have been sitting here at 0% with no seeders to connect to and nobody in the list with anything more than 0% downloaded.  Also why do you bother zipping mp3 files up?  Its completely pointless and immediately raises suspicions on its on which is why I pointed out it might be fake.  Regardless the torrent is still 0 with 0 seeders with 0 downloaded so you might as well just delete it.  Downloaded from the other guy who does not have it zipped up at 3MB a second so it is all good regardless.
,spellshocked,2012-07-30T13:08Z,"here is a proper torrent with mp3 files and the digital book.

,J_Darnley,2012-07-30T19:05Z,"I'm not surprised that people can't get this torrent to work.  The file you have put on bayfiles does not match the content that the torrent expects.  Not a single piece matches.

Another thing, the audio is not lossless.  It is just AAC."
,cyberkeg,2012-08-02T07:53Z,"Thanks amnetwork.  After reading the confusion in the comments, i did not try tpb download but went direct to the bayfiles link that amnetwork posted and downloaded perfectly and pretty quickly.
For those who care, they are .m4a format with vba of 261-292kbps.  No complaints. Tnx again."
