first you need to upgrade video card to new one (nVidia 7300GT won't work)
then you need to edit installation disk
and use Chameleon 64-bit Bootloader to pass 32-bit EFI

About MacBook... you can forget about 10.8 on it.

Sorry for my English"

""i find it not be iso format""
and what convinced you to this conclusion?

""But will you be able to make the Installation Disk for all of us ""oldies"" Mac-users?""
I tried. But after build number 12A128p (ML 10.8 DP1), Apple completely rewrote mach_kernel to 64-bit architecture, without support to boot with 32-bit drivers. Since 32-bit drivers for Intel GMA 950 and GMA X3100 does not exist, so accordingly we can not install ML 10.8 on mac book or mac mini with these graphics cards.
In the end there is only one machine that can work with ML 10.8 - Mac Pro 1,1 (with newer video card)

Sorry, time to buy the new Mac... has come :("

*2008 Aluminum Macbook works fine*

Thanks cap!
Do you ever read what others write?
*can not install ML 10.8 on mac book or mac mini WITH THESE GRAPHICS CARDS.*
In case you do not know, the MacBook (13-inch, Aluminum, Late 2008) had a graphic card NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and of course it support ML 10.8. All MacBooks that was released before can't boot ML 10.8 because they have GMA 950 or GMA X3100 graphics card"

Please show me where you found the DDA format? (show me screenshot)
I do not understand how you can download the ISO file, and finally get the DDA file? Nonsense! I think you just mixed up image files. Find my file and just burn it with Nero Burning ROM!!!
That all!"
