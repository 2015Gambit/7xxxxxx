The game begins with protagonist Jimmy Hopkins, a juvenile delinquent with a history of being expelled by seven schools he's attended, being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a boarding school in the fictional town of Bullworth by his neglectful mother and most recent stepfather. Two kids named Pete and Gary become his friends and show him around. But Gary, who wants to rule the school, betrays him by tricking him and the biggest and strongest student into a fight (which Jimmy wins). Gary betrays him because Gary thinks Jimmy wants to rule the school as well.
