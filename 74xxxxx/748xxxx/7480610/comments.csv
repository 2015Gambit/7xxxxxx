,laskar,2012-08-08T14:17Z,"Thanks a lot..this works! But it didn't work at first following the instructions. My phone is Sony Xperia S. After installing the apk and copying the obb folder, I ran the game with internet connection on and it just stayed on that chinese splashscreen loading interface. Tried it several times before I gave up. Then I unistalled the game. This is what I did to get it to work:
1. Install the apk and run it (without obb folder and without net connection). It loads fine and asks if I want to download addtional data by wifi. Tap exit.
2. A folder ending with A7HM will be created inside obb folder. Inside that a .nomedia file will be created. Don't bother with that. Just copy all the sd contents inside here. Exit your file manager.
3. Running the game now works! (You don't need internet connection to varify license at any stage...at least I didn't.)"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-08T14:47Z,"@laskar

This is my instructions mate.I just dont say to run the game without obb file.Install copy obb file and if deleted(if) then copy obb file again and the run it will work fine.

For all the asphalt fans if you want to add me my name in asphalt 7 is bobiras2009.Lets racing."
,laskar,2012-08-08T15:11Z,"But my game hanged when I turned on internet connection to varify license. Tried several times, installing and reinstalling. Finally worked with internet connection off and not varifying license. Once it runs for the 1st time, there is no problem if I turn on internet connection later.
Have been playing it...great game!"
,lerijiso,2012-08-14T09:46Z,Works fine. Thanx man
,NarutoNamikaze,2012-08-18T07:50Z,"@ bobiras22, @ laskar

I have a non rooted Galaxy S I9003. My internal memory is 4 GB which is divided into phone memory of 1.7 GB which is inaccessible, and an internal SD memory which is 1.52 GB. I have an external SD card of 16 GB.

When I installed this apk, it got installed in the phone memory and files appeared in the Internal SD memory. But I don't have any space in those. I want it to be installed into the external SD card. When I moved the app to USB memory in the Manage Apps, I think it was moved to the same Internal SD memory.

I still made an Android folder in the External Memory card and pasted the files there. But still it doesn't start like it does for laskar. After the gameloft screen, it checks licence and crashes

Please tell the instructions for installing this (I don't have Titanium backup, is it for rooted phones only?) possibly to the external SD memory."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-21T13:10Z,"@NarutoNamikaze

Make the default install for apks in your sd card.Then install the apk and follow my instructions.The sd data from my other torrent put it where i write in your external sd card.One time it will craches.Second it will play.Just follow exactly my instructions."

plz help me "
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-26T21:42Z,"@troll17

For root check the xda forum for your device.Its only 4 minutes.

@tej911

Unroot version plays only offline.Rooted version play online too.

@viraj31

First your phone isnt rooted right?Then you download the unrooted version.If you have the unrooted version and copy the sd data from my other torrent then you must never open wifi when you play asphalt 7.It will corrupt the license.

The instructions are in the txt in the other torrent.If you follow it exactly(install unrooted apk,open it once then FC,then copy the sd data to sdcard/android/obb(if not an obb folder create one).Then run the game.If it gives black screen or repeat the gameloft screen the obb file deleted.Copy it again in the obb folder.Run the game without wifi.It must plays fine 100% with this way."
,viraj31,2012-08-27T19:27Z,"@bobiras2009 done exactly what u have mentioned several times dosnt working i m just loosing hope
is there any other way out plz tell me... thanks"
,viraj31,2012-08-27T19:44Z,"it just wait on ""checking license"" for few seconds and tells me to retry or cancel.retry keeps retrying while cancel quits the game what to do?
here all other are saying its working on them then why not mine
remember my wifi is off during this all and i have copied the com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA7HM folder which contains 14 files OF 1.36 GB naming imgiab7119.bin etc and at last a file named main.100.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA7HM of 1.3gb alone to (inbuilt mem)sdcard/android/obb/
i have tried this around 7 times by uninstalling again n again it only keep retrying checking licence "
,vineet_allstar,2012-08-28T07:56Z,Working for me thanks! (y)
,viraj31,2012-08-28T20:57Z,And can u upload oxford english dictionary? 
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-29T19:26Z,"@viraj31

I have uploaded mate.

For asphalt 7.The steps are:

install the apk.run it and it will close.now copy the sd data from my other torrent in the sdcard/android/obb.Now run it again.If the obb file deleted copy it again.run it again it must play fine.After that you can open wifi and play the game online too"
,viraj31,2012-08-29T20:42Z,"But what about the license check after copying the obb file and other data it isn't force close, the game is running but require licence check what to do I have tried change in phone date to 2010 but now also it require license is there any other way
Thanks for your reply"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-30T03:46Z,"@viraj31

After copy the obb file for second time with wifi off you will open the game.It must plays fine this last time.Only the first time it will loop in gameloft screen but you will close it pressed the home button.I cant understand what you doing wrong i have install it in 10+ phones with my way i have in txt and in all worked fine."
