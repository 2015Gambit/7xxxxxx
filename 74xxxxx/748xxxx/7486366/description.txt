U.S. Go Home (Claire Denis, 1994)

With the screenplay written by Anne Wiazemsky and Denis herself and with an impeccable soundtrack, this is Claire Denis' contribution to "Tous les garçons et les filles de leur âge", in which nine directors were each commissioned to make a film about their adolescence.

Set in the late 60s, on the perimeters of an American army base somewhere outside Paris, it finds 15-year-old Martine (Alice Houri) struggling to come of age, having just learned that her best friend, Marlene, has recently lost her virginity—a distinction that threatens the two girls’ relationship. As Marlene attempts to ‘catch up’ over the course of one long and confusing night, Denis delivers an uncondescending and utterly convincing depiction of teenage longing, rendering her heroine’s misadventures with compassion and genuine insight.
