,OmniNegro,2012-07-07T11:00Z,"I do not know Japanese, but there is a clear and obvious 6 in the image you put for this when you made the torrent.

This is your first torrent here on this username, and the files list has this:
DNW7 Crack/DNW7 Crack/SM6.exe

Sounds fake to me. But I do not know or care enough to try.

Use cation people. This may not be legit."

,Aoishiro,2012-07-07T13:22Z,"i think it's real since i had the pirated hard copy.

dynasty warrior 7 is the english title, the japanese one is called shin sangoku musou 6 with musouden. it's the same thing. 

koei did not release english pc version of DW7. they only release the japanese version.
