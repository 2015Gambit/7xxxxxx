Doesn't work for this custom launcher.
Had to download another file called Marto Minecraft Launcher (minecraftMA.jar)."
,wesleyman000,2012-07-10T10:57Z,@ehanol Yea i thought it might not work. Sorry i couldn't help :P
,ROBOTECH3000,2012-07-10T22:45Z,Great torrent brosky ! ;'D but does multiplayer actually work?? or do you need hamachi?
,wesleyman000,2012-07-11T01:55Z,@ROBOTECH3000 You need hamachi unless the server owners port forward it. A lot of people are too lazy to do it.
,BZant,2012-08-02T03:00Z,Wow!!!!!!! Thank you so much. I purchased this game a couple days ago and been trying to get my friend to but he wont. Since i found this now he will play with me! And YES this totally works everyone. I personally tried 2 servers. You must have online-mode=true changed to false. It disables the sign in check. So any pirated version can play with you. Thanks again for awesome torrent.
,BZant,2012-08-02T03:01Z,And if anyone didnt understand what they needed to look at (file wise to change the online mode) its in your server folder. The file is called server properties. Open it in notepad.
