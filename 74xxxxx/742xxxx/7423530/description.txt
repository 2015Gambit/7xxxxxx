Whale Wars: Viking Shores
Every year, the people of the Faroe Islands herd pilot whales to their shallow shores and kill them for their meat. Whale Wars: Viking Shores follows the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as it sets sail to end this ancient tradition known as "The Grind."



2)  Battle Cry 
The Brigitte Bardot and a covert land team continue to patrol the shores of the Faroe Islands for signs of whale hunting. At one location, the crew discovers what they thought are fresh whale bones scattering on the sea bed, which would indicate that whaling has already began. Meanwhile, the Steve Irwin cannot leave Scotland until a bond is paid, forcing Paul Watson to embark on a fundraising campaign. Eventually, the bond is paid and the ship is allowed to leave. The Sea Shepherds receive news that there is an arrest warrant for Watson, but Watson decides to head for the Faroes anyway. Upon arrival, however, Watson is not arrested.
