America Rebuilds (2002)

83 min. NTSC dvd from vhs plus extra 3-minute intro.

This is the infamous PBS video that includes Larry 'Judas' Silverstein's full confession.  He brazenly gloats that the building was demolished, or "pulled", only to deny that it meant to demolish.  He says the first thing he thought of when the building went down, was "We should replicate what was there", only to tell a TV interviewer, only 9 days after the event, on September 20th, that he thought of the 5,000 (as yet uncounted) people and their families first, but that "We should rebuild".  Complete with mayor Rudy Giu signing suckers' helmets, whilst wearing a Salvation Army smock, and plenty of grieving 9/11 victims' family members. Footage of WTC 6/7 being pulled, and plenty more.

"A pile of pixie-sticks", "A house of cards".
