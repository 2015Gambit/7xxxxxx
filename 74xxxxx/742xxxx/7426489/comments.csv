,murph05,2012-07-24T00:35Z,Thank you very much!
,Codai,2012-08-05T18:50Z,Finally! Thank you! Could I ask you to post any new versions you can here? Its very hard to get a hold of Skyrim (or anything besides Call of Duty and GTA) in my country and I'd like to at least contribute to the community until I can actually get the game. Will seed as long as I can.
,Durrkman,2012-08-07T14:19Z,@Codai Sure
,MaryseDynasty,2012-08-09T13:50Z,Does anyone have a link to a version working with patch 1.7.0.9?
,Durrkman,2012-08-09T18:00Z,I'm trying to get that version up here if you want it now i'm pretty sure its up on Demonoid
,MaryseDynasty,2012-08-10T05:18Z,Hasn't Demonoid been shutdown by Ukraine Authorities?
,Durrkman,2012-08-11T06:35Z,Wow i didn't know that thats a shame
,MaryseDynasty,2012-08-11T07:44Z,Sadly it's true...So it would be much appreciated if you could get it on here as soon as you can :)
