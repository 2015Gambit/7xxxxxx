Acting on a tip that a hunt is underway in Vestmanna, both the Sea Shepherd ships and the land team rush to the site to try and intervene, only to find the cove empty and the town deserted. It is then learned that the residents of the town have traveled to the capital city to partake in the annual festival of Ólavsøka. Paul Watson has the land team head to the festival with graphic images of slaughtered pilot whales on their van; they are eventually forced to leave the festival by local authorities. Later on the Brigitte Bardot docks in Tórshavn harbor where they are harassed by locals throughout the night, culminating in one resident attempting to cast off the ship's mooring lines the following morning.
