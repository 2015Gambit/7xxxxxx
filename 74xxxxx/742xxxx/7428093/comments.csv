Everything from region locks to date delays for no good reason"

[T],despo1ler,2012-07-17T23:36Z,"I'm afraid there are not any 720 copies of ben 10 UA, the iTunes releases of it were only in SD and the only TV rips are again all SD, sorry.
As for scooby doo MI season 2, so far only 5 episodes have aired on the channel Boomerang in the UK and I think they were leaked by mistake as they stopped airing them after the 1st 5 and haven't aired any more since, there will not be any 720p web dls of it until it has aired in the US and when episode 6 will become available in any format is a mystery to me..."

,AmartyaSk,2012-07-22T10:01Z,"@despo1ler Thanks for the response
Sad about Ben 10 ,
but as stated ""the episodes of Scooby Doo MI S02 would begin airing on Cartoon Network in May 2012 but was set back to July 30, 2012 in the United States.

Hope these Episodes be Aired Soon.

You Are Doing a Great Job .Thanks"
