Tucker MaxΓÇÖs third and final book in his series of stories about his drunken debauchery and ridiculous antics. What began as a simple sentence on an obscure website, ΓÇ£My name is Tucker Max, and I am an asshole,ΓÇ¥ and developed into two infamously genre-defining books, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell and Assholes Finish First, ends here.

But as you should expect from Tucker by now, he is going out with a bangΓÇöliterally and figuratively. In this book, youΓÇÖll learn:

* How to live and work in Cancun, while still enrolled in Law School,

* Why Halloween is really awesome,

* How to subtly torture a highstrung roommate until he explodes with furious anger over a misplaced condiment,

* What really happened when a dirty pageant girl tried to sue Tucker because he told the truth,

* Why you should never accept a homemade treat from a hippie with a van, and

* What happens when Tucker turns sexting into a sport.

HeΓÇÖs still Tucker Max, andΓÇöfor one more bookΓÇöheΓÇÖs still an asshole.
