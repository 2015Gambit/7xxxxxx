,lif3isfr33,2012-08-11T02:59Z,"Serial no longer works guys just a heads up. As of August, AVG been stomping down on us pirates. Don't believe me, go ahead and download it and see for yourself. Unless your using this offline 100% of the time your good. But if you tend to be online and need protection, look somewhere else or wait until some hacker cracks it. Sad day for AVG pirates. "

,spikedbebop,2012-08-25T12:20Z,"Installed and working fine for a few days now. I've been checking throughout that time, and it still has the Feb 2018 exp date.
Dunno why others are having problems. Did you all remember to uncheck the option to ""help the community"" or whatever by sharing your info?"
