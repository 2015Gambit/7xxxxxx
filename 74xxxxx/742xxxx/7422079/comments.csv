Are you serious?, here is the scan report

/1341862609/

and the 3 detections are FALSE POSITIVE. All my torrents are 100% CLEAN.

I dont know how you can tell that something like that is not in wallpapers...this torrent is Animated Wallpaper and not images files like .jpg, .bmp, .png, etc. and if you have not noticed i'm Trusted user status, this status is not given infecting users."
