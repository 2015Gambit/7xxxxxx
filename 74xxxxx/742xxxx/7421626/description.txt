Twilight Eyes

They are out there.

Waiting. Watching. Unseen by normal eyes, but all too visible to Slim MacKenzie, a young man blessed - or cursed - by Twilight EyesΓÇª

They are out there lurking in the darkest shadows of an eerie, moonlit carnival. Feeding their twisted needs with human suffering. And fiendishly plotting the downfall of the human raceΓÇª

They are out there But do not scream.

They will hear you.
