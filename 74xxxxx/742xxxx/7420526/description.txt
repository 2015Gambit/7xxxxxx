Synopsis:

Sustainability is the integrating theme of this current and thought-provoking book. SUSTAINING THE EARTH provides the basic scientific tools for understanding and thinking critically about the environmental problems we face. About half the price of other environmental science texts, this 14-chapter, one-color core book offers an integrated approach that emphasizes how environmental and resource problems and solutions are related. The concept-centered approach transforms complex environmental topics and issues into key concepts that you will understand and remember. By framing the concepts with goals for more sustainable lifestyles and human communities, you will see how promising the future can be.
