 The Complete Guide to Gazebos & Arbors shows basic techniques for building sheltering structures in the landscape, and provides complete project plans and directions for more than 12 versatile, flexible architectural projects. 

 An overhead arbor can turn a patio or deck into a cool oasis from which to enjoy a landscape, while a gazebo can serve as a full-fledged outdoor room with protective walls, ceilings, and even electrical service. Every reader will find this book to be an indispensable source of planning, design, and practical how-to information.
