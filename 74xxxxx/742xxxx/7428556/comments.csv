,rhflem12345,2012-07-11T01:17Z,You need to learn how to seed!
,ShadowNoir,2012-07-11T07:07Z,"I have 1mbps internet speed,I am seeding with the whole 1mbps just for this file
and until somebody downloads the whole 60 gigs (which at best can take a day with my speed) the download can't become faster
so how about you get off my back and if you don't like it you can search for it elsewhere
okay rhflem12345?
stupid little seed popper :) "

thanks for uploading this holy grail collection. 
you have some of jimmy cagney's hard to find films.

BTW, can i make a request?"
,ShadowNoir,2012-07-15T13:07Z,"you're very welcome,I too know how hard they are to find
tell me and I'll see if we can work it out :)"
,serena101,2012-07-15T14:17Z,"shadownoir,

um, ive really been looking forward to watch all james cagney films. 

is it okay if you upload ""The Doorway To Hell"" in DVD-R? i'd be delighted to see it :))"
,ShadowNoir,2012-07-15T14:38Z,"what do you mean by DVD-R
the DVD-R quality or do you want me to burn it as one? because it wont improve the quality
however,the movie already is in the torrent
if you know how to make DVD-R's maybe you can try ? :)

an alternative is maybe this link;
