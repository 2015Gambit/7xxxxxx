,Sphenisciphile,2012-08-11T06:46Z,"@Jazzdancer - I hope you got it all. I do periodically check if an older torrent needs re-seeding (especially for something as obscure as this). As with everything else I've uploaded, thanks also to my local Public Libraries for having such ecclectic DVD collections. We do love British TV here (in my part of Canada anyway).

Requests? Well, either a PM on Suprbay (user ""Penguin-Lover"") or post a note on my most recent upload and I'll see it. No guarantees as to whether I'll be able to get it though. I'm working on several series at the moment (Taggart, Jonathan Creek, Waiting for God, Sapphire and Steel, to name a few).

Thanks anyway for the words of encouragment."
