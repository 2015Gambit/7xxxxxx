The license will run out after 30 days...
But that is kinda no problem, I have been without the license on my windows for 2-3 months now, only different is that my desktop background gets deleted every hour or so..

But if you want the license you can allways check out this site: http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information"

also you can get every version official un-modified from anyone at fast direct download links pretty easily..
