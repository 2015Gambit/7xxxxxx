About 30% of all FDA-approved drugs are derived from botanical sources. Examples include aspirin (from willow bark) and digoxin (from the foxglove plant). Molecular biology has allowed for more directed drug development. For instance, the active ingredient in a plant extract can be identified, isolated, and replicated. The molecule can also be modified to add desired effects or eliminate undesired effects. Sometimes molecules are altered in order to develop a drug just different enough from the old medication to allow a new patent to be issued. ""Reverse"" development is also done, where a receptor in the body is identified, and computers assist in identifying molecules to fit these receptors. In sum, many modern medicines started as plant extracts and were refined to improve the medicinal characteristics, including reducing toxicity.

Currently, approximately 12-25% of Americans use an herbal remedy yearly. Despite their popularity, these substances, advertised as medically active, are regulated as dietary supplements, rather than as medicines, by the FDA. This means that there is very little regulation of the manufacturing or content of these substances. In Canada every natural product must apply for a natural product number (NPN) and is now governed under the Natural Health Product Regulations, which include provisions on adverse reaction reporting, labeling, and site and product licencing.

Americans, however, often perceive herbals as ""safer"", ""more natural"", and ""more holistic"" than conventional medications. Also, many are suspicious of the profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry. Herbal medications do, of course, represent an enormous financial interest. Echinacea alone has annual sales of about $300 million in the U.S."

Many studies have been done of herbal medications. Unfortunately they often lack good documentation, quality, and suffer from not having analyzed the substance studied.[7][8] Because of the lack of quality control and regulation, it is difficult to assess what the effect of many herbs is, or even what people may be taking, given the label often fails to match the content.

Given these limitations, a summary of studies of some popular supplements is listed below:[9]

        Milk Thistle seems to have proven results in reducing liver inflammation in children undergoing chemotherapy[10][11]
        Ginkgo is sold as a ""memory aid"" and a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Studies show mixed results, with a possibility of it being better than placebo
        Saw palmetto: marketed as a treatment for benign prostate disease in men, studies show some effect greater than placebo, at least in the short term
        St. John's Wort: used for depression, data show short-term efficacy over placebo for mild to moderate depression.
        Ginseng: many different types, insufficient data
        Echinacea: marketed for the common cold, no good, consistent studies have been done.
        Evening primrose oil: for PMS, studies show no benefit
        Ginger: insufficient data, though used as a classic stomach ache cure.
        Garlic: insufficient data, claimed to help with heart health. If nothing else, it will repel vampires.
        Kava-Kava (or just Kava): marketed for anxiety, some improvement over placebo, side effects
        Valerian root: for insomnia: does nothing[12]
        Cranberry juice: for prevention of Urinary Tract Infections: well demonstrated and well documented efficacy[13][14]
        Rose Hips: Good for getting an extra dose of Vitamin C, but unproven for anything else.

[edit] Potential harms

Much of the time, herbal remedies are used without consulting a physician about the condition in question. This may lead to delay or failure of diagnosis of important medical conditions. For example, a man who takes saw palmetto for his urinary problems may have all the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, but if he feels better after taking the saw palmetto, he may not be diagnosed until it is too advanced for treatment. Herbs can also interfere with conventional medications.

As herbs have become more popular, and as more have become available with globalization, more toxic effects are being seen. Herbal preparations may or may not resemble the traditional cure from which it was derived, and are often used in a different context. For instance, small amounts of Mahuang may exist in certain Chinese medicines, but is used in much higher concentrations in the West. Many common herbs can be quite toxic, and may exist in supplements without clear labeling. For example, Mahuang can cause serious cardiac disturbances and Kava can injure the liver. New reports come out regularly about liver failure caused by herbal remedies. Herbal remedies from outside the U.S. are sometimes contaminated with lead and other heavy metals.

Many herbal medicines can interfere with traditional medications. For example, St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 System. This can increase the rate at which the liver metabolizes drugs, leading to a dangerously low level of drug in the body."
