,Branislav-BGD,2012-07-26T20:49Z,"The installation instructions are rather confusing due to bad English grades in school OR the use of Google translate.
However, I hope this installation won't cause my explorer.exe to stop working shortly after the installation like it happened with that other CS6 I found on another torrent. :"
,JnPol,2012-07-30T08:23Z,"Why there's a folder ""crack"" and one ""backup""? Appreciate the torent but is the hardest installation ever xD
Anyway its working fine, Thanks."
