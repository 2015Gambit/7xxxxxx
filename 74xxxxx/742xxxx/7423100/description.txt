Par Avion.

Released: June 16, 2009
Label(s): Independent

After releasing their first independent EP, Par Avion, back in 2009, High Flight Society has again resurfaced. This time, the rock group is back with a six-song EP, Lights Come Down. The Georgia natives take a different approach on the EP with a less aggressive rock project that feels like a big change of pace from the band's self-titled debut.
