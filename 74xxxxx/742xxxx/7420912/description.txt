The First Series was the Image limited series (which was uploaded in another torrent)

This torrent includes the second, third and forth storylines

Second Series: Paradise Lost

Furthers the Lion Voltron saga as well as introduces the Vehicle Voltron team. At first the two Voltron teams are at odds and there's some great Voltron vs. Voltron battle action.


Third Series: War Path

This arc concerns a betrayal to the Lion Voltron team as well as how the Voltron Force edges closer to all-out war with the Drules. Vehicle Team is only mildly a part of this arc.


Fourth Series

Actually, the below issue, #11, was issued and it was announced that it would be the last - so the arc ends prematurely I'm afraid.
