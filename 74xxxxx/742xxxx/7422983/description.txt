Re-enabled character customization. (No character sprite atm though)

Fixed a few weapons that have issues.

Added frying pan as weapon properly. (no special sound yet can't seem to find a free one)

Fixed bug that meant some weapons never have a 'hit' frame and thus never hit zombies.

Planks stack once more.

Add 1366x768, 1920x1200 and 2560x1440 resolutions
Fixed issue with clip reloading. Remember HOLD R to load bullets, let go to put clip back in.

Fixed death anim.

Lowered initial zombie count. Still plenty though! Feedback welcome (It's hard since half want lots, half don't )

Fixed tree/door chopping.

Fixed hordes appearing indoors.
