Documentary telling the story of Ozzy Osbourne's torturous and emotionally fraught journey 
to sobriety, which the iconic musician regards as his greatest accomplishment. Featuring 
interviews with Ozzy's brothers and sisters, as well as Jack, Sharon, Aimee and Kelly 
Osbourne. Featuring never-seen-before footage uncovered from the archives and interviews 
with Sir Paul McCartney, Tommy Lee, Henry Rollins and others.

Ozzy Osbourne's four-decade track record as a culturally relevant musical artist is 
unprecedented, but his personal struggles have been shrouded in myth and secrecy. In some 
ways, Ozzy's fame stems from his prodigious drug and alcohol intake, his musical 
accomplishments overshadowed by his 'madman' persona.
