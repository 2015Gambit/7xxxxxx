I had uploaded with the original ripper's name in Kickass Torrent, here it got copied and so my name is out up!

Sorry, DevriZ!

This won't happen again!

Also, the torrent file was not downloaded from any web site, it was shared by someone in in a WAP site!

Sorry for everything!

DevriZ's upload! m/"
[H],tykoon123,2012-07-09T18:32Z,"Copyright is not applicable for releases too!
So, no one can really complain to someone here in TPB about the ownership of releases.....

Remember you're not the copyright owner of the movie!

@Devriz
If you complain again, your account will be in danger. Final reminder......."
,TejasNair,2012-07-09T20:01Z,tykoon123 | Thanks for the casual support!
,deepz095,2012-07-09T22:24Z,"What the hell DevriZ is thinking... He is just pirated movie and he is telling he got the Copyright of that.. Here those who are dealing with TBP are supporting piracy. The DevriZ is cheating the Film makers those who are spending so much money and effort and he don't like him to be cheated... How does it gonna work....

So don't try to mess up here..."
