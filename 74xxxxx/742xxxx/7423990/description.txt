The Bachelor King
This is the journey of a typical King Penguin from awkward adolescent to adult. Stunning cinematography takes us into an extraordinary sub-Antarctic island, home to majestic albatrosses, brawling elephant seals - and six million penguins. Though our hero's harsh world may be alien to our day-to-day lives, his struggle will be familiar to us all. Three years ago, The Bachelor King left home. He partied at sea - he adventured, he matured. And now he is returning to the place where he was born and raised: Penguin City. This is one of the most densely-packed, sought-after pieces of real estate in the entire southern hemisphere and somehow he must establish his own place in it. He must find a mate. He wants to be a dad. But how? What follows is a journey through the most challenging time of the Bachelor King's life. There is joy and terror, a ton of hard work - and some laughs. Our hero has to grow up fast. He meets the penguin of his dreams, and together they set out to raise a family. Before long, they have their egg. The two of them take turns to nurture it - one incubating, while the other zooms off to sea to find food. And then, one happy day, their chick hatches. And the hard work really begins. His story is often comic, sometimes tragic, and ultimately triumphant: a rite of passage set on one of the earth's last great wildernesses. With David Attenborough
