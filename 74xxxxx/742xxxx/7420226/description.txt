Ok folks, another game soundtrack here, with Space Marine.
A cool game, I'd give it 6-7/10, it gets a bit repetative. THIS IS THE SOUNDTRACK, NOT GAME :)

I couldn't be bothered writing up the details, but the files are all named and numbered correctly etc.

Composed by Sascha Dikicyan & Cris Velasko.

It's a pretty heavy orchestra, good for foreboding background music, could play whilst working/homeworking, or mute games that have terrible soundtracks and play over the top ;)

For this I'd give the soundtrack more out of ten than the game.

Enjoy :)

PS
Any hints, help, questions, ideas for future torrents etc please let me know in comments :)
If it's great, then plz rate it up. Cheers all, hope it downloads fast for y'all :)
