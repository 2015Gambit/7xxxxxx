,kingbmw,2012-07-09T16:31Z,Wow this is great thanks
,Toxin07,2012-07-09T18:28Z,This is shit. Audio is fucked up.
,nl_spacecowboy,2012-07-09T18:43Z,Actually this is finally the first good english copy I have seen. The audio is missing for the first 2 minutes but then its fine. Extremely watchable A-8 V-8 M-10 Thanks for the upload aliibhatti
,ggryzegg,2012-07-09T19:59Z,It is true that the video is quite watchable but the audio is so shitty it ruins the whole experience...
,meatboy805,2012-07-09T23:48Z,Fcuk you. sound is shitty as hell and you skipped over the best action scene in the movie. eat my balls i hate you. no i do not appreciate this
,BaGoBuDs,2012-07-10T00:23Z,lol idk what you guys are talking about. Video is ez 9 & audio starts right away for me & is crisp. You guys need to update your codecs or get rid of your blown speakers. a/v 9
,XxyourmasterxX,2012-07-10T01:56Z,it is true that the A. is kinda bad but the video is a easy 8 or 9 for a cam just need to tweek the settings alittle great upload thx bro best out there right nowXD
,Fortuity,2012-07-10T02:06Z,"BaGoBuDs, what media player are you using? Because I have the latest vlc, and I have no audio for the first 2 minutes, and horrible audio after that. If you have better, please share with us."
,treecheetaholo,2012-07-10T05:28Z,"A-4
V-7

I have trouble hearing it too, the audio sounds muffled. The first two minutes or so there's no audio, but this seems like the best one on the bay so far. "
,Spiderwoody,2012-07-10T06:40Z,"A= 6.5
V= 8.5/9.0

No audio clip until 2:09 mark, but not like it matters. The audio is original ""theater"" audio(echo). For shut-ins like myself(due to health issues), this copy is totally worth it. Great video quality; the audio is certainly ""do-able"". As of yet, this is the only one worth d/l'n, imo."
,thoufu75,2012-07-10T13:55Z,"v can watch video ... but audio really suckkkzz up ...  nyc way i din download , i m watching samething in online ... anyway thnx .."
,Goodquality2012,2012-07-10T19:26Z,"This movie is very watchable, Sound wayy out of sync and missing the first 2mins 10 seconds. But other then that, its ok. Picture quality is a bit shoddy, clear, but looks how an old movie would. A - 6 V 8

I also want to add in that I am SOOO glad i never went to the movies to see this. SUCH a disappointment."
,namrepusmt,2012-07-11T01:28Z,tnx!!
,blueridgedew,2012-07-11T02:19Z,"to everyone that is having problems hearing this throughout the movie, you're all a bunch of non having anything to do with nothing of decent sound for anything, or you need to put the shit out of your ears... Thank you for the upload... It's just fine accept for the first minute or two without sound, but after that it's cool..."
,hc32king,2012-07-11T12:20Z,Audio-5
,KevinCostner,2012-07-11T16:42Z,Hopefully someone can take this Video and sync it with a good audio track.
,trippinballs,2012-07-11T19:19Z,Go see it in the theatres. It's worth it. Or wait for a better copy to come out.
,LCSINpatria,2012-07-12T09:57Z,"I was thinking the same thing KevinCostner , i was also thinking that you should make better movies"
,umairey,2012-07-12T17:33Z,fuck u mother fuker u wasted my time to download this piece of shit

[T],aliibhatti,2012-07-12T19:04Z,"@umairey..then you better spend money from ur pocket & watch this MOVIE on BIG CINEMA SCREEN..else,,shit somewhere else"
,KevinCostner,2012-07-12T19:40Z,Hey I thought I was pretty good in Hatfields And McCoys.
,Juxhin_666,2012-07-13T10:29Z,The audio is so fucked up...you can't hear shit. But the video quality is watchable for a cam. Pretty good actually. The only problem is the audio : I think i'll wait for DVD'release.
