,MasterColac,2012-07-09T07:57Z,"Its worse quality than the cosa nostra

A:6"
,CaptainEvil83,2012-07-09T10:32Z,"I actually would give this a negative quality rating if possible.

A:2 (you can make out the words)
V:-5 (the most horrible quality i have ever seen)"
,Tankerbot,2012-07-09T20:48Z,"It looks like someone vomited on the camera lens then wiped it away smearing it all up and making it blurry.

It's good to know somoone out there knows how to turn off auto-focus. But too bad he/she left it on a bad focus setting. Hell my phone has auto focus, but I can let it focus on something, then turn off the auto focus and it will leave it on whatever focus it had been on.

Further proving my cell phone (which takes 720p video) will most definitely do better quality then this garbage.... :P"
