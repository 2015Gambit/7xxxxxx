,ruiz107,2012-07-09T23:22Z,Thanks again BasilBrush!! I'm helping the upload with over 200mbit on my seedbox :)
,Rush,2012-07-10T00:04Z," @BasilBrush Thanks for the up.... the highlights are much more entertaining than watching 3+hours of racing that really doesn't impact the results of the contenders. IMHO

@ruiz107 should be more peers like you, if the majority wouldn't reduce their upload allocation while downloading we would all benefit. 

Send up more pieces and you get more pieces back faster.... simple concept."

,bkkbull,2012-07-10T12:25Z,"thanks BasilBrush 
great as always 
Pity about morons like Bonham. perhaps if he got off his sofa he might actually appreciate a good sportsman. "
,BasilBrush,2012-07-10T17:57Z,"Rest Day 1 (10th July 2012)
Highlights of the race so far will be available about 8:30pm GMT (9:30pm BST)."
,John_Bonham,2012-07-12T04:05Z,bkkbull....FUCK YOU!!! you're fully misinformed!!! go to cycling forum and read everyting about that wanker ass wipe!!!
,John_Bonham,2012-07-12T04:18Z,Once this wanker was asked about doping he immediately went nuts! wiggo the wanker is probably doping to the gills he just hates the fact that he's really doing it just like his idol lance pharmstrong did for 7 fucking years.
