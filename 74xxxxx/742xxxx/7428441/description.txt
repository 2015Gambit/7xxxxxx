Perfect Resize 7 (was Genuine Fractals 7)... It's the same great product, just with a new name and it remains the industry standard for enlarging and resizing images. Perfect Resize, formerly Genuine Fractals, is renowned across the photographic and printing industries for its ability to increase image size without the loss of sharpness or detail that you might normally expect. The patented, fractal-based interpolation algorithms work like nothing else and the results speak for themselves.
