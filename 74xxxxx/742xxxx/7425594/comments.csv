@Johann-Weiss
Turn off your computer and stay away from it for now. Your brain is not yet well developed to handle such complicated machines.


They banned me, because I told the truth. They don't like criticism. Well, what can you expect from super censored country like that... 
That site is so bugged.. or just lacks IQ. They may know, how to ban, but the rest of the programming, in NMM and on their site, is so amateur. I might as well make a video ""1001 ways to hack Nexusmods - for computer illiterates"". One example: if you got banned, keep your login cookie - you can stay logged in forever and keep on commenting and rating and downloading. xD
I still wish to reply to that faggot, who banned me: """"Suck my dick"" is a beautiful sentence. And it would be even more beautiful if you did it NOW."""
