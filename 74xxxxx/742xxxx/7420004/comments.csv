,eddy1337,2012-07-07T20:53Z,"Thanks for uploading, and to everyone downloading, at least upload the same amount of data that you download so the ratio is 1, at least! Dont just download and stop it(Its ok with torrents that have been here a while and is stable, but with new ones, let them seed for a while!)"

,chickymamma1000,2012-07-07T23:42Z,"This comment isn't related to this torrent, however I have a question regarding seed ratio..i have a file that took me a week to dl, so i've been seeding it for some time..the share ratio is now 238...are there any down sides to such a large share ratio?"

,swissjoe,2012-07-10T02:36Z," Being included in the Sundance Festival List makes it a good enough to watch, provided your IQ is a match. If not, chase up a spiderman movie. "
