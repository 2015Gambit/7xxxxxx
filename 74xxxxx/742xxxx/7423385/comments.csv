,Romeox0306,2012-07-09T20:55Z,Your torrents are amazing.  I really wish I could learn how to do what you do.  Not enough time.  Just wondering if the past Bourne movies were on your list?  Thank you so much for all you have done.
,Katneni143,2012-07-10T06:36Z,"Hi TR...

Please let me know if U can upload Clash of the Titans (2010) movie.?"
[T],tr108,2012-07-11T04:17Z,"@Romeoxo0306 - I hope to get to the Bourne films (soonish) but if you want 'em now in 1080p, they were just upped by by fellow iTunes encoder JC (https://thepiratebay.se/user/justneustis/).

He's techrod108 approved. (lol)"
[T],tr108,2012-07-11T04:20Z,@Katneni143 - I (probably) won't get to Clash (and Wrath) of the Titans any time soon. I would like to do them tho...
,woritstoh,2012-07-12T14:00Z,Amazing quality ! Thanks a lot.
,woritstoh,2012-07-12T14:07Z,"After downloading all your Pixar stuff in 720p quality, I tried this one to see if it would play on my old PowerMac G5 2x1.8GHz, Mac OS 10.5.8 with VLC v 2.0.1.
Well, it plays perfectly well, except that I don't seem to have access to the subtitles.
Anyway, thanks again for the exceptionnal quality of your work !

video : 10/10.
audio : 10/10.

You're a Master !"
[T],tr108,2012-07-13T23:50Z,"@woritstoh - thx for doing the testing for me. I wonder if VLC 2.0.2 makes any difference? I seem to recall that it brings some features back in for PowerPC machines.

And I appreciate the kind words. :)"
