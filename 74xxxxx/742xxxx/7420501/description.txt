First off, this is complete and put in order according to DVD and iTunes.

There is 1 MP4 File, 9 mkvs, and the rest are avi. 

I had to do some heavy digging on the net to find the missing 5 or so episodes. Got em now so heres your torrent.


Enjoy


Oh also, 1 episode, Picks and Ricks, does not have an intro on purpose.
