,NYTDDS,2012-07-10T00:29Z,It's not Called The Pick The Pawn and the Polish. It's called Picks and Ricks. Ever heard of Wikipedia?

,BagOfDicks,2012-07-11T23:08Z,Just use a decent client and you'll have the option to pick the files you want to download from a magnet link the same way you do with a regular torrent.
,elmojr,2012-07-12T19:31Z,Thanks for the tip! It works perfectly. :)
