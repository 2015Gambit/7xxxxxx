THE CAM IT IS NICE SHOOTED BUT THE ORIGINAL OF THIS MOVIE FILE GOT REALLY HIGH BLACK BORDERS , WHAT I MEAN IS THAT ABOUT 40% OR MORE OF THE SCREEN AT FULLSCREEN VIEW ON THE ORIGINAL MOVIE FILE ARE BLACK BORDERS WITH THE VIEWER GEETTING THE SENSATION THAT IT IS ONLY A WIDESCREEN FRACTION OF THE FULLSCREEN THAT THE MOVIE IS GOING ON ... 

THIS BLACK BORDERS WAS ENTIRELY REMOVED WITH THE EXCELLENT WORK OF THE DUB PLUGINS WHAT MAKES IN MY POINT OF VIEW HIGHLY RECOMENDABLE GET THIS FILE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR NOT SPEAKING ON THE NICE WORK ON THE COLOURS THAT GAIN MORE LIFE WITH THE ORIGINAL FILE SHOWING A LITLLE BRIGHTNESS UNFOCUS PARTICLES ON THE SCREEN BACKGROUND  , ALL OF THIS IT IS TRUE AND IT IS EASY TO VERIFY MY SPEECH ON THIS COMMENT MAKING A NORMAL COMPARATION WITH THE OTHER AVAILABLE CAMS FOR THE MOMENT ... I WROTE THIS COMMENT TO GET MORE ATTENTION FROM THE USERS ON THE BLACK BORDERS AT THE FULLSCREEN REMOVED SPECIALLY WITH AN ORIGINAL FILE WITH THE SCREEN CARACHTERISTICS AT FULLSCREEN THAT I ALREADY MENTIONATED ON THIS COMMENT ...

Happy movie to all of you ..."

[V],globeplus,2012-07-09T16:51Z,"To dhavalc2011 :

EVEN IF YOU CAN GET SUSPICIOUS ON MY OPINION , I WOULD SAY ACCEPTABLE TO WATCH FOR A FIRST AVAILABLE CAM BUT WITHOUT THE BLACK BORDERS AT THE FULLSCREEN VIEW ....

[V],globeplus,2012-07-09T17:55Z,"To dhavalc2011 : i understand your point of view and i must say that everything that was possible to do to improve the picture was done and like i said before for first cam not bad , i saw first cams for other movies worst than this one ...

,TheProfeshenal,2012-07-09T19:40Z,Seed please!! I've been stuck at 90 something percent for the pretty darn long now.. Seems to be a legit torrent so seed folks..
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-07-09T23:08Z,"video is good for a cam, one of the better ones we have seen lately, the sound is shit though, lots of distortion and hard to work out what people are saying sometimes. Use VLC to turn the treble up a bit on the sound and it makes it a bit better. If someone can get a line on the sound this would make an excellent TS version.

A4/V8.5"
