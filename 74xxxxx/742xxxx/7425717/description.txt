On this classic CD, originally recorded in the 1970s, we hear Swami Muktananda reciting Shri Guru Gita in his meditation room in Gurudev Siddha Peeth, the Siddha Yoga ashram in India. Baba accompanies himself on the ektara, a traditional one-stringed instrument. 

Shri Guru Gita, a sacred text drawn from ancient Indian scriptures, describes the Guru-disciple relationship and its supreme role in the attainment of Self-realization. Shri Guru Gita is recited in the morning in Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers.
