Too bad these wankers sold out this was really good freeware."
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-14T18:21Z,I was using v3.25 which had a patch that worked fine. I'm using 7 64bit and after I installed it will not let me open the program to enter serial without rebooting first. Instructions say don't reboot and enter serial. Also what is the host file to edit? It doesn't say. 
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-14T18:23Z,I did reboot and entered serial and it is now Pro version but I don't know if it will stay that way.

,coolnsexy19,2012-07-22T13:04Z,"Uploader please help:
I downloaded and installed was able to surf the web on my android device. The software somehow updated itself to 3.5 and it stopped working. I guess i should have edited the host file to stop it from updating itself. Now I uninstalled it using RevoUninstaller pro and reinstalled but it doesnt work at all. I tried this many times but failed. 
what can I do now in order to make it work?"
