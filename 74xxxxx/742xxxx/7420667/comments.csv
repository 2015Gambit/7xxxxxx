,Rocha54,2012-07-28T20:11Z,"Hello. today I've downloaded the assassins, and I have a problem when I open it I just keep thinking and not doing anything.
I installed everything right. What can I do to fix it?"
,littleman33,2012-08-02T21:30Z,"This installs as a charm and works like a charm until I came to memory 3, sequence 7. Whenever I am going into the fight it just crashes ("".exe has stopped working""). I'm sure there's some fix, but to aware you or anyone else."
,littleman33,2012-08-02T21:35Z,"I fixed this by using the task manager to let ACRSP.exe only use one core (CPU 0). Notice that I had to press the ""Show process of all users"" (UAC) to be allowed to change processor cores."
