Game description: Final Fantasy X, the tenth installment of the Final Fantasy series, is one of the most compatible games for PCSX2. It's not very picky about the choice of plugins and also doesn't need a high-end PC to run fluently. There are some known issues with it though, but most of them are easy to avoid or very minor.

CPU:  Intel E2200 @ 2.2ghz, AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ 3GHz
