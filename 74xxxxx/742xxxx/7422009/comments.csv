,sounddd,2012-07-08T08:33Z,Keep seeding if you're finished - my upload is shit and otherwise this will die very soon!
,sounddd,2012-07-09T23:01Z,"Oh yeah, and my computer will not run 24/7 - expect it to be not seeded for some hours a day."
,trask42,2012-07-16T05:49Z,"Thanks, sounddd. I'm done downloading and I am seeding the holy hell out of this file. Been doing so for the last seven days."
,sounddd,2012-07-16T07:43Z,"You're welcome! And thanks right back to you, I've already uploaded 28 GB with my crappy connection :D"
,trask42,2012-07-16T10:34Z,"Well, I switched the file to my other Mac and put it in my Torrents folder and did all the same settings...but, as it turns out, it's trying to re-download the entire file again for some reason. 

So, I am seeding here until it completes on my Mac Mini where I can seed it from there. I'm doing anywhere from 100k - 250k/sec from the first computer, seeding.

I will do everything I can to keep seeding this file. It's well worth it. You did EXACTLY what I tried to do a couple years ago with my shitty 480p copy: do a fully-extended version of Grindhouse with all the extra footage and trailers. 

The only difference between yours and mine was that I added the ""Hobo With a Shotgun"" trailer...but, honestly, I don't care that your version doesn't have that. This is just as badass and the file quality is second to none."
,sounddd,2012-07-16T19:33Z,"Ah crap - you could have probably not started it and then clicked ""Force re-check"" and it might have worked, but too late now I guess.

I didn't even know about the hobo with a shotgun trailer until now, was it in the theatrical version but not on the BD Release? It seems to be hilarious, though, so more's the pity :/

I'll definitley have to watch Hobo with a Shotgun then, I guess.

Thanks for your awesome feedback!"
,trask42,2012-07-16T23:18Z,"No worries. It's down now and seeding on the Mac Mini. :) We're good. :)

I'm wondering if it was re-checking. It looked like a download...might have been mistaken.

No, Hobo With a Shotgun was the result of Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a ""trailer contest"" to see who could make the best Grindhouse movie trailer. Hobo won the prize. Strangely, it was made into a major movie by the same filmmaker who made the original trailer. They even got Rutger Hauer to be in the film.

I included the trailer before Machete with some fancy editing. The problem with doing this, however, is that the contest trailer is in pretty low quality and won't match the 1920 x 1080 resolution. 

It doesn't matter much, though. :) Everything is all good. :)"
,sounddd,2012-07-17T02:54Z,"I found out via google that it was in some screenings in Canada actually.

I would have just upscaled it to 1080p since I had to reencode everything to exactly the same to fit together in one .avi.

I just downloaded Hobo with a shotgun the not unrated version, but I'm still waiting for the unrated version to finish (of course that one takes forever, as usual -___-)"
,trask42,2012-07-17T04:49Z,"You've done quite enough, sir. If you wanted to add Hobo, you could...but this file is something I have been looking for since it came out on DVD. 

I own Grindhouse on BR. I own both films on DVD (extended) but what you've done here (and in 1080 format, no less!) is great! 

Just to be clear, I am seeding the hell out of it. It's now done downloading on my other Mac, so we are all good as far as that goes.

Hobo is an added delight if you decided to add it but that's entirely up to you and NOT required. I am sure that everyone who has this file is in pig heaven. :)"
,sounddd,2012-07-17T09:32Z,"I probably won't do it, far too lazy for that :D

I'm really, really glad you like it and uploading it has already proven to be worth it - I was almost afraid that this torrent would go down with all the other torrents about Grindhouse on here.

You probably know that recut version of Sin City, right? What's always bugged me about that is that after every stupid part there's 10 minutes of credits, so I've cutted those out and added the credits of the theatrical version to the end - would you be interested in that, too? It's also 1080p but no AC3 sound since I stupidly encoded it to 320kbps mp3 and deleted the source movie files already."
,trask42,2012-07-22T00:10Z,"I just might like that. I thought about doing that one, too. :) I would get that and seed that as well. :) Your Grindhouse file is now seeded at 112 GB's and still chugging along.

Just FYI, sir. :)"
,sounddd,2012-07-28T11:15Z,"That's awesome, because I couldn't seed very much the last days.

Here's the Sin City version! :) Unfortunately it cut off the title, I mean there COULD be some check whether it's too long or not ...
