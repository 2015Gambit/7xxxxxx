DESCRIPTION:

Nick Spalding tried to write a book in 24 hours. Turns out that's impossible... it took 30!

Life... With No Breaks is a unique, hilarious and heartfelt look at the modern world we live in, told by a master story-teller with much to say - and only a weekend to say it in.
You'll laugh out loud reading Nick's odyssey of non-stop writing in a collection of anecdotes, asides and stories - all dredged up from an over-stimulated brain functioning on caffeine, nicotine and the occasional chocolate biscuit.
The book is a conversation with you, and with Nick you'll venture into the thorny topics of love, life, sex, horribly timed bowel movements and a deathly fear of sponges (among many other things).
After you've read Life... With No Breaks, you may never look at the world the same way again!

Reviews:

"You have to admire any writer who can produce a book as hilarious as this in just over a day. Bastard!" - Stephen Leather, best selling author
"A collection of anecdotes, adventures and confessions that reads as satisfyingly as a novel. It's paced, it's organised, it's witty, it's wise, it's from the hip. There's never a dull moment." - Neil Marr, editor in chief, BeWrite Books
"I thought it was a scream of a book... and that was before I knew its history - that Nick had written the whole thing in a single sitting." - Mark Coker, Smashwords founder & CEO
"This isn't a typical, run-of-the-mill memoir book. It's more an extremely funny series of short stories linked with Spalding's opinions and thoughts about the world. He wrote it in a single period of 30 hours, which is pretty incredible!" - Amazon Reviewer
