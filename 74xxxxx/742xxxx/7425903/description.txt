Brothers Anson and Eric Dawkins began their gospel performing careers as children, teaming with their mother in a trio that appeared at revivals headlined by their father, a Pentecostal preacher. As teens, Eric also learned piano, while Anson studied drums and trumpet; they both ultimately joined the band Commissioned before breaking away as Dawkins & Dawkins in 1992, signing to the Benson label to record their self-titled debut LP, a fusion of contemporary gospel with overtones of rap and R&B. Necessary Measures followed in 1994, and after a lengthy hiatus that saw the brothers pursuing production, songwriting and even acting projects, Dawkins & Dawkins returned in 1998 with Focus.
