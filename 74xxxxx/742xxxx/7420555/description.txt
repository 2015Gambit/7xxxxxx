In this bundle.. more updates or chats about Baltic Sea USO 
and other news for Early July and some new released presentations
about hackers finding UFO material
I wait for more confirmed UFO sighting news before I include them in
the next Bundle release.. but theres  been a few videos of a UFO sighting
during filming of the fires in USA appearing.. (but they could be
remote drones with cameras or more earthly explanations right)

PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.
