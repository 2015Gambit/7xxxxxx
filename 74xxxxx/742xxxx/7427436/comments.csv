byss@byssmacbook:~/Downloads [17:10]$ sudo mkdir '/Library/Preferences/HL2 Lost Coast Preferences'
Password: 
byss@byssmacbook:~/Downloads [17:10]$ sudo chmod 777 HL2 Lost Coast Preferences/

After this the app works perfectly."

sudo chmod 777 '/Library/Preferences/HL2 Lost Coast Preferences'"

As I tried to move the app to the /Applications folder, Sophos Anti-Virus threw the following error:

Threat detected by Sophos Anti-Virus
'Virus/Spyware' Mal/VB-TR has been detected and listed in Quarantine Manager.

Another problem arose during transfer, this one a system error:

""The operation can't be completed because one or more required items can't be found (Error code -43)""

I was using an account with administrator privileges, in OS 10.7.4.

While Mal/VB-TR is Windows malware, I'm going to delete everything out of an abundance of caution. In any case, I can't actually transfer the file because of the Error -43. 

If anyone knows of a workaround, please post here. In the interim, I'd recommend against seeding this torrent.

To the original poster: Thank you for making the attempt to post this; I've been wishing I could play this for a long time. Hopefully we'll be able to figure out how to get a working version free of malware alerts sometime soon. Best of luck."
,mycophage,2012-07-10T15:01Z,"Following up on my comment from yesterday: I took a chance and disabled my on-access virus scanning; this seemed to take care of both the malware warning and the ""file not found"" error. I continued the installation per the instructions and everything seemed to go fine. I'm assuming that MAL/VB-TR can only do mischief on Windows machines...I suppose we'll see."
