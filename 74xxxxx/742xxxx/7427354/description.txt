These features allows to turn reading into a useful and fascinating process, and reduce eye strain.

AutoReader allows to read much larger text, what's important not only for people with impaired vision.
But also, for example, in transport, on the go, on the running machine, etc. when focusing on a small text tiring for the eyes or impossible.

Moreover, 3D Stereo mode can even be beneficial for the eyes, if done right, the visual axis
are parallel (as when looking at the horizon), which relaxes the external eye muscles, and the focus is on the stereo pair,
that helps to synchronize the focus of both eyes, which is also useful, as it's often one eye focuses better than the other (we can be unaware of it, but simply feel tired).


Read for the benefit of your eyes! But that's not all, AutoReader allows you to read faster than usual.

AutoReader increases the speed of reading and helps get rid of subvocalization, one of the main factors slowing down the reading process. Subvocalization - it is hidden, unconscious movement of the lips, tongue and other organs of speech.
The habit to pronounce the words formed in the childhood, when learning to read, and does not disappear completely, without any special training.
Try to gradually increase the speed of displaying words (slide your finger up the screen), with the growth of speed the vocal apparatus is no longer keep up with the volume of information and no longer involved in the processing - information from the visual analyzer will be immediately sent to the meaning.
The feel is cool, as if you just catch the author's idea, not a speech.
You realize that you can read much faster and without much effort.
