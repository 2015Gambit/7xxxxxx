Close, but no cigar. It's either 40 weeks, or 3 years-can't decide. Can SOMEONE please seed or whatever it's called, so I won't have wasted 3 hours?? PLEASE!!!"
,cutecat42,2012-07-17T16:50Z,"The first three seasons have been downloaded. Should I give up hope for season 4 and 5? It's been stuck at 83.4% since hour 3, and it's been almost 10 hours of downloading."
,alumman,2012-07-18T00:25Z,"Does it have paid surveys and stuff,because i wasted downloading season 5 that had paid surveys on another torrent"
,cutecat42,2012-07-19T00:05Z,"No, it's free. You only get seasons 1-3, though-thanks for that. I mean, really. Torrents for season 5 are everywhere, but season 4 is nowhere to be found. There are a few out there, but no seeders-so no download."
,RummyKid,2012-07-19T09:39Z,"omg guys...im sorry i had no  idea...ill seed from tomorrow, i swear"

,rumpel,2012-07-25T10:24Z,Thanks!
,nazim12366,2012-08-07T20:38Z,how good is the quality and does it include every ep? i'm suprised to find this in such a small size. usually one season is 4 gig.
,nazim12366,2012-08-07T20:42Z,"btw @alluman are you clicking on the ads. this website is full of ads like ""download now"" which is an ad and fake, usually torrents don't require you to do surveys. use firefox or google chrome with adblock. download by clicking ""get this torrent"" with the magnet next to it."
,nazim12366,2012-08-07T21:24Z,"started downloading but there are alot of files saying ""padding file... if you see this, update to bitcomet 0.85 or above"". i use u torrent. do i need to do anything or can i just delete those? there's like a hundred of those and they take up some data"
,luis_ironmaiden,2012-08-09T00:39Z,"wtf are the files called
""_____padding_file_0_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above____"" ?"

,ockabatuka,2012-09-07T00:01Z,"good torrent
