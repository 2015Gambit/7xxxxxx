J For Justice - 7/7 Ripple Effect 2 (DVD Rip)

Following the enormous success and world-wide acclaim that the original '7/7 Ripple Effect' received, as attested to below, Muad'Dib is back and revealing even more hard-hitting facts that should leave the viewer in no doubt that the government's official conspiracy theory about what happened on 7/7 is a pack of lies.

"I must say, in my opinion this is a masterpiece. In less than an hour, he film explains how this whole event was planned, how it was staged, what went wrong, how the authorities sought to cover it up and the failure of the press to cover it adequately. I think it is as marvellous a microcosm for understanding the nature of inside-jobs as anyone has ever produced, so I must congratulate you and tell you how much I admire your work."
James H. Fetzer, professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota, about the original 7/7 Ripple Effect

"It is an example of critical journalism that draws on public news sources to formulate a controversial, but plausible, theory. After deploying three different theories of truth to develop insights into new and existing evidence, it is the BBC / Government theory that has a lower level of correspondence with known 'facts', is incoherent to the point of being implausible, and is more likely to distort its reports because of institutional controls and political pressures."
Rory Ridley-Duff Ph.D., senior lecturer in human resource management and organisation behaviour, Sheffield Hallam University.

Tony Farrell, the principal intelligence analyst for South Yorkshire police, said that after seeing 7/7 Ripple Effect and other documentaries and personally researching the case that he could only conclude that the official 7/7 narrative was 'a monstrous lie.'
