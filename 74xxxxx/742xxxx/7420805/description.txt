For an understanding of "computer vision." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision

If you want a basic understanding of computer visionΓÇÖs underlying theory and algorithms, this hands-on introduction is the ideal place to start. YouΓÇÖll learn techniques for object recognition, 3D reconstruction, stereo imaging, augmented reality, and other computer vision applications as you follow clear examples written in Python.

Programming Computer Vision with Python explains computer vision in broad terms that wonΓÇÖt bog you down in theory. You get complete code samples with explanations on how to reproduce and build upon each example, along with exercises to help you apply what youΓÇÖve learned. This book is ideal for students, researchers, and enthusiasts with basic programming and standard mathematical skills.

Learn techniques used in robot navigation, medical image analysis, and other computer vision applications
Work with image mappings and transforms, such as texture warping and panorama creation
Compute 3D reconstructions from several images of the same scene
Organize images based on similarity or content, using clustering methods
Build efficient image retrieval techniques to search for images based on visual content
Use algorithms to classify image content and recognize objects
Access the popular OpenCV library through a Python interface
