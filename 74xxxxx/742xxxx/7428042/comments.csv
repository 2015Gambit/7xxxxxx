,babybluetits24,2012-07-10T16:23Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948470/ imdb score 7.7 buy a cinema ticket if u want it in sync 

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 47 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,smknjoker,2012-07-11T00:48Z,"Points? lmfao. And I don't see anywhere where the uploader said ""This is the best copy!"". Even though it's true. This is as good as it gets at the moment. And if you think YOU can do better by all means go ahead go through all that work of shooting the video, recording the audio, editing the video, syncing them perfect, uploading it risking prosecution by the law and watch as a army of whiny punks comment on how they think it was a waste of time and energy. 

-End fucking rant "
