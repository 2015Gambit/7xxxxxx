Invasion USA (1952)

The exploitation masterpiece Invasion USA begins when a mysterious stranger
(Academy Award nominee Dan O'Herlihy) engages a diverse group of Manhattan bar
patrons in a discussion on the best way to beat Communism.  Suddenly, a real
Red Alert is declared and enemy parachutists by the thousands begin landing on
American soil!  Soon atom bombs are dropping, skyscrapers are crumbling and
fifth columnists are taking over key industries.  Through it all, a suave,
street-smart reporter (Gerald Mohr) and a beautiful debutante (Peggie Castle)
desperately try to find time for romance amid the chaos.


Red Nightmare (1962)

Produced under the "personal supervision" of Jack L. Warner, the Red Scare
classic had a budget and a cast (Jack Webb, Jack Kelly, Andrew Duggan) that
was unheard of for a government educational film of its era.  Indeed, not many
government shorts before or since have been featured in Daily Variety as
Freedom And You (later retitled Red Nightmare by the studio to give it more
"punch") was.

The story presents Jerry Donovan (Jack Kelly) as a complacent citizen who
experiences a dream in which his town has been taken over by Communists. 
Jack Webb acts as narrator, antagonist and muse.

The Complacent Americans ΓÇô Official Civil Defense Survival Instructions (1961)

The shocking spoken word "flipside" to If The Bomb Falls dramatizes an actual
H-bomb attack on a fictional city as witnessed by a woefully complacent
American.
