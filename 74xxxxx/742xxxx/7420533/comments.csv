I've been stuck at 97.3% for a week and it won't budge."
[T],Auge,2012-07-07T17:21Z,"Contempt is an old one for me, I will seed this again until it is complete then itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s up to you guys to keep it going.

Doing this for you baybeh."
,baybeh,2012-07-07T18:49Z,"Thanks a ton, Auge. I'm grateful. And yep, I'll be seeding it now. "

thanx!"
[T],insinuendo,2012-07-08T11:52Z,"Love this one, and it's not a feel-good film, but Bogart is so convincing, it is sad because it somehow represents a part of his true nature veritably.

Thanks for another great share and your continued efforts!"
,kepler42,2012-07-26T11:27Z,"Question: What's the format of this re-compressed DVD? I mean is it PAL (likely to be 720x576) or NTSC ( 640x480) ??
Thanks for the upload, and your answer.."
