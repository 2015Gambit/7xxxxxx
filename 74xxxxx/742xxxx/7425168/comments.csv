,mike953100,2012-07-08T21:15Z,I messed up the title; it should read: The.Three.Stooges.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY.

,zathras69,2012-07-16T09:34Z,So whats the difference between a Blue Ray and a Blue Disc? And does this one have the same hardcoded subs that intermittently pops up (5-6 times) in the top of the screen like the Feel-Free and MgB rips have?
,mike953100,2012-07-16T16:58Z,"@ zathras69
here is no difference between Blu Ray and Blu Disc.  The full name of a Blu Ray is Blu Ray Disc which gets abbreviated to BD which people then incorrectly interpret to mean Blu Disc.  Also, these subtitles are not-hardcoded.  If you are using VLC Media Player, you can Right Click, Subtitle, Disable to not have the subtitles or you can simply delete the: The.Three.Stooges.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY.srt file. "
,zathras69,2012-07-16T21:11Z,"It's intermittent hard coding. VLC (hit V by default to disable subs), I even took the srt file out of the folder (I also post srts on subscene). The first occurrence is at 3:00, props to waninoko for the address from his comments for the Feel-Free release, the one you made the BR-BD comment on. http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/4129/41892635.png. This is from his copy, my DL from MgB is exactly the same. It comes up at least 5-6 times, more during the last 1/2 hour, just one inadvertent line at a time. It is not constant. Your source is the same as Feel-Free. So...does yours have this artifact?"
,mike953100,2012-07-16T21:36Z,"I'm pretty sure mine doesn't have random intermittent hardcoded subs, but I could be wrong.  I haven't actually watched this movie.  Here are some screens I took at 2:58, 2:59, and 3:01 without subtitles.

,mike953100,2012-07-16T22:49Z,It appears that my 2nd screenshot at 2:59 is at the same time as your screenshot just to let you know.
,zathras69,2012-07-17T04:43Z,"Thanks for the effort.  That entire scene is completely covered in the MgB and Feel-Free DLs....so I'll give it a shot, it's only 1.5GB. Just wish the bit rate was higher (55"" at 12ft), overall bit rate and video bit rate are not the same, but it's not like this is CGI intensive."
,zathras69,2012-07-17T05:54Z,"No artifact!!! Video bit rate is 1835, MgBs is 2800 so the edges aren't as crisp, but with a tweak in sharpness in VLC, not to shabby, more than acceptable. Can't comment on the audio cuz I convert it to AC3 then re-mux. I appreciate all your effort."
,mike953100,2012-07-17T06:23Z,"You are welcome!  And yeah, I keep the bitrate lower on purpose to keep file size down.  And mediainfo shows me no video or audio bitrate because I use Adavanced Audio Codec (AAC) instead of AC-3 because it is the superior of the codes.  Have a good one!"
,zathras69,2012-07-17T07:37Z,"Guess it depends what your listening through. On a laptop or using xbox or PS3 you may notice a difference using AAC, but my computer is connected to my H&K receiver, there is a HUGE difference in separation and clarity using AC3 (or DTS) over AAC. Conversion with TFM audio tool and re-muxing in mkvmerge takes like 4 minutes total, this one took 3, so no biggy. I mean there is no comp between the 2 if outputting through a digital receiver, it's two different worlds. Thanks for the UL! "
