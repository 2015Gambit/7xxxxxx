Note:  If you are watching this on a laptop, PC, Monitor, or any normal-sized TV, you will not notice any difference between this 1.5gb sized version and the source of 5.28gb.  The only way you will notice the difference is if you let the placebo effect take ahold of you or if you are watching on a large TV very close up.  Otherwise, there will be no difference.
