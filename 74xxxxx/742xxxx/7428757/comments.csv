Blade: the installation was pretty straight forward, try to close all the program before you install it."
,Blade5256,2012-07-11T00:17Z,"i restarted my Mac then tried it again and it runs through as if its about to install then the installation stops and says ""The Installation Failed The Installer Encountered An Error That Cause Installation To Fail Contact Software Manufacture For Assistance"" "
