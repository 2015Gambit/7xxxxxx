A Voice in the Wilderness - (PBS Doc on Edward Abbey)2005



Edward Abbey: A Voice in the Wilderness provides a wild ride with the late, great Edward Abbey, a singular environmentalist with a variety of followers, friends, and colleagues. This film captures Abbey's iconoclastic spirit wonderfully... so well that those of us who loved his writing (fiction and non-fiction) grieve anew for America's loss. Abbey fought hard (without taking himself for a saint) for the West... all too often a place trashed for greed at the expense of those who love it (including its wildlife). Every school ought to have a copy of this film. Every woman and man who loves the planet ought to have a copy. And we should all show it to as many friends as we have.
