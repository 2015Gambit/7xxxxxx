,CorpusM,2012-07-11T05:29Z,"This is a wicked torrent man! Although, it will have to be uploaded again when Fractions run ends with the new Marvel Now initiative. It was announced that this series is ending and will begin with a new writer with issue #1 some time later this year. Regardless, this is a wicked catch up for anyone unfamiliar with Fractions epic run. Thanks! "
