,waninoko,2012-07-09T03:25Z,"for some odd reason there will be a subtitle showing up in some scene. you cant turn it off because it seems hardcoded. it shows up on the screen itself, not where subs usually are but right in the middle with large fonts. i dont know if its on my end but definitely annoying.
