,iamnerp,2012-07-07T19:58Z,"footy, I created an account just to thank you for your dedication to uploading Formula 1 torrents. I'm from the States and I hate the Speed coverage. Your torrents are always up quickly and are great quality. Much appreciated."
,griedarw,2012-07-07T19:59Z,"@Footy - Thanks.

@VuDu4000 - I'll get my retaliation in early.  A big fuck you from me to you. You SUCK (your mothers c**k). "

,deim0n,2012-07-07T20:33Z,There is no BBC broadcast for the British Grand Prix. That's too bad because SKY's program doesn't measure up to the BBC.
