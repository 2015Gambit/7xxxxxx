    Supermodel Sanjana and Rohan, son of     
    one of the nation's foremost business    
    tycoons have been one of the most        
    popular couples in the social circuit.   
    When Sanjana decides against flying      
    to Paris at the last minute- for a       
    lucrative modeling assignment, she       
    does so, not just because she cannot     
    bear to stay away from her boyfriend     
    Rohan, but more importantly because her  
    instincts push her against going.        
    But what her instincts cannot do is stop 
    Rohan from getting kidnapped.
