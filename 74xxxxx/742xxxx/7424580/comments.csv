I think open source is the future!!
To a0xx6: sorry i don't use 64 bits OS for searching crack:("
,a0xx6,2012-07-16T07:46Z,"@coder78 Alright, thats fine, I can use the 32 bit version. How do you go about searching for them though?"
,coder78,2012-07-16T19:51Z,I use hexray IDA 32 for disassembling ... but i don't have IDA 64 bits :(

I'd really appreciate if anyone could provide me with the offsets for 64-bit Windows. I'm running Windows 7 on my machine, and I really need to give this software a try. Thanks in advance."
