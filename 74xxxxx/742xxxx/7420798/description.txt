It might not be too surprising that the standout feature of Brooklynite tenor
saxophonist Stephen Gauci's Basso Continuo is the presence of two bassists in a
drummerless lineup. Even Wooley's trumpeting can't match the compelling
interaction that exists between Mike Bisio and the Norwegian Ingebrigt Håker
Flaten. Though listed as four separate tracks, these live pieces of Nididhyasana
(recorded in January 2007 at Downtown Music Gallery) have the quality of a
suite, a lengthy cracking of a single faultline. The basses are kept wide apart,
one in each speaker's spatial extreme, which draws even more attention to their
pointillist twanging, or even their twinned droning. As if in keeping with these
deep emanations, Wooley concentrates on a muted needling, as if trying to rise
above the low thrum. When all four players are coinciding in motion, a termite's
nest bustle erupts; but some of the most striking sections are when the two
bassmen are left alone to conduct their own conversation. Gauci almost finds
himself standing on the perimeter, his warm foxglove tone acting as a soothing
agent. Without a drummer, of course, there's little forward motion, the
improvisations tending to float in oily suspension. There are parts where all
band members are firing off at once and the climactic stretch of "Chitta Vilasa
is one such instance.
