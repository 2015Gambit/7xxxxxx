,aarque,2012-07-08T17:06Z,"This is a warez site, TPB stores trackers for softwares offered. Does the term ""pirate"" need elaboration?
TPB is not a simmer site, it is not an FSX site. The desire to share is understandable, but TPB was not designed as a ""catch all."" Torrents are fine and torrents are legal, you can easily offer this as a torrent or file through legitimate flight sim forums, like Avsim, a place where you can also receive and extend feedback and support.

One should be able to deduce that the tracker system could easily be overwhelmed by nuisance uploading. Since this file does not unlock software or benefit pirates in particular, it is not appropriate here.

 This thank you is from the opposition for helping further their goals of shutting down TPB and includes a very minor acknowledgement from me for the well intentioned, but misguided effort. Use this information to improve The Pirate Bay experience and we are all good."
,simicsasa75,2012-07-08T19:07Z,"""nuisance uploading""? Look around you and you will see bunch of useless stuff,and about this one I bet even you downloaded it because you will need it.Yes this is warez site but not all stuf here is warez. Come on man ,only because you upload FSX stuff no one else can? That's selfish. Bunch of people need this and here is where they will find it easy way.Anyway,thanks for comment,no offense.."
,aarque,2012-07-09T05:25Z,"It is you who are being selfish by ascribing to your own personal opinion. you are welcome to visit the Suprbay forums, research the topic, or, if all else fails, think logically.
The justification is that since everyone else you see is sinking the ship, you should blithely as well?

You clearly have never endured  the break down of the search engine. I have witnessed it at least twice. The only thing financing this site is the sidebars and regularly, demand exceeds capacity. It is usually down for three days to a week.

Besides the numbers don't lie. Nine seeders and zero leeches prove that this is a warez site and not an FSX support site. Look at any decent ware recently seeded: mickyfinnys Lancair, 41 seeders; alcluizPT's Mirage, 23 seeders. All I am saying is; you can help build the site, or you can piss on it like a fire hydrant. I'm just gonna comment either way. You seem like the conscientious, thoughtful type to me.

(By the way, UIautomationcore.dll has been uploaded many times here already, except nobody bothers to name their torrent after it, just like you - and - if those are Bojote shaders, they are lame, imo)

http://thepiratebay.se/search/fsx%20fix/0/3/0
Search term was ""FSX fix"" you will find two versions of the .dll in that list."
,simicsasa75,2012-07-09T14:43Z,"The point is that I reinstalled FSX on machine with win 8 and it is unplayable without this .dll, so i called it like this because it really brings back stability.
And about shader,It is from Boris Vorontsov.Just the .ini file is modified by Shade so that sky looks like the sun really shines. I personally do not like Boyote shader,I use FS Water Configurator. And about TPB,you are right,seen that couple of times,but things are goin' to be better because that stupid laws are gone.. for now at least. 
Keep on."
,flyerhk,2012-07-09T19:58Z,"I don't see any issues with posting this fix here - you don't like it arquee, just ignore it and move on... why all the drama?"
,simicsasa75,2012-07-09T20:29Z,"@flyehk
It's Ok. Everybody have right to opinion,he made his and posted some arguments,some of them are very much in place. It is much more better to do that and learn something new and get some conclusions than to use the f... word which only insults other human beings for nothing.
Thanks for support :)"
,cbboner,2012-07-10T01:05Z,this torrent sucks get rid of it
,aarque,2012-07-10T04:56Z,"Love it, all good.

Just so ya'll know, it is a direct violation of TPB rules to post two active, duplicate torrents. I don't think that covers when somebody jacks the tracker, I've done it, but there is a valid reason for the rule...

I don't even trip. I will tell you what's up and what I've seen and if people ignore it, I might use caps lock to comment on the next torrent."
,hitchup,2012-07-10T07:29Z,"aarque time someone cracks the Lockheed Martinâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Prepar3D, the software is perfect...."
,simicsasa75,2012-07-10T16:19Z,"@hitchup
And just in time when we all become masters in tweaking, copying and praying to our fsx .cfg file.
One day I will miss this, just like old C64 and all the quirks that came with it :)"
,hitchup,2012-07-10T19:25Z,"@simicsasa75
do not worry, P3D is FSX, the difference between them is only name.P3D better work with add-ons FSX. I have a friend who was with him and was very pleased. You only need to be cracked version which is posted here."
,aarque,2012-07-11T02:45Z,"Hmm, I thought I had a workable version of P3D. I'll have to check.
My new vid card arrives tomorrow so maybe I'll commission it on the new platform. You remember jimstalk, right? I was helping him about 6 months ago and teamviewed into his system, I was jealous at how fast his FSX loaded and switched aircraft, like almost instant. The lag was way to high to fly however, he is in Greece after all. I still yearn to get that performance with my bloated FSX, which currently occupies about 1.5 terabytes, between aircraft and scenery. Were that (decent load speeds) to happen, I would be much less reluctant to test stuff; heck, I would be building custom airports and stuff for my friends here at TPB. "
,hitchup,2012-07-11T13:54Z,"@aarque
P3D need serial + online activation...for more information

,simicsasa75,2012-07-11T15:22Z,"@aarque
 1.5 terabytes??! What do you have inside? And I was thinking that mine is eating my HDD,lol.
P3D would be nice because it is little more optimised for the graphics card,This dinosaur is eating my 3 processor cores and asking for much more,arghhh."
,aarque,2012-07-13T23:10Z,"a lot of the older photo scenery consumes vast disk space, unlike the ORBX stuff, so that is much of it. The other part is I install every airplane and chopper I can find, except for fictional stuff like that absurd Avelina, including anything FS9. If it doesn't work, I don't uninstall it because sometimes I can tweak .air or .cfg files to adapt them to FSX."
