The arrival of an eccentric boarder turns a young boy's life upside down. Ludwig van Beethoven has moved in upstairs! At first Christoph resents their new tenant but slowly he comes to understand the genius of the man, the torment of his deafness and the beauty of his music. In the end he is won over by the music and true incidents from the great composer's life. The music, all originally produced, includes excerpts of more than 35 of Beethoven's best-loved works."
