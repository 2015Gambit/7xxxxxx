How Far SP - Incorrect song order, plus ""Shadowboxing"" replaces one of the songs that should be there (track no 4, I believe)
Seeman SP - The album version of Seemann is actually the Faraway (single version) track.

This is what I managed to notice so far, both errors are easily fixable, since the required tracks can be found within the discography."

In their Worlds collide album, ""i dont care"" track souns more of like a live version minus the crowd."
