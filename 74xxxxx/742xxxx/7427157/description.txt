***********************************************************************************


Internet Download Manager supports all popular browsers including IE, AOL, MSN, 

Mozilla, Netscape, Firefox, Avant Browser, and many others. Internet Download 

Manager supports all versions of all popular browsers, and it can be integrated 

into any Internet application to take over downloads using unique "Advanced Browser 

Integration" feature.



When you click on a download link in a browser, IDM will take over the download and 

accelerate it. You don't need to do anything special, just browse the Internet as you 

usually do. IDM will catch your downloads and accelerate them. IDM supports HTTP, 

FTP, HTTPS and MMS protocols.



Internet Download Manager can record and download FLV videos from popular sites 

like YouTube, MySpaceTV, and Google Video. The best way of downloading webpage 

embedded videos from the Internet is here. After installing IDM, "Download This 

Video" button pops up whenever you are watching a video anywhere in the Internet. 

Just click on the button to start downloading clips.



Antivirus checking makes your downloads free from viruses and trojans. IDM can 

automatically run a scanner on download completion, like AdAware, Avast, Spybot, 

AVG Anti-Virus, McAfee, SpywareBlaster, CCleaner and others to protect users from 

harmful downloaded files.


You may simply drag and drop links to IDM, and drag and drop downloaded files out 

of Internet Download Manager.



IDM downloads all required files that are specified with filters from web sites, 

for example all pictures from a web site, or subsets of web sites, or complete web 

sites for offline browsing. It's possible to schedule multiple grabber projects to 

run them once at a specified time, stop them at a specified time, or run 

periodically to synchronize changes.
