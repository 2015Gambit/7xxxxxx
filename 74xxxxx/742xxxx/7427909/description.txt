Hack/Slash Series 1 Complete Run Issues #1 - #32 by DDP (Devils Due) from 2007.

All 32 issues here, the scans were optimized for tablet/netbook/notebook viewing but still look okay on regular size monitors.

The credit for the scans goes to the talent as noted in each scan, all I did was collect all 32 issues in one set for anyone who wants them in one shot instead of
piecemeal here and there.

Once again thanks to the talented scanners, editors and groups and creators who make this possible.

Seed, support and enjoy !
