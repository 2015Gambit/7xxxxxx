One of the finest female pop/rock albums of the early 70s, "Love Has Got Me" was the debut release of Wendy Waldman. Rolling Stone called it the "Singer-Songwriter Debut of the Year" and other critics were equally generous with their praise. Despite the critical reception and numerous artists covering her songs, Ms. Waldman simply failed to catch on. A few more albums for Warners followed before Ms. Waldman more or less slipped back into obscurity. Try this out and PLEASE seed for a while.
