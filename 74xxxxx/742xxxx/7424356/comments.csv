I looked and saw one person with 20 different Linking Park live Cd's (Memphis, Detroit, Texas, Berlin, London, some random island with no people) I did not want to bother with the live stuff aside from Live in Texas. I also did not want to bother compiling every remix out there, by LP or by some guy with a PC.
but it does have a big frickin folder of unreleased, remixes, bonus tracks, live, acoustic etc."

,insane_goofball,2012-07-08T17:35Z,"no problem at all. Any band requests ?

I apologize to everyone leeching, I realized I had not altered my settings earlier for upload bandwidth. I switched it to unlimited, not that I have the fastest speeds, but it seems to have helped. And, once I finish my other seeds and d/l's that should also increase this."
