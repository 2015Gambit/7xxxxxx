MSE flagged the keygen as a trojan but I'm confident it's a false positive.

Big thanks to Team XForce and a4ust!"
,snow_fox3000,2012-07-10T22:46Z,"Thanks!

It's Works Perfectly ^^"
,ctol9021,2012-07-13T02:58Z,I can get as far as the request code part but when I plug in the response code it says that it's an invalid activation code... help please?
,datalone,2012-07-13T09:27Z,"Make sure you're pasting in the entire Request Code, including the ""="" at the end. And make sure you've cleared out all of the pre-populated text in the Request field. Double-check steps #9 and #10 in the instructions."
,ctol9021,2012-07-13T23:05Z,"Yeah, I made sure everything is correct but when I plug it back into the Adobe installer it still says it's an invalid code. "
,biker1954,2012-07-14T18:13Z,"Finally a simple system that WORKS PERFECTLY!
Thank you very much!"
,biker1954,2012-07-14T18:23Z,"AWESOME . . . a simple system that works and updates PERFECTLY!

GREAT WORK . .  I admire you.

Thanks again!"
,datalone,2012-07-18T03:36Z,"@ctol9021, what's the Request Code you're trying to activate?"
,gdc4eva,2012-07-20T02:15Z,someone post the date that this last worked because its not working for me as of 7/19/2012

Today (21.07.2012) i've just made all i need.
It works."
,jrl545,2012-07-22T22:13Z,"I am having the same problem as cto.  I downloaded trial from adobe yesterday (7/22/12) and I am getting a ""Invalid Serial"" message.

The Request code I am receiving is: 7Sij oJfI Yr0k GU/2 seov lgQi STnL bCg0 eVLe Rudk axA=

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,stalker277,2012-07-24T02:25Z,"I couldn't get it running either... it says the same thing, response code is invalid. Didn't try it on the whole MC, just downloaded individual apps I needed. Maybe that's the problem? Anyone else downloaded only single apps and not the whole MC and got it working?"
,guibra,2012-07-25T20:02Z,Works perfectly. Thank you!
,stalker277,2012-07-25T21:07Z,"I can confirm, this works ONLY on the whole MC suite. It took the activation code from the first try, no problem.

I got no more bugs as I did with the cracked amtlib.dll, no app keeps the processor used while idling.

Anyway, it's kinds stupid for DW and FW to download 6GB of software, but at least it works!

Thanks X-force and to whoever shares their stuff!"

Is there 1 host file that can be removed in order to still connect to the adobe.com website, while still blocking phone-home?"

,TroublesumAngel,2012-08-06T16:44Z,"I cannot get the keygen to open, it keeps giving me an error about how it cannot access specified device, path, or file.

,bfo212,2012-08-08T21:19Z,"Great torrent, works perfectly.

Is there a host file that can be unblocked to allow access to the adobe homepage, but still have the apps not phone home?"
,hgtg,2012-08-09T09:47Z,"Just to let you know, this works with standalone Adobe product. The catch here is to use a serial number intended for the standalone product, DO NOT use a Master Collection serial for activate individual products.

Also you have to paste the serial in the keygen in the first field (it has to be present), then copy/paste the activation request, then generate the activation code.

Tried it on a standalone PS CS6. Hope this helps. :)"
,johnsoto,2012-08-13T20:24Z,"Been running AMC CS5.5 for about a year with no issues so thought I'd give CS6 a bash - all went OK with Dload and it accepted XForce generated licence and the request code worked a treat. I then pasted 'all' the script into the hosts file BUT did not remove the Adobe stuff already in there for fear of losing CS5.5...

The problem is that when I go into any CS6 prog I see 'Deactivate' is greyed out (which should not be) All works great offline but as soon as I re-connect to the internet and go into CS6 I get a message saying 'the licence you entered has been revoked, this product is not licensed' provide a serial number etc..

I see another post here for re-installing and recall on previous versions when a problem arose deleting all the 'amtlib.dll' files and starting to re-register again solved things.

Any suggestions would be appreciated on best way forward - cheers, John"

,Pvehard,2012-08-17T21:15Z,"No matter which Xforce keygen I download, all that is in the file once hte download is complete is a read me file. I can't even install Adobce cs6 if I can't find the keygen. Im not ignorant, there is just no keygen in any of these files when i download them..."
,oomegaoo,2012-08-23T13:26Z,^ Are you running Avast or an AV with a P2P shield? Avast deleted the eygen as soon as utorrent d/l it. You may have to disable your AV for a minute.
,miamk,2012-08-26T20:03Z,"After a successful installation, I noticed I can no longer access the adobe.com website... 

I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that we are blocking a number of adobe addresses in the hosts file.

Is there any workaround so that I can access adobe's site? "

I got a false positive in AVG. Seems legit. But still, you should always run apps like this in sandboxie!"
,outfaller,2012-09-06T22:43Z,"Just to expand on comment made by 

hgtg at 2012-08-09 09:47 CET:

took me some time to figure it out but here's what i did:

1. download trial for whatever standalone product you want
2.download the matching keygen from here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7142449/Adobe_Dreamweaver_CS5.5___Incl._keygen
(note the serial you used somewhere to be used later)
3.install the product using the serial generated from above torrent
4.when done installing, launch your chosen product and the x-force keygen.
paste the serial you used to install in the first field
paste activation request into the 2nd field and hit generate
use the generated code to activate
Simple!

block adobe from hosts files and you're done.

i did this just now and it worked though i can't say for how long."
,supersenz,2012-09-13T18:50Z,"hi outfaller.

I'm trying to do what you did but can't download the torrent you linked to: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7142449/Adobe_Dreamweaver_CS5.5___Incl._keygen

Any chance you can email me the keygen generator?"
