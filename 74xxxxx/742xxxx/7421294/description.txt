Release Information:

"1953 - KGB Unleashed" is based on real projects conducted by the
Ministry of State Security of the USSR (the former KGB). During that
time they pushed the limits of human endurance, testing for the
possibility of telepathy, as well as researching the psychological
impact of fear on the human brain. The photo-realistic visual style of
"1953 - KGB Unleashed" recreates the USSR of the fifties: the
underground shelter's interior is constructed using real Soviet military
plans, and the materials found there are based on historically valid
documents

Explore a hidden laboratory where such experiments were conducted in
order to learn the truth behind the terrifying events that led to the
closure of the project and the liquidation of its staff. An atmosphere
of isolation and suspense pervades throughout, bringing you face to
face with your own fears, while the voice of invisible "observer"
broadcasts over the internal communications system. Is this observer a
friend, or an enemy? Your exploration of this perfectly-preserved complex
may uncover what these experiments unlocked deep within the human psyche
but will you survive these revelations intact?
