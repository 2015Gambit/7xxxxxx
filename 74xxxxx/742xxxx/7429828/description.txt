"Top 9 Compete"

The remaining nine amateur cooks are faced 
with one of the most intimidating mystery box 
ingredients to date: "uni," otherwise known 
as sea urchin. In a surprising twist, the 
contestants must incorporate the spiky 
culinary delicacy into their creations, and 
the amateur cook who presents the most 
exceptional uni dish will earn a significant 
advantage in the next round. Later in the 
elimination challenge, the winner of the 
mystery box challenge will assign each of the 
remaining contestants one of eight different 
types of fish.
