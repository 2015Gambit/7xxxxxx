These are the four 1-hour specials that Nickelodeon aired in lieu of seasons 1 and 2. Some fans have been upset about the specials. Fine, but don't be blaming Nickelodeon. These Specials were not created by Nick, they were created by Rainbow, the Italian company who make winx, the creator of winx Iginio Straffi Directed these specials as well. So all the differences between the specials and series are not Nick's doing. everything from calling their basic form "Charmix" to using the later normal form outfits. Personally I liked the revisions made. that's what this is, a revision of earlier work. you see this all the time. How many times has the Star Wars series been re-edited and re-released. How many different remakes of various Superhero movies/shows have been created and re-created??

Anywho, these specials have made it easier for Nick to catch up to the rest of the world. I read a comment somewhere someone complaining that Nick should only be on Season 2 not Season 4. But why would you want to slowly sit through the entierty of those seasons over again?? Wouldn't you rather have season 5 the same time as the rest of the world?? o.O boy some people are crazy. Anywho, these are the four
reanimated abridged specials that re-tell Seasons 1&2 and get viewers prepared for later seasons. Enjoy.
