,IACSC,2012-07-09T18:42Z,"At some points in the movie the audio and video don't sync up. The audio has a lot of bass which scrambles about sometimes, needing you to possibly lower the volume a bit. No, it is not my speakers/headphones/etc. I've tried with numerous media players and the same results occur.
Even so, don't be mislead to believe this torrent isn't worth it. It truthfully is worth a go. I personally suggest it, and kudos to the uploader and/or recorder for being so prompt.

OT:
They probably could've used a different actress other than Emma Stone. They're kind of ""milking"" her dry as an actress and popular celebrity."

For some camcorder versions of movies you're satisfied with the results but for this particular recording, you're going to want to watch it again in a few months when it releases to DVD and BluRay if you're interested in hearing the dialogue, because you're going to struggle to hear what is being said throughout the entire movie. The first two and a half minutes feature absolutely no sound and before it kicks in I would suggest turning down your volume.

I noticed with the fight scenes that the sound would go out sync and it's very dark in many of the scenes, too. I tried turning up the brightness in the video player but this didn't help much. The movie seems good from what I was able to see and comprehend, but I wouldn't really rate it anything until you see it once more on something of a higher quality. It would make the movie much more enjoyable. "
,iMars666,2012-07-11T09:14Z,"READ: I don't say this often.. But Pay the money and go see this in theaters.. This is one of those rare movies that is actual worth paying the money for.

If you can not tolerate the CAM copies downloaded through torrents than just pay to see it in theaters.

Most theaters have cheaper tickets for shows before 5/6pm. Plus students get cheaper tickets.

Point being, support the great movies (ie Marvel related). Download the okay/shitty ones (ie Twilight)"

And there are always Matinee prices; movie shown during the day, and in some theaters all day Sunday cost less than movie shown at night. Here day time is $5-6 depending on theater and night showings are $9-11 (again depending on theater) Also there are Student discounts; Some schools don't have Student IDs - But there are sites that tell you how to make them; or http://www.homeschoolbuyersco-op.org/homeschool-id/ which you can just buy one for $7 - thats what I did for my girl since I'm a college student and she is not; Theaters here limit 1 ticket per student ID."

It's a good 1st attempt, but not all that great.

Doesn't seem like anyone else notice this upload was missing quite a few scenes at least 2 that a noticed watching about half the movie.

Audio was pretty bad.... couldn't hear what someone was saying in a few parts, the actions scenes were too loud making it reverberate and a few places the audio wasn't in sync with the movie.

I would wait until a better copy comes out that has the whole movie without missing scenes and better audio... But it's better then nothing if you can't wait to watch it."

That right there tells others your not a mature 32 year old at all. he prolly does go to see the movies in theaters, alone, in the corner of the room, or the cry box. But only uses this site to check out the big tits and half naked women in the ads on the side so he can masturbate to them cause his wife is one ugly son of a bitch. And he doesnt want to actually watch porn cause she checks his history and will make him sleep on the couch if she catches him for the 128th time.

Are you an idiot? This movie was just released and your asking when will there be a dvdrip? Have some common sense.

Btw, v=5, a = 1. No sound till the 2 minute 10 second mark."

A-0.5

The audio is distorted so it's really hard to hear the film. The audio doesn't actually start playing until two minutes into the film and about half an hour in some indian guy start's talking on the phone really loudly so you can't hear the film. The video quality is atrocious and it even cuts scenes out of the film. I have watched many CAM's in my life but this has to be the worst I have ever seen."

,legio9,2012-07-30T19:41Z,"Love the way people comment """"good for a cam"" , I wonder if they rate their lunch compared to dog shit too;  which I think, by the fact that they uploaded this, must love to eat ""tartar"".

No matter the ""source"", the END RESULT compared to something ""watchable"" of decent quality:  is a complete waste of bandwidth, an INSULT to technology and is thus rated by this unique neutral standard:

ALL versions as of this date (July 30th)

V: 1
A: 1"
,panikeke,2012-08-03T11:31Z,Don't waste your time. A: 0 V: 1. Unwatchable.
,ust2,2012-08-09T06:20Z,"@legio9
 -_- People rate it ""as a cam"" because that's what it is, a cam, and shouldn't really be rated any other way since you automatically expect lesser quality and they shouldn't be compared to DVD/BDrip quality because of that.

 If people were comparing their lunch to dog shit, they'd have to be eatting dog shit for their rating to make any contextual sense. Same goes for cams or basically whatever else people rate.."
,legio9,2012-08-10T01:29Z,"So ust2....by YOUR standard..the fact that ""it is a cam"" justify the crap quality? Are you INSANE? cause cam CAN do 500% better quality than ""this"".

Trying to find justification instead of rating a movie by its viewing quality (after all, aren't you downloading to watch it?) IS  comparing SHIT with other defecation...instead of comparing it with food.

Please start to view things as they really are: bad compared to worst is still bad; isn't time to aim for better? (which is very easy to obtain, btw.)
