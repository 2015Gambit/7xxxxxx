,Cyberron,2012-09-03T15:05Z,"Krazykarvs, Is there a way to turn off the sub titles. I don't know why every one that uploads the blue ray movies puts subtitles in them. I can understand some of them but every single one that puts High res movies on has subtitles. Especially  English speaking movies with English subtitles. I can understand having some subtitles for the hearing impaired but it would be nice to see a high re movie without subtitles. Can I get rid of them before downloading the movie. Thanks:
Cyberron :-) "
