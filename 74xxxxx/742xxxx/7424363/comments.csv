,rohit3221,2012-07-11T18:04Z,"Works great, Just paste the xpack2 folder inside the update folder of your bf3 installation, fire up origin, open my games, and right click on bf3->repair install. Origin will download a small update approx 90mb, and you are good to go...
Thx for the upload :-)"
,2Guys1Sandwich,2012-07-18T00:02Z,"Hey I followed rohits instructions and it doesnt work? I go on battlelog, try joining a CQ server but it only pops up with the 'to play on this server you need close quarters'. What do i do? Do i extract xpack2 first? Origin itself did repair install it but battlelog doesnt recognise my close quarters"
,SSRedBaron,2012-07-23T19:25Z,I also did everything rohit said and also tried some variations based on the first xpack on my own but still cant get it to work any help would be much appreciated (i have legit copy of bf3 le )

Have you guys purchased close quarters DLC?
You need to purchase it first.
I downloaded this torrent since origin sucks and it gave me problems while downloading close quarters...
Note- This Torrent contains the files that you need to download after you have purchased close quarters....If you haven't, then these files are useless for you."
