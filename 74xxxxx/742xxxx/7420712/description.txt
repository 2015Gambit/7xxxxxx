DESCRIPTION:

Way back before man abandoned the woods for the citiesΓÇöand traded his hunting rifle for a BlackBerryΓÇöhe had to know how to do certain things to survive. He had to trap and build and grow things, using his calloused hands and valuable knowledge passed down through the generations. For most men today, these once-cherished skills are as dead as the dodo. But take heart! Now guys can reconnect with those less-complicated times, rediscover how to embrace adventure, and appreciate the outdoor life. Denis Boyles, principal author of A Man's Life, has culled a wealth of essential, nearly lost manly endeavors from U.S. government pamphlets, century-old publications, and ancient scouting manuals to help re-educate us in the fine macho arts of:

* Tracking a bobcat 
* Splicing a rope 
* Rescuing someone from drowning 
* Sending a smoke signal 
* Building a log cabin 
And much, much, much moreΓÇöincluding, of course, how to catch a pig!
