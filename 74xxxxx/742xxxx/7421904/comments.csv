I can only dream of seeing this colour ""painted"" bird one day feed in my open back porch along with cardinals and jays as this would require very fast adaptation to make its habitat extend up to New England and Nouvelle France in my lifetime.

I once watched this documentary on TV titled ""Planet Wild - Hummingbird Sugar Rush"".  I would love to watch it again. Would you have any leads. :)"

The 1st season is presently showing in many languages all over the Rock. ""Check your local Animal Planet listings."""
