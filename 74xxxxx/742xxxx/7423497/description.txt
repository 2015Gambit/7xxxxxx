The Standard Handbook of Electronics Engineering has defined its field for over thirty years. Spun off in the 1960ΓÇÖs from FinkΓÇÖs Standard Handbook of Electrical Engineering, the Christiansen book has seen its markets grow rapidly, as electronic engineering and microelectronics became the growth engine of digital computing. The EE market has now undergone another seismic shiftΓÇöaway from computing and into communications and media. The Handbook will retain much of its evergreen basic material, but the key applications sections will now focus upon communications, networked media, and medicineΓÇöthe eventual destination of the majority of graduating EEs these days.
