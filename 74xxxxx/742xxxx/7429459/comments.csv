This is just a part of my comment:
I am patient but 4 KB/s average download speed (for days) is far too low."
,rhalls28,2012-07-13T04:20Z,I've already seeded one and a half part of the program. please seed it too and comment about the good torrent
,JohnMirror7,2012-07-13T07:03Z,"Wow only 1.5...
Since I have a life I erased the few percents that I had and moved on to a better source.
I realized it's far better to take the program and the driverpacks directly from their makers.
Thanks anyway."
