Hey TPB! This is a .avi DVD Rip of a 1953 3-D film, It Came From Outer Space. It is in 3-D, so you need those old-fashioned red and cyan glasses. This is an actual legit site where you can get them for free, http://free-3d-glasses.com/ . The only downside is it takes forever to get to your house, so you might be better off just buying them. Enjoy!

Ripped using WinX DVD Ripper Platinum in .avi format
