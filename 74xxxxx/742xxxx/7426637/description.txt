Summary: Eun-Yi (Kim Ha-Neul) works as an editor for a fashion magazine. She keeps failing in relationships with men, but doesnΓÇÖt get along with her colleagues. In-Ho (Jang Keun-Suk) was a promising ballet dancer. Two years ago he lifted a female dancer, but dropped her on accident. Because of this accident the woman was unable to dance any further and, now, In-Ho
wonΓÇÖt dance with women anymore.  The next evening, on a rainy night, Eun-Yi walks home and finds a large blue box on front of her home. When she looks inside of the box sheΓÇÖs shocked again to see the guy the from the other day, In-Ho, sitting in the box.  Oddly enough, In-Ho reminds Eun-Yi of her former pet dog Momo. Eun-Yi then comes up with an arrangement. She will let In-Ho stay at her apartment if he will become her pet dog named Momo.
