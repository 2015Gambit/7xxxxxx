,Ichigo0Soul,2012-07-10T08:23Z,"Plays fine in VLC, but for some reason, Media Player Classic in conjunction with K-Lite Mega Codec pack is unable to render the video. 

This is what it looks like when I try to play it: http://i.imgur.com/9hHYJ.jpg"
,KroganN7,2012-07-18T19:01Z,I want to thank you for uploading this. I would've downloaded the other torrent you have but I want to see the Anderson Silva fight along with the Forrest Griffin fight.
,KroganN7,2012-07-18T19:05Z,Download speed is 1.1 mb... Everyone has probably seen the fights by now but I will still seed when it's finished just in case :)
