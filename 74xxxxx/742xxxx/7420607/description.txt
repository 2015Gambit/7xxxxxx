Note: The scan quality is poor (though file size is large) maybe 100 dpi or less. OCR is not reliable at all and the text is barely readable at times. This is especially true when there is a lot of tensor notation. See sample below. Maybe we should LaTeX it! If anyone has access to a better link please post the link.
