Synopsis from Amazon:
The market leader for the full-year organic laboratory, this manual derives many experiments and procedures from the classic Feiser lab text, giving it an unsurpassed reputation for solid, authoritative content. The book includes new experiments that stress greener chemistry, updated NMR spectra, and a Premium Website that includes glassware-specific videos with pre-lab exercises. Offering a flexible mix of macroscale and microscale options for most experiments, this proven manual allows users to save on the purchase and disposal of expensive, sometimes hazardous organic chemicals. Macroscale versions can be used for less costly experiments, giving readers experience working with conventionally sized glassware.
