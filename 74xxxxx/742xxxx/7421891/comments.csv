,decrepit_dimarco,2012-07-12T23:36Z,"I always trust skidrow so its probably a false detect. Never the less I rather be safe than sorry. but my anti virus did not detect anything when scanning for virus. However on set up i get a detection: trojan horse inject.vt.dropper. Scary if its real, inject vt dropper means it records key board strokes and may steal valuable information. anyone also getting a detection???"
,kanasefe,2012-08-13T08:51Z,Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder into the game installation. How do i do that. I hope that it isnt a very stupid question. Please help.

,Pardinho,2012-08-26T19:29Z,"Didn`t worked. Guess its my computer.
It says APPCRASH, Reason: ntdll.dll
Got this same error trying to play AoE2. Some said that`s because the game do not support more than 8GB RAM."
,Pardinho,2012-08-28T16:56Z,"@Pardinho

Problem solved.
I just rebooted the machine and changed the ""steam.name="" in the SKIDROW autorun file.
My name was like ""Chicken Legs"" with space between words. I changed it to ""Pardinho"" with no space in the name. I guess that was the problem.
Can someone test?"
,kamilfranke,2012-08-29T21:03Z,"Don't download, has a virus inside. God, why there's no proper Endless Space up in Pirate Bay? This got viruses, the other one is missing some stupid bass.dll because of stupid custom music during installation."
