,nbrazil,2012-08-11T05:44Z,Each file being the exact same size is a bit suspicious.
,MamaGrell,2012-08-12T12:23Z,"im not trolling wtf!! im only telling the truth so people dont wast over 8gb for absolute crap :/ i admit i downloaded this because i love homestuck and was surprised that there maybe an anime for it but after seeing ""this"" i researched and reserched but there IS NOT an anime for homestuck!!

,Linknik,2012-09-14T23:02Z,"MamaGrell is just trying to troll you guys. Trust me, I am the mantainer of Homestuck Sound Test, which I repeatedly update with new tracks. This torrent is 100% legit. The HOmestuck anime has been in the works for a while and I'm excited by this collaboration between some of the greatest seiyuus and animation studios in anime history. Truly one of the eternal greats of anime, almost Studio Ghibli like quality if I do say so myself. THUMBS UP!"
