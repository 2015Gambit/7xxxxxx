,palcic,2012-07-22T19:30Z,"You were already warned (by other users) about deliberte mislabeling. 

This show had an exact number of episodes, and you didn't respect that (you were either one show earlier or you skipped one).

you are still not removing all the wrong labeled torrents (and you keep issuing double daily torrents as corrections).

you are not listing the files included (we want one real file, and not all the spam in other files). 

you don't deserve the TPB green skull anymore. sorry... 

Thanks to you and all others taking your torrents and reuploading them (making a total confusion), I'm abandoning watching this show (after 53 episodes).

There should be a link for reporting mislabeled torrents. "
