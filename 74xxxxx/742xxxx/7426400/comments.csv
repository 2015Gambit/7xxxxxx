I'm pretty shure that there's no compression on this DVD5."

,garycarradine,2012-07-10T06:16Z,thanks for this. may I make a request? :))
[T],Auge,2012-07-10T08:27Z,"Agentbay,
You are actually correct, now that I look at the size of the ISO this is uncompressed.
All of my compressed DVDs are 4.2 gigabytes, the fact that this one is smaller means that it started out smaller then 4.2.
Good catch."
