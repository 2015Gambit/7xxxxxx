It worked like charm."
,daveh65,2012-08-04T18:30Z,"Hi 1337chaos, I have just downloaded this torrent and wanted to delete the old file from my Nuvi 610, but my Garmin has only 415mb and the download is way larger. I have a micro sd card and an old Europe map that I don't use any more (2 gig), how do I put it onto the sd card. Many Thanks."

,panzerbunny,2012-08-16T16:25Z,"Hey folks just a heads up, ran into the issue with my Nuvi265W not recognizing the .img file on the SD card.  If you use an SD card, make a folder on it called ""garmin"" then put your gmapsupp.img or gmapprom.img file in that folder and you will see a green bar go across the screen on bootup if it's named correctly.  :)  "
