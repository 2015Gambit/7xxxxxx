Instructions:


1. Connect your device to the computer.

2. Go into the Garmin folder on the device and backup the file named gmapprom.img to your computer.

3. Delete the gmapprom.img┬¥ file from the GPS.

4. Copy the unlocked gmapsupp.img┬¥ file from this torrent into the Garmin folder on the device.

5. Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools>Settings>Map>Map Info.

If you have any problems using gmapsupp.img, try renaming it to gmapprom.img. I use a Nuvi 750 and haven't had any problems with it being named gmapsupp.img.

Also, this file will work from a SD card just as it is. Copy it to your SD card, put the card back into your GPS and follow step 5 above.
