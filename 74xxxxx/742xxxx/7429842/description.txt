Michael Winterbottom transposes the tragic    
tale of Thomas Hardy's 'Tess of the d'        
Urbervilles' to modern-day India in Trishna.  
Freida Pinto stars as Trishna, daughter of    
a rickshaw driver in a remote Indian village. 
When she takes a job at a nearby holiday      
resort, she meets and falls in love with      
rich young British businessman Jay. But       
despite their feelings for each other, their  
relationship must remain a secret due to the  
conflicting pressures of a rapidly changing   
society. Their problems seem to be solved     
when Jay takes Trishna to an exciting new     
world of dance, vibrant life and possibilities
in Mumbai. But Trishna harbours a dark secret 
that threatens the heart of their affair, and 
inequalities remain at the centre of their    
relationship that is beginning to unravel.
