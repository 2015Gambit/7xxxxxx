,Agent666,2012-07-14T15:33Z,"Windows 'hosts' file;
This will get you to the directory;
C:WindowsSystem32driversetc
or...
This will open the file, you can edit with Notepad;
C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts"

,enonumus,2012-07-17T15:53Z,"Wouldn't accept any of the serial #s as of 7/17, didn't matter whether or not the hosts file was modified, the results were the same for me every time.  I assume they invalidated all the serials in the readme file."
,noel_lee,2012-08-09T05:04Z,"works great..lifetime subscription active. just use the crack.paste it in the installed folder and replace the one it was there from before.i think,its a simple explanation :) any kid can follow."
,purestone,2012-08-27T02:40Z,Can we update it or should I leave update alone?
,purestone,2012-08-27T02:56Z,Anyone having problems updating?
,hulivar,2012-08-29T03:20Z,hmm kind of odd.  Basically heres what I did.  I installed this then it ran on it's own.  i wasn't sure what to do but updated it just for shit's and giggles.  Then I saw bottom right a link to activate so I restarted.  Then I put the crack exe in the install folder and restarted superantispyware.  It would appear everything is fine now.  The activation thing in the bottom right is gone...only thing is I guess I didn't even have to use a serial and the Uploader says you have to so....I dunno lol.  I just had to enter the 9 digit number on the original install.
,saint84,2012-09-11T17:21Z,"the crack does not work anymore and any of the serial provided with registration . so you can use the free version, but no the pro one "
