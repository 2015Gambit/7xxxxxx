,Neraforesta,2012-07-08T07:42Z,why 1.39 GiB for ONE fight? Sounds fishy too me..lol. i said fishy haha
,Neraforesta,2012-07-08T07:44Z,"Something tells me this is fake..since my last comment was deleted soo fast. 1.39gig for one fight, also tells me this is fake."
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T08:05Z,"Here's a gallery of screenshots for skeptics, even though you should all know I've never uploaded a single fake torrent in my life.

,baron096,2012-07-08T08:07Z,I'm giving it a shot... I'll let you know.
,vacario,2012-07-08T08:20Z,"can anyone confirm this is legit,or fake?"
,remster11,2012-07-08T08:35Z,I am 40% complete and previewed it in VLC. This is legit. 
,Rush,2012-07-08T08:36Z,"@SecTPB, how long before you can up the whole card?

Thanks, 
Rush...."
,Rush,2012-07-08T08:38Z,"Also previewed in VLC, real and good quality"
,Bakaat,2012-07-08T08:39Z,"If SecTPB went to the trouble to post or get pre/post fight pics, it's probably legit. If not, no one was hurt, maimed or killed during the downloading... so WTH? It IS a rather large file, but that's what you get when fights... LOL  Not too hard to figure out. ;)"
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T08:42Z,.
[T],jmz619,2012-07-08T08:46Z,1.3gigs for 1 fight because its 720p with 60fps it's legit.
,OutonaLimb,2012-07-08T09:00Z,I don't care how big files are I care about quality keep them coming I have 10 TB worth of drives who cares about space. Now speed I do like been when it comes to quality I will wait
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-07-08T09:04Z,"Thanks, well the screens, aint they spoilers?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T09:39Z,The images are just pre-fight images before the bout begins.
,Lovedcho,2012-07-08T09:49Z,"no screens aint spoiling anything, tho some motherfucker did earlier and ruined it for me :("
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T09:50Z,TPB comments are being dumb. Work!! :(
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T10:47Z,"File fully seeded out. 3,500 seeds and 9,021 peers right now. TPB is a bit inaccurate."
,rnaus2000,2012-07-08T11:08Z,AWESOME! THX U!
,wrkingclass_hero,2012-07-08T11:16Z,"Awesome quality, minus a few glitches that may have been on my end.  I always get fights at 60fps if they are available.  I look forward to getting the full event from you as well."
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T11:27Z,"The broadcast in the preliminaries and the PPV had quite a few glitches. The prelims were worse. I was watching them live and the audio was just horrid. There were lots of microphone issues, and the occasional skip in the video. They seemed to fix most of it by the time the PPV came around, but the mic problem struck again when Bruce was announcing the main event. His voice vanished. lol. Audio tech team screwed up big. And any video glitches were courtesy of UFC on Xbox Live. I am never ordering from Xbox Live again. This was my first time trying their stream. Not happy that it's the same price as the local PPV price and is lesser quality."

[T],SecTPB,2012-07-08T13:47Z,"My 720p is encoding. Won't start upload until Monday. If you prefer my files, it will be up Monday. I have to take care of True Blood first, which airs tomorrow(Sunday). "
,MoviesR101,2012-07-08T14:37Z,Thanks!
,AfroSox,2012-07-08T15:37Z,Wicked copy.. *Tips hat*.. 
,keri20,2012-07-08T16:49Z,wtf
,serrascheiffe,2012-07-08T18:51Z,There are some audio skips and visual glitches but the fight is there. Good fast download download. Thanks uploader.
,arrow123,2012-07-08T19:44Z,I spent all night downloading this over a slow 3g connection only to find out it is only the main event.  You couldn't have included that little detail in the title.  I just picked the most popular download and didn't read the description.  Thanks for uploading this but damn  the title sucks.
,Spazzbunny,2012-07-09T00:33Z,@arrow123 haha thats why you should always read the description if your unsure always check :) 
,KKKDownlow,2012-07-09T07:00Z,This was only the Anderson Silva match! Thanks for nothing you stupid asshole. Made me waste hours downloading one match for nothing.
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-10T01:08Z,"@KKKDownlow 
You're very respectful. You're welcome. Glad you appreciated the work it took to provide this by being a selfish asshole. Good job. Your reading skills are superior as well, as not only does the VERY FIRST LINE in the description say it's the main event only, but the first comment says the same thing. Learn to read and you won't waste time. If you want the PPV, then you want: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427285"
,KroganN7,2012-07-18T18:53Z,"It makes me sick to see how ignorant and rude people are. Does it really hurt to read the description, or at least the very first sentence? It isn't SecTPB's fault for your ignorance so don't get butthurt over your own mistake. By the way TecTPB, do you only upload in the Highres - TV section because this is my first encounter with you?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-25T21:56Z,"KroganN7
Sorry for the late reply, but about 95% of what I upload is in the High-Res section. I typically only do 720p and above, and depending on what it is I'm recording, try to upload the torrent at least 20 minutes after it finishes airing. "
,KihonKyu,2012-07-30T01:24Z,"Excellent! A=9.5, V=9.5"
,KroganN7,2012-07-30T19:01Z,"Okay, but what I meant was is it only in the TV section? No need to answer since I clicked on your name and found my answer haha. But thanks for the reply and keep up the great work. By the way sorry for my late reply lol."
