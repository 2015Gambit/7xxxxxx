[T],trialNerror,2012-07-07T07:54Z,"because these groups encode the tv shows while it's still airing. as it encodes it gets packed into rar files and those rar files are uploaded to servers. this way, if groups are racing, the shows can be completely encoded and uploaded within minutes after air.  you people seriously think the shows get encoded after it has aired? that's impossible when some releases are like 5 minutes after the show had aired. damn fools. seriously. p2p is full of retards.

people saying rar files are so gay and fuck the uploaders for using them... well fuck those whining jerks for being so damn dumb and not knowing anything about how it all works.

oh and if you guys didn't know this, torrents are the bottom of the chain. this stuff is available on other sites way before it gets made into a torrent.  be less bitchy and be more thankful you even get it here."
