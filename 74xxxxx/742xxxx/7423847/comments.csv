Confirmed this works for FSX? I have been looking all over for an up-to-date version of this that works."
,whtvr2,2012-07-08T15:16Z,"WJSS12, already uploaded. How do you manage to not find it?

,aarque,2012-07-08T18:34Z,"Be courteous  enough to run a search before you upload files. 

You disrespect the original uploader by stealing leeches and seeders. Ultimately, both torrents become weakened as new leeches do not know which to populate. 

If there is something special about this torrent, describe how it supersedes the previous torrent in the torrent description.
 When people ask for something, they will usually say if they have searched already. If they don't bother to search, why spoon feed and perpetuate ignorance?

1. this add-on works
2. this add-on has liveries included (as you can see, there's a difference in size)
3.  I'm downloading torrents from other websites and then upload them here. I downloaded the add-on back in 2011 from a non-torrent website...no torrent)
4. there are 20 billion torrents that contain the same thing on TPB. Am I occupying your space or you simply have a problem with me cause I'm new?

PS - it's not my fault nobody is downloading your torrents and now you're pissed and taking it on me."
,George114,2012-07-08T19:05Z,"""I'm NOT downloading torrents...""

I'm glad an edit button ""is available"""
,whtvr2,2012-07-08T20:01Z,"George114, it's fine. 
Liveries just increased the filesize unnecessarily and can be downloaded normally. Which is why I didn't include it. Otherwise it is exactly the same.

Anyway, I did forget to include fs2004 tag and I'd say this torrent should just replace mine. If you have anymore privately shared files that aren't here, please do share it. Thanks."
,aarque,2012-07-09T05:32Z,"Ya, by all means share new content, but I don't give a flying fuck if people download my stuff. I 'load all original content, one or two files unique to my friends here at TPB...I have no problem if you are new, I welcome fresh blood. It is my hope you make sense of my comments and help the site appropriately.

and whtvr2 it is EASY to have your torrent killed if you want. Just register at Suprbay and post here, I've done it a few times when I screwed up the trackers or whatever:

,Mutton,2012-07-10T09:37Z,"@George114 -

Yes, there are many torrents on TPB containing duplicate content. This is exactly aarque's point. Duplication of content means that the swarm is divided, rather than consolidated. For the end-user (downloaders/leeches), this means that there is less bandwidth available to serve each torrent, resulting in a slower download. In terms of software engineering, this is what is termed as a bad ""user experience"".

The way to /improve/ the user experience is to /not/ upload torrents containing duplicate content, resulting in swarm consolidation and faster transfer speeds.

Ultimately, you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but that doesn't mean that you're doing the right thing at all, at all."

,zaib786,2012-09-14T23:19Z,"Why do you download if you can't freakin experiment using different ways :o(
-----------------------------------------------------
This is correct procedure to execute this setup:
1. Run the Maddog setup and let it install.
2. Copy and paste the crack into your main fs9
    or fsx folder, run it and click on patch (Most
    people click patch and don't let it does it's
    work,
________________________________
wait untill  you see all files patched OK
________________________________
3. Now run the Load Manager and then Enter the
    user name and serials in the last tab of load
    manager window, George114 has given it
    already.
Hope this would work, it worked for me like charms with no post issues :o)"
