when a ratio limit was reached..

some people never learn! so it took 4-5 hours to seed out
instead of the 1-2hrs it normally would.. so it punished everyone
not just the leechers and upload speed limiters

all seeded out now.. so should have a issue getting it fast
since many are helping seed it"
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-08T07:22Z,Thanks it downloaded very fast! I seed everything 1:1 or more because my net is unlimited ;) 
,carrigart140,2012-07-09T19:35Z,Love shows like this thank you
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-11T18:52Z,OK this show really sucks. I was hoping it would get better but doesn't look like it will. I heard about this show when James Fox on Coast 2 Coast AM. The thing is though if a UFO investigation show is too good like the the UFO Hunters it will be taken off the air. I so miss the UFO Hunters :(
[V],psspss,2012-07-12T09:06Z,"i think you have to give it a chance...

but they do seem to not take it very seriously and
scream and yell and laugh alot.. its like watching a school outing with excited kids.

they need to loose ryder 

fact or faked prob do better investigations and
capture some good ufos themselves that are
hard to dismiss

but I think also the editing is made by nat geo
to make fun of it or include the messing about scenes over the better stuff"
