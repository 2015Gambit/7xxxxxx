Compilations:

Not An Album, Just Songs:

This is a compilation of songs that Nate Lacey (frontman of Mimicking Birds) wrote and recorded on his own with his own equipment. It was made available through the internet but has since been removed. There are 16 tracks.

Demos:
These are earlier recordings/demos of the songs on the debut album "Mimicking Birds", but it does not include two songs from the album.


I know the quality isn't excellent if you're an audiophile, but the tracks still sound great; I scavenged the net for this music and this was as good of quality as it gets. As far as I know this is the first torrent to include these songs.

I hope to get this band a little more publicity, and to bring this music to more fans and to-be-fans. This is a tremendous band with a truly talented song-writer.
