,babybluetits24,2012-07-09T18:51Z,"imdb says Language:
English | French | Italian (some dialogue) so will we need subs ???"
[V],scene4all,2012-07-09T20:17Z,Subs are hardcoded when need.
,XONi49,2012-07-09T20:56Z,boring movie if i wanted to see two girls fighting over stupid shit for 1 hour and a half i could go in to a strip club and throw money on the ground at least that would be more entertaining 
,EliteBeast,2012-07-11T06:10Z,"So much french you have to read the subtitles, If I felt like reading I would read a book but I want to watch a movie. And I expect a Chris Rock movie to be funny but this wasn't. Audio/Video 9 Movie 3"
,Zenophobe,2012-07-11T12:47Z,"how the hell does Julie Delpy and Chris Rock get packaged in a movie together...  plus I didn't know that the 1st movie with Adam Goldberg even made their production costs back to warrant a sequel

with that said, i will still download this haha...  thank you scene4all"

,Tallyortoby,2012-07-12T10:58Z,"@Zenophobe: the 1st movie was quite well received in Europe, specially France ( as there was a lot of french speaking in it), so this should do well as well. They were on french tv during the news to make the promotion. Doesn't always have to work in the US to be a success :)"

,GreenPianist,2012-07-25T06:31Z,"Are you guys kidding me ? This is one of the funniest movies Ive seen this year!
Its the kind of original intelligent and sarcastic humor we don't normally see in other american movies that makes this movie special, the dialogues were great.

If you find this movie boring and can't understand it's essence I have bad news for you.. it's you who probably are boring."
