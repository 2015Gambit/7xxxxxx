,DreaD151,2012-07-09T14:42Z,"once again people are failing to see what long term users of pb have known for ages froggie100 has a skull that means no virus and best that froggie can RECIEVE they just get the videos TRY and clean em up and make a torrent so the rest of us can SAVE a buck or two from going to the theater to watch this..... ""you do the best with the hand dealt to you"" thats why there are 300 torrents of the same movie cause only a  few russians,middle easterns, or western people who go into theaters to record this. it gets really hard when you have a security guard walking around in the theater with a flashlight looking a movie tickets at every show all the time  to catch pirates....."

,ManuelRivero,2012-07-18T20:55Z,"Seems to be the best CAM mash up available so far.
Almost no blended frames, flicker pretty well filtered I guess.

V-6/10 for a CAM
A-2/10 for a CAM

Blended frames: 9/10
Flicker: 7/10
Dark scenes: 7/10
Camera steadiness: 8/10 (cam adjusted at beginning and halfway through movie)
Viewable screen: 65%? (OMETHEU lol)
Focus: 5/10. Auto focus is on and picture is a bit blurry for 720p cam, maybe if it was H264 instead of XVID it would be less blurry!
Speech clearness: 3/10 (I recommend viewing with subs), doubt it's a line since you can hear people speaking."
