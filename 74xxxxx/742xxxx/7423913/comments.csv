I've always admired your software 'kits' - very conveniently packaged scene releases.  Doesn't the general lack of comments on this musical fare tell you anything.  But then again, it is your time.

Most users prefer high quality MP3 files over FLAC as they are more ""reasonable"" in size.
If you wish to have a specific release in FLAC format all you have to do is request it and we shall release it in FLAC format."
