Crack courtesy of LineZer0

Do not block with Little Snitch to allow updates. I was unable to test multiplayer. I don't know if I missed something or it is not available with the crack.

I found this second hand with no instructions and will try to help with the steps I used. The instructions are a little tricky and you will need to use the crack twice. Make sure you don't delete crack.zip when unzipping! Because you will need it after updates and will need to repeat steps 9-11 every update.

1. Install Driver San Francisco
2. Unzip crack.zip and you will get UbisoftGameLauncher
3. Navigate to /Applications/Ubisoft/Driver San Francisco/Driver San Francisco.app
4. Right click on Driver San Francisco.app to show contents and navigate to Contents
5. Right click on Ubisoft Game Launcher.app
6. Navigate to /Contents/MacOS/
7. Replace UbisoftGameLauncher with cracked UbisoftGameLauncher
8. Launch game and allow it to update. Then exit game and launcher.
9. Navigate to /Library/Application Support/Ubisoft/
10. Right click on Ubisoft Game Launcher.app to show contents and navigate to /Contents/MacOS/
11. Replace UbisoftGameLauncher with cracked UbisoftGameLauncher

Launch game and play!

Additional requirement
 - You will have to register a free account with uPlay/UbiSoft to use with the game when you login. The Register Now button is in the launcher window when asked for your name and password.
