,FastForwarder,2012-07-07T14:10Z,ttford a bit late is putting it mildly. The Blade already cracked this months ago. LameZer0 must be desperate for attention again.
,mkdhdh,2012-07-07T14:28Z,crack didnt work for me... link to the blade crack please?
,RQ7,2012-07-07T22:08Z,"When im in Aplication Support, there's no Ubisoft Game Launcher.app or something.. but there's a Ubisoft Game Launcher folder and nothing much is in there, any help?"
,RQ7,2012-07-07T22:21Z,"WHY ARE YOU DELETING MY COMMENT !!

( There's no Ubisoft Game Launcher.app in Application Support, this guy is lying and that's why he's deleting my comment )"
,mkdhdh,2012-07-08T14:17Z,"game doesnt even start without crack the ""driver san fransisco has stopped working"" pops up

,enosjohnk,2012-07-08T19:42Z,"I did everything instructed here.. after installation I replaced the gamelauncher crack in the contents/macos/ubisoft folder. When I open the game it says ""Failed to load configuration. Please restart the game. If the error persists please contact Ubisoft support.""
This error shows up when it starts the update process! HELP!!!!!"
,mkdhdh,2012-07-10T12:34Z,"there is no way of getting this to work i think... i tried everything the game wont even do anything when i dont crack it... without anything popping up it directly goes to ""driver san fransisco has stopped working"""
,bigramey52,2012-07-10T15:08Z,"This work perfect!! @RQ7 if you open your macintosh hd there you will find/Library/Application Support/Ubisoft/. 

Follow the all the instructions and make a free profile and it works 100%

(running mid-2011 i5 iMac)"
,RQ7,2012-07-10T21:33Z,"@bigramey52 I understand but look, the thing is in Application Support folder, I can not find Ubisoft folder at all, that's my problem bro"
,bigramey52,2012-07-10T22:51Z,"if its not in there then you did not crack the game and run at first and let it update. will not show up until that point. 

If you opened game with out crack and let update you will need to remove game and do again. Following 1-11 and it will work fine. 

Been playing most of afternoon with no problems (an no online multiplayer of course) "
,RQ7,2012-07-11T00:16Z,"@bigramey52 I've done all the steps but... screw that, do you know how to uninstall DSF?"

,LoveLyricalRideX,2012-07-31T08:04Z,"@thenoobish,

Hi can somebody tell me how can I reinstall Driver San Francisco on my MacBook Pro 13"" (2011)

I'd installed it using the wrong method, so I deleted it from the applications folder.

I have tried to reinstall and re-download Driver San Francisco again and again.

And the message keep saying this:
""Driver San Francisco is already installed on your system. Please run uninstall script and launch installer again to reinstall the game.""

Please Can Someone help me to solve this problem issue. Thank's! :)"

1. Go to Macintosh HD -> Library -> Preferences.
2. Delete 2 files:
i) com.ubisoft.DriverSanFrancisco­.GameUpdate.plist
ii) com.Ubisoft.Launcher.plist
You should be able to reinstall after deleting﻿ this."
,MissPotato,2012-08-07T08:58Z,you won't find the /ubisoft/ folder in (yourname)/library/application support!! you have to go to macintosh hd/library/application support and there you'll find the ubisoft folder
