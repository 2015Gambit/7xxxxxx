Description: A vivid compilation of rare and unreleased material, live performances, archival interviews and studio / television footage, History, Hits & Highlights chronicles the years 1968-1976 when the band survived four line-up changes and produced such classic albums as In Rock , Fireball, Burn, and Machine Head. It was at this time that essential tracks like "Hush," "Speed ΓÇïΓÇïKing," "Black Night," and, of course, "Smoke On The Water," were produced. These solid rock staples, plus many more, are prominently displayed on this set. As a bonus, a photo gallery is included on the second disc.
