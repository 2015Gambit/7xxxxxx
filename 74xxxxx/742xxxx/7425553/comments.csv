thank you"
,paffnucy1,2012-07-09T15:37Z,"Works like a charm, thanks! :)

But why not use JeppFD?"
,precursor1188,2012-07-09T16:08Z,"Thank You
I am guessing that airbusflyer is saying that he does not use FD."
,airbusflyer,2012-07-09T17:16Z,"@usapilot
it's for both...that's why I called it [Ipad]!
@paffnucy1
it uses much space and I don't need it for me. For charts I have the TC app and for my route I can also use charts :P
@precursor1188
correct :D"
,usapilot,2012-07-09T17:53Z,"Thank you very much, i guess is the Rev 1214, right, 

or is the 1204?

thanks"
,airbusflyer,2012-07-09T18:39Z,"@usapilot
you mean there was a revision of the actual data? If yes so I think it's the original which was published direct on release date. Got this from a friend as a kind of ""present"" ;)
But I think for us it's okay. Maybe you have to wait for the PC Version to get the Revision of there was one. With the PC data you can also update the Charts for the TC app."

,kingflyer,2012-07-11T19:25Z,how can I upload the cycle 1214 for pc? i have the disk and the codes but every time I try to upload the server is not found. Any ideas?

,JWRBlack,2012-07-17T20:18Z,"PC users: 
You can use files from the IPAD version to partially update the PC version.
Out of the latest IPAD update take the files airports.dbf, charts.ini charts.bin (-Documents-Data-Termcharts).
Rename airports.dbf to Airports.dbf and charts.bin to Charts.bin.
Copy these 3 files to your Jeppesen-Common-TerminalCharts folder on your PC to replace the older versions.
This will update the terminal charts to the current version while we wait for the full PC update. "
,usapilot,2012-07-20T13:03Z,Please upload REV 1215 thank you
,B747800,2012-07-22T07:50Z,"GREAT! Thank you!

Any ideas though where we could find activation codes for the ipad app? I mean to avoid the demo opening screen.

Cheers "
,airbusflyer,2012-07-24T07:36Z,"@B747800
this is not possible cauze Ipad is having a nearly permanent internet connection and would check that immediate. So your code, if someone will give it, will maybe last a few minutes.
But you don't need a code and the activation screen is not disturbing. You could have it worther ;)

@all
Just saw that I wrote 1204...but of course it was 1214 :P Damn... usapilot was right. Sorry for that.

Lets hope someone can post 1215 or 1216 (next cycle in 2 weeks)"
