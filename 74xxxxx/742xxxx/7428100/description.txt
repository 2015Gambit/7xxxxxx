LIBERACE
Live In Las Vegas Hilton
VALENTINES DAY
 
With guest star Sandy Duncan and special guest star Lola Folana
 
Mr Showmanship throws a glittering party that is sure to win everyone's heart - it is the most outrageous musical Valentine's Day celebration ever!  Liberace arrives by hot air balloon at the Las Vegas Hilton for his Valentine spectacular.  After introducing his guest stars Lola Folana and Sandy Duncan, he begins the show with My Funny Valentine beautifully blended with Chopin's Nocturne in E Flat, A Gershwin Medley, Lover, accompanied by the five hundred thousand gallon fountains of The Dancing Waters followed by a whimsical version of Night and Day that features Lola and Sandy in their debuts as concert pianists while Liberace conducts the orchestra.
 
After the show Liberace takes a side trip to The Liberace Museum where he shows off its collection of rare pianos and cars.  Then it?s off for a quick tour of his eye popping home before leaving for his Valentine Gala.
 
Drenched in furs and diamonds, it's Liberace who dominates the proceedings with his Valentine sentiments, his medley dedicated to his mother, the sheer happiness he excludes and the pure showmanship which turns the Queen May into a private yacht, the Las Vegas Hilton into his private domain.

Quality is average but to be expected for 1978. I suspect it's a DVD copy of a VHS. Either way, it's damn impossible to find these days, so I hope you like it.
