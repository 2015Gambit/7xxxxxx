DESCRIPTION:

The building of the American Army during WWII, from a tiny, outdated and ill-equipped force, into one of the mightiest armies in the world was rightly described by Sir Winston Churchill as being a "prodigy of organization." 
Its value to the Allied cause was immeasurable and it had a fine fighting record all over the world. It was a marvelously well-equipped army, thanks to American inventiveness, know-how, and technical prowess, and by 1945 it lead the world in weaponry, strategic mobility and logistic capabilities. 
US Army Handbook 1939-1945 is fully illustrated with a varied and exciting selection of contemporary action photographs.
