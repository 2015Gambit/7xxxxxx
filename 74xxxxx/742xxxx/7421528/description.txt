PearlyWhites is a NEW Adobe┬« Photoshop┬« compatible Plug-In filter that automatically whitens and brightens teeth. Digital cameras are known to add a yellow cast to teeth. PearlyWhites automatically restores teeth to gleaming white. PearlyWhites may also whiten the sclera of the eye as it looks for white elements when surrounded by flesh tones.
PearlyWhites can be run on individual images or be combined with other Image Trends Plug-Ins in a Photoshop Action and applied to a set of images in batch mode.
