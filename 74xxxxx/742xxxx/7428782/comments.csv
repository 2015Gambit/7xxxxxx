Now on to the content.....

I am absolutely STUNNED that this book is so popular..... wtf is wrong with people?!?!? If you don't believe me go read the amazon reviews for it.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND BRAIN READING THIS GARBAGE BOOK. There are MUCH better erotica books out there.

The book feels like it was written for and by an immature, young, sheltered little girl. The main female character gets angeringly annoying.. she seems to have the emotional and intelligence level of a 3 year old."

But: This is insufferable bullshit... There is good literature out there, this is NOT it!

But: Tnx for the effort!!!"
