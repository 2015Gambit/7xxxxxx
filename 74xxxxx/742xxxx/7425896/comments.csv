,obvious2me,2012-07-09T06:31Z,"I don't think you guys get it... The upload is only a few hours old; if you're resorting to torrenting you're likely to not be in a favorable income situation (likely which means there is a good chance, not 100%, but relatively near it). Lower income = lesser internet connection = lesser dl rate etc etc.

At my max dl speed it would take about about 1.5 hours to download this, which is above average for a north american living in the 'sticks'.

Just use some logic people; most downloaders aren't even in the position to seed, and if they were screaming for them to seed in a comment section of a webpage of a video they've already downloaded isn't going to change anything."
,teamdx,2012-07-09T06:58Z,Finally in english. Holy fucking fuck nation!
,xxbeanxx,2012-07-09T07:12Z,thanks for the upload ive been waiting for a english version since it came out .  I will rate after its done downloading i can already see theres rateing comments but more peoples opinions help others make a better informed decision and i will seed for 2 days.

,Fantomnz,2012-07-09T12:53Z,"@obvious2me

I have to agree & diagree, Agree that when a torrent is a few hours old everybody is sharing every BIT back in forth, thats what most don't understand, until the torrent becomes should we say for a easy term Stable! As far as in a favarable position country makes a bit of a diff for some Im in The Long White Cloud & Meant to have Broadband LOL is all I can say & it cost the left nut & a kidney!!! Lol true per month!!! 
So agreed most arnt hit & runners they are like the rest of you wanting to share but only when there downloading...... Most & that would be a very highy volume wouldnt even know what there doing excepct for getting a DL!!! I can quite excuse them they know not what they do..but the ones that leech with no seeding champ my ass!!!!! I pay in the long run for what I get. I Seed as Im downloading which at times can be 1:1 but is mostly 1:2 maybe 1:3 but atleast I seed. People just have to understand until its revolving threw lots of DL-UPL it will be slow!!!! 
Hey even on a awsome day for me stable torrent say a 1.3GB DL I get 35mins approx & thats really good for NZ.

it's not some flocking 'password' crap.  Do these
idiots think I'll give out my email/ph#/street

that 99 times out of 100 isn't even the movie
stated, let alone if it even was.  I'll d/load the
stuff, but exit, stage left, over that crap.

Maybe we need to start posting, somewhere,
the 'passwords'.  Yeah, THAT's da ticket.

Kudos to ALL who torrent for real, and seed..

V:7"
,obvious2me,2012-07-10T07:41Z,"Yeah...

A: 1
V: 5

I dropped the base settings on my sub, cranked treb.
Did the same for the receiver and for VLC. Nothing makes this cam watchable.

Hopefully someone uploads a cam with better than shitty sound, otherwise waiting for dvd."
