Burned from: iTunes on a CD
Ripped from: CD to Media Go, then copied to another folder so it prevents a conflict with Bittorrent (just being safe and trying to prevent it from erroring)

Hopefully if anyone downloads this one it shows up properly in the media library.

I got one as a download in a torrent of Final Fantasy albums, but when media go was looking for it's info it placed it under Final Fantasy VII and also I think some of those songs were tagged wrong because I see none of what ended up tagged as 'reunion tracks' in that batch are in the above list.
