Description

Strife is an action-packed blend of FPS action with RPG elements, featuring an original, engaging story.

After a comet strikes the earth wiping out most of the human race, a fanatical religious cult named "The Order" has taken complete control of the world. Plagues, famine, wars and other disasters have followed in the steps of this organization and a rebel group calling themselves the Front has been formed against the oppressive rulers. This is were you come in.

You are a wandering mercenary, visiting Tarnhill by rumors of heavy fighting between The Order and The Front. While searching for The Front you decided to take a brief rest somewhere that you thought was safe. The Order acolytes have been rounding up all suspicious characters in the area. Yes, you happen to be one of them.

Fight against the resistance or side with The Order overlords, or work alone. Change the course of humanity, by destroying the alien overlords, or bring about the end of the human race.
