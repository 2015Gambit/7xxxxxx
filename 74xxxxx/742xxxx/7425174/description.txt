This is an ISO image of an old VHS tape, titled: 2131- Cal's Moment in Time.  It's the footage and commentary of Cal Ripken Jr.'s 2130 and 2131 consecutive games played streak.  There are a ton of baseball dignitaries and Hall of Famers who show up to congratulate Cal including Hank Aaron and Joe DiMaggio.  The quality is very good.  Enjoy!
