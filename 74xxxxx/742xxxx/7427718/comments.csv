,GoodGuyBob,2012-07-26T19:41Z,"=HOW TO DELETE KATY PERRY'S SWEET TREATS=

Finally I managed it - just created an account to write this - hope it helps.

(Windows XP)

1. For your own safety reinstall this release completely
2. Go to your Start Menu and click on Run (i'm using non-english os so it may be labeled differently) and type 'regedit'. Then highlight ""My Computer"" on the left side of the Registry Editor by clicking on it (this way it scans whole registry from top to bottom)
3. In the Regedit taskbar go to Edit -> Find
and type there 'katy perry'
4. Press 'Find' and delete whole folders (on the left side of the window) it finds with Katy Perry content except the DefaultIcon and Command ones.
5. After that keep pressing F3 on your keyboard to find the next entries and delete delete delete
6. Delete Katy Perry Sweet Treat's folder from your installation location (where the rest of expansion packs are)
7. Launch the game using TS3W.exe found in the main game directory (The Sims 3GameBin)
8. Play without this stupid crap = Enjoy!"
,bluish26,2012-07-27T03:02Z,Sorry if this sounds silly to you but can anyone helps me... how do you enable the DLCs if you are using mac? Thank you 
,Madagarfo,2012-07-27T04:05Z,"PLEASE,
Im having a strange trouble here: the game worked perfectly, and everything (but the seeds) are fine. BUT, TS3-Pets is running with a lot of errors, and animals aren't shown as animals, but like aliens. Anything know how to fix it, or even, how to uninstall ONLY the Pets expansion? Thank you guys!"
,9V9,2012-07-27T08:04Z,"Ok I don't want to bash Black Box's repack, but the instructions don't quite explain the order in which the DLC must be installed. I tried installing the buildings first (ok) Then i moved and installed the sims pack folder (ok) then came folder v1 (somewhat ok) and v2, now in the objects panel there is a conflicting object, when you install that one it fucks everything else up so when you exit the launcher it's almost like its not installed. Whats the deal any help? and how about a new super nude patch version?"
,Ricky1794,2012-07-27T10:36Z,"Hey does anyone know how to add custom music? I don't think there's an actual ""Custom Music"" folder or if there is I just can't find it. If somebody could help me would this that would be great."
,Ricky1794,2012-07-27T10:37Z,"Oh and to anyone Having trouble installing the DLCS. it says at the bottom of the info that they're already installed. it is kinda confusing but yeah, now you know."
,9V9,2012-07-27T11:18Z,"@Ricky1894  What?? They are not installed until you use the game launcher.....what?!
The answer to your question about custom music, check your My Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Custom music folder, drag and drop your mp3's in there and then go to in game options on the sound and music tab and search and enable them there?"
,Ricky1794,2012-07-28T00:41Z,"@9V9
Ahhhh ok Thanks, I had the Ea games>custom music thing down but I wasn't looking in my documents. And well mine were already installed when I started playing. I didn't have to do anything extra after I initially installed it. "

thank you so much for uploading this i have been waiting for a Sims 3  blackbox for a very long time

It only took 9 hours to download considering that their are 12 games in it so it didn't bother me at all! I knew to start it early in the morning so it would be done at night when i'm actually bored at home with nothing to do.Very simple to install thought i was going to have to copy and replace files and i didn't! this is a must have and i would recommend anyone who plays the Sims"

,Shiva64,2012-08-11T01:45Z,"@vnkrn: if you couldn't tell, it says it's for PC. therefore, not Mac compatible. as far as i know, most of blackbox's stuff removes all the Mac stuff to help make it a smaller file (i don't know if they've ever included mac files, but all the ones i've downloaded don't have them).

you're gonna have to look for a mac compatible torrent."

,badjrod,2012-09-09T13:51Z,"How do you install the Supernatural expansion with this? I've tried updating the base game to no avail and then the Supernatural expansion tries to update, fails, and then the base game Sims 3 is broken afterwards and I gotta do system restore to get it back.  How can you install the new expansion on this?"
