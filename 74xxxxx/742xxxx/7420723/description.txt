Happy viewing!
 

It was kind of an anti-climatic finish to this year's Triple Crown (2012).  But it was still good to see Union Rags win at the stretch.  For a horse that was sold and bought back at three times the cost, he certainly brought in a nice payday for his owners and brought big smiles all around the track.




Enjoy!
