(Couldn't upload this to the movies category because it's too small, but then again it isn't the whole movie so I guess it's all fair.)

PLEASE READ FIRST, COMMENTS ASKING QUESTIONS ANSWERED HERE WILL BE IGNORED:

I don't know how well this is going to go down (cue "Why isn't this the whole movie? You suck!" comments) but I decided to try and sync some English audio I got of this film (recorded with a microphone, not line audio or anything) to some camera footage already available. Unfortunately I only got the second half of the movie's audio recorded, but I guess you could use this copy to remissness on scenes you saw when you went to see this film in the cinema. It starts about an hour in.

I used two different sources in this, one is most of the footage, but it had some small scenes missing so I used another copy to replace them. The other version still didn't have all of what I needed to fill in the blank in a spot, so there's a few minutes of a black screen at once point. Thought I might as well keep the audio so you can hear it anyway! The second source I used was way too dark so I put the brightness/contrast up a bit, but the footage for the whole video is still kinda bad. I can tell what's going on but I saw it in the cinema, YMMV. Most of the footage is unedited.

I also re-compressed it into a H.264/AAC and got it quite small as the original footage isn't very high quality to begin with.

I mainly put this up to see what people thought of my attempt at what I did. If you do like it, tell me and I may be able to do the whole thing, although I imagine someone else will get there before me. I actually think there's one up right now that is the whole film, but I have yet to finish downloading it to find out.
