Its great if you and zeegertje could cooperate with each other, we could get some great Ups from that :-)
It would make a great team"
,zeegertje,2012-07-08T16:40Z,"@Lindoffs, thanks, I look forwards to them, I down a version of Living Free from this site right now, it's a bit slow, but i hope that i can get it....and i hope to find a english srt, that makes translating a bit easier.
But anyway, the originals are always the best of course!"
[V],Lindoffs,2012-07-08T17:57Z,"@Saggin: Interesting constellation! A Swede and a Dutch co-operating... I'll buy that. If just ""zeegertje"" can come in on Demonoid. Then we can work something out. I do some subtitling in Greek on Dem.. for a couple of friends there. As you probsbly hsve seen I even do real DVD's with menues and stuff. It's done in the old fashion way without wizards and stuff like that. I've been working with this for 15 years and in the old times I worked with VHS. Mostly for W&B and a very big Jap company, starting on ""S"". We'll see what's happening...

,zeegertje,2012-07-08T22:27Z,"Yes, i come there sometimes, and i'll tried to find you there, maar i really can't remember my nickname, password and wich email adress i use there..... i'm so sorry:$
But I have a user registration, from long time ago... tomorrow I will try again."
,zeegertje,2012-07-09T11:55Z,"okay, I logged in on Dem.. (name zeegertje)
