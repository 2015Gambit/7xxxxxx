Any kind of upper garment with opening: jackets, cardigans, coats, vests, boleros, shrugs. Done with crochet. 
Books, booklets and individual patterns, collected from the web or (in picture form) taken from magazines. Renamed for consistency, pruned of duplicates, reordered pages where they were messed up and, where the scan was bad, carefully photoshopped (crop, straighten, levels of black and white fixed, scratches and stains removed etc...)

NOTE:I can only seed at night and I'm in Europe.
