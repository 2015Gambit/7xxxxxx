Taking the closing slot is a band who've cemented their position as one of the 
most bankable on the festival circuit. They've got lots of very big tunes and 
they know how to use them.

But it's not all about monster riffs and swagger. They have plenty of psychedelic 
twists to their sound and with each release seem to grow a little weirder, 
by which we mean better.
