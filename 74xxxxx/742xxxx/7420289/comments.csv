,antileet,2012-07-07T10:19Z,"blehhhhh suck a dick

either love this shit or go troll somewhere else"
,GoodGravy,2012-07-07T11:19Z,"Ha ha, is suck'n dick is the first thing that comes to mind for you?, says alot about you; good luck to the leechers."
,afakgfm,2012-07-09T15:51Z,"@Good Gravy could you stop pickin on the guy that uploaded the thing that you're probably downloading right now? jesus christ, just be happy that he's considerate enough to send this in the first place and stop whining!@"
,revan09,2012-07-12T03:36Z,Does it Work?
,antileet,2012-07-13T00:22Z,"of course, i use it myself... note the mass effect 2 DLC installers have to be copied from the disk's folder onto the HD in order to extract successfully..."
,5443,2012-07-14T03:07Z,"Im going to be sad untill this is all downloaded, Im hoping that more seeders will show up."
,5443,2012-07-14T03:11Z,"or in this case, people will seed untill more have downloaded it, This is one of the only Complete torrents I have seen. It makes everything so much easier. "
,schuberth2,2012-07-14T11:59Z,"According to my torrent client, most people are stuck around 75% and it barely moved 1% during the whole night (just got up and checked status of download).

So yeah, it's a bit slow."
,schuberth2,2012-07-14T12:00Z,"BTW, why make it a one big ISO file?"
,antileet,2012-07-14T17:13Z,"yeah it was slow last night- had to upgrade my pc ;) 

finished now... back to uploading!!"
,schuberth2,2012-07-15T13:58Z,"Progress report: most people stuck around 82%

So, this comes at 6-7% per day. Still have at least 3 days before it's finished. :"

,5443,2012-07-17T04:23Z,"I dont know if you took your seed box down or what, but everyone seems to be stuck at 95.6%

When I get it completed I will seed for a few weeks to relieve the stress on your box."
,rmpm01,2012-07-17T16:35Z,"someone could add more seeds, stopped at 98.4%
when I finish downloading I will leave seeding for a year"
,5443,2012-07-17T18:52Z,"I got a complete download, I will continue seeding for 2 weeks"

,Squego,2012-07-23T16:32Z,"Hi guys !
Thank you very much for this great compilation (i've only played the first episode yet).

Just one question : Is this only english or is there other language (at least in subtitle) ?
I'd like the french subtitles (but if there isn't I'll play without).

Thanks again."
,Togabear,2012-07-24T16:05Z,"Thanks so much! It took three days, but thank you."
,Maclouze,2012-07-25T13:21Z,"Hi !

,Maclouze,2012-07-25T13:58Z,"So, I have some problems whiut mass effect 2 and the DLC.

I have this http://www.noelshack.com/2012-30-1343217369-retrrteds.png when i try to install a lot of DLC. Maybe it's your torrent maybe it's me because utorrent crash when i was dowloading...i think i download again and tell you if it's correct"
,indexftw,2012-07-25T21:38Z,"@5 Kb/s ? Come on I seed with speed 85-90.

,ceki78,2012-07-31T12:49Z,Can you upload Earth Multiplayer DLC please?
,indexftw,2012-07-31T18:41Z,Thanks everyone 
[V],k1ng_ruLz,2012-08-01T21:32Z,Awesome Upload mate :)
,Fenakar,2012-08-04T03:25Z,"Mounted and installed Mass Effect 1 using deamontools lite and I get the ""Please insert the correct CD-Rom"" error when I run the game. Any files I need to fool around with or any other fixes?"
,logicdude,2012-08-04T06:03Z,"You sir, are absolutely brilliant! I like the way you do this! All in, no sloppiness or laziness! I will download this ASAP!"
,dondamov123,2012-08-05T12:10Z,"How do you install the 3rd one?

Keeps saying that some files went corrupt during installation, every time..."
,dondamov123,2012-08-05T13:48Z,"And for some reason it won't let me open the About / NFO (PDF) file, since there's apparently no extension..."
,dondamov123,2012-08-05T14:31Z,Could we get an installation guide :)?
,end_of_line,2012-08-05T20:34Z,"Same issue with installing ME3. Claims corrupted files, asks for re-download. Are there corrupt files in the iso? Thx. Still seeding."
,Exodus6595,2012-08-07T17:02Z,seed pls it's at 94.6% now downloading at 10 kb/sec
,dondamov123,2012-08-09T13:59Z,"Yeah the mass effect 3 installation files are broken in this torrent, i just downloaded the whole thing again, same problem.

Any chance you can re upload just the mass effect 3 installation files?"
,antileet,2012-08-11T13:02Z,"Like I said- if you encounter any installation file corruption please go to the disc's directory and find the respective game folder and manually install anything that wouldn't work. 

Use your heads, guys... this torrent WORKS if you know HOW."
,Karakoran,2012-08-12T01:20Z,Please seed. I'll seed for weeks when it's finally done dling. 
,end_of_line,2012-08-13T02:36Z,"The problem I have is that after downloading the iso, mounting it, copying the contents over to my HD, all I'm left with as a directory is:

-Game
-Installer Data
-ME1
-ME2
-autorun.exe
-OriginInstaller.exe (Reloader)

No direct ME3 folder. And going through any of the other loading methods leads to a corruption error preventing full install. Working with rar files in ""Game"" has part 28 giving me-

""!   C:UsersOwnerDesktopMass Effect TrilogyGameGameFiles.part28.rar: CRC failed in BIOGameCookedPCConsolecit_fetch_kron7b_i_D_FRA.afc. The file is corrupt""

I'm sorry, but I need more direction than ""manually install from the disc directory."" "
,420phil,2012-08-18T04:09Z,Having the same problem as Maclouze when installing several DLC's. Even when going to the disc directory and trying from there. Is it a vista problem perhaps?. Please reply with solution. Thx!
,420phil,2012-08-18T04:15Z,Okay i just had a ID10T Problem with the DLC's. LOL Just noticed your comment about the installers needing to be copied to HD. My bad. As you were. 
,Razor_X_Works,2012-08-23T15:52Z,"Thx antileet for this!
Really easy installation, and thx for the DLC's!"
,avirperi,2012-08-23T23:37Z,"Hi there =) 
I'm trying to install ME3, but the installer keeps saying that the archive contains some corrupted files. I am perfectly sure the torrent was downloaded properly.And ME1 installed perfectly. But is there a way to get rid of the problem with ME3? I ache to play it)"
,ZXMateusXZ,2012-08-28T22:37Z,"Excellent work here, thanks!
And please, Seed it! (:"
,schuberth2,2012-09-01T21:55Z,"Yes, there is a corruption in the 28th RAR file:

GameFiles.part28.rar: CRC failed in BIOGameCookedPCConsolecit_fetch_kron7b_i_D_FRA.afc. The file is corrupt

But it seems like it's something for the French language - guess it can still be played :)"
,a3006,2012-09-06T17:21Z,"ME1 and its DLC works (if it doesn't, do a manual crack; Installer fucks up and makes two binaries folders sometimes)

ME2 works; half of DLC however is corrupt (not even manual install does work; have to reDL them)

ME3 installer is corrupt; DLC works (used another ME3 release)

- -
Waste of space imo; Ripped updates, working dlc, cracks and unlockers.

"
,1220622,2012-09-10T06:47Z,"So I've only installed Mass Effect 1 so far, did all the DLC, the update and the crack, but when I go to play it, I get a pop up asking for my serial number and every time I put the on it gave me, it rejects it. Any ideas?"
,Kornklefx,2012-09-12T10:37Z,"Any seeders? This collection looks great, would really like to have it since downloading each dlc and game is such a chore. =/ "
,lamole234,2012-09-17T22:14Z,Only Extended Cut DLC for mass effect 3? only this DLC?
,athinagoras,2012-09-19T10:45Z,got same problem as the a previous guy.Installed ME1 followed the instructions and when i click play on launcher it requires cdkey.I use the one given and it rejects it.Some feedback would be appreciated.Thx
,athinagoras,2012-09-19T11:01Z,never mind fixed it.Advice:Dont extract the crack file directly to the mass effect game file as the iso instructs you.Instead extract it elsewhere then copy paste it on the masseffect.exe inside the binaries.Have fun
