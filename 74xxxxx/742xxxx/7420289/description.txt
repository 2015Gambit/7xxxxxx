###PROPER/RELOADED (Mass Effect 1)

Originally SiMONΓÇÖs Repack of Mass Effect was slated for release with this collection, however the degree of compression used in his release led to a few corrupt CRC headers as a result. IB instead chose to use PROPER/RELOADEDΓÇÖs retail release of Mass Effect, along with SiMONΓÇÖs No-DVD executable so that both BDtS and Pinnacle Station should work. If you are experiencing texture corruption on Therum or Pinnacle Station, please make sure your graphics drivers are up to date. Please also clear the local shader cache (in the Mass Effect launcher), that should do the trick.

###Razor1911 (Mass Effect 2 RETAIL Release)

This is NOT the pre-release ISO that was leaked two weeks prior to Mass Effect 2ΓÇÖs Release. The installer is the RETAIL installer and a separate menu allows for installation and patching of the DLCΓÇÖs. Please be sure to block Mass Effect 2.exe with windows (or your favorite) firewall.

###RELOADED (ME3 Extended Cut)

To install the games, simply use the Autorun menu provided on this Bluray ISO release. It should do the trick in helping to install all games and their content.
