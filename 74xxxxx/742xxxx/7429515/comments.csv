,woaafm03,2012-07-23T22:15Z,"Great quality, thanks!"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-08-08T05:32Z,"Yeah, I too am sceptical of the validity of this quality. Lindsey Stirling's tracks are only available from Itunes, or her website if we're talking about obtaining them via legal means. Even if you're getting them freely from this source, this source would have needed an original source to obtain it, being the two aforementioned above. 

Itunes typically runs their tracks as m4a's(not mp3's) and their bit rate is around 256 kbps."
,Lost_Leaf,2012-08-08T05:38Z,"Her website however provides mp3's, but the highest quality bit rate she provides is 128 kbps, which is worse than the quality provided on Itunes.

I you however instead ripped these off of Youtube, the quality would most certainly not be 320 kbps.

Getting a program such as EAC and using it to encode lossy files into lossless files (FLAC's) Does not improve the quality.  "
,Lost_Leaf,2012-08-08T05:45Z,"Because you're essentially trying re-create quality that has already been robbed of the file (It can't be done)

So since Lindsey has not officially released a physcial CD which a lossless encode can be ripped from; nor has she provided any official quality higher than around 256 kbps -- For the time being 320 kbps does not exist for the consumer.

I guess we'll have to wait until sometime around September, when she is believed to be releasing her debut album. I'm sure it will be commercial enough to come in FLAC or at least 320 kbps.

Until then, anyone looking for the highest quality, look for the files that originated from Itunes."
