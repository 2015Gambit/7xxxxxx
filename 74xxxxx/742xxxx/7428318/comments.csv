,Hallo71,2012-07-16T18:25Z,"I get this error:

bf2.exe is not a valid win32 application which indicates that the file is corrupted or it's not compatible.

I run Win7 x 64 and used Winrar. Any help will be appreciated."
,honeyes,2012-07-19T00:23Z,You need to extract to the system Program Files folder. Try opening bf2.exe without using a shortcut.
