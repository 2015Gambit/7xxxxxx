[T],tr108,2012-07-11T01:32Z,"Everyone-

I use HandBrake (a free, open-source encoding app) to convert MKVs to .m4vs. You can find the presets I use for 720p & 1080p (and basic instructions, including which version of HB to download) at:
http://www.peejeshare.com/files/363230336/HandBrake_Presets_July2012.zip.html

I hope to do a step-by-step when I have time... no ETA tho. 

And I want to get around to some of the titles mentioned.

@dilligaf247 - Subler (the app I use to add subs, chapters, and tagging info) creates the Preview Images (the Photo-JPEG video track) whenever you add a chapter track."
