This good old Japanese anime cartoon was extremely hard to find in the USA. It's VERY popular throughout Asia, and I'm not sure why it isn't recognized globally, but here are the 9 CDs from the 1979 TV Show.

Basic Summary: Doraemon is a robot cat from the future who has been stuck in modern times. He lives with a nice family though, and the little boy Nobita is his best friend. Doraemon is constantly helping Nobita through the use of a variety of magical and technologically advanced tools from the future, which he can pull from his seemingly endless pocket.

Enjoy!
