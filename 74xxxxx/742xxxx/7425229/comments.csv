,fommod,2012-07-09T00:10Z,Thank you!
,Mortikus,2012-07-09T03:36Z,"Unfortunately no... still trying to acquire the 267MB version out there, and will be seeding the heck out of it once fully acquired (assuming it's legit).  I'll see if I can find it elsewhere... I'm trying not to look anywhere for race results until I can see the race."
,Mortikus,2012-07-09T03:45Z,"I got a lead on a good 889MB version of the race, will post shortly."

,potprinc3,2012-07-09T08:09Z,same here man. I avoid the moto sites like Plague till I have seen it. the 267 MB is a webrip. Quite a low bitrate so the video is choppy. Something was better than nothing though as it came out atleast 8-10 hours before any other release. Need to get on a top site for MotoGP methinks
,LanMax,2012-07-20T21:45Z,sweet. Thanks.
