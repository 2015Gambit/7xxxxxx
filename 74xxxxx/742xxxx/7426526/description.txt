Lyrics

 Ooh ooh ohh
 oh oh oh
 Ooh ooh ohh
 oh oh oh
 oooh oh oh oooh oh oh
 ooh ooh ooh ooh

 I, need somebody who calls my name
 When clouds are smokin up my way
 You get me through these cha-changing skies

 I, don't wanna be afraid again
 its just that I could use a friend
 You get me through these cha-changing skies

 Give me something that I
 Can wrestle to the ground
 There isnt anything that I cant handle now-iow.
 Believe me when I say
 That I Will Be Okay
 And listen theres some voice
 and my Cha-Changing skies

 Changing skies
 Cha-cha-cha-changing
 Changing skies
 Cha-cha-cha-changing
 Changing skies
 Changing skies
 Changing skies
 Cha-cha-cha-changing

 Ooh ooh ohh
 oh oh oh
 Ooh ooh ohh
 oh oh oh
 oooh oh oh oooh oh oh
 ooh ooh ooh ooh

 And I,
 Don't wanna be the kind to cry
 I wanna dance right through the night
 You get me through these cha-changing skies

 Know, that I am not emotional
 Its just that I dont wanna fall
 Without my parachute tonight

 Give me something that I
 Can wrestle to the ground
 There isnt anything that I cant handle now-iow
 Believe me when I say
 That I Will Be Okay
 And listen to some advice
 and my cha-changing skies

 Changing skies
 Cha-cha-cha-changing
 Changing skies
 Cha-cha-cha-changing
 Changing skies
 Changing skies
 Changing skies
 Cha-cha-cha-changing
