,phaze421,2012-07-11T05:32Z,"Installed and works great on MBP 13"" mid2009

To install on a partition:

1) open disk utility>click partition>click ""+"" under partitions available.

2) create a name and select the size of your partition. I did 100gb

3) click create partition.

4) When finished, click the ""Install Moutain Lion"" file from the torrent.

5) the prog will ask where you'd like it to install. Select your current hard-drive or the partition you just created. 

6) the program will install. When it's finished it will restart. Hold the alt key down while the computer is rebooting. Select the hard drive you installed mountain lion to. It will install some more and require a reboot again. reboot and thats it!"

About installing:
