Episode 18 : The Raids of Lawrence of Arabia

T.E. Lawrence is one of the most legendary of raiders. The British could not afford to divert troops to support the Arabs in a revolt against the Turks during World War 1. Instead, acting as liaison officer with the Arabs, Lawrence led a series of raids against the railway lines supplying the Turkish army in the field, and captured the port of Aqaba.
