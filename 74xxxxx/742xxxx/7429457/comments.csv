,JustRacey,2012-07-18T19:14Z,"I downloaded ths because we don't get a lot of ""good"" shows here in the Philippines-- or we get them weeks or years after they first air in the USA (I am American) and was pleasantly surprise with this show. It is really quite good. Well worth watching. If you like shows with interesting characters (Saving Grace, The Finder, Bones, Weeds etc.) then you will like this show! Good torrent too!"
