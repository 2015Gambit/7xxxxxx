COMPLETE SEASONS 1-5


Anna Richardson hosts a series which aims to tackle the UK's sexual ignorance and reticence.
The series explores British attitudes to sex discovering what people of all ages know, think and do in the bedroom. Examining the rise in STIs, teenage pregnancy and the ubiquity of pornography, she discovers a country where it appears easier to have sex than talk about it. Specially commissioned surveys and discussions cover the full range of sexual experiences and their consequences.
