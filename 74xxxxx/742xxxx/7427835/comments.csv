as u requested i will keep wmc but size of iso will not be below 1gb for x64 (>700mb for x32)did it will work for u?
let me know.......and which version u want 32 or 64 bit any other specific thing u can comment

as u ppl comment i can add stuff in newer version so far requested  IE,Folder sharing,gadgets,remote desktop,snipping tool,home group,"
,b_addy,2012-07-12T11:26Z,"You will continue to do your slim builds without WMC , WMP, etc. (useless for me, but I understand if others want them)? "
,nileshtambe,2012-07-12T12:31Z,"no no i can add them ,if u ppl ask for it, i will include
i am using my slim build , these version i posted because ppl ask for IE due to some gov sites , antivirus like panda requires it, now somebody requested windows media center it also requires wmp.

or just make one version with speech,natural languages ,languages ,tablet pc ,help , recovery removed , as u go on keeping components os size will be bigger and it will be no more lite version what u think?"
,b_addy,2012-07-12T14:00Z,"What I ment was that I like your lite builds, let's say I agree keeping WMP or IE, but things likde Media Center should be left for the full version. Otherwise, yes, what is the point of a lite build anyway?"
,b_addy,2012-07-12T14:02Z,"What I ment was that I like your slim builds. I understand keeping WMP or IE, but thing like Media Center should be left for the full version. What is the purpose of lite build than...?"

,ame_00,2012-07-14T02:29Z,"Why is it a delay before i can delete files?
This is in general ok, but because of this i can not install Steam... 

Any suggestion to fix that?"
,ame_00,2012-07-14T02:40Z,"Why is it a delay before i can delete files, this is in general ok. But because of this i can not Install Steam... Because it needs to delete its exe file upon the update of the software... a solution to this was to enable Application Experience in System, but this is gone...

Suggenstion to fix?"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-15T08:31Z,"@ame_00
there is no delay in deleting files  ,ur antivirus may be doing that if u have one installed,

,cismanm,2012-08-01T04:34Z,"Stay far away from Nil's windows 7 ultimate crap, he took out so much stuff that system is unstable, there is not even Internet Explorer so when you install the windows how are you suppose to even go online so u can download apps like Google chrome or microsoft security essentials? You don't.  When i installed Microsoft Security Essentials on his version of windows it couldnt even start and gave errors, i've also received errors from the nvidia website while trying to install the graphics and then the worst part came when the task bar and start menu dissappeared all together!!!"
,b_addy,2012-08-01T08:04Z,"This version has IE9, as the title says.
And when 100 people say that this is good, and you come out from your cave and say that is not, you should probably look for a doctor near by."

,DigitalHippy,2012-08-02T01:47Z,"Hey, I've  built a network rendering station and to get better performance I wanted to run ur versions of os 7. I installed version 3 of urs i think and immediately couldn't run any of my auto desk or adobe stuff ( c++ runtime and dot net i think were the issues) so, disappointed didnt even go any further and installed my old os back. So with this new version with all dot net etc id be able to fully network with all autodesk and adobie software??"

,droseacc,2012-08-19T04:48Z,"Hi nil, thanks the awesome build

I have a few problems though

First Steam doesn't work after install however the solution press F8 at start up, choose ""Safemode with Networking Support"" and update steam from there, it will then work fine in windows, will probably need to do future updates in safe mode, it's not really a prob but maybe a compatibility issue you'd like to resolve.

The next issue I had was with out of memory issues, which is strange because my PC has 4gb of memory, and in standard windows installs I've never had this message no matter what I have open, but now it seems I can't have a browser with multiple tabs open while say running a PC game, eventually the games crashes with an out of memory error if I do. I suspect this may be to the lack of a windows swap file, are you aware of this issue and any resolutions?

Thirdly is it possible to get rid of the picture of selena gomez from the system properties page, it seems kind of creepy having a picture of a little girl there.

Anyway
Thanks for the OS, hope you keep making these builds."
,droseacc,2012-08-19T14:40Z,"I ended up fixing all these issues, cheers."
,pdot622,2012-08-31T05:52Z,"will this build work with parallels? i can't get the network adapters to show up.

Works great in bootcamp"
,Rambomadcow,2012-09-19T08:41Z,Does this have Aero stripped out completely? I'm running it in a VM to test it first but I'm a big fan of Aero.
