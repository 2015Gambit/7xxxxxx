And they both have the same drive.
 
It may be a public relations job, but now that EveΓÇÖs seen whatΓÇÖs under NolanΓÇÖs crew suit, itΓÇÖs gotten personal. After a few dates she has Nolan pretty revved up. If only sheΓÇÖd learn to relax and enjoy it. NolanΓÇÖs sure that the spontaneous birthday bash heΓÇÖs throwing for Eve in Las Vegas should loosen her up. Somewhere between cocktails and a smoking-hot motel-room derby, it does more than that. Now EveΓÇÖs wrestling with feelings she never expected, as everything about her personal jackman gets harder than she ever imagined.
