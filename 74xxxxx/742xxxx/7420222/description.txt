I had originally upped a torrent like this four years ago, but those audio files were ripped from torrents taken from TV, and so the sound quality was mixed, and they were full of commercials and promos. These are ripped clean to 48 kbps mp3 directly from the DVDs.

Since each episode of Aaron Sorkin TV is like a little play, the sound is actually the best part of his shows; the brilliant dialog. I like to listen to these on my mp3 player, and since the original torrent is still alive four years late, I guess many of you do, too. I hope you enjoy them.
