Each of India's ancient, historic monuments is a window to the rich heritage of its past. Let us hear what one of its greatest, and most imaginative minds had to say about such great sites:

"At Sarnath, near Benares, I could almost see the Buddha preaching his first sermon, and some of his recorded words
would come like a distant echo to me, through two thousand five hundred years. Ashoka's pillars of stone, with their
inscriptions, would speak to me in their magnificent language, and tell me of a man who, though an emperor, was greater than any king or emperor".
- Jawaharlal Nehru in The Discovery of lndia'
