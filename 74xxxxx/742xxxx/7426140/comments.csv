,nett5980,2012-07-09T10:29Z,"@quinny82   ....  I downloaded a free converted called Aura Video Converter.  Really easy to use, and you can convert any files to almost anything.  I have been transfering all these recent mp4s to AVIs for the TV. Works Great.

EZTV, excellent work as always. "
,lizardomanson,2012-07-09T10:40Z,Any avi out there? not al dvd player can read mp4 native or in a usb pen drive.

,SALPAR2005,2012-07-09T14:14Z,"For those wanting to convert mp4 to avi for consistant playback, streaming etc etc

I suggest a TPB search for 'AVS Video Converter' i would post a link but i too have to use a proxy due my 'Brave Sir Robin' of an ISP, but anyone with half a brain should be able to find it

Its a cool piece of kit even converts from .mkv 'oh those russians' 

anyway hope this helps ;)"
,TheJoker47,2012-07-09T15:21Z,"Look at the random dumb people who rates this torrent down.. sad very sad. This is as good as you can get it!

,Cyberfart,2012-07-09T17:51Z,If you want to convert it to avi you can do that at http://www.convertfiles.com/. I use it myself now and then. No need to install anything.

,BePe84,2012-07-09T19:46Z,TNX EZTV for ALWAYS supplying me with the latest tv-episodes in PERFECT quality! Don't know what I'd do without ya!
,TheBesteva,2012-07-09T21:55Z,"when i click on the magnet link it says ""application not found"" and i cant download it, so i randomly tryed to get another torrent on this website and i get the samething, anyone know whats wrong ?"
,karol_knl,2012-07-09T22:02Z,Thanks ! eztv is always awesome ! 
,funseeker521,2012-07-10T00:19Z,Thanks eztv. Can't believe all these people waiting for someone to tell them how to convert their files. Ever heard of Google??? Type in your problem and BAM you have solved something on your own! We like these AVI files because they're smaller and we are trying to save room on our HD and please don't come back and brag about having 20 terrabytes of storage. I don't fucking care.
,YingKing0203,2012-07-10T01:44Z,"To all who need to convert to AVI, there's a program called Panzera. It's free. You can get it from cnet. And remember: you're getting files for free; beggars can't be choosers."
,w00tbie,2012-07-10T03:44Z,my TV plays all mp4 but not all avi. it used to be me converting everything. now i'm all ty ty ty ty ty! guess you can't please everyone. thanks eztv xx
,PhatalError,2012-07-10T06:20Z,"@ TheBesteva make sure you have uTorrent. Seems like its a problem with Magnet Links you're having. If nothing works, try to find one without a magnet link, though that might be a tad difficult, as most are magnet links lately. "
,obvious2me,2012-07-10T08:02Z,"plug computer into receiver, plug receiver into tv, click play.

No conversion, takes 30 seconds for a brick to accomplish, result: watching everything on 65inch led hdtv with 5.1 surround."
,chief2k12,2012-07-10T11:22Z,"Well, i have converted files from Mp4 to Avi, and for some odd reason the files wont play. It has to be Avi from whom ever encoded it i guess , i will give that program a shot, but mp4 is a lower quality version from avi, so its kinda makes sense why the players wont accept this avi file that is created from a lower quality video file like mp4"
,vampi11,2012-07-10T15:38Z,thank you. GREAT!
,DiskDoktor,2012-07-11T03:06Z,Thx ez +1

,Sanic_,2012-07-12T07:51Z,"bodan.com can suck my nuts, Im not going to that virus infected website to get a password just to watch a show. wtf eztv!"
,ndwarez,2012-07-12T12:39Z,"chief2k12

that what you talking realy dont have sense.

Your problem is your encoding programm is bad so your avi are not readable by your player. Converting from lover cquality to higer (for example from dvd to blue ray) you will get on size but quality will be the same it wont inprove but player will still play.  One of free that i use is VirtualDub (its my favorite for many years but cant do everything) what VirtualDub cant do i do with avs4you for years also but its not free but it never faild me. Thers a lot of good free converters you can find give it a test and you will get one you like."
,wbryana,2012-07-13T20:45Z,Thanks ez as always wonderful torrent keep it up!
,randomss,2012-07-14T17:02Z,@TheBesteva:have you downloader a p2p client?if you havent then download Îźtorrent.also i suggest to open the magnet links with firefox!
,dennistremp,2012-07-14T23:13Z,"Great dl as always. Thanks eztv.
The show has gone downhill tho. As a person who hates the vamp craze lately I enjoyed the show anyway cuz its entertaining but last season's witch theme with Harry Potters step-mom bitch was almost unbearable. Oh boo hoo you got burned at the steak u cant just keep coming back to life in whatever body u want. And all of a sudden lafayette is a medium and he never knew? Does every person on this show have powers now? Ugh."

Also @TheBesteva are you using a MAC? If so, you need to open you torrent downloader first."
