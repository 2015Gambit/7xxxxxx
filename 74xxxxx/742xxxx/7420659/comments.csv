,Dimmis80,2012-07-08T11:15Z,Thanks for the info.Two weeks..!!Christ.Ok Olympic rules and stuff but 2 weeks without our favorite soap is kinda a lot.!!But what can we do the God..Network desides so we must live 2 weeks without it.At least all of the guys of the show will have the change to go for vacation or something so will be back fresh and ready to play.
