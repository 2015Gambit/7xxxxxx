,Uploader_Guy,2012-07-10T17:09Z,"@Concordi it releases on different dates all over the world. It's already out in my country, Norway."
,balrog814,2012-07-10T18:18Z,"concordi you are new to this, but still you'd have delayed your subscr. by another 20 years... Abandon your stupid comments"
,lagafreud,2012-07-10T18:46Z,"Idiots. he (concordi) was referring to the overusing of ""DVDrip"". This is not a DVD-rip."

,Concordi,2012-07-10T23:39Z,"No, I'm definitely not new to this, have used PirateBay for many years ...!
He has written ""DVDrip"", which this clearly is not! thats why I asked if this was fake....morons..."
,Taurean22,2012-07-11T00:26Z,rofl wtfc!
,Halvarssonlol,2012-07-11T00:26Z,"@Concordi

No you didnt belive this was a dvd rip becuase in your country it dosent come out before 31st of July
You said so yourself. And if u knew it wasent a dvd rip why even ask hm ? And if what your telling is true you should know that anything scene4all uploads is legit,never had any problems with his torrents and never will have. 

Thanks scene4all for upload appriciate it."
,balrog814,2012-07-11T00:46Z,"Spankdaddy, word!!! If this goes down, I will make a knockout rampage in the EU Parliament among all poophead politicians. Also the pentagon. My knuckles will drip blood."
,makpirat,2012-07-11T01:32Z,WTF means legit? seriously what the fuck it means???
,makpirat,2012-07-11T01:34Z,and Im going to doownload this shit beacause one men said its worth to watch it. its so hard to say your opinoin about the movie instead of fucking around like asshole bitcheas.
,jorgeykary,2012-07-11T01:50Z,"I'd rather see him fighting in the octagon, but since he's retired now, it'll have to do with seeing him in a movie. This is a real-life tough guy, people, this ain't no actor. This is a 5 time UFC heavyweight champion who was still active and competing at age 47. YOU GO RANDY!"
,jorgeykary,2012-07-11T01:54Z,then I wonder... why did my comment got deleted? I didn't say anything wrong... did I?
,njaksrb,2012-07-11T01:55Z,quality?
,abracadaver0,2012-07-11T02:20Z,"I'm skeptical of any of the UFC fighters-turned-into-actors deals, and this screams B movie, but I've been proven wrong before(sup, Army of Darkness). What's the quality and general movie rating of TPB users on this? I don't like imdb's rating people."
,lifeaspic,2012-07-11T03:05Z,"Those boorish ""people"" who are primitive enough to be so harsh on the noobs, are most likely nothing more than: adolescents, those who do nothing socially but write comments in these areas, forums, and chat rooms, and definitely unintelligent.  If they were to be conversing face to face, they wouldn't have the nerve to say what they say, it's very easy to hide behind bandwidth, and a screen, snicker, and wipe their doritos on their not so tidy-whiteys. 
Did you notice that Concordi left a question mark at the end of ""fake"", instead of attacking the torrent outright out of ignorance??? That's pretty benign..
At one time, as JOKERfl said, everyone was a noob, Nobody is born the ""torrent jesus"" sliding into this world, wet, sticky, and with a keyboard and mouse in hand.  I think if anyone in this world is lucky enough to be able to afford a computer, internet connection and an hdtv, they should act like they are part of a civilized society, not in a dog kennel."
,mammerjam,2012-07-11T03:09Z,"haha look at this bickering!!! Cant we all just get along!!!  oh and btw what the guy above me said, any UFC fighter as lead role...... I'll pass"
,Fritz.,2012-07-11T03:20Z,"@abracadaver0     peoples opinions of movies here is all over the board, but this site is mostly filled with either youngsters or poor people. youngsters obviously dont have full education or experience, and poor people tend to be uneducated morons... im sure you can figure it out from there."
,jameskrueger2nd,2012-07-11T05:11Z,"Thank you scene4all

A,V = 10 DVDRip

,Hatebreeder_420,2012-07-11T09:15Z,"a/v great
the movie is retardedly gay though.
thats my review

but still, thanks scene4all"

,zakimar,2012-07-11T13:29Z,TOTAL CRAP!!!
,Ssgtmcnasty,2012-07-11T13:58Z,"@Concord

DVD's, especially ones like this one that go straight to DVD, are released to thousands of people LONG before it is released to the general public...in any country. Whether they be critics, screeners, or just employees of the company that prints/write the DVD. 

That being said, please stop coming in here to talk out of your ass....noone is interested in your garbage. People come to comments to see the quality of the movie, and maybe an opinion or two...not its origin. Anyone who comes specifically looking for types, and origin is a pirate looking to write and possibly sell it. 

Try being like the TRUE community here, and just enjoy what people are kind enough to share for your enjoyment. Thanks uploader.

A/V 10
M Cant recommend this....unless you like B movies made by lazy movie makers."
,Dreadmore,2012-07-11T17:24Z,"@Lifeaspic They should post that on the homepage as a general rule of thumb for everyone...

@Thxalways Agreed

@Fritz You sound ignorant yourself generalizing whatever you consider ""Poor"" to be, I kind of want to punch you in the face.. But I'm probably just another poor idiotic American, right?

Oh and the movie is terrible unless you enjoy laughing at bad movies with your friends 
"
,tr99tr,2012-07-11T17:46Z,ah fritz dont be philistine we all know were ignorance leads. your kind have already caused two world wars. you dont want to be eating potatoes for the next twenty years again. fuckin moron

,Rush,2012-07-11T23:13Z,@plague2u... maybe because it's so obscure you're the only one who's ever heard of it.... IMDB has nuthin on it.
,buzzrking,2012-07-11T23:42Z,"Who agrees with me that new releases should be changed to MP4's, because AVI's is an old video format that doesn't release store much quality video in it?"

BERNIE 2011 Release date 4 May 2012 (USA)

,rainmaker7,2012-07-12T00:58Z,The movie is a total garbage. Do not spend your time on it.

You don't know much about video formats, do you? Get yourself any video converter, check out possible video settings for each format, make some test conversions. "

,Gimpman83,2012-07-12T02:50Z,"Good rip vid9/aud9/mov3 but IMHO BAD MOVIE.
Couture is a HORRIBLE actor and it's nasty having to look at those cauliflower ears! Only good I can say is there is some ok action, and when bullets hit they look realistic (not that Ive ever seen someone shot :P )."
