This is a short story written by myself (imcookie) and basically wanted to share it with you.

It focuses on two people Fred and Barbara and their under stairs cupboard.

I can't tell you more than that because like I said, it's quite short at < 6000 words.

Feel free to comment on it. I'll say right now, it may not be what you're expecting. The humour is quite dark.



Enjoy ;)
