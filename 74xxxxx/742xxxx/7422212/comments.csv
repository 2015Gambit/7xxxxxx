,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-07-07T23:21Z,"as the uploader says, it's the same release as all the others, missing the first few minutes, blurry as hell and I'm guessing that it uses the same audio track as well, which would mean she ain't a TS but instead a CAM for audio.

May be wrong, but I doubt it."

,BaronCurb,2012-07-08T02:28Z,"The file size of his is smaller than theirs. If it's the same quality, I'd prefer the smaller file. I'm sure I'll rewatch it when the DVDRip comes out, just like all the other movies. Thanks uploader."

,GPJPXP,2012-07-12T03:50Z,The video up close is fuzzy. But if you watch from a distance on a HDTV it looks a lot better.
