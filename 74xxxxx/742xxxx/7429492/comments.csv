Come on guys, I appreciate you uploading this, but your numbering of the episodes doesn't match G4's to begin with, it makes it even more confusing when   the different episodes of the finals are mixed up.

I realize this is partly the fault of the stupid arrangement G4 & NBC made in regards to televising ANW. It's made following it a very confusing thing indeed."
