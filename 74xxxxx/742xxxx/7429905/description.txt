Whale Wars: Viking Shores
Every year, the people of the Faroe Islands herd pilot whales to their shallow shores and kill them for their meat. Whale Wars: Viking Shores follows the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as it sets sail to end this ancient tradition known as "The Grind."




5)  Collision Course 
The Sea Shepherds discover that the boats are simply gathering for a row boat race, not for a whale hunt. The Sea Shepherds are continuing their patrols of the Faroe Islands when they receive word that the Japanese whaling fleet which they had been opposing for years is preparing to return to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary to resume operations. The news forces the Sea Shepherds to conclude their operations in the Faroe Islands in order to redeploy to Antarctica. On the final day of operations in the Faroes, the Sea Shepherds find a large pod of pilot whales and successfully drive them away from the islands. While no major whale hunts occurred during the Sea Shepherds' visit, it is revealed that one took place a week after the departure of Sea Shepherd with over 100 pilot whales being killed.
