Through his hard work and support from Aruna and his mother, Ajay is able to correct the wrong doings and is able to win over Aruna's father. 

Amitabh Bachchan's acting prowess is what strikes you when u watch Manzil. This movie is of the period when the thespian was labelled as "an angry young man" and the other movies showed him as such. But this movie is so different. So much economy of movement. An entire song is shown as the actor playing the harmonium with downcast eyes and barely moving his hands. His body language is terrific even when his back is towards the camera. All his dialogs are in close-up and his face changes expression in seconds. It may not be a very well known movie of his but the utmost subtlety with which Amitabh Bachchan acts (does he really ?, it never seems so) proves beyond doubt that he was and still is miles ahead of every 1 else in Bollywood.

Manzil has the eternally superhit rain song, Rhim Jhim Gire Saawan sung by Kishoreda. But my favoutite lifetime best rain song is Rhim Jhim Gire Saawan sung by Lata Didi. Especially the picturisation of this song on a rain drenched Amitabh & Moushami whispering sweet nothings on the wooden seat facing the sea shore
