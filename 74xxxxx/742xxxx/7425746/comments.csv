,sgfreak37,2012-07-09T11:05Z,"Video = 7
Audio = 2

The video is pretty good, the only problem is that it cuts off in parts, sometimes in important parts, so you miss out on things.   The audio is unbearable, you can hardly understand anything. It took me awhile tweaking the audio settings just so I could understand the quiet parts."

This is like the 10th fucking torrent you've said that shit. I suggest learning about what you're using to download before you attempt anything."
