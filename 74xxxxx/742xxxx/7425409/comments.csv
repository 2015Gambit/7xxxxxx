You're a prick.

a) I don't give a fuck if you're happy that someone won.

b) Don't spoil the outcome for those who haven't heard yet."

some people though do take the time to stay away from the news/internet when they missed a sporting event and watching a delayed recording/download.

depending on your tolerance, this rip could be unwatchable. there are many times, spread across the whole duration of the video, where the audio gets out of sync pretty bad but the sync issues don't last that long. so for me it was tolerable but i did curse at times :) 

beggars can't be choosers."
