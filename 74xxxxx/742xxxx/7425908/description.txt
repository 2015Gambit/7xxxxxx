                               Beautiful Crazy (2008)


Three seventeen-year-old girls who are close friends, full of the bubbly exuberance of life. While Angel seems every bit as happy as her best friends, she doesnΓÇÖt talk very much, strangely mirroring the behavior of her father, a bulbous drunkard who spends most of his day staring silently into space. For Amy and Xiao Bu, life seems simple and complete, even when minor annoyances like losing a cigarette or having a bird mess up your favorite outfit seem like epic tragedies for a moment. But with the passage of time, larger troubles loom on the horizon, and when Xiao Bu falls in love, Amy discovers sheΓÇÖs attracted to the same man and her emotions lead her to betray one of her most trusted friends.
