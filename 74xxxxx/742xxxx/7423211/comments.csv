,lothy100,2012-07-08T07:11Z,Is this a full vid or just everything before Silva?
,TsarB0mba,2012-07-08T08:48Z,FYI this rip cuts off the beginning of the prelim broadcast and a bit of the first (?) televised fight. Downloading the webrip of the prelims to see if it's more complete.
,TsarB0mba,2012-07-08T09:43Z,Confirmed - there is at least one fight (and part of another) missing from the beginning of the EViLCREW rip. Downloading the new Sir.Paul rip to see if it's any better.
