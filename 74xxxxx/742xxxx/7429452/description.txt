Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time

 Woke up on the right side of the bed
 What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
 Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
 Cuz it's always a good time.

 Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
 Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
 I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
 Cuz it's always a good time

 Good morning and good night
 I wake up at twilight
 It's gonna be alright
 We don't even have to try
 It's always a good time

 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.

 Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
 Checked out of my room hit the ATM
 Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
 Cuz it's always a good time

 Good morning and good night
 I wake up at twilight
 It's gonna be alright we don't even have to try
 It's always a good time.

 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.

 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.

 Doesn't matter when
 It's always a good time then
 Doesn't matter where
 It's always a good time there

 Doesn't matter when,
 It's always a good time then

 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 It's always a good time
 Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
 We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.

Thanks
