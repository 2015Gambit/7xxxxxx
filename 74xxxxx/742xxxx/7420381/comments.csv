,andoroo,2012-07-11T14:26Z,Thank you for this!
,mule1ear,2012-07-14T02:40Z,Normal people are waiting for prometheus and ted. I've been waiting for this! ty Anon
,S0LER666,2012-07-14T16:53Z,Thanks for uploading this.  I've been highly anticipating this film.
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-18T22:16Z,I wanted to see this after I heard the Alex Jones Show when Joel Gilbert was on. Thanx
,Snake-Baiter,2012-07-25T11:43Z,"Thanks.  That fascist a-hole Jones won't put this online, because he gotta get dat money, son.

If this really has all this allegedly secret info, it seems like someone else would have heard of it and be publishing it.  Strikes me as another Jones scam, like the Gerald Celente videos, but I am interested enough to watch it.

Thanks again."
,Snake-Baiter,2012-07-25T11:52Z,"Just listening to yesterdays Jones show with this guy on.  Sounds like complete and total horseshit.  This guy is saying that Obama has no staff and has to have family members photoshop Facebook pictures for him.  He is also saying that the billionaire Jews who created and have constantly funded communism from the beginning ""don't know the truth"".  He basically has no idea what is going on. 

That doesn't mean he didn't pull up some interesting info though, so I'm stoked to watch this.  Even though it does seem like a whole lot of hype, given that they won't even discuss what is in the video in this interview, and just keep saying ""buy this shit"".  Thanks to you, anon, we don't have to fund Alex Jones' Oxycontin addiction in order to find out wtf this shit is."
,Snake-Baiter,2012-07-25T11:58Z,"Alex has to put out his own films for free to keep up his manufactured image, so he is always looking for hyped up horseshit to sell in the infowars store.  This Gilbert faggot says you have to call him and ask for permission to show it on access TV.  What, is he going to say no?  Or yes?  Can't he just say ""yes"" or ""no"" to whether or not you're allowed to show it on public television.  

I am gonna write him and fake like I want to show it on access TV just to get the ""no"" that he will obviously give.  All these people are snake oil salesmen.

But I digress.  I'm rambling here.  But but but but.  I'll watch the film.

He keeps saying Obama doesn't have a staff to forge documents for him lol.  How goddamn stupid?  ""The president of the United States doesn't have access to the CIA, boys and girls - he has to do this shit on his macbook""."
,disagreeable,2012-07-25T13:06Z,"Well done, Great film. Well done and worth a watch!

To the guy who bags it, its a matter of getting return for the hard work to do all this. After all you dont go to work for free do you? Its only fair for him to make a living from his hard work, and it also benefits the populace, so I say Kudos to him."
,Epockis,2012-07-27T01:44Z,"@Snake-Baiter
I heard that aswell about photoshop. I totally disagree with what he said. I can make a better forgery ffs. But the fact remains, it is a forgery."
,Rax1911,2012-07-29T04:44Z,"Joel's explanation for the manipulated pictures was just an off the cuff theory. But really, how else do you explain why they upload such blatantly bad photoshop jobs? It's either intentional, or they really do have some amateur doing it."
,sothcott,2012-07-29T15:24Z,"There must be a rational reason why the forgery is so bad. Personally I am not sure the birth certificate is a forgery, rather that the scanner software attempted to compress it into a PDF which is not a bitmap format but markup language. This would explain why it would substitute the same bitmap for a character it recognises, saves space."
,sothcott,2012-07-29T15:27Z,"I think it's fair that people charge money for their work. For me Pirate Bay is faster easier and cheaper than ordering the DVD. 

However if I really want a person to watch one of these and wake up then I need to buy the proper DVD and lend it to them and say when I want it back. Otherwise they will ignore it."
,cash416,2012-08-04T21:35Z,"Are you really confused or purposefully spreading misinformation?

@Snake-Baiter  - You do realize that Alex does not own that video but merely interviewed the owner and creator Joel Gilbert!  In regards to your comments about free distribution well if you had listened to the interview you would have learned Joel plans on distributing 300,000 free copies in the next few months! Major portions of the profits of it in the infowar store go into funding the very distribution of those free videos! It's a sure bet some free copies will show up on the net. (cough cough).  Well it's obvious the CIA didn't forge any documents for Obama as any high school student could pull off a better job!  It's also unanimously known and accepted in the industry by experts that many of Obama's documents are total forges.  So who is making them? If you actually watch this film you will learn the forgeries and birth certificate are all bull shit basically a fools errand! Just watch the video! But remember before you make comments at least for the sake of intelligence do at least 5 minutes of real research instead of 5 minutes of your best speculation! "
