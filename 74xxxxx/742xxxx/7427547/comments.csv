,macomaniac,2012-07-10T10:53Z,"Not working as I am concerned. Opening the compressed file gives a .dmg file and a zipped file of 'Zero Ko' each, and nothing can be done with them.

One question moreover : supposing the files to work at installing CrossOver, isn't that a trial version, instead of a cracked one? "
,Rioma-san,2012-07-18T14:11Z,"Hey macomaniac, the .dmg file is an archived crossover version just for Macs.

Nothing to do with it in Windows or Linux ...

And a question: Is trial or Full ???

Greetings."
,macomaniac,2012-07-22T05:56Z,"@ Rioma-san. I run Lion 10.7.4 on a MacBookPro. This torrent simply doesn't work for me. If using '7zX.app' to decompress the 'crosso112.7z' file downloaded on my Mac desktop, I get inside a 'crosso112' folder two files : 'crossover-11.2.0.zip' and 'CrossOver.11.Trial.Extender.dmg', neither of which are susceptible to be open (.zip) or mounted (.dmg). When using the 'get info' function, the answer is : 'size : zero octet'.

,RobotA699,2012-08-21T09:16Z,Doesn't work.. It still says the Trial is 14 days after using the Extender..
,infopost,2012-08-22T10:32Z,"The patch does not work!!! While it says you have over 10,000 days it still expires after 15 days. "
