Hello TPB! This is a DVD rip of the 3rd Amityville movie, Amityville 3-D. And yes, it is in 3D. It's pretty hard to watch it without those old red/cyan glasses. You can get some here for free: http://free-3d-glasses.com/ . The site is actually legit, pinky swear. The glasses take forever to get to your mailbox though. Anyway, enjoy the movie!
