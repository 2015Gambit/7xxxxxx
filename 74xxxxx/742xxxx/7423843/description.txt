Silent Hill 4 tells the story of Henry Townsend, who awakens from a nightmare in his apartment in a town near Silent Hill. He circles the room, eyes and realizes that the door was bricked up - Henry locked in a trap. Five days hanging out and looking for an apartment for his neighbor, he comes into the bathroom and discovers there is a black hole in the parallel worlds with which we are familiar with the first three parts. The Room is clearly divided into two parts. While Henry was sitting in my room, indulging in grim reasoning, the game shows us what is happening in the first person. However, should a player get into a parallel world, as we again see a familiar event in the world - from the outside. The history of the game, unlike the second and third parts, virtually no overlap with the first Silent Hill.
