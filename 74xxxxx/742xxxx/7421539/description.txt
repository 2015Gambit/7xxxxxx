ShineOff is a NEW Adobe┬« Photoshop┬« compatible Plug-In filter that automatically removes the shine from skin. The cold white light of the camera flash creates an unnatural shininess on skin. ShineOff automatically transforms faces and skin areas to a soft and natural looking appearance. This patent pending technology does not remove luster from the lips nor the sparkle from the teeth or eyes.

ShineOff can be run on individual images or be combined with other Image Trends Plug-Ins in a Photoshop Action and applied to a set of images in batch mode.

The ShineOff Plug-in improves skin tones by eliminating the overly reflective effect of the flash!
