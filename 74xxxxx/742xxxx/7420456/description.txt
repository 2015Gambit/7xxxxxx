Written for engineers and engineering scientists, this book gives first priority to the formulation of problems, presenting the classical results as the gold standard, and the numerical approach as a tool for obtaining solutions. The classical part is a revision of the text "Foundations of Solid Mechanics", with a much-expanded discussion on the theories of plasticity and large elastic deformation with finite strains. The computational part is all new and aims to solve major linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems.
