CD-Runner includes Car, Home Stereo, Compact, TouchPad and Ribbon (minimized) style graphical faceplates. The home stereo faceplates are designed to look like a real home hi-fi CD and DVD player, while the smaller car stereo faceplate is designed to look like a real unit that you would find in a car.

The Portable faceplate is designed to look like a generic MP3 player. The new TouchPad faceplate is designed to look like a generic computer tablet, and includes full and small sizes.

All faceplates are highly customizable and may be toggled between as you are playing music or watching movies. Full support is also provided for the freedb and any other CDDB compatible database, which allows you to automatically download and submit Audio CD information (artist & album titles, song titles, liner notes, etc.) online. You can also research over 3 million Audio CDs with the latest Disc Library.
