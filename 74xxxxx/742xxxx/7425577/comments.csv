,Nextsky,2012-08-01T16:13Z,"Good but have interface problems. Don't require activation key.
 - the desktop icon isn't proper, have a numeric name and launch Nero Burning Rom : but all apps are in start menu

 I have found a better option who work perfect

,brainiaq,2012-08-23T20:42Z,"In Nero Vision, PLAY button in the Video TRIM window doesn't work.  Also, can't add additional video tracks.  

Sticking to Nero Vision 10 for now...

But haven't tested Burning ROM or others.  Installed perfectly okay though..."
