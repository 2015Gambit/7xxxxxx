James Blake

Montreux Jazz Festival 2011

He was the musical sensation of 2011: James Blake.
In a BBC poll of critics, the debut album by the artist was declared a 
"milestone of dubstep" although so far only about half of the songs were heard by the critics. 

In Blake's case, the hype is fully justified. 

His ability to create new sound structures, that sound of a familiar hand is terrific.
Enough to inspire the masses and idiosyncratic enough to please critical opinion makers. 

His performance in the Miles Davis Hall also counted as one of the very great moments of the Montreux Jazz Festival 2011.
