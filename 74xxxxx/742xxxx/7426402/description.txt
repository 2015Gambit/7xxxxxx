 John Wayne embodied a strength, integrity, and courage that seemed quintessentially American. His movies and his life demonstrated a clear demarcation between right and wrong, and he was the quintessential Western hero: not afraid to take risks, or take justice into his own hands, he was also a tender lover and a good friend. This selection of 20 John Wayne classics shows the enduring spirit of a legend. THE DAWN RIDER sees The Duke approaching a villain, his gun empty in a tension-filled face-off, while in THE DESERT TRAIL he is framed for murder, and sets out to prove his innocence. John goes undercover to catch a bandit in BLUE STEEL, and rides the rodeo in THE MAN FROM UTAH. These and many more indispensable gems can be found in this essential collection.
