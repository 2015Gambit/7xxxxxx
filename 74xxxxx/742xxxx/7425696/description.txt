Sources - VIDEO: A Friend ....Thanks :P
          AUDIO: A Friend ....Thanks :P

Notes -

Source is nice even in the dark scenes.. the audio is missing at the start for around 2 mins..has 3mins missing in total 

from 2 different places...
.. yes still dark but not bad.. did our thing crop,resize and denoise then barely touched colors as they were very nice.. 

then just cleaned the cam audio sum and muxed it back to our encode... also included the extra scene in the credits... enjoy 

til better source which is right around the corner...... :P 

P.S.

Audio still not great but got dif audio and workin on a V2 with new audio... which as the start and end....
 
Enjoy!!

Extra side note:
