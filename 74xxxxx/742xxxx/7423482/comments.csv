,tflagger997,2012-09-02T02:37Z,"1920*816

816p is much closer to 720p (which is what I was looking for), so thanks.

To everyone - 720p/1080p is not a ratio, it is the number of Horizontal lines.  That means when you see the dimensions: XXX*YYY the quality is technically YYYp.  (:"
,sapo_joe,2012-09-15T05:04Z,"tflagger997, the difference in the vertical size is due to the black stripes on the upper and lower part of the video. The video is presented in the original widescreen format, that is in fact wider than the ordinary 16:9 TV.

It's time people had figured that out already, dammit..."
