This book breaks new ground by doing something for digital photographers thatΓÇÖs never been done beforeΓÇöit cuts through the bull and shows you exactly ΓÇ£how to do it.ΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs not a bunch of theory; it doesnΓÇÖt challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure things out on your own. Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book has ever doneΓÇöit tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. If youΓÇÖre looking for one of those ΓÇ£tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filterΓÇ¥ books, this isnΓÇÖt it. You can grab any other Elements book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and printing your photos like a pro. YouΓÇÖll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques areΓÇöonce you know the secrets.
