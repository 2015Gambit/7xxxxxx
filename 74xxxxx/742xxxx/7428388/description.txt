Shimo is the most advanced VPN client for the Mac platform and supports more protocols than any other VPN application out there! CiscoVPN, AnyConnect, IPSec, OpenVPN, PPTP/L2TP, Nortel and even SSH are no problem to handle for Shimo.

Shimo is able to automate everything around your secure network connections: Establish connections automatically when you change your network location, execute AppleScripts on certain events or get notified about these events. This is just a very small excerpt of Shimo's capabilities. Feel free to download Shimo from our website and find out about its extraordinary feature set. The downloadable version comes without any restrictions and therefore you are able to find out if it suits your personal requirements before you buy a license!
