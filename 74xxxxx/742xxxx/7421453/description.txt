The text of A Feast for Crows and the text of A Dance with Dragons cut and pasted and interspersed so as to make one (huge) volume. Care has been taken to keep chronological order and ensure that things happening in on book come before subsequent events happening in the other book. It's some 1200 pages of A4, so it'll take you a while to read.

The idea of this is so that people who've bought the two original books can now read them as they were intended to be read, before Martin was forced to split them into two volumes due to length. It makes a much better story that way - though a much longer one, also.
