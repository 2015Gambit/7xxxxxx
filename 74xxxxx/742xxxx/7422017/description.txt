Whale Wars: Viking Shores
Every year, the people of the Faroe Islands herd pilot whales to their shallow shores and kill them for their meat. Whale Wars: Viking Shores follows the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as it sets sail to end this ancient tradition known as "The Grind."


1)  Bad Blood 
The MV Brigitte Bardot heads for the Faroe Islands alone trying to stop whale hunting. MY Steve Irwin is detained in Scotland for damaging properties of a fishing company at the Mediterranean Sea to free bluefin tunas. The Sea Shepherds are not welcome due to past encounters. The crew of the Brigitte Bardot speaks to the Faroese about whaling but is warned not to stop whale hunting. Meanwhile, the Sea Shepherds try to smuggle acoustic devices which would be placed underwater along the coast to dispel whales from swimming toward the Faroes, but their attempt is discovered.
