,babybluetits24,2012-07-10T16:27Z,no subs = no download
,JMScomMX,2012-07-10T21:24Z,babybluetits24 = lack of culture & languages
,tastyfreeze,2012-07-10T23:46Z,JMScomMX = ignorant ass since most people are unable to learn a second language due to there education. so piss off
,wookie03,2012-07-11T08:35Z,"tasty you have already proven just how piss poor your education was (btw there is actually spelled THEIR when it refers to something that would belong to or be possessed by someone). Yet that is no excuse, it is the lazy who do not take advantage of the second language class that EVERY school in the country offers. JScomMX good call, now back to the movie!"

,damage782,2012-07-13T06:33Z,In case anyone is wondering: the audio is Spanish and there aren't any English subtitles.
,blind-anders,2012-07-13T19:58Z,"Thank you, maximersk!
And thank you for a great english subtitle, fakeidmuhammad."
,Mutegrill,2012-07-14T05:31Z,"babybluetits24: You don't specify in what language you demand that all movies should be accompanied by a subtitle... All in excistance? Further more; this is not a subtitle download site, you won't find any cathegory refering to subtitles. For that task, you'll find an excessive amount of web sites serving you with subtitles, searching on google. You'll miss out on a lot of great movies with your attitude...

JMScomMX & wookie03: babybluetits24 most likely refeered to the education systems in certain countries, which we should not hold him or their people responsible for. It's people like you, using the power of knowledge to repress others not being as fortunate. You people are the reason why those unfortunate never will evolve.

,vwnutt2000,2012-07-14T21:11Z,for sum reason this isnt working for me using vlc any ideas?
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-22T10:51Z,"Not knowing who commented here and where they are from, but I am assuming they must be american.
Considering that the 2nd most spoken language in the US is Spanish, that 95% of the rest of the continent speaks Spanish have US Residents ever thought of learning Spanish? It could help you so much to not pass for retards. But no, rather speak hick and stay on their own little planet.
I live in a small country, Luxembourg, and one would be unable to find a job unless you speak French, German and English. Most people also speak Spanish, Luxemburgish and Portuguese.
So do yourselves a favour: learn other languages!!!"

Thanks for the upload maximersk"
,jonnycinq,2012-07-23T01:40Z,"So, why are you all commenting in english instead of some other language?"
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-23T18:41Z,"Parce que sinon tu comprendrais rien
Weil Du sonst nix verstehen w端rdest
Porque sino no entenderias nada"
,captain_marvel,2012-07-24T20:56Z,the audio is spanish not english in case someone wonders.
,blackShawarma,2012-07-30T02:46Z,"OK to be clear - the movie's audio is IN SPANISH, and there NO ENGLISH subtitles included.  
For those, like me, that are apparently dense enough to expect a Will Ferrell movie to be in English, and the comments complaining about the lack of subtitles to be the usual lack of Ukrainian subs, rather than English, do read more closely before wasting your time downloading like me.  TFTU in any case."
