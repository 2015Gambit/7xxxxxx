If that's the only way to do it don't up another, we have to see it in the search.

Thanks

,Kaptan_,2012-07-09T17:03Z,"oh excuse me for putting the name of the winner, but I thought it helped to looking for the stage in the future.
I don't see wrong."

Don't get me wrong we do appreciate your uploads (good quality and small file sizes) it's just if you know the winner before you watch something it just ruins the suspense (spoiler)

example:
 Pacquio.vs.Mayweather.HDRip.Floyd.Mayweather

Not much point in watching something we already know the outcome.

If your worried about us finding it in the future just put a brief description of the stage... (climbing Alps, flat stage or time trial) we can get it from there. Most cyclist enthusiast are very well informed on what stage their watching. "
