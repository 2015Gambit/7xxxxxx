To escape the harsh reality of their world,     
Malegaons people seek refuge in the fantastical 
world of cinema. This passion for cinema has    
spurred a group of cinema enthusiasts to make   
their own films-quirky, low budget, socially    
aware and notoriously funny spoofs of Bollywood 
films. Their ambition has grown and now         
they are ready to take on Hollywood and         
Superman. We follow them on this journey.       
At times funny, tragic, contemplative. Always   
warm  and engaging. And as the film begins to   
take shape, through schemes and approaches      
that are sublimely ingenious, simply bizarre    
and purely hysterical, we also slowly discover  
Malegaon itself. A microcosm that embodies      
and reflects the complexities of modern small   
town India. Where the modern and the traditional
rub shoulders, where extreme poverty and extreme
wealth are neighbours, bewildering in its       
diversity, trapped in self-made destinies, with 
a spirit that can never be vanquished.
