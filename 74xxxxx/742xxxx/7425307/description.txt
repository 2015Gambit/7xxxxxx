Episode 19 : US Rangers and the Raid on Cabanatuan

Impressed by the performance of Britain's new elite force, the Commandos, the US Army set up its own special unit - the Rangers. These took part in many of the major Allied landings in Europe, capturing vital strongpoints. In the Pacific, one of their most spectacular actions was a raid deep behind enemy lines to free prisoners-of-war, threatened with massacre by the Japanese.
