,slayer621,2012-09-13T00:46Z,I'm getting an all black screen when playing the episodes from Full Metal Panic (first set).  I can play other .mkv files fine. Anyone know why this could be happening?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-16T23:05Z,"slayer, Update VLc, the files are in 10bit.
Download new VLC or download K-lite Codecs and use MPC.

You are probably using old players that dont support 10bit"
