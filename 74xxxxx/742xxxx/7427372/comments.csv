""crc check failed, please try to reinstall the game"""
,GEVD,2012-07-10T10:13Z,"To solve the problem with ""CRC check failed. Please try to reinstall the game"" just run reg.exe in game's folder if it presents or edit both
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARESlitherinePanzerCorps ""PanzerCorps"" key value and PanzerCorps.txt file in game folder with following 1111-1111-1111-1111 if no reg.exe file present.
the reason for this error is mismatched values in Windows regestry and PanzerCorps.txt file"
,GEVD,2012-07-10T10:21Z,"if you get the CRC error, check your PanzerCorps.TXT file and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE   SOFTWARE  Slitherine PanzerCorps  ""PanzerCorps"" key via regedit; they have to contain the same serial (just find the above key with Run+R -> regedit, and change the ""PanzerCorps"" serial key to 1111-1111-1111-1111)."
,Apaleytos,2012-07-10T16:13Z,Thnx it works 100%

,fsoit,2012-07-13T23:07Z,"Thank you GEVD for the help I tried the new dlc file but still the same, I can play the game but not the more campaigns. I follow all your steps, the only thing  I change is the installation folder ( I dont thing that it is a problem). If you have another idea I will try it. Thanx again...!!!"
,isilox,2012-07-14T13:13Z,"I had the same problem as you with the DLCs, but its simple: just make sure that even on 32-bit windows the installation folder is ""Program files (x86)"" and that the dlcs are in fact unpacked to ""DLC"" folder in game installation folder.

Other than that, you can simply fix it by editing the regfiles with notepad and correcting the paths - 1 minute work.


Awesome torrent, thanks! Anyone has by any chance Unity of Command? The price for it is completely stupid."
,isilox,2012-07-14T13:14Z,"Btw, why is it necesary to copy dls to my documents as well?"
