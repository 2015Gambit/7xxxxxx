,sourceofreality,2012-07-11T22:44Z,"Yify team, how you doing? I found your rips and appreciate what you do. Always quality in a smaller file size. Good work. I was wondering if you  wouldn't mind telling me what software you use for ripping? I'd like to back up my personal dvd's, and with the software I have, in order to attain the same quality it requires a minimum of  3x the file size. 700mb files look like sh^% when I do them. Also how do we get the subs transferred without hardcoding? Thanks for everything."

From the FAQ pages of Yifi-Torrents: http://www.yify-torrents.com/FAQ

Question: How do you do it? Making movies so small, yet such good quality?

Answer: Magic hehe. But in all seriousness I use a combination of software and settings that I have found to work best. For beginner encoders I recommend Handbrake and Format Factory, very powerful tools that do a really good job. "
