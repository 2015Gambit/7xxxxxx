,SgtSlick,2012-07-09T13:30Z,"I like the idea XBT and thanks for the torrent. I want to make a request however, could you assemble an 'ultimate mod collection' with only compatible mods. For example I know ACE & SkyRE are not compatible. I presume you play skyrim? Why not just put together a compilation that you yourself use, when you update this collection then you can upload the updates. Or even make a pdf with links for each mod such as http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=9286  - Skyrim Redone. 

I have tried twice following the STEP pdf and installing all his mods having downloaded them all but its buggy. Game still crashes so much due  to incompatibility issues etc. If you provided a nice alternative to STEP. Something that is a bit less detailed and that contains SkyRE and perhaps RCRN etc. I would be forever thankful :)"
,doublfelx,2012-07-09T19:03Z,Thank you very much : D.
,-xbt-,2012-07-09T21:30Z,"@SgtSlick: That's a great idea.

I upload ALL the mods here that I think anyone would want, so as to not leave anyone out.

However, it is also a great idea to add in my personally collection of only the mods I use. This way no one has to think about it and only has to upload and install all. Great idea, I will add a ""Personal Collection"" torrent soon with only the mods that I personally use."
,SgtSlick,2012-07-10T00:27Z,"Great! I'll definitely download and seed it. 
The main thing, (for me anyway) is overcoming compatibility issues. CTD's in Skyrim happen all the time (for me anyway) and they are always just a mystery.. 

Since I have like 100+ mods its just a nightmare trying to figure out the cause. You have to have compatibility patches for some of them, load them in certain orders, and even installing them in certain orders. Its totally ridiculous. 

So it'd be great â&#x2122;Ľ"
,auger4,2012-07-10T02:12Z,can you upload the Zelda Audio Conversion mod and MinerFriends - Minecraft mod from the workshop
,Mharkk,2012-07-13T13:07Z,"Hi... i Need Some Help, i Want To Know If This Would Work With Update.9.Reloaded? Thanks..."
,-xbt-,2012-07-15T01:26Z,"a) crashes: if you keep getting crashes you might be using too many mods.

b) minecraft mod: i uploaded that in my 243 mds from steam torrent.

c) yes, you can use with Update 9."
,auger4,2012-07-16T00:37Z,@-xbt thank you for letting me know but what is the name of the Minecraft file can't seem to locate it?
,adrielcaixeta,2012-07-21T08:47Z,"Sorry to ask, but I can't find the Immersive Armors
