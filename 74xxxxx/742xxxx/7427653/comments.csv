Are you serious?, here is the scan report

https://www.virustotal.com/file/3749f5cca33b6bb1efbef14d0074bfa607b081fb79eff914af44b78efb82fd63/analysis/1341862609/

and the 3 detections are FALSE POSITIVE. All my torrents are 100% CLEAN.

I dont know how you can tell that something like that is not in wallpapers...this torrent is Animated Wallpaper and not images files like .jpg, "
