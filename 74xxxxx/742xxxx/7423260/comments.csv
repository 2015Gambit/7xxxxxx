This one stay pretty true to that, and I thought it was great.

,jeffakajeff,2012-07-13T21:18Z,M)8/10 I enjoyed it and even watched it a 2nd time within the week! maybe i have to much free time but none the less it wasnt bad.
,Pedrojkan,2012-07-18T14:42Z,One of the better filmatizations of this epic novel! Most won't like it because it's not as tight or action packed as movies have to be in order to lure in the simpler minds. But for those familiar with Stevenson's book will be happily surprised by this movie's keeping with the original story.
