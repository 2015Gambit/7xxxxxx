,moeburn1,2012-07-10T12:36Z,"@filecheck,

I'm not sure how this gave you a trojan in your %appdata% directory when you have to copy/paste the files (no setup.exe) to your game directory.  Your real-time scanner would have found the game exe trying to clone itself to your appdata folder.

But anywho, I scanned mine with AVG free and found nothing, not even false positives.  Not sure how you got Medfos (IE homepage-changing virus), but I've gotten Medfos in the past from THETA torrents.

I downloaded this from rlslog's official link (not one of the links in comment section), I doubt they would be attaching viruses to releases."
,Syteri,2012-07-11T01:31Z,"This doesn't work for me. Each time I try to play the new map, my game crashes. The crash says ""Access Violation"""
,Syteri,2012-07-11T01:33Z,"Well, only the new map doesn't work. Trying out the old maps now and they seem to be okay. So for anyone who wants the new patch changes that come from the new update, dl this torrent."
,filecheck,2012-07-12T02:02Z,"Is there a way to go back and edit my previous comment post on this??
   anyway, Perhaps I jumped too soon and this torrent is not infected.. ill see if i get something this next time around.."
,moeburn1,2012-07-12T21:01Z,"no you can't edit posts, but I suspect that if someone is going to read enough comments to see someone saying its a virus, they're going to keep reading to see the responses to that claim."
,theurgy,2012-08-04T19:24Z,"Any idea what version this makes the game?

I want to download a trainer so I can cheat but I need to know the exact game version. I can't find it displayed anywhere in the game or in text files."
,theurgy,2012-08-04T19:31Z,"Nevermind, I found it. v12.07.02.470000045"
