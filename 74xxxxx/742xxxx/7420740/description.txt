Episode 16 : The Raids Against the Tirpitz

For the Germans, the giant battleship Tirpitz was the "Queen of the North" - a constant threat to the vital Allied convoys to Russia. For Churchill, she was "the Beast" - and one which must be destroyed at all cost. For more than three years RAF bombers, Fleet Air Arm dive bombers, and Royal Navy Chariots and X-craft mounted raids until Tirpitz was finally eliminated.
