,ultrababa,2012-07-08T00:07Z,Thanks man!
,NanoEntity,2012-07-08T03:23Z,"THIS CONTAINS UPDATE IN SEPARATE FOLDER

So you dont need to download whole thing if you have the game already."
,talkmedown,2012-07-08T07:44Z,Can you just upload the update? I don't want to have to download the game again.
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-07-08T08:12Z,"As NanoEntity aid, update is in separate folder. You can unmark the game and download the update only. "
,Podestabr,2012-07-08T09:04Z,"So, if you arleady have the game and want to download only the update here is what you have to do:
Since it is magnet link you cant choose what to download before starting it. So, as soon as your download starts (if you are using utorrent) pause it. On the botton part there is a lot of tabs, go to the tab files. There you are going to see all the files in the torrent. Select setup.exe, setup-1.bin and setup-2.bin, click with the right button and click on do not download.

Here is a post on utorrent forum with pics for who is not understanding (go to the second explanation..): http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=116430"

,Jona198102,2012-07-09T01:30Z,"This game is great. A few minor things here and there but still great.

So this is what Master of Orion 3 was supposed to be.. It's a really nice game!"
,nt.D,2012-07-11T23:11Z,"If your game has stopped on the initial screen, try to uninstall EVERY version of Microsoft Virtual C++ and then install ""vcredist_x86.exe"" (from 'redist' folder. It should work now (hopefully)"
,nt.D,2012-07-13T00:53Z,"I meant 'visual C++', not 'virtual' -.-"
,DJAknot,2012-07-13T06:04Z,When I run this I get a black screen crash which requires a hard reboot. Not even ctrl+alt+del works. I've tried the C++ redist fix with no results. Anyone?
,tihonya,2012-07-13T13:14Z,"Dibya , thanks for excellent upload.
Kind of unusual question - what's the song name used in the installer ? :)"
,Irishramb,2012-07-15T01:25Z,"Does this update (1.5) include the previous updates as well?

Also could you upload the 1.9 update too :) Or are you waiting? Not many changes in 1.9.

1.8 has a number of changes."
,Irishramb,2012-07-15T21:44Z,I forgot to say thank you for upload =)
,lazyrick,2012-07-18T15:05Z,"Thanks a million for the upload. One question though, instead of loading the in-game text, the game loads the variable of each text, such as %gameRequestOK, %gameBLABLABLA, and other. 

How can I resolve that problem? thanks."
,Bletisser,2012-07-18T15:33Z,I can not seem to open the .bin file. I am using daemon tools. Can anyone upload the redist subfolder for the fix? Please.
,Bletisser,2012-07-18T15:38Z,Thank you in advance.
,sjssaludez,2012-07-23T08:46Z,Good upload. Good game to kill time. Nice Job. +1
,indhoy,2012-07-26T23:01Z,"Having the same problem like Lazyrick, text, such as %gameRequestOK, %loadingScreen, %gameBLABLABLA, and other. Anyone know how to fix it?"
,GoggaIor,2012-07-28T04:20Z,"@tihonya Deadmau5 ft. Kaskade - I remember.

I was curious as well so I googled the lyrics I could make out.

@DibyaTPB: thanks for another perfect upload!"
