,machspee,2012-07-09T05:59Z,"holy shit. 3.4 GB file size for ONE episode?? Come on! What, are you  going to totally experience the episode pixel by pixel? 

ASAP version itself  looks awesome in my 30'' LCD TV."

If you don't understand what a TS is, don't comment. This isn't for you then."
,machspee,2012-07-09T08:43Z,"Yeah i get it.  Its the source of all the other uploads and that it is the format that is used for broadcasting.

Honestly though what do people with it? (who are downloading this torrent)

Its like using 100 toilet paper rolls after using the toilet once. "
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-09T10:42Z,"People can choose to watch it how it aired, or use it as a source to make their own encodes of the show for archiving. "
,parrumies,2012-07-09T14:45Z,"Technically speaking NOT as it was aired as silly americans use MPEG-2, not H264 for broadcast. So recompressed to H264. 

Size could be even smaller with deinterlace and reverse telecine => 24p but never mind. ""mind the gaps"" did that for couple of episodes."

,Shaktipat,2012-07-14T11:12Z,"Brilliant upload. thx.. :) I Don`t know what`s going on, but the quality is going down on so many upload these days... I`m willing to download almost any size, if the quality is as it is suppose to be. ;)"
