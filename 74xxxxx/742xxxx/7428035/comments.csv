,gaspo303,2012-07-10T13:38Z,"@saint. sync is not a major issue if you use vlc player right click the screen,select interface and go to track synchronisation. ill let u work it out from there. 


good torrent for a cam  v7 a6

thanks uploader."
,special_ed_420,2012-07-10T19:21Z,is there a horrible echo like all the other ones i've found??
,thebustanigga123,2012-07-10T19:28Z,"this movie woulda been way fucking better if quality was good, but luckily the dvd rip will be awesome. how long till it gets put up?"
,Fritz.,2012-07-10T21:14Z,"video is decent enough for a cam, audio is pretty bad.

i dont mean just the sync either. the audio just sounds bad and its hard to understand what people are saying, and in all the scenes with a lot of bass in the audio track its just awful.

as far as the sync goes, yes you can adjust it with vlc, but in the case of this movie you will need to constantly adjust it through the movie which is annoying, or just deal with it which is also annoying."

You know what i mean it's shot somewhere in India 
in this video some dude talking in the phone in Hindi 
Hindi was the official language in India"
