VLC 2.03 Beta 18Jul2012 32bit only (although should work in 64bit also)
(some new fixes like sound)


Latest VLC beta build - for me it fixed the weird sound silencing every 10 secends
issue or clicks I got for some Media type in 2.01 and 2.02 alpha releases
when playing in 1.5x times speed

I set cache to 100ms also

if you still have problems.. I suggest stick with 1.1.11 in windows xp win7 32bit
seemed the most stable for xvid avis

help to seed if grabbing

cheers
