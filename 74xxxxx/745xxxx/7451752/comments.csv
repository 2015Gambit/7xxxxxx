You could usefully follow scene rules and get the file size down to the low 300s with no discernible difference in quality
See http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2028
Honestly? If you really want to encode at 1500 kbps for video, you might as well up the image size to 720p. The overall result would probably be better, whether you played it at 720p or 480p size.
Not a biggy for me, since I have bandwidth. Just thinking of the brothers less fortunate ;-)"
