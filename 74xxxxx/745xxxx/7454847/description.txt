The origin of the Finnish hard rock band Random Eyes dates back to 1999 when guitarist Timo Kuusjarvie formed a friendship with vocalist Christian Palin while both were serving in the Finnish army.  After the two crossed paths again in 2002, Palin met vocalist Katja Rimpelainen and presented the idea to her of singing alongside him in a metal band.  Upon acquiring guitarist Mikko Tuliniemi (Hallowed), drummer Timo Peltokangas (also Hallowed) and bassist Jukko Koponen, the band officially assumed the name Random Eyes.
