[M],Agricola,2012-07-19T00:14Z,"DONT bring feuds from other sites into TPB or you will end up like 

JoShGaTeS  and  Rambo107 

sorry for posting this on your torrent psspss :)"
[V],psspss,2012-07-19T03:35Z,"whos feuding.. i aint got time for it

as I said i will be cutting back a bit now limiting on data more

I have to say DT been a let down so far.. and haunted highway is just a joke blair witchy thing

when you investigate outside all the time toyr going to always get glowing eyes .... OF DARN ANIMALS

im surprised they havent been attacked or eaten by a bear tiger or boar by now"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-07-19T05:57Z,I find it funny that you got a comment from a MOD but tne didn't.the worst part is that it was him & his followers that tried kickin' up dust with you & not the other way around.its good to see he pulled the stick out of his ass & started uploading again thou.the guy does great work when he's not being all emo about re-posting
[V],Masterzilla,2012-07-19T11:23Z,"PSSPSS, not you. Other 2 guys were taking trash here, they're removed now. Nobody cares whos ripping what and who's taking whos rips to get them here. They can do it somewhere else. You're doin a great job, and keep it up :)"
[V],psspss,2012-07-19T12:39Z,"I dont care about haters.. but wrong facts about me is annoying.

if I use tne source any more and know its his in future  I  will leave his tag in and mod it with src.. I dont think any capper wants their tag in a avi name if they didnt make  it.. espc if you fook it up
with corruption or bad OOS

I just like avi name to be for details not brag of source rights.. but thats me perhaps"
[V],psspss,2012-07-19T12:41Z,"its good to see hes sharing on p2p again

hes alot faster then the other cappers lately

i guess it depends how much free time you have and what country or state you live in or time zone "
[V],psspss,2012-07-19T12:45Z,"i dont see the need to delete people unless they just being a pain.. complaints or ratings on a torrent one expects if they valid.. sometimes I dont spot
OOS

I dont see why mod claimed was me to start feud I was just responding to initial posts was all.. oh well"
[V],psspss,2012-07-19T13:22Z,"i dont think rambo trashed me .. he was responding to their comments in defense I guess..

I never asked for anyone to be deleted or reported
p2p should be a free relaxed place to hang out

but I agree they need some rules like demon on comments here. I know pirates have no rules but
it would just full up their database with meanless comments

comments should be Q and As and ratings and help
or just about the torrent"
