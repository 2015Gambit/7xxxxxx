Hope not, given that there are .srt subs in the release.. Let us know, please"
,kepler42,2012-07-21T16:11Z,"yes, it has the same ""wired-in bright yellow subtitles"" which come with the BluRay, presumably!
It makes all other subs useless ! I would have thaought that a wise uploader as sadwabang would have mentioned it ! too bad!"
