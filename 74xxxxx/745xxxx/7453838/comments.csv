,LAS918,2012-08-01T15:43Z,"Trying to make a combo of US and Mexico from one of your other ul's.  Joined them using gmaptool and setting the the versionin header to 0.  Now how do I get the img file into mapsource so I can seltect the areas I want and upload the map?
Thanks!"

If you need a map with a ""custom"" selection of sub-maps, you have to use a Mapsource version instead of already compiled maps.
The ""unlocked IMG"" maps can't be loaded in Mapsource without loosing the address search function."
