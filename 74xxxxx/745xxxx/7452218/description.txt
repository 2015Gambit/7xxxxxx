From Fear to Eternity - The Best of 1990 - 2010 2011


From Fear to Eternity: The Best of 1990 - 2010 is a compilation album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, containing a selection of songs originally released on their last eight studio efforts to date. The title is lifted from the 1992 single, "From Here to Eternity", although it is not featured in this release.

The album was announced on 15 March 2011, to be released by EMI on 23 May,[1][2] although this was later changed to 6 June.[3] Unlike their previous compilation (Somewhere Back in Time), the release covered two CDs in order to encompass longer tracks, such as "Paschendale", although the price remained that of a single disc record.[4]
