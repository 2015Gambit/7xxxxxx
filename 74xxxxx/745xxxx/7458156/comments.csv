,notime4BS,2012-07-19T22:01Z,"This user's last upload was in 2010; seems like it might be a hacked account. In any event, the movie starts playing VOD in the states in another couple of weeks; better to wait for a proper VOD rip that will have English subs."
,OGBurn,2012-07-19T22:29Z,"Check it out before you comment, subs were easy to find..."
,OGBurn,2012-07-19T22:46Z,"Open your eyes before your mouth. NOTIME4BS 
Dean2804 subs were easy to find."
,ntongh2o,2012-07-19T23:47Z,Confirmed legit with good hardcoded subs. Speedy download too.
,dean2804,2012-07-20T00:37Z,"Well excuse me for being weary of an uploader I've never heard of who has no uploads and no one else has uploaded one with subs. I've been checking for english subs for the last few days and they're not easy to find. notime's response was perfectly reasonable.
I'll give this a go then but if it's fake, you can go fuck yourself. If it's real, then thanks, it's appreciated."
,Bandum,2012-07-20T01:54Z,"@dean2804
Dude! are you downloading with a 14.4 modem or what is your problem? It's 775mb!! Download it and see for urself if its fake or not. If comments here aren't clear you can do some manual labour urself you know that right? Lazy ass piece shit.

Thx for the upload OGBurn."
,dean2804,2012-07-20T04:53Z,"Bandum, it's not about the bandwith, dipshit. It's about wasting my time on a torrent that could be fake and may contain a virus.

Anyway, OGBurn looks like I owe you an apology. Thanks for the upload and sorry for not trusting you, but the amount of fakes on TPB makes me cautious."
,Captaint84,2012-07-22T00:18Z,Stupid question but how do I add the english subs to the movie?
,OGBurn,2012-07-22T22:56Z,"@Captiant84 - there already hard coded the english subs, you may have subtitles turned off on your TV possibility."
,Daedric_Overlord,2012-07-23T02:47Z,"Is it NYDIC's work with sub-titles hardcoded, just curious so I will know the quality?"
,OGBurn,2012-07-23T18:18Z,"Yes , Sir Correct NYDIC is source the NORDIC is typo..Thanks"
