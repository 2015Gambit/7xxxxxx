All praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. We cannot find
words to praise Him, AS He only sees fit how laudation should be addressed to
Him. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils within ourselves and the evils of our
bad deeds. Whosoever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whosoever He
leads astray will never find guidance. We bear witness that there is no god but
Allah, the One without any associate, and We bear witness that Muhammad is
His Messenger and bondman, peace and blessings be upon him, his kith and kin,
his Companions and all those who follow their guidance until the Day of
Judgment.
