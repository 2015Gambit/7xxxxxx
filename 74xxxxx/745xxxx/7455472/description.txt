Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Wednesday, July 18 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with former Senator John DeCamp, who wrote The Franklin Cover-up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraska. DeCamp's book covers the gruesome details of the Franklin scandal, a grotesque tale including drugs, Iran-Contra money-laundering, a nationwide child abuse ring, and ritual murder. DeCamp is a former member of the Nebraska Legislature and served as a lawyer for the Militia of Montana, a constitutional militia group in the 1990s. 

Alex also talks with Rosalind Peterson, president and co-founder of the Agriculture Defense Coalition. Peterson is a former certified USDA Farm Service Agency Agriculture Crop Loss Adjustor working in California. She specializes in protecting the environment from toxic chemical contamination and investigates ongoing, unregulated experimental atmospheric and weather modification programs. 

Alex also covers the latest from Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his bombshell revelations on Obama's fraudulent birth certificate.
