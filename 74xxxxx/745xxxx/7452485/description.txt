As with the previous volumes, youΓÇÖll again have the opportunity to hear Elvis at his best. Gone are the awful disproportional overdubs and gone is the muffled sound. All that remains is Elvis and his musicians having a ball in the studio, recording some great songs. The greatest surprise must be ΓÇ£Amazing GraceΓÇ¥ (take 2). Yes, we know that it has been released before. So we urge you to listen to that version first and then listen to our ΓÇ£blues versionΓÇ¥, wanna bet you wonΓÇÖt believe this is the same take? We are very proud we can present this version to you, but we feel itΓÇÖs a shame it hasnΓÇÖt been released decades ago! 

So get ready for some big surprises and donΓÇÖt spoil it for yourself by listening on your computer. This CD should be played on a real sound system, as loud as your neighbors allow. 

With covers! Enjoy!
