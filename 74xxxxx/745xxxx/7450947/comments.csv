,ca1981,2012-07-20T00:31Z,"thx for the up khushwant  :)

Dufox: Agreed  :)"
,obvious2me,2012-07-20T06:05Z,Clearly Kelathin was so furious after having mustered all of his strength to budge his boisterous wrist in order to move the trembling hand resting atop the mouse thus relocating the mouse cursor to the link and hauling his index finger to mouse1 in order to apply a gargantuan quantity of downward pressure to open the link that upon learning this was not the torrent he was looking for he felt the need to curse the uploader and command him to die.
,juvemp01,2012-07-20T09:54Z,Lulz @obvious2me. that's the funniest comment i've seen on here. Kelethin should practice what he preaches
,opensociety,2012-07-20T12:04Z,"Very fine comment obvious2me! :-) And to the point.

You, kelethin, should really give your brain a chance...! You should read the headings and look at size, this movie could not be only 54 megs in mkv format, no way. However, you don't have to fuck off and die, just learn, it is an exciting experience!

AND: Tnx to khuswant for this up! :-)"

,oviemayiefthay,2012-07-23T14:42Z,"So TPB is a great thing, that's a given.  In my case, it doesn't change my movie-going habits.  I went about once a month at most, and that stays the same with TPB.  If there were no TPB, my movie attendance would not change.  I assume this is the same for most.  when there is a great special effects flic, people will go to the movie for the real thing rather than than watching a cam version.  Not always the case, but I'm sticking to my guns... TPB doesn't change movie attendance.  I went to see this movie in theaters, and the place was packed, even 4 days after it opened.  

As for the movie, I recommend you go see this one in theaters.  The experience is great!  Yeah, there was the occasional cell phone going off (inconsiderate idiot), but you get that in a cam sometimes too.  

Some might wait for the DVD/BD version in TPB, and that's cool.  Just remember folks, we do need to go to the theaters every once in a while.  One, it gets you out of the house.  Two, if we stopped going to the theaters with any significance, Hollywood income would decrease.  this might result in a reduction of movies being made.  We love movies, let's keep 'em coming.  Go every once in a while, and get the rest here.
