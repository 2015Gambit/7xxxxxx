,notime4BS,2012-07-19T21:37Z,"Thank you for including screenshots. TvTeam uploaded this as well, but only included a sample, which turned out to be a movie trailer for a different movie, which led me to believe it wasn't legit. "
,notime4BS,2012-07-19T21:59Z,"The sample for this one is also a trailer for ""The Dark Knight Rises"", followed by a trailer for ""American Reunion"". What gives? Have you been hacked? "
