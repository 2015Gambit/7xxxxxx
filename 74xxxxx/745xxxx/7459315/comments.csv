,rjcripe,2012-07-21T08:54Z,"@train_wreq I had the same problem... thing is though, I play mine through a DVD player that only accepts AVIs and it seems that this is the only (seeded) AVI out there at the moment. Well, let me rephrase that: there are others but they're just clones of this upload here.
Oh well, I'll just convert the MP4 you linked to. If anybody else needs AVI PM me and if there is enough demand for it I'll upload and seed one for anyone else in similar situations."
