Swank is a pornographic magazine published in the United States. It includes hardcore sex, such as the use of sex toys, lesbian sex, and sexual intercourse between men and women.
 
There are also a series of DVDs and an official website produced under the Swank name.

The Magna Publishing Group bought Swank along with other titles, including Stag, in 1993 from Charles "Chip" Goodman, the son of Martin Goodman, founder of Marvel Comics. According to The New York Times, Stag and Swank "can even draw a line to the same pulp publishing outfitΓÇöMartin Goodman's Magazine Management CompanyΓÇöthat in 1939 started the comic book publisher that eventually became Marvel Comics, and that in the 1950s and 1960s employed future novelists like Mario Puzo and Bruce Jay Friedman as writers and editors." Beat poet John Fles also wrote for the magazine.
 
At the time Magna purchased the magazines from Goodman, the company was known as Swank Publications, and was a part of the GCR Publishing Group, which also published non-pornographic magazines, including such titles as New Body and Victorian Accents.
 
The Magna Publishing Group's website includes the claim that Swank has been established for "well over 65 years."

The magazine had breaks in publication of several years during its history
