However, PLEASE PLEASE, if the book is in COLOR, SCAN IT IN COLOR...and SCAN EVERY PAGE including the front matter.

If people don't mind downloading 2 and 3 gig movies, I don't mind downloading BIG books. If detail in lost from illustrations because its lost in back and white, the book, or sections or of it, become useless, and  A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MINE!

Thanks"

Otherwise great book!"
