Any news on ""MathtutorDVD Engineering Circuit Analysis Vol.2 ?"""
,varkstun,2012-07-20T20:37Z,"Could you upload ""The Skeptic's Guide to American History""?"
[V],dohduhdah,2012-07-20T22:24Z,"@indiaman: Sorry, no news on ""MathTutorDVD Engineering Circuit Analysis Vol.2"" yet.

@varkstun: I'll upload the audio edition of ""The Skeptic's Guide to American History"" soon (I haven't encountered the video edition yet)."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-07-20T22:50Z,"@indiaman: Oh, I see that Engineering Circuit Analysis Vol. 2 and Vol.3  have recently been uploaded and I'll try to share them here soon."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-07-21T18:59Z,"@indiaman: Oops. It looks like the torrent containing ""Engineering Circuit Analysis - Vol2 and Vol3"" has been prematurely removed from the torrent site because it wasn't in compliance with the rules. So I won't be able to download it and share it here. Sorry. I'll keep looking for an alternative copy."
,indiaman,2012-07-22T05:29Z,Thanks dohduhdah for keeping me updated on the Mathtutordvd Engg.Circuit Analysis Vol.2&3 upload.I sure hope you find it soon and upload it soon.
[V],dohduhdah,2012-07-26T23:42Z,"@indiaman: It turns out the torrent wasn't removed. The seeder was just temporarily away. Seeding is going very slow however, but I expect to be able to share those engineering circuit analysis tutorials within a week or so, if everything goes ok."
,RMK.Ultra,2012-08-13T23:05Z,Thank you for a great upload! Cheers.
,FreiTod,2012-09-07T05:42Z,Thanks very much indeed.
