Michael WoodΓÇÖs mammoth serial on India is a tale, lovingly told, of incredible dreams,
diversity and creativity.
Michael Wood is ecstatic about the reactions to his mammoth six-hour, six-part television series, ΓÇ£The Story of IndiaΓÇ¥. He
had been dreaming of this project for 15 years, and when it came through, all he had to do was pack his bags and co me to
India and shoot for 20 months. Sounds easy! But, for Wood, it was the most daunting task to condense such a vast history
into six hours, yet say it all with feeling and factual accuracy. With this series he has drawn more than his usual fans into the
magical ring that only he is capable of creating. Says Wood: ΓÇ£It was a big responsibility. We love India so much, even six
hours seemed not enough. We wanted to do much more. I canΓÇÖt wait to get back to India again and do a Nataraja series.ΓÇ¥
