Bikaner-based 28-year-old Dilip Kumar Singh     
is enrolled in a Rajpur-based Law college, and  
rents a room with an unstable male, Rananjay    
Singh. His attempts to re-locate to a hostel,   
pits him against a group of men, led by Jadhwal,
who not only assault, but also molest him,      
and then lock him in a dark room with a naked   
and abused female, Anuja. He recuperates in a   
hospital and joins hands with Rananjay and      
Dukey Bana to avenge this humiliation, as       
well as befriends Anuja, who is a Lecturer      
in the college. He also decides to support      
Rananjay, who is legitimate son of a former     
Raja, to run for college elections - and it     
is this decision that will shatter and change   
his life forever.
