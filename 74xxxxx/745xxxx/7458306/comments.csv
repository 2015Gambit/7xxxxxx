,klip1,2012-07-21T03:19Z,"after seeing these comments, do I dare even ask if these are affiliated with the original jurassic park trilogy?"
,klip1,2012-07-21T03:20Z,"""I watched it the other day and this Shark is about 7ft in height...but managed to sneak up and attack Two women in around 2ft of water all without being seen....""

pass.

not even going to watch unless i see some better comments..."
,pirateglitch,2012-07-21T12:25Z,this movie is fuckin lame. waste of time. 
,KKKDownlow,2012-07-22T03:06Z,This movie is for people that are into the unrealistic shark movies like Jaws.
,Yol_Gezer,2012-07-22T11:05Z,"100% B Movie meh I expected better. Seems they just had a lil house buged.

M:1 on normal scala and 5 for a B movie"
,Yol_Gezer,2012-07-22T11:22Z,"@KKKDownlow Comeon even jaws was more realistic

@klip1 Yeah that part was funny but there is an more funnier part where 1 guy throws a girl in the watter and the shark comes by with more than half of its body out of watter snifs the girl and eats her in 1 bite. Either the girl is just a lil kid or the sharks size is changeing all over the movie.

Anyway;

,Greggo79,2012-07-22T15:38Z,"This movie is amazing. I think it's better than The Shawshank Redemption as far as direction and acting. The plot is intense and the cinimatography is spot on. 
10/10

M- unratable.

Any rating scheme used against this movie does not have a -ve number large enough to do justice to this films lack of any merit whatsoever.  Acting is juvenile, camera work appalling, script pathetic and special effects less than I would expect from myself.  

In all, a movie you have to watch, just to see how badly a movie can be made.  I hope someone is eventually shot for this travesty."

,dudezprod,2012-07-23T15:17Z,"Hi all, 
I directed this movie. Clearly some of you didn't get the joke that this movie is supposed to be cheesy and silly (it IS called Jurassic Shark after all), but that's ok.
What bugs me though is how many people are downloading the movie illegally. I'm an indie guy and made this movie for peanuts out of my own pocket. I have a family to feed, same as you guys. If folks who are downloading it would be cool enough to paypal me even a buck for their download, that would be appreciated. Find me at www.brettkelly.net
you can hate the movie if you want or love it if you want, but making movies is expensive and long hours, be cool about it. thanks!"

,patolya,2012-07-29T17:33Z,"The dumbest movie ever, what a waste of film, must be a $1000 budget movie at large, lol..."
