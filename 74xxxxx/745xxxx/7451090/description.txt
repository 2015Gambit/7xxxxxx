Science - tricky enough with a white coat, top-of-the-range instruments and a warm lab. But what would happen if you took a team of scientists, dumped them in an unforgiving environment and told them to get on with it? 

This is the complete Rough Science series from the BBC / Open University.  The episodes have been compiled from various sources and the quality varies by episode, however it is complete.

Special thanks to frednd for uploading the rest of the series to allow me to fill in some of the blanks with my own captures / compilations.
