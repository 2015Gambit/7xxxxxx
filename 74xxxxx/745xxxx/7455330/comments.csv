1st, about a week ago, I searched TPB for NatGeo and  found & D/L'd Himmler's SS Cult.
Now tonight, I go to download Season 2 of Bob's Burgers and I notice a comment. Purely out of a rare sense of curiosity, I click the name- thinking to myself, ""let's see... Who's this 'Masterzilla' Character""?
Sure enough, one of the 1st torrents I see in your list of uploads is none other than Himmler's SS cult.
I would say ""small world"", but... TPB is just one website. And even a coincidence as large as this isn't gonna make me refer to it as a ""small site""."
