Quite a bit of interest for Vol 1 So I have decided to upload all 4 in the series.   the Old Grey Whistle Test was a TV Music show which ran for over 15 years on the minority channel BBC2.   Acts which would normally be ignored a public platform were made most welcome and it was not long before this show and its presenters achieved Cult like status.

On this compilation watch out for Meatloaf's legendary performance of 'Paradise By The Dashboard Light' which featured a 135 second Snog (Kiss) and Grope which few (if any) other public service broadcasters would have allowed at that time.

This is more than just 'Music' this is theatre and if you are not stirred or shaken by some of these tracks then I will be very surprised.   when you think just about all these acts were new at the time and the BBC took a huge risk giving them a public platform, the fact that most of them are still producing, and in some cases performing music in 2012 is a great tribute to the team behind the Old Grey Whistle test way back when...
