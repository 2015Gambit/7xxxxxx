Tommy makes it home and gets out of his clothes to take a shower. It's hot out there and he needs to cool off. Little does he know things are about to get even hotter. He stands under the showerhead as he gets all wet. When he goes to lather up the soap is missing so he calls for his roomie to bring him some soap.
