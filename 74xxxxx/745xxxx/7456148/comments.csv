,Dimmis80,2012-07-19T10:32Z,Hey friend Nepotu.I can see that u are busy and u giving us new games and stuff already.To be honest from my point of view i loved all the games and playofs-finals but i am more of regular season with the teams with their big names and stars playing.Or older games like i told u before.I don't want to be pushy but just to remind u about the older games u know with Jordan-Detroit Pistons/Grand Hill or i will be happy with watever u can find..I hope u will find the time with this summer league for that games to.And my humble opinion is that a lot of people like to watch older games.!Cheers.

Currently I'm watching 1992 NBA Dream Team in the 1992 OG, but this wasn't real backetball, this had been - backetball lesson from NBA stars for other teams. Greetings"
