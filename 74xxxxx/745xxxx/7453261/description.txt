Love Actually... Sucks! is a 2011 Hong Kong movie, directed by award-winning Hong Kong Chinese film producer Scud (Danny Cheng Wan-Cheung Σ║æτ┐ö). It was released at the 47th Chicago International Film Festival, in October 2011. It explores several themes traditionally regarded as 'taboo' in Hong Kong society, in an unusually open, convention-defying way, featuring frequent full-frontal male and female nudity, and is one of four such films by Scud. The three earlier ones are: City Without Baseball, released in 2008, Permanent Residence in 2009, and Amphetamine in 2010.

Plot

Love Actually... Sucks! was inspired by real-life events, and opens with a dramatic wedding feast. It tells a variety of stories about love that has gone wrong: a brother and sister in an illicit relationship, a married painter who falls in love with his young male life model, a dance school teacher who is besotted with his senior student, and a lesbian couple, one of whom has role-play paranoia, and is caught in a complex love triangle. The film celebrates the belief that life is love.
