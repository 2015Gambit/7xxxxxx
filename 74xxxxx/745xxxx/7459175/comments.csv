I've actually remuxed audio from avi's and video from your mp4's to make a new mkv... so please... on action movies the sound pops really bad with aac... so if you can/or noticed it yourself make the audio quality better or just use mp3(mpeg) audio... thanks for and consideration!!"
,kinglaw25,2012-07-20T10:36Z,*any consideration!!
