This intriguing documentary series examines freak occurrences in the natural world. Whether it's animals behaving oddly or even the planet that perplexes, each episode sees scientists studying baffling phenomena in a bid to understand what Mother Nature's really up to. The reasons behind incidents will vary, but there's one conclusion that we always reach: the world isn't as predictable as we'd like to think.



Episode 1 : The Revengeful Elephant 

This episode examines violent cattle and rhino deaths which took place across a large area of Africa in the early 1990s. Locals and scientists came to believe that the perpetrators were elephants seeking revenge against Maasai villagers who had previously been responsible for barbarous behaviour towards elephants, as evidence suggested they being specifically targeted for retribution.
