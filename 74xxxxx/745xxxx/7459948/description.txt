Episode 2 : Killer Whale Attack

This episode explores the life of the killer whale. In Mother's Day 2004 a grey whale is spotted from aboard popular tourist boat. Enthusiastic passengers enjoy the scene, but then it suddenly turns to a bloodbath when a pod of orcas launch a coordinated attack on a grey whale and her calf. It's first in a long chase. Streamlined and cunning, killer whales have many hunting techniques. They live and hunt together in cooperative pods much like a pack of wolves, and work together as they hunt.
