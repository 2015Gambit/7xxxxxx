Hey, Listen!

This is a small fix i made due to some locals (aka People in the Republic) complaining about the lack of a shortcut to PWADs folder.

So, to fix this, just open the program, insert your "id-tech 1 Collection" installation folder and click on "Fix it!".

A shortcut will be placed in the Start Menu -> id-tech 1 along with the other shortcuts

Yay, everyone's happy, right AndreVoidelo? >:(

Again, don't seed, or you'll be helping others and... to mankind, this is a horrible thing...
