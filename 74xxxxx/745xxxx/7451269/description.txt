DESCRIPTION:

Do you know what quatrefoil and impolitic mean? What about halcyon or narcolepsy? This book is a handy, easy-to-read reference guide to the proper parlance for any situation. In this book you will find: Words You Absolutely Should Know (covert, exonerate, perimeter); Words You Should Know But Probably Don?t (dour, incendiary, scintilla); 
Words Most People Don?t Know (schlimazel, thaumaturgy, epergne); Words You Should Know to Sound Overeducated (ad infinitum, nugatory, garrulity); Words You Probably Shouldn?t Know (priapic, damnatory, labia majora); and more. Whether writing an essay; studying for a test; or trying to impress friends, family, and fellow cocktail party guests with their prolixity, 
you will achieve magniloquence, ebullience, and flights of rhetorical brilliance.
