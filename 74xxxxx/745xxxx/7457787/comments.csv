,babycakers,2012-08-17T10:49Z,My computer detected a virus and removed it right away. Which I am surprised coming from a Wendy99 torrent. 
,michfe2403,2012-08-17T15:34Z,"That's true. There is a virus. File get's deleted right away. Still, many people downloading it. They either hope for the best or believe the people who said they had no virus detected and played the game till the end. Well,- not the game is clean as by magic when you downloaded it...-your AV-programme is shit and didn't detect it. Have fun with your trojan horse."
