"The Bribe"

Now that Steve owns the bar he needs to set 
boundaries with his parents. When the health 
inspector shows up Ok Cha (series regular Jodi 
Long) wants to pay him off, but Steve refuses 
and the bar is shut down for the first time 
ever. Without the bar, everyone seems lost 
except for Owen (series star Owen Benjamin) who 
discovers surprisingly productive ways to spend 
his time.
