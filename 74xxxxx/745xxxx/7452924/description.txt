Survival of the sexiest 

Much like the first movie, this one claims to have a certain darkness to it. Predator 2 pulled it off better but still wasn't quite there. I have a real hard time taking Stormy Daniels seriously as a psychopath, she seems way to approachable. The movie didn't go out of it's way to make her seem as crazy as was implied on the DVD case. Outside of that, the movie is still worth watching and has many points that make up for the lack of being the erotic thriller it claims to be. The movie also goes through pains to leave things open for a sequel, which was just filmed (Sept 2008). Both written and directed by Stormy Daniels, Predator 2 is an all girl feature that will make fans of Stormy Daniels and those into girl on girl action very happy.
