,silver2006,2012-07-17T19:48Z,"No, I unfortunately don't have the cd, This is just the first legit d/l I was able to come across. But if anyone knows if there is a website that has a high quality stream of the whole album and not just the previews, I can rip it. Otherwise we'll just have to wait for someone else to do a HQ version."
