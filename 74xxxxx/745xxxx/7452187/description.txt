Ram Jaane is arrested by a security guard

best friend. He is shortly released and becomes
one of the biggest hustlers in the city.       
After a deadly shootout, he is arrested by     
a corrupt police department and sent to jail   
again. After a few years of serving jail       
time, he goes back to the streets and          
to his friend's place. There he decides        
to help him raise the local kids in the area   
so they won't be corrupted by the streets.     
He quickly falls in love with a childhood
