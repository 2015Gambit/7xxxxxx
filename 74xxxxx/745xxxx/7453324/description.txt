Audience is a cult British art rock band which existed between 1969 and 1972, and reformed in 2004.

The original band consisted of Howard Werth (born Howard Alexander Werth, in 1947, The Mother's Hospital, Clapton, East London) on nylon-strung electric acoustic guitar and vocals, Keith Gemmell (born Keith William Gemmell, 15 February 1948, Hackney Hospital, Hackney, East London) on tenor sax, flute and clarinet, bass guitarist and vocalist Trevor Williams (born Trevor Leslie Williams, 19 January 1945, Hereford, Herefordshire, and drummer/vocalist Tony Connor (born Anthony John Connor, 6 April 1947, Romford, Havering).

The House on the Hill is the third album by British art rock band Audience and was released in 1971. At about the same time, a single "Indian Summer" reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. The North American version of The House on the Hill on Elektra Records added "Indian Summer" as the opening track, along with "It Brings A Tear" which had already appeared on the UK album Friend's Friend's Friend. The Elektra LP dropped the song "Eye To Eye".

Both the UK and North American LPs were originally issued as gatefold. The UK gatefold contains black-and-white photos of each band member. The Elektra Records gatefold contains the album lyrics with a photo of the "house on the hill" in the background. The Elektra LP was later reissued in the early 1980s, non-gatefold.

The 1991 Virgin Records UK CD release, issued in the U.S. on Caroline Records, used the UK. LP track listing, adding the single "Indian Summer" to the end of the album. The Elektra Records version of The House On The Hill has never been issued on CD.
