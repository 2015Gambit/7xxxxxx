but the movie is good quality  A:9 V:9"
,DANIELGAITS,2012-07-20T07:34Z,Subtitles?
,3juddy3,2012-07-20T11:37Z,"Cast: Alexander Skarsg책rd, Brooklyn Decker and Liam Neeson..... yeah right..."
,Kobraman88,2012-07-22T00:14Z,"A-8 V-8 
great quality but the film is cinavia protected so stops about 20mins into watching on a ps3"

,thenaughtons,2012-07-22T13:15Z,"Awesome Quality!

V 10
A 10
M 6 Full tilt stoner flick. well filmed, very witty, seemed to spoof a lot of other movies, but for the most part enjoyable.......just thaught that the alien thing was a bit silly."
,B3amMeUp,2012-07-22T13:54Z,"V = 9

A = 9 

M = 9/10 - NO MATTER HOW MANY TRAILERS OR PREVIEWS YOU READ, THIS MOVIE WILL STILL SURPRISE YOU. I could see this being a love/hate it type movie and a future cult classic. the directing, acting, writing, cinematography is great, but it's fast paced, sorta incoherent, etc. I would say the closet movie to it would be Scott Pilgrim, but still, this is a movie you have to see and judge for yourself.

,jundamane,2012-07-24T12:27Z,"You will either love or hate this film, I absolutely loved it. Great direction, rapid fire dialogue and heaps of pop culture references (bonus points for the awesome David Cronenberg homage). Good quality, but i just downloaded the blu-ray rip and it's amazing"
,moviemansteve,2012-08-03T17:31Z,"@ kobramann, i have noticed that most bdrips are cinevia protected. but thats just my opinion. i have seen some that are not. but most are."

,resweb,2012-08-28T03:19Z,"this has CINAVIA so is useless on a PS3

A: -1
V: 8"
,Future_TV,2012-09-12T18:44Z,This movie is bizarre and makes little to no sense. I loved it!
