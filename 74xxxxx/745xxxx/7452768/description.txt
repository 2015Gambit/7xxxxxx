A complete Neverwinter Nights 2 (OC, MotB, SoZ) Windoze package installed under Wineskin for emulation on the Mac.  This package also includes Wineskin Winery, with a few older version of the Wrapper and Engine.

Unpacked, it is 13GB.  I broke it down into 100mb segments using 7z compression.  You'll need a 7z utility to unpack and un-segment.

I've stripped all the *.ini files of information, so you'll have to provide your own set of 3 CD keys, Gamespy user name, etc.

Also, there are no PW files, so you'll have to download those as well.  I guess that goes without saying, but....

Furthermore, after stripping the package of all extraneous and incriminating information, I haven't actually tested if it works.  

Good luck!
