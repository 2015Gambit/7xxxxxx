Hello! This is an update for "Eminem Complete Discography (1989-2012)"

I have updated "The Man In The Mirror" and put them in seperate folders with album covers. The Man In The Mirror is now including all the Eminem songs from 8 Mile Soundtrack and The Re-Up. It also includes the new songs that where on Curtain Call: The Hits. 

It's also an update of "Freestyles" with a few more songs. It's now entitled "The Freestyle Show".

So if you downloaded my other torrent, just delete "The Freestyles", "The Man In The Mirror", "8 Mile EP", "The Re-Up" and "Curtain Call: The Hits" and download this torrent, then your Eminem collection shoul'd be complete. :) PEACE!
