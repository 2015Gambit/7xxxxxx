POtHS Comments on This one: Very Good.

Description:

GROWING KIDS GOD'S WAY (Along the Virtuous Way) 5.0 series is a comprehensive values-based parenting curriculum. In the title the authors, Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo, place their emphasis on God's Way meaning the way of the Lord. We serve an ethical God. Moral rightness flows from His being. His moral law is a reflection of His holy character (Psalm 19:7). More than that, He has shown man what is good and what is required of him (Micah 6:8). Growing Kids God's Way can help any parent reach the heart of children with virtues and values that flow from the character of God and do it without stressing the child or the parents.

Utilized by more than 9,000 churches and schools worldwide and serving over 1.7 million households, there is a reason why this core curriculum is so popular: it's practical and the applications work. The curriculum is designed for small group studies or can be utilized by individuals in the privacy of their own home.

Topics include:

   How to help children internalize virtues and values and how to help them practically live out the character of God in their life.
   What parents do to foster insecure children and how they can fix the problems that might now exist.
   How to say "I love you" to your children and spouse in such a way that each member actually feels the full sensation of parental love.
