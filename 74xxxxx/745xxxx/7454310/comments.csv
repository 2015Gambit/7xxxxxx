,nilukashi,2012-09-18T20:10Z,"Hi Almost D 

I cannot import any object to AE through 3D element. these are the steps I do

1)opening AE
2)make a solid layer
3)then add element effect to that solid layer 
4)click on scene set up and select an object
5)then add a material
6)then hit ok.

but it doesnt show any object in after effects view 

ps> I have installed all 6 packs & proshade as well but really fkd up with this matter"
