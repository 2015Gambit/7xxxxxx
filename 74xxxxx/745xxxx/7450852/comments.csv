,brizownthepi,2012-07-21T05:55Z,"May have thanked prematurely - starmartyr, can you check this out? I've been stuck at 0.4% since the 17th. Thanks... been looking forward to this, by far their best!"
,starmartyr,2012-07-24T09:29Z,"Sorry brizownthepi, it may be not enough seeds, weird since I let it DL 3-4x over.. but I haven't been on that much lately so it could be that. I'll try to leave it on seeding some more for the next few days. Let me know what happens."
,starmartyr,2012-07-24T09:30Z,That should be that I let it UL 3-4x over... but you knew that ;)
,brizownthepi,2012-07-30T09:43Z,"awesome, I'm trying again."
