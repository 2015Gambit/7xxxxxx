You really need to take a look at existing torrents for these as many of the ones you are posting are quite old and already here. :)"
,Spiritualflame,2012-07-17T22:23Z,"Already here? Where?

I always Search first.
Unless I am very much mistaken, this Is the first UL of Paloma B Presenting."

Do appreciate your efforts though..."
,Spiritualflame,2012-07-18T01:47Z,":/  Paloma B, 2 sets is not very helpful.. 

Not when entering ""Paloma B Presenting"" into the search engine.
His image hosting link gives a 404 lol. not very helpful either.
I search for the Model, and Set, if nothing comes up, I have to presume it's not here.

I am unwilling to waste time doing more  detailled searching, as it should not be necessary, or to waste any more bandwidth  :(

Fuck the haters!  I love your uploads and i truly appreciate it.  Even if the sets have already been uploaded, its good to have them re-upped for fresh seeders and people who don't search for stuff (like me, i usually only download popular torrents)"
,Middevyl,2012-07-18T18:38Z,"I also love these older sets, keep up the good work!"
