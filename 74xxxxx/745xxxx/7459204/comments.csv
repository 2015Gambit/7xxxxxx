,balaguitar,2012-07-20T13:53Z,Good job Modrishark :) Jamtrackcentral are certainly one of the best. Waiting if someone could find Alex Hutchings and Guthrie Govan stuff :) Since it isn't available anywhere on the net except that shop :D
,RecycleBin32,2012-07-20T16:32Z,"Thanks Modrishark :D
And the Full Shread Ahead lessons, about that..
1st two are available everywhere. 3rd and ahead are hard to find. thanks for the efforts though :D"
,RecycleBin32,2012-07-20T16:37Z,"Thanks Modrishark :D
Though about that Full Shred Ahead lessons. First two are available everywhere. But 3rd and ahead is what I'm looking for. :)
Thanks for your efforts man :D"

RecycleBin32
just trying to help :)"
,balaguitar,2012-07-21T05:57Z,"Hey Modrishark,
No. I don;t think any stuff from guthrie and JTC. It isn't available anywhere for download. Just waiting if someone could upload it :)"
,balaguitar,2012-07-21T05:59Z,I am having Guthrie improvising some blues jam tracks which was uploaded way long ago. I am assuming even you have that one. For some stupid reason I am unable to mention the torrent site (even with spaces) nor of course copy the link. :( Damn..
,balaguitar,2012-07-21T06:01Z,"And Wespaul,

   Big thanks to you too. Do upload if you get more stuffs from Jamtrackcentral :) Thanks :)"
