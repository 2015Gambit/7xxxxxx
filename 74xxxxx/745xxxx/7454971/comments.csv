,4gregu,2012-07-19T15:53Z,I want to thank you so much for putting these up. Last season I had such a hard time finding the AD's. Keep up the great work!!!

to NeoJoe090..The sync problem is from BB production not Showtime. Rumor has it half their staff went to Glass House and now their control room is an unprofessional mess.  Also they haven't up-graded their cameras to HD"
