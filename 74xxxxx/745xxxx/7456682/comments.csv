,Dalet19,2012-07-25T04:05Z,Why does it say RC2 in the menu?
,dododey,2012-07-26T02:39Z,How did you crack the game to make this torrent? Did you set it up as a project in an IDE and then edit the authentication class? I can't seem to get that option to work.

Just a note to everyone this IS NOT the official RC2.5 that came out around the 24th, but there is a new copy of the official RC2.5 being uploaded right now download the official one here.

,metalpwns,2012-09-12T07:09Z,"For people getting ia 32 bit .dll error you have to download java 7 32 bit and edit the bat file to point to the 32 bit version of java.This game only works with the 32 bit version of java and the file path is 

C:Program Files (x86)Javajre7binjava.exe

or whatever letter your drive is that java is on."
