Project Zomboid 0.2.0r RC2.5 iwith crack

This is pz rc2.5 for windows. if your all whaaa???

Lemmy posted the Mac/linux versions of rc2 on the game forums and it caught my eye when he said its a "hybrid of RC2 & RC3"
Sooo... simply put it has some stuff added for RC3 that isnt in RC2 yet, what all is added to it you ask?
well i have no f#$@n idea lol.

I DO know it has the tutorial and kate back which werent in RC2 so thats something, there may be more.

I edited the linux version to work on windows just run the batch file to play, read the notes.txt included are the notes for the old crack which still works and some new notes.

I'm kinda curious so post comments on any new stuff you find on TPB if anything for all i know though it could be just kate though.
