A space ship with 40 passengers glides silently in a dark and silent universe. Suddenly, they end up in the middle of an exploding meteor shower and seriously injured. The craft are forced to crash land on the nearest planet, a planet that turns out to have three suns that highlights the planet around the clock.

Among those who survive crash landing are pilot Carolyn, police Johns and his prisoner Riddick, a convicted murderer who through an eye operation has had the ability to see in the dark. It soon appears to be very useful when the three suns suddenly find themselves in a row with a total solar eclipse as a result.

Riddick takes the opportunity to escape under cover of darkness. Meanwhile, other creatures come to life in the black emptiness. It is the planet's native people who live and hunt their food here ...
