FalconFourΓÇÖs Ultimate Boot CD/USB 4.5


At last, for your enjoymentΓÇª the latest version of FalconFourΓÇÖs Ultimate Boot CD has arrived. V4.5 may be just a 0.5 version bump, but there is so much good stuff in here, lots of changes and lots of cool new toys to play with.

In this boot CD are the most popular and useful tools anyone would ever need. The best of the free software, the best of the commercial software, and it all fits on one CD-R thatΓÇÖs readable by any computer worth booting on. Not everything can read a DVD, and USB booting is hit and miss at best.

ItΓÇÖs been a long time. How have you been? Things have changed since we last metΓÇª I got myself a corporate IT job, still doing computer repair on the side. But being a side thing, kinda has its pros and cons. On one hand I donΓÇÖt have constant first-hand experience using the disc anymore. On the other hand, I can also take a step back and look at it from a designerΓÇÖs point of viewΓÇª how well does it work? What does it do good, whatΓÇÖs bad, what could be done better? How can I make this the ULTIMATE BOOT CD it claims to be?

This disc, a minor half-version revision, is the answer to those questions. Scoured through every option, considered the usefulness of some tools, added others, collaborated with users over Facebook, gutted some functions and built others. A launcher here, a script there, and about 1,500 WIM captures. I imagine I went through some 20 ISO re-burns, 150 virtual machine boots, 200 VHD mount/unmountsΓÇª I canΓÇÖt even count how much time has been put into polishing this thing. All for the love of making computer repair accessible to anyone that wants it.
