Warriors of the Wind was a 1985 dub of Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind...    later  released in 2005 as Nausicaa by Disney.      

I used the VHS audio from Warriors of the Wind  and Cut up the 1080p video from the bluray to Create the unique  remastered release of Warriors of the wind.

I understand many Ghibli fans hate this version of the film but when viewing both dubs... the 85 dubbing was just soo much better.. *imo very sad considering who all they had in the disney dub*    I will admit many of the scenes should not have been cut and I am very tempted to do another version  adding as many scenes as I cant later on...

This release was meant for the Nostalgic fans of the 85 dub  and the people who grew up on the 70-80s anime dubs   

I very much hope you enjoy this release and keep it alive
