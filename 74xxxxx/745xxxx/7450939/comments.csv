,ziggyff,2012-07-17T07:41Z,"FaMoUz, how can you have a DVDrip of a show just aired  2 hours ago for the first time ??"
,BoonesFerry,2012-07-17T08:55Z,"Mislabeled as episode 14
This is episode 13

ziggy, dvd's are often leaked a week or two before they go on sale. nothing new. "
[V],FaMoUz,2012-07-17T08:57Z,the same way the release groups get movies early like R5 n DVDSCREENERS.. season 5 dvd is 2 b released 2day july 17th i got those episodes last week.. so the release group INQUISITION got ahold of the dvd early ripped it n uploaded it.. i waz the first 2 make it a torrent
,miamisunset,2012-07-17T13:31Z,"The confusion between E13 and E14 had to do with the Christmas episode which is listed as episode 1 of season 5, making this episode 14. There's the Christmas episode + 13 regular episodes."
,biggggdan,2012-07-18T00:04Z,"i dont really understand the confusion last week the guys who released episode released episode 12, so this week they are like hmmm?  we are on 14 now right?    not sure why they didnt just look at least ep they released lol o well.  ty for up though."
,Sick3r,2012-07-18T01:56Z,"Same as episode 13.. Don't download.
