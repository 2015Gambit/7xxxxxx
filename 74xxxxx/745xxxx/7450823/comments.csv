Did you do that yourself or something ?"
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T07:40Z,huh? i think 1000 have downloaded it now
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T07:59Z,"i forgot dimension was the mkv 720p source for this..
not sure why not added to tpb yet though,,
as I dont do big files like that only xvids

i knew people were waiting for it to appear on p2p so I shared some of my costly bandwidth again on it 
I see lol mp4 and others now have a source up too"
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T09:08Z,"and NO I didnt tick quality at all.. can you actually do that? surely tpb bars that on own torrents..
anyhow"
,Random-User,2012-07-17T09:15Z,"Cheers for the up, dont spose you have Bush Pilots s01e09 ?

It has been here for a few days under TvTeam but no farken seed. "
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T09:34Z,:O
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T09:37Z,hmm comments wont always show here lately. very odd
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T09:39Z,"most to tvteam comes from torrentday private tracker.. i havent a invite or member but you could ask about.. it will be there no doubt and seeded
they just leak them to tpb to get exposure it seems
hit and runs are bad here though

I dont watch it though or have it"
,xpmule,2012-07-17T11:52Z,"any open tracker is like that.. nothing new
personaly i don't care who seeds.
don't expect people to do it lol

i belong to many private invite only sites and i prefer open trackers :)

and psspss you know as well as i do 
what i was talking about.. obviously someone gave you a +1 when it seemed fishy because obviously no one could have finished your download yet ;) but uhhh yeah whatever lol

also if you are getting complaints from your isp and your constantly pleading with people to seed your torrents maybe you should consider not uploading the ones released by scene groups..
The same time i seen you post this, i seen group LOL release it as they did last week and the week before etc etc
Its obvious to me when they are coming, its rare for scene groups to miss an episode on a popular show.

@random_user
i see it listed on the search site www-filestube-com"
,Random-User,2012-07-18T00:07Z,"I use TD myself but it isn't listed there. I see alot of stuff from TvTwats ULed here with TD links all over it but not all of it ever hits TD....


Thanks for the link to FT, sadly, all are funny file sites wanting sign-ups. Torrents fopr me only.

Cheers."
[V],psspss,2012-07-18T04:44Z,"no scene release xvid ???? and afg hadnt and
no guarantee when anyone would.. so alas I had
before the mass of pms started on the comments or pms at demon

and wasnt same time.. they appear maybe 1 hour after.. even if a source exists else where no one
bother to share their expensive data cap either to 
the p2p community

the prob with tvteam and some of the others
they leave them as rars or dont seed the torrents here.. people hit and run on those ones alot

you cant trust the stats.. if says 10 seeders often its just one.. and if it says 0 seeders sometimes it has many so fishy or not"
