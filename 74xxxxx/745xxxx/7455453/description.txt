Turn Back Time: The High Street
The High Street was once the heart and soul of every town in Britain. Not anymore. But what if we could turn back time, to the days of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker? The story of the rise and fall of the great British high street is brought to life in an entertaining and ambitious new series that transports four empty shops and a group of modern shopkeepers and their families back to the birth of the high street in the 1870s, before propelling them through a century of dizzying change, right up to the 1970s. Over six hours of gripping television, the families lives are turned upside down as they experience how shopkeepers lived and worked in six key eras of British history.



2)  Edwardian Era 
In this episode they're moving into to the elegance of the Edwardian era. The butcher, the baker, the grocer and the ironmonger are joined by a dressmaker and together they must provide a modern town with the exceptional service and luxuriant shop displays worthy of the Edwardians. The baker's family find themselves running an Edwardian tea shop, while the butchers must sell game in all its gory glory to modern customers. The grocer has trained staff but the challenge of creating an early 20th century wedding breakfast piles on the pressure. All the shopkeepers struggle with maintaining standards and it becomes clear that underneath its glossy veneer the Edwardian high street was a tough place for women and children. The arrival of call up papers reminds the traders and the town of the terrible impact that World War One had on our communities.
