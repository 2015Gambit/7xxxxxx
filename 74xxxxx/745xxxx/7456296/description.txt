Gary Numan - Metal [Thames TV promo].VOB


Very HQ promo music video from a promo DVD. "Metal" is a song by Gary Numan from his 1979 album The Pleasure Principle, the third studio album, and debut album under his own name.

Lyrically the song is science fiction, inspired by the works of Phillip K Dick and William S. Burroughs, and is about an android who wishes to be human, but never can be.

The song has been a regular feature at Numan's live shows since his first tour in 1979, and appears on the majority of his live albums.
In 1981 Numan wrote new lyrics to the tune of "Metal" for his album Dance, and renamed the song "Moral". Numan often performs this version. The song was reworked into his aggressive new style in 1998, and this version is still being performed today. "Metal" has been covered by many artists, including Nine Inch Nails on their Things Falling Apart album (2000) and Afrika Bambaataa (with Numan himself) on Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light (2004).

Gary Numan (born Gary Anthony James Webb on 8 March 1958) is an English singer, composer, and musician, most widely known for his chart-topping 1979 hits "Are 'Friends' Electric?" (as Tubeway Army) and "Cars". His signature sound consisted of heavy synthesiser hooks fed through guitar effects pedals.

Numan is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music. His use of themes from science fiction, and his combination of aggressive punk energy with electronics, have been widely imitated.
