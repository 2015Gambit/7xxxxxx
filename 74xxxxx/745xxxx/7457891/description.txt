Review by Scott Yanow:
This CD reissues one of Carmen McRae's best recordings of the 1960s. McRae always considered Billie Holiday to be her primary influence, so a tribute album was a natural project for her. Joined by her regular trio (pianist Norman Simmons, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Walter Perkins) and three guests (cornetist Nat Adderley, tenor man Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, and guitarist Mundell Lowe), the singer interprets a dozen songs associated with Lady Day. Although Holiday's influence can be felt, McRae already had her own distinctive voice and phrasing, resulting in fresh versions of such songs as "Them There Eyes," "Miss Brown to You," "I Cried for You," and even "God Bless the Child." A coolly emotional version of "Strange Fruit" (in which she is accompanied just by Lowe's guitar) is a highlight. In addition, two songs not originally included on the LP ("If the Moon Turns Green" and the slightly out of place but still satisfying "The Christmas Song") were added to the reissue. Recommended.
