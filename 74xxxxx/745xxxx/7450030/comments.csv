Movie looks good, SLJ is excellent when he chooses good roles. I think he ends up sucking when we chases the money....crappy productions that throw all of their money into getting SLJ. Remember an actor is only as good as the director that is directing him. Brad pit sucked in the tree of life, but that does not make him a bad actor. it's the production."
