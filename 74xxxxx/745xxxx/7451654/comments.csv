,Keshie,2012-07-28T14:28Z,"Archive unpacks fine. Use 7-Zip.

But where's the serial to activate this??"
,Vampluva,2012-07-30T02:20Z,"Unpacks without a hitch, though with so few Seeders it's a slow slow download.
And without the unlocking key, I'm thinking it would have been faster to just download it from the official site...
Was the key meant to be in the zip file, because if so I couldn't see it."
,G.Dubya,2012-07-30T09:03Z,Same here!  Where is the serial to activate?
