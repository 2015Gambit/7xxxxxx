 Profile of the Jamaican athlete, who will be hoping his performance at London 
 2012 will see him become the first man ever to retain the 100m, 200m and 4x100m 
 relay Olympic titles. The documentary follows Bolt over the past 12 months as 
 he prepares for the most important races of his life, and features some of the 
 people who have helped him sprint to the top of his profession, including 
 friends, relatives and Jamaican national coach Maurice Wilson.
                                
                                 Enjoy!
