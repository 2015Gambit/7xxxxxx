A Gnome's Home: The Great Crystal Crusade, så skulle jag bli överlycklig. Tack på förhand."
,kattis1971,2012-07-19T16:55Z,"Can somebode put the pc-game 
A Gnome's Home: The Great Crystal Crusade, out for downloading? Please, it would be so kind."
,Dvad-out,2012-07-23T21:02Z,"I was playing this game just fine.  Had the .rar version and today I tried to play it and it kept taking me to a website.  That website gave my computer a virus.  I couldn't open this game so I tried the .exe version where I had to extract the game.  That, too, took me to the same website.  What the stink is going on?"
,wyldchyld2,2012-08-12T18:11Z,"Thanks for the game. 
It plays flawlessly."
,babycakers,2012-08-17T10:48Z,My computer detected a virus and removed it right away.
,michfe2403,2012-08-17T15:38Z,That's true. There is a virus. If you don't have one doesn't mean it became clean as by magic. It means your AV-programme is shit and you're having now a nice trojan horse. Have fun with it.
