Other Worlds - Ayahuasca documentary


Ayahuasca, the holy sacrament which the indigenous people and Shamans of the Amazon have known as a powerful holistic purgative medicine capable of great healing and transformation for thousands of years. The film 'Other Worlds : A Journey Into The Heart Of Shipibo Shamanism' by Jan Kounen primarily shows the therapeutic power of the Shamans and their plant teachers. This power is a type of ancestral psychoanalysis or human psychotherapy backed by 4,000 years of experience and practice. 

Ayahuasca is a powerful purgative and curative mixture which is used by the shamans of the Amazon to commune with the spirits, who then oversee the healing of the person who drinks the Ayahuasca brew, while the shaman guides the healing session and appeals to the spirits on behalf of his client.
