,deralbo1,2012-07-28T00:34Z,"very decent copy! Thanks Cinefile for riping it and thank you DownTYU for uploading it here :)!

I think all christians should watch this movie and see the true values of Islam and Prophet Muhammad PBUH!

Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
