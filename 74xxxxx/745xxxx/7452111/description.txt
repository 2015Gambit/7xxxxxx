 The biggest sporting event for the school town   
 of Nainital is the annual cycling race.          
 Schools and colleges here range from those       
 like Rajput and Xavier's for the spoilt rich kids
 to local ones like Model for the poorer kids.    
 For the past two years the cycling race has been 
 won by the arrogant Shekhar Malhotra of Rajput   
 College. Sanju and Ratan are bothers who attend  
 Model and run a small local cafe. Their father   
 is obsessed by the desire to see Ratan become    
 the cycling champion. Ratan on his part is the   
 ideal son and elder brother to Sanju, good       
 in everything he does and has been the runner-up 
 to Shekhar in the cycling race. Sunju on the     
 other hand is a prankster, not taking life       
 seriously at all enjoying life with his friends  
 among whom is Anjali who loves him silently.....
