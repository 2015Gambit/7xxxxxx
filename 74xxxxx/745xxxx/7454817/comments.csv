(Japanese n Chinese)

You will save 1 gb space on hdd in installed  os 
and 300 mb on iso
as Chinese (traditional and simplified) + Japanese 
languages requires 1 gb space .

please seed after download 

thanks"

u can use this
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7418713/windows_7_ultimate_sp1_x32_lite_with_Internet_Explorer_9

as per  ur requested components it contains IE9 as extra ,if u really don't want IE9 
extract iso with winrar and remove it with vlite and rebuild iso.

tweaks u can revert back ,BTW if enable tweaks and then disable some which u  like , u will surely learn more

if u want simple way u can download
RT Registry Tweaker.exe file from rt7 website or its in my torrent

,yet1016,2012-07-22T14:04Z,"tnx for your explanation, i'll try this
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7418713/windows_7_ultimate_sp1_x32_lite_with_Internet_Explorer_9. 

windows firewall is it included in that version? any tutorial on how to remove files w/ vllite and how to rebuild ISO? i'm a newbie"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-22T15:40Z,"@yet1016
i think firewall is not there, if present u will have hard time to enable it,
but firewall is present in wmc version but it contain 
wmc n wmp

just extract iso with winrar,open that extracted iso in vlite,select  removal and rebuilding, vlite will take care of it"
,yet1016,2012-07-22T16:20Z,"firewall present in this one?
