,Dimmis80,2012-07-17T19:03Z,"Hey my friend scene.Not a complain ofcorse and u know me i am a huge fun and a follower and your Raw-Smackdown/Events rules but with this version i don't have any sound.!All my other stuff,games,vids,music are all just fine so its not my sound card.!!Just to let u know dude if u did not realise it or check it.From the other hand now i noticed the 277 seeders and just 2 comments about the sound.Do u think that is a problem with the BS.Player i use and not a problem of your vid mate.For the first time after so long i have a problem.Any confirmation of u if the problem is from the vid or mine software problem.?"
,Gelith,2012-07-17T19:58Z,"Got sound. But full of adverts, so if possible download another one guys. Missed the RUDOS one this monday, but anyways. Good work Scene. No complains to you as you upload these every week!"

,YFNShyne-Box,2012-07-18T04:14Z,Got sound.  VLC player.
,Dimmis80,2012-07-18T13:16Z,"Ok my friend scene4all thanks for the instraction but btw i used your other version ""EvilCrew""and i am cool with all so ok.Cheers.;-)"
,YFNShyne-Box,2012-07-18T15:24Z,"Got commercials too!!
Should have gone with EViLCREW's version and avoided 100's of MB of wasted band, but I'm unlimited so next time I'll know better!  I'm guessing that with RAW at 3 hours now, the file should be about the size of this one without the commercials.  Looking forward to RAW 1000, Thanks again, scene4all, for all your uploads!!"
