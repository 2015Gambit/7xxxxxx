You use the ""words"" unzipp, and funnn. You use the tags ""nitendo"" and ""sznez"".

All this considered I think this is malware at best."

Get this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6976208/FGC__Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_ROMs_-_No-Intro_2012-01
And a newer emulator like a new version os snes9x or bsnes. Dont use zsnes as most games don't work properly or don't work at all."
