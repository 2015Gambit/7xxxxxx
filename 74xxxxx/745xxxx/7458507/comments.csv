,Citzen92,2012-07-25T13:52Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. says ""Ubisoft game launcher error. Reinstalling the game may fix problem"" - I've reinstalled about 5 times and still nothing. Trash rip."
,Citzen92,2012-07-25T15:03Z,"Actually it works, you need to download Ubisoft Game Launcher, install it before game; it worked for me. "

No one ever thinks that 'they' did something wrong -_- It's pretty sad."
