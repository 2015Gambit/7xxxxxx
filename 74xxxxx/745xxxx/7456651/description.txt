2CD Set featuring Blizzard of Ozz / Diary of a Madman and 1987's Tribute (as a 2 part set). These are the original mixes (not sure if they're the 95 remasters or not). Also includes (as far as I know this is the ONLY CD pressing) "You Looking at Me (Looking at You)" (In it's original form from the Crazy Train single). Log files / spectral images and full scans are also included. I don't know much about this release, it is a US pressing. The liner notes include the full LP replicas complete with pictures and lyrics (minus the Tribute info. and No Bone Movies lyrics). Not my rip, I don't have any other info. on it, sorry. I saw this and had to share it.
