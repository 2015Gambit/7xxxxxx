[V],psspss,2012-07-25T06:23Z,"the quality is only as good as the source the 720p
mkv are equally bad audio and video

and no Im not sharing 720p.. its a waste of data

count yourself lucky someone like me wastes my time and bandwidth to make smaller xvids
or even add it to p2p community in the first place"
