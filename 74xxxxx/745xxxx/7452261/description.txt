Julius Magan - The worship sesions  Vol 3 

Is an evangelist at heart and music and worship is a major part
of the message that he brings, and at times is the message.
JuliusΓÇÖ heart is not merely to sing a song, perform or to entertain.
His driving force is to see people truly meet with their Saviour 
and come to know Jesus Christ in a more personal and intimate way.
He was convinced that the songs God was giving him during worship
were not just simply songs but keys that would open doors into a 
deeper and more intimate relationship with the Lord through His Holy Spirit.
