P.S. Apologies for the newbie question. "

,RameoRufio,2012-08-22T03:18Z,"This was reported after Norton scan:

2012-08-22 12:13:56,High,Suspicious.MH690.A detected by Virus scanner,Quarantined,Resolved - No Action Required

After scan I extracted setup file. 1, Ran setup and installed Trial. 2, Copied Keygen folder to Smartdraw folder in program files (x86). 3, Ran Keygen from this folder (Install folder) 4, Selected Team Rept as licence name, added to list and selected generate.

Done and working fine.

Not sure about the sus file but Norton fixed it and all go now.

Hope this helps!

,adigem00,2012-08-22T09:56Z,In WinXP it again asks for Smartdraw directory and after routing it to directory it is working for me as well. Thanks RameoRufio.
,Idae183,2012-09-10T09:25Z,"It wasn't working at first when I already had SmartDraw installed. So I uninstalled it and tried again.

*Uninstalled.
*Installed from the setup found in the torrent.
*Program(x86)->SmartDraw 2012.
*Copy everything in ""SmartDraw 2012 Keygen - REPT"" into folder ""SmartDraw 2012"". (I think you only need to copy ""file_id.diz"" and the keygen. 
*I watched the REPT text scroll through (skippable?).
*Opened Keygen in the ""SmartDraw 2012"" folder.

And then it worked..."
