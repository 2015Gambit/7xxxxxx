SmartDraw is the World's First Visual Processor TM - Just as the word processor makes it possible for anyone to create beautifully formatted written documentation, the visual processor makes it possible for anyone to create presentation-quality visuals just as easily.Before the visual processor, visuals had to be created manually with complex graphics software. Even for experts, producing a visual like a flowchart was time consuming and the results were often not presentation-quality. SmartDraw automates the creation of visuals to such a degree that anyone can do it, and get great results in minutes.

Why Everyone Needs a Visual Processor
The rapid pace of change in the modern business world and the information overload it has caused is a problem we all wrestle with. We need to consume information in a way that can be easily understood in the minimum amount of the time. When you look at information presented visually, you can immediately see the key ideas and the relationships between them, instead of having to take the time to read a 12 page report. A picture really is worth a 1,000 words.
