This episode kicks off the 10th season of this educational show (also
celebrating the milestone of one hundred episodes,) with a tribute to
Rock n' Roll that covers such subjects that are off the beaten path
like Bob Dylan's very first *electric* guitar, Alleged autographs from
The Beatles, and some "hippie" album art that seems to be attributed 
to the Great Mother of invention, none other than Frank Zappa. I found
this one of the most interesting episodes of this program since it's
beginning, but then I am a true R&R fan...
