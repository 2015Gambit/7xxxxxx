But Hitler has a secret weapon up his sleeve – a spaceship fleet to strike back and smash the invasion of the Untermenschen! Five American GIs are stationed in the Australian outback on a top-secret mission, with only their wits and a time machine standing between them and Earth’s domination under the jackboot. Can they thwart the evil Nazi plans to crush humanity and rule both space and time? Five Men. Twenty-five dimensions. One reality!
