Note: First off thanks to a good m8..Messed about with the normal filters etc. The res is much better then the last release. It has a lil flicker but its more than watchable. Also from now and again the left bottom corner has a head that pops up for a sec every so often but you dont lose anything. Btw the audio is cam and its fully in sync also and its pretty good even for cam audio besides the laughin now and again. Enjoy smile.gif A sample has been included to test for quality and compatibility and don't fall for fake
