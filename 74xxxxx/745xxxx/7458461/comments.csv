[T],johnpc666,2012-07-20T01:42Z,"this is a 480p file, they don't come as avi's.

download the hdtv version instead, :)"
,CosmAvngr,2012-07-20T14:51Z,".AVIs are the past.

You don't need VLC to play .mkv.  I prefer MPC-HC myself, but on Windows 7, you just need to add haali media splitter, and Windows Media Player will work, if you insist on that. "
,CosmAvngr,2012-07-20T14:57Z,"Also if you want the big size of AVI files.

Do a search and add xvid to it. That will get you those big fat AVIs.

Thanks Johnpc666 for the nice small x264 files. "
[T],johnpc666,2012-07-20T15:04Z,"True, these small file sizes rule. I have 2TB's but i still prefer these files (especially mSD) over the larger AVI's.

And I personally use KMPlayer for video.
But you can always add the CCCP pack to media player if you perfer. :) "
