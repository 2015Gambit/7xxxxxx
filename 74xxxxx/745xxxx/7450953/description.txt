Summary
In a rugby match, disaster strikes as player Kazuki causes serious injury to his friend Takeshi, and as a result he is left as a vegetable. Guilt-ridden he quits the team and settles in a remote Kamakura GirlΓÇÖs High School as a sport teacher. During a hot summer holiday, Kazuki has fallen into a love relationship, albeit unacceptable to the outsiders, with one of his student Mayu. Later, he realizes that his attraction to her comes from nothing other than her loneliness and a crime labelled as grossly unforgivable.
