,radische,2012-07-26T03:10Z,Seems to work. No requests for activation (yet).
,hstpb,2012-07-28T06:54Z,"This SON OF A B*ITCH has put a password, he's a f*ucking spammer! Don't download this s*hit! 

And you, mother f*ucker, put this torrent in the a*sshole of your f*ucking mother and sisters, and ask them to suck our balls after it, please ;-)

Could you proceed this way?"
,hstpb,2012-07-28T07:02Z,"I have downloaded other 3 torrents from this shit eater, all password protected with spam links. If you really didn't do it, please:
REALLY EXCUSE ME!

All the torrents for Streets and Trips were with your name. That's bad, quite bad for you."
,StanCanada,2012-07-29T16:06Z,"Thanks for the upload!!

I just installed it on Win 7 without a hitch; and it works great!! "
,Sunseeker908,2012-08-01T04:04Z,"hstpb is a flipping idiot.  It's an ISO and it installs fine.  There's no password.

,tall70,2012-08-01T21:06Z,"Its OK, but just OK. I just need simple quick street address finder and it's nowhere near to simplicity of google maps unfortunately. I have older 2008 version, it's 4 years later and graphically and use wise it did not evolve a bit. If u just grab and move map with mouse it's still flickering street names, search still has to be typed with specific code with commas, sure it's not big of deal, but i would expect MS do better. Especially if this is program, not just browser adaptation. Give it video driver and make simple easy to type search and advanced search separate. Well If i don't want to pay for unlimited mobile internet connection, this is what i'm gonna have to use. I guess better then nothing."
,major_dude,2012-08-12T22:07Z,"Who's hstpb?  Can't someone moderate his comments.  Once again, perfect download and thanks!"
,de173,2012-08-15T10:33Z,"open ISO file using WinZip or WinRar, unzip or 'unrar' to a new folder on the desktop, then right clicked on SETUP and run as ADMINISTRATOR. After setup completes, goto C:Programs Files (x86)Microsoft Streets & Trips 2013, then right click on Streets.exe and 'send to desktop' (creates a shortcut on the desktop), now just rename the shortcut to Streets & Trips 2013 and ur done, easy as pie. Confirmed is actually Streets & Trips 2013! "
,chika00,2012-08-22T20:31Z,"I get this error when I try to install it

This package could not be opened.  Verify that the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid windows installer package."
,widowzson,2012-09-06T20:22Z,"Works fine
