Complete Arduino suite (avr cross compiling and IDE. Arduino IDE from GIT)
for Linux 2.6 x86_64, that is to say, Java is x86, but binaries are x86_64.

It uses modern binutils, avr-gcc 4.6.2 and avr-libc 1.8.0, and defies the 'p' not 
declared in scope symptom, by using Arduino IDE GIT version, which is started with
Apache's ANT + Java.

All is in this 'suite', almost explains itself.

All runs sort of 'sandboxed' so no interfering with your o.s. if understood 
correctly.

It focusses on Atmel Arduino (not PIC Arduino).


Again:
It defies the 'p' not declared in scope symptom and so fixes incompatibility
between modern avr-gcc and avr-libc, and the (older) standard Arduino 1.0 IDE from
the project site.

So there's more support for Atmel platforms, and also smaller/smarter Sketches.
