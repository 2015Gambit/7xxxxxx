Separate English Subtitles for each episode (If using VLC, tap the letter V to disable them or else delete the .srt files.  The source of the subtitles is: Breaking.Bad.S01.720p.BluRay.x264-REWARD, but I changed their names to match the VisionX names.)

NOTE: There are certainly better rips out there, but if you wish for much smaller filesizes, with slightly lower quality, this is the release for you.  Otherwise, if you want very high quality, but with much larger file sizes, I would recommend:
