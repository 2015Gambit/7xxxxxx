This is the 2001 DVD-Audio remaster of Take 6's first album entitled "Take 6" (also known as "doo wee doo wop bop!") released in 1988. Two bonus tracks from their later albums are also included on this disc, 'I L-O-V-E U' and 'So Cool.' I have used DVD-Audio Explorer to rip the tracks from the DVD-A and FLAC frontend v1.7.1 to losslessly compress the tracks. There are two versions, the 96kHz/24bit 5.1 surround sound and the 96kHz/24bit stereo downmix from the DVD-A ('get stereo downmix' option on DVD-Audio Explorer). Booklet scans included.
