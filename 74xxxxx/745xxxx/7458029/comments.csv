,baybeh,2012-07-21T07:55Z,"Hi tr108, is it possible for you to upload the Lord of the Rings special edition box set stuff with all the extras? Tough call, I know, but trying my luck! Thanks. Love your quality uploads."
,baybeh,2012-07-21T07:59Z,"I meant the extended edition. 
Also, why is there no pink skull next to your name? You're one of the best uploaders this side of the solar system!"

,DannyPhantom,2012-08-03T19:45Z,"TR108,do you can upload series ""Oban star racers""?"
,swingking77,2012-08-06T21:07Z,"Seriously! I just made an account to say thanks! This is by far the greatest copies of this show that I've seen online! Thanks. I would humbley ask that you please consider releasing Super Hero Squad, Iron Man Armored Adventures, and last but not least a proper Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes season release. There simply isn't anyone out there that can touch your stuff as far as animation is concerned. Keep up the great work!"
,swingking77,2012-08-06T21:32Z,WOW! Great upload! Made an account JUST to say thanks!!!
,swingking77,2012-08-06T21:34Z,"Could you please consider making Iron Man Armored Adventures, Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes, and Super Hero Squad season releases. Nobody can touch your animation quality! Thanks again!"
