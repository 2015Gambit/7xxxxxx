ya thanks for ur concern with all Languages.
BTW did u succeed in ""Link Shell Extension"" , I am concerned about it ,i still feel that ..

for ppl who does not require Japanese n Chinese Language and want to save 300mb on  iso
and 1 gb hard disk place.    

same iso without Japanese n Chinese Language

this is for the ppl who want other languages beside ENG except
(Japanese n Chinese)

You will save 1 gb space on hdd in installed os
and 300 mb on iso
as Chinese (traditional and simplified) + Japanese
languages requires 1 gb space .

,extracube,2012-07-21T21:55Z,"Looks like you made good choices to take out those programs.  I mean, I assume Windows Defender is pretty weak anyways, is it not?

Wondering how many GBs space this takes up on a fresh install...  Based on your response above, this saves about a GB?  So about 7.5 then?"

ok i will try to explain u
i uploaded 2 iso  
1. 1st iso contains all languages (this one) its 1 gb iso ( installation size 2.8 gb)
2. 2nd iso (without japnese n Chinese Lang) other iso 800 mb ( installation size 2 gb)

the iso which does not contain japnese p n chinese lag is 200 mb smaller in size 
and when one install it will take 1 gb less space than all lang iso.

full win 7 is way too larger 9-10 gb i think,

one will get windows media center, tablet pc in 800 mb iso  /2 gb hdd space on installation

hope i cleared ur doubt  "

,lebac,2012-07-22T00:09Z,"Do not use this if you value your current windows installation. It is not an update or service pack. It installs completely new version of windows over your old one, deleting any previous register/key/crack option you had.
Luckily I was able to restore old version of win7."
