,Kickasssite4real,2012-07-18T22:27Z,Finally one that doesn't fail the virus scan #happy dance!! A8 V8. Thanks man!
,animalmcburger,2012-07-19T08:24Z,"I watched this in theatres without knowing it was done by Seth McFarlane.  This movie was like watching a live version of family guy.  If you're a fan of the cartoon like I am, you'll love this shit.  It's like he took all the xrated dirty shit he couldn't do on tv and threw it into this movie.  Fucking awesome flick.  Laughed my ass off."
,You_Muppet,2012-07-20T13:42Z,A & V = 7. Thanks S4A and all seeders.
,melbcro,2012-07-21T20:25Z,"Looks more a HD cam then a TS.
Audio sounds not too bad."
,imVv,2012-07-24T13:03Z,"Doesn't look like a CAM at all .. Nice Print .. 
Thanks S4A

,maclured,2012-08-01T01:59Z,"Man these guys are full of it. Relatively good audio with very obvious cam blockage with seats in theatre and the image is blurry as hell.

,andrrz,2012-08-09T21:41Z,"Legitimate rating:
A/V  5/4

Not for a cam or anything. It's definitely wathcable if you wan't the story, and you won't struggle understanding anything. From time to time, it slightly shakes a little bit. and audio makes blurring sounds if played too loud. "
,Kazenako,2012-08-11T20:55Z,"audio- 9
video - 7"
,anderson6655,2012-08-12T01:34Z,"Brilliant torrent 100% genuine

,Shadeux,2012-08-13T09:49Z,"A:8
V:10
M:9 (Personal opinion)

This is an awesome copy for a cam. Definitely watchable. If you like Family Guy, then you will like this movie. If you don't, then this movie isn't for you. "

,vacuoso,2012-08-16T07:07Z,huh
,vacuoso,2012-08-16T07:10Z,"just watched it on a 55"" tv hdmi'd from my laptop and i think the movie-theater-gaussian-blur is the shit, it gives the movie a 'silver screen' quality. V:10. fun as shit to watch.. 
audio: 4--digital clip.
thank you for the upload, i laughed my ass off for free. fuck the haters, it's good... enjoy."
,missworld,2012-08-16T16:31Z,"Vacuoso you are full of shit.. it's hardly watchable on a lap top never mind a 55"" screen

A/V 5/2

And none of this ""for a cam"" Bollox. "
,akyiia,2012-08-19T06:28Z,"This is just another blurry time wasting crap !! I don't really get why the file has 1.4Gb when in fact I have seen much better quality just under 700Mb..
Don't waste your time by downloading this shit !"
,amelitaliz,2012-08-20T07:15Z,"Great quality on my laptop but has Cini-whatever protection on it, won't play on my PS3"

,Demoil,2012-08-28T09:55Z,Great Quality! Thanks!
,LAFRESH,2012-09-01T19:20Z,"works perfect! i don't care about quality as i know it is a bootleg, I am still very appreciative but a tiny portion of the left screen is cut off, that is the only con i can think of about this torrent

also for comedy snobs, this movie is actually pretty fucking funny, consistent laughs too not just sporadic ones throughout like most comedies nowadays, i downloaded this with low expectations for being a comedy, but it actually proved me wrong.. this movie is great! thanks s4a!"
,ZhugeL,2012-09-02T22:38Z,"A 5  V 7

After adjusting audio and video settings: 
A 6 V 8.5

Probably the best cam yet, but sound is not the best, gonna wait for the dvd/br release"

,sinepeguh,2012-09-09T20:25Z,"@bharatirajesh36       Funny, you said the exact same thing in the comments of several other movies, too."
,mathewghost,2012-09-13T02:36Z,sucks
,blkbrt,2012-09-14T07:21Z,"not terrible. bit of screen is cut off but with this movie it's not a deal breaker. definitely watchable. Compared to the greatest b/leg of all time maybe it sucks but for a general run of the mill deal, it's not that bad. "
,tumjum13,2012-09-15T23:03Z,"This film is not for everyone! If you are easily offended then you should read no further and give this one a miss. However, if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane's other projects and maybe you call yourself an ""80's child"" you are going to love this. I saw it on freefree.noahw.org because of better quality and i can recommend this movie to all of you, great one! "
