Note:Ok heres our take on TED....to go with the other 100 copies Wasn't going
too bother but when handed the 720p file,it would be rude not to!!
Video we cut into 3 and rotated and pulled the sides differently on each part
...needed a res that look good for all of it so the AR might change slightly
during these 3 parts Video we cleaned up changing all the normal stuff 
Audio we had too sync too the video ...more or less went over but needed a few
-200 - +200 shifts here and there
After we cleaned it and remuxed and hey presto .....THE FUNNIEST film this
year !!
