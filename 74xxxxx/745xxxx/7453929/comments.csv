is no where to be found :(

also if people are interested i added a torrent for a proper dvd rip for season 1 from nodlabs..
It took me a couple days to find sources for them too !
Very hard to find online !"
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-25T13:27Z,"it's not about stealing sources it's about butchering them. i grew up being told if you're gonna do something do it right. changing fps screws up the duration. doing single pass encodes loses quality. i've been trying to advise this for a long time, friendly at first, but nasty as you would knit pick the heck out of my stuff. 

and yea i did leave for a while because i told psspss if he commented one more time i would leave - he became that annoying griping and whining about every x264 release i had. i mean the tiniest little thing and he'd jump all over it. talk about obnoxious. but hey they're all good now, huh? no problems with sync or audio pops now, huh? they convert just fine without troubles now, huh? ;D

you don't have to put tNeSrc in the title. the mentioning of where you got it from in the description was plenty. in fact that's more than what some do.

i aint hatin ya but you did annoy the hell out of me.  that's in the past.  hatchet is buried and am back to doin my thing - uploading."
