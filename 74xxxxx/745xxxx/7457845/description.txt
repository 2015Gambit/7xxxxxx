Here is a fix I made for the Rev E patch (credits to The Blade) of The Sims 2.
(I'm on Snow Leopard and the patch won't load. It can surely help too if you had some errors with the patch.)

Instructions:

1. Install the Sims 2
2. Download and install the Sims 2 Rev. E update patch from http://www.gamershell.com/download_14153.shtml
3. Patch with the Rev. E crack fixed (the file from this torrent)

Hope it will works for everyone.
