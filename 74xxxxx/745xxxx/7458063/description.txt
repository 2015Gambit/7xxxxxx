Classic Rock focuses on the biggest names in rock music past, present and future with in-depth features, exclusive interviews, a substantial reviews section, and music news. lassic Rock is a GREAT magazine. No emo. No nu metal. No punk (well, not much). So what does it have you ask? How about classic '70s and '80s ROCK AND ROLL, NWOBHM, Prog and Indie. Yeah, every once in awhile an issue will have too much Led Zep or too much AC/DC which to me is a waste for this fine magazine because you can read about those bands anywhere. But, what makes Classic Rock magazine so unique is that it covers many (of my favorite) bands that you do not see on the covers of 20 other magazines sitting nexxt to it on the shelf. Bands that may or may not have "made it" in their day but nonetheless inspired newcomers and/or their slice of history such as Hawkwind, King Crimson, Motorhead, Thin Lizzy, Soft Machine, Robert Wyatt, Gong, T. Rex, Peter Hammill, VdGG, and of course the metal trinity of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and the almighty Black Sabbath. Classic Rock has a great way of providing unique coverage (rare photos & excellent interviews) and have a great way of mixing the old with the new. Their facts are accurate and what gives them an edge of credibility over so many other rags is they seem to CARE and KNOW and REVERE these bands like you and I do. What a concept - writers who actually know about the bands they interview and write about.
