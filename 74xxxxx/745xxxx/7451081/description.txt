Domino is preparing the release on 28th May of

I Learned from the Gaels, the first in a series of EPs by folk troubadour King Creosote.



The four tracks included are inspired by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace signed by King James IV of Scotland and King Henry VII of England 509 years ago. An episode of peace which, by the way, only lasted ten years in the end. According to Creosote, this time he is ΓÇ£backed by a posse of superhot minstrels that spans a BBC songbird, a northern star and a bygone Iron Maiden moonlighter.ΓÇ¥



The songs were written in the Scottish region of East Neuk in the spring of 2010, except ΓÇ£Little ManΓÇ¥, which is a new version of the track by Gummi Bako.
