STORYLINE
**********

Tom and Anne wake up in their shared room in the hospital, where they've been hunkered down for two weeks. They enjoy how almost normal it seems. Tom remembers the old days, including the smell of coffee brewing and his boys fighting and his wife breaking them up. He apologizes for bringing up his wife, but Anne understands -- she had a husband, too. This is the life they have now and they're enjoying it.
