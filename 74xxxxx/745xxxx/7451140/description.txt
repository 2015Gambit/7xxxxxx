Upload Notes:
This was already uploaded in 2010 but even though the torrent
reports 2 seeders I was unable to start the download at all.
Also i noticed a big difference in file size between the
old torrent and the .exe downloaded from lifeglobe.com yesterday
which makes me think this upload is a different build anyway.

Install notes:
Run setup and enter key in the register tab in the config screen.
enjoy.
