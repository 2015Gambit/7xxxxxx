The Best of Later with Jools Holland is yet one more cult classic music video show produced and paid for by the British Public, for the BBC is a public must subscribe public broadcaster.

I suspect that Jools and a lot of the other 'lovelies' in the music section of the BBC have long forgotten that.   However the winds of change have blown on Jools and every one at the BBC and hopefully the show will reflect more popular tastes and less - what I want to show you in the near future.

The SAD fact is that some people like the music which Jools (and myself) do NOT!

To be fair to Jools and all at the BBC this is a very difficult time in what I consider one of the Worlds BEST BROADCASTER's History and on reflection I am sure I will judge this as 'harsh' in the weeks to come, for as we all know once you post on the Pirate Bay you can NOT come back and edit the torrent or this text!

With music now being 'discovered' for free on the internet on sites just like this, I fear for the future of even a show as well produced and presented as this, for as Bob Dylan once sang..  "The Times They Are A Changing" and trendy, with the in crowd, people like Jools may have to go out and start gigging again.

Still I guess he will have over half a million pounds of the UK public's TV Licence fee in his back pocket, so what is not to like?

Eh... Perhaps the way music is going these days????
