,topk,2012-07-21T19:10Z,Audio is NOT ENGLISH so forget this
,fakez0r,2012-07-22T00:03Z,topk: What language did you expect from a spanish movie? If your not illiterate then you can read the english subtitles that are included.
,electropop_guy,2012-07-22T15:55Z,"topk: You mean when it says ""Spoken language: Spanish"" it's not in English? Whod' have thought it?"
,dannygi,2012-07-23T02:28Z,"Guess what... Not only US does movies!!! AMAZING ÂŹÂŹ

This is an Spanish Movie, great movie by the way, if you want to see it use subtitles or you can wait for the US Remake (QUARANTINE)."
,heL1x,2012-07-23T11:38Z,"English subs right here, save the file that you downloaded on the link below.  Open VLC player with this movie, right click, select video and subtitles, open this file you downloaded.  It should work fine.

On another note are there actually subtitles on this download? I don't see any .srt files included so I'm assuming no unless they are hard subs on the print."
,klark.kent,2012-07-24T00:22Z,Not work dis Film!!
,aa1234779,2012-07-28T04:03Z,"the file format for the film is mkv. the subs are inside the same file as the video. 

nuff said"
,AlphaTPB2001,2012-07-30T01:50Z,"The audio and video quality is awesome. There are some distortions in sound and video at certain moments, but that's part of the film, so don't freak out.

Still, the story sucks hard. You'll be disappointed if you were waiting something more like the first two Rec's."
