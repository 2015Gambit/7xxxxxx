,Xepher227,2012-07-19T04:18Z,Rate the quality too guys  on the top right of the page    Nice job ettv! thx will be seeding
,Kyle2011anon,2012-07-19T05:52Z,"Also, A/V 10/9. Episode quality is like 15/10 one of my favorites this season. Seconded only by episode 2 which was like 17/10 for me. Definitely looks better on my PS3 or Computer then it would on my cable.

Excellent quality and 100% working on PS3 for those who may watch on their PS3 like I do.

One quick warning: Towards the end of the episode when they preview next weeks episode the volume gets kinda loud. Don't know if it's a screw up on my end or what cause my uTorrent glitched out on me lol.

Anyway, Excellent and I will seed until next Tuesday :)"
