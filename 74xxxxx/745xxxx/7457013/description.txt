Introduction

The Chinese movie Jiawu Fengyun, directed by Lin Nong, produced by Changchun Film Studios and launched in 1962, is one of the most successful historical movies in China. It is known as the official film on the First Sino-Japanese War (in Chinese called Zhongri Jiawu Zhanzheng, August 1894 to April 1895 ΓÇô a war fought between Qing dynasty China and Meiji Japan, initially over the control of Korea). The movie is based on historical personalities and events related to this war in its early phase and is still officially recommended for use in school.

In 1894, the Qing dynasty was in grave trouble, because Japan was about to provoke war with China in order to settle the question of supremacy in Korea. Within the Qing court, some officials (in general portrayed as corrupt) downplayed the danger of a Japanese attack. These officials were headed by Li Hongzhang who advocated a policy of non-resistance. Even as the Japanese started attacking the Chinese, Li Hongzhang insisted on his policy of appeasement. On the other hand, there were other patriotic officials and military commanders, like Deng Shichang, who wanted to fight Japan to death. Deng commanded the battleship Zhiyuan which was involved in the first major sea battle against the Japanese, targeting the Japanese most prestigious battleship Yoshino, but unfortunately Deng Shichang and his crew ran out of ammunition. The Zhiyuan, without being able to defend herself any more, drove full speed and tried to ram the Yoshino. Being hit by a Japanese torpedo, she sank before achieving her aim, though. Deng Shichang with his crew thus died a martyrΓÇÖs death.
