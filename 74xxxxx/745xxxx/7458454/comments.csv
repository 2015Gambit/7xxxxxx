,notime4BS,2012-07-19T21:56Z,"This is the third upload of this in less than an hour, and all three of them feature a sample that is a trailer for ""The Dark Knight Rises"", followed by a trailer for ""American Reunion"". TvTeam and tykoon123 were the other uploaders; tykoon123 included screenshots in theirs, but with the sample being what it is, I'm afraid to download the actual movie, considering the problems .BONE. has been having uploading a working copy of ""Magic Mike"". Be very wary, because something is not right here. "

,TARZ3N,2012-07-20T01:12Z,"NOTIME4BS - YOUR COMMENT IS SHIT!!!! .BONE. has answered the call of duty above and beyond your miserable efforts. .BONE. Keep doing what your doing-your upload rate is excellent, defender of the free world you are. NOTIME4BS if you want a MAGIC MIKE BONER there's some little blue pills out there. I have spoken now shut the fuck up! Thanks again .BONE.!!!"
