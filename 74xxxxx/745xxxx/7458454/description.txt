Note: First off thanks to a good m8..Messed about with the normal filters etc. The res is much better then the last release. It turned black and white three times in the movie also. The previews were left in to have the full cinema experience. Btw the audio is cam and in sync and dam good except for a slight chuckle bout three times in the flick.
