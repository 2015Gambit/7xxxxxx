One of the greatest rock films of all time, Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs & Englishmen gets digitally overhauled and released on DVD for the very first time! This film captures one of the most exciting concert tours ever and catapulted Cocker into rock legend.  Recorded at Fillmore East during the first week on the road, with a couple of added tracks from a later show at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, it captures all the excitement and exhilaration of the tour.
