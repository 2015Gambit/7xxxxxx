On August 4th 2011 the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kenya, Raila Odinga, announced, through the local Kenyan media, that he had suspended Miguna Miguna indefinitely without pay as his senior adviser. In his explosive new memoirs, Peeling Back the Mask, Miguna Miguna explains why he rejected the Prime Minister's subsequent offer of reinstatement and exposes Mr Odinga's lack-lustre leadership questioning his progressive credentials and claim that he is an agent of change. Peeling Back the Mask presents a true insider's account of the intrigues, discussions and power plays that have occurred in Kenya's corridors of power in recent years. This is a must read for everyone interested in social justice and good governance in Africa. Peeling Back the Mask also delves back to tell the remarkable tale of Miguna's early life, from humble origins, through privations and hardship, his university days and his years as a practicing lawyer overseas. A heartwarmingly personal African story
