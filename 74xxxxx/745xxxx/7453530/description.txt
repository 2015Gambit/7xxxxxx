What's New in Version 2.6.1

What's New
Version 2.6.1:

OS X 10.8: Added a Share toolbar item and Items submenu for using the built-in sharing services in OS X 10.8.
OS X 10.8: Together will now use OS X 10.8's Notification Center instead of Growl when posting notifications.
Fixed a problem that could occur with text documents that cannot be displayed. Now a message is shown in place of the preview.
Fixed a blurriness that can occur when dragging tabs on 10.7 and later.


REQS: Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or later.
