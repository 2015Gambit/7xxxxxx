The Bribe

Now that Steve owns the bar he needs to set
boundaries with his parents. When the health
inspector shows up Ok Cha (series regular Jodi
Long) wants to pay him off, but Steve refuses
and the bar is shut down for the first time
ever. Without the bar, everyone seems lost
except for Owen (series star Owen Benjamin) who
discovers surprisingly productive ways to spend
his time.
