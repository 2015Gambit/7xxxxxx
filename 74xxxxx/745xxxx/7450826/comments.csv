The entire movie will play completely through to the end and is very watchable...sort of a new concept even though predictable. The acting was par with Julia as the standout. Hard coded english subs very readable. Someone needs to seed to 100% though. I would give:
V=9
A=9
M=6-7
Thanks for the upload."
