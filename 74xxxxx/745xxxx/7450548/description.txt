Mad, Mad World is a brand new comedy panel hosted by the fantastic Paddy McGuiness, with each team being comprised of a comic and two celebrities.

Rufus Hound (Celebrity Juice) and Rhys Darby (The Flight of the Conchords) are the team captains, and it will be their job to wade through a series of TV clips from around the world.

There will be banter, satire and clever wit as the teams try to make sense of the hilarious clips from around the world, including sections such as ΓÇÿwhat happens nextΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿguess the hidden talentΓÇÖ.  

Mad, Mad World looks set to be a comical and entertaining addition to ITV1, combining established comedians and our favourite celebrities as they all battle it out in a race to the top of the score board.
