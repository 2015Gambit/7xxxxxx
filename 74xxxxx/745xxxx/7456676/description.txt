This is a crack folder for any Adobe CS6 app on mac. How it works is that you download a TRIAL of any CS6 app from adobe's website. Install AIR if you havent already, it will tell you to do so when you first click download now on the app.

Once done, (this is after you have installed AIR) go back to the trial app you want on the Adobe page, click download now again. It should then open and ask for your Adobe ID (you need to create one before downloading trial)

Once you have done that, you then download and add to your desktop the DMG file that comes after downloading. Once it extracts the DMG itself into the Adobe CD, install on your computer.

NOW - open up the ZIP file that has the crack inside. 

What you do is this:
1. Unzip crack folder.
2. Scroll to Applications > Adobe app (eg. Photoshop CS6) there should be a folder. Open that folder.
3. Then on the App (eg. Photoshop CS6) right click on it and click show package contents.
4. Then click contents > Frameworks.
5. Now inside the crack folder there should be a folder called amtlib.framework something like that.
6. Copy that folder into the frameworks folder inside the CS6 app.
7. A message should come up DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE, KEEP OR CANCEL. Click Replace.
8. Adobe CS6 app should be the full and not the trial. Enjoy. I actually didnt make the crack myself. Found it off an youtube video. Any troubles i can post the youtube link. Thanks. Please seed and good luck!
