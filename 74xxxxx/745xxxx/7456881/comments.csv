,KKKDownlow,2012-07-20T02:28Z,This movie is just as stupid and unwatchable as the Vampire Hunter movie except it has Zombies.
,Gate2MasterChief,2012-07-20T03:39Z,it is unacceptable that yify is getting +2 while -8

Be grateful you cunt, if you don't like don't bother, simple "
,obvious2me,2012-07-23T20:33Z,"As always from YIFY, great quality in a small package.

This movie however, is retarded.

Lojac55, thanks for the laugh.

In the future if you don't have the competence to read then don't bother commenting."
,stray_bullets13,2012-07-24T12:59Z,Haha funny movie :) not bad for a low budget. The beards look pretty fake but the cutting off of heads makes up for it. A/8 (think that is just the low budget audio tech used on set though) V/10 
,lievenazerty,2012-07-26T00:36Z,Great movie... I'm high hahahahahahaha lol sorry 
,h_skelter9,2012-07-26T02:42Z,crap movie & yet soo many leechers...wtf!!!!
,slayerh4x,2012-07-26T20:41Z,"I think this lojac55 idiot didn't read the info and thought it was the Lincoln Vampire movie. That's your own fault moron, not the uploaders."
,rlnplehshalo,2012-07-28T03:14Z,"A: 10
V: 10

Pretty poorly done movie, low budget and not the best acting or story line either."
,alumman,2012-07-31T13:10Z,Finaly a real 720p(1280x720) instead of 1280x540 which many uploader say thats 720p
,saachi,2012-08-02T05:05Z,"This one was made by The Asylum people, it's a fake ass ""mockbuster""."
,moca5,2012-08-03T07:53Z,great quality but the movie was shit
,Arxithia,2012-08-03T08:51Z,suck me off!!!! thank you for the download in my mouth..
,Ibwiseguy,2012-08-07T02:38Z,"I knew this was a ""mockbuster"" but the apple flash player format sucked...controls would not respond properly"

,fakeidmuhammad,2012-08-29T07:58Z,"@ Niccodemuz

The Asylum är ett amerikanskt filmföretag som mest är känt för att de har producerar filmer med liknande titlar som de senaste storfilmerna. Men inte Pippi Långstrump.

The Asylum is an American film company best known for having produced movies with titles similar to the latest blockbusters. But not Pippi Longstocking."
