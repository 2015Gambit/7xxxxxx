New to doing torrents, this is my first actually so I wanted to try a quick one.

This is a collection of Star Trek sounds I have collected over the years, TOS and TNG.

Most are short and were designed for use in system events for windows and other apps. Yes I am a geek :)

If your a Star Trek fan and these are useful to you, please enjoy.

Please rate if you like the collection
