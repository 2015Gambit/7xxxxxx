Now if only the Sox could get it going, but I'm afraid they have too much bad karma~~~It's like the curse has taken hold again~~~and it seems to be reaching out to the other teams in town too~~~Celtics~loosing Ray to a Rival, for less $$ too?  Even the Pats not paying Wes Welker just stinks.  Bad Sports vibes for Beantown right now~~~We really need a shot in the arm.  It's like coming down from H and having withdrawals that won't quit!  Best!  :)"
