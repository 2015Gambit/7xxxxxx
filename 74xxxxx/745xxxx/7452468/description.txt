Outrageously funny, Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar . . . has been a breakout bestseller ever since authorsΓÇöand born vaudevilliansΓÇöThomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein did their schtick on NPRΓÇÖs Weekend Edition. Lively, original, and powerfully informative, Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar . . . is a not-so-reverent crash course through the great philosophical thinkers and traditions, from Existentialism (What do Hegel and Bette Midler have in common?) to Logic (Sherlock Holmes never deduced anything). Philosophy 101 for those who like to take the heavy stuff lightly, this is a joy to readΓÇöand finally, it all makes sense!
