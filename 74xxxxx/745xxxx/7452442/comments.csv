,fknrage,2012-07-19T02:56Z,"No problem. That Interbridge site where you got the info did have it wrong, but it's still great and I always use it to find out who's gonna be on the show. Sometimes they'll edit the listing at the last minute."
,Jero2000,2012-07-19T09:54Z,"The only difference between Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is:

Caine's best imitator is Craig Ferguson. Freeman's best imitator is Ferguson's sidekick Geoff Peterson."
,trentonresident,2012-07-21T15:22Z,Letterman (and Conan) torrents are hard to find lately.
,fknrage,2012-07-21T22:15Z,"Any chance you can post the rest of this week's shows? Usually you post all three on Friday, but no luck this time around. Please don't stop your Letterman torrents!"
