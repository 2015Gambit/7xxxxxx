The Remains of the A

After getting a major clue from Garrett, Hanna and
Spencer set out on their separate missions. Hanna
sees a perfect opportunity to catch "A" or to at
least see who is helping Garrett out. But her
perfect plan starts to quickly unravel, leaving
Hanna frustrated and desperate. Spencer tries to
figure out the meaning of the clue and enlists
Jason's help in the search. Meanwhile, Emily gets
another flashback from "that night" which leads her
to a surprising suspect and Aria starts to question
Ezra's sudden influx of cash.
