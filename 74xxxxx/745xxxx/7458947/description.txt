See all your appointments for the week in one neatly organized overview. Week Calendar is all new, better, awesome calendar for your iPhone or iPod touch.

The default iPhone calendar app does not include a week overview and makes it difficult to see all your items for the coming week; Week Calendar fixes this by providing a new calendar overview, in an awesome and stylish overview.

With a better list-, day-, week-, month, year and agenda-overview, Week Calendar is the calendar that takes full advantage of the iPhone with full touch gesture support.

Organize events using drag-'n-drop or copy/paste. Quickly delete events. Color code individual events. Link contacts to events. Set customized alarms or recurrences. A month view with colored dots. Custom week numbers for financial weeks. And much more that makes working with a calendar easier than ever.

With batch editing of events, automatic color assignments, templates, per-event timezones, calendar presets, contacts linking, adding events into multiple calendars, Week Calendar is THE calendar app for business and casual users.
