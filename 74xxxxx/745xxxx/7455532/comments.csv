,SportelloHM,2012-07-19T13:56Z,"A question:
The contents of the mobi floods, do they (in general) match what is available if you pool the epub floods. Sitting here wondering if there's any point in me downloading BOTH the epub and the mobi floods and do a conversion mobi->epub.

And (as always) great uploads. Thanks  a bunch!"

There might a couple of the same book in both but for the most part they are not the same.Just check the list to see you can decide which to download or not"
