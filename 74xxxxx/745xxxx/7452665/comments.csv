,Rush,2012-07-17T23:33Z,"much bigger file size than the other but must be from same rip ( 2 parts second part 15mins.)

maybe give it a try and will post back quality

Thanks, scenebalance for getting a REAL copy up"
,Silencer7,2012-07-18T10:50Z,"I skimmed through this, in about 1 minute...

V: 2  The bottom half of the screen is the backs of seats.  There's no crowd, but horrible top to bottom centering, needs cut bad.  The video framerate is quite noticeably choppy, somewhat blurry, but with some detail.  Subtitles show this is also actually a mirror image of the movie.  After those facts, it IS watchable.  (But I'd wait.)
A: 4  Scratchy at parts, no crowd noise but a noisy recording.  However dialogue is understandable.
M: See first sentence!

TY Uploader!  With processing, this could be decent."
