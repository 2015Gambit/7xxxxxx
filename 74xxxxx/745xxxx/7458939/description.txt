In 1910, Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen was hanged for poisoning and dismembering his wife. However, investigators have now found that the human remains discovered in Crippen's cellar were not those of his wife. Their further DNA work, revealed exclusively in this film, exposes a historic miscarriage of justice and poses uncomfortable questions about the police and prosecutors who claimed to have solved the crime of the century.
