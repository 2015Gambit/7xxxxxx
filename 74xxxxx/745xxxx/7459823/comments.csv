,Blezza,2012-07-20T14:55Z,"First uploading a crap B-movie with low budget like ""Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies"" and now you upload this PIECE OF SHIT movies that got 2.4 score on imdb by 8k users.. I'm honestly starting to lose my respect for you.

PLEASE stop wasting your time uploading SHITTY ass movies and start uploading high rated quality movies instead."
[V],YIFY,2012-07-20T15:27Z,"Feel free to NOT download this.
I am a huge Miley Cyrus fan :) and I wanted to share this movie. Hope thats ok with you Mr Blezza

Smile :)"

Thumbs up with great respect to what you just said sir...
BEST way to reply a dumb ass who doesnt give a damn about others but himself

,makuna_hatata,2012-07-20T16:18Z,"@YIFY 
Thumbs up with great respect to what you just said sir
thats how ""Dumb idiots who gives no crap about others... "" should be replied.

if this was on 20-40's page... he'd have already replied with so much hatred in crappy language....
thanks for NOT being such :)
1+
RESPECT."
,Midius1992,2012-07-20T16:31Z,"Thanks, man! :-)"
,Midius1992,2012-07-20T16:41Z,Blezza: K...
,Blezza,2012-07-20T16:56Z,"That's ok, i'll never download from you again. Your movies always have audio out of sync anyways. A perfect example is your upload of goon and  Se7en. 

And a miley cyrus fan? Sure she's hot, but not worth watching in a complete crap film. You must be ghey if you like this movie, or a girl. "
,bagong666,2012-07-20T17:11Z,"you are the best, YIFY!"
,GeoTor,2012-07-20T17:52Z,"
LOL Blezza

""i'll never download from you again.""
haha thats one of the funniest things I have ever heard, you make it sounds like you are a paying costumer or something and now because you no longer donwloading (free of charge) from YIFY, she (or he?) will get upset? lol dude get real, no one is paying for stuff being uploaded here. the YIFY Team dont get shit in terms of $$$ when uploading/encoding god knows how many hours a day.

I bet if YIFY Team spent all the time they dedicated for us, working for minimum wage job in a first world country he/she would be pretty well off by now. But no YIFY Team here to give us a free services

Anyways, I'd be pretty confident other feel the same when I say we are all pleased you are not going to be downloading from YIFY, thus resulting I will never have to see your username making comments that smell more than a dead horse's shit.

Peace out fuck face."
,winx86,2012-07-20T18:09Z,"@Blezza : Why don't you fuck yourself other than blaming YIFY !!

@YIFY : Thanks for uploading. I'm her fan too :-)"
,kapool,2012-07-20T18:25Z,LOL @ Blezza's immaturity..... who cares man... a smile is the best answer for a fool YIFY... keep up the good work.... cheers mate... your site is checked and accessed as regularly as facebook.... 
,flipendo,2012-07-20T20:38Z,i agree with bezza ur uploading a lot of shit movies lately

,Knightime,2012-07-20T23:38Z,"I can't stand Miley and this movie looks like complete crap but, you know what, there have been films others hated, I liked and he posted. They put up with my tastes so I can put up with others -- don't like the film; don't download it and STFU.

YIFY may not be around forever, let's be polite while we have his treasured service."
,bktheman,2012-07-21T01:36Z,"@Knightime
TRUE

@ otheres
stop wasting time... MAKING replis to an a**hole.. people.
he's not worth it."
,coldblooded_wolf,2012-07-21T05:17Z,"@Blezza
You ungrateful bastard. YIFY provides us with free entertainment and great quality movies with great audio and video, and then you come running your mouth with all your crap. Who cares if you don't like a movie, there are your tastes and then there is everyone else's. It's easier if you just don't download and shut the fuck up. You're doing all of us a favor if you don't download from YIFY again, you're a disgrace to thepiratebay community.

You must be gay if you insult YIFY

@flipendo
You're the same piece of shit Blezza is.

@YIFY
Thanks for all the entertainment you provide! Keep it up!"
,Abductor,2012-07-21T05:43Z,Blezza you'll show him by not downloading and taking your sorry bitchass elsewhere to make other people miserable! Cool.

,TheMXL,2012-08-02T06:25Z,"2.8 Ratings, definite LOL "
,Blezza,2012-08-21T11:36Z,"Funny that you would curse me out and insult me while calling me immature. Double moral ftw? 

There's a reason i typed what i typed, that anyone would upload this movie is incomprehensible. It's possibly one of the worst movies ever made in the history of the planet. I expected more from YIFY, therefor my response.

I also thought he was a nicer guy, but he proved me wrong on that one too.

And i haven't downloaded any YIFY movies since i typed that.. And good riddance, no more out of sync audio and shittyass video quality.

Peace out, fuckfaces."
,jessiestmcleod,2012-09-07T21:56Z,"Thanks @YIFY !!!
I am a HUGE Miley fan too :) :) :)

So to @Blezza fuck off! Just because you don't like Miley doesn't mean shit, a million other people do! Including the person who put this up. If you don't like it you don't have to fucking comment or watch it. No one made you come to this movie link! You're terribly dramatic ""oh I am never ever downloading from you again because you put this up"", wah wah how old are you?! Well if that is your mentality, good luck finding anyone to download from that is going to cater to your likes and only ever put up movies that you think aren't shitty. 
Sorry, but I stick up for people in general who don't deserve it. @YIFY put this up for others to enjoy and should only be thanked for doing so. Not critisized!

Don't worry @YIFI, for the one person you lost downloading from you, you gained another :) So @Blezza, I'm sure you're no loss to him lol."
,jessiestmcleod,2012-09-07T21:58Z,@coldblooded_wolf and @Knightime I 100% second you guys on your comments! Both of you are correct! Good to see some others sticking up for people who help others out with free entertainment and should be praised!
,jessiestmcleod,2012-09-07T22:06Z,"While you may think this is one of the shittiest movies on earth, and you are more than entitled to that opinion, many others that love her want to see it just because she stars in it. It was a limited release and many of her fans like me were unable to go see it. I couldn't afford to drive hours and hours away with gas and movie costs to see it! This is the only way I will ever be able to see this!
And for that I am just thankful. So who cares if you hate it? Why insult the person who put it up? You could have just said plain and simple "" I personally thought this movie sucked but thats just my opinion"". That would have been a much nicer way to express your feelings. 


....Did anyone ever teach you some manners? You know being grateful that anyone is using there time by giving you FREE entertainment no matter what it is? Did you pay to see this...No. So get over it and just be grateful. Damn."
