are identical to the free version.
copying the branding.dll to your free install will turn that into the pro version."
[T],iahq76,2012-07-18T06:18Z,"@xpmole: ya you got right, Not only branding.dll but .dat file contain registring details too, these both files turn it to pro version, also you can update program anytime if availble"
,xpmule,2012-07-19T06:50Z,"Good release and good job !
And thank you very much for taking the time and effort to share with us all :)

ps:
and yeah i did copy the other files too ;)
I looked at  changing the resources strings just for the hell of it but the branding.dll has a digital cert. You can get a command line tool online that strips away the cert data on an .exe or .dll etc and it works great but i figured i'd just leave it alone.
If interested google for ""delcert.exe""
or go here..
