  The award-winning Max Payne franchise put players in the role of Max Payne, a
  hard-boiled New York City detective with a penchant for violence, out to
  avenge the death of his family. The latest installment delivers more of the
  classic elements and hyper-intense action that fans have come to love, while
  moving the story of Max in a new direction. 

  Since leaving the NYPD and New York itself behind, Max has drifted from bad
  to worse. Double-crossed and a long way from home, Max is now trapped in a
  city full of violence and bloodshed, using his weapons and instincts in a
  desperate search for the truth and a way out.
