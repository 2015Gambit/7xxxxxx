This torrent contains three different versions in CD of the album "Quiet Life" by British band Japan. Lossless quality. Covers included. Different masterings for different tastes. If you don't like them, you can always buy the remaster, anyway...

Quite possibly the very best album of a criminally underrated band. The title track, along with other songs such as "Fall in Love with Me" "Despair" or "In Vogue" are all classic stuff.
