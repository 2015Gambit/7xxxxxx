 This is the story about the resilience shown    
 by the Indians when they were under the British 
 Rule. They are already taxed to the bone by     
 the British and their cronies, but when Jack    
 Russell announces that he will double the Lagaan
 (tax) from all villagers, they decide to oppose 
 it. Leading the villagers is a handsome young   
 man named Bhuvan, who challenges them to a      
 game of cricket, a game that is to be played    
 by veteran British cricket players, versus      
 villagers, including Bhuvan himself, who have   
 never played this game before, and do not       
 even know a bat from a piece of wood. As the    
 challenge is accepted, the interest grows       
 and attracts Indians from all over the region,  
 as well as the British from all over the country
 - as everyone gathers to see the 'fair play'    
 that the British will display against their     
 counter-parts, who are aided by none other      
 than the sister, Elizabeth, of Captain Rusell.
