,molsonator,2012-07-19T15:31Z,Just watched the trailer.  Yuck if her name is LOL. OMG FML. Gonna put it on the Do not watch list.
,paprboy,2012-07-19T17:34Z,"According to my knowledge this is the remake of the original movie called ""LOL"", which was actually better (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194616/). This movie can best be described by this review:

""If there's one way to describe this movie, it would be utterly atrocious, execrable trash. In no way are there any redeeming qualities in this ""film"" as it is filled with a moronic plot, hideous dialog (if you can call it that) banal acting and overall crap."" (Imdb, 2012)"
,vangefinn,2012-07-19T20:00Z,"Hahahahaha, check this review out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592873/

,KKKDownlow,2012-07-20T02:08Z,If Miley Cyrus doesn't show any skin this there is absolutely no reason to even watch this movie. Would be a complete waste of bandwidth and time.
,logan-x-art,2012-07-20T03:07Z,Id rather watch two dogs fuck...
,Rush,2012-07-20T03:20Z,"Miley Cyrus's LOL was a huge bomb/flop, with an average screening attendance of less than three people. (filmdrunk.com)"
,Mr.Danny,2012-07-20T10:44Z,"worst movie ever

,catfly,2012-07-20T13:11Z,They make these shite movies to pay us back for stealing the good ones.
,Cooltros,2012-07-20T14:16Z,"This movie is poop dw about watching, the story line and acting is poop. not worth the download."

,govermint,2012-07-21T00:30Z,"I died when i read this review:

""I'm going to summarize here:

This ""film"" bears about as much connection with modern society as KFC represents the life of Chickens. Not only is it the most cheese filled pap ever, it's a walking clichĂŠ and the people in it, even say the word ""LOL"" rather than actually laughing, in one scene; one person even rolls around the floor laughing when she is told a joke by her friend, and it wasn't even funny. 

The entire dialogue in this film looks as if it has actually been written on a Nokia 3310 by a 10 year old boy, who has ADHD, no offence to people who actually HAVE ADHD, but seriously, it's like they've given a child three things:

1. MDMA.

2. 90 Blank Sheets of Paper and a typewriter.

3. 2 Days to complete it.

The acting is below par and even in one scene, it is blatantly obvious that the actress has forgotten her lines, so she seems to make her line up on the spot. How on earth did Demi Moore get roped into this? Demi Moore has made some god awful movies in her time, but this will be a black hole on her CV for many years to come and I imagine she is only kicking herself to the loony bin for partaking in this absolute rubbish."""
,dinamocy,2012-07-21T04:17Z,"horrible, horrible movie..."
,Irishramb,2012-07-21T06:38Z,A 2 on IMBD? lmfao
,murtaza786,2012-07-21T11:00Z,"for all the haters of this movie, just hear me out
few movies are intended for general public whereas few are targeted for specific ages only. This movie is for a teenager only. i being a teenager regard it as an average movie not a pathetic movie... if u are above 20 and regarding it as poor u are not doing it justice... 
p.s whatever the age Miley sucks big time! :P I cannot understand why she is selected for the role...
thanks SaM

,Rush,2012-07-21T20:38Z,@murtaza786... When I was a teenager I would have shot everyone in the theater with my AR-15 then shot myself in the face with my Glock for the misery we had to endure after the first ten minutes of this royal POS.
,showlover,2012-07-22T04:31Z,The movie is AWESOME !! thanks so much ! 
,WheeL-Man,2012-07-22T16:02Z,RoflmFFaO!!! TooToofunny!! NO TY I'll pass! thank you guys for the comments. and thank you most of all SaM for great uploads. but yea... next movie for me :P

,dmar20,2012-07-23T08:22Z,Oh my! I love you guys on piratebay always keep me crying in laughter. The review are so bad I have to watch it! I read every comment and I gotta say I love you guys! (LOL hahahh movie pun)
,aradiel,2012-07-23T19:31Z,"This is a remake of a French movie, and they've taken all the best parts of that movie and just Americanized them until there's nothing good left.

In this version, the main character is an annoying whiney little bitch, so Miley is actually perfectly cast in the role."
,tiz2,2012-07-24T16:10Z,@ Rush: But as you get older it's like: Why bother? Now it's up to a new generation to keep the 3 year cycle of random massacres in America going. Remember to support the NRA. 
,Subtracting,2012-07-24T19:13Z,Garbage movie for fags.
,zakimar,2012-07-25T14:40Z,Demi Moore in a film playing second fiddle to Miley Cyrus?! No wonder this thing sucked!
,murtaza786,2012-07-25T19:30Z,"@rush... ur comment describes u, not the movie itself"

thanx all to hell for bringing your political left wing crap into the comment section. STFU, with your liberal BS. 

Right to bear arms is a law (deal with it) and if I want to shoot my hand cannon I will (i dare you to take it from my kung fu grip)
"
,ViolentC,2012-08-15T18:05Z,Miley Cyrus is a victim of MK Ultra Mind Control. she is basicly a robot with no free will of her own. I feel sorry for her and her Father Billy Ray Cyrus.
