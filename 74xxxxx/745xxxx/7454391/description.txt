                           DESCRiPTiON 

 A profile of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the 100m runner fast becoming a legend of 
 the sport, and five of his closest competitors who are aiming to beat him at London 
 2012. While the 2008 Olympic gold medalist will go into the Games as favourite to 
 triumph, he is expected to face a stern challenge from Asafa Powell, Christophe 
 Lemaitre, Tyson Gay, Justin Gatlin and most notably Yohan Blake, who recently 
 finished ahead of Bolt in the Jamaican Olympic trials while also recording the 
 fastest time this year. Narrated by Reggie Yates, with analysis from Michael Johnson.
