Day of Reckoning is the second album by Pentagram. It was released in 1987 by Napalm Records. It was re-released by Peaceville Records in 1993, as part of a 2CD split with Relentless in 1996, and then again in 2005 as a digipak. Joe Hasselvander originally played drums on only one track, "Burning Savior," with Stuart Rose recording the drums on all the rest. Hasselvander re-recorded drums on all tracks (except "Burning Savior") for the '93 Peaceville Reissue. The original mixes with Rose on drums only appear on the Napalm Records LP version and have never appeared on CD.
