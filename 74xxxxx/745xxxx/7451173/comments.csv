Basicly download Lame.exe and copy it to your dBpoweramp install folder.
If you find and update the contents of ""mp3 (Lame).txt"" it will then now show the current Lame Build # in the Config tool.

What i did was go to http://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php
And downloaded the one with NO libsndfile support and NOT x64
Since dBpoweramp is an x86 program you can't use 64bit .dlls with it.. don't bother trying

Hope this is useful for someone and i tested a conversion and it seems to work perfect, new files say 3.99.5 instead of 3.98.4 for example in dBpoweramp context properties and on MediaInfo."

Its free and easy to find and is loaded with features such as methods of validating the images / tracks were ripped correctly. I'm not the only one that likes this either a LOT of people recommend this tool also."
