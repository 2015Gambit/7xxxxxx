,Samablam,2012-07-20T00:42Z,THERES NOTHING ON HERE DONT DOWNLOAD!!
,GIANNIS511,2012-07-20T15:48Z,@Samablam: Do you even know how to open the files? I downloaded the torrent in another computer and it works just fine. Every file I upload is checked by me personally. So guys don't listen to Samablam. 
,Samablam,2012-07-25T22:40Z,how come it just shows white pages then? how would i get it to work? i use ComicRack which uses .cbr. so please help me. ive been readin comic like this for a long time and this is the first time this happened to me
,GIANNIS511,2012-07-27T16:29Z,"I just downloaded and installed ComicRack and it works just fine. Maybe you have an old version of ComicRack and you should download the latest one. I got to tell you though, I find ComicRack a bit slow so if you have problems with other files, maybe you should change it. As I said in the beginning though the file works perfectly."
,Samablam,2012-07-29T22:08Z,ok thanks it works now sorry for the comotion
,GIANNIS511,2012-07-29T22:42Z,It's okay. Just when you have a problem with a file ask if there is a solution first ;).
