iTubeX allows you to download videos (Flash, HTML5 and others), .mp3 and .swf files from almost every website as easily as possible. You can also choose to save only the audio of a video as a .mp3 file and save complete webpages as .jpg, .png, .tiff, .pdf (with or without links) or .eps files. iTubeX also has a feature to convert files into a lot of other filetypes, for the iPhone, iPod Touch, other mobile phones and even more filetypes. iTubeX is available in English and Dutch and requires an Intel Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
