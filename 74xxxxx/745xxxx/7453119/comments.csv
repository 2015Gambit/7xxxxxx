,TheOctopus,2012-07-19T18:50Z,Works great except most of the textures don't render. I'm seeing a lot of blackness. Is this just me?
,sbseed,2012-07-21T14:19Z,"depends on how you are running the program octopus...

are you running it strait up without any dosbox on windows OS or something else.
if its windows 7 you might have some of that anyway, you might not be able to do anything about it... however run the program as if it was windows 98 or xp."
,TheOctopus,2012-07-22T21:18Z,Like run with compatibility? 
,BrianSeym,2012-07-25T10:53Z,"The game was made for Windows 7, why would you need to run compatibility?"
,epiplon,2012-07-29T04:39Z,"It worked pretty well.
Too bad it didn't run on my Intel GPU."
,Dakrid,2012-08-06T04:11Z,My pc says there is a virus.... I'm trusting you...
