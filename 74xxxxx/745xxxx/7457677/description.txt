Hey, Listen!

Another Fix!

In this version:

Fix 2
+ Added the standalone version of HacX (a New game wololololo)
- Removed some useless lines at the end of zdl.ini

Fix 1
+ Shortcut to PWADs folder in the Start Menu

ATTENTION: THIS PATCH WILL REBUILD THE ZDL.INI FILE SO IF YOU JUST ADDED A NEW GAME OR SOURCE PORT TO THE COLLECTION YOU'LL LOSE IT... IN THIS CASE, SEARCH FOR THE CONTENT OF THE FIX ON GOOGLE AND FIX IT YOURSELF :)


OH YEAH CHECK THIS!
THE FIXES ARE CUMULATIVE SO YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE NEWEST VERSION...
IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T DOWNLOAD THE FIX 1, IT IS USELESS NOW :)
