,kvolume,2012-07-20T11:52Z,"Having similar problems with these torrents. They'll play perfectly for a few minutes, and if I hit a certain mark the sound will be inaudible. I can restart the video and skip over that part, and the audio will stay good, but it's still annoying.

I don't get this problem with any other videos. I don't use any hardware acceleration, audio filters, etc."
,ShockDiamond,2012-07-21T14:28Z,"There have been some issues at random times in random places where the audio pixelates - however, it had only done so when streaming to my HDTV and not on my PC.  The wireless adapter that came with my Samsung HDTV is a turd anyway and the problem didnât occur on my PC, so I didn't really have much concern at the time.

The issue also went away by seeking back a few seconds.  This was tested with the source video, which is incredibly raw (huge bitrates).  I have not experienced the issue with the released version at all when I tested it to ensure the audio synced properly.

Regardless of consideration and testing, clearly some people have problems with the releases.  Due to these issues apparently stemming directly from the source, I have very little recourse.  I apologize for the inconvenience of having to restart or ""seek-to-sync"" to work around the issue.

If you have an issue with anything I have or do release, you can email shockdiamondrls[at]gmail.com with the Torrent Name, Issue, Playback Device and Playback Method (hdd, flash, streaming; is it over 100mbit, 1000mbit, wireless; on PC, Mac, HDTV, software used, etc.).  Itâs the only way I can narrow down the cause or incompatibilities, given the hundreds (or more) devices, playback methods, software, so on and so forth.

I may be able to find a common reason as to why this occurs sometimes and for some people and not always with everyone.  Don't worry about your email address - I won't sell it or spam it or sell it on the black market for cabbage and cat food."
