Many thanks!!!"

,Boskius,2012-08-08T09:25Z,"Hey guys I'm getting this after i install:

Mono Class PostProcessAttribute couldn't be found! This might lead to random crashes later on!

and it wont let me play nor build, it exits....any clue?"

The problem with it is when you want to Build and Run a Windows platform game, it returns an error and you can't play it.  Webplayer works fine."
