Stephen Sondheim's Assassins, The Original Off-Broadway Cast Recording



 I've never been too big on musicals, but this has always been one of my favorite albums regardless. After realizing I had no way to get a hold of it through the internet I spent months trying to find a copy of the CD, and now I've finally got around to uploading it here so no one else has to search for it like I did.

This was ripped from the original RCA Victor 1991 release using EAC.
