I directed this movie. Clearly some of you didn't get the joke that this movie is supposed to be cheesy and silly (it IS called Jurassic Shark after all), but that's ok.
What bugs me though is how many people are downloading the movie illegally. I'm an indie guy and made this movie for peanuts out of my own pocket. I have a family to feed, same as you guys. If folks who are downloading it would be cool enough to paypal me even a buck for their download, that would be appreciated. Find me at www.brettkelly.net
you can hate the movie if you want or love it if you want, but making movies is expensive and long hours, be cool about it. thanks!"
