,ajnsd,2012-07-18T21:21Z,"Ya, it's a CAM so yes it sucks when compared to regular torrents. Be that as it may, when judged against other CAM up's, it's pretty good. 
A: 4
V: 4

I saw the movie the whole way through, and it was watchable. "

It use to mean quality
now it means post it fast no matter what shit
quality it might be
you should be proud"
,Rush,2012-07-18T23:20Z,"@MIAMIRON9.... IT'S A CAM, cam rip's only get so good period. You absolutely can not compare  cam rips to any other type of upload.

Wait for a DVDRip if you want high quality, watch a CAMRip if you just can't wait, but don't trash the uploader, no one is forcing you to download it. 

Since you pretty much already know the quality of this type of upload, STFU and show some respect to S4A for doing something that your worthless ass isn't capable of."
,BillyJeanisnotmylover,2012-07-18T23:28Z,"I know I don't need to check this one, but can someone please tell me how I can use my antivirus software to check a file i want to download? I remember doing it before but i cant for the life of me remember how... losing my mind need help lol"
,Rush,2012-07-19T01:53Z,"@BillyJeanisnotmylover..... not sure what your asking, you can't check a torrent that's not yet on your puter. 

Your av can tell you if it's got a virus or not by right click on containing folder BEFORE opening and scan via context menu."
,Rush,2012-07-19T01:58Z,"Quit spamming your stupid ripoff websites, if we wanted to fill out surveys and give up our whole life's history to watch a fucking movie we wouldn't be here would we?

Nuthins really free but this is as close as it gets, just watch out for ""luv letters"" from people you don't luv. (MPAA Gestapo)"
,PokerPimp,2012-07-19T08:41Z,"I did DL this whole torrent.. quality is  blurry but even worse the video is choppy, almost like a lag, but the audio is in sync, so it kind of reminds me of Blair Witch. I do not know if it is meant to be filmed as though someone is following the characters with a camcorder, or because this is a cam it just appears that the original was filmed that way. Audio is so low and muffled you have to have the room very quiet to hear and understand this.. 
A-1
V-1
I heard its supposed to be a really good movie, I recommend waiting for a better copy, however thanks for the effort to the uploader."

,LiloVentresca,2012-07-20T08:22Z,Keeping an eye out for the soundtrack. 
,Tom_thomas,2012-07-21T10:13Z,A5 - V2 - waste of time on this one ... Way too close to the screen
,mineslax,2012-07-22T01:02Z,"Quality is typical for a CAM
However, it is only 75 minutes long the complete movie is 131min.
Not a complete movie"
