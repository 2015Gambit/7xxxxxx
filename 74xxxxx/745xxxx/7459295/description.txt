Led by singer Fred Cole, who had formerly been in the Northwest punk 
band the Weeds, the Lollipop Shoppe's sole album (from 1968) ranks 
as one of the better psych-punk LPs, and also as one of the better 
one-shot rock records of the late '60s. Featuring Cole's choked, 
bitter phrasing, the group staked out the middle ground between the 
Seeds (who shared the same manager) and Love, with a bit of fellow 
L.A. psych-punkers the Music Machine thrown in. If comparisons must 
be made, they were definitely closer in tone to Love than the Seeds, 
with a mixture of raunch and reflection in the spirit of Arthur Lee. 
Cole was one of the few psychedelic performers to make a 
contribution during the punk era, surfacing in the Portland punk 
band the Rats in the late '70s. by, Richie Unterberger
