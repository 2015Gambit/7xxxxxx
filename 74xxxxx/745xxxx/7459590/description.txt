The German Airports Team are again setting new standards in terms of quality, realism, and friendly frame rates with their complete overhaul of the German Airports 3 package. All airports are developed according to their actual status with all buildings, objects installments and navigational aids representing the real life airports. Airports included are Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin-Tegel, Paderborn-Lippstadt and Luebeck.

Built on high resolution aerial images the airports and their surroundings show an absolute realistic image of the real world.
