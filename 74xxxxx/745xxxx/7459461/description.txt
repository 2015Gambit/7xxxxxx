Skeptical FBI Special Agent Dana Katherine Scully is reassinged by Divison Chief Scott Blevins to work with the "believer" Fox William Mulder. Their first case together takes them to Bellefleur, Oregon; where the fourth member of the BHS class of '89 has been found dead...with two mysterious pink marks on her back, which all other victims have had.
