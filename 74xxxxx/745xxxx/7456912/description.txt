Six years after the events depicted in Fury3, the Bions (an alien race created by Earth scientists which rebelled and became ruthless killing machines) kill all the Coalition's qualified pilots on Sebek.[3] The player's character ("the Councilor") is the last surviving pilot for the Coalition of Independent Planets, the defense group that protects Earth from the Bions. The Bions are now targeting the rest of the Coalition's citizens. The pilot must accomplish various objectives on eight different worlds in order to stop the Bions, save Earth, and win the game. The storyline is a continuation of the storyline from Fury3.
