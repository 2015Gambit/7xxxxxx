If you are having trouble adding .mkv files to your WMP library for streaming, like I did, just change the extension on the movie file from .mkv to .mpg or .wmv or whatever (i.e. change 'casa de mi padre.mkv' to 'casa de mi padre.mpg') and you should be able to add them and then stream them. They still might not play in WMP properly, because WMP doesn't really support .mkv files the way it should, but they should stream fine. It works for me all the time. For playing directly on the computer I use the KMPlayer, myself. I only use WMP for streaming to my bluray, because other than that I think it is terrible."
