of course i'm registered at eztv.it
but its cool to see the same torrents here too
(i'm assuming the eztv user name is related)

also i noticed various sites only posting the ""Compulsion"" release of this (its hdtv x264 also)
So is this a dupe ? does it matter wich one is used ?
I'm gonna assume both releases are good.

FQM, ASAP, AFG , DIMENSION , MOMENTUM , LOL , Fov , TLA , EVOLVE And So on are Scene Groups. The Files are shared on filesharing sites from the original uploader(s) , then  alot of users from Private trackers upload the files, then users from that very same site like EZTV , VTV , ETTV and So on grabs the files,extract it and Reuploads It, Much respect to them for Uploading the file and NOT changing the Filename except adding EZTV ect  to it and Reuploading it to public sites for Peeps that are Not members On those Private sites"
