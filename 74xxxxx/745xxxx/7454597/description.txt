ecoPrint2 Pro Ink and Paper Saver is a printer driver that allows you to control just how much ink you want to use and how you want your pages arranged so that you get the most out of the paper that you have. Cut your ink usage by three fourths, print your whole document on one page or combine pages from different documents ΓÇô or do all three at once. It can be used with any printer, as well as printers shared over any Local Area Network (LAN).

Save your ink and toner

ecoPrint2 Pro can reduce up to 75% of your ink usage and works on both color inkjet printers and laser printers, even if the printer in question is installed on a networked computer. Our technology ensures that your overall print quality is not sacrificed in the process.

Save your paper

2, 4, 6, 8 or 16 pages can be printed on a single sheet of paper. Margins can be adjusted, and unnecessary pages can be deleted before printing.

Integrate your documents

Word, Excel, PowerPoint documents and web pages can be imported into the preview window and saved as a single file. Individual pages can be rearranged, rotated and removed as needed. You can also add page numbering, watermarks and comments to the pages.
