[V],psspss,2012-07-19T03:42Z,"I only spotted audio out of sync in the last segment..
prob about 200ms was mnior though as it was almost ended

since I watched it fully before bed

I watched using vlc (videolan.org)

if you want to fix it do so.. avidemux.org

load it.. and tick time shift and enter the
ms out of sunc value.. file pulldown and save avi"
[V],psspss,2012-07-19T03:47Z,"actually is over all out of sync by +200ms

can fix in tools pull down and +200 if watching in VLC

or avidemux.org and time shift 200 and re save the avi will take less then a min to have a fixed copy

sorry about that.. I did check it.. but was in a rush 

can never rely on any video converter to always do it correctly can you.. avs converter and umile all have problems but thats life"
