,magictuga,2012-07-22T06:36Z,"I just registered to say that extremezone is by far the best uploader in this site. When i want to find a movie i dont even look to others torrents, just go to ez page and iam sure the quality is guaranted.
I will stop using pirate bay today cause iam totaly against the site owners who took the vip scule from ez. They should treat him like a god instead of being a bunch of retards."
,EZ.BAY,2012-07-24T03:02Z,"magictuga has the point. Trying to understand why, and I think I share opinion with many EZ suporters. What happened, did he ilegaliy downloaded some movies to Pirate Bay, than I understand...LOL
Mayby PB is working on a gold scull so meainwhile EZ has to go with hot pink.
Thanks EZ for the great work A/V 10++ without watching."
,EZ.BAY,2012-07-28T04:49Z,"WOW, that's it...VIP again...hmm it's nice, and congrats extremezone...maybe is not gold yet but green will sufice for now. From now on I will reffer to you as the Captain EZ."
,BoxcarWillie,2012-08-10T22:30Z,I don't really care what the color of the scull is. EZ is the shiznitz    :)
