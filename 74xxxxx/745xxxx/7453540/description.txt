Network-based Collaborative Project Management
Collaborate with others on the same project file over the LAN or WAN with a single mouse click.
Access Control for Users and User Groups
Resources can be either single Users or grouped into Resource Groups both of which can be assigned to activities and/or given specific access rights.
Dynamic Planning Mode
Activities which haven't started yet can be automatically moved to the current date. This is great news for devotees of Agile Project Management.
