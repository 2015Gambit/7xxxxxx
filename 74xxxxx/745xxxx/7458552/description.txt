Hover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.

Note: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.


Virus scanner results

All virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.
