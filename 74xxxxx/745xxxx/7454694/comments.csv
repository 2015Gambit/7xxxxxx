,threadz,2012-07-19T11:54Z,"Yes sound is not mixed very well.  Too much road/rider and not enough of Phil and Paul.  Sometimes you can barely hear them.  I've noticed the streaming SBS can be like this.  

Shame the broadcaster doesn't realise the poor sound mixing and do something about it."
,pbnjelly,2012-07-19T18:54Z,This whole series of episodes from SBS Australia has the sound getting progressively out of sync with the video (only to be resync-ed by stopping and starting playback)....I am using Handbrake to convert file using preset AppleTV2 setting and playing back via AppleTV2.
