Dave Boyer was Master of Ceremonies at the famous 500 Club in Atlantic City, New Jersey back in the late 50s and early 60s.

Success began for him at the early age of 18 when his manager suggested he change his name to Joey Stevens.

As MC, he was introducing and performing with such well-known entertainers as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Jerry Lewis.

But with the success, Dave became addicted to alcohol and other drugs. His life became self-centered with fame and fortune.

In 1964, his wife June, left him, taking their daughter with her. Less than a year later, DaveΓÇÿs father, a minister in York, Pennsylvania, passed away.

At that point, his self-inflicted hurt became too much. He left the 500 Club that night and drove towards a little town in Pennsylvania where he hoped to kill himself on the railroad tracks.

On the way, however, he passed a little church that brought back happy memories of his childhood, his father and family. Hurting and crying, he fell to his knees, and then forced himself to a pay phone where he called his brother who was now pastor of  his fatherΓÇÿs church.

His brother drove out to meet him and in the wee hours of the morning after a lot of praying, Joey Stevens was laid to rest forever and Dave Boyer was reborn in Christ.
