you got a skull you should know better than posting about a TV show that just aired being a dvdrip"
,ziggyff,2012-07-17T05:36Z,how r these people (ettv and eztv) getting TPB to show such large seeder numbers each week when I can only see  a few in actuality ...does posting larger numbers get more users involved in the process perhaps?
,ziggyff,2012-07-17T05:50Z,what happened to my comment on the seeder numbers??

Because ""FaMoUz"" has uploaded the same episode last week and he gave you the link to it:

,acsmith1972,2012-07-17T07:15Z,Apparently learning to count is hard for these guys.

May be because this month the 13th fall on Friday, and some people feel bad about it. However it is one price take or leave it."

an advanced copy for screening maybe but actual dvd i dont think so as its missing the Xmas bonus episode witch is in the season 5 dvd set unless you made this your self and have proof its from the real dvd i still call bull i'll wait a few days and get a better quality one of the real release

might also be a reason why this got labeled E14"
,rocket221,2012-07-17T20:15Z,Where is the actual S05E14 The Final Ending?
,Sick3r,2012-07-18T01:59Z,rocket221: There are only 13 episodes. This is the same as 05-13
,rocket221,2012-07-19T08:35Z,"@Sick3r
It was listed on thetvdb, but it's gone now someone must have made a mistake."
