Good actors, bad director."
,catfly,2012-07-19T09:58Z,Why do they make such crap films now? its hard to find anything worth watching even for free! What a waste. Must be a tax dodge.
,catfly,2012-07-19T10:20Z,"Sadly the rating on IMDB for this is over 6.0... they must have rigged it, cos the reviews all say it was terrible.
If they're gonna rig IMDB, then.. well who can i trust but my comerades on piratebay?"

,SativaMeAt420,2012-07-20T22:37Z,"I completely agree, modern cinema is really starting to let me down, all I have to say is they better not bastardize the new Robocop in 2013. "
,iamchrislechat,2012-07-21T02:50Z,christian slater and donald sutherland.... Yes!!! my time machine worked!!!
,opensociety,2012-07-22T11:28Z,"This is a truly boring movie, the director needs to learn about tempo...

However:

Technical quality is ok! 

TNX for the effort!!! (Maybe somebody will like the movie, nothing wrong with the actors, but...)."
