,Darth_Adversor,2012-08-18T23:39Z,"It seems that Slysoft has gotten really good at somehow blacklisting these cracks.  I had a version of 7.0.4.1 (from this uploader) that worked for a little while, but it got shut down recently.  And both releases of 7.0.5.0 that I've found aren't working either (this one included).  It's looking like Slysoft is requiring an internet connection to use the program (keeps giving some error about the ""update server"") so maybe that's how they're doing it.  Anyway, disappointing.  Does anyone know of any alternatives to AnyDVD?  

If anyone is getting success with this download, please post.  Maybe I'm just a tard."
