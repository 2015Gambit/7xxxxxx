Everything worked fine for me. Open 'kg' folder, mount 'core_keygen.dmg', launch 'CORE Keygen.app', replace in the 'CORE' blue window 'symmetry // CORE' by the name your prefer and press 'generate' to get a serial. Then, after launching 'Disk Drill.app' and declared 'I have already the PRO version', just fill the blank fields in the registration window by the name and the serial written in the Keygen window. Done."
