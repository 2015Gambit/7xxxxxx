 Summary ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ: Left on a nun's doorstep, Larry, Curly and Moe grow
                   up finger-poking, nyuk-nyuking and woo-woo-wooing 
                   their way to uncharted levels of knuckleheaded 
                   misadventure. Out to save their childhood home,
                   only The Three Stooges could become embroiled in
                   an oddball murder plot, while also stumbling into
                   starring in a phenomenally successful TV reality show.
