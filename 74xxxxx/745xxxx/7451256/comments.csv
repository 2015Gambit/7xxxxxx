,kokak2010,2012-07-18T21:57Z,How come there's a HEUR virus detected by AVG?
,kokak2010,2012-07-18T22:00Z,The CRACK had HEUR virus detected by AVG
[V],ChattChitto,2012-07-18T23:05Z,"Your the only one reporting that + It's ""AVG"" finally.. not just one of the worse Anti-Viruses, the worth after McAfee!"
,serpentpan,2012-07-19T02:39Z,"Thanks man.Easy install,fine working."
,serpentpan,2012-07-19T02:41Z,"It's false positive.I have  NOD32,W7X64 without problems."

,serpentpan,2012-07-30T13:06Z,"Sometimes when I used a cracked programm with open internet,the site put my IP in black list and blocked the programm.Then I unistalled completely with Revo-and I looked also in registry place with regedit.exe and I tried to reinstall the programm after one-two weeks,usually without problems and with CLOSED NET."
,enozdaed,2012-08-04T03:05Z,"serpentpan, that worked!  Thanks so much!  I had tried deleting everything before and nothing seemed to stop it.  I will make sure I am never connected to the net when running now."
,-PLP-,2012-08-11T14:56Z,"I get a problem with this edition.
For all discs it says:

ERROR processing disc, AnyDVD turned off!

Any clue?"
,darko5555,2012-08-16T08:11Z,"This torrent has some sort of virus or some sort malicious code in it, as it showed a DOS screen claiming it was a antivirus, My anti virus doesn't show any dos screen because it doesnt start before windows.

So whats up ChattChitto? Why the dick move?"
,darko5555,2012-08-16T08:13Z,"After installing my computer showed a DOS screen stating my antivirus is removing files.

My antivirus doesn't do any such thing, the only thing I installed was this program as such I believe there is a virus such as kokak2010 stated.

Don't download."
,darko5555,2012-08-16T08:16Z,"It seems to me that kokak2010 was right that this torrent does have a virus.

A DOS screen poped up before windows even started and told me my ""antivirus"" was removing files from my PC. As my antivirus Bit Defender, doesn't run before windows I know it was not my antivirus. Much less it's probably a backdoor to my computer.

Wouldn't download again, you shouldn't either."
,Darth_Adversor,2012-08-18T23:38Z,"It seems that Slysoft has gotten really good at somehow blacklisting these cracks.  I had a version of 7.0.4.1 that worked for a little while, but it got shut down recently.  And both releases of 7.0.5.0 that I've found aren't working either (this one included).  It's looking like Slysoft is requiring an internet connection to use the program (keeps giving some error about the ""update server"") so maybe that's how they're doing it.  Anyway, disappointing.  Does anyone know of any alternatives to AnyDVD?  

If anyone is getting success with this download, please post.  Maybe I'm just a tard."
,serpentpan,2012-08-19T15:47Z,Arko5555 and Darth_Adversor the programm I don't think that has a virus.It's like the problems with ElbyCDIO.dll.The programm runs fine for me and CC I think that has clean torrents.
,unholyman,2012-08-22T22:56Z,I installed and used it for several weeks an I didnt have any problems what so ever AVG picks up every hack I have seen as a virus A simple file that changes windows XP's activision so you never have to activate it says its a virus.... ChattChitto Nice work.. 
,umdesch4,2012-09-06T06:30Z,"Just wanted to add my thanks. I installed this and ran it no problem. I was trying to rip my friend's Afro Samurai Resurrection DVD so he could watch it on his tablet, and DVD Decrypter kept getting bad sectors, suspiciously right at the start of the first VOB file, and the end of the last VOB file in the main title. Turns out AnyDVD says ""Found & removed 15 potential bad sector protections"".
...and it ripped like a charm after that."
