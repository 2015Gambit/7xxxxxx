Dumb Drunk and Racist S01E01-E05 xvid avi - Aus MiniDocu-Reality Series (2012)

I sourced these from various places and bundle.. I think theres 6 episodes for the series.. heres just 5 of them so far..
some are rips from tv and some from web stream so quality
varies from watchable to very good
all are xvids.. at least 640x360p mp3

I havent had time to watch any but sounds like it could be funny
and entertaining

The guys gets 4 indians to tour Australia with him and visit and 
talk about some of the hot spots and opinions and image
of Australia.. 

I havent official blurred on the program.. someone can dig up and
post a comment if they want

Help to seed if grabbing

enjoy
