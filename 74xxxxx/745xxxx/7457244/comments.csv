Never had such a good laugh.. well worth the watch (up there with Aussie wife swap series)

some of the things they claiming as racist is plain wrong

why should aussie accept all boat people. and its true they need
background checks.. they might be evil people escaping crimes in their
own country

I think theres one thing they havent pointed out.. that many jobs are lost
internal to our countries cos theyre outsourced to india as they
will work long hours for hardly any money .. 

i thought it was funny when the drunk female ab's attacked them as well.. so its cant be cos they are brown faced"

,invenio,2012-08-29T04:43Z,"@psspss There's nothing funny about the topic of Australian boganism aka being dumb, drunk and racist. There is a great deal of racism in Australia, and although it might only be a minority it's a VERY vocal minority.

This series should be mandatory watching for Australians. With its many kilometers of sea coastline Australia has one of the safest borders in the world, yet it complains so much about boat people. About 17,000 people arrived by boat in the last 4 years. That's hardly a threat, but Australia's politicians make boat people and off-shore processing election topics. Europe has far more people coming to its shores and borders. Many more people arrive by boat from Africa, but it's never dramatised as much as in Australia. And, it does really sell there. People fall for that. Deal with a real problem Australia and don't blame anything on its migrants.

I wonder if Australia is scared of boat people and migrants because captain Cook's invaders came by boat themselves. They knew, and know today what it has done to Australia's indigenous population and fear the same might happen to them from migrants.

Aborigines have suffered a great amount in Australia, to an extent that Westeners were not able to cope with. The invasion of Australia has left them with a decimated population, a loss of identity and marginalised in society. The one Indian guest on the show summarised Australia's attitude beautifully (along the lines): ""Australia has put the indigenous issue so deep under the carpet that it not only finds it hard to deal with it, but even think about it.""

So are Australians racist? It's too broad of a statement to impose on everyone. INn addition you might not know if you only spend your time with white Aussies or the second generation of migrants (people born in Australia and who adopted a mostly white Australian lifestyle). But it is also important to note that racism permeates all levels of a society, regardless of education or race. Racism is not a domain of white trash."
