This time Max and Stacy demand that Jamie Dimon leave Earth alone! They also discuss the global Jim Jones like cults surrendering to the derivatives with hostile intent. In the second half of the show, Max talks to Jim Rickards, author of Currency Wars, about 'Singapore on the Mediterranean' and how the U.S. Congress will intervene in the Libor case to avoid the Son of Tarp.
