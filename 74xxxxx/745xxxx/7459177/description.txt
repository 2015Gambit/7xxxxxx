Double your autonomy
Before, your only solution to have a decent battery for your laptop was to buy an extra one. Now, there's a lighter, more efficient, and cheaper alternative: Battery Doubler! Because it doesn't use standard techniques (dim screen light, etc.), but finds out what to turns off what isn't needed, such as, for example, the USB ports, you can get up to twice autonomy without sacrifice comfort.


Decrease recharge time
Your battery recharges much faster if your computer isn't turned on. That's a fact. Let Battery Doubler redefine a few computer facts - with its Turbo Charge technology, increase up to 10% battery recharge speed when your computer is turned on.


Recalibrate damaged batteries
After using your battery a lot without paying attention to discharge and recharge it fully every time, its performance becomes very low. With Battery Doubler, simply run the recalibration wizard that does the entire job for you - automatically!


Easy to use
From the configuration window to the battery status indicator, features, Battery Doubler excels at ease-of use. Our interface fully respects Microsoft's guidelines and is very intuitive. Because you don't always want to read a 300-pages manual before using a software, you will understand how to use Battery Doubler in no time.


And much more 
Battery Doubler features other great functions, such as telling you in hours:minutes your battery's autonomy! It is impossible to list all of Battery Doubler's functions on a single webpage, so why don't you download it and find out how much better your laptop is with it?
