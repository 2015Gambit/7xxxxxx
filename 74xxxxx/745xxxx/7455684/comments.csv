,frm0025,2012-07-22T08:46Z,"@dgirl79 your an idiot. The link here is for ""comments"" that means any comment not just what you deem appropriate. Seems like half the people bitch If there's no A/V comments and the other half bitch If there's no opinion of the movie. Then there's people like me who bitch at the people bitching! Go figure TPB comment section is just one big complaint section!"
,frm0025,2012-07-22T09:03Z,"Oh yeah and also it's just an amazing forum to spout political and religious views that have nothing to do with a movie. So screw negro faces Obama. Im already dreading graduating in two months I guess I'll be using piratebay from here on out since It'll be the only thing I can afford. I'm all about the physibal section. Can't wait to make my own shit and not have to buy anymore plastic crap from china. I'll be able to make my own plastic crap. Maybe Romney our savior will actually turn this country around so I'll be able to afford a movie ticket or DVD like I was able too years ago when white people were in power. I'm not racist just realistic. White peope actually run businesses and make payroll. We grow up wanting to go to college and bet our futures on hard work and education not Rap, ballin, drug dealing, and then when the dream of that fails which it always does they bet on democrats to bail their sorry asses out. I'm not racists. Blacks finally got a black president and black unemployment is as high as its ever been and yet they still have a 97% favoritism towards the great black savior Obama. So whose rasist? I'm not. Blacks have on avg a 17% unemployment rate and black kids from 16-25 have a 70% unemployment rate as if they were wanting to work anyways. I'm all for more McDonald's so we can get these blacks back to work. I'm not racist. My great great great grandfather founded the KKK to reinvigorate the civil war not bc he was a racist so I've for rebel blood deep in me but I'm not racist. I think blacks are really good at sports like fried chicken and watermelon and oh oh collard greens. I'm not racist. Blacks are subhuman. I'm totally rasist. Hopefully we can get this jigger out of office. I'm not racist. I copied and pasted all of this from a previous post thought I'd repost. Bc every TPB comment page needs to be redirected from thr movie to Race, Religion, and or Politics. There you go. I thought wild bill comments were getting to be to much about wild bill."

Come on ! You think Obama's Black and that would be the reason why you cannot afford a ticket ?
Obama's money-green like all your Presidents.
You are not racist but talk 'bout ""Blacks who got what they wanted : hence a Black Pres'"". Isn't it a bit racist to think all ""black"" people want the same thing ? D'you think Colin Powell voted for Obama ? Thanks for the laugh.

Obama Is FAR better than the dumbass WHITE, right-wing christians out there that are all about denying anthropomorphic global warming, killing education, pushing crap like creationism, and bullshit religion. 

Your money was fucked over by BUSH, a WHITE president that started a TRILLION dollar war. Democrats, INCLUDING Obama, have the LOWEST spending. Look at the report FORBES just published. But I guess you're too fucking stupid to read. "

,Wicked920411,2012-07-23T14:03Z,"Okay one, Bush may have been president but he was not the only one whom brought us to war. Also we we in way deep debt before he ran office. Also had we been more smart about the war it would not of cost us so much, Thou it did actually bring the economy up at the start latter decisions brought it down. It helped people out when they got out of high school but then again people left the service shell-shocked(PTSD). And yeah Obama did blow thou the most money. Bush added 2.5 trillion to the public debt. Obama so far has spent 4.9 trillion towards the public debt. The health care system Bush made was 800 million total. Obama's down payment for the beginning of his Health care plan is 691 Million (Down payment not the full amount may I add). And may I add, I'm not racist. I have an open mind, but if you want to bash someone get the facts straight. Bush was a dick but what else do you expect a president to do when people come onto our soil and f*cking kill hundreds of thousands of people. I think I would of gone to war too. Even thou people say it was an inside job. Humans are stupid and over populated and over consuming. I say fuck us and we should all burn in hell (if there was one). Sorry for the run on sentences. May your death be swift and painful. :)"

Mister please !  I didn’t read the piece of crap of frm0025 till the end, just sounded horribly stupid and lots of people visit to this page, it is interesting to write an answer there.
And seriously did you just write a comment without rating in it about the uselessness of comment without rating ? Thus proving to everybody that you care about post without rating ? And that “you pissed in a violin” according to your own standards.
Buy a dictionary and check the definition of indifference.
As another guy said, sometimes comments here are more interesting than what Hollywood produces. In my country, if you are a politician in power, you like in your country a “Republican” (UMP) or a “Democrat” (PS), which is exactly the same thing, keep believing this bipartism is democracy  If you want to change something, you do it at your level (kids, association, etc)."

,frm0025,2012-08-23T09:41Z,As a matter of fact I did check my facts on blacks voting for Obama and how many still would and it's 97% Rasmussen poll so suck it. The facts are facts. And on 60% of white democrats would reelect him and those are only democrats who voted for him I'm talking about. So u tell me that's not racially motivated behavior. I'm against racism in this country as well as racially biased behavior. Im not taking up for any party im merely stating a fact and apparently that makes me a wanker.  Wait till our countries debt is so big we actually default and then tell me What Obama did ro prevent it. Or does he want that? Socialist leftist thrive in depressions. When your choking capitalism out there's no where else for people ro turn but to thr government and that's what he wants. He doesn't want you to be self sufficient.  I've met few people who are on Wellfare that got off of it. Why woul u it's free money. Steal from the rich to give to the poor. Social Justice man. Dig it.
