Lauren OΓÇÖConnell tiptoed onto the music scene with her 2007 debut Sitting in Chairs, a beautifully simple one-track acoustic album. Her third offering Quitters is a lot more confident and has a heck of a lot more gumption in it that the title would suggest. The album captures perfectly the sound of the ultimate American road trip; Lauren herself hailing from Rochester, New York and ending up in California. If big horizons, sunsets and campfires had a soundtrack, it would be this. ItΓÇÖs not quite country and not quite folk, just a lovely happy medium thatΓÇÖs as far from Dolly Parton as it is from Laura Marling.

The album opens with the understated optimism and infectious percussion of ΓÇÿEvery SpaceΓÇÖ, topped off with LaurenΓÇÖs inimitable warm sun-and-whiskey-drenched vocals. ΓÇÿI Will Burn You DownΓÇÖ follows, with jangly guitar and raw, lamenting lyrics; roughly along the lines of ΓÇ£pull yourself together and move onΓÇ¥, just a lot more eloquently put.

The duet ΓÇÿI Belong To YouΓÇÖ, with fellow California-based singer Ryan Lerman, is full of harmonies and oohs and ahhs, and everything you could really ask for from a love song. It features the Wilco-countering line ΓÇ£nothing is just born to dieΓÇ¥ with infinite more positivity and sincerity than Lana Del Rey could ever feign. The dreamy ΓÇÿIn The Next RoomΓÇÖ is the penultimate track on the album, with the strings and keys creating a waltz-like quality.

Considering all this, it would be too easy to mentally file Quitters along with all the twee fauxksters, next to the boutique bunting and teacups gathering dust in the synapse of your brain that resembles an InstagramΓÇÖd basement in Brixton. But thereΓÇÖs something a lot more authentic about this album. The girlΓÇÖs got guts. ThereΓÇÖs plenty of feist in the brutally honest lyrics of ΓÇÿMaybe True StoriesΓÇÖ. ItΓÇÖs also present in the stunning, nearly-eight-minute-long ΓÇÿIf Found/GravityΓÇÖ, which contains the unrelenting refrain of ΓÇ£I want something returned to meΓÇ¥. Perhaps captured within this one song is LaurenΓÇÖs whole musical career thus far; from a sweet and uncertain beginning, to a powerful crescendo of tenacity.

Ignore this review. DonΓÇÖt listen to it. Listen to Lauren OΓÇÖConnell. SheΓÇÖs might not be shouting very loudly, but what she is saying is with conviction, and the way sheΓÇÖs saying it is beautiful.
