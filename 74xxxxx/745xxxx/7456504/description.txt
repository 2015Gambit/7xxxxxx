Howard Sounes, the bestselling author of Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, turns his considerable reporting and storytelling skills to one of the most famous, talented--and wealthiest--men alive: Paul McCartney.
In this engaging, set-the-record-straight biography (Publishers Weekly), Sounes reveals Sir Paul's whole life story, from childhood to present day, working-class Liverpool beginnings to the cultural phenomenon that was The Beatles to his many solo incarnations. Fab delivers the full story behind the legendary musician's marriages, romances, feuds, phenomenal wealth, and complex relationships with fellow ex-Beatles. The result is "a must for Beatles and McCartney fans...the first comprehensive, candid, and up-to-date portrait" (Booklist," starred review) of McCartney, a man of contradictions and a consummate musician.
