,TakatoSan,2012-07-19T23:31Z,If you'd like me to seed faster then tell me how to use the super-seed function. It doesn't seem to work in uTorrent 1.8.2. ._.
,MPenguin,2012-07-20T16:55Z,"1) Upgrade your uTorrent.
2) Open the properties panel for the torrent.
3) Go to ""Advanced...""
4) Check ""Initial Seeding""

Profit!"
