POtHS Comments on This one......... There is truth here for all ages and beliefs. If Darwin was wrong...........then the Schools have been intentionally lying to our Children. If the schools teach Darwinism which says there is NO CHRIST. Then they are of The Anti-Christ. Public Schools teaching books CHANGE EVERY YEAR. The Bible never changes. So where is truth??? In Evolution Theories??? If you believe in Evolution you are denying The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit of the Praise They are entitled too for making everything you understand and can see and more than that, everything you don't understand and can't see. If you have never thanked the CREATOR for his Creation now is your chance to thank Him.

Description
Evolution - A Crumbling Theory / Evolution - The Grand Experiment:
Prior to the discovery of DNA the only thing evolutionists and creation scientists had to debate about were the morphology of fossils, bones and living species. Because the fossil record was overwhelmingly against the theory of evolution; such as the fact that the predicted gradualism was never observed and intermediate species were rarely found; the theory of evolution was dying a slow death.
