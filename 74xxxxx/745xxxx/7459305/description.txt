Edward Appleby is an musician and composer living in Mobile, Alabama. A state known for its Country music he is far from dime a dozen. When listening to his music I envision myself in a theatrical setting in a big city far from Alabama. His self-described indie folk pop songs with modern classical composition couldn't be more fitting.



He has released four EP's all self-recorded ranging from holiday music ΓÇ£Lo! The Snow in the Chimney Froze!ΓÇ¥ to everyday life ΓÇ£Music for the Living, Vol. 1.ΓÇ¥ All his albums could be made into plays or musicals. They all tell a story in a interesting enticing way that skipping a song is not an option. You will be allured to listen to every song, piece together the information and interpret it to your liking. There is no mistaking that Edward has both artistic and musical talents that should be shared with the world. The way he arranges the instruments to match the feeling of a song is sharp and demands your attention.



His new album now available online ΓÇ£The City (Waiting for the Inevitable Disaster) is another masterpiece. His haunting voice shines on this album and he continues the same successful cinematic arrangement of instruments and back up vocals that has been the foundation of his rare sound. Be ready to be moved by Edward Abbleby as he hits the road to promote his new album.
