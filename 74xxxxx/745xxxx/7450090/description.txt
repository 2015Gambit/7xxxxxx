The Old Grey Whistle Test was a Music Show with few if any restrictions on content which quickly found it became 'cult' viewing.   A single appearance for example on this award winning BBC2 show took Dutch Band 'Focus' from cult status to mainstream Pop with there record Company Polydor having to dedicate one entire plant to pressing there Album and single.

Being the BBC production values, sound and video quality are state of the art for the time and it has taken me many happy hours extracting just the music content and splitting it into single tracks for VJ use while keeping that quality as best I could.
