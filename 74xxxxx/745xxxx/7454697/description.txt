Evo Magazine UK September 2012

Going by the tag-line ΓÇÿThe thrill of drivingΓÇÖ, Evo magazine attempts to immerse the reader in the driving experience of any particular car, and all other aspects are considered secondary to this all emotive ΓÇÿdriveΓÇÖ. While hard data is accumulated in the form of lap-times (for which Evo regularly uses Bedford Autodrome), cornering speeds, and straight-line performance figures, the subjective nature of the driving experience is the paramount factor by which 
cars are graded by Evo.
