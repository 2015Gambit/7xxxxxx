,necr00,2012-07-20T05:24Z,"thx dude, you're the first to upload this i guess!"
,nba2416,2012-07-20T16:20Z,"thanks nepotu. i almost only seed your nba games but i need to finish 2 games, can you seed game 2 of 1987 and 1988 finals? (both missing game 2). thanks!"
,Adonis605,2012-07-20T19:43Z,"thank you my good sir !

,cerealkillah,2012-07-20T20:41Z,"Shiity, download.. It's broken down into quarters, 1,2,and 4 are mkv files and 1 is wmv lol The first part of all the vlc videos are all messed up too.. Not worth the time"
[V],Nepotu,2012-07-20T21:37Z,"You are welcome, guyz!
@nba2416: I don't have those games already. Sorry! I've asked ppl to seed in order to up more games.
@cerealkillah: You have no idea what you talking about. The 1st, 2nd and 4th Q are in flv format and the first part of all video are not messed up. Yes, the vlc player skip directly at 29th min of play for example (in 1st Q) but the quarters are entire (from 29 to 57 = 28 min for the 1st Q). Yes, it worth the time. Unless you don't have a better option. I have a better rip but it is in polish. So, if you don't like it, don't eat it, but stop talking nonsenses!"
,cerealkillah,2012-07-21T00:19Z,"Man, i appreciate u spending time uploading these for all of us I was just saying It was kind of a waste of time for me, because I usually watch on my xbox so I've had to spend almost the whole day converting the files to wmv, and at first they wouldn't even convert because the first parts of them are messed up.. But thanx bro keep up the wrk"
,cerealkillah,2012-07-21T01:11Z,"Hey I was also gonna ask you if you were gonna put up any of the t-wolves summer league games, I've been looking around for them and I haven't found any"
[V],Nepotu,2012-07-21T02:52Z,"Ok, my friend! Your apologizes accepted. But you have to specify why is useless for you. You know that sort of things are rare to find. Now, for the Wolves games I can't do nothing because these games are rarely. All the summer league games that I found are already here. Cheers mate!"
