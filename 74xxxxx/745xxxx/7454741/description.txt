THE THEORY OF FLIGHT (1998)
===========================



Helena Bonham Carter
Kenneth Branagh
Gemma Jones



A dreamer who aspires for human flight is sentenced to public service after one of his less-than-perfect leaps off a downtown public building. This leads him to meet a young, invalid woman who is terminaly-stricken with motor neuron disease. The strong-willed woman admits her wish to lose her virginity before succumbing. Struggling to maintain his relationship with his girl friend, he declines his personal service but offers instead to help pay for an upscale male prostitute to perform the de-flowering. What follows plays off the inherent comedy and drama of the circumstance.
