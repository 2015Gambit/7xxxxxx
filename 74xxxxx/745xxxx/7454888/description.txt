I Love Bees was an Alternate Reality Game made to promote Halo 2, but while I can't remember a thing that happened in Halo 2 anymore I remember almost every word of I Love Bees.

This is a professionally written story about a small group of people connected in ways they're not aware of all trying to keep their lives steady in the midst of galactic war. While you learn about the characters you get clues as to how they relate to the larger narrative being told and as the pieces come together I can guarantee you'll be sucked into this brilliant story.

These files were ripped from the I Love Bees website back when it was new, they can still be found there however.
