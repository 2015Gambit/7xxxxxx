,JiggyJinjo,2012-07-19T10:20Z,"It's very easy and it works i show you my little tutorial to Cr@ck Anna

1: donwload the torrent

2: When it's done download an iso converter( Bin2iso or magiciso...)

3: open your torrent file and extract ""Fan-anna.bin"" on your desktop

4: convert it with your iso converter in Fan-anna.iso

5: Now you have your image CD so drag it in Daemon Tools Lite and select play. Now you gonna install the game once you click play Anna setup.exe will appear, click yes and install the game(remember where you'll put the game installation)

6:When done you have the game in your HD so search it ( if you just clicked ""Yes"" in the install it is in ""Programfiles""). So now let the window with the game instalation open ( in program files if you clicked ""yes"") And click Start => Computer Here you'll see the game Anna in your virtual lector so right click it and choose ""Open""

7: Here you'll see a FANiSO Folder, open it and copy the 2 contents ( but you can juste copy the game application) And now go to your game installation ( in ProgramFiles in you clicked ""yes"") Open the Anna folder and replace the old game application ( You've cr@cked the game ) 
And now you can run the game !

ENjoy :)"
