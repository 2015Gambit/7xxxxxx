   Anna is a short adventure game set in and around an  old  sawmill  near 
   Champoluc  and  Periasc,  a  real-world  environment  we've  faithfully 
   recreated. The game features six, highly detailed locations to explore, 
   in which your alter ego should navigate a  wide  range  of  situations, 
   ranging from solving puzzles to facing the eerie presences  that  haunt 
   the surroundings.
   
   Depending on the mental status of your character (which  is  determined 
   by your actions),  you're  tasked  with  navigating  your  way  through 
   ever-changing places along with their  well  hidden  clues,  eventually 
   leading you to one of three possible endings.

   At a budget price  tag,  the  game  itself  has  been  designed  as  an 
   interactive three-hour singleplayer horror experience.
   
   The OST was performed by the budding  "Chantry"  gothic  band,  now  on 
   their 2nd album "Crystal".
   
   The game is a  PC  exclusive,  featuring  state-of-the-art  models  and 
   shaders that take advantage of the latest technologies available to  us 
   through the power of new developments in graphics hardware.
