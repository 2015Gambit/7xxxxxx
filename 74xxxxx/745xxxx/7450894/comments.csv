,Seralyn84,2012-07-20T09:05Z,"yuioooot, I found that to be the case as well.  I scoured the interwebs and found only one place that had them.

All you do it download the zip, unzip the *.srt file to any location and from your media player, choose >load subtitle file>choose the .srt and it should work instantaneously.

Oh, A/V quality was spot on! Looks beautiful in HD...can't imagine watching this in SD... It was a great documentary too! Moving to Tokyo next month and it really got me psyched!! Enjoy."
,2HardRain,2012-07-20T15:47Z,"Not sure what the previous two are commenting about??? Firstly the whole Doco is in Japanese, secondly there are already english subs for the whole Doc within the movie itself! Seriously wtf?"
,yuioooot,2012-07-21T13:17Z,"2HardRain: Neither Media Player Classic, Haali, or my DVICO TViX shows any subtitles in this mkv."
,mynistry,2012-07-22T02:01Z,"I can't see subtitles either. I have the latest version of VLC lan player, and serviio streaming. I'm running Windows 7."
,erich555,2012-07-23T17:56Z,And of course there are no subtitles. What a surprise.  
[T],solstars,2012-07-24T04:28Z,"Guys... the subs are there in the MKV, but they are in PGS format.  If you want to play them with VLC, you will need to mux in the SRT file (or just open it directly in VLC) from Seralyn84's post above."
,chang104,2012-07-26T11:42Z,"I hope this 720p version will play on my Potplayer or VLC, as the 1080p version didn't!?  I'm not sure why."
,dixiegrl,2012-08-09T22:43Z,"Thank you! 
Ihad to download the subtitles, per directions in the comments, had no problems even tho I have never done it before. 
will seed for a long time."
,torrentwizard,2012-08-20T13:38Z,"Great documentary for sure. But found it funny how he and everybody kept saying ""jiro doesn't care about money, it's about the quality of the fish"". How much does it cost for a 20 pc. sushi dinner, which you must eat in less than 45 minutes, no less $400-$600 per person. "
,pockethotrod,2012-09-16T08:02Z,^ I think it means that he does not make a lot of profit because he has to pay all those suppliers to get the freshest and highest quality ingredients.
,pockethotrod,2012-09-16T16:04Z,"Also, I have the latest VLC media player and I can see the subtitles just fine."
