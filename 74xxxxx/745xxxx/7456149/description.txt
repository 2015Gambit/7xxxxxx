Sean Wilentz discovered Bob DylanΓÇÖs music as a teenager growing up in Greenwich Village. Now, almost half a century later, he revisits DylanΓÇÖs work with the skills of an eminent American historian as well as the passion of a fan.
 
Beginning with DylanΓÇÖs explosion onto the scene in 1961, Wilentz follows the emerging artist as he develops a body of work unique in AmericaΓÇÖs cultural history. Using his unprecedented access to studio tapes, recording notes, and rare photographs, he places DylanΓÇÖs music in the context of its time and offers a stunning critical appreciation of Dylan both as a songwriter and performer.
