Yes, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the series continues its descent into the dark, twisted real world problems that the wizards face. Namely, the addition of an irritating wizard named Tonks to the cast of characters.

Hogwarts is taken over by the Ministry of Magic, who installs a puppet regime in the form of Dolores Umbridge. Because if thereΓÇÖs one thing kids love in their fantasy novels, itΓÇÖs ham-fisted satire of totalitarian regimes! Will Harry master occulmency? Will he describe his first kiss simply as ΓÇ£wetΓÇ¥? Will he severely overreact to the death of a character he had only really met a couple of times? Will Mike, Kevin and BIll imply that Dobby has taken up pimping as a way to earn extra cash? All these questions and more will be answered in the affirmative in this RiffTrax of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!
