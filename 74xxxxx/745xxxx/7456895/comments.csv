,one_of_7.500.000.000,2012-07-20T18:01Z,Wow. I was eight when I went to a concert for the first and last time. I happen to see this was a Dutch Treat selection So I downloaded it (Perfect quality garanteed!). I think I relived my first visit all over again. I did not know classical music could be so beautiful and modern (exciting) at the same time. Many thanks.
