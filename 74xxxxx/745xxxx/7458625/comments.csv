,maxjasper,2012-08-02T01:31Z,"N O T I C E:

For Keygen to report success you need to switch sequence of 2 instructions in Install.txt file as follows (here is correct sequence):

6. Select I have an activation code from Autodesk

7.Once at the activation screen: 
  start XFORCE Keygen by right clicking and run as administrator.

8.Copy the request code into the keygen and press generate

9.Click on Mem Patch (you should see successfully patched)

10.Now copy the activation code back to the activation screen and click Next
  You have a fully registered autodesk product



NB: Make sure you are running the Keygen as administrator [UAC does not matter] on Windows7"
,NlvMike,2012-08-05T22:28Z,"For those having problem with the patch...
Make sure to run the correct keygen (x86 or x64) as administrator.

Chris: any chance to get Autodesk raster 2013 x64? Thanks"
,LipperOX,2012-08-20T19:48Z,"I am running Windows 7-64. I installed this and it worked fine but the activation is not working. I have followed all steps and even reversed the orders as Maxjasper explained. When I hit Patch, it says ""Make sure you can write to current directory"". When I press Generate, it gives me a code that is 7 digits shy of being enough to fill in the form on the AutoDesk activation page. PLEASE HELP ASAP ANYONE! "
,frogfoot1,2012-08-22T02:52Z,"I figured it out. The patch file ""xf-autocad-kg_x64 or 32"" *MUST* be inside the autodesk directory in program files in order to do a complete patch. Once its in the directory, follow the revised steps from Maxjasper.  Cheers!"
,LipperOX,2012-08-22T23:43Z,frogfoot1 - that did it! thank you!
,VR6Cabi,2012-08-28T17:45Z,"HELP!  After I install, I close AutoCAD.  When I reopen, I get a blank ""autodesk licensing"" screen. I close it, click activate, and another blank screen appears.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now, and everytime same thing.  I can't seem to get to the screen to click ""I have an activation code""  any ideas?  I'm running windows 7 professional."
,LOELI12,2012-09-06T20:13Z,Thank you; it works perfect
,LOELI12,2012-09-06T20:18Z,Thank you; it works perfect !
,MCReaper,2012-09-07T05:53Z,"for those who get ""Make sure you can write to current directory""

I had the same problem, copy and paste XFORCE Keygen into the folder you installed the AUTODESK in, then open as admin from there and when you click Patch it should work.

hope this helps everyone :)"
,De-RaZZ,2012-09-13T12:01Z,"Thanks a lot Chris. Works fine.
is this the same as autocad 2013 for architecture edition?"
,De-RaZZ,2012-09-13T12:07Z,is this the same with AutoCAD 2013 Architecture edition?
,RedDog6,2012-09-16T19:49Z,The generated crack is 7 digits short...how is everyone getting around this?
,RedDog6,2012-09-16T19:59Z,"In case anyone runs into the same problem...once you get the successful patch message, it will activate with a crack that is 7 digits short. So even though it LOOKS wrong, it works. "
