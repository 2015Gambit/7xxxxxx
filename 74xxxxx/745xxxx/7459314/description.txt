Close Combat 3 the Russian front is a Real time strategy game covering the world war 2 conflict between Germany and Russia. The game is played from a top down perspective as if looking directly down from an aircraft over the battlefield. The Close Combat series of war games are a completely different animal to any other real time strategy titles. For example the Command and Conquer series bear no resemblence in looks or gameplay. The game takes an altogether slower more considered and realistic approach to the action. You do not just select a bundle of vehicles and troops and send them off guns blazing at the enemy. Also this is purely a wargame, there is no resource management involved in the game.
