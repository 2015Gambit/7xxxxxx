Brewer & Shipley mean nothing in the UK and little more in the US having had only one hit over the pond in the early 70's ('One Toke Over The Line') however they did produce some excellent music in their time in a folk-rock / soft-rock vein. Their most renowned albums ('Weeds' & 'Tarkio') were reissued by the now defunct Collectors Choice Music a few years ago and I thought they made good listening with strong playing and superb harmonies but were occasionally let down by slightly weak, sentimental songwriting. It is therefore a pleasant surprise to see this reissue of B&S' '68 debut album from the estimable Now Sounds label and it turns out to be better listening than either of the B&S albums mentioned above with better songwriting (plenty of minor key folk-rock with occasional psych tinges) and playing from members of the legendary 'Wrecking Crew'. None of the songs are widely known apart from perhaps 'Keeper of The Keys' which was covered (well) by the psych combo; "H.P. Lovecraft" but all the songs are good to excellent with haunting melodies with arrangements primarily based around acoustic guitar (which they wisely stuck to throughout their career since this sound has aged well; think "Kings Of Convenience" and the like from the noughties).

In conclusion a very worthy reissue of some fine music and a welcome return to form from Now Sounds after their recent unwise detour into 'marshmallow-pop' by reissuing the first Harpers Bizarre albums which haven't dated nearly as well as the album reviewed here.
