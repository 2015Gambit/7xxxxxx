If you ever read Eragon and you are thinking about watching this for first time, I've got good news for you: You can go and download something else, it is totally fucked up, don't get your imagination raped. Borrow Paolini's book instead.


BTW: great upload as usual, good job YIFY. It's not you, its just the film "
