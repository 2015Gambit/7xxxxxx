Tested on Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit Acer Laptop 2GB Ram dual core(or above like i3,i5,i7 etc also is working).

**Fix**

2) Pls note **u must uninstall the old version driver & after it only install the new driver. While uninstalling old driver System restarts with VGA DRIVER(known as generic pnp driver) which is in-built. After it install the new driver

*How to uninstall old driver*

a) Device Manager>double click display adapters>double click Intel(R) HD Graphics>on driver tab > click uninstall

3) Install the new driver. System Restarts.Now game Amnesia The Horror Pc game works perfectly....

I thought i can never play the game now working fine also applied 1.2 Amnesia patch..... The drivers from frictionalgames.com dont work only from intel works
