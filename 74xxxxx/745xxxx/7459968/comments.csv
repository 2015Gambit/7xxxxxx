,afonsanho,2012-07-20T17:43Z,"great torrent. will seed 5x


off-topic:dejwbot , i have been asking this to a fair amount of uploaders, if you can, please upload crashtastic or detour, would be very cool since there arent any decent torrents for these games ^^."
,dejwbot,2012-07-23T17:35Z,"I'll probably won't be able to get Detour because of stupid Steam. I've been looking for Crashtastic for a long time and I can't find it anywhere so I guess that I'll have to buy it. However I cannot guarantee that I'll actually do it. Anyway, if I do I will seed :)"
