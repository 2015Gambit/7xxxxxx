All praise is due to Allah who filled with love and glorification the hearts of His beloved servants (Awliya), and removed from the hearts of others His recognition and appreciation.
I testify that there is no God worthy of worship except One, Allah, with whom I associate no partners. With love and reverence we worship Him, and in fear and longing we invoke His name. I testify that Muhammad is his servant, Prophet, His own beloved, best chosen and most trusted for His revelation, was sent down by Allah to save the human soul from self-indulgence and degradation, connecting it to the one who created the heavens and the earth. He was, by all means, a role model, and his message was a mercy and guidance for all mankind, giving them glad tidings and saving them from oppression. Peace and blessings be upon him.
