,Gman496,2012-07-19T17:46Z,Nice idea but users would want to seed if this is going to rock.....
,NYTDDS,2012-07-19T22:34Z,"Um I have been seeding. BHN came out today to turn my cable line from what some asshole in my aprtments split, back into a single line. So not only have I been seeding all day minus the down time to fix the line, but I always seed. Please for future record dont complain about no seeds on my torrents. I always seed fresh torrents until about 50 percent then I limit bandwidth a bit. So enjoy my seeding at maximum allowed."
,NYTDDS,2012-07-21T13:16Z,seeds will stop for a few hours. Trying to get the rest of some files for my new torrent. Will resume later today. Seed to each other if you can please.
,NYTDDS,2012-07-22T01:32Z,seeding is down. Bad storm. Saving bandwidth will reconvene tonight.
,Gman496,2012-07-23T17:37Z,"I wasn't referring to you DJThi ;)

You were kind enough to put this up here.

I was urging all who take it to seed for as long as they can because of its size & not just hit & run ;

Thanks for you efforts too DJThi :)"
,Rothaqul,2012-07-23T23:22Z,"still having bad weather?
missing about 8 Gb, and will seed as long as i can when done :D"
,Gman496,2012-07-25T10:23Z,No seeders at all now and stuck on 54%. What a waste....
,Juli1592,2012-07-25T21:02Z,Seed it!
,Gman496,2012-07-25T21:48Z,"@Juli1592

Doh! I've been seeding since I started. I was referring to the fact that nobody else is....."
,Rothaqul,2012-07-26T00:42Z,pls seed :D
,Juli1592,2012-07-26T02:07Z,"I will seed, but its stuck at 54%"
,Rothaqul,2012-07-26T07:29Z,same here :(
,Juli1592,2012-07-30T19:04Z,"Just a little more, common!"
,Gman496,2012-07-30T19:50Z,"@Juli1592,

Are you seeding Juli1592? I am but it still shows no seeders...............

Why do users go to the bother of uploading but not seeding out?"
,Juli1592,2012-07-30T20:04Z,"Im constantly seeding, Im at 93.8% 
And now its been standing still for some time"
,Gman496,2012-07-30T22:44Z,Obviously DJThi didn't wait until it was seeded out to at least one downloader before he stopped seeding himself?If that's the case nobody else will ever be able to finish it.
,holmbers1,2012-08-03T20:59Z,Is there no one seeding? Come on now please.
,NYTDDS,2012-08-04T01:27Z,"Go away for a few days to enjoy real life, come back and see nothing but complaining.....

Come on people have a little more faith than that."
,NYTDDS,2012-08-08T22:20Z,I don't want hear anymore trash about me not seeding. My utorrent and this page says there is PLENTY of seeders.
,NYTDDS,2012-08-15T13:21Z,"apparently, season 5 is either not complete (with episode 52 being the last one to season 5)  or Season5Ep52 is the sixth season starter. According to itunes, there is 51 episodes in S5.

According to Wikiipedia, there is a bunch more episodes. But knowning this show to heart, it seems S5E52 might be S06E01 since itunes hasnt updated the season 5 list yet (only 51 episodes still)

So Im pretty sure 52 is 6-01. Just putting my two cents in before everyone acts like brats going not complete blah blah blah."
,bragazar1710,2012-08-16T03:42Z,thanks.
,NYTDDS,2012-08-26T20:14Z,"apparently 5 is not complete, rather took a month+ break."
