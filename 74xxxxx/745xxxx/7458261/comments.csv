,bossssk,2012-07-23T12:59Z,".BONE. I have a question and hopefully you can answer it. If I were times download a movie torrent to my android device,  would I be able to watch it after I downloaded the torrent or would u have to use my computer to transfer the file. Btw I am using a Samsung Galaxy S 3. If anyone else can answer my question please hello!"
,Abeloth,2012-07-25T22:30Z,You should be able to access the file straight from your phone.  I have a similar phone and I download things all the time from here to it.  The only issue you might have is not having a video player that can play the format of the file so you would need to download a better player than the stock one.  I suggest MX player... its really good about playing most anything on an android device.
