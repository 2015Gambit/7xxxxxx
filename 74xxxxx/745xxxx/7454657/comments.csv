when final version will release ?"
,GlxySwft,2012-08-10T20:12Z,"Works just fine. I'm assuming this is the same as the trial versions from the Microsoft website, and will stop working once Office 2013 is actually released, right?"
,ra1eigh,2012-08-25T04:52Z,It works. You have to uninstall all Microsoft Office 32-bit software before you can run it.
