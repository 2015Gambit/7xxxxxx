         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Episode  Summary      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The crew are captured by Water-Thieves, a feral tribe. Sinbad tries to seduce 
their fierce leader Razia to save himself, but despite satisfying her, he learns
she will kill him that night. Sinbad escapes with the help of RaziaΓÇÖs chained 
Roc, a giant mythical bird, and creates a diversion allowing his friends to 
escape. Sinbad returns to RaziaΓÇÖs chamber and frees the Roc, but Razia attacks 
him. As his curse kicks in and is about to destroy him, the Roc swoops in and 
rescues Sinbad.

TasteTV`s 404p .mp4 has what here we call "descriptive video" in place of the 
normal audio track. 
err0001`s 352p .avi is an analogue rip of an HD channel.
This comes from an HD WEB-DL that most groups so far haven't found.
