Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, July 17 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Mike Adams talks with patriot movement icon G. Edward Griffin. Mr. Griffin is the author of the classic and essential primer on the Federal Reserve cartel, The Creature from Jekyll Island. He is the author of a number of other books and has produced several films, including What in the World Are They Spraying? The Chemtrail/Geo-Engineering Coverup. 

Mike also talks with Blair Hamrick, a big pharm whistleblower who has blown the lid off the bribery of physicians, the push for off-label marketing of drugs for unapproved health conditions, and the illegal marketing of drugs to children by GlaxoSmithKline.
