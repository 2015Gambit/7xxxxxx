,Doug1986,2012-07-19T01:08Z,Seriously is it sooooo hard to do these in .avi?
,xpmule,2012-07-19T06:30Z,"@Doug
Releases have to be x264 + .mp4 (container)

Bottom line is the scene groups can NOT release .avi's they are not allowed according the rules, if they do it will get nuked..

Kinda like how THIS release got nuked..
reason ? ""missing footage get repack""
its on TPB just search for it ;)"
