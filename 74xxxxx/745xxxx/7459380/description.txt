If you only want one FNM bootleg in your life this is the one to collect !!

Soundquality is GREAT. This is my personal feeling. And I was there.
Maybe Im not the right one to say anything about this but this was GREAT !!!
All the way from the start to finnish it was tight and hard. And the audience was spot on.
Rare to see such a devoted audience. I knew it from the first cords of Be Aggressive
that this was a perfect evening. And then we got Surprise your dead and As The Worm Turns.
Happiest Man on earth after the gig. And when Mike Patton asked me after the gig what
was the best of the 2 London gig's all I could say was Ehhhhh......


To celebrate what happend a week ago in London
Here are the triumphant gig of Faith No more were
they played new song Matador for the first time in England!!!


What a night it was. Happy I could be there.


Hope you all will enjoy this nice little piece of music history.
