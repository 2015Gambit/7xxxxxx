[T],FatFreddy475,2012-07-19T22:00Z,I'm guessing this isn't the Ultimate Rekall Edition. which has 10 times better video quality? Or is this the poor 2006 release?
[T],FatFreddy475,2012-07-19T22:01Z,And enough of the rars already. They don't help and this isnt 1999.
[T],User_01,2012-07-20T14:03Z,"rars, 1999 ? What are you talking about exactly?

No rars and ""1999"" here (this torrent)!"
,XxSTICH666xX,2012-07-24T13:20Z,"I think he's saying in general. rars are annoying as all hell and if you don't have a connection with at least 10mbps download, then you have no business trying to torrent anything. "
,LEXX911,2012-07-26T05:59Z,I guessed this is not the new Mind-Bending Edition with the better video quality rescan right?
,wn143,2012-08-11T16:53Z,"I'm guessing that this is a BR Rip of the original release, not the July 2012 release referred to as the ""Mind Bending"" release or the ""Ultimate Rekall"" edition...  Can someone confirm ??"
,Lebada3,2012-08-12T08:15Z,This is the real thing. 2012 version is a classic hollywood remake garbage. 
,the_real_monroville,2012-08-12T20:28Z,"I recently purchased the MIND BENDING EDITION and, other than the extras, you may as well search for the Optimum UK blu 2008 release - color, black levels and overall PQ is MUCH better. "
