Plastic Beach (Japanese Import Edition)
Lossless M4A


Thought I would up this CD in a slightly more accessable file format, no conversion needed for your iPod! These are .m4a files converted from the Japan Edition of Plastic Beach that has been upped at least twice now on Demonoid since it popped up on another site. I also embedded the album art so this truly is an effortless addition to your library. Enjoy!
