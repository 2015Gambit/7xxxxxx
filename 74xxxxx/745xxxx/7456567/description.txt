The Reason Rally is a movement-wide event sponsored by the country's major secular organizations. The intent is to unify, energize, and embolden secular people nationwide, while dispelling the negative opinions held by so much of American society... and have a good time doing it!

Across America, in every city, every town, and every school, secularism is on the rise. Whether people call themselves atheists, agnostics, secular Humanists, or any of the other terms used to describe their god-free lifestyle, secularism is coming out of the closet.

On March 24, 2012, from 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM at the National Mall, nontheists from all corners of the globe descended on Washington, D.C. en masse to deliver the good news: "We're huge, we're everywhere, and we're growing."

Please note that the performances by Tim Minchin, Eddie Izzard, and Bad Religion were not included in on the DVD (presumably for contractual reasons, unknown at time of writing) and thus are not included here. Luckily, the internets provide: 	https://www.google.com/search?q=Tim+Minchin+reason+rally 	https://www.google.com/search?q=Eddie+Izzard+reason+rally 	https://www.google.com/search?q=Bad+Religion+reason+rally


Technical details: these are encoded from the official DVD source (same framerate & resolution).
Encoding process was to an MKV container with H.264 video and passthru AC3 audio.
This resulted in an excellent filesize (~12 MB/min) while being of indistinguishable quality from the original.


Can't play the video? Try these!
	On a Computer: Use VLC or MPlayer (any operating system)

	On an Android: The VLC Beta is perfect!
		If you can't find it on the app store (eg, North American users), try these:

 	http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/android-v7-tegra2/VLC-debug.apk

		As an alternate, MX Player works fine, but you may have to play with the software decoding options in the upper-right. For my device, I just needed to set Audio Track #1 (S/W) and it worked fine.

	On an iPhone: Mac users suggest GoodPlayer or AVPlayerHD.
