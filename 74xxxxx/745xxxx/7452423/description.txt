PS2 Emulator PCSX2 0.9.6 / Bios Included + Raiden III, Marvel Vs Capcom 2

This is probaly old news to some but i just figured this out last night and tested out these two games(pretty rare games i might add) i got a crappy stock 2.2ghz phenom cpu and am able to run these games fullspeed @ 60fps, other games like FFX which i'll show screens of below only run @ 60fps on my rig @ certain times. Now in order to run this emulator you should have @ least a dual core cpu with same as or higher ghz speed as mine stated above(3.0ghz and above will net you perfect playability on most compatible games-which is alot!) Single core cpu's will lag pretty bad as its made for dual core cpu's. I wont go into full detail on how to set this up as im new to this myself and had to find most of my info on google anyways..so google it up yo and youtube helps alot as well, there you'll find minimum and optimum requirements to run this bad boy 

 

Edit: When you open this up it will ask you to set bios and plugins (there included with this emulator already)  just browse to those locations to add the required files to run  also use linuz cdvd to load ur iso's other c dvd's dont load the games properly and only give u errors or black screens ( trust me i was messing with it for a while last night )
