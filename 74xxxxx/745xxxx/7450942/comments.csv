With so incredibly many great TV shows being canceled now days it feels sooo good to actually have a proper ending for this amazing show.

Thank you eureka for all the top notch entertainment you have given me these last years. I felt so happy when I watched the final minutes of this episode, but also really sad it was over. Ten seasons would have been great and I think they could, if they wanted to, keep the same quality of the show for ten hole seasons, but I guess I'll just have to be happy they kept the show going for almost the intended time and gave it the ending it deserved. Goodbye eureka and again, thank you.

The video quality of the download was pretty good,  it could of course have been better but for this size it's as I said, pretty good.

Thank you for an excellent UL as always eztv!"
