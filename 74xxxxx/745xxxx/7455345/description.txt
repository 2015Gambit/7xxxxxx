7-Zip is a free and open source file archiver. 7-Zip operates with the 7z archive format, but can read and write several other archive formats. The program can be used from a command line interface, graphical user interface, or with a window-based shell integration. 7-Zip began in 1999[1] and is actively developed by Igor Pavlov. The cross-platform version of the command line utility, p7zip, is also available.
