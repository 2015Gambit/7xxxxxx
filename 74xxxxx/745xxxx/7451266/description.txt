For over 15 Years from 1971 to 1986, The Old Grey Whistle test was the only Music TV Show in the United Kingdom that showcased Album tracks and so called 'serious' Music.

The BBC's excellent production values shine through in these unique recordings which have gone on to survive the test of time.   Music Lovers, enjoy in Vol 3 classic tracks from Argent, Joan Armatradings, Loggins & Messina, a very young looking Suzanne Vega as well as a classic cut of the Pattie Smiths Group's huge hit 'Because The Night'.
