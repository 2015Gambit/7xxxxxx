SIMON AND GARFUNKEL ΓÇô SONGS OF AMERICA 1969 
U.S. TV special. Nov-30-69. Controversial and rare TV show containing in-studio rehearsal and recording, road travel, political viewpoints, concert performances and video montages of key events of the 1960s. 

The program was originally to be a "Bell Telephone" TV special but when they saw the finished product they said, "No!" When video images of JFK, RFK and MLK were shown while "Bridge Over Troubled Waters" played, the Bell Telephone executives commented, "They're all democrats, why no republicans?" Simon & Garfunkel said, "Is that what you see? How about they were all assassinated?" Simon & Garfunkel met with CBS and they sympathized with the content and agreed to air the program. 

Songs include: "America," "So Long Frank Lloyd Wright," "Bridge Over Troubled Waters," "Scarborough Fair, " "El Condor Pasa (If I Could)," "Punky's Dilemma," "Mrs. Robinson," "Mystery Train," "Feeling Groovy," "The Boxer," "Homeward Bound," "Sounds Of Silence," and several others.
