Future of Forestry is a melodic ambient rock alternative band from Southern California. Eric Owyoung, lead singer and song writer, started the band Something Like Silas in 2000. After playing at Hume Lake for 3 years and planting Flood Church in San Diego, the band signed with Sparrow Records. In 2006 Something Like Silas changed to Future of Forestry and shifted into the Credential Recordings division of EMI. The name "Future of Forestry" is taken from a poem by famed British author C. S. Lewis entitled "The Future of Forestry". Starting in May 2009, the band started releasing the first of three EP's that are collectively known as the "Travel Series."
