[V],TorrentTracts,2012-07-18T20:26Z,"Ehdrummer, you're too kind.  I'll have some Clint Brown up for you in about 10 or minutes.  I think I've got about six or seven of his releases.  I'm not sure how many albums he has in total, but if I were to guess, I'd say he's probably got twice that many.  Hopefully I have something that will interest you."

I was wondering if you could do an apologetix discography? I love those guys."
