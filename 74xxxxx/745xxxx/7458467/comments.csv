,meisbored,2012-08-01T04:13Z,Where are episodes 7 and 8? Why does everyone suck at uploading this show?
,keanereader,2012-08-01T19:46Z,It airs right after Comedy Bang Bang on the same channel and that's still getting uploaded... WTF?
,Abductor,2012-08-04T04:18Z,"hey scene balance thanks for these, but FYI every episode is out of sync by about 20 frames."
,keanereader,2012-08-04T20:04Z,Three episodes out after this one... at least give us an excuse?
,ndim22,2012-08-05T00:21Z,"I can't find the 3 most recent episodes anywhere. If anybody knows where to find them, please post the info here. You can watch ep. 7 on IFC.com for now anyway."

Are you sure it was episode 7 on the IFC website? The only one I can see is episode 8. Thanks for letting us know though!"
,ndim22,2012-08-09T01:14Z,It Was. I guess they only have one full episode at a time.
