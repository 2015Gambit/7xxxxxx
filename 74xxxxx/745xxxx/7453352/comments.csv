Thanks."

thank you for uploading such timeless film collection "
,serena101,2012-07-21T14:05Z,"auge:

do you have Strawberry Blonde (1941)? I've been looking for a comedy dvd version of that for such a long time"
,El_Hanko,2012-07-24T00:10Z,"Thank you very much Auge, you're definitely my favorite uploader on thepiratebay :)
I actually haven't seen a complete movie by Lloyd, just scenes taken from some of his most famous films. I've been reading about him at imdb.com and some of these movies seem pretty funny :D so I will check them out :)
Once again, THANK YOU :)

@insinuendo 'Safety First'. You mean ""Safety last"", right? or is there another movie called ""Safety first""? :)"
,baybeh,2012-07-28T10:02Z,"Ok, practically no one wants to seed this. Yesterday there were about 40 leechers and almost none of them are seeding now.
Auge, I think, one of the reasons could be this: With big files, most folks probably just want to shift the files elsewhere so they won't take too much space in their computers. So is it possible for you to break down big files or collections into smaller upload chunks? People might choose to seed longer. (Maybe.) I might even be completely wrong, of course. Maybe people are being selfish because that's what they are. Leeching off and disappearing, because that's all they know."
,El_Hanko,2012-07-29T01:35Z,"Hey baybeh, I only downloaded the first DVD 'cause I wanted to check it out first (My hard drive is completely full right now :D and I'm burning to DVD like a maniac), but now that I read your comment I stopped all of my other torrents that were seeding to maybe help a bit with the seeding if I can.


By the way, could anyone PLEASE re-seed ""Sanjuro"", I downloaded that torrent about 2 weeks ago and I'm at 11.8 % and shows 0 seeds.
Thank you :)"
,El_Hanko,2012-07-29T02:09Z,"Oh! I just thought of something: ""Yesterday there were about 40 leechers and almost none of them are seeding now."" do you mean they don't show up as ""seeds"" on your torrent client? (there's 11 ""seeds"" right now according to DHT, by the way). IF that's the case, then maybe it's people who just downloaded part of it, like I did. Maybe they're still there, but don't show up as ""seeds"". That might be it, because I see people at 0.5% (and others with a somewhat higher % that probably haven't downloaded the first DVD completely) and they're only downloading from me at about 3 kB/s or not at all. So they're downloading from other people. I can upload at about 220 kB/s and have full connectivity."
,baybeh,2012-07-29T07:15Z,"Hi El_Hanko, right now it's showing 7 seeders, but throughout the past week it's shown only 0 seeds. Anyway, thanks for helping with the seeding."
,baybeh,2012-07-29T07:59Z,"Also, I haven't downloaded Sanjuro, otherwise I would have seeded it. But I have a similar problem with Sansho the Bailiff. If anyone can reseed then please help."
,El_Hanko,2012-07-29T13:02Z,"Ah, I see. 
Oh, that's odd, brother. I've been seeding ""Sansho the bailiff"", but yeah, it says 0 ""seeds"", so I guess it's just me seeding. I just set the bandwidth allocation to ""high"" on u-torrent for that one, maybe that will help. Right now there's only one person downloading from me (very slowly, at about 12 kb/s), apparently from India, is that you baybeh? :)"
,baybeh,2012-07-29T14:15Z,"El_Hanko: yep, that would be me! Thanks so much for seeding :)"
[T],Auge,2012-07-29T19:21Z,"Fellas, I no longer have those torrents.
But I am considering remaking them to be shared at demonoid; they won’t be the same so you will need to re-download . . . but the new ones will be seeded better."
,El_Hanko,2012-07-30T01:37Z,"I see, thanks Auge :)

No problem baybeh! :)
Don't worry guys, I will continue to seed ""Sansho The Bailiff"" until a few people more are seeding :)"
,El_Hanko,2012-07-30T06:57Z,"Auge, when you have time, could you please upload ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang""?. I love that movie.

THANK YOU"
,serena101,2012-07-30T08:50Z,"auge:

do you happen to have ""Taxi"" 1932? i think it was cagney on the lead role"
,baybeh,2012-07-31T15:26Z,"El_Hanko: Thanks. I'll be seeding Sansho the Bailiff now. 

Auge: Looking forward to your Demonoid uploads. Let's just hope Demonoid gets back up on its feet!"
,baybeh,2012-07-31T15:28Z,"Also, I watched Harold Lloyd's 'Safety Last'. Amazing. It was probably for the first time that I was panicking for the guy and laughing at him at the same time! And Mr Lloyd sure had cojones to perform the kind of stunts he did."
[T],Auge,2012-07-31T18:41Z,"baybeh
A couple weeks ago I watched a 13 part documentary called Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film. There was a section on Lloyd and it showed how he did the stunts . . . he wasn’t really dangling in space like that, he built a fake wall on top of a roof and situated the camera to make it look real."
,baybeh,2012-08-01T04:15Z,"Auge: Yeah, they said that in the commentary of the film too, that it was a fake wall with grooves in it to fit his hands in, but apparently it was still as high as the original building would have been. So all the places where he's teetering off the ledge still required risk. (Of course there was a stunt double for some shots and mattresses for protection too)."
,serena101,2012-08-01T08:21Z,"auge:

can you upload:The Man with Bogart's Face - 1980 starring: Robert Sacchi? its a good film. I have been looking for it for a long time"

,baybeh,2012-08-07T11:50Z,"El_Hanko, Auge: That's terrible news."
,baybeh,2012-08-07T11:54Z,"In case anyone's interested (and if you've still not seen it), here's part of Sight & Sound magazine's once-in-a-decade poll - The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time

,El_Hanko,2012-08-07T18:00Z,"baybeh: I saw it coming man, that's why I registered here. But yeah, another gone... too bad.

Hehe I saw the list at Ebert's site a few days ago http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2012/08/a_few_calm_words_about_the_lis.html
After reading the complete list all I can think of is what he commented: ""But let's remember that all movie lists, even this most-respected one, are ultimately meaningless."" :D"
,serena101,2012-08-19T17:14Z,"auge: can you find ""Westfront 1918"" - 1930?
im trying to look for that film for a long time in dvd XD"
,baybeh,2012-08-23T17:52Z,"Hey Auge, long time no see. All well, I hope."
,baybeh,2012-08-26T10:21Z,"In case anyone's interested, here's a Sight & Sound magazine poll update: The Top 250 films of all time 
http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics/ 
Auge has put up several of these already... which leads to the question: Where are you Auge?"
[T],Auge,2012-08-27T20:15Z,"Beybey,
I love that you talk about Sight & Sound information on my posts, which is telling me that I am doing good work and attracting the right folks.
I have a subscription to the magazine and recommend it to anybody interested in film that wants to know more about art film and foreign films . . . they have great articles and reviews.

Anyway, my hiatus from uploading has a couple reasons the first is I started Project Management courses to enable me to move into QA manager rolls in software testing. I have been in software for a while and it is time to advance up the ladder.

The other reason is a selfish one, I am not getting much out of uploading as  Pirate bay has very limited full DVDs on offer, at least when demonoid was up I could bounce back and forth.
It is getting extremely difficult for me to fill holes in my collection from these public trackers.
It would be great if someone invited me to a private tracker, then I would be more motivated to be as active as I once was."
,appscience113,2012-08-28T01:10Z,I have an invite to a private tracker if you are interested Auge but I'm not to big on just posting it out here in the open.
[T],Auge,2012-08-28T02:44Z,"Please send the information to me at this email; it’s an email I use when I don’t want to hand out my real email.

,baybeh,2012-08-28T07:49Z,"Auge, I love Sight & Sound magazine myself, and yes, you're doing excellent work here :)

Demonoid's being taken down was always upsetting but please don't stop uploading because of it! :)"
