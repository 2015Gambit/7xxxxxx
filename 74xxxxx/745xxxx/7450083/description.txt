From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, July 16 edition of the Alex Jones Show, guest host Mike Adams talks with former newspaper journalist and New York Times best-selling author Jim Marrs. Jim and Mike talk about the United Nations' gun-grabber internationalist treaty and other topics of pertinence. Jim's latest book is The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy: How the New World Order, Man-Made Diseases, and Zombie Banks Are Destroying America. 

Mike also talks with Darrell Rogers, the Communications Director for the Alliance for Natural Health-USA, an organization dedicated to promoting sustainable health and freedom of choice in healthcare through good science and good law. 

In the third hour of today's show, we feature an in-depth "Ask Alex" segment covering the UN treaty and immunity for Monsanto.
