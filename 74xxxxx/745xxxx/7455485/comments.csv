i'm a huge fan of this program and when there is an update i just go and get the installer from scooter software and it will upgrade your install. And the previous key always seems to work so the previous CORE keygen i used STILL works (just tested it)

so yoou can always get this build and future updates from.

i would advise disabling auto updates to just to be safe even though i think it works fine.

I think this is among the the top 10 programs i would say is worth buying.
And you have to have respect for a company that focuses on making a quality product rather than anti-piracay BS.

and even though i like UltraEdit i don't like UltraCompare lol

as always i hope my comments will be helpful to those that don't know etc
if not please ignore me ;)"
