Hello, Hello, Hello everyone!
You may Have noticed my soundtracks from another game of Edmun McMillen, The Binding Of Isaac. Well, this is another similar soundtrack, from the same game publishing company, and the same composer, Danny Baranowski.
We've got heavy beats, a bit of techno rock, similar to Binding, with some humour chucked in.

Support the developers- if you like the soundtrack, try out the game for $15 on Steam, currently 75% off for steam summer sales, a worthy purchase.

I haven't listed them as I usually do, as there is 70 tracks. 

OH, AND YES, THERE'S 70+ TRACKS! (79)


Hope You enjoy, if so, it's a small file so a little seeding won't hurt anyone ;)

Enjoy and stay tuned for more like it!

Tedias.

PS, if it doesn't work/ doesn't have all files, it means i've uploaded wrong, so let me know and ill fix and get back to ya1 ;)
