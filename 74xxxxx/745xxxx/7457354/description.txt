Praise for the author:

''In his depiction of 16th-century Asia, Alex Rutherford has set the bar high for his sequels' Daily Mail

----------------------------

ΓÇÿA totally absorbing narrative filled with authentic historical characters and sweeping action set in an age of horrifying but magnificent savagery. The writing is as compelling as the events described and kept me eagerly leaping from one page to the nextΓÇÖ Wilbur Smith

----------------------------

ΓÇÿ[The] account of early Moghul emperors and the relationship between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal ΓÇª provides a thoroughly enjoyable romp in the haremsΓÇÖ Financial Times

----------------------------

ΓÇÿEvery page offers a vivid image or telling detail that captures the deeply weird and violent world of the Moghuls. WeΓÇÖre given internecine rivalry, the paranoia, poisonings, torturing and killings, flaying, blinding, knifing. Never have jewels, precious metals ΓÇª cascaded over the page as they do hereΓÇÖ Spectator

----------------------------

ΓÇÿA hugely entertaining book ΓÇª best of all is the potted history of the Moghuls, chock full of nuggets like how the ladies of the court used burnt conch shells and banana juice to remove unwanted hair ΓÇª Those Moghuls were high maintenanceΓÇÖ Guardian

----------------------------

ΓÇÿThis wonderful book sustains the suspense over four hundred pages ΓÇª some of the chapters read like extracts from a thriller ... The chapter describing the heroism of the Norwegian and British commandos in destroying the heavy water plant at Vemork is pure Alastair MacLeanΓÇÖ Sunday Telegraph
