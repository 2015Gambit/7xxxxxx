Guys Since nobody was loading it for windows m doin it.. its fast and works awsm.. follow d steps and alls good..

If u have an anti virus turn it off cause d keygen cmes as a trojan and its jst a keygen nthin else.. rename d mayday.ex to .exe and all s good..


1.) Start the program and go to registration dialog BEFORE running our keygen.
    If you get a popup warning message about suspicious program just ignore it.

2.) Close the keygen from background after you have inserted given details from it
    to program but BEFORE you accept them to avoid keygen detection.

3.) When you have succesfully registered the program please close and delete our
    keygen. If you don't do it the program will detect it and whine about. It's not
    an additional check or something we have forgot!

4.) Do not even think about renaming included .exe to keygen.exe. All you get
    then are invalid serials.

if u have ny issues lemme kw ... 

Cheers!!!
