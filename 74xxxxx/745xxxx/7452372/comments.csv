Auto Eye 2 and Mystical 2 works in Photoshop CS6(32 bit only), and CS5 (both 32 and 64 bit) 

DreamSuite Ulitmare does not work. ""Invalid serial number""

Do you have other serials or crack for dreamsuite ultimate.

i have windows 7 64 bit by the way. "
,goliretor,2012-07-21T11:42Z,"I will try to locate and lay out, but nothing promising"
,BIGboyman,2012-07-23T19:06Z,"auto eye - ok
mystical suite - ok
dreamsuite ulitmate - ok
photographic edges - ok



hi goliretor, all were installed and registered. 

the key is not to go online when installing the programs. (VERY IMPORTANT)

second, go offline when using the program.

because if you are connected to the internet and you open the program, the serials will be deactivated automatically and will be invalid.

note: for the working serials, i used the filename ""auto fx software purchases.pdf"""
,BIGboyman,2012-07-23T19:12Z,"PLEASE MAKE SURE TO DO THIS AFTER INSTALLING THE PROGRAM. (MAKE SURE YOU ARE OFFLINE WHEN DOING THIS).

Additional way > blocking the plug on Internet access to check the serial number. We go at C:/Windows/system32/drivers/etc and open hosts file with notepad and appends to the bottom:
""127.0.0.1 autofx.com""
""127.0.0.1 www.autofx.com"" > without """""
