Including : Genkibowl, And The Trouble With The Clones And The Rest ?

Please Answer."
,Dz3us4s,2012-07-19T12:25Z,"More importantly can you save with it, cuz I couldn't with others"
[T],aviara,2012-07-19T13:00Z,"The game can be saved, the other dlc`s will come soon, you could play it in co-op with tunngle"
,Jamfn,2012-07-20T00:22Z,"@Aviara 

Steam already made a pack of the game and all the dlc's for like 50 dollars. Since they did that, I'm still in a way shocked that even now the full dlc pack isn't released on here yet or atleast the remaining dlc's to be put into the skidrow release or this one.(just my opinion)"
,whatthefuckpassword,2012-07-26T05:44Z,What does this release do that the Skidrow release does not do?
,fragsnipa,2012-07-26T08:02Z,Thnx aviara please add the dlc.  Im suprise no one release the dlc on here yet.  I guess this game wasn't popular enough.
,Shane_oNeil,2012-08-07T12:58Z,is any way to play this game online or something like that?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
,Shane_oNeil,2012-08-07T13:16Z,it says on tunngle: network cable was disconnect... :( what i have to do?
