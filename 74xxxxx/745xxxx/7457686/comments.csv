,cybermurf01,2012-07-26T15:37Z,download speed for the is was excellent BUT I have now downloaded this torrent 3 times and CAN NOT BE PLAYED.  THE VIDEO DOES NOT WORK.  as far as i can tell something went wrong with the original encoding and the up loader did not test play them before he uploaded.  
,cybermurf01,2012-07-26T21:08Z,"is anyone else having problems playing the vids? i am cybermurf@aol.com.  i think they were badly ripped because i cant even convert them to something else like .mov or .avi. 
i am dying to see these now. anyone have some feedback?"
[V],dohduhdah,2012-07-26T23:38Z,"No idea what the problem is. They play back fine for me, both in VLC Media Player and in BS Player Pro. Perhaps you can try to download and install the K-Lite codec pack."
,cybermurf01,2012-07-27T02:20Z,i have k-lite (it rocks).  i tried using quicktime (it doesn't rock) and it still didn't work.  guess i will try vlc or try downloading them from a different computer.   by the way.. thanks for the all the up loads you have quite a good list of things. 
,cybermurf01,2012-07-27T04:05Z,ok... i owe you an apology. i downloaded it to a different machine and it works fine. something must not have completed in the downloading on the other machine. i am truly sorry.  thanks for your help and thanks again for the great upoads
