Note: Ok we were kindly given a mpeg file which had a small res 352x ...and were
asked to see what we could do First off got to sat video is better than the old
source but has alot of faults ...some which can't be fixed Video in parts is
cammed in 3D,plus auto focus issues and missing video ...a few bit aswell

Well what we did was played the old russian release side by side which this one
and everytime we found missing video we cut the frames and saved.Then we took the
mpeg file and encoded that ..gave it some lovin Then we needed too re-encode the
old russian parts we had too match the stats of this new encode and then append
where needd From there is was onto the audio ....took the erv file that was
upped and resyncd it,then cleaned and filtered it

Got to be honest and say ...the 3d and auto focus wreck what could have been a
good cam copy You have been warned about the issues so i can't do no more than]
that 

P.s SCREENSHOTS WILL ALWAYS LOOK BETTER SO DON'T GO BY THEM
( same goes on anyones release ....always check sample instead )
