A: 6

The main issue is that in wide-shots the 3D is clearly present (double-image, blurry).  I'd say about 3/8 to 1/2 of the film is in that 3D annoying format.  It's not too distracting though.  At least for me.

As the description says they tried their best.  And for their efforts they did a descent job with what they had.

Overall, it's worth the dload.  I fully expect this film itself to suck (blood, that is) >:E"

,daco1xxl,2012-07-18T17:27Z,"Its a newer shitty source! Thanks for trying I guess. But this copy is just as shitty as the last ones! The spiderman man copy with bad audio was worth watching more than this! Another one of the shitload of bullshitted uploads keeping pirate bay full as ever! When will this shit end with people reposting shitty uploads over and over??? The title speaks for itself, FUTILE!"
,pzxzxz,2012-07-22T05:50Z,how about just writing the v/a for the movie and keep you freaking smart ass remarks to yourselves...

,iLirian,2012-07-28T01:40Z,Not bad. Ive seen better cams but this is definitely watchable.
,pzxzxz,2012-07-28T05:33Z,"I wrote my previous comment after skimming through the movie.  Just watched the whole thing, and the 3D throws it off quite a bit.
A-6
V-5
Uploaders, I appreciate everyone's work, but please do not record cams from 3D theaters..."
