,wutang47,2012-08-03T10:59Z,"Btw, quality is good as uploader had stated (for first time viewers, quality is intentionally shitty like in those public access shows). Good quality, tiny files, I love it!"

,EnemyDrone,2012-08-13T13:08Z,Stupid fucking mkv files
,somalibay,2012-08-14T14:40Z,"why not mkv?
matroska is free, open standard and very versatile.
what's not to like?"
,bongripper,2012-08-18T06:47Z,"PLEASE! If you have the last 2 episodes, can you upload them?

The only place I was finding eps was on Demonoid, and well we all know what happened there."

First, thanks.

Second to answer your question;

Xvid is free too.

Xvid is also open source. Though being open source is of no importance to end users who are just recording/play media.

Xvid is also versatile in as much as it does everything it needs to do. Quite frankly, the so called versatility of MKV is over rated and unwanted by many as it creates more problems than it solves.

The biggest issue is MKV's incompatibility with a lot of player apps and a lot of stand alone players that can't handle the format at all. Believe it or not, most of us don't appreciate being locked into having to use VLC on a PC to watch the content or having to recode the media into something useable. 

MKV brings nothing to the table except a slew of annoyances and compatibility issues. 

If anyone builds a time machine the first thing that needs to do is go back to 2002 and destroy the project before it ever comes to be."
