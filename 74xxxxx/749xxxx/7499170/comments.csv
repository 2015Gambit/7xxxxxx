,ChasUGC,2012-08-03T05:33Z,"Somebody needs to update the seeders and peers or something. It's showing 0 seeders-0 peers here, but in Bittorrent its showing 58 seeders and 743 peers. Weird, but the download is fast. I just hope its not fake. Doesn't feel like its fake. I still like the bobbies whether they're fake or not. {Woof}"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-03T05:42Z,"you're welcome, guyz! Drean Team is back!!!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-03T10:38Z,"@ChasUGC: Have a little faith, dude! You think that I have a green skull for nothing? Ask everyone if I have ever put a single fake torrent, or read all the comments of all my torrents!"
,bogspeedo,2012-08-03T10:53Z,how come there are no seeders. download is down to single digit. thanks for the up Nepotu.
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-03T13:04Z,I don't know. I think that is a TPB problem. You're welcome!
,BoredRor,2012-08-03T16:14Z,fake shit
,ChasUGC,2012-08-03T16:30Z,"Dude, I think you should the videos. The second quarter and the fourth quarter quit about half way through. You can't even see the end of the game."
,ChasUGC,2012-08-03T16:33Z,These videos are defective. Someone else please check the second and fourth quarters.
,russxi,2012-08-03T17:06Z,"dislike, 2nd to 4th quarter quits about after 1/4 running time"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-03T18:01Z,I guess you have right guys! It's something defective with the 2nd and 4th quarters. I'll try to give you a solution. Please wait!
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-03T19:05Z,"I'm affraid that is nothing I can do to fix this. Is the ripper's fault. All I can recomand you is download the 720p version from here (courtesy of NBC Sports Network from USA): http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7499960/London.2012.Basketball.M.Gr.A.(02_aug).USA.vs.Nigeria.720p60fps
A big SORRY to all of you!!!"
,ChasUGC,2012-08-03T20:17Z,"Please remove the torrent, it is defective."
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-03T22:34Z,"I know that 2nd and 4th Q are defective, I have told you, and I have ask you to forgive me for that error (the ripper's error). I can't remove it. It don't let me. Also, I gave you a solution. What else you want me to do? Commit suicide for this torrent? I'd tried to bring to you this game as fast as I could. ChasUGC and BoredRor, you are useless."
,ChasUGC,2012-08-04T01:13Z,"Dude, I appreciate the effort. We all appreciate the efforts of the uploaders. I was just trying to give a solution to the problem. If it wasn't a possible solution you could have said that, instead of insulting me. No suicide is necessary, its not that serious. Cheers mate."
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-04T02:28Z,"ChesUGC, I apologize! But I'm tired of people who comment without having any idea about they saying.  (like BoredRor, or even you when you said that this could be a fake from a green skull). I have never knowingly put something bad here. And if I did, I tried to fix it. Now, please, forgive me, bro, seriously, that I have insulting you. You seem to be a good guy though. My mistake. No one is perfect. Sorry, mate! Cheers!"
