Episode 9: Dirty Ol' Dad
Aviva's dad attempts to charm Sonja (and the rest of the 'Wives) in Miami.

Carole and Sonja head to sunny Miami to meet up with Aviva and Ramona. Aviva hosts a dinner for all the ladies, their husbands and her sex-addict dad, George. George immediately has eyes for all the ladies, including his "date," Sonja, and even tells Carole that he can do inappropriate things to her. Back in New York, Carole and LuAnn go shopping to look at some jewelry. Carole calls LuAnn out for asking her friend to loan her dresses. 

 On the last night in Miami, the ladies, their men and George head over to the Art Basel festival. Even though Sonja seems to have made it clear that sheΓÇÖs not interested, George is still trying. As the entertainment begins, Aviva pulls Sonja aside to ask how she deals with Ramona. The ladies return to the rest of the group and toast to a great Miami vacation.
