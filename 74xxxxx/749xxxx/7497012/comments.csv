I never thought I'd have trouble with VLC, but this is giving me no video. I know the video works because it plays on other players, but is really stilted and not smooth. Anyway, I'll figure out what the trouble is because I'm sure it's a easy fix. Thanks again for putting this game up!"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-06T20:14Z,Quarters 3 + 4 work fine. For some reason when I open either Q1 or Q2 in VLC it lists the length as 20 hours long and there's no video. Weird.
