 New Mexico

Andrew Zimmern comes to New Mexico where the frontier spirit can still be found, even when it comes to the food! Andrew goes out hunting buffalo on horseback and learns to roast prairie dogs with members of a Pueblo tribe, but he also meets modern day pioneers living inside futuristic homes that produce fresh ingredients for every meal. From fresh buffalo sliced buffalo heart, to menudo made the old fashioned way, to a matanza celebration featuring blood pudding and fried pig skin, Andrew explores the many layers of flavors from the past and present that can be found in this southwestern state!
