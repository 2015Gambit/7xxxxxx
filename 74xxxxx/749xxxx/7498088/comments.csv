,genuine12345,2012-08-02T21:31Z,"thnx tv-team. but I do have some complaints here. 

If you like some quality, you better not download this and wait another few days.

Quality SUCKS and looks more like f** up, pixelated telesync rather then a dvdrip.

Secondly, and this is for the releasers/creators of this pile of ** : At least put the effort in adding COMPLETE subs. After 30 minutes no more subs untill the second part. Nice one !
they could at least mention this. Instead we get incomplete sh** and they don't even bother to mention it."
,Revisionist,2012-08-02T23:49Z,"TVTeam used to be go to but now they seem to just post the same crap releases everyone else does.

And I havent seen actual specs for any titles from them in long time.  If I dont see specs I dont bother"
