ALMS American Le Mans Series race #3 - Laguna Seca Monterey - 12-May-2012

This is the 3rd race of the ALMS Series, held at the Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, 
in Monterey California. The AMERICAN LE MANS MONTEREY is a 6 hour timed event 
run over a 2.238 mile road course of 13 turns. Sixteen ALMS Prototype entries 
and 19 GT class contenders are scheduled to compete in 4 separate classes. This 
race was streamed live over the net from start to finish. Then the following day 
a shortened 2 hour version was broadcast in HiDef on TV. This download is an 
edited version of that broadcast.

This download is a .ISO file intended to be written directly to a blank 4.4GB 
DVD.  Then you can play it on your living room Blu-Ray console connected to 
your big screen HDTV. You can also play it on your computer DVD drive with 
appropriate software. The video is encoded in a hybrid format called BD5 that 
is compatible with all Blu-Ray console players but not likely any DVD consoles.

If you wish to play the download on your computer you can use a virtual DVD 
emulator utility, like the free DAEMONTools Lite, to "mount" the .ISO file as 
a temporary DVD drive. Then you can play the video directly using any Blu-Ray 
compatible media player. I often use the freely available DAPlayer. If you have 
the correct AVCHD CODECs installed then even Windows Media Player can be used.
