I keep telling  them that soon, it won't be necessary to go on holiday because we just hook up to a computer and it will give us the experience we ordered.  The holographic universe took it one step further.


I wrote Mr Davis an email last week and he answered the same day day. The topic of the email is not that important but his quick response was. It's a mine field for people who are looking for answers and don't believe in conventional religions There are too many people who are trying to take advantage of ""us"" who believe (and want to believe) in something less main stream... let's call it radical, and charge crazy amounts of money for ""the answer.""

Please people, don't fall for any of this. In the matrix, Neo didn't have to pay for the Red pill. If you hold ""the answer,"" why do you need money from the people you're trying to help. Does this mean only people with money can find/deserve the answer?

The truth: anyone who can deliver, what is being claimed by some, doesn't have to worry about money paid in advance. I gladly give all my earthly possessions to the person who can show me the way.

Sorry for my rant but I'm sick of these people who put price tags on other peoples happiness and lives. I'm downloading this episode  that I only expected on August 15th. WOW!

Mr Davis, thanks for your time, investment and effort. After watching the first 4 work shops a number of times, I'm feeling stuck and really hope to find the final piece of the puzzle in workshop 5

With respect!
