Description:
-----------------
This is a compilation of VALVE singleplayer-only games in the 
Half-Life universe, including:

	HALF-LIFE

The Idea behind this is to create an easy to handle "all-in-one" 
package and at the same time keep the filesize as small as possible. 
To achieve this I made use of the Source-Engine's shared GCF files. 
More information about this can be found in the 'FAQ' section.

Features:
---------------
- 	Amazingly small installer filesize.
- 	Uses unmodified files directly from STEAM, nothing was 
	changed from the original content.
- 	Incorporates newest updates to the SOURCE engine for all games,
	including achievements.
- 	International (English) release, can be expanded with other 
	languages.
- 	Precracked, no need for STEAM or internet connection.
- 	Custom installer/uninstaller with the option to select only 
	the games you want to install, each game can be installed as a
	standalone.

Instructions:
--------------------
- 	Run installer.
- 	Select the games you want to install.
- 	Launch games from any shortcut.

Latest Changelog:
-----------------
Version 1.30 (07/28/2012):

	standalone (more info in the FAQ section).

	- Added a toggleable slideshow.
	- Added a pause button during install (in case you need your 
	  CPU power elsewhere).
