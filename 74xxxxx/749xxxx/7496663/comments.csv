,DavidAMIs,2012-08-11T02:11Z,"So I've downloaded this torrent and installed Half Life, HF2, Ep1, Ep2, Lost Coast, and Portal. All of them work except for Half Life. When I try and start a new game it doesn't work. I have to press it twice and on the second try it just freezes saying that it's looking for a server. Any ideas?"
