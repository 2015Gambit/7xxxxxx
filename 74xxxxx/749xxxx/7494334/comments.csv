An invasive species of giant swamp rats are ravaging America’s Southern wetlands and are especially dangerous to the tenuous ecological system of the Mississippi delta region. This non-scripted series follows a pack of industrious guys dubbed the “Cajun Commandoes” in Louisiana who hunt these elusive 40-pound menaces both to sell and to eat. These determined rat hunters compete over a limited four month window to earn big bucks by capturing these loathsome pests for a bounty. (Source: Spike TV)
