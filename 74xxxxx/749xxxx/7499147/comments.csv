,JohnnyCab,2012-08-03T04:31Z,"Know this is a leaked version of the game, the Mane6 people are quite disappointed it even got leaked. Know they did have this to say about it: ""The unfinished version of Fighting is Magic is, needless to say, unsupported. We won't answer any questions relative to it, we won't give technical support to it, we won't discuss mechanics or graphic details from it, given its status as a leaked, unfinished, internal testing build, which happened to be leaked just right before a major update was pushed to our now closed QA test program.""

So this won't be supported or fixed, or updated, and they won't help you with it. More info @ http://www.mane6.com/"

Who cares what hey think? You think that the producers are happy that their movies, games etc. that cost them millions and millions of dollars are downloaded for free?

This game is fan-made and non-profitable. Enjoy"

In short, game won't start... halp."

,cmine,2012-08-08T22:10Z,"CoreXi7, you can switch players by changing the controls "
,cmine,2012-08-08T22:12Z,@Rustyiron you have to extract the files for it to stop doing that
