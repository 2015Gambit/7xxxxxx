Note: This is the new film from the director of The Blair Witch Project. Release
date is August 28th. I know someoen will re-encode this, make people's faces look
like they were painted on with crayon, and make the background have so much
digital noise that the video in motion is unwatchable, and THEN, them and
everyone else will pretend it's some amazing thing, when in reality it's
garbage, but in the meantime, enjoy a rip that represents the video as the
filmmakers wished it to be seen. 

AXED! We do this better!
