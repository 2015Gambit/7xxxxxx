Any suggestions to overcome the error. 
The updater does not seem to work."
,micriches,2012-08-23T01:07Z,"ill like to first of all say tht the issues you are having is Pc-Related not Software related. 

Your issue is common among xps when they are running high video demanding apps. The mst famous solution seems to be to update your video drivers.If your current driver is a bete one thn revert to proper build.

Concernng the updater-there's nothing wrong with it,maybe its nt working for the same reason the programme itself is nt running.Get the program to work thn close it and run it -thn lts see what happens"
