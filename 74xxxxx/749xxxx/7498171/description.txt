"Last summer, Bon Iver emerged from their rural Wisconsin recording studio and presented to the world an album of game changing importance. Blending americana, impeccable songwriting, and a tinge of 80's pastiche, Bon Iver, Bon Iver expanded upon the lonely, minimalist approach of For Emma, Forever Ago by a sonic magnitude of 10.

Bon Iver, Bon Iver: Stems Project is a call-to-arms remix contest, which is set to result in a complete fan-inspired recreation of the band's critically acclaimed and most recent album through the art of remixing. Sponsored exclusively by renowned music-streaming service, Spotify, Bon Iver has released all ten of the album's song's individual audio stems and is hosting a remix contest for each right here on Indaba Music. The best remix for each song will be selected by Bon Iver constituents in the end, assembled as a complete album and released exclusively on Spotify for the world to hear."
