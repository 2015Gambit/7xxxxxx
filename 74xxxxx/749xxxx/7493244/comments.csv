,Pryor06,2012-08-23T21:52Z,"Mine was working until now. After successfully registering using the keygen the first time last month, I suddenly got the ""...registration code has exceeded the limitation"" tonight. 

Keygen no longer works for me. I get ""Improper registration code"". I think they're using the same keygen for the different versions of Wondershare here. 

From what I've read from other users, After your registration pulls through, you should start blocking WSHELPER.exe because it the one which detects if you have an original copy.

Is there a workaround for users like me? another keygen perhaps?"
,yokrysty,2012-08-23T23:54Z,"if you want to block wondershare software from accessing the internet
add these lines to the hosts file at C:WindowsSystem32driversetc:
127.0.0.1 support.wondershare.net
127.0.0.1 www.wondershare.net
127.0.0.1 support.wondershare.com
127.0.0.1 www.wondershare.com"
,vikram1,2012-08-31T21:45Z,Great! Senzati. Thanks alot. Thanks also to yokrysty about editing hosts file. 
,vikram1,2012-09-01T22:38Z,"Update. Edited the hosts file but Still got msg that registration code excceded the limitation. 
Any sugestions?"
,jk1956,2012-09-18T15:09Z,"The easiest way to handle registration problems is to: 
1. Install program
2. Disable net connection.
3. Open program and register using keygen.
4. Shut down program.
5. Delete file C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesWondershareWondershare Helper CompactWSHelper.exe (win 7 64).
Now you can stay connected in the internet when using the program. Win 7 32 the path to the file is propably: C:Program FilesCommon FilesWondershareWondershare Helper CompactWSHelper.exe"
