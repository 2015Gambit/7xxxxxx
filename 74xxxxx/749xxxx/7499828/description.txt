Three young people - a woman and two men - roam in the overwhelming nature, through the forests and over sloping green hills. The trio investigates their mutual relationships and sexual predilections, encouraged by the ubiquitous elements. The protagonists don't talk a lot, the emotions expressed say enough. Occasionally playful, then serious, they experience the fiery elements and each other.
The video function of a digital photo camera, extra sound recordings on a laptop: these are the only instruments that the Greek director Frantzis uses to tell his existential fairytale. The result is unpolished, very colourful and is reminiscent of Super8 films. Close to the skin, the result is very sharp, from a distance it is out of focus or coarsely grained. Raw and even shocking. In the background, we hear amplified natural sounds of rushing wind and flowing water. With little additional music, apart from an occasional number by Joy Division. This artistic film makes our Dionysian roots tangible.
