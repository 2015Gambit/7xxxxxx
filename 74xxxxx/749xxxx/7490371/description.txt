Map Pack for Counter-Strike 1.6 by VHS
----------------------------------------
Release: 7/31/2012


!!! This is not Counter-Strike 1.6 torrent, this is just map pack for the game.
!!! If you haven't downloaded the game itself, here's the torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7479063/Counter-Strike_1.6_%5Bno-Steam%5D_%5Bv44%5D_%5Bp48%5D_%5B_bots%5D


First release of VHS Map Pack. It has over 600 maps.
Install Map Pack by extracting it to your Counter-Strike 1.6 folder using self extractor.
* note: You can extract it anywhere but than you need to copy those files manually.

Second part of the torrent is optional. It's VHS Graphis User Interface for Counter-Strike 1.6.
It replaces default menu and menu graphics, adds few useful key bindings and replaces intro song.
Installation is same as Map Pack Installation (locate Counter-Strike 1.6 Folder).
* note: If you've already installed VHS Counter-Strike 1.6 you don't need to install this GUI.
