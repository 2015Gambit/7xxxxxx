,dqxslime,2012-08-04T17:30Z,"This torrent is 100% certified FAKE, folks. Don't waste your time downloading this garbage. There is no valid Wii format game disc image contained in the RAR."
,muvlikemagic,2012-08-05T03:48Z,is multiplayer working guys???
,gazmeist,2012-08-05T04:01Z,"Confirmed rubbish - Ive extracted the rar and attempted to rename to iso, wbfs, rar to extract again. Nothing works its crap don't waste your bandwidth"
,LinkSoul,2012-08-05T17:53Z,Guys this is a load bull don't download it
,weise81,2012-08-06T03:14Z,"The problem is with the new IOS59 implemented in the game. Even people with original copies are struggling to make backup copies with wbfs. Just wait till they release a cios59.

Although even if the game becomes playable with cios, you need to setup a VPN to play online outside of Japan as well and pay to play after you reach the end of the offline portion of the game."
,bunnineeds,2012-08-06T14:46Z,"works great, just follow instructions"
,LinkSoul,2012-08-07T00:04Z,what instruction and source it
,weise81,2012-08-07T01:05Z,"Found this on another site, if it helps.

1. Hard Modded Japanese wii or wii regioned to japanese(not to sure on this one though as i used a japanese wii)

2. Usb loaders will not work and most likely never work as you cant switch disks on the fly with a usb loader loading from usb.

3. you need a registration code to even complete the installation

4. The game has an IP block you will need to make a VPN 

5. japanese wii points card (little hint though you can use the buddy system to get a free 500 points for connecting to wifi)

6. 16GB flash drive seperate from your wii hdd cause it has to format the drive to a special format.

7. Installing the game will create a DQ10 channel which is used from there on to load the game instead of using the disks.

And you need the latest ios59 ripped from the game disk or using the update that comes with the game to install it or else the game wont load at all."
,LinkSoul,2012-08-07T05:09Z,thanks for the info but all that's missing is the ISO this one is useless

,br1ng1t0nh0,2012-08-26T18:56Z,"works great, just follow instructions"
,radicaldreamer,2012-09-01T08:22Z,"This is a 9GB dummy file.  (All 0's from top to bottom if you open in a hex editor)  No way this game will work, regardless of what instructions you follow to run it."
