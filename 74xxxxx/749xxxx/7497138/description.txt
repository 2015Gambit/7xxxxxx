Title: Empire of the Ants
Genre: RTS / top-down / ecology
Released: 20th April 2000
Developer: Microids
Publisher: Strategy First
Description:
Based on the book of the same name by Bernard Werber, this unusual game from Microids challenges players to feed their workers, expand their colony, and protect the queen at all costs. Though perhaps borrowing slightly from Maxis' 1991 SimAnt in theme and setting, Empire of the Ants offers state-of-the-art real-time strategy gaming in a whole new arena. Players battle for control of 3D-rendered landscapes featuring enormous mushrooms and towering blades of grass. While seasoned real-time strategy gamers should recognize the conventional themes of resource management and military expansion, Empire of the Ants interprets these concepts on its own terms.

How to play:
1) Burn Ants.cue to a disc or mount it on a virtual drive;
2) Start Launch.exe to install the game (it will open automatically if you have autorun enabled);
3) Run Patch_161.exe to patch the game;
4) Play the game with the disc inserted.

! Warning
The game gives many errors on Windows 7 and crashes after a short while. Use an older version of Windows to play the game normally.
