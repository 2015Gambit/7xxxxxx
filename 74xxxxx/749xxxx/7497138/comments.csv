Would playing in compatibility mode make the game playable with Windows Seven ?"
[T],esharoth,2012-08-02T13:21Z,"I tried that, I played around with all the compatibility options, but it still didn't work. But it's still worth a try, maybe you'll have better luck."

,Mercury8215,2012-09-09T17:54Z,"Anyone can use older software with VMware Player.  VMware Player lets you install another operating system on your computer.  It's kind of like a virtual operating system.  You don't have to shutdown your computer and switch operating systems.  You can access it through your regular operating system as if it's just another program!  And VMware Player is free, at vmware.com

I won't get into the technical details about how to install and use VMware Player.  You can use Google to find that out.  Just a few tips though:  What you will need on top of VMware Player is, of course, another operating system.  Luckily, you can get any operating system here on The Pirate Bay.  It's probably best to use Windows XP Pro for this.  You won't need to install anti-virus software on it, even though it will keep reminding you that you haven't got any.  In fact don't even bother trying to connect to the internet through Windows XP, it can be a pain.  You can download any software you want to use through your regular operating system and transfer it to Windows XP.  (Again, us Google to find out how.)  If you've downloaded an activated version of Windows XP you can install the updates if you want.  

Have fun playing your retro games!"
