Run reg.bat the first time you play. it will reroute connection from crashtastic servers to local fake one.
Run start.bat to play the game. it will start the fake server.

If you like the game, buy it! Its a indie developer, so you wont be supporting any MAFIAA shit :)


DESCRIPTION:

So what exactly is Crashtastic you ask?
Well in a nutshell Crashtastic is a physics game where you build vehicles to help your robot test subject complete various objectives.

What platforms will this game ship on?
I currently only have plans to ship a PC and Mac version of the game.

When is going to be released?
I wish I could give a date, but the truth is I just donΓÇÖt know. I do plan on releasing a pre-order alpha in the near future however, so check back soon!

Who is making this game?
Just me. Yep, one guy, making a game. IΓÇÖve had some help in various areas, I purchased some art work (just the models), and had a bunch of help on the server side (Thanks Matt!), but IΓÇÖm the only one making the game.

So how does the game work?
You begin a level, and are shown the objective. You are then placed in an editor with robot sitting in a chair, and using various pieces, you build a vehicle around him. You can add wheels, braces, and shocks, and rockets as well. When you are ready to go, you hit the ΓÇ£GoΓÇ¥ button, and your vehicle will be placed in the level. You can then set how fast you want the rockets to go, and off you go!

Rockets?
Yep. Rockets! Rockets are actually required to make your vehicle move.

So can I steer this vehicle I created?
If the level allows it, you can add ΓÇ£Steerable WheelsΓÇ¥, which allow you to steer the vehicle.

What kind of Levels are there?
Objectives range from something as simple as reaching a specific speed or finishing in a given time. While the levels range include ramps, walls, and various obstacles you need to navigate. IΓÇÖm not done yet, but I expect there to be a good variety of levels.
