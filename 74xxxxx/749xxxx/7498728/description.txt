CoinDrop v1.3 By Headkaze
=========================

-= DESCRIPTION =-

This program will allow you to send coin drops to Mame from within your front-end. It runs in the background using a very small amount of CPU. When it detects a coin drop it will play a sound effect and store the amount of coins in memory. When you start Mame you can press the start keys and a credit is automatically registerd and starts the game. Dropping coins outside of Mame means you can carry over credits to multiple games.
