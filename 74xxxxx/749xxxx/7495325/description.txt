Mischievous Amit (Sharman Joshi) and shy Jai (Manish Nagpal) are two small town boys who come down to Mumbai for admission in Dhariwal College. To his credit, Amit ends up in a jam when he teases Neha (Raima Sen) and Nisha (Ria Sen) on the very first day of college and manages to drag poor Jai into this mess too. Three Bachelors - a story full of comedy, romance and confusion! It promises to make you laugh uncontrollably and will win your hearts!
