,Skittiks,2012-08-21T15:54Z,"First of all I would like to sincerely thank Nitot3 for uploading this fine torrent. 

For everyone who is interested in actually playing this game on a modern computer: I found 

a fix, and its working quite well right now.
As described in the torrent, the game runs VERY fast and was totally unplayable for me. 

To prevent the game from running too fast, a third-party FPS-limiter is required. 
A quick Google search referred to using desktop recording software with built-in fps 

limitation options. After testing a couple, a program called 'Dxtory' worked spot on.
It is free to try (YARRRR) and under the 'Advanced' tab (the 

tab looking like a circuit board) you will find the options for fine tuning your game 

experience. 
Turning 'Force CPU Processing' ON with a limited frame rate of 12-14 FPS made the game 

playable with my setup (i7-2600k, 16gb ram, 6970HD 2gb)

I hope this information helped anyone willing to play this classic :)

-Peace

PS: You can remove the FPS overlay in the second tab within Dxtory
PPS: Always seed torrents as rare as this one!"
