Hello dear Piratebay community.

This is my first and only upload ever, and since i remember enjoying this game
on earlier systems, i thought i'd share it with the rest of you, since i for one know this game is incredebly hard to come by. (Had to go through a spanish "fileshare" site, using google translate and downloading it as a 5 parter.

SIDENOTE/GAMEBREAKER: Now here's the sad part, since this game is fairly old, high-end PC's is not gonna be able to run this game well(from personal experience)

You might be able to launch the game, but the processor speed seems to be to high for the game, making it impossible to click normally.

You can however manage to click, but will have to do so VERY rappidly (tapping the left mouse button) This will have impact on the in-game experience, seing how you need to act fast at times.


However i did this for the sake of doing something good for others, and hopefully some 95/98 2000 Enthusiasts will have a ball.
