,antignor,2012-08-02T16:01Z,"It seems not to do anything at all this time: 0% available. Lots of peers, no seed.
I found it already somewhere else though. I tried several, at least one got me the pdf.. "
,sistromo,2012-08-02T17:30Z,Still not working for me. Is anyone seeding this?
,antignor,2012-08-02T18:30Z,"Do a search for this hash in google or something:

Book_Genie seems to have to sort out some problems.
Did you manage to upload torrents successfully before? Are you behind a router? Is your seeding port open and not set to 'random' in your client? Is your router configured to redirect that port to your computer? Do you have a fixed ip in your local network? In utorrent you've got this initial seeding option, do you use that (it may be better not to if lots of people pick and run)?

Those are some questions that might be in need of an answer before you can seed."
