Direct Folders Pro 3.71

Direct Folders guarantees you quick and direct access to your favorite and recent folders. Now you can jump to any deeply nested folder in just a single mouse click! It also automatically resizes every standard file dialog, so you can see a larger number of files. You will be able to find what you are looking for with a lot less scrolling.

One of the many useful features of Direct Folders is its ability to automatically switch the folder view of open dialogs to thumbnails, list or details depending on the application you are working with. You can select your preference of file sort order to be the default as well.

How Direct Folders works
There are several ways to access Direct Folders. One of the easiest is to simply double click in an empty area of the desktop, Explorer or File Open/Save dialog box, which brings up a menu. Total Commander and DirectoryOpus are also supported.


The ClickSwitch feature will make a file dialog instantly jump to the folder already opened in Explorer, Total Commander or Directory Opus. Just switch to the window you need.
