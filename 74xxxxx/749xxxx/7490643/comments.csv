Please create your account on some other website(s) also, and upload your amazing rips there too ; from where we can download the "".torrent"" files for convenience. 
Thanks for your great works and especially the small and tiny rips."
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-31T12:56Z,"Use magnet links and they are equipped with udp: trackers. As next, find one recent torrent of mine  posted here (torrents when are new are available for download as regular torrents). Tip is to keep one good active as template (or as working example) and then copy and paste in ones obtained as magnet-links
Then add trackers from such ""template"" in ""Properties"" of torrents gotten as magnet-links. Add all these trackers after existing udp:// trio and PUT ONE  EMPTY LINE then paste from clipboard."

I'll use magnet link.

but only that '.torrent' files are convenient as we can not download many of the uploads at a time and we keep the selected files on our hard disk and queue them up as & when required [there are so many good rips by you].

One thing though, about the "".torrent"" file, somehow it doesn't download even when new ""(torrents when are new are available for download as regular torrents)"", I've tried it several times on several uploads here, but still no use, it shows -- ""This webpage is not available""
but thank you for your valuable instructions and everything."
