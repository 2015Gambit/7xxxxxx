,ryzy,2012-08-02T20:57Z,If you have green icon in right bottom everything is ok. But if there is another one you have problem nd probably you must configure your utoreent client and router or lan if you use one.

I can't explain how to get it because i depends on system and i don,t know how exactly it is in english
Instead of 192.16.1.237 you can set 192.168.1.x where x is 2-255 the rest like in the picture. 
You lso have port to connect others in utorrent. Go to utorrent poperties and connection. Port should be number from 10000 to 65536.

If you have lan - you can,t do redirecting by yourself. Administator must do it.

But if have router go to settings. (Most cases - open browser and type 192.168.1.1) nd find something like nat/pat and create new rule.
Ip. The same you set in lan settings,
port the same you have in utorrent,
method/protocol both or if can set both - set two seperate rules for tcp and udp

I hope it help"
