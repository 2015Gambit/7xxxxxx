After seeing a lot of torrents from different sources and none had both video quality and the original english Fox audio I decided to make one myself.

Apparently all the new releases do not contain the original audio but rather the Disney dub.

Basically I demuxed the ac3 DVD audio from HobbitGamez DVD-R Fox version and remuxed it with the 1080p video from the AMIABLE release.

I set the audio delay to -6000ms and it syncs ok. This release has no subs or extra languages.

I also included the XBMC info and artwork scrapings from tmdb.
