,Crazy-Nish69er,2012-08-06T18:39Z,Hey there bone...Can you download a movie...that movie is called Snowbound...Thank you very much...peace
,xhizors,2012-08-08T06:20Z,TPB: Where you can find 15 different torrents with the same source and different names on it. Yay... I hope people upload this source some more tomorrow so I can download it with even less seeds. :)
,vafler86,2012-08-08T12:16Z,"@im_mr.sin, this look like the real deal. Try to only download torrent, where the uploader has a skull beside his name. You know he is a trusted source if he has a skull."
,claiho,2012-08-09T01:53Z,"Don't listen to this dumbass IIXVII. For a cam quality is pretty good.

A: 7
V: 7

Very watchable."

1st rule - LOOK AT FILES. 

Never download *.WMV files unless confirmed 100% real deal. WMV can make your Windows Media Player (and every player that use WMP) open an URL and run a spyware without you knowing it. Disable option ""obtain licenses automatically"" in WMP settings.

2nd rule - NEVER DOWNLOAD ANYTHING WITH POOR RATING

Ratings help a lot. Don't download anything rated too poorly. If it's only -1 or -2 and a lot better + it's propably safe. But if it's -3 or more and not countered with +, be on your guard.


3rd rule - READ COMMENTS, LEAVE COMMENTS TOO

It you downloaded a torrent and it's fake, WARN OTHERS. And read comments too. Be on your guard if a torrent has no comments. A lot of seeders means nothing, there's many torrents with a lot of seeders and they're fake. Personally I've never been able to understand people seeding such crap, but the fact is people do it a lot."
,bankhoop,2012-08-16T14:10Z,howz d sound
,luciano.duarte,2012-08-30T00:19Z,"V=5
A=4"
,Dr_Dassler,2012-09-05T18:52Z,"Hmm.. Comments to leave.. Well..

It's a bit confusing when lots of people stand up in front of a fight scene. Haha.

Quality comments..

V=3 / A=5 (Compared to BluRay)

V=4 / A=6 (Compared to DVD)

V=5 / A=7 (Compared to bootleg VHS)

V=10 / A=10 (Compared to not being able to see the movie at all)

Very watchable. Quit complaining. Thanks to BONE."
