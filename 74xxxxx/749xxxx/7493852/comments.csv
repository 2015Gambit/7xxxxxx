stupid VBR audio was used in the source so
very hard to keep them in sync when making xvids
as usual

I have a look at it later work out if ep2 can be fixed
easily.. random drifts are hard to fix though"
[V],psspss,2012-08-01T13:05Z,"ep2 is cut of on end too.. have to redo that episode looks like..

mind you nto sure if the series is worth watching
too much yelling

nat geo lowest show I think.. am colony is way better"
[V],psspss,2012-08-01T13:13Z,"I found a better source and will grab and convert
and share when get it for Ep2

ep2 each ad break drifted out but -500ms each
time.. by the end of the episode it was -1500ms
plus 10min is clipped 

Ep1 is ok though from what i sae"

,Djcole,2012-08-08T22:32Z,"thank you psspss. plays fine for me.
kind of strange seeing my family on tv.
there my cousins. p.s. when they say were not like americans... they mean like non gypsies.
they are not anti american. and not the way they realy are. the show is defenetly scripted."
