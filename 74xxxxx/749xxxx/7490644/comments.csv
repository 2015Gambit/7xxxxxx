10/10"
,natmil,2012-08-05T23:30Z,Very good quality!
,mofo431,2012-08-19T12:59Z,"Thnx for the upload, but the quality isnt good. It chops up and the sound gets very unstable when it gets loud.
Before anyone says its my harware, I want correct them and say its not, since my hardware works fine with any other flac files that have alot more going on then what this song has. I just wanted to tell everyone so they know..."
,mofo431,2012-08-19T13:01Z,"Ok, forget that last comment HAHA, it was my player LOL! So embaresing. GREAT STUFF! KEEP IT UP UPLOADER!"
,omniwig,2012-08-24T02:47Z,what mofo431 said. the song skips.
,omniwig,2012-08-25T09:08Z,scratch my last comment. got this FLAC mixed up with another FLAC.
,zwarm,2012-08-28T15:39Z,"To my friends above me in the comments, glad you got things sorted out. This track was ripped directly from a CD by myself and does not skip. "
,rkqqnyong,2012-09-12T06:59Z,"LOL Thank you!

I had a shitty quality mp3 file for this song, 

but now I can really enjoy the song with

You're so Gangnam Style~"
