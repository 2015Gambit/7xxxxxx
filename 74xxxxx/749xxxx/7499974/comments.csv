[T],rkstr,2012-08-03T15:29Z,"You can ignore the zero seeder stats @ScarletteSpider
there are over 500 seeders as of now, it will be a FAST download :-)
I don't know why the tracker hasn't updated my torrents for 2 days now."
,Fangular,2012-08-03T16:08Z,"Thanks again rkstr - am exceedingly grateful for your prompt and high quality uploads of this show!! (Not to mention the fact that you're the only person who seems to be uploading this season.) Am yet another Australian (there seemed to be a few of us according to the comments on the previous episode).. am not sure how relevant that is but I just wanted to let you know that you're greatly appreciated from all the way across the globe! 

PS. It downloaded super-quickly for me - so thanks for that too!

Cheers! :-)"
