Transerx, ID tracks are ones that no one has (yet) to identify, hence the ""ID"" tag as a placeholder.  This is because these tracks are either obscure (rare, but it happens) and will be named within a week or so by someone who recognizes it, or (more often than not) it's a new song by an artist (usually by the artist that is currently DJing) that hasn't officially been debuted or given a name.

Sometimes you'll see ""Ashley Wallbridge - ID.""  In this case, the id'ers agree that the tune follows the same pattern and sound as Ashley Wallbridge's works or Ashley himself stated it's his new tune, but the name just isn't released yet."
