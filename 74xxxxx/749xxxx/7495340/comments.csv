,hypnotoadtrance,2012-08-01T22:50Z,"As with before, this does not crack 25+ fps or 1080P. Sorry, I'm really not skilled at cracking at all. lol. But it enables most other stuff. Most importantly, the audio. :P"
,huhy,2012-08-01T23:09Z,"Works, thanks"
,FR33,2012-08-02T00:22Z,thanks!! i thought i would have to wait a few because of the update.
,auma,2012-08-02T02:25Z,"Yeah, it was so weird, I used it a few days ago, then the next afternoon it wanted to update figured the site released another one.

Works just like the last one, thanks again! :D"
,quidzhd,2012-08-02T04:05Z,"thx dude, i was waiting for this! much appreciated"
,scyris99,2012-08-02T04:45Z,Is there anyway you can crack the exe to disable the forced update check xsplit does?
,Senryakku,2012-08-02T21:10Z,Thanks again dude
,ghostdog94300,2012-08-03T01:06Z,Thanks !
,hypnotoadtrance,2012-08-03T22:30Z,"@scyris99 Unlikely. Again, I must stress that I have poor skills. However, it may be possible to block the update URL via the Hosts file...I can investigate this possibility when the next update occurs."
,whatisdeath,2012-08-04T04:16Z,"Thanks so much for doing this, man! Super appreciated, you're on the ball with this one, nice and prompt. :)"
,FR33,2012-08-04T12:26Z,"not sure of this is just me, but i got a small update to update the own3d plugin, i let it update then i got errors. there are about 4 errors total(iirc) if you close out of 3 of the error boxes(leaving one open) xsplit should still run correctly. not sure if the error happens no matter what(ie non cracked version). just an fyi."
,SR666,2012-08-04T17:03Z,"hypnotoadtrance, any chance you could look into cracking Dxtory 118 as well? It's a program that can be used in conjunction with Xsplit to great effect.
Thanks!"
,Gatherix,2012-08-07T00:43Z,"hypnotoadtrance, can you explain why the cracked executable tries to modify the registry key listed below?

HKUSS-1-5-21-1258702994-1955496142-88476118-1001SoftwareMicrosoftSystemCertificatesCA

I can't remember if it needed to use the .NET framework before the crack, but that part doesn't really matter. I just want to know about the registry key first.

Thanks!"
,nizzert,2012-08-07T05:15Z,"Thanks for the upload, but i have a question its something bothering me. When I run xsplit the first message that appear is ""Unable to rebuild Corrupted"" its something with the xsplit.db! i tried everything. Please help :)"
,AztroDude,2012-08-07T17:47Z,Thanks for the Upload
,Swordchan,2012-08-07T23:57Z,I'm also recieving this fcking annoying error at startup!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Unable to rebuild corrupted blablabal xsplit.db. please rename it and try again! Fcking hell that file does not even exist! what is this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Pripriyat,2012-08-08T09:45Z,"Works great, but yeah.. no 25+ fps :( But hey at least it fixes the disgusting 48kbps sound quality that they force you to stick with unless you buy AAC, even though MP3 encoding is pretty much free... "
,Swordchan,2012-08-08T12:26Z,Some1? know why i recieve the errors? Maybe my antivirus is removing it..
,Swordchan,2012-08-08T13:14Z,Nvm solved it. by downloading Xsplit from their site.
,bitchmagnet,2012-08-09T06:21Z,You said you only changed a hexadecimal in the .exe file if I am correct. Is this something you maybe could show me? So I can just fix it myself with the correct editor?
,NoPistons,2012-08-09T12:32Z,"As the hypnotoad says, it works just like the last patch did, it gives back the option to use AAC or MP3 audio but it won't allow for 1080 resolutions or more than 25 FPS. You get to use all the scenes too, at least for me 4 is not enough.

Works like a fucking charm and not being forced to use speex is what really matters. Just overwrite the file with the one provided and that's all."
,The511,2012-08-11T07:49Z,when i start it it ask's me for login name and password then it give's me a bunch of errors!
,IIBII,2012-08-13T01:01Z,also gettin errors when i log in. if anyone can fix this please give us a head up.
,wegwerfemail,2012-08-19T16:28Z,I also get these errors..... FIX IT
,zzk2001,2012-08-20T09:33Z,One big thing i hate about this is having to install internet explorer 7 ... I HATE IE and don't understand why i would need it for this program.
,huhy,2012-09-01T13:24Z,Seems that new update is out. Any crack available?
,huhy,2012-09-01T13:28Z,New update is out. Any crack available?
