Storms of magic are cataclysmic events that unleash terrible and all-powerful arcane energies, unbridled power that allows wizards to shackle titanic beasts to their dominion, or deny their enemies mystical forces that could destroy whole nations in one calamitous spell.

Storm of Magic is the first Expansion for Warhammer, the Game of Fantasy Battles. It's a 152-page, full-colour, hardback book with an integrated spinner in the inside front cover that just oozes with magical charm.

There's a staggering amount of background and history on magical storms, plus a full set of rules so that you can play a Storm of Magic battle using your armies. Within these hallowed pages you will find 64 of the most destructive spells and cantrips in the Warhammer world, and 45 Scrolls of Binding with which you can summon all manner of deadly monsters. There's even a whole section dedicated to sorcerous pacts, which you can use to call upon the power of Daemons and the Undead to aid you on the battlefield.
