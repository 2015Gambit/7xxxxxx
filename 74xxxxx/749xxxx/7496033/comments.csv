,nadroj321,2012-08-03T01:30Z,"Hey MrDowntown, I was hoping you could help me. The Marvel What-Ifs selection is pretty lacking on TPB. Sure we have that 2gig torrent, but it only contains the first 3 volumes. I've downloaded a few other singles, but there are only 11 torrents altogether, and only one other complete volume (9) uploaded. any chance you could get these? I'd appreciate it. thanks for all of the image!"
