KNOWN PROBLEMS:

    Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.x) is still beta. Please report any problem.
    Doesn't count properly global usage on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 - this problem affects other data counting applications as well and is caused by a bug on the tablet itself. You may try to check the "Calculate global usage from usage by app" advanced option as a possible workaround (feedback welcome).
    Doesn't count properly global mobile usage on Samsung Galaxy R / Z (i9103) and possibly Galaxy Y. Problems were also reported with the Captivate Glide. Same workaround as for the Galaxy Tab (see above).
    Early versions of 3GW Pro reported as not working on ZTE Blade/Orange San Francisco (black screen).
