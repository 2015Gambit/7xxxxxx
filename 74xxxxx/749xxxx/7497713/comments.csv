Regarding minuses, my stalker with multiple accounts clicks whenever he can on ""-"". He is VIP, but he has OCD or some nasty mental issues and obviously doesn't take (or miss) medication and when he have seen me back, he lost control... Click on torrent before and see yourself."

,theone71,2012-09-04T18:12Z,"Hey dude, thanks for this. The quality is really great !

I have one question though...  I've noticed that the Kansas scenes are in black-and-white instead of the original sepia. Is it like this on the BluRay or you did it ??

Also, could you post the filtering scheme you used for the degraining.

Thanks again !"

This gets a V/9 from me...Better than DVD quality and very much like Blu-Ray quality..... 8)"
