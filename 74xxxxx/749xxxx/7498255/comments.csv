,jamzkie,2012-08-06T21:13Z,can you do the Vampire Diaries in 1500kbps video bitrate or over 2000 overall bitrate? thanks
,engrpk,2012-08-07T16:49Z,Great quality boss but the speed is decreasing gradually. The first season was downloaded very fast but the 3rd one is very slow. Can you kindly do something about it?
,mike953100,2012-08-07T17:06Z,"@ engrpk 

Nothing I can do.  I am only one person.  This torrent will get faster if others actually seed it instead of removing as soon it is finished.  I hope it speeds up for you eventually though!"

Alright bro, thank you so much for sharing these 3 awesome quality seasons of BB. Would you be uploading the 4th season as well?"
,mike953100,2012-08-08T18:22Z,"@ engrpk 

Well, the 4th season done by VisionX was an HDTV Rip, and I do not want download/upload/watch that.  But, I can and will encode my own version of it, which will take a while.  The BluRay (25-30gb) will take some time to download, and then it takes 3 hours or so for each episode to encode.  So, it will not be up anytime soon, but hopefully I can get that done in a week or two."

Convert it to m4v using subler, ensure you have selected ""convert ac3 audio to aac"" in preferences. Worked for me. Good luck."
,coolspot18,2012-08-24T07:47Z,Amazing quality... no where is season 4? :D
,UAofE,2012-09-15T12:49Z,"""Amazing quality""? Compared to what? This is terrible quality. Very blocky and skips frames in some episodes."
