,Neraforesta,2012-08-02T09:18Z,"ehh...this is sort of a Cabin in the Woods situation. The movie is incredibly dark, and you will not get any better than this until an actual DVD copy comes out. Soooo, if you DL this, you wont be entirely disappointed, it is the best Ive seen out. The audio is entirely better, and the pic has been cleaned up a lot, buuuuuuut, its far from awesome.  I cant honestly give it a a/v cause it doesn't truly matter in this instant unless your are ignorant.  Its a snarch above par set by the single solitary only other file of this movie, but not by a lot.  btw...looks cropped a lot also, and a head pops up from audience once n a while."
