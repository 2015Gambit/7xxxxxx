Having secured the hard drive, Obsidian informs Professor Brain of her possession. The dark forces however do not plan on her keeping it for long. As the fuzz bombs emit their rank fumes, Obsidian falls...Upon consciousness, she realizes she has been transported to a secret chamber. Alone in the room, her hands are encapsulated while her legs are forcibly spread. Unmasked, Obsidian vows to hold out as she promises revenge. The device between her legs demands otherwise, and now at a crossroads of will and submission, only time can determine if our super-heroine has the fortitude to hang on...To be concluded next week
