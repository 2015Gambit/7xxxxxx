The Soundtrack of Our Lives with Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra

During an hour long concert special, we follow with The Soundtrack of Our Lives in the performance of a musical experiment together with the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. Well produced with personal potrait of each band member and beautifully filmed.

Integrating rock and symphony orchestras has been tried so many times. More often than not, it fails to create something better than the original. Not this time! An amazing performance by truly one of the best rock acts of our time.
