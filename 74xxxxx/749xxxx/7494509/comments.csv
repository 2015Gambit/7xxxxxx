It's an email client. You can easily switch to a different one if you'd like. If you're using IMAP, there's absolutely no reason to get ""stuck"" with one application.

That being said, Google just bought Sparrow. With Google seemingly abandoning their ""less evil"" philosophy, the reason I'd hesitate to use it going forward is that Google is an Advertising company, not a software, search, or email company. Every service they offer is centered around one thing: advertising."
