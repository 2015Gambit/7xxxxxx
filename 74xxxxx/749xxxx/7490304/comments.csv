,NexiumCore,2012-08-01T00:47Z,You can play multiplayer by using the server provided in offline mode and using the name spoofer. Everything needed is located at C:/users/yourname/appdata/roaming/.minecraft/server
,NexiumCore,2012-08-01T00:49Z,The only difference between playing online and playing offline/single player is that when you play online your user account has been verified against the login servers. You are shown the exact same interface and have the same options. You just have to join servers that are set to offline mode.
