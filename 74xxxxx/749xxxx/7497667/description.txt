VLC 2.0.4 beta 2Aug12 - fixes audio flaw on 1x5speed

seems to work better then the so called 2.02 alpha on my i7
the audio is less stuffed up it seems
but then I set cache to 9999 which seemed to help a bit on my lappy anyhow


this is the 32bit version... I  think theres a 64 ver but didnt bother getting
as I dont own a 64 pc but this should also work on a 64bit apparantly


enjoy and seed if grabbing
