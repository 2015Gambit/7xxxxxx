                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are 50 of the best songs featured in the teen films of the 1980s, as 
picked by me. Not all tracks were originally released during that decade, and 
not all were featured on the "official" soundtracks of their respective films. 
In fact, not all the films featured had "official" soundtracks, but included 
some of the songs you'll see here during the film itself.

Some films have multiple tracks included in this set. Of these, two were ripped 
directly from the audio of DVDs that I own, while the rest were compiled from 
various sources and re-tagged as a custom compilation. I have included the track 
listing in a separate PDF file. You'll need a PDF reader; if you don't have one,
there are plenty available for free on the Web. Acrobat, Foxit and Sumatra are
a few of the most popular. The track listing is also in a JPG for compatibility.

Please don't change the tags! As mentioned above, most of these are non-album 
tracks, and I believe many of the "official" soundtracks are out of print. Just 
queue up the playlist in your favorite boombox -- I mean, media player, kick up 
your Adidas, grab your favorite soft drink (anything but New Coke), and enjoy! :)
