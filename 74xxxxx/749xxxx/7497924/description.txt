Using local materials, a couple in Southern Ontario built their off-grid home on 65 acres of rolling hills without sacrificing any creature comforts. Beyond the exposed beams and country-chic interiors, the sprawling home features solar thermal tubes, a wind turbine and a swimming pool made from recycled car tires. Next, nestled in the woods outside St. Paul, Minnesota, this grand geodesic dome home can withstand earthquakes, hurricane winds, and tons of snow. Using 60 percent less material than a conventional house, the robust and energy-efficient home features gracious open-plan interiors with 18 inch thick walls, reclaimed wood and non-toxic materials throughout
