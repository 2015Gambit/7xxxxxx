The AVI specs are contained in the other Gulliver torrent from me, as I bound that one to the wrong files!  The MPG specs, then, are here, and can be copied from my post to apply to the proper files.  My apologies, but I did not want to miss posting them.  Please enjoy!

Gullivers Travels (1996) Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Peter OToole, Omar Sharif, Alfre Woodard

An Englishman returns after a long time abroad and tells his strange stories about the lands he visited which are allegories about the real world.  Danson is excellent in this role, making one believe in his character throughout.
I also have the mpg version, 6 Gb total (two times 3 Gb), at 29 fps. This is much smoother with better crispness, and I will u-l it if there is any interest.

Danson portrays Gulliver, the 18th century physician who takes eight event-packed years to return home.  Steenburgen is the devoted wife who stands by Gulliver when everyone says his story is the tale of a madman ΓÇô and what an unforgettable tale it is!  Join Gulliver as he towers over tiny Lilliput and its wishy-washy king (Peter OToole), as he becomes a pocket-sized fortune-teller in a land of giants ruled by a wise queen (Alfre Woodard), as he soars on a massive flying island piloted by intellectual airheads.  See Gulliver match wits with a sorcerer (Omar Sharif) and watch as he proves his mettle in a land where horses rule and humans are beasts.  For thrilling adventure and spectacle, dont miss this towering achievement.
