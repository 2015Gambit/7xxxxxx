And due to popular demand, here is the rest of Aldebaran, AND the sequel, Betelgeuse.

All the books are decensored, as pr usual, but there are both a censored and a decensored Aldebaran 3, since it took a while to decensor the TWENTY pages Cinebook had censored :).

I had written a lot of interesting stuff about the numbering confusion due to some of the books being in dual boko format, but due to TPB messing up, I'm passing on rewriting it for the 3rd time, so just know you need to read Aldebaran first, then Betelgeuse....and take your pick if you want to read the censored or uncensored Aldebaran 3.
