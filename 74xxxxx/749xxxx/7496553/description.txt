I am not the creator of this DVDRip, nor the torrent creator. I am a fan of the movie, and could no longer find any seeders. The torrent came with no NFO or README, and not finding any information on "CG", I cannot confirm the original author/creator. I apologize.

Note from me (torrent uploader): sometimes you rent obscure movies nobody uploads, and they're absolute shit. But this is a damn gem of a movie, and the more attention you put into the details, the more satisfying the ending can be. You may hate a Baldwin, but this is a unique movie with witty dialogue. Enjoy!
