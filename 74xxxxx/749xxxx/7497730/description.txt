W.A.I.K Portable

(Windows Automation Installation Kit)


Overview of WAIK:

The Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK) is a free download from
Microsoft that is designed to help IT professionals deploy Windows Vista.

The two main parts of the kit are Windows PE, and the Windows System Image Manager.

Windows PE is a replacement for those old DOS boot disks, allowing you to boot
a machine from CD/DVD and have 32-bit tools at your disposal. Windows System
Image Manager allows you to customize Vista images by adding/removing/configuring components using the unattend.xml file.

This portable version enables the use of WAIK without installing it.


WAIK Portable Tested on OS:

Windows Vista (No SP)

Windows 7 SP1


*SP means Service Pack
