,33dws,2012-08-08T03:14Z,"its the whole .app? can i change the _CodeSignature, _MASReceipt
and CodeResources.
folder?"
,SRSR333,2012-08-08T11:35Z,"Yes. I've already mentioned, in the description of this torrent. Please READ. Any similar questions, won't be answered. I have specifically mentioned that this is NOT the InstallESD image, and it IS the Install OS X Mountain Lion APPLICATION AS SEEN IN THE APP STORE, NO MODIFICATIONS WHATSOEVER EXCEPT FOR ZIPPING IT. And yes, you can change anything inside it. The software isn't mine for me to give you permission. You should ask Apple for that."
,balne,2012-08-08T13:06Z,"So, uh, can we install Mac Os X onto the com with this? PLease answer, cuz i suck at com stuff, and it's for school"
,SRSR333,2012-08-08T13:35Z,"If you own a Mac, yes. But if not, you still can install it into a PC, but it is very complicated for those who are relatively new to computers, or don't have much experience."

,HeyStupid,2012-09-03T02:07Z,Can anyone who has successfully install this share with us how you went about it? Anyone with a hackintosh able to install it?
,SRSR333,2012-09-03T12:10Z,"@HeyStupid,

As a matter of fact, I am a hackintosh user. You need a real Mac for this application to be of any real use to you if you want to hackintosh. Or else, go with a distro or VMWare image."
