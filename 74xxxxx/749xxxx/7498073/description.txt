New TV show for people who can't or don't attend a church by Revelation TV.

If popular or if there is demand i will continue to upload for you guys who can't watch it when it's aired.

Please seed and I hope you enjoy.

In the last 2 eps the sound was very jumpy however this has now been FIXED. 

TPB is making it very hard to upload lately and keeps giving me 'wrong code' error messages but will keep trying to bring these to you.
