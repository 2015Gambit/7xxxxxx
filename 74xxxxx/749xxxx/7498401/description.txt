Plot: This made-for-television thriller from director Mikael Solomon is based on an actual case history. Rob Lowe stars as Sgt. Drew Peterson, a cocky and cavalier police sergeant who seems to have it all: money, charm, a secure job, and a lovely wife named Kathleen (Cara Buono). He divorces his wife while courting Stacy (Kaley Cuoco), a young woman 30 years younger than he is; though initially charmed by Drew, Stacy soon feels put off by his controlling, consuming jealousy. Events grow darker and more twisted when Kathleen turns up dead in an apparent accident, and then Stacy herself mysteriously vanishes. The media begins to swarm around Drew, yet through it all, the officer remains convinced of his own impeachability and insists that he is innocent. This film originally ran on the Lifetime cable network
