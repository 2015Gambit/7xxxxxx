,ccCowboy,2012-08-04T14:15Z,I think you may have ripped the wrong version off the disc.  This one includes all the O'Hare comercials and is longer than the proper 1:27min length.
,atomicBS,2012-08-05T14:42Z,"@ccCowboy Actually you are WRONG, ""all the O'Hare comercials"" ARE PART of this movie."
,ccCowboy,2012-08-06T14:05Z,"I am sorry if I am wrong.  IMDB list the length at 86min and Blu-ray.com list the O'Hare Comercials as extra features.  I never saw this in theaters so didn't know what the original versions was.  I had downloaded a smaller file version first to see if I liked the movie that did not include the commercials and then found the info above.

Once again I thought there was an error but the rip and torrent are great."
,evilmonkey99,2012-08-30T23:44Z,"The movie works fine but the other audio files, every time you switch to another one that isn't English, the audio is badly out of sync. I only use VLC Media Player. I wish the Spanish one at least worked, but all audio files other than the English one are all badly out of sync with the video.
Just an FYI"
,atomicBS,2012-09-03T03:38Z,"@evilmonkey99 ""Just an FYI"" I test everything before I upload it, English Original Track was badly out of sync I had to replace it with the other one and it still gave playback problems, now that's not my problem bcoz I worked very hard for this and by the end of it ""A Wild anti-piracy out-of-sync scheme appears"" . At animation movies, I'll try my best to keep all the foreign sound tracks intact to ""respect our future"" (children) , this torrent here was madness but at least you have English audio with Spanish subtitles working and if your kids can't read then save it for later. I know I know I should've nuked all the foreign audio tracks and save bandwidth with it, APOLOGIES and will not be happening again
I'll be ADDING a ""NOTES"" sections at the ""iNFO"" from now on AND if something goes wrong it will be detailed otherwise It will have N/A which stands for  ""not applicable"" or ""not available"".
