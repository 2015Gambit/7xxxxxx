,BR_iZ_NSAN3,2012-08-24T07:35Z,"I'm not sure which member of the YIFY team made this video, but the quality is amazing. Most of your guy's rips are good looking but this one has 0 pix-elation and its not grainy at ALL noT even during dark scenes. What ever you guys did different on this one over the others, please do again with all vids.
