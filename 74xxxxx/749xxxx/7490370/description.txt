Description:

Tim is a young man with below average intelligence. He works as a 
builder's labourer, and is often taken advantage of by his fellow 
workers and other people. Mary asks Tim to work around her yard 
for a day. The day stretches into a few weekends, and the two soon 
become good friends. 

Some people, however, are suspicious of their friendship which seems 
to be continually strengthening, accusing Mary of taking advantage of 
Tim's innocence. 

Will changing circumstances in Tim's family life change his relationship 
with Mary?
