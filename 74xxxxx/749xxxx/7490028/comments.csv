,jorelson,2012-08-01T10:29Z,"Hi TR, first I got to say I love you work. Thanks heaps for all your torrents, especially the animated ones. 

I also wanted to please ask, if and when you get a chance or were interested, is there any way that you might see fit to look at putting up some quality encodes of the just released Star Trek Next Generation from Blu-Ray?

And would you also please be ok to with sharing your preferred methods for doing encodes?

Thanks heaps even if not on the last two, as I love and appreciate all your work :-)"

,ZaneBread,2012-08-06T04:53Z,"What do you use to add tags to your files and convert them? Thanks, good work btw"
,cstkl1,2012-08-16T11:22Z,"Its write there on the file in the metatag.

Encoding Tool : HandBrake 4808svn 2012070301
I suspect metaX or subler for his meta. Reason is it uses content id instead xid.

What i am curious about his encodes.
The multi subs. I dont think they are his work if its from blue rays. 
Y cause blue ray subs are in pgs. Its like a picture form. U need a translator with dictionary and it will scan and translate. U interrupt it most of the time to correct some by ureself.
Think they are reedited subs

[T],tr108,2012-08-30T21:37Z,"Guys, I'm sorry, but they'll be no more ups. Machine is down.

And, to be quite honest, since I'm not feeling how folks are talking about me (https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7561050/) while I'm out of commission, I'll never be back here. (too much drama in my offline life to read reckless bs about me on a bt site).

I never expected anything out of this -- I did it because it was fun, I love movies, had a spare machine, and know a little bit more about compression than the average man -- but now that the fun is gone, and the machine is dead, the ride's is over.

Since most of you have been kind enough to support with positive comments (and seed, hopefully), I figured I at least owed you a sign-off message."
,RadioActiveX,2012-08-31T05:17Z,"@TR108 Dude, maybe I should've kept my mouth shut and none of this would have gone on... But this people swear sometimes like ""you're the best, no you're the best"" and I felt like I needed to say something...

I wasn't trying to diss anybody or put you on the spot either, I was just trying to show some dude that there is more options out there.. Then cstk1 whatever started going on about technicalities..

Anyway, sorry to hear about your machine and thanx for sharing!"
,wisertime,2012-09-06T04:00Z,"Love your uploads in HD quality man! And so easy just to import them to iTunes,with cover,info and DD. Been tryin to rip some films myself,but i keep makin a mess out of it :( 

Really hope you will continue uploads for iTunes/Apple TV!

You ARE the best !!!"
,mavtt13,2012-09-10T21:48Z,"Come on, tr108! don't leave us out in the cold!! it is the end of an era..."
