This is my music collection. I was originally going to make it private but decided to share it. It's not much but it's the stuff I like. No hate comments please. Collection has:

All Blink-182 albums and songs, including
Neighborhoods
Blink-182
Take Off Your Pants And Jacket (all bonus tracks)
Enema Of The State

All Angels $ Airwaves albums
Love Part II
Love
I-Empire
We Don't Need To Whisper

The self-titled Box Car Racer album

And the +44 album When Your Heart Stops Beating

All the songs have lyrics attached too. Should also have the album artwork.
