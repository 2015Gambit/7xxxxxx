,peeyoosh1,2012-07-31T21:18Z,"Thanks for the help.
I'll use magnet link.

but only that '.torrent' files are convenient as we can not download many of the uploads at a time and we keep the selected files on our hard disk and queue them up as & when required [there are so many good rips by you].

One thing though, about the "".torrent"" file, somehow it doesn't download even when new ""(torrents when are new are available for download as regular torrents)"", I've tried it several times on several uploads here, but still no use, it shows -- ""This webpage is not available""

but thank you very much for your valuable instructions and everything."
[V],twentyforty,2012-07-31T22:15Z,"Start the download using magnet-links (""tweak"" Properties by adding trackers from some torrent /it must be mine/ as I suggested), wait till magnet-link turns into torrent (with proper name) then find THAT torrent in your uTorrent settings folder where program keeps active and finished torrents (determine folder in settings of uTorrent) and then either copy and paste one you need or pause it or do plain Stop till you  decide.

Other way is even simpler, just do plain Google for ""magnet2torrent"" and you'll find at least one working site which is specialized in turning magnet links into torrents. I usually have to visit two such sites and one always works nice. "
