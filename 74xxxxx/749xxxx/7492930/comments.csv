,renman99,2012-08-17T21:55Z,"Does anyone know how to save the text with Kate's voice, or does anyone have a manual? 

When I try to save to mp3 or wav it defaults to Microsoft Sam's voice in the audio file. "

Mine was crashing too, but then I blocked the application from connecting to the internet in my firewall and it stopped crashing. 

I too couldn't get Paul to install. "
