Where the bugger will I get my AOTS fix now?!? 
Thanks for all the hard work over the years, sniff sniff."
,chrisrand,2012-08-02T17:44Z,Alex is the worst!
,chrisrand,2012-08-02T17:45Z,At least tell us where you found Eclipse's releases so that we may continue spreading the good word.
,gibbits,2012-08-02T21:58Z,"@chrisrand Read the Notes.  Eclipse is the one quitting. Alex was just the guy distributing the torrent here on TPB.

Thanks to both Eclipse and Alex for their efforts!  Sorely missed, especially with David Tennant being on the show today!"

[V],alexisthebest,2012-08-03T10:07Z,"yea. i wrote this comment but comments werent working.


@chrisrand

In every screen shot (previous to this last week) has Eclipse's demonoid username and says it's from demonoid

And i've mentioned before, i just spread it on the torrent side. I use to get the files from him directly but he's no longer going to continue capping AOTS or X-play.

So not sure why you're acting as if i'm just not uploading AOTS when it's being released. It's just not going to be released at all..."
,theeGRated,2012-08-03T13:04Z,"noooooo!!! i havent had g4 for months and alex was the one id come to for the dl every day. sad to see you go man. although your work will still be appreciated, we cant thank you enough!"

Big thanks to @alexisthebest and Eclipse. It's gonna be tough now not to get my daily AOTS fix. 

Have to check the offical website for AOTS and check out individual clips. "

I miss Alex too...
We can cry together"
,TheAbstruseOne,2012-08-16T04:06Z,"I has a sad. I worked an overnight shift for several years so I would DVR Attack of the Show and watch it with my morning coffee (followed by Craig Ferguson) like it was a morning talk show. After I moved, I couldn't get G4 anymore so used these torrents the same way. It was always cool to wake up in the morning, see the new torrent waiting for me, start it downloading, then have it finished before my coffee was even done brewing. Don't know what I'm going to do with my mornings now :("
[V],alexisthebest,2012-08-16T10:05Z,"Maybe you guys can start watching AOTS again ;D
