Notes:

The day has finally arrived. Getting my final show online seemed almost impossible for me today. The live cap was bad had to wait about 4hrs for the re-run. Got the show encoded as soon the encoding hit 100% my internet went down which is EXTREMELY rare for me and would not come back online anyways... I started this back on October 19 2009. Before I started there was another user (unfortunately I can not remember his name) who would upload this show daily in a 200MB mkv format. He was banned and I came in just a few days after I got into capping/encoding and continued the AOTS releases. I did this as a hobby from the start and end with it as a hobby. I did some quick counting and this is probably my 635th release of AOTS. I thought it would be neat to re-upload my very first AOTS release (great Monday show). Don't expect great quality this was back in 2009 and my very first attempt to cap. So with that I say thank you to all of my loyal fans. Unfortunately real life catches up and I have to move on. Now I can only hope someone else continues this show for it's great fans. 


Uploader's notes:

Remember guys, dont thank me. Thank Eclipse for capping, encoding, and releasing AOTS,X-Play and special events like Comic-Con that were aired by G4. I found his uploads and I simply just helped spread his content on the torrent side while he did all the real work.
So any and all thanks are to Eclipse. We'll miss you buddy.
