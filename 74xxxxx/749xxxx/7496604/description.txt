    He is the fastest man who has ever lived and on 5th August
 the world will be watching and expecting Usain Bolt to reclaim
 the greatest prize in the Olympic Games, the men's 100 metres title.
 But there are five men who have been thinking the unthinkable, 
 men preparing and plotting to defeat the man they say cannot 
 be downed. Five men devoted to beating Bolt.
 They are: Jamaica's Yohan Blake, the current world champion,
 who is Bolt's training partner and strongest challenger; Asafa Powell,
 often the forgotten man of Jamaican sprinting, but still the last man to
 hold the world record before Bolt; Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin, who 
 lead the American charge hitting top form when it matters most; and 
 Europe's best hope, the Frenchman Christophe Lemaitre, who is 
 proving that white men can sprint and take on the very best.
   This film follows the fortunes of the world's best sprinters as they
 prepare for that ultimate showdown at London 2012, from the
 supremely confident superstar Bolt to his focused, sometimes 
 shy rivals, determined to prove that Bolt is just a man.
