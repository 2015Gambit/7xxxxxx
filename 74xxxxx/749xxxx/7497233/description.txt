MOTU's first soft sampler, MachFive, was released in 2004 as the 'Universal Sampler'. It was
 developed in conjunction with the French company Ultimate Sound Bank and used their 32-bit UVI
 audio engine. As a virtual instrument that could run on Mac or PC, it was available in all the
 major plug-in formats, and could load samples and patches in almost any current or legacy format.
 It also supported multi-channel surround as well as conventional mono and stereo audio, which was
 an impressive feature at the time. In short, there was a lot to like about MachFive, and it quite
 rightly attracted a lot of good reviews (not least from Sound On Sound) and loyal followers
