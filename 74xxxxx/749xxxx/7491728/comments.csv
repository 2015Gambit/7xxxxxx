THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR UPLOADING THIS!"
,SuperiorOfTheInBetween,2012-08-06T13:58Z,"Actually, I have a question. Maybe more like a concern. I have many videos in the *.mkv format, but this one...this one lags. EXTREMELY. I have tried my normal VLC Player 2.0.1, and I've moved to the 2.0.2, and even tried the Beta 2.0.4 that was put out four days ago (August 2nd). However, this lag keeps showing up, and it heavily destroys the video quality. Audio is perfect, but....

The video is an extreme lag.

Like I mentioned before, I have many other videos with this extension, both smaller and bigger file sizes. However NONE of them lag even the slightest bit. So its not my computer, nor the VLC player I'm guessing. 

Please help me...I'm an extreme Code Geass fan, and I've been looking forward to this little bit of video ever since it's existence was leaked onto the internet. Thanks in advance!"

greeeaaaattttt....
well, is there any way that I can....you know...get rid of the lag? 
NOTE: I have nothing on when using the VLC program. I go into task manager and take off anything that my computer doesn't need to run, so...yeah. And my computer's pretty new, with no viruses, so its ticking me off now. Is there a way to convert this video, English subtitles included?"
[T],[D],2012-08-06T23:33Z,"How new? A quad core, even a low spec one should be fine I think. How much of cpu is used when playing? You could try other players. Like mpc+lav+vsfilter (or cccp, a codec pack that has all the stuff)."
