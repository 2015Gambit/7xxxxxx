In 1961, Marvel launched the "Fantastic Four," a comic that was to revolutionize and popularize comic books.  It was the first "family" of super-heroes and when it debuted, the "Fantastic Four" broke every comic book rule:  the characters had no secret identities; they lived in a real city (NYC); had problems, worries and arguments, just like real people!  This definitive guide to the "Fantastic Four" provides a wealth of information about the history of the ground-breaking comic, plus fascinating facts about key storylines and all the major characters (good guys and your favorite villains, too) who have thrilled fans since the comic's creation.  Tom DeFalco has filled this compilation with more than 300 spectacular color images and "Fantastic Four The Ultimate Guide" is an invaluable addition to any comic book collection.
