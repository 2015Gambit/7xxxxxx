,jwreathford,2012-08-02T11:51Z,Great torrent. Works great as always. I have been using TeamExtreme's torrents for a very long time and have never had an issue. Keep up the good work guys. 
,GrimFate12,2012-08-02T14:04Z,"Great Torrent,

Game works 100% as does the automatic installer, no need to mess around in the appdata folder.

The server is great friendly people, no griefers in sight.

Nothing bad to say about the torrent

Thanks man kudos"

If you switch to 1.3.1, you can only connect to other 1.3.1 servers. right now there are very few because there are no 1.3.1 plugins out.

Went to play it today cause they released the new server version and dbl clicked on the shortcut for the client and it brought up the launcher and hit ok cause my user name was already in there and the launcher window closed like it does but after that nothing happend.

Tried even running it from the actual folder and nothing.

So I uninstalled and reinstalled only adding my saved worlds and still the same thing.

Once again I still have Java 7 update 5 which is the latest so it's not Java that's the fault.

Fix this."

I had that problem with 1.2.5 version of minecraft after... some playful pokes.

Though like all games, the first time you start it after install, the game lags when it firsts starts to play, give it a minute or two.

If that wasn't the issue...

So first thing is first, make sure your java is up to date.
Sometimes that'll solve the problem. If that fails, reinstall."

,FlashyG,2012-08-26T21:42Z,"""Their admins might not be very friendly, but then again they have to deal with idiots like you AND run the server making sure even follows the rules.""

Ok so yes it's a PITA dealing with enforcing rules, but that doesn't excuse the staff being rude and complete dicks to people.  Also I question the degree of competency they have of even running a server.  A few of the larger issues on their server include (but not limited to):

-A really bad lag issue that has existed for quite some time now
-Rude Mods/Admins
-A huge problem with people falling into the void upon login and losing all their items (they'd rather just tell people ""tough luck"" than fix it apparently)
-No standardized punishment for any given offense.  One person will be banned then unbanned a few hours later while somebody else is banned for days for the -same- offense.
-Their transition to 1.3.1 has been one big giant disaster despite them supposedly having a test server and acting like they have been working on stuff there for weeks beforehand.
-They have an economy yet no real way to get money into it other than VIP's spending their donation money or selling dirt/cobble to the admin shop

TE proves one thing, bigger is not always better."
,Lol_man,2012-08-27T07:37Z,"@FlashyG

Teamextreme is THE best server I know of, administration is dealing with a huge amount of people, and keep in mind they are humans too. Most of them have jobs, have families, and other interests. Just like everyone else.

I understand that you are 100% entitled for your own opinion, but you do not have to bitch about it. 

Yes, the server IS laggy, no fucking doubt about that, but keep in mind, TE has over 200 people connected AT ONCE, and most servers can't even hit 4 players, obviously, there is going to be lag.

And as for people having different punishments for the same crimes, let me say this. The server has a ban appeal system. And depending on how the banned player posts hisher appeal, the punishment will vary. If the player appears to be legitimately sorry for committing a crime, wouldn't you agree that his sentence should be shorter than the other guy? That bitches and moans about how he didn't grief, or saying that the rules are stupid, and griefing should be allowed, or all the other crap along those lines?

Yea, just something to think about."
,FlashyG,2012-08-27T13:25Z,"For one that server never has 200 players on it. It breaks 100 by a fair bit sometimes, but not 200. And the 'its because of so many players' excuse is just that, a lousy excuse. Given the hardware they claim to have even 200-300 players shouldn't be a problem. I have personally been on servers which had that many and guess what, there was minimal to no lag. But props to the staff there for brainwashing many of the users into believing the shovels full of shit they feed you with the excuses for the various issues. It would be impossible for me to agree they are THE best because of the very issues I listed, even ban lengths aside. Really the only thing I tend to think they really got right is the plugins they run, it keeps things close to core minecraft while adding social aspects (factions) and an economy (which honestly isn't properly implemented)."
,FlashyG,2012-08-27T13:37Z,"Oh and as far as people falling into the void. Your brilliant server owner simply replies with things such as ""This happens sometimes, can't do anything about it sorry."" or that they are looking for a ""working"" fix. Want to know how long it took me to keep that kind of thing ever happening on my server? 2 minutes finding a plugin, 15 seconds to d/l it then u/l it to server, then 30 seconds tops for a server restart. Fixed in under 5 minutes."
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-08-27T16:29Z,"@FlashyG 

You have a max 20 player server, we had over 240 players online at once last night...

The problem is using a standard Craftbukkit why we are getting ours modded for the new patch. Bukkit is not made for 200 players hell its not even made for 100. 

The issue is with the new patch changing the mechanics and preventing more then one player sharing the same location, now add some lag and a player will get pushed through the ground and into the void, this then triggers a death and due to the way Bukkit handles void deaths, it makes it very hard to fix, since it bypasses most mechanics that the plugins use for that part of the API.

Maybe next time before you come crying here, maybe you should pull your head out of your ass."
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-08-27T16:34Z,"This screen shot should be taken at about 7am US time and it has 186 and the DNS says it has 187

Now this is at 7am... What do you think it would peak at, say 7pm?"
,FlashyG,2012-08-28T00:04Z,"More of the same lousy excuses. For one, as I already stated, there are servers that push 300+ with no lag.  So trying to say 'waaahh but its bukkits fault' is just yet another shovelful of the same BS.  Your fanboy users might buy it but anybody that's been around on some big servers that are actually well run knows it's entirely possible to hit 300+ and not have unplayable levels of lag.  And the void deaths are fixable.  I'm not sure if you are too proud to admit you're wrong, too dumb to realize you're wrong or just too lazy to actually fix it so you continue doing nothing about it.  Either way it doesn't change the fact that preventing people from getting killed via falling through the void is not only fixable but a very easy fix."
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-08-28T04:25Z,"@FlashyG

You don't even know what your talking about for one. Its very simple go to one of the +300 servers and do /version and you will see they are using a custom CB or CB++

It is impossible to run a 300 server on a normal CB, there is thing thing called, ticks maybe you should look into it. 

Now the big 4 servers actually pay devs allot of money to consistently code for them.

Now b4 you respond like a retarded, maybe you should look into bukkit API and then you can shoot your self in the foot as much as you like.

,FlashyG,2012-08-28T08:55Z,"Well lets start with the fact that you think allot is a word yet question somebodies IQ.  It's a lot.  Not allot, not alot.  A lot.  And it's you're, not your in that sentence.  You can't even grasp basic language skills and are the last person that should be attempting to estimate anybodies IQ.  But seriously when will you stop with the excuses.  Your was lagging hardcore even with just 60 or so players on it.  Give it a rest, you are incompetent and it's as simple as that.  Even if what you are saying were true then it's still YOUR fault for not doing something about it.  Apparently you'd rather keep the server cap set at 1337 because it looks ""cool"" than setting a limit that your server can actually handle.  Next you'll try to tell me it's impossible to keep people from getting glitch deaths in the void too."
