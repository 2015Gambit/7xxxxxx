Plot: The flimsy premise sees the Japanese nuclear disaster mutating a flu virus into something more deadly, unleashing the usual undead apocalypse on the world. This includes Taipei, where the government has been trying to prevent the spread of the zombie plague by creating a quarantine zone and sending in SWAT teams to evacuate civilians and wipe out the ghouls. Unfortunately, one of these police squads crosses the path of a violent mafia gang, and the two are soon at each others throats, until being forced to join forces to survive. Meanwhile, a bizarre perverted murderer (played by director Chien himself) uses the chaos as a cover for snatching more female victims, who he keeps chained up in his basement for his own sick pleasures. A young mother called Linda (model Yvonne Yao) has the misfortune to fall into his clutches while trying to escape the city with her daughter, and ends up in one of his cages awaiting a dreadful fate.
