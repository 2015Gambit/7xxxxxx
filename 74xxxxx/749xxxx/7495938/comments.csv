,BasilBrush,2012-08-02T23:44Z,"Sorry, I haven't the time. To encode 4 hours of 720p would take about 20 hours on a Core 2 Duo followed by another 12 hours to upload. Maybe with a Quad core processor and a higher broadband speed it might be possible. As programmes are being broadcast every day you need to complete the encode/upload release cycle at least every 24 hours otherwise I start falling behind. With multiple encoding PC's and limitless broadband speed (like they have at the BBC) it's possible to encode everything."

(Maybe you can upload in HD after the Olympics have ended? :) )"
