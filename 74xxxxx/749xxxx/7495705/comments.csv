,madmocha,2012-08-23T02:00Z,Oh crap!  AWESOME!!!  I can't believe you have this.  Wanted to buy it at the store but didn't have the 10 bucks.  Just happened to come to your uploads list from the NY Times bestseller page.  Thanks for this.  It's the ONE issue of this mag that I try to pick up each year.
