3)  Happy House 
This award-winning, 4,000-square foot energy efficient home in Houston, Texas has loads of personality and plenty of green features, too. Beyond the solar panels, recycled denim insulation, and heat resistant extra-thick concrete walls, the home features sprawling multi-purpose living areas, and an indoor slide that offers a quick alternative to the stairs. Full of personal decorative touches and overlooking a glacial lake in Rollins, Montana, this 2,400-square foot home is embedded in a steep slope to take advantage of the Earth's thermal benefits. The green home also features local and salvaged materials with Amish-built kitchen cabinets, a spectacular green roof, and an interior wall that looks like ancient ruins.
