The book is in Polish, BUT READ ON...

I took the pictures from the similar torrent here and combined them into a PDF file. It took me a while and I managed to make the PDF available for editing, meaning you can now copy the text and translate it using Google Translate. I tried translating the whole book but it is too big, I tried splitting it into sections and translating but it cannot be done, the only option is to copy portions of text that interest you and translate them individually. I think that now you can manage to get the info you're after, with a bit of work(pictures in the book + translate=bingo).

Thanks to the uploader of the pictures.
