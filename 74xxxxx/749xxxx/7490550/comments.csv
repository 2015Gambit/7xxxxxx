,craddle,2012-07-31T16:25Z," Torrentday.com is now an invite only site. If you are lucky you might have a friend who wants to invite you! We just want to see how many cheaters will start respecting their accounts after they realize they canât just come back in and get another one.

Please be careful about who you invite to the site, if we think you knowingly invited a cheater both yours and the person you invited accounts will be disabled.

If you want an invite and you know someone who has one, its up to you to contact them to give you an invite we do not relay messages to users."

Platform: Windows 7 "
