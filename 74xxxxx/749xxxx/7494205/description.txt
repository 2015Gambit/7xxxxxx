Afgin, a renowned Israeli producer and DJ, returns to his independent imprint Premium Music with Ray Of Light, the final chapter in a trilogy that began with Emotional Peaks and The Dream Master. Featuring four new songs written in the last year, this release is split into two halves. The first half is all about elevating, heart-pumping, melodic Goa trance to greet the rising sun. YouΓÇÖll be diving into warm and subtle sound envelopes produced with a clean and precise touch to fill open air dance floors. The second half focuses on uplifting, anthemic European-style trance loaded with harmonies and powerful emotional atmospheres that will get your heart to open up and your legs dancing all around. This is where elegance and emotions meet your ears! Mastered by Elad Afgin with artwork by Itzik Norani.
