,fabiomoron,2012-08-02T17:24Z,"Thank you!!!!!

But... i'snt it week 47?"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-08-02T17:40Z,"Well,actually it's not.I knew that last uploaded week was 46,but everybody ignored one week where DC only published one title:Justice league,and that officialy was also new 52 week,so this is the right week numbering-trust me. "
,Ichiroyoung,2012-08-02T18:12Z,"mirror master is right 

i skipped the 1st week so the confusion is all to blame on me"
,fabiomoron,2012-08-02T18:15Z,"Wow! Didn't know that!

Thanks for the info. Gotta check now what week was that!
"
,fabiomoron,2012-08-02T18:21Z,"Ichiro, so the 1st week it's only Justice League #1?
"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-08-02T18:29Z,"Ichiroyoung:lol.Just uploading this week instead of you,hope you'll get back to uploading soon."
,Rabbbi,2012-08-02T18:39Z,thanky much!!
,Tresonite,2012-08-02T19:04Z,any chance of uploading a marvel week?
,riverchase,2012-08-02T21:51Z,thank you so much
,Ichiroyoung,2012-08-02T22:03Z,"@mm82 no problem thanx for uploading.

I really hope 2 be back soon"
,LCSINpatria,2012-08-02T22:31Z,"@ Tresonite:
I think someone did it last week, also the ""Marvel I like"" torrent usually has the good releases (though i didnt see it this week), but if thats not enough maybe u should start the ""marvel bulk"" each week, i think MrDowntown has a link on his torrents that teach you how to make and upload torrents"
,cryptoc,2012-08-02T23:32Z,"Thanks Mirrormaster, very much appreciated."
,ddot,2012-08-02T23:39Z,Thanks as always. I have look all over and can't seen to find anyone who has recent Spawn comics. I have from 1 - 215 or something but recently the uploads have stopped. Do you or Ichiroyoung know of anyone who still uploads Spawn? Thanks again. 
,whoresman1,2012-08-03T01:17Z,Thanks dude! you rule!
,lHammerToe,2012-08-03T05:50Z,"So can someone clear up this numbering confusion for me?

Should I renumber the 1-47 weeks I have and make it 48 or does it matter? I'm assuming whatever the Justice League comic was is in one of Ichiro's torrents but I'm anal about these things."
,leafnin56,2012-08-03T13:08Z,Just created this account to thank mm82 and Ichiroyoung for all these releases. been enjoying them each week. :)
,neverovatnimiki,2012-08-03T13:31Z,"Sorry, but I can't find week 46. May u help me and put the link for it, please?"
,new52,2012-08-03T17:19Z,"think we'll get 52 ""+1's""?"
,kissfan1,2012-08-04T11:38Z,Thanks for helping out!
,basil380,2012-08-05T04:24Z,"I want to thank Ichrio, Mirror, Cryptoc and who ever else has helped get all of these comics up for everyone to enjoy!  Thanks a lot guys! Your'e great!"
,imredjimmy,2012-08-05T06:32Z,"Omg, I was so sad cause I couldn't find week 47 anywhere, now I know why XD Thank you so much for uploading this! Finally Rotworld. And the last JLI? I know I'm like one of the only people who enjoys this book..."
,Retro_Geek,2012-08-06T04:38Z,"Hi Sir, thank you for the upload! Wondering if #5 is on it's way? please?? 

Yes, I KNOW it's vertigo.."
,RealEffingDeal,2012-08-06T20:59Z,"THANKS MIRROR, i love u and all the other upploaders "
,RealEffingDeal,2012-08-06T21:05Z,"THANKS MIRROR, love U and all the other upploaders. Question though. Do U have the Robin Vol 4 Issues (that ran betweens 93-09, 195 issues)?? If not, do, U or enyone else here, know How/Where to get them???? THANKS AGAIN "
,mike18xx2,2012-08-09T06:20Z,"Thanks, uh....but did you really have to rename these files in such a way as to ensure that EVERYBODY else will be re-renaming them so they'll fit in sequence with their collections? What a PITA this is every week...."
,mike18xx2,2012-08-09T06:21Z,"BTW, nobody's posted a Week 47....???"
,AILD,2012-08-17T18:42Z,i need justice league 11 and 12 can't find it :'(.
,asgrade,2012-08-28T05:39Z,Where can i get the weeks between this and the last upload of Ichiroyoung.
