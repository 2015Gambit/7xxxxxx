Yes to my first post about what this series might be all about.

Episode one features only Hungarian dubbing and I couldn't get my WD Live to bring up English subtitles.

I've deleted this episode and am going for another ""Threshold"" torrent which is in English with Czech optional subs - which I don't need.

If you don't mind Hungarian dubbing, then Threshold.S01.720p.HDTV.x264.HUN.ENG-aljasPOD is the one to go for?"
,DENi1989,2012-08-04T09:59Z,"1. There was no question mark in your first comment, so I thought you just write a summary of the show.

2. Check the IMDB link above.

3. All episodes have English dubbing too, see the description. They are secondary though, but you can change it.
Maybe your hardware doesn't support dual audio in .mkv container. If that's the case, you can freely remove the hungarian dub with MKVToolnix, or change the audio priority. Your choice."
