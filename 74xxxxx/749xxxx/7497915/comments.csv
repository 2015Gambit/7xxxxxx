Seems like something odd is happening. At Least for me.

I love these old mags and downloaded the SWS-WS torrent when it was posted on demonoid.  I've also had downloaded the others you had posted there.  

You may want to have a look at eBookVortex.  I've already posted some of your torrents old torrents from the demon there and there seem to be a lot of refugees that were there for the ebooks."
