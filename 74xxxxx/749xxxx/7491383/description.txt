Fingerprintz hailed from Scotland and was formed in 1979 by Jimme ONeill and Cha Burns. They released three albums: The Very Dab (1979), Distinguishing Marks (1980), and Beat Noir (1981). The latter, featured here, is in my opinion their best work, blending post-punk/new wave influences with very catchy hooks. They earned some critical recognition and notable appearances on John Peels radio show and the BBCs "In Concert" radio series. The group split in 1985 and ONeill and Burns went on to form The Silencers, who played well into the 90s.

There is another version of this album with the songs in a different order and the inclusion of the great "Echohead" and "Famous Last Words", but these arent on MY version of the album!
