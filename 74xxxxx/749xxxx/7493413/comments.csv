BUT....

This is NOT 3D. Yes, it is SBS and you need 3D glasses to watch it, and it is nice sharp 1080p, so I guess it is an attempt at a 2D to 3D conversion. (the original was never made in 3D, was it??). I viewed it on an LG 55inch Cinema 3D TV but I could not see any depth or 3D at all.

Thanks for the effort uploader but I think you wasted your time cos it just didnt work. Better luck next time.
