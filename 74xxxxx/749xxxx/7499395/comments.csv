Gosh this show sucks, but I can't stop myself from watching it. It's like a traffic accident that keeps adding cars to the pile-up...it's horrific but I need to see just how much of a disaster it becomes."

,SrMLove,2012-08-05T04:54Z,@FriendlySpidey & JacKerouac: what a shitty quality to have... you guys suck. that is the last way you should treat a traffic accident. i hope you get into one... maybe then you wont be such douches.
