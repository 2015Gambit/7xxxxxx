Extra Notes: 
Release notes:
DoNE AR is 640/256 = 2,50. Bluray/DVD source AR is 2,40, so AR is off by
2,40 - (2,50 / 2,40) * 100 = 4,16 %. We guess that they forgot to uncheck the
'Follow ITU-R BT.601 Standard' checkbox in gknot, which means that the reported AR is
~2.5 % wider than the actual AR and that their encode is unnecessarily stretched.
See included screenshot for that. We also included their sample.

P.S.: AC3 5.1DD sound and subs for everbody's viewing pleasure!

Enjoy
