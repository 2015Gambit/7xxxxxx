,cristina.ashley,2012-08-08T02:42Z,Does not work on a Sprint iPhone 4S. It says there is a compatibility issue. Any suggestions?
,Hakkr,2012-08-08T05:53Z,"@cristina.ashley That's because this is for GSM networks such as AT&T or T-mobile. Verizon and Sprint iPhones are not supported by this version. However, you may be able to find a CDMA (Verizon, Sprint) version elsewhere on TPB."
,TtToker,2012-08-28T03:12Z,Thanks Hakkr for answering Cristina's question & thank you uploader but I'm to scared to try to install this.
