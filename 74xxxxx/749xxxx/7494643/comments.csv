,Frogstar1988,2012-08-01T20:30Z,"mhm it isn't working for me but I don't think that the torrent itself is broken since it works for everybody else.
Dose somebody know what this error means.
Error: Could not xreate the Java Virtual Machine
Error: A fatal exception has occured. Program will exit.
Maybe somebody can help me there."
,spind0g,2012-08-01T20:30Z,"Had the 1.2.5 ver. - legit..
Now leeching, soon seeding."
,Zerketh,2012-08-02T00:12Z,"People says it works for them but whenever i start this cracked version, i get sent to the legit minecraft launcher which I dont have a premium account. I keep re-installing but the same thing happens to me. Could anyone help me?"
,anilem,2012-08-02T00:51Z,"@hitmanc11: we don't change anything on the client. check the mods if they are up to date.

@Frogstar1988: it is a local java problem. try reinstall java.

@Zerketh: read the torrent description, type any username, dont use a password, press login, press play offline :)"
,ArchDeath111,2012-08-02T07:42Z,"Installed perfectly and just put in a username with no password, but the 'Play Offline' button is grey and will not allow me to click it. What is wrong and how is it fixed?"
,bhmiji077,2012-08-02T13:57Z,"hi man! looks nice, downloading now.
one question:
does LAN servers work on this version?"
,Frogstar1988,2012-08-02T17:44Z,ok tried reinstalling Java still the same problem. I don't get it 1.2.5 worked just fine.
,Bleric,2012-08-02T18:06Z,"Installed, and Works perfectly ^_^. Thanks for the upload bud!!"
,GrimFate12,2012-08-02T23:22Z,"Dont bother downloading this. Its not cracked at all, hes just copied his minecraft settings over, The fact that the game is asking for a passsword and you have to click ""Play offline"" shows this.

,Skink089,2012-08-03T09:50Z,i had it for about a day (worked fine) then it started to close randomly i had 1.2.5 never did it now it does? please help?!?!?
,linkas7,2012-08-03T10:58Z,"Im using anilems 1.2.5 crack, I created a LAN server using CraftBukkit, can I still run the same server using 1.3.1? Is there a way to transfer the data if not? Or do I have to start all over? :("
,jinzouningen,2012-08-03T23:57Z,"Some people may need this i have windows 8 and 1 of my Windows 7 laptops i had to do it also 
there couple things
1. Make sure you have the latest Java Runtime
Java com
2. Once install is done go to properties on My Computer, [System Properties], advanced tab, Environment Variables button, then under [System Variables] find Path then Select and click Edit add the path to the Javas bin folder with a semicolon ; before ex: ;C:Program Files (x86)Javajre6bin

3. Restart your computer

Another issue I've had with an earlier install was the minecraft folder itself, i had to make a second copy of it inside the C:UsersUERNAME-HEREAppDataRoaming i had to make Minecraft and .Minecraft folders, and run it from the Minecraft folder, but it used the datafiles inside the folder with the . so I had to install mods into that folder
Hope this is helpful if not go buy the game, really buy it anyway if you see some of the work people have done on these servers, there is even a Server that completely remade the World of Warcraft and you have classes and levels and all lol great stuff"
,D34THW41K3R,2012-08-04T02:32Z,"@Zerketh
read the instructions on the torrent description again... pay closer attention :P"
,reev92,2012-08-04T15:54Z,"Works like a charm. Tip: on login screen u dont need to enter user neither, just click on login then play offline and u're good to go. Thanks for the upload."
,XClownFace,2012-08-04T21:13Z,"to Frogstar1988:

,sudarsan,2012-08-09T16:07Z,"ATTENTION WARNING:

please do not download and install this game. heres wat happened to me.

when i installed it asked me to install it in C drive and the option for me to select a different drive was disabled.. i was suspicious at that time but i continued installation.. after installing i played the game for a few minutes and my computer shutdown BOOM ...

I tried to restart it and i got a message that said windows 7 cannot start, please restore your computer to an earlier point.. then i had to restore my computer to an earlier restore point.. 

then the first thing i did was to uninstall this peice of shit from my c drive... and revoke permission for this shit from windows firewall...and i scanned my computer using avira .. and now my computer is back to normal and fast..

TO THE UPLOADER FUCK YOU NIGGA FOR TRYING TO KILL MY PC YOU SICK PIECE OF SHIT"
,Ortiz817,2012-08-09T23:23Z,@sudarsan are you sure it this i have been using this for about two days and my computer never randomly just down
,ultimatepokamon,2012-08-11T09:54Z,"@sudarsan

It's just your PC."
,rohking,2012-08-12T21:34Z,"Game Works A-Okay, only problem is I dunno how to play online, not a LAN game"
,rohking,2012-08-12T21:38Z,"@sudarsan

,Alvarezwilliam16,2012-08-13T09:41Z,"to people saying END OF STREAM.TeamExtreme is still on 1.2.5 to play on Teamextreme you must use the 1.2.5 installer.

,adeertehPr0,2012-08-15T10:28Z,"This is the BEST MC 1.3.1 Cracked release I have EVER seen in my life! Thanks Anilem!!!

BTW, if you wanna play creative with no rules and decent ping... 'play.minecraftinstall.net' is for you!

Anilem, you're the best!"
,sudarsan,2012-08-15T17:53Z,"yea man probably its my PC thats fucked up... now i can't play any games in my laptop since. the battery had died.. when i play games my laptop needs more power output which my battery is unable to provide hence my laptop shuts down whenever i play any game...

damit now i have replace my laptop battery"
,greenllama,2012-08-15T22:05Z,"Sudarsan your fake story is somewhat pathetic.. you restored to an earlier restore point and then still had to uninstall the game from your hard drive?
.....
the option to install to a different drive was disabled?
......

At least come up with a better story to deter torrenters"
,AkeeMax,2012-08-16T18:58Z,"Works great just like your 1.2.5 Thanks anilem.
Also use -gametracker- (Google it) to find private minecraft servers to play online! Cheers mates."
,jos3_riv3ra,2012-08-17T05:00Z,@sudarsan I guess you need a new hardware
,Temote,2012-08-18T07:16Z,"Took five minutes to fully download. I love it, is flawless! 10/10"
,fierylava12,2012-08-19T06:49Z,"***CRACKED; WE ALLOW CRACKED USERS***

Just kidding...now that I got your attention
Go to http://www.gametracker.com and register to win a free Iphone 6 in stores December 21, 2012 aka the end of the world...hurry before you get killed ."
,yomyssebyy,2012-08-22T12:28Z,"if you want to have skins , download the mineshafter proxy , and you'll figure it out what you have to do on the website , also , with the proxy you can join other mineshafter servers and have your skin seen by people.
If you want a server try kingscraft
Also, the installer works fine
P.S. advice: while X-raying in servers ,  don't do theese noob tunnels straight to the dimonds ,you'll get banned, make nice tunnels , use torches , be smart
last step:  have fun!"
,lawlbean,2012-08-24T07:43Z,"when i downloaded it it wasn't 1.3, it didn't have the emerald ore or anything like that in creative"
,Jerk_Cyb,2012-08-24T23:30Z,Is it possible to use the Command Give Codes on the cracked version?
,xSilvershooterx,2012-08-27T02:53Z,You can test if Multiplayer works on brrtgaming.nitrado.net :) 
,liquidmoon,2012-09-01T01:35Z,"@fierylava12 yeah I'll get right on that, because a cell phone is something I need when I'm dead in 3 months, you make no sense, hey guys go to dipshit.com and you can win a tv before you die, why watch it outside when you can watch it in the comfort of your own living room, with HD 3D glory. 

Now you see how stupid you sound."
