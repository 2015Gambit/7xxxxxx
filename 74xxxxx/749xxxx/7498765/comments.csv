,Svajone,2012-08-04T11:51Z,"LOL Yeah it is dumb. But Dolph is still legit for an action meat puppet. Cuba I can take or leave. Dolph was worth it though. 30 minutes of download time. 1.5 hour movie. I didn't feel like my time was wasted.

,kcc02,2012-08-15T14:44Z,no sound when I try to play it on the ps3
,ViolentC,2012-08-15T18:14Z,"@kcc02  it's a computer file not a PS3 file... why do you buy those overpriced, outdated retard-boxes. open a bloody window and throw your console out it. then buy a HDMI Cable and plug your computers video card DIRECTLY into your HDTV/Plasma screen and press play. 
Please don't complain when a computer file wont play on a console. who said it should???"
