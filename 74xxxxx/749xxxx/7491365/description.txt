With his crew in tow, Steve Backshall is on a mission to find all the animals that most Africans spend as much time as possible avoiding.

An eerily close encounter with a ragged tooth shark is followed by getting airborne with the awesome black eagle. Unlike Rourke the eagle, Steve comes down to earth with a bump.
