This is the eagerly anticipated first book in a new series from Warhammer Forge, and as its name suggests Monstrous Arcanum deals with a veritable carnival of monsters both arcane and bloodthirsty. Within this 113 page, full-colour hardback book, you will find 32 new monsters ΓÇô nightmarish horrors and noble beasts, creatures of magic made flesh and the victims of terrible curses inflicted by dark powers ΓÇô presented in the form of Binding Scrolls for use with any Warhammer army.

These are not limited to just Storm of Magic games, however, as the book contains nine scenarios and special rules to allow these deadly creatures to be fielded in regular Warhammer battles, and a helpful appendix chart to allow you to theme your monsters to your army.
