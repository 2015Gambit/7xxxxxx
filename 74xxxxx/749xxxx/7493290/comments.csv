Yes, this is legit, there is no seeders because I have just uploaded it to the bay. "
,deanjohnston,2012-08-01T09:36Z,hey dude if you changed the torrent name to Geordie Shore S03E06 you would get a lot more seeders. (i.e. remove the P)

Any reason why you don't upload to newsgroups?

Just wondering as its what eveyone seems to be using nowadays and there's no seeding, leeching problems etc.

Im stuck at 30% :("

,james78911,2012-08-01T18:44Z,"@7yellowcard7 
what are you talking about? 
I don't use Newsgroups because I am happy with torrents and I don't want to pay to access my files."
