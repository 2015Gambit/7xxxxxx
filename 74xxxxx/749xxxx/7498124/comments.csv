Every 5 seconds is a slow motion scene that RAPIDLY gets on your nerves.  Most likely to cover up the fact there really isnt a plot to speak of.  Then the magically act like a ship thats been dry docked since WWII and is used as a tourist attraction has actual live ammunition aboard it.. and could still fire...  I nearly laughed my ass off.   Common practice in US Military is decommisioned ships are in fact, de-commisioned.  The barrels are fused shut, firing computers removed, etc etc etc.  And it sure as shit would NOT have live ammunition aboard. "

It is a pretty hard thing to hold too, so if you had, say, 30 strong sailors, they wouldn't all be able to get close enough to it, to pick it up, much less carry it..Lucky, I guess, that they find live 16"" ammo in a ship that has been decommissioned for 20y.

who never passed history, these are the facts and facts suck when you're wrong, anti-american pukes,

(2) The U.S. reverts to true neutrality, aiding neither side. 

In this case, the U.K. almost certainly would sue for peace by 1941, to avoid being starved out by the U-boat attacks. A peace treaty would have been favored by Hitler, stripping the U.K. of most of the British Empire - thus, Germany would have ended up with practically all of British possessions in Africa (most critically, Egypt and the Suez, plus the Arabian oil fields), while Japan takes all of British Asia and likely India (though probably not Australia). 

With the added material resources of the former British Empire, and a ""winner's"" glow, several other (formerly neutral) countries would likely have thrown in on the Axis side, in what would have become labeled a ""anti-Bolshevik"" crusade. Russia is unlikely to have been able to survive a multi-front war (assuming the Japanese would now enter the war against the U.S.S.R.), and a bolstered Wehrmacht would almost certainly have been able to retain all of Western Russia. 

The result here would be a clear Axis victory, with the end of the British Empire, the partition of Russia, and an expansive German and Japanese empires.

They took out most of are industrial plants and companies that manufacture there own stuff and, closed down all mom and pop stores, replacing them with made in china...shit... monster stores. And are now buying  up all the natural resources like Northern Canada oil sands and coal companies throwout the would. we must make a stand one again before we all are undermined by greed and corruption.

And about American education: Only half know that the sun is a star and americans have an average of 10p lower IQ than Europeans (88-98 if i remember correctly) Im not sayin that there aint any smart Americans, im just sayin there are alot of dumb ones :D

,kazin223,2012-09-17T08:39Z,"@91cabo15 So what you're saying is that americans are ""dumb"" while in the same breath, committing murder on the english language as a whole? Also, despite your pro-british almost incoherent dribble, you sound like a redneck from texas. Not the stuck up european slob that you seem to be trying to emulate.

Also, with a country leading in both obesity in men and obesity in women, as well as having one of the highest mortality rates from heart disease, you'd think such a damn smart country would learn to lay off the mcdonalds(Also, your women need chastity belts too, so they stop getting raped all the time).

,sailorvsshark,2012-09-17T23:53Z,"@rush

""these are the facts""

Are they? I suggest you check a dictionary. American or British English will do.

What you have listed is some hypothetical outcomes of an alternate reality. 

So, you can predict a scenario in the past, from a period in time when you probably weren't born.

That's cool, your powers must mean you can look at the world's current geopolitical challenges, predict all potential outcomes, and inform the relevant organizations of the best course of action.

Skillz.
