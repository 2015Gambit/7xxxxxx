,Maplewood24,2012-07-31T19:19Z,best one they have out v/8 a/7 Thankx froggie100
,wendelj,2012-07-31T19:27Z,Can somebody comment on this. I'm at work and I can't torrent on this connection. Not sure I believe this first post. 
,realmov,2012-07-31T19:52Z,"well there are no seeders. as soon as i get seeders and download, i will give an honest a/v rating"
,reowner,2012-07-31T20:47Z,needs seeders
[T],FrodooBagginz,2012-07-31T21:57Z,Meh. This isn't that much better than the other source. 
[T],FrodooBagginz,2012-07-31T22:01Z,"Also, got info from someone that this is not really a new source....just a cropped version of the same source already out."
,williebk,2012-07-31T22:28Z,"I've been in the game since the late 70's computer era and this isn't a new source. Same ol' blurry tired out copy. At lease be honest man, cause your always bitchin bout negative comments."
,room237,2012-08-01T00:16Z,The Dark Cam Rises...my blood pressure. 
,Bad_Replicant,2012-08-01T00:18Z,"It *is* a new source... for the most part. A few scenes from the last cam are spliced in here and there. The new stuff is sharper and less murky, though some of the screen is missing. 

Any idea when the 720p version will hit, froggie?"
[T],FrodooBagginz,2012-08-01T01:09Z,"My bad...Bad_Replicant is right. The older source went out of focus quite a few times during the movie and this one does not.

So this is indeed a new source. Although clarity is better, the overall quality hasn't really improved all that much."
,Gnuber,2012-08-01T03:30Z,this cut is infinitely better than the others! thanks froggie!
,MyKrossini,2012-08-01T05:35Z,"@ williebk: For being in the ""game"" since the late 70's computer era you sure don't have any idea what you are talking about. I do like though how you threw out that completely irrelevant piece of information like it has anything to do with identifying the source of this file. And you were wrong anyway. Good job buddy. Maybe next time keep your irrelevant incorrect comments to yourself? Bad_Replicant is correct. New source, not that much better than the rest but still the best copy out so far. a/v/ 6/5"
,rezabrando,2012-08-01T06:42Z,"Well, new does not mean better. Although overall picture quality is slightly better, but it's cropped to fill a 16:9 screen. Which is a crime.

So, overall is worst than the previous one."
,Silencer7,2012-08-01T09:13Z,"@MyKrossini, ""not that much better than the rest but still the best copy out so far""

Ya."
,Silencer7,2012-08-01T11:27Z,"I'll go out on a limb, and split the difference, somewhere around:

V - 6 / A - 7  (for a CAM.)  (Best out so far.)

M - @9.6"
,Nogyy,2012-08-01T12:39Z,"Most times i can't watch cam torrents because of the horrible quality, but i figured i go ahead and give this a try. To my surprise this is actually pretty watchable. Many thanks froggie and good job.

,NoFatChx,2012-08-02T01:19Z,"MUCH better source then the others on here. This one is actually watchable.

The other one was so blurry I didn't know who was who.

,SignificantOther,2012-08-02T03:20Z,"Finally!!! A watchable cam of the movie with pretty respectable sound, although ever so slightly out of sync from time to time. Thanks froggie100 it's great to finally be able to watch this after the crap all the wannabes have been uploading."
,trenken,2012-08-02T04:26Z,This version is trash. It literally only has some new source footage and a lot of the old crappy source. People should just be banned from using torrent sites for pulling bullshit stunts like this.
,Lividicus,2012-08-02T06:53Z,"Howdy Howdy... I'm going to put things in perspective... 
The ""Cam"" Audio/Video I would give a 5/5. In comparison to a DVD quality Rip I give it a 3/3. It is (of course in my opinion) UNWATCHABLE. I watch on my laptop which most of the time helps vs. streaming to my TV, and it is BAD. VERY blurry, Does not do this movie justice in any way, shape, or form. If you are DYING to watch, WAIT, believe me, it's worth it! "
,Lividicus,2012-08-02T06:57Z,"P.S.

Thanks Froggie for the up! Don't think that because I don't believe it is watchable that I don't appreciate your ups! I'll definately be seeding the crap out of your HD cam when its uploaded :)"

Under Uploader, (the right column,) look for peean91.  Those are OK, but get OOS, slightly ahead, maybe in the middle, or else my vlc lost track as I skipped around.  Anyway GL, maybe try the others too, they're in different languages.

:o)"
,wendelj,2012-08-02T14:42Z,Take this shit upload down. Hollywood has thrown up some many junk/fake uploads they are winning.

On the contrary. It's you who should be banned for leaving dumb comments like that. And learn what 'literally' means."

,HelloMynameisV,2012-08-03T03:51Z,"Best version yet, thank you for the effort but THe audio keeps going out of synch and I just can't watch it! (on xbox) "
,saskrotch,2012-08-03T10:02Z,"is this an edit between multiple versions? It seems like the quality changes every few minutes. Edits are kind of jumpy, audio skips in a few places. Or is it just my computer?"
,JAG_ACE,2012-08-03T21:22Z,"For a Cam recording with low quality video (usually), why cant the file sizes be smaller around 700 meg? I have DVD rips full surround sound audio at 700 meg that are great quality, how cam we NOT fit a cam in a smaller container?

I seem to have missed that bit of info. could someone please enlighten me."
,phat_71,2012-08-04T00:33Z,"Why do people ALWAYS complain about the quality? What the hell do you idiots actually expect to find with a film recorded with a camcorder (regardless of how good it may be) from a screen at a movie theater. The actual graphical quality of the theater screens really isn't that great compared to what you can get at home.

Seriously if you can't just appreciate the effort and the fact that you got something for free then you should either go to the theater or wait for the DVD, it's pretty simple.


Anyway, among cam copies this one is very good. I've seen dozens of cam movies over the years, and there are a huge percentage that have worse quality than this. As for audio, it's probably among the best I've heard in a cam version yet. It's clearly and actually maintains it's range of frequency, the bass is actually there and sounds fine!"
,reowner,2012-08-04T01:23Z,still waiting for 720p with 5.1 line.
,Svajone,2012-08-04T11:53Z,It all went downhill after brokeback joker. I liked this third one. But it still didn't erase the travesty of the 2nd one. 
,hunter456,2012-08-04T12:24Z,5865
,phlyerfan28,2012-08-04T17:52Z,"@svajone
Are you retarded. Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker was Oscar worthy. In fact the whole dark Knight was. In my opinion it was the best movie out of all three and was sort of like its own story line because it broke away from the league of shadows and gave us the show down between the joker and batman."
,rezabrando,2012-08-04T19:24Z,"@reowner

Never gonna happen. You have to wait until december for the blu-ray."
,Xodiz,2012-08-04T19:26Z,"@svajone
Oh my God I didn't think anyone was so retarded to thing that Heath Ledger did a bad job playing The Joker. His performance was amazing. If anything the Dark Knight series has gone uphill every time......oh and also fuck you!! "
,MC_Baby_Farts,2012-08-05T06:00Z,"@svajone

I agree with your statement. Heath Ledger's terrible performance resulted in his death. His ex said shortly after he died he was depressed and killed himself, lol good thing we wont have to see any more of his shitty movies :p"

,Obido,2012-08-14T16:28Z,"I'm not used to watching TS/CAM rips. But I gotta say that the quality is much better than I expected. 

I definitely recommend this to those who need to watch TDKR, but doesn't have the means or will to watch it in theaters a second or third (or more) time(s) and doesn't have the patience to wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray release.

Quality (for being ts)
A/8
V/6"
,boondall,2012-08-16T06:29Z,watched it in the theater . not that great IMO. wait for a DVD rip and watch on a big TV. u wont be missing much. even a good cam will suffice.
