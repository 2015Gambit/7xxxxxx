If you have a smartphone or tablet u can use the AR app on the cover and it gives a ""Last time on dragonball Z"" type deal...but this is the digital version and not a scan so no AR feature. U might get the jist of what happened...but yea you'll be lost if you dont read from at least 4 on. 

This event starts out slow as shit"
,nadroj321,2012-08-02T08:18Z,"mirrormaster, or perhaps someone else can link me to the torrents, I already have that 2gig one and a couple of singles and volume 9, but we haven't had a solid upload of all modern marvel what-ifs. If someone could take on the task, I'd be eternally grateful."
,Rizzle033,2012-08-02T08:37Z,"nadroj321, MrDowntown is probably the uploader with the best resources. I believe he has a very large collection, so he might be able to help you out a bit."
