Description: Borderlands - it is quite successful attempt to cross a role-playing game Diablo-style with a first-person shooter. The plot unfolds in a post-apocalyptic setting, and the lessons we should expect quite familiar: Unpretentious perform quests, looking for a mysterious bunker, destroying thousands of monsters and, of course, carefully pumps and ekipiruem his hero. Mostly the game is far from ideal - so she did not have enough of a more powerful story - but clearly Borderlands munchkins will love.
