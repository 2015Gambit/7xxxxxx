Lord, the things you have to do to get noticed these days. Surely a title like that will have you porn-hounds clicking on the button. And it's FRENCH (sort of). Zut alors!

This is actually a domestic melodrama about a daughter's attempt to relate to her father, who is not the man she once knew. There's a lot more going on beneath the surface, but it would probably go unnoticed by "maudits anglais".

PS This is a ROTTEN copy, ripped from tape - I hope to provoke someone into putting up a better one.
