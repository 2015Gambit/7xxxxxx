,nikita566,2012-08-01T16:43Z,"Thanks, as always. You're the man!!!"
,nikita566,2012-08-01T16:45Z,"Hey Nepotu, it's Nikita. Hope you are well.

Is there a chance to get the USA women's team games?

Thanks"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-01T18:18Z,"you're welcome. What game do you want, Nikita? I'll up for you"
,biggybo,2012-08-01T18:55Z,Nepotu what is this? >_> its not even 720p and i'm having problems playing it in MPC and VLC :( 
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-01T20:28Z,"Biggybo, I played with BSPlayer and works pretty fine, and the player says it is 1280x720 at 25fps"
,user-123456,2012-08-02T00:46Z,Boxee and VLC both choke on these files. VLC will sorta play it but the aspect ratio is off and it's very blocky and jittery.
,treecheetaholo,2012-08-02T00:50Z,"Im having trouble with this too, it doesnt work in MPC. Now what crap video file doesnt work in MPC?"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-02T02:48Z,"You have to adjust the aspect ratio at 16:9. It's very easy. If you don't do that then it seems to do like you said. To me worked perfect, without any problem (but first I forced the aspect ratio 16:9)."
,nikita566,2012-08-02T07:52Z,"Hi Nepotu. I was out late, could not respond until now, sorry. If you could also upload from now on all the USA women's basketball, that would be great.

Thanks.

For all you losers ragging on Nepotu about these files, be grateful and shut up. You can mention problems, but not berate the guy, he's doing us all a favor.
