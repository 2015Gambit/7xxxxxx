Installation Steps
1.	Uninstall previous versions of ArcGIS, erase any traces too (use CCleaner to clean registry, delete ESRI/ArcGIS folders in Program Files, Appdata, ProgramData, etc)
2.	Install ArcGIS 10.1 without License Manager
3.	Install Pre-Release License Manager
4.	Use Keygen to create license file, set version to 10.1
5.	Replace text in ...ArcGISLicense10.1binservice.txt with generated text
6.	Adjust host and port values as needed in text (change port if running other FlexLM managers!)
7.	Run LSAdmin, reread license file if needed
8.	Run ArcGIS Administrator, check ArcInfo Concurrent License"
,tomassta,2012-08-07T17:44Z,"Hi med2003. 

I've tried your crack and I have questions:

Step 4 (Keygen):
-Is the ""HostID"" supposed to be the computer-Name (or the physical Address) ?
-Do we have to leave the ""Licenses"" value to 2048 (or change it ?) ?
-Which ""Feature"" value do we have to select? (ARC/INFO or ArcInfo ?)
-Concerning the ""Version"", there's no 10.1 option in the combobox, do we have to enter ""10.1"" manually?

Step6: Where do we have to adjust the ""Host"" ?

Step7: When I start the license service using ArcGis License Server Administrator (LSAdmin) to re-read the license, it doesn't work (Lisence Statut: NOT RUNNING)...

Thanks a lot for your work, hope the crak works !"
,brisk00,2012-08-08T01:02Z,crack plz.  brisk00@aol.com
,med2003,2012-08-08T09:01Z,"4 - don't write anything in HostID, the crack 'l wite , localhost or this_host.... the service.txt must begin with : START_LICENSE
SERVER this_host ANY 27000
VENDOR ARCGIS
4a- ArcInfo 
4b- type/change 10.1 manually
6-nothing to do..BUT..If you are running other software that uses FlexLM, set the port to something other than 27000 in the text file, eg. 27027.
7- this is the big problem ! I resolved it, In deed, you must uninstall licence manager, reinstall it and DO NOT CLOSE IT, leave the window opened and the licence running, do not touch it , run the crack (while the llicence manager is opened and showing the licence working), apply the crack and make all changes while it is RUNNING..."
,brisk00,2012-08-08T13:53Z,Can't get it to work either. Says flexnet licensing error. Host name and license path not set.
,med2003,2012-08-08T16:51Z,"Don't touch flexnet !!!!
 uninstall licence manager
reinstall it
when the window licence is opened, let it as it's
don't close it
run the crack and change manually from 10.0 to 10.1
copy the service txt
Run LSAdmin, reread license file if needed
Run ArcGIS Administrator, check ArcInfo Concurrent License"
,tomassta,2012-08-08T21:05Z,"Hi med2003, 

I've uninstalled License manager and re-installed it. 

At the end of the install, the ""ArcGis License Server Administrator - 10.1"" window opened. 

The ""license Server Status"" at the bottom of the window was ""NOT RUNNING"". 

I left this window opened and replaced my ""Service.txt"" file in the bin folder (using the crack set as you mentionned in your previous post). 

Then I ran the ""LSAdmin.exe"" and clicked on the ""Start"" button (the ""Re-resad"" button was greyed). 

The ""License server status"" didn't change (still ""NOT RUNNING"".

Then I ran the ""ArcGis Administrator"" and checked the ""Advanced (ArcInfo) Concurent Use""  box"".  I changed the License Manager to ""localhost""

Still not working. 

Don't know what's wrong.... frustrating !

Thx"
,med2003,2012-08-08T23:47Z,"I think, if you perform a clean uninstall of licence manager  and reinstall it, you shouldn't have the problem

At the end of the install, the ""ArcGis License Server Administrator - 10.1"" window qhould be opened and the ""license Server Status"" at the bottom of the window should be ""RUNNING"".

if it's not running, it means there's a problem !!!
don't clik on read/rerad... have you install the licence manager on another pc ? and see if it's running ?"

,Bazza22,2012-08-13T05:46Z,"Thanks med2003 - Awesome! 

I got it to to work with a slight change to the installation procedure. 

1 - Install  Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1;
2 - install license manager and leave running;
3 - Go to service.txt file (which lives in C:Program Files (x86)ArcGISLicense10.1bin); 
4 - Open the service.txt file and save to desktop; 
5 - Run the Keygen. Make sure that ""feature"" is set to ArcINFO and edit the ArcGIS version property to 10.1 (just highlight and type 10.1); 
6 - Click the 'all' tab, highlight all the info and copy to the service.txt on the desktop. Open this file and change the ""host"" to the name of the computer that you are using;
7- Copy and paste the file back to C:Program Files (x86)ArcGISLicense10.1bin (choose replace the file at the prompt!);
8 - Install ArcGIS and all extensions. 
9 - Once installed, the ArcGIS Administrator should open, choose Advanced (ArcInfo)  Concurrent use, Click the ""Change"" tab under Licence manager and change to your computer name. Click on the ""availability"" tab in the left column and all the licences added from the keygen should be there.

DON'T look in the ""License Server Administrator"" for the licenses - they are not there! Look in the ""ArcGIS Administrator"". I think that is where everyone has been confused. In fact, I found this crack to be easier than the 9.3 version!"
,mof77,2012-08-13T08:12Z,"Thanks Bazza22 for solving the confusion.
Special Thanks to med2003!

9 - Once installed, the ArcGIS Administrator should open, choose Advanced (ArcInfo) Concurrent use, Click the ""Change"" tab under Licence manager and change to your computer name. Click on the ""availability"" tab in the left column and all the licences added from the keygen should be there.

=> Where do I find the ""Change"" tab at the License Manager? Because my License Server Administrator doesn't show any Change tab/button.

Thanks once again for your support."
,med2003,2012-08-13T08:15Z,"Many thanks Bazza22

Hope everything goes well for everyone"
,tomassta,2012-08-13T17:18Z,"Still not working...

As mentionned by Bazza, I first install the license manager (before ArcGIS Desktop)

1/ When The ""licence manager"" install is finished, do I have to click on the ""Finish"" button (or leave the window opened) (If I click on the ""finish"" button, the ""ArcGIS License Server Administrator - 10.1"" window opens. The ""License Server Status"" at the bottom of the window says: ""NOT RUNNING"". ArcGis Desktop is still not installed, only the license manager).

2/ Bazza, on your 6- you ask to change the ""host"" by the computer name. Isn't it ""this_host"" ?

When I open the ""service.txt"" file, I have the following: 

START_LICENSE
SERVER this_host ANY 27000
VENDOR ARCGIS

Do we have to change ""this_host"" by our computer Name ?

3/ I've noticed that when I leave the ""Host_Id"" field empty in the Keygen window, it generates the following text: 

START_LICENSE
SERVER this_host ANY 27000
VENDOR ARCGIS

But when I enter ""Test"" in the ""Host_Id"" field for instance, it generates something different: 

START_LICENSE
SERVER this_host ESRI_SENTINEL_KEY=Test 27000
VENDOR ARCGIS

Which one do we have to use?

Thanks again for your help. "
,med2003,2012-08-13T19:44Z,"tomassta : from "" my experience "" :

- do not click on the ""Finish"" button
- leave the window opened

-do not change ""this_host""
- leave : this_host ANY 27000"
,tomassta,2012-08-14T01:03Z,"Yeah, it works. 

The problem actually comes from my comuter. I've tried to install it on another computer (no any previous installation of ArGIS) and it worked (first installation, following med 2003 and Bazza22 instructions (thx again guys). 

So I have to figure out why it doesn't work on my computer. I've tried to completely remove ArcGIS 10 before installing 10.1 (used Ccleaner, did a registry clean up, deleted any ArcGis, ESRI, etc. folder in Program files, appData, etc.)

I must have left some traces of the previous installatin (ArcGIS 10). 

Do you guys know how to do a clean remove of arcGis 10 before installing 10.1

Thx. "
,Bazza22,2012-08-14T04:06Z,"tomassta - I had problems removing all the ArcGIS 9.3 licence manager files. I had to re install the licence manager and uninstall it again to remove all traces. Until I did this I couldn't install 10.1 Licence manager.... Also, I had to manually delete files under the ESRI folder that weren't being removed. 

The confusing bit in all this is that there is a ""License server administrator"" and ""ArcGIS administrator!"" Install the ""License server administrator"" and check to see if it is ""running"" and do nothing else with it! 

The ""ArcGIS administrator"" which is installed with the actual ArcGIS program looks at the ""service.txt"" file to obtain the licenses. I changed ""this_host"" to the name of my computer and found that it worked. But as med2003 states, you probably don't have to do this? I am guessing that if you change the name to the name of the computer, the ArcGIS administrator is looking at the computer name as the server.....

As with all of this - trial and error!

Cheers
"
,Bazza22,2012-08-14T04:14Z,"mof77 - The ""Change"" tab is in the ""ArcGIS administrator"", open the desktop folder on the left column and the ""License manager (for concurrent use software products) section is on the right. under this, there is a change tab. When this is clicked, your computer name should appear and select this! Now click on the availability folder and in theory, all the licenses should appear. "
,mof77,2012-08-14T08:02Z,"Bazza22 - ""Change"" tab Still Not Found.
After ArcGIS installation, a dialogue box comes with message ""ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop has been successfully installed"". Click finish to exit the installation. When I click Finish button, ArcGIS Administrator Wizard dialogue box opens with these options:
1- Select a product
I select Advanced (ArcInfo) Concurrent Use
then second option becomes active
2- Define a License Manager for concurrent use products.... Browse

There isn't any Left and Right column.
Please guide..

Many thanks."
,Bazza22,2012-08-16T00:43Z,"mof77 - you are correct. I was trying to remember what happened after the install as I knew a dialogue box appeared! Both the options that you state are correct and in theory the program should work. I think between us all, we will get it sorted eventually!"
