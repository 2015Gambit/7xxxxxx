,dincity,2012-07-31T08:04Z,"quote from AOTS 6.25 UL: Alright everyone, Everything good must come to an end. July will be my last month for capping / encoding. Work and real life is why I can no longer continue. These past few weeks I haven't even had time to watch the show only the live show on my days off from work. It's Been a good run."
