,aallain,2012-08-06T08:25Z,"Hi, I'm the author of this book. I worked on this book every single day for over two years and released it DRM-free to make it convenient for my readers. I sell the book directly through my site, http://www.cprogramming.com/c++book/ -- proceeds from the sale don't go through a middle man, they go directly to support the creation of this and future works, including all the free articles and tutorials at cprogramming.com. Instead of downloading the torrent, please consider reading the sample chapter at http://www.cprogramming.com/c++book/sample.pdf and then buy the book at my website if you like it. It would mean a lot to me."
