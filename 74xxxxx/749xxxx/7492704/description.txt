This workshop contains 7- hour lecture and a 100-page handbook.
The material gives an overview of contemporary Angelic and ET contact 
and addresses common questions like: Who are the Visitors? 
Where do they come from?  Why have they returned?

Discussion points and quotes from the workshop include:

 A'shayana's (Speaker One's) childhood experiences in inter-dimensional contact. ΓùÅ Taking steps in protecting oneself from adverse ET contact begins with knowing WHO you are/ your True nature. ΓùÅ Being empowered is about being able to look at the good, the bad and everything in between and make a choice. ΓùÅ True evolved Beings: if you have an advantage you help others to have that advantage too. ΓùÅ We need to re-evolve rather than revolt: re-evolution rather than revolution! ΓùÅ Only empowered individuals have the power to begin shifting what's happening on a mass level here.
