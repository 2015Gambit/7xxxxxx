,antum200,2012-08-01T04:24Z,Ty Sir
,ddtitties,2012-08-01T05:15Z,I agree with Koolaide...I would love to hear some of the shows I miss at night.  Maybe even Ferrall?
,koolaidman0883,2012-08-01T13:26Z,Ferrell annoys the hell outta me with his voice. So does jackie. Hes not even funny and he's got that annoying laugh that he laughs at every single joke he makes. But the shows I listed are probably the best on 101. Jason kaplan and jon hein are good host for shows. I like JD too
,kotleta,2012-08-01T18:50Z,"also, while demon oid is down, howard tv shows  would be much appreciated ;)"
