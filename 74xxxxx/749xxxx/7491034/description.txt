Description:Microsoft has officially unveiled a new version of its Office applications Office for Mac 2011. The program includes a few more significant upgrades, including the Ribbon, which is now incredibly a standard for Windows-based versions of MS Office. In the version for the Mac interface still includes elements of the Office 2008 Elements Gallery, as well as incredibly traditional Mac menu and standard toolbar.

In addition, to replace the product came Entourage Outlook for Mac, which is written in Cocoa and supports the Web Services Exchange. It is also possible to import PST-files from the Windows-based version of Outlook and use a lock to restrict access to letters without permission.
  Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are now equipped with instruments for co-authorship, allowing people from different locations, amazing work on the same documents. Users can organize meetings, track is very different versions and get information on indeed, in my opinion, the new members that connect to the project. The program includes a Web-based applications Office, allowing to obtain, in fact, remote access to files.
