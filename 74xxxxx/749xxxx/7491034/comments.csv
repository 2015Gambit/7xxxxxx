,boogerpdx,2012-08-20T00:45Z,Installed without a hitch to my Mac Mini running 10.8. Just remember to allow your computer to accept unidentified developers because gatekeeper has it set at Apple and known developers only. Go to pref pane>security&privacy>General>once there just unlock your permissions by selecting 'anywhere'.  Once the software installs change the permissions back to what they were for security reasons
