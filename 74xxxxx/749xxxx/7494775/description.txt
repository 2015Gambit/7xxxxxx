
Cambridge Companion to John Calvin [ENG] [PDF]


Dr Donald K. McKim gathers together an international array of major Calvin scholars to consider phases of Calvin's theological thought and influence. Here, historians and theologians meet to present a full picture of Calvin's contexts, the major themes in Calvin's writings, and the ways in which his thought spread and has increasing importance today. The chapters serve as guides to their topics and provide further readings for additional study. This is an accessible introduction to the significant Protestant reformer and will appeal to the specialist and non-specialist alike.
