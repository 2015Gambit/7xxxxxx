Description:

The Last Mountain:  
The fight for the last great mountain in America's Appalachian heartland pits the mining giant that wants to explode
it to extract the coal within, against the community fighting to preserve the mountain and build a wind farm on its
ridges instead. With Bobby Kennedy Jr. enlisted as a passionate force for preserving Coal River Mountain and the
economic power of the fossil fuel industry twisting democracy to its advantage THE LAST MOUNTAIN highlights a battle
for the future of energy that affects us all.

Synopsis: The mining and burning of coal is at the epicenter of America's struggle to balance its energy needs and environmental concerns, so the daring solution proposed by this small Appalachian community takes on national significance when Bobby Kennedy, Jr. joins the Appalachian families to fight the extraordinary and insidious power of Big Coal.

[size=18]JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
