,elangton2000,2012-07-31T06:57Z,Needs seeders.
,reowner,2012-07-31T08:32Z,how do u just download the sample?
,sissor,2012-07-31T08:37Z,"Just watched the sample. If the rest of the movie is like the sample then this is very promising and probably the best copy out yet.

A little blurry but a huge improvement over the other torrents out there."
,reowner,2012-07-31T08:42Z,well i just checked the sample and compared it with the same shit that has been going around and it's still the same source. thanks anyways but i'm still going to wait for a new source.
,elangton2000,2012-07-31T09:00Z,"It's not fake as the sample finished downloading and I watched it, but the speed has dropped down to .3 KB/s and the movie is only at 4%. It's also not the same source as it is a higher resolution at 720x300 where as the other source going around is 698x280."
,trenken,2012-07-31T15:05Z,Lol 5 seeders. This should only take a week to download.
,jenistos,2012-07-31T15:52Z,"@sissor: Best copy out yet? WRONG!

It's still the same CAM source (26K) ... just like the rest of the TDKR torrents so far."
,wendelj,2012-07-31T16:33Z,Hollywood must be spending heavy $$$ on movie theater narcs because this single shit copy is very sad. Very strange. 
,filmsmnia,2012-07-31T16:35Z,it's not fake ! you can download it 
,DreaD151,2012-07-31T16:39Z,no ones gonna get it the connection is constipated with people ....one by one eveyone needs to cancel the torrent and and let some people seed after the seed count goes up try again lettin it sit there not downloading or slow wont work the seed to leech ratio is horrible .....
,trenken,2012-07-31T17:12Z,"We know it isnt fake, but its the same crap source as the only other legit one. Theaters are obviously using those new methods of catching these guys so after over a week we still only have 1 real source."
,sissor,2012-07-31T21:56Z,"@jenistos

No I think you're wrong. I've downloaded several of the cams and ""telesyncs"" that have been floating around and this one looks much better. 

I don't know what you must be smoking but it must be some awesome shit."
,arslanistic,2012-07-31T22:23Z,"i cant find any english subs for this movie.. and the audio is just too crappy to understand [in the version i downloaded, not this one] someone plz help with those.."
,frailwordscollapse,2012-08-01T05:28Z,"I'd recommend to everyone that instead of downloading this, wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray version to come out. All cam rips are horrible quality and defeat the purpose of home media.

On the other hand, if you can't wait to masturbate over Catwoman, then by all means, download this."
,rossipoo3,2012-08-05T06:00Z,every time i try to download it get to .04% and the says writetodisk: access denied... please help what do i do?
