As the leaflet says,This Album was recorded in 1973 for a movie by Ramesh Khosla.The music was scored by music maestro Jaidev , while the lyrics for four songs were penned by poet par excellence Kaifi Azmi.The songs were sung by Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar and Legendary Late Mukesh . These are the last known songs of Late Mukesh to be released.

The movie never happened.and then in 1997,his son Robin Khosla , revived the project and started developing the movie "CHAND GRAHAN" . He also recorded another song with Asha Bhosle.

But Fate had decided something else for this project and due to unforseen circumstances,it failed to finish again.Unconfirmed though but later this album was used in a project for television.

A project that involved JAIDEV,KAIFI AZMI.LATA MANGESHKAR,MUKESH AND LATER ASHA BHOSLE was for sure to become a blockbuster. but who can fight Destiny.
