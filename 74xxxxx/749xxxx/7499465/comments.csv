,GIANNIS511,2012-08-03T06:45Z,Many times Marvel Calendar is wrong so don't trust it very much. 
,ecowfer13,2012-08-03T07:41Z,Fury Max is just a mini-series...#5 should be the last issue unless I'm mistaken (which happens really frequently).
,sixor12,2012-08-03T20:27Z,"I was waiting for Hulk #56 myself.
Yeah Demonoid is going to be missed if it doesn't make it back.
Is anyone using z-cult?"
,Dancer77,2012-08-04T14:47Z,what is z cult?
,akv2012,2012-08-04T15:25Z,"Great work FLSM79.. We have a DC weekly release for all new 52 titles, but not for marvel so far. btw, I feel the best source for finding the comics coming out each week is comiclist -http://www.comiclist.com/index.php

comicvine does not always contain all titles updated in its new comics section imo."
,redscorpion25,2012-08-17T08:48Z,you are the best :)
