Btw, could you upload sharapova vs Lisicki Olympic Third Round??? They didn't stream the court 1 on TV in my country....plz"
[T],theburningbush,2012-08-05T15:35Z,"I second the request for the third-round Sharapova-Lisicki match. For some bizarre reason, this is the one women's singles match unavailable at www.nbcolympics.com/tennis/event/women-singles/phase=tew001400/ , and trying to find a torrent of it has been fruitless as well. Multiple commentators have reported that it was an outstanding match."
