TotalFinder is just a better Finder


TotalFinder works like the original Finder but adds tabs, dual panel, folders on top and other useful features.
My goal is to improve Finder in areas where it is lacking but keep the overall design which is good in my opinion.
TotalFinder works in OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Some features are also available in OSX 10.7 (Lion).

Whats New
Version 1.3.13:
FIXED TotalFinder renders nicely on Retina MacBooks (issue)
FIXED Visor auto-slides down when Finder loses active status. This should fix unreliable sliding historicaly based on losing keyboard focus (issue).
FIXED No ghost windows after restarting (when Visor was pinned and up before restart).
IMPROVED Prevents visual artifacts during Expose.
