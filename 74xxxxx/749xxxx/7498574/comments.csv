I made a request for James Herriot books and Oliver Strange books... Hope you will include them in one of your future upoads... Thanks in advance."
,kittu1953,2012-08-03T04:05Z,"Sorry about my previous comment... I saw your Flood #11 before I saw #flood 10. Since I did not see James Herriot in Flood #11, I thought of requesting you again... I got James Herriot in #flood 10... Thanks a lot for that... Please upload Oliver Strange if you have it... "

The Herriot books are in Book Flood #10. I don't know about the other author. I'm a big Herriot fan so it caught my attention."

You call the shots by Cameron Johnson, Nothing to lose everything to gain by Ryan Blair and A million bucks by 30 by alan corey? I couldn't afford these books. Thank you so much! "
