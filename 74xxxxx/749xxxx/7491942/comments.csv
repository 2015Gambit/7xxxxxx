Once completed, this set showed up as [Met-Art] Michaela A - carduus [x111] 2048px with no file extension. Guessing it would obviously be a zip file, I added the .zip to the file name, then was able to unzip it and all was well. If anyone has a reason for this, please post here and i'll swing back and check for a reply. Cheers"

PC v. Mac?"
