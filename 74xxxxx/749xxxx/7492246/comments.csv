,bernard75,2012-08-03T01:34Z,"bullshit!
there is just one activation key, which works with ONE hardware code.
save your time and wait for an official skidrow release with a proper keygen"

,Spyguy27,2012-08-14T12:59Z,it will not work without a hardware ID because your activation code is generated according to the hardware ID. i have tried all the keys provided. it does not work. work on a crack
