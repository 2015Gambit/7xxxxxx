Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 is a strange and wonderful trip into an anime adventure. YouΓÇÖre an orphaned high school student, transferred to Gekkoukan High School on Port Island. After arriving, heΓÇÖs attacked by creatures known as Shadows. The assault awakens his Persona, Orpheus, from the depths of his subconscious, enabling him to defeat the terrifying foes. He soon discovers that he shares this special ability with other students at his new school. From them, he learns of the Dark Hour, a hidden time that exists between one day and the next, swarming with Shadows. Under the supervision of school chairman Shuji Ikutsuki, he joins his new companions in confronting this threat to humanity. With your school as the primary battlefield, youΓÇÖll be forced to juggle two lives: Student by day, defender by night.
And your greatest challenges await you on the eve of each full moon.
