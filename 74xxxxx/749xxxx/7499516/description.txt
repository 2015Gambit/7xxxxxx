These books have been painstakingly converted from poorly formatted text files into the .epub formats that they are currently in. I attempted to remove as many errors in scanning as possible, but surely with the mass quantity, many have likely slipped by me. However, the books are in a condition that they should be completely readable, without the errors ruining the overall enjoyment of the book

If you find any errors, simply e-mail me at ezebooks2012@gmail.com.  Include the book name, chapter number, and as much information about the area with the error as possible. Copying down the sentence is best as I can use a search function to locate the error.

Types of errors include:
     - Paragraphs which have not been broken up when speaker changes
     - Paragraphs which need to be re-joined (i.e. ends in the middle of a sentence)
     - Missing speech marks
     - Speech mark scanning errors (sometimes the scanner picks up a 'I as a T or a 'I in italics as a 7)
     - Missed sections of text (hard to know unless you've read the book or there is an obvious jump in plot...should not be present in any of the books)
     - Incorrectly scanned sections of text (I think I got all of these, but if you see a section that is all symbols, it's likely not what the author was thinking.)
     - Page numbers within the text (I believe I nabbed most of them)

Again that e-mail is ezebooks2012@gmail.com

Thanks for your help and enjoy these fantastic novels.
