Description:
Escape From Darkness By A Former Islamic Political Leader In Iran:
Daniel Shayesteh was many things: * Radical Muslim * Active militant * Iranian fundamentalist * Death row inmate...

... but today, Daniel is a born-again Christian! He travels throughout the world revealing the actual teachings of the QuranΓÇöIslams holy bookΓÇöand shines light on the truth of the Bible. Watch this informative, illustrated testimony as he shares his miraculous escape from darkness. Its time to understand Islam! Daniel Shayesteh, a former Islamic political leader in IranΓÇöand militaristic trainer of Muslims committed to the extermination of Christians and JewsΓÇöis now a dedicated, committed Bible-believing Christian. I first knew Daniel in Turkey in 1989 and 1990 as a new believer in Christ. Since that time, I have consistently witnessed Gods wonderful grace in his life. Daniel, through Gods amazing grace now has an effective, world-wide Christian ministry! Rev. Allyn Huntzinger, Executive Vice-President of Christar, Reading, PA


Islam Prophesied In The Bible:
Walid Shoebat preaches regarding Islam and it's prophetic significance in the Bible. This was filmed at Koinonia Institute's 2008 Strategic Perspectives conference in Southern California hosted by Dr. Chuck Missler.


The Islamic Connection to Rome:
Islam "has a very high standard of what is right or what is wrong" MEANS just that.  Anyone may have high standards, BUT that does not make them Correct. Truth = truth, high standards for such does NOT make it TRUTH; acquired thru one's learning & experience.  There lies the deception.
