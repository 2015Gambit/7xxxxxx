""Sources Used: Video-Russian Cam....Audio- Tooth fairy? Thanks!
This is the new cropped video, nicer than last one except for the crop...Anyway, 
took the vid and tried to tighten resolution abit, and get an acceptable balance of 
lights/darks. I lowered sat, played with rgb, gamma, hue some, ran denoiser and a 
slight smooth lastly.....good as I can get it..Came out pretty nice imho..Audio was 
good, but I wanted to make it really good, so I did my usual of tricks and tweaks. 
Re-mixed both channels, and brought the soundtrack to life. Then I made sure that 
the low/high levels were where they should be. Then took out the bit of hiss, 
cleaned low Hz levels to filter out distortion and set up PM-EQ to balance it out, 
then beefed up overall track by 10db..Made the audio 5.1 to truly get the full sound. 
Clean and powerful....Bass hits very nice and clean for ur subs! Had to make about 6 
cuts on audio to sync it to video properly..came out perty good imo. I did 3 
samples to give u a wide range of day/night scenes, the music, and dialog..enjoy, 
hope this makes someone happy...Thanks to all my peeps!
 Much Respect from the Batman.{ I mean Devilman!}""

,tosem,2012-08-03T13:47Z,"Downloaded it, skipped here and there... Awful quality, to be honest. Blurry and dark, cropped so much that the picture has become quite long and narrow. Plus, the audio is out of sync for almost the entire movie... I won't watch it, neither would I advise anyone to do it. Wait for a better copy. ;-)"
