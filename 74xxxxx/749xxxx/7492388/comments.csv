“Your “Guirtar Hero: Aerosmith” Play Diskc must be inserted before starting the game.”

Not sure how to fix this but I can’t get past it to play."
,goliretor,2012-08-01T10:37Z,"try to give step by step instructions

1.tear down the game CleanApp'om
2.toast disk image, mount
3.install the game
4.mount the image nodvd
5.run nodvd, patch Guitar Hero Aerosmith.app
6.can unmount the image of toast, and the 7.image nodvd
8.start the game and play

That's what I did at one time
  everything works so far and no complaints"
