Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, August 1 edition the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with former Wall Street stockbroker and filmmaker Max Keiser about the continuing implosion of the economy as the euro crisis plagues global economies, cuts factory and productive output, stimulates endemic joblessness, and the Federal Reserve warns the economy may be stuck in permanent slow growth. 

Alex also talks about increasing attacks on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- especially vicious attacks on the Second Amendment -- as the global elite prepare for the inevitability of mass unrest and the implementation of a police state.
