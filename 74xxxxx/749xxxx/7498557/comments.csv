I've seen B movie zombie films with no budget but this is simply bad. its obvious that a producer with money back this film (i.e. zombie makeup is good, guns and explosion everywhere, gorgeous female actresses) if only they spend some money on the script itself, then this film could atleast be a so-so film. if you want to waste an hour of your life, then dload the movie. my advise, just wait for walking dead season 3"

Aside from that the movie is pure crap.  This director thinks that Jump Cuts = action.  Very sad...

 Really it is nothing more than an FX demo.

A: 10
V: 6 (micro yet widescreen is pretty useless except on iPad turned sideways.
