You're both welcome :)
It says that there are no seeds and peers on this torrent, but I checked it on my end and there are currently 168. In fact, it says that everybody who has uploaded stuff for the last 20+ hours have no seeds or peers either! So, don't be put off by that. Gaz :)"
,sophvalo,2012-08-03T13:07Z,Hey I've been looking to download this series just wondering if you would be able to upload the compete season 1-5?
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-08-03T14:01Z,"It would take me too long to seed 5 seasons. It slows down my upload for the new episodes. You will find that there are still seeds on all the episodes of TOWIE which I have uploaded in the past. The first few seasons are under my original username ""GaryBradbury"". I know that they are individual files, but, it would be a lot faster for you too."
,djt067,2012-08-03T14:57Z,Anybody got any idea when season 3 of Mad Dogs will be out? A great series 1&2 surely there has to be a 3.  Any idea Gaz?
