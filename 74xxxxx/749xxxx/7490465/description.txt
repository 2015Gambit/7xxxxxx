Notes ....: The movie is based on the famous board game "Clue".Just like the 
            game, the movie has various different endings. For the initial 
            release we used the main ending on the disc, AKA "The Trilogy 
            Ending". The disc offers 3 additional alternative endings and we 
            thought it would be nice to make them available as well. Naturally  
            it would be stupid to pre the movie 4 times each resoltion, so we 
            instead encoded the 3 extra endings on their own.

            One can watch the full release and the different endings after 
            (the endings are from 1h19m0s), or use our merge script to create
            full versions of the movie, each with a different ending. We didn't
            size the endings to a specific target size, but used the same
            bitrate that was used for the full release to keep it consistent.
