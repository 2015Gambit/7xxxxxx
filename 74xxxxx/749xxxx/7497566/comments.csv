So this is my quick opinion on the movie.

Imdb rated this 5.6/10? I totally disagree with that, really should have been in the 7/10 range this movie is underrated. It's very original and trust me you will never guess what will happens next! It is a pretty good Mystery/thriller flick I would Highly recommend you to watch it!

M : 7.1

V / A : 8 / 8 - Very Good Quality Encode. If you compare it to Blu-Ray. I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for this encoder ""WatchMan"" in future :D

Thanks again for the share"
