Deckchairs Overboard hailed from Sydney, Australia and were active from 1982 to 1985. You can find videos on YouTube where you will see them try a variety of things to capture your attention, from the manic literal interpretation of the band name in "Thats The Way" to the use of McQuades legs in "Shout" to the moody stylings of "Walking in the Dark" (which is a standout hit on this album). It seems there were a multitude of other musicians over the bands few years of recording but only Clifforth and McQuade hung in there until 1985 when a full album was finally released. Great fun, very synth-poppy and a perfect "Why havent I heard this before" kind of album.
