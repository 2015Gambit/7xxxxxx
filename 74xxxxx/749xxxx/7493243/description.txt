NOTES:
We've long been putting off this release, but finally we got time
to drop this "PROPER" release. What we have done is to correct the
errors in the Swedish subtitles. At 164 different points was both
Swedish and Finnish subtitles showing, which we have removed so now
only the Swedish text is visible. This is an error that was made
from the producers so all retails have this annoying error.


Hopefully you will enjoy this awsome docu and try subutex!
