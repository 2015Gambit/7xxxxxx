IMPORTANT NOTICES:

> DRUGGED VERSIONS <
If you use a drugged GTA IV or EFLC, make sure you select Custom setup in the InstallShield Wizard.
Then, deselect DSound and GFWL Protection Enabler and select XLiveLess instead.
Otherwise, your game will CRASH!

> LAUNCHER <
We are now using a new system with multiple game types, which is handled by our Launcher.
This means, you MUST use the Launcher to start the mod. Otherwise, your game will CRASH!

> MULTIPLAYER <
To play multiplayer, you will need a LEGAL copy of GTA IV 1.0.7.0 or GTA EFLC 1.1.2.0.
Also make sure you use DSound and GFWL Protection Enabler. XLiveLess will not work, since we use the original GFWL multiplayer.
