MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR SAVES AND SCRIPTS AND STREAM FOLDERS!!!!


Installation:

1. Place Scripts folder and Stream folder into your Bully directory C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesBully Scholarship Edition (It will ask to overwrite click yes to all)

2. Place Bully Scholarship Edition folder into your documents folder (It contains the save needed to play as the character)

3. Launch the game and you will be playing as Mandy! 

Note: You can't change your clothes or you will turn into Jimmy and he will walk like a girl and all... yeah kinda weird lol! xD if you do accidentally change your clothes, just go to costumes and choose "Red Ninja Suit" and you will change back into Mandy

(The file is over a Gigabyte after you extract it with WINRar or whatever you use because the World.img file is huge and it is needed to replace the character model and to change most of Jimmy's voice into Mandy's voice)



This is my first torrent i hope you all enjoy the mod! (I'll check daily for comments if anyone needs help and I'll seed hopefully you seed too)
