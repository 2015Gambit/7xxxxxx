[T],azaq318,2012-08-02T00:53Z,"Guys, i don't even now, is it suppose to be that way... It's only like 1 level, after it the game requires STEAM connection... it has NO single campaign I guess ..."
,vladguy,2012-08-02T01:17Z,No seeds?
,dakebs,2012-08-02T06:39Z,Nice One :)
,kboombr,2012-08-02T08:32Z,which program did u use to install this? i couldnt find  one!
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-02T10:10Z,"Is it possible that you need a cracked version of Steam running to save the game? It doesn't save at all... It's nice to have the game on PC though!!! =) So thank you for that. I have been checking up on this game a week before August 1st... Seeing how you were the first, I got it to try it. It works, very nice. Easy to change resolution and graphic settings. My Acer Aspire laptop has a single core 1.6 ghz processor with ATI Radeon 3200 graphics card, 3 GB ram and I can run it smooth on 800x600 at Low settings... Which yes sucks, but surprisingly the game looks amazing still! I will report back if I figure out the saving method. "
,hiksez,2012-08-02T10:21Z,"azaq318  this game is multiplayer only, thx for upload anyway. "
,cirios83,2012-08-02T11:05Z,Thank you azaq318 
,dakebs,2012-08-02T12:30Z,"I have an Error ""appId is not Configured"" ah can I ask how can I solve this Error"
,amann95,2012-08-02T21:44Z,Did someone find a way to save progress ??
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-03T07:11Z,"I think that this is JUST multi-player which makes me sad... I would LOVE to play this with friends and my wife, offline... anyway you can crack the offline part to it? Because practice does not save at all... And it's the only way for some to play at all. It should save your progress, but this cracked version of it doesn't. I'd love to play it more, but just can't. "
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-03T08:12Z,"Okay, so I figured something out. It is not registering the ID for the game, so I found the ID.
steam://rungameid/211880
I just do not know how to add it to a file so that Awesomenauts can register and then it SHOULD let us save the game. To find the ID on a game from Steam, you normally go click on a shortcut for a game you download/bought from Steam, click on Properties and it shows ^ and it's basically a URL. Maybe someone else can figure out the process with this info, because I sure can't."
,amann95,2012-08-03T19:06Z,"@Magic_friendly tnx for info but like u cant do much with that stuff... just if u find a solution if u have time post it here, i will do the same :)"
,DrunkPollock,2012-08-03T21:38Z,tinyiso release works
,DrunkPollock,2012-08-03T21:40Z,"nvm, its the same. guess you gotta buy."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-04T09:03Z,"I haven't messed with it much so eh, but got a question azaq318... Seeing how you were able to crack this first, and it works (In a sense), any way you could crack Dead Pixels?I know it's cheap but... I would rather play it first before buying it. Besides, nothing like free games."
,amann95,2012-08-04T13:38Z,to ALL THE PPL HERE u dont need to buy it just download skidrows version and download steam(and make acc) and green_luma and ull have access to all games on steam for free. 
,si3wca,2012-08-04T20:46Z,"1. Download and install Steam
2. Download and install GreenLuma  
3. Download and copy crack from skidrow web.
4. Play!"
,Dz_95,2012-08-05T03:22Z,any idea how to hack money??
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-05T10:51Z,"si3wca, thank you! That totally worked. Wow... Never thought of going to their website, duh! Lol...
It works!

1. Download Steam
2. Backup the folder
3. Crack it with Greenluma
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6854781/GreenLuma-2.2.9-Steam (This one works, no virus)
4. Crack Awesomenauts with Skidrow's crack from their website
5. Play it and have fun!"
,B-Blue,2012-08-05T17:32Z,It's MOBA. 3 vs 3 teams. Whichever team destroys the other team's base wins.
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-06T02:28Z,"So why is it now that when I put Skidrow's crack on this game, it saves my level, but will not let me use but my two special abilities. I am level 2 now, so I can customize my loadout, yet I cannot choose the extra abilities to go with my character I choose... Why?"
,bigs7,2012-08-06T02:31Z,What does 3DM means?

,josh1238,2012-08-13T02:58Z,I have some games I bought on steam and I am afraid cracking it will interfere.  Can I have a cracked and uncracked version of steam on the same computer?  I could install them on seperate hardrives if it would be helpfull
,SoulForEver,2012-08-16T03:31Z,"your game do not save practice , really sadness"
