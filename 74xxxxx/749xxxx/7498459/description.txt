From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, August 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Chuck Untersee, director of Behold A Pale Horse: America's Last Chance, starring country music legend Charlie Daniels. The film features such noted patriots as Lieutenant General William Boykin, Elena Chita, Kay Beach, Dr. Katherine Albrecht, Jim Marrs, Dr. Stan Montief, Joel Skousen and Gerald Celente.

Alex also talks with Bernadine Smith, the founder of the Second Amendment Committee, a nationwide organization working to make sure the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights is upheld as the supreme protective law for firearms of law-abiding people. Smith also authored legislation to restore the militia system to its proper role as designed by the framers of the Constitution.
