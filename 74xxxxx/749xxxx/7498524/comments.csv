,undaunt,2012-08-03T08:05Z,"Thanks to NeXTieie for helping it get bootable.

As for those of you interested in doing a USB install for a clean install, and don't want to burn anything, follow below:

Open a command prompt, type ""diskpart"" without quotes, and hit enter.

You'll get into the disk partitioner. It may give you a UAC prompt. Type ""list disk"" to see a list of drives.

Select your flash drive, whichever that number may be, with ""select disk x"" and of course replace the X with the proper number.

Keep in mind this will format your flash drive, so back up whatever is on it if necessary. Type the following commands in order.

clean

create partition primary

select partition 1

format fs=ntfs quick

active

assign

And you're done. The steps format the drive, create a new NTFS partition and set the active flag, then assign it a drive letter.

Finally, extract the Windows installation with WinRAR or something, then just copy the files over.

Make sure you choose the flash drive first in your boot order!"

But not in all cases could the computer be fixed via these tools. Sometimes they had flooded their OS so much (Not knowing of it themselfs) that a simple HDD formatting and reinstallation of Windows was needed to fix the computer. And still after using all these tools the OS is still messed up cus they don't fix everything. The only solution that fixes everything is a HDD formatting and reinstallation of Windows.

Microsoft will always make the next Windows slower, either by adding new features or deliberately bloat up the system. They sell new Windows licenses if people have to buy a new PC. In Windows 8, however, the table market has really taken off and so MS decided to make Windows 8 run on a table SoC. This is great news for us. I find Windows 8 renders its desktop composition almost always at 120fps.

But the metro start menu and its apps are so huge on my 24"" monitor, and they do not allow drag and drop from explorer windows or any good amount of multitasking. I can fit six times more information on the desktop and the apps are allowed to run in the background. I fear people will be held back by the Metro platform and more slowly turn into a more advanced user that can run several programs at a time and know how to maneuver the file system."

All of you who have installed this will need to manually rearm it every 30 days.
Luckily this is very easy.

Follow these steps. 
1. Open a command prompt (Windows Key + X)

2. In the command prompt type; slmgr and hit enter.

3. To display the current license information type into the command prompt;
slmgr /dli and hit enter.

4. To display detailed information on the current license type into the command prompt;
slmgr /dlv and hit enter.

5. To display the expiration date for the current license type into the command prompt;
slmgr /xpr and hit enter.

6. To rearm Windows and extend the grace period, in the command prompt, type;
slmgr /rearm and hit enter.

Looking forward to a crack, but with windows 8 being such a low price it's a steal away.

If anyone stumbles upon any information about cracks etc - i'm sure everyone here would appreciate it if its posted in here. "

you've done work for your local ramada? Well.... You just confirmed the impression we all have that you're a blowhard.


You're wrong, you give bad advice, and I hate dealing with the fallout and lost data when people come to me  for help after getting bad advice from people like you."
