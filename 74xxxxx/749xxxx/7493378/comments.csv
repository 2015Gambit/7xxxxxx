@ peeyoosh1 .... ( Hope you see this comment )

I understand that you need the ""Torrent Text-file"" ITSELF, 
and here's a way to get it if you can't reach it on TPB.

===============================
Go to BitSnoop dott com 
Type in the movies title in the search-box, and 
when you receive ""187 search-results"" .... (or something),
then click on ""sorted by Age"" .... and you'll find pretty easy 
the ""Torrent Text-file"" you're looking for.
Just ""re-name"" the hash-number on the ""Torrent Text-file"" to whatever you prefer.
===============================

I just checked it out on this Upload .... 
It took me ""20 to 40"" seconds to reach the ""Torrent text-file"" (LOL)...."
