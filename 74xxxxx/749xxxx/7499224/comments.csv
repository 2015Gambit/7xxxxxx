,R9k6wh0naIK,2012-08-03T05:20Z,"What is going on here? Every week I am waiting anxiously for the newest Burn Notice to be uploaded.  There are always hundreds if not thousands of seeders listed on the search result page. 

But right now there are about 7 uploads listed and they are all zeros. That's just not right. I'm not a real expert at the technicalities of these torrent things. Anyone have a theory? Am I doing something wrong?"
,myukis,2012-08-03T05:43Z,"My guess is the tracker doesn't update in realtime. I've got all 3 downloading at the moment, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7499373/Burn_Notice_S06E07_HDTV_XviD-3LT0N[ettv] is currently up to 7.1% done."
,taximetrista,2012-08-03T05:46Z,"@R9k6wh0naIK: the seeders/leechers numbers here often take some to refresh, but not necessarily means that doesn't have., though it may be the case."

Geez guy, sometimes the free, you-didn't-pay-for-this, network is a little broken. Inhale and survive."
