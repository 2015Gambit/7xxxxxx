,aquanovix,2012-08-01T13:11Z,"This is real, and it's the best copy I've seen on the internet so far.  Not dvd quality (of course), but very good for a cam.  "
,MJV-2012,2012-08-09T17:46Z,"OK, got this last night. For all questioning its legitimacy yes it is the real deal. All Rars unpack just fine and your left with a large .avi file.
Quality wise, very watchable even for such a long movie by far the best on the net I think.

Visually - Good, there is the odd wobble once or twice during the first 10 min while the camera man adjusts the tripod and a couple of heads pop up but again only in the first 10 minutes. It is however VERY apparent when the video source changes as is mentioned in the NFO as it becomes a lot brighter but this is only for around 5 minutes. For the majority though the video is fine but does look a little washed out but I think this is unavoidable to an extent as like all the batman trilogy the movie is quite dark. 

(7-10) - Nowhere near DVD or R5 but still enjoyable, perhaps similar to the old videotape quality.

Audio - Very good, pretty much spot on throughout. There's perhaps one point where there's a little rustling but that's about it. Also at one point it does become VERY loud momentary when the different video source is used but it balances out almost immediately. 

(8-10) - Apart from the two blips mentioned above, pretty close to DVD in my opinion, as expected for a decent TS. 

Movie - Superb in my opinion, great story, great twist (I shant spoil it for you) even a few moments of humor, brilliant cast, its difficult to go wrong with Morgan Freeman in my opinion :) Its a little on the long side granted but at no point did I start to feel bored or inclined to turn it off despite watching after a long day at work and go to bed. Only point I will mention is it is a MUST that you watch the first film of the trilogy before this (Batman Begins) or large parts will not make sense to you. I also recommend watching the second film (The Dark Knight) first aswell, but this is not as important. Check out the YIFY releases for these if you want quality at a reasonable file size.

Hope this review helped!
