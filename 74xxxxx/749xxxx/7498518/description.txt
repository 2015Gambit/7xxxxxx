A Big thx again to 5-click for the original set :
        
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7497971/May_Model_Set__77_


Original set 151 mb - now only 26 mb (resized by me)

Note that clever use of "resample function" (a much slower resizing method) when resizing sets leads to very small files when the background is a simple one color (like all Virginia sets lately) sets will then be between 12-17 mb's without any visible quality loss. But when the background is more complex (like here outdoors) resized sets with resample function will lead to larger files like between 25-40 mb's.
