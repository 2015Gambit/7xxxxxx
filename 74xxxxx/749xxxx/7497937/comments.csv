On 28 June 2010 the DRM was cracked by replacing the code with offline equivalents. The requirement of a permanent internet connection while playing was relaxed for a while, but was effectively re-instated July 3rd, 2012 because Ubisoft's new Uplay launcher is currently unable to launch the offline version of the game.
