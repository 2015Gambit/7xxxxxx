,CoreyJensen83,2012-08-06T22:18Z,Are there any copies of this series that aren't .mkv? I use vuze and .mkv takes forever to transcode to my ps3. Any conversion programs that are quick?

You can turn MKV into MP4 in just a couple minutes using Avidemux.

Download; install; run Avidemux.
Drop the MKV into Avidemux.
Click Yes on the H.264 Confirmation window.
Leave Video and Audio as ""Copy"".
Change the Format to MP4.
Save - be sure to add .mp4 as file extension.
Click Yes to invalid audio stream; PS3 can play MP4 with AC3 audio no problem.
Wait a minute.
Stream the MP4 to the PS3 and enjoy the show!"
