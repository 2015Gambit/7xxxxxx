,starlight715,2012-08-01T20:34Z,Why can't I watch it? It's in tons of small files. 
,prokofjew,2012-08-02T02:05Z,"wonderful. thank you so much!
people, first open the .rar file using rar expander (if you have mac), expand it, and everything will have sense, all the clips will be in one single video. "
,guitarjustin,2012-08-02T15:37Z,I've dl'ed this file twice. Unable to expand due to either corruption or password.
,TheBanner,2012-08-02T17:33Z,"@guitarjustin, if you view one of the RAR files, you will see an MKV file ... extract one of the RAR files using WINRAR and you will have the file ..."
,bigplumpy,2012-08-02T23:09Z,"I never have problems opening rar files , yet this one wont open.
screw nbc for putting us through this just to see our girls kick ass"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-03T13:08Z,Thank you. Great quality. Extracts without any problem.
,highlander888,2012-08-04T11:42Z,Thanks for the huge upload! Was able to unRAR the files with no problems and no passwords.
,Atseng,2012-08-05T09:54Z,can you please also upload table tennis? 
,i6X9i,2012-09-14T20:57Z,"Love your work sceneline!!!  Awesome quality.  Great Stuff.

Any chance you have or can do the 2008 Beijing Olympics Women's Gymnastics All-Around, Team Finals, Apparatus Finals, and Qualifications???  The Men's too.  And preferably non-NBC.  NBC broadcast sucks.

Keep up the awesome work.  You the man...or woman!"
