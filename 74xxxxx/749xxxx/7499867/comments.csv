,Potato23,2012-08-04T08:03Z,Do you know how many episodes will be in this season? And it sucks that the guy on treasure trader passed away cause i was really getting into that show.
[V],psspss,2012-08-04T08:18Z,"yeh treasure trader was better then many of these reality dealer shows.. but alas

live always on the go ..as they say.. burn the candle at both ends it last half as long

nope i dont know how many.. sicne laster year was only 4 weeks.. and this one is 8 now
i kinda suspect maybe is the last one or a couple more to go.. 10 or 12

also deals from the dark side was a little like
trader series also good and canadian also
but we missing 4 episodes of that still
and the final was a extra long special too

I dont like oddities so much.. though

storage wars and hunters I like better"
