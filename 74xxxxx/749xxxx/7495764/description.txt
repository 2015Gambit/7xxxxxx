ALMS American Le Mans Series race #4 - Lime Rock Connecticut - 7-July-2012

This is the 4th race of the ALMS racing season, held at Lime Rock Park, in 
Lakeville, Connecticut. The NORTHEAST GRAND PRIX is a 2 hour 45 minute timed event 
run over a 1.5 mile road course of 8 turns. Sixteen ALMS Prototype entries and 19 
GT class contenders are scheduled to compete in 4 seperate classes. This race was 
streamed live from beginning to end over the net. Then later the same day a 
shortened and condensed two hour version was broadcast in 720p  HiDef on TV. This 
download is an edited version of that broadcast.

This download is a .ISO file intended to be written directly to a blank 4.4GB DVD.
Then you can play it on your living room Blu-Ray console connected to your big 
screen HDTV. You can also play it on your computer DVD drive with appropriate 
software. The video is encoded in a hybrid format called BD5 that is compatible 
with all Blu-Ray console players but not likely any DVD consoles.

If you wish to play the download on your computer you can use a virtual DVD emulator 
utility, like the free DAEMONTools Lite, to "mount" the .ISO file as a temporary 
DVD drive. Then you can play the video directly using any Blu-Ray compatible media 
player. I often use the freely available DAPlayer. If you have the correct AVCHD 
CODECs installed then even Windows Media Player can be used.
