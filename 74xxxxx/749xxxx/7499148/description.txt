Serial Box is a database containing serial numbers for software as well as hack/crack information. The serials themselves are often 'shared' by a single purchaser who has submitted their serial to Serial Box's authors (although the legality of this in relation to a software vendors SLA is questionable).

That being said, it's best to use programs that are authorized with serial box serial numbers offline only.
