Defends your PC from Internet
attacks
Firewall Protection
Prevents malware from being
installed on your PC

Comodo Firewall offers the highest levels of security against inbound and outbound threats. It stealths your computer's ports against hackers and blocks malicious software from transmitting your confidential data over the Internet. Comodo Firewall makes it easy for you to specify exactly which applications are allowed to connect to the Internet and immediately warns you when there is suspicious activity.

Comodo Firewall will monitor all aspects of communications between your computer and the Internet. This prevents common hacking methods such as port scanning. The firewall references a list of over two million known PC-friendly applications. If a file is not on this 'safe-list', the Firewall immediately alerts you to the possibility of attacking malware.

A Firewall will block threats that antivirus alone misses; prevent hackers attempting to break into your computer and provide outbound firewall protection to stop spyware from phoning home.

Comodo Firewall uses a default-deny protection paradigm to make sure only known PC-safe applications are allowed to run. Auto Sandbox TechnologyΓäó, a virtual operating environment for untrusted programs, means the default deny protection paradigm can be executed without disrupting the workflow of the user. Cloud based Behavior Analysis bolsters this protection by helping to identify zero-day malware.
