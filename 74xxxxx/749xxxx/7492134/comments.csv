PS. Hypocritic networks et al.. they show people die online on TV yet Walter says once, just ONCE ""Fuck you"" to Gretchel in an adult series and they freeking cut it out even on BluRay.. Hilarious and sad.."

,j5ize,2012-09-02T06:07Z,"A:9 V:8

Every episode has English subtitles. The files are .mkv

All things considered, I give this a 6.5/10. Good upload, but not the best. Regardless, thanks mike953100. I'll seed this to 3:1 at least"
,pr0sieeb0,2012-09-10T23:19Z,got stuck at 99% for a while but great upload
