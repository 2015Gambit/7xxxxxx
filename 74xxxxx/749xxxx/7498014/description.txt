As usual Immerse's has sketchy IVTC anytime there's any motion.
This is getting really old now guys. Fix your shit, if the rest
of the US and international TV scenes can ivtc properly, you should
too. We know you can't do anything about when theres a graphic overlay
but the rest of the time isn't rocket science.


Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?
