DOWNLOAD & SEED! WE HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS HERE.


Overgrowth picks up where Lugaru left off, with the world in a state of de facto anarchy. After killing the corrupted king, Turner, the main character, refused to take his place, instead choosing to leave the monarchy headless and wander the island in search of some new purpose.
Overgrowth's setting appears to build on that premise, as concept art shows a chaotic world with tall structures overrun by vegetation, and inhabited by fierce rabbits, wolves, rats, cats and dogs, trying to survive with simple weapons and makeshift armor. Some concept art shows a city with an organic layout.
An interview with Wolfire Games by British video gaming website zConnection revealed some more details regarding the game's storyline and plot.

(I am sorry I could not find a proper description. Sorry! :P)

The game automatically runs in windowed mode. If you have some errors just press okay. It's supposed to be like that :D.

Have fun! Leech and seed.
