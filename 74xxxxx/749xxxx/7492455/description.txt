                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Follow-up to the January documentary exploring the increase in stealing from 
 Britain's stores, and the sophisticated tactics used by both the thieves and 
 those out to catch them. Cameras are in York, where the second recession in 
 four years is causing the profile of shoplifters to change, with a 
 wheelchair-user and a pensioner among the bewildering array of characters 
 caught red-handed. One shop is losing 1,000 worth of goods per week to 
 shoplifters - so the bosses call in Steve and Dan, the self-proclaimed `Batman 
 and Robin of Brighton' seen in the first film, to help solve the problem. 


                                 Enjoy!
