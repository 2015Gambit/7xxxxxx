Deadlight XBLA XBOX360-XBLAplus

The world has ended. There is no hope. No new beginning. Only the survivors. 
DEADLIGHT follows the journey of Randall Wayne, a man searching for his family 
across Seattle during the  aftermath of a 1980s event that has decimated life 
on earth. This visually stunning Cinematic Survival Platformer will challenge 
you to run, jump, climb, and struggle for your life as you look for answers and 
the ones you love.

Deadlight is a narrative driven puzzle platformer set in the postapocalyptic 80s 
devastated by a zombie epidemic.

A unique graphical approach with 3D backlit silhouettes increasing immersion with 
a continuous notion of danger.

Survive above all and face your fears.

Solve obstacles, dodge zombies, set traps and manipulate the environment. Escape 
any way you can!

Combat is always an option, albeit a poor one
