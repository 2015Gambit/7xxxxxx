one of your super duper great uploads 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7276152/Studio_Ghibli_Movie_Pack_HD_%5B1280x720_Dual-Audio

is this but although it has many seeds it is way too much slow i have been downloading for 30+ hours still did not have 10% uploade almost equal to that ammount. First it was fast but now it is slow can you do something about it please[ like reseed with a high speed]

however your work is very much appreciated.  "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-02T14:41Z,is slow because Demonoid is down and that is where most of the fast seeds are from
