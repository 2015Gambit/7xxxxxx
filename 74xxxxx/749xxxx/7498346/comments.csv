Movie definitely let me down. Story could have been better and not near enough action scenes with guns. Liam barely even had a role.

It has some cornball parts and too much political correctness which is a turnoff for me but the movie as a whole was quite well done and is major entertainment. The special effects are impressive. "

That was a stupid, completely unbelievable movie, not even possible in a sci-fi kind of way.  But at least I made it to the end (almost).  If you want to completely waste a part of your life, it's an OK way to do it."
