Bambas Dois is the new recording by Brazilian producer Bid. The idea behind the project is to blend North Eastern Brazilian music with Jamaican. As you can hear from the trailer it’s quite a smooth blend with those Trad Brazilian rhythms such as Forró and Maracatu mixing almost seamlessly with the Jamaican skank. I rate Bid as producer, in 2005 he released “Bambas & Biritas” which was superb example of modern MPB and stayed on the household stereo for months, a rare thing nowadays.
