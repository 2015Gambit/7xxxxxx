There's a chance you'll upload ""Mean Girls"" someday? Would love to see that movie in 720p w/ Portuguese subtitles, I can't find it anywhere. Thank you!"
,MacGenius,2012-08-03T06:44Z,"Thanks!

relaying our convo frm sn dot im/tmrconvo

@ tr108, Awesome!
But I was not able to get these files detected on a 4th gen Samsung LCD tv with a usb port, It does detect & play mkv, mp4, flv, avi files, I have not tried other m4vs, but I thought I'd ask you if they are not meant to because these are coded for the latest iDevices?"

Please help."
,DK41,2012-08-10T01:04Z,"You sir, are the best uploader I've found for movies! I love it, because they're in amazing quality and already in mobile format so no need for a video converter that may tend to reduce video or audio quality! Thank you for the uploads and please continue!"

You're the best uploader for mobile format!"
,jtbath0m3,2012-08-22T12:52Z,Can you upload the new series of Doctor Who when it starts?
[T],tr108,2012-08-30T21:37Z,"Guys, I'm sorry, but they'll be no more ups. Machine is down.

And, to be quite honest, since I'm not feeling how folks are talking about me (https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7561050/) while I'm out of commission, I'll never be back here. (too much drama in my offline life to read reckless bs about me online).

I never expected anything out of this -- I did it because it was fun, I love movies, had a spare machine, and know a little bit more about compression than the average man -- but now that the fun is gone, and the machine is dead, the ride's is over.

Since most of you have been kind enough to support with positive comments (and seed, hopefully), I figured I at least owed you a sign-off message."
,FabioXS,2012-08-31T00:07Z,"Oh man.. that sucks, some people are really ungreatfull. You were doin' a fenomenal job!

Thank you for all the effort you put in for us..

Are you still release the guide?"
,thefan23,2012-08-31T05:58Z,"Thats not right of them.. you really have been a great help to most of us. sorry you want to leave. 

Thanks for your time."
,Sifu73,2012-08-31T20:50Z,"You should ignore the disses out there and not them bother you!  I really enjoy watching all of your posts for the quality and size of the rips!  You have to take the negative comments with a grain of salt!  Uploaders like axxo, secretmyth, lifechanger, etc. got them all the time!  You can't please everyone!  I hope you reconsider and continue posting for the masses in the BT community that love your stuff!!!"
,hdreyes,2012-09-01T02:46Z,"Wow, really sad to hear you won't be uploading! Too bad your machine is dead. 

But I'd like to thank you for the great uploads! You've got great work and I have enjoyed it very much. I will most certainly miss your work. I remember when I found your Uploads, I was quite happy!

I am surprised though, didn't think you'd take the negative comments to heart. You should know better.

One thing I don't understand is why the uploaders don't have some kind of donating account. I would love to give back you guys. It's the least we could 

Well, Thank you very much! I will always check to see if you're back, one can only hope."
,Katneni143,2012-09-03T20:59Z,"Hi TR108..

There are A Holes all around us. we should never hear, listen or care of them. No matter what you do there will be some who will stand with you and some against you. 

We love your work and we will definitely miss you.. Hoping you will come back âŚ."
[T],dabadguy69,2012-09-06T06:44Z,much respect to you tr108  
,12uel,2012-09-08T09:44Z,"'will surely miss your high quality uploads. I always check you first before anybody else to see if you have any new uploads. First HolyRoses, then you...how come the good ones disappear?!!! Much respect to your decision."
,carlamatic,2012-09-09T23:26Z,"I'm really sad to see you stop doing your uploads, tr108. I've enjoyed them and was looking forward to your encodes of Prometheus and The Avengers.

Many thanks to you for all you've shared and best wishes for the future."
,baybeh,2012-09-16T19:01Z,"come back tr108, you're too good for those bitchin' morons."
,Katneni143,2012-09-17T20:31Z,can any one tell me who is the next best to download M4V movies ???
