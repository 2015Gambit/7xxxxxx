A nice introduction to indie for 60ties and 70ties music lovers. To keep up and renew our love for real music. Now all we need is a PC and a microphone. Attention is again focused on the music. Sounds new and familiar. The first downloads can be slow, so please help seeding.... and enjoy (Specs result in DB Errors)
