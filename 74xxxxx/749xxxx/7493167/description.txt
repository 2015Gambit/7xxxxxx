The ClinicianΓÇÖs Pocket Reference is based on a University of Kentucky house manual entitledSo You Want to Be a Scut Monkey: Medical StudentΓÇÖs and House OfficerΓÇÖs Clinical Handbook. 

The Scut Monkey Program at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine
began in the summer of 1978 and was developed by members of the Class of 1980 to help
ease the often frustrating transition from the preclinical to the clinical years of medical school. From detailed surveys at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine and 44 other medical schools, a list of essential information and skills that third-year students should be familiar with at the start of their clinical years was developed. The Scut Monkey Program was developed around this core of material and consisted of reference manuals and a series of workshops conducted at the start of the third year. Presented originally as a pilot program for the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Class of 1981, the program has been incorporated into the third-year curriculum. It is the responsibility of each new fourthyear class to orient the new third-year students. The basis of the programΓÇÖs success is the fact that it was developed and taught by students for other students. This method has allowed us to maintain perspective on those areas that are critical not only for learning while on the wards but also for delivering effective patient care.
