So with our dear departed demonoid MIA, I've decided to upload some of the collections I downloaded from there to pirate bay. All credit goes to the original scanners and posters, I'm just trying to make it available.

This one is the soon to be trilogy by patrick rothfuss called the kingkiller chronicles. they are optimized for kindle, but if you have calibre I'm sure you can get it to work for anything.
