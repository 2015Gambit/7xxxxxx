Same. Works perfectly. Just make sure you have the latest version 1.7 and 7zip and it will work just fine. Works with steam and without steam.

So dont bitch about it not working till you have 1.7 update to play it and 7zip to extract it. WINRAR DONT WORK TO EXTRACT XD.

It works fine with 1.7. I have encountered no problems at all on my 5 year old Dell.

,ralof8,2012-08-03T23:00Z,"and don't forget to set your load order
.esp must under .esm
ex :
skyrim.esm
update.esm
dawnguard.esm
dawnguard.esp
etc

if your esm is under esp then move it manually or your game will crash"
,RammNB,2012-08-04T01:11Z,"I own a legal copy of Skyrim in Steam, but Dawnguard won't run... I don't have any crash issues, its just that Dawnguard doesn't appear in-game."

bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=3
bEnableFileSelection=1
save and start the launcher, and you should get the data option to work!!"

So? did it work?"
,grande07,2012-08-04T03:55Z,"for those who can't see the dawnguard esm file in the data files list, read the following.

If you have these kind of problems:

1. Skyrim Data Files button on Skyrim Launcher not greyed out.
2. No esps or esms shown on the list.
3. But there ARE esps and esms on your skyrim data folder.

Then the solution is on your registry. Skyrim Registry String Value.
change the string value into your skyrim installation directory.

SO get to it then. How?

Open up your Windows® Regedit.

Find this folder : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Bethesda Softworks/Skyrim

Extra step: If that doesn't exist create it. Also create a new string value and rename it into ""Installed Path"".

Make sure you set the string value by your skyrim installation directory.    
example: E:Program FilesBethesda SoftworksSkyrim

anyone have the same issue?"

Were you getting an animation error as the Vampire Lord too?? I transform and get no animations but no one is hostile towards me."

animation, questline it's worked well"

My crossbow's secondary attack is working perfectly, but the primary action just displays a punch animation.

I'm on patch 1.6.89.06."
,IzayaOrihara,2012-08-06T00:02Z,"Confirmed working on steam version of skyrim. It's just a BSA and an ESM file.

Torrented Fallout 3 and New Vegas DLC's also work with the steam version of skyrim.

I did have a problem extracting this however. Only 7-zip would extract it, and it took 30 minutes to extract it. Winzip/Winrar just returned  method errors and said no files were found to be extracted."
,cp60,2012-08-06T17:48Z,"There are obviously many people with the problem of no animation in vampire mode. I am one of them and it's pissing me off. There are no solutions nowhere. Can someone PLEASE figure something out? I have installed, re-installed and done soo many different things that I think skyrim can be called a whore now.. it's unplayable with the problem - you cannot attack in vampire mode, just transform back into human."
,zimos88,2012-08-06T21:52Z,"fixed my issue with the vampires going hostile, i just sneaked out the castle and waited 24 hours, then i returned and they were my best friends ¬¬

people with animations issue: u guys are playing custom races?"
,zimos88,2012-08-06T21:53Z,DNA update to 1.7.7
,cp60,2012-08-07T05:59Z,"No, I have no mods at all, I downloaded original skyrim and dawnguard and just installed those. Iz sad for not being able to vampire =(

And I also had once the vampires at the castle attack me... it waas just when all the people were attacking me for being a vampire.. I went to the castle to feed on cattle, but as you can see, that didn't turn out well. So I loaded my game and found someone else to feed on and when I went to the castle then, they had no problem with me. Can't be sure that my vampirism was the problem though, it just fits..."
,stealthpancho,2012-08-07T08:07Z,I knew it! Im almost done dl the steam version. Ill report back to let u guys know if it worked!
,aJaKz,2012-08-07T08:49Z,"@zimos
no, checking it now with an Imperial, and crossbow animation is still jacked even with 1.7.7 (My current version) just goes to unarmed stance, not sure about vampire lord yet, will post back with results. P.S. It may be a double post."
,blablaman1989,2012-08-07T09:31Z,For the people that can't get the data thing button to work just delete the files (EXCEPT THE GAME SAVES) in documentsmy gamesSkyrim. There should be 3 files in total to delete and after that just load the launcher and you should be ready to play dawnguard. It seems to work but i just got it to work now.
,blablaman1989,2012-08-07T09:37Z,sorry here it is again /documents/my games/skyrim/
,cp60,2012-08-07T14:47Z,Solved The animation issue by doing another reinstall and downloading new torrents.

would you mind posting the files you downloaded? Turns out 1.7 (update 10) causes some major bugs with dawnguard, running update 9-reloaded for mine, SKSE as well. but still having the animation bug."

,aJaKz,2012-08-09T09:30Z,"@cp60
If i can get all this installed tonight, Ill post in the morning, unless someone gets to it first. However i have to ask, you know when something has an ID that the 1st two numbers are the load order?
IE:
I have an item in one mod, ID as follows: ""0F003D8B"" Its a sword mod if i remember right, but the 0F are teh load order"
,azisco,2012-08-09T19:32Z,"For those that are having issues extracting even with 7zip, try downloading the newest version. It seems to be extracting fine, although it's going to take awhile."
,azisco,2012-08-09T21:27Z,"Seems to be working fine on my steam version. I got bored pretty quickly thought because my character is OP at this point, and I don't want to lose all of my progress by starting a new character (especially since I've already played as every archetype) so this isn't for me. If this had come out when most of us were playing the game I would have been all over it, but as it is this is too little too late if you ask me."
,ccrusher1,2012-08-13T06:11Z,"To anyone who's having a problem with animations:
PLEASE make sure you have the latest patch. Since a few days before this DLC came out, there was an update released. For those that aren't using steam, you need to find a cracked update. Hope this helped."
