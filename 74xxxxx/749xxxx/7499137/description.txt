This may or may not work!

Inside the zip are Dawnguard.bsa and Dawnguard.esm, fresh from Steam.

Download this and extract it to your SkyrimData directory, and make sure to activate the Dawnguard .esm in your launcher of choice.

I'm not sure if this will work without Patch 1.7/Update 10; wait for people smarter than me to release it.

If this works, good job!
