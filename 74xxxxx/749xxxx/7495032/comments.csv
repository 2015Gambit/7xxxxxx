,louballs022,2012-09-03T05:54Z,CINAVIA!! Why don't more people mention this??  Huge inconvenience.
,husdude,2012-09-06T08:58Z,"For Cinavia there's an easy way to solve it -

After the sound gets muted , exit the movie and go to date time settings . 
Then change the time 1 hour up or down 
Go back play the movie 
Exit once again 
And again change the time back to where it was 
And Voila , play the movie .. but it will play for another 20 min 
Repeat the same .. "

It's an adrenaline rush from start to finish, and the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. Even the dubbed dialogue is pretty good - not always perfect, but definitely better than a lot of the dubbed foreign movies on the market today.
