In this Episode #1-5 we will have a look at:
- Episode 1 Back to School -
Windows XP and general PC maintenance
Epson MFP
Microsoft Encarta 2005
The hilight of this episode,  showing how to clean CRT monitors, and looking at Microsoft Encarta 2005, I think it came on 8 or 9 CDs!

To launch our 3rd season at CITY TV I concentrated on the education market.
We start out with a bit on maintenance, using system updates. This show has a Windows focus, and I am showing all this in Wiondows XP. We look at updates, system packs and updating applications.
Then I rolled up my sleeves and talked about physical cleaning and maintenance, I actually show cleaning CRT monitors, I had forgotten about those! This segment is actually still really relevant!
For students I take a look at the old Epson CX line of MFPs. remember back in those days people often had separate scanners, and printers, remember that?
Microsoft made a huge investment back in the day in Encarta, This was before the Web became the resource it is today.
I smiled as I watched this demo, as so much of what we were showing on Encarta is a harbinger of the type of content we value online

- Episode 2 Small Business Publishing -
In this episode I take a pass at small business solutions.Starting with a demo of Microsoft Office 2003, yep thatΓÇÖs right, 2003! Do you remember living in Office? The scary thing is for many people, this is still current. It is interesting that the techniques I show in this episode are still relevant today!
I move on to a  small publishing project creating a brochure using Microsoft Publisher. You know, even in 2005 I was not really all that down with Publisher, but I think we made it look pretty good, and other options were near as cumbersome. We print the project  looking at the HP9130 Multifunction Printer. A great old Inkjet workhorse.
The last part of the show is the best, I spend some time showing how to use that new fangled resource.....Google.....yep, Google. It wasnΓÇÖt the omnipresent force that it is today. I even throw a bone to AltaVista!
