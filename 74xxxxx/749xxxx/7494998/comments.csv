,LordOfAllKittens,2012-08-17T19:01Z,"Dude, you are a legend for uploading all these albums! Seriously, I'm forever indebted to you! :D
(P.S Do you think you will you ever be uploading all these albums in the FLAC format, or just in mp3? Not a request, just curious.)"

Soz man, but I def won't be doing that; I more-or-less upload these for the broke folk who can't afford the albums, so I want to leave some reason for them to buy them later. :P Same reason I strip the album arts. Anything else would feel like I was betraying the music team XD"
