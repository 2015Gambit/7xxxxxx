,ronniemcd,2012-08-03T10:08Z,"@xR1der: According to http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/5319/The-Hunger-Games-2012.html, Hunger games dvd is 18/8. Only 2 weeks to wait. :D"
,ronniemcd,2012-08-03T10:09Z,"Also, for those bitching about 2 files, just use VirtualDub to join them in to one file. Easy as and solves your pissy little problem.

Hackulus, once again you the man!"
,xR1der,2012-08-03T16:06Z,"@ronniemcd

,Contirio,2012-08-04T05:44Z,"It really seems to be cropped, the same is happening with Extremzone copy. Either that or the cameraman was trying to innovate ;) Can anyone confirm? But the copy is excellent."
,taimurkhan,2012-08-07T13:31Z,"thank you so much. btw can someone tell me what the difference between green and pink skulls of the uploaders?, just curious"
,allaboutme34,2012-08-31T06:52Z,"@ taimurkhan Green Skull - VIP,  Pink skull - Trusted,   Blue Skull - moderator... If you see a skull, you can pretty much download without worry, they are very reputable.... They have earned those skulls."
