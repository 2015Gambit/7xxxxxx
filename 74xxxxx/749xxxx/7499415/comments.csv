,govermint,2012-08-03T16:13Z,".avi rules
bring back the .avi before x264
everyday at midnight there are 4 x264s uploaded for every show two-eight hours later there is a .avi.

Idk about the people doing this but my computer can make a x264 into an .avi in 10 minutes, it can't be to hard to release this before a x264"
