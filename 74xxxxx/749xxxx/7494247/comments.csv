,xxdocxx,2012-08-02T22:31Z,@psspss Having multiple sclerosis has little impact on overall life expectancy in most cases. its all about healthy living. thanks for the upload enjoy your work. keep it up.
[V],psspss,2012-08-03T03:58Z,"not according to the wiki on it..

I guess it depends how early they capture it
and treat it spread"
[V],psspss,2012-08-03T04:00Z,"quote

Life expectancy of people with MS is 5 to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis

I think I uploaded a docu about a woman who reversed hers with diet months ago though
although they claim no affective treatment works"
[V],psspss,2012-08-03T04:11Z,"i see its how its worded I think.. lower then normal life span is what they saying.. 

so whats normal life span.. 80 years? 

either way its a bummer disease.. fooking up the nervous system"
[V],psspss,2012-08-03T04:15Z,"as Bill gates and many others.. said

if they spend all the money on medical research
and scientists thats wasted on wars like middle east in the last 10 years

the money could cure aids within 5 years and
diabetes in 2 years"
,xxdocxx,2012-08-03T14:22Z,"@psspss your right approx 80 is the life expectancy of a male, but this changes from country to country. so lets say he lives to 70 or 75 thats not bad considering. but all speculation of course. cheers"
