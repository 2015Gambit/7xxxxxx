................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, July 31 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex welcomes back to the show director, writer and actor Tyrel Ventura. Tyler and Alex cover a number of topics, including his father's TruTV show, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventrua. 

Alex also talks with author Fritz Springmeier in-studio. Fritz's latest book is Bloodlines of the Illuminati, a literal encyclopedia of rare, unbelievable information that exposes the dynasties that make up the global elite.

Alex also delves into the latest news and continues his expos√© of the globalist push for total gun control and a decimation of the Second Amendment.

NOTE: A 10+ minute infomercial for Pollen Burst Plus is edited out of the first half of hour 3.
