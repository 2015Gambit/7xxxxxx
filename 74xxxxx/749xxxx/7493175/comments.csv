""Select"" means it only contains the higher quality pictures (those which were voted highest). I also removed the tracker http://www.ponibooru.org/waterfall/announce.php  from the magnet links because it is no longer running. Feel free to add it back yourself.

None of the filenames in this torrent are shortened, so you may run into some issues as described in OP's description."
