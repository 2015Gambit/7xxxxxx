Demonoid, one of the biggest torrent sites on the internet, has been down for a few days as it was hit by a DDoS cyber attack. The site is not expected to run any time soon as the issue will be difficult to fix.
The site has been inaccessible to its millions of users for a few days as it was taken down due to a massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which caused a series of problems.
Those who try to access the site get a message similar to this:
""Server too busy
Like Us on Facebook 
The action you requested could not be completed because the server is too busy.
Please try again in a few minutes.""
However the site does not work after a few minutes. In fact it may take days, weeks, or even months to get the site up and running again as the problem is very difficult to fix.
""It started as a DDoS but then it caused a series of problems. These problems need to be fixed before the site can go back up, and it's a complicated fix this time,"" the Demonoid admin told TorrentFreak.
The DDoS attack may not be the only attack that the site faced. Demonoid's server may have been hit with an additional attack.
""There might have been an attack from another angle, an exploit of sorts, but it's hard to tell right now without a full check of everything,"" the admin says.
Besides being a difficult problem to fix, there is only one person available to fix the server issues as the company's staff took a heavy hit earlier in the year. Due to the lack of staff, the repair process will be a slow one.
""Our human resources became limited in the last few months. All tech issues are handled just by me now and there is no one else to take the job,"" the admin told TorrentFreak. ""I'll fix the site as soon as possible, but it might be a while this time,"" the admin says.
This isn't the first time the site was hit with an attack that brought it down. It was hit several times, resulting in the site being down for months at a time.
The site has also been taken down due to legal issues such as anti-piracy. However there is no indication that the recent attack is due to a legal action.
The millions of users of the site are just going to have to wait until administrators are able to solve the problem and can get the site up and running again."
