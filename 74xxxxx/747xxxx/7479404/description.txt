This iso contains Ar Tonelico Melody Of Elemia & Disgaea Hour Of Darkness on 1 dvd5 disk just burn at 4x with your favorite burning program to a single dvd5 disk. I tested this iso and it works with Esr,Swap Magic 3.6&3.8 and also openps2loader & usbadvance. Oh one more thing i'm pretty sure this works off the hardrive with hdloader but i haven't tested it yet i'll get back to you on that check the comments if it does work i'll post a comment confirming it.
