,phat_71,2012-08-21T04:08Z,"Well it's not ideal since I already own an original copy of Disgaea (from way back before it got re-distributed, and cost like 70$, lol) but no other copies of Ar Tonelico I found seem to want to download, so here we go! Thanks in advance (assuming it works!)"
,shikibane,2012-09-06T18:23Z,@phat_71 It works i'm sure of it i tested the crap out of it before i uploaded it. Oh and sorry its not ideal for you if you have any suggestions as to which games i should upload please let me know. Oh by the way I'm uploading disgaea 2 and ar tonelico 2 pretty soon
