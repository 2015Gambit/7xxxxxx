,kuijiblob,2012-07-26T02:09Z,"The quality of this is identical to the quality of the cam released several days ago. Also the other Telesync by unique is bullshit as well. You may have fooled the scene release sites but not me. The guy who uploaded this just wanted more adfly visits so he reencoded the same version with worse quality.
V = 3
A=7"
,reowner,2012-07-26T02:11Z,"TS Audio quality is way better than the CAM. same video though, i highly recommend the TS"
,Tron1,2012-07-26T03:01Z,"I think we have a winner folks, looks good"
,michaelrwatson,2012-07-26T03:56Z,"Wow, what a lot of stupid comments."
,tinycrab,2012-07-26T05:04Z,"Thank you for the great upload. watched it today and although it wasn't DVD quality, for a cam it was very watchable. The movie was great.
Thanks again for another great upload Froggie100!"
,rezabrando,2012-07-26T11:23Z,TS mean recorded with a high end camera and a separate audio source. The print of this version is still CAM. Audio is good though. It should be CAM + New Auido. NOT TS.
,trenken,2012-07-26T19:56Z,"Just another version of that awful cam thats been floating around. Not worth it. Its very dark, blurry, constantly goes way out of focus, audio is out of sync and generally just complete crap."
,jacky86,2012-07-26T23:13Z,"Best quality so far!

A: 8
V: 6

I'm gonna watch it right now"
,Metacognition,2012-07-27T01:35Z,"Best CAM I've seen yet. Audio is actually decent and the video is no worse than other CAMS (which isn't great, but that's to be expected).
Thanks!"
,IsoSucks,2012-07-27T12:59Z,@jacky86  are you blind ? from the screen shots I can tell you that its a1/v? your a bath salt user ant you come on don't lie to us I bet your hooked on the stuff .........I'm a skip and I know that shit is bad for you go smoke some weed or something  
,skullhill,2012-07-28T05:12Z,"BEST audio so far

,You_Muppet,2012-07-28T14:52Z,"With a nod to @Silencer7, I also downloaded 5 versions of this torrent and here are my scores: 

A-5, V-5, 1.86GB - RESISTANCE uploaded by S4A
A-5, V-5, 2.17GB - FUTiLE uploaded by TvTeam
A-5, V-6, 2.17GB - INSPiRAL uploaded by S4A
A-6, V-6, 1.94GB - UNiQUE uploaded by Mantesh
A-7, V-6, 1.87GB - TS Xvid 26K uploaded by Froggie

For me, the last print ... which is this torrent ... is the most watchable because of the audio. 

Thanks froggie100 and all seeders."
,Smidii,2012-07-29T01:22Z,"A:7
V:4.5"
,rezabrando,2012-07-29T02:50Z,Best version so far.
,onisionX,2012-07-29T11:24Z,Best video quality: 1.1GB - FEEL FREE uploaded by Bone. 
,blueskullking,2012-07-29T18:03Z,"ur all supporting CAM bullshit by being here. Imo, If I wanted to go to a movie, I would, fact I live less than 20 metres from a cinema, And I could take my HD cam and hit record. But, I won't.. cos I won't try sell u shit!  Come on this is Batman for crying out loud, A movie which SOULD be seen in HD!!!!nothing less!"
,mjgjorengbjkore,2012-07-29T21:45Z,this sucks! go get a job! u bum!
,fuckyourbullshit,2012-07-29T23:56Z,"Really quite good, won't get much better from cam. TS audio is very good apart one tiny bit where volume weirds out for a few seconds.

For a cam/TS  V:8 A:8

Totally watchable"
,_thermostat,2012-07-31T00:00Z,"Most of these comments are fucking retarded potato slurs, but reowner takes the whole fucking trophy cabinet straight to fucking hell."
,a40ozToFreedom3,2012-07-31T04:34Z,"Very Watchable! its not dvd, its a cam, take it or leave it. Just watched the whole movie and it got a little dark in a few spots but not bad at all. audio was good, video was good. anyone complaining is just being a jaded cry baby.  if you hate cams then why are you on the page at all? I would recommend seeing it in the theaters first but bottom line, this is a good copy to watch if ya dont wanna wait."
,Silencer7,2012-07-31T21:38Z,"LOL! Hey, You_Muppet!

:o)"
,DRAKECANTON,2012-08-01T22:04Z,"what kind of cam is this? is this edited or something? havnt seen the whole thing yet, but there are parts of the first scene edited out."
,DRAKECANTON,2012-08-01T22:49Z,"whoops, disregard that. sorry"
