Back in 2006 on a stormy December night, Amy Winehouse flew to the remote, south-western 
corner of Ireland to perform for Other Voices, an acclaimed Irish TV music series filmed 
in Dingle every winter. Amy took to the stage of Saint James's church, capacity 85, and 
wowed the small, packed crowd with a searing, acoustic set of songs from Back to Black.

After leaving the stage, a relaxed and happy Amy spoke about her music and influences
Mahalia Jackson, Sarah Vaughan, Ray Charles and the Shangri-Las to name a few. Arena 
joined forces with Other Voices and went to Dingle to catch up with some of the people 
that Amy met on that day, including taxi driver Paddy Kennedy, her bass player Dale Davis 
and Rev Mairt Hanley of the Other Voices church.

This film showcases not only Amy herself, but the musical geniuses that inspired her to 
forge her own jazz pop style.
