         VIDEO - KINGDOM
Notes: Right first off nice work kingdom ...keep them coming
Video was decent but cropped and sometimes have bad angles...also some noise,too
colourful and rgb colors a little of for our liking
So dropped in vdub used HQ smoother ( took 11 hrs ffs ) to remove the noise,used
rgb eq to balance the colours better,also changed the brightness,contrast before
adding some sharpness back
Audio was nice aswell but was oos ...and had some noise and too powerful
So dropped that in AA and change all the EQ bands lowering end channels too
remove the noise,and then finally saved as mp3 and remuxed too our rip Oh also
opted too cut the trailors off the begining and also left the intro how it was
with black borders which correct itself with seconds

Ok this time we've used the video we already encoded and just added the line
audio too it.Had to use cam audio from kingdom for the first min then the rest
is from the seen-cm8 release.Changed the audio correction by -100ms and then
cleaned the audio before remuxing
