Thx for this!
I'm really looking foward for Great Britain VS Emirates
From where i live, i can get access to the entire replay of that match, but commentators are french canadians... i dont like it. 
Plus you have to download silverlight and all... fuck it!
Thx to the tremendous work Release Groups are doing so people can view great olympic events!"
