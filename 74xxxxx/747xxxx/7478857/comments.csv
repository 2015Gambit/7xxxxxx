Some people think saying thanks in baby talk is cute! When you're an adult it sounds silly!

Yeah I know I should keep my thoughts to myself, but I'm sure I'm not the first to be thinking it."

@fall1en
You're not the first one thinking this. It sounds silly. You may have failed
to keep your thoughts for yourself. But in exchange you helped another
fellow human being keeping some faith, that there are people who are
not voluntarily opting out of evolution. Our habits form us and we should
be careful about what we are getting used to. "
