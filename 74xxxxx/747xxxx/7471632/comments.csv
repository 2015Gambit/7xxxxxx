Thanks KrazyKrvs. Wunderbar und shabash! Quick download, too. 
They did one hell of a restoration! At least compared to the version I had. Plus they added an extra 30 minutes of scenes.

Anyone interested in comparing this to the colorized version with ""modern"" soundtrack, just to see if it's as crappy as some say it is, it's here:
