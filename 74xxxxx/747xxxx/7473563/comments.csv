,5-click,2012-07-25T14:50Z,I have stopped my other torrent for seeding this. Please be patient. 
,lehsreh,2012-07-25T15:05Z,"Thanks for the upload. I've already asked this question, but haven't gotten an answer. But does anyone have any idea as to how much each model gets paid for each set, and about how much would you say each set makes per month? I'm wondering because I am thinking of starting my own site. I have a few girls that are willing, I'm just wondering if it will be worth it for me."
,ubisuck,2012-07-25T16:01Z,"@5-click: I concur and will add to your last phrase: ""and it is dumb, from what we see through the blurring, it's not something we've never seen from her"""
,l.ky.69,2012-07-25T16:08Z,"great set thanks for upload ,whats the problem with fame site why the blur cant see anything anyway if it wasnt blured ,just stupid ,like play boy and penthouse in the 80's with the blur.is there anyway to write or email site to request better shots.joined site many times in the past,but cancel if they step it up more people will join.agin thanks for making mon,wends,and fridays good day."
,Jenks8529,2012-07-25T16:38Z,Why bother posing nude at all if they're going to blur it out. Thanks for the up anyway.
,captainkhaos1966,2012-07-25T16:52Z,Thanks 5-click

In part answer to your question i am not able to say what fee's these fame-girls receive. 
But on viewing the images that are produced week after week by both the photographer and the said fame-models i would in all honesty say that whatever they receive from sales are dwindling down to a rock bottom model fee.

Let's all be honest here fellow fans we have  been downloading fame-girl sets now for a considerably long time and none are getting what i and probably most others if they were truthful improving in either there model quality and certainly not in there feminine charms to the viewer.
If you want to make your site, and you have the models, Great go ahead. 
But please for all our sakes photo-shoot your models to make them at least slightly sexually appealing.
*This in by no means hits out at the current uploader or those before him/her. 
You all do a splendid job has do those that resize the sets for more manageable and speedier downloads."

Probably have the two (three) girls an exclusive contract, which is not comparable. They do it for many years, while e.g. met-art  presumably paid for each set.
Payments, I do not know, but Sandra has transformed her mother's house. Presumably this has cost more than $ 100,000. There are some single pictures from her, e.g. in her/moms kitchen, looks expensive.

Start small and increase the salary of the models according to monthly sales. Save some of the money for bad days and legal affairs.

I wish you all the best and success in your projects

On the end a little question from me: Is there a chance for a small preview, maybe on TPB."
,lehsreh,2012-07-25T22:51Z,"Thanks for the input  mac04770 and 5-click. I do not have any photos taken yet 5-click. but I have talked to a few(5) who were very excited about it. They would be 19 and older. I read on a few sites that an amateur model gets paid an average of 50$ per hour, which I could to.

I was thinking of doing it like Fame-Girls, being a set Mon, Wen and Fri. It would be a lot of teasing at first, to get their feet wet and get them comfortable with what their doing. These would be your average day girls, which to me is a turn on knowing you could walk into them on a beach somewhere. 

Although I said it would start out with a lot of teasing, one has expressed that she would love to take some shots with one of the other girls. This I believe could probably go a little farther then a simple tease."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-07-25T23:42Z,"THX 5-click !
I can resize all sets that you upload. I agree, you've got enough work with these big sets. Is it a deal ?"
,5-click,2012-07-25T23:49Z,"$ 50 an hour? Sorry but that sounds crazy for an amateur model with no nudity. I have compared some prices for Europe (Germany). 50 âŹ per day with no profit sharing is the usual price. If you calculate with 5 models * 2 sets ĂĄ 2 hours to start, will cost you at $ 1,000. But you only get some money, if you have a few customers. 
Keep in turn, there are thousands of web pages with models, modeling agencies - with and without nudity, pron, stock photo and so on."
,opus20,2012-07-26T01:15Z,"Thank you sq. The blurring might be un-intentional or just a case of auto-batching photos and not paying attention. There is a lag between the last clear picture and the first blurred photo. Photographer manually focus camera without glasses on and screws the rest after that. Pitty, she is a beautiful girl...."
,opus20,2012-07-26T01:27Z,My bad. Thank you 5-click
,slowquin,2012-07-26T09:32Z,@ lehsreh most models don't have a per set deal it's usually a weekly/monthly/yearly contract. If I was starting a site I'd pay them about 3-5K per month. And get releases so you will own the pictures. Talk to a lawyer to have a valid and binding contract with each model. 
,mac04770,2012-07-26T11:14Z,"No disrespect to slowquin, 
But you have no need to pay out lawyers fee's. 
But you will need Model Release forms, these are a very important factor. 
It will allow you all the necessary legal agreements between the 2 parties involved to enable you to take the photograph and your models claim/s, fee, copyright etc etc.
I would never ever use a photo/glamour model without a release form be it for stills or video.  "
,slowquin,2012-07-26T12:09Z,@mac true but it helps to make sure anything is legally binding
,pacin0,2012-07-26T13:26Z,"blur, can't see anything
Thanks for the up anyway."
,pacin0,2012-07-26T13:35Z,Thanks
,mikolo19,2012-07-29T18:09Z,"i agree, the blurring is unnecessary "
