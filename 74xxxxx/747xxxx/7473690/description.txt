I did not see this rather enjoyable read [from 1997] on TPB so I thought I'd share.

At the climax of the Onslaught saga, EarthΓÇÖs mightiest heroes:  The Fantastic Four; The Avengers; Thor; Iron Man; Captain America, and countless others, gave their lives in order to stop Onslaught and to save the world.  With them gone, it seems that even the Marvel Universe has gone quiet.  All thatΓÇÖs left is to pick up the pieces.

Enjoy, and please seed!
