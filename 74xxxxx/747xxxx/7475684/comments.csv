,5-click,2012-07-26T21:02Z,"I know GIMP since v2.4, so for about 5 years. This also has problems, although in other places. Previously, it was for example not possible to group layers, or use the pipette through multiple layers. There is a new version in May, but I did not have time to concern myself with it. Such a thing takes longer than a week, as help only practicing, practicing, practicing. Tutorials are helpful, but only to start or for a single special effect.
The switch from PaintshopPro to Photoshop took me several months.

Thumbs up, for every solution there is a problem.
