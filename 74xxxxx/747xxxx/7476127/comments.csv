,kikoto123,2012-07-26T11:09Z,"There's no crack, it says it in the desc."
,nuzadin,2012-07-26T11:09Z,"Well it's not a fake but it's just like the other valid unlocked version that are out there.

NOTE: Unlocked version are not playable, wait for an actual release it should be up today  or tomorrow I'm very sure that they are working hard on releasing it for the other pirates to play."

,sunny8872,2012-07-26T13:09Z,"Game developer Radical Entertainment will all but shut down, Activision announced Thursday."
,chrisroberts2,2012-07-26T13:24Z,IGN gave this game 7/10 and Infamous 2 9/10.
,nandan01,2012-07-26T14:22Z,no crack
,dash34,2012-07-26T16:00Z,"webchella aah i know ur clever, he would be finishing the game first, then will be thinking to share crack file,etc u suck!! u cheat niggi bean!!"
,Mercer99,2012-07-26T17:15Z,"Dash, why would he do that? And at the guy who said Infamous 2 got 9/10, Infamous 2's PC version doesn't even exist, and I'm not buying a console and learning to use one of those weird wiggly thumb things to play it. Therefore, on PC, Infamous 2 gets 0/10."
,nandan01,2012-07-26T17:17Z,oh how much time will take to come out the track
,XHaloXX,2012-07-26T19:23Z,"it seems this one is like Arkham City, none of big groups had a scene release, hope its not the case, but the crack usually wont take that much of time, usually it comes at the same day of game release."
,ZokTg,2012-07-26T20:19Z,@googleLT tu gal durnas? :D cia nelietuviu torentai :D
,kikoto123,2012-07-26T20:22Z,"The game been released for 2 days in America and Australia, it's obvious, that SKIDROW has already made the crack, but won't release it, at least, not until the game releases in Europe, which will happen tomorrow at 09:00"
,hayatekun,2012-07-27T00:44Z,kikoto what is ur source? just wondering
,Mercer99,2012-07-27T01:03Z,"Why don't they release it before Europe gets it? Better yet, why don't they hack pre-releases? It's either some kind of weird honor code, or more likely, they don't want their cracks being patched on release day. Can someone clarify this for me?"
,Quink666,2012-07-27T02:49Z,.....

,Jfudge17,2012-07-27T20:03Z,"@viperS6 There is also THETA and Ali213 but they rarely beat the other three to the punch unless it is taking a while so its basicly first come first serve, but there is also theories that they are all connected or work together and take turned etc. but no one really knows except for the people inside the scene and they arent going to be commenting on thebay in these shit throwing contests"
