Open Water
With John Logan in CIA custody, Michael Westen can now continue his hunt to dismantle the organization of people that burned him, taking each operative down one-by-one. We start the next volume with Michael and Max leading a team of elite commandos onto a cargo freighter in the Adriatic Sea. The operatives aboard won't come peacefully, which is fine... because Michael's ready for a fight."

Disarm
Michael arrives in Prague looking for three ""enforcers"" that belong to the organization that burned him. With Max's help, Michael learns that they've hired a team of professional thieves to rob a local weapons facility. If Michael and Max want to find the runaway enforcers, they'll have to get hired in the thieves' place... but they'll have to get the thieves fired first."

Cruise Control
In order to prove themselves to Mirek, a dirty Czech intelligence operative, Michael and Max have to steal a shipment of state-of-the-art weaponry. It'd be a fairly simple job if it weren't for the fact that the guns are on an 18-wheeler semi going 70mph."

Follow The Haystack
Mirek is anxious to get his hands on the weapons he hired Michael and Max to steal, but Michael wants to find out where they're being shipped first. This is Michael's only chance to learn the location of the men he's after, but if he stalls too long, Mirek's willingness to pay for the guns will be replaced by his willingness to kill for them."

Battle Scars
Operatives from the organization that burned Michael have been found hiding out in an abandoned Czech hotel with a stockpile of illegal weapons, so the CIA has sent a team of commandos to infiltrate as soon as possible. There isn't much time to prepare the operation, but it's either move in now or risk letting them get away.

Stow Away
His partners are now in custody, but Adrian Testolin is still on the run. While the CIA plans to interrogate Adrian's compatriots, Michael is sent back to Miami to cool off. But if there's one thing Michael Westen doesn't know how to do, it's stay out of the action.

Up Below
Michael, Fiona, and Sam trace Adrian Testolin to his hideout in Canada, but finding him turns out to have been the easy part. Without any help from the CIA, Michael must infiltrate Adrian's heavily guarded compound. Fortunately, Sam's SEAL training may be able to provide a way in...or under."

Up A Creek
Michael, Sam, and Fiona carry out their underwater infiltration of Adrian Testolin's heavily guarded compound. If everything goes exactly as planned, they should be able to get in undetected, apprehend Adrian, and extract him before any alarms are raised. Unfortunately, when you're a spy, nothing ever goes exactly as planned."

Time to Go
The good news is that Sam and Fiona have found away into Adrian Testolin's secure compound. The bad news is that Adrian's guards have captured them. The only way to get out of this alive is to convince Adrian they've been sent by the organization that burned Michael Westen, but there's a small hitch in their plan. It turns out that Adrian has about as much loyalty to his friends as he does to his enemies."
