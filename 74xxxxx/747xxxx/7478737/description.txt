In "Carne" ( Meat) we find Isabel "Coca" Sarli playing the role of Delicia, a young virginal worker of a meat refrigerating factory. During the film she is raped time after time in the backside of a refrigerator truck by several rude workmates, being rescued a little too late by her boyfriend, the only man capable of seeing her pure soul thru her "delicious meat". A masterpiece of "kitsch".
