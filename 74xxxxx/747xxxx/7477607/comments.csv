,dt7ll5op,2012-07-26T22:02Z,"can somebody tell my why it needs to be ""unlocked""? im still using 1.3.6 as thats the latest version i could find where i can collect ducks myself - i think thats the whole point of the game.

can i somehow ""relock"" this version?"

I will upload the locked version 1.7 later."
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-27T11:00Z,"i diffed the 2 release, there is an sqlite database at assets/Data/water.db where you can set the archievements.
i still dont get the ""why?"" through.."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-27T12:04Z,"@dt7ll5op

Can you try to delete the previous install and then reinstall the locked version?"

and i know this isn't a game but could you upload groove ip or some other app i can use to make free calls over wifi? "
[T],bobiras2009,2012-07-29T00:30Z,"@nazim12366

I will upload the latest version"
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-29T11:26Z,"@bobiras22: i will, after my gf finishes completing her current game, as WMW doesnt support user profiles and my phone is not rooted so i cannot backup the game save - and if her progress loses i would be dead in no time."
,dt7ll5op,2012-07-30T00:42Z,"@bobiras22: release works, save data overwrote/initialized at new install (w/app data kept)"
