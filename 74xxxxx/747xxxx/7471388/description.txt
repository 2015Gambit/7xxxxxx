In my effort to produce quality torrents, I learned a lot from this community over the years and I do have many stories I could tellΓÇª 

My philosophy is simple: ΓÇÿpay it forward.ΓÇÖ Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone. Nevertheless, itΓÇÖs the blood in my heart. I am an uploader and a seeder; I donΓÇÖt regulate the bandwidth in my client because I am working from a T1 connectionΓÇöI seed day and night. 

Every torrent of my mine is created from scratch; I spend my time going over them meticulouslyΓÇªremoving garbage, cleaning up files names, organizing them, and hopefully trying to make them a pleasure to view. 

Each one of my torrents is scanned with highly sought-after Symantec Security software (which is the best on the market) and is 100% clean. If you find something ΓÇ£uncleanΓÇ¥ in any of my torrents, consider that it may be a ΓÇ£false positive.ΓÇ¥  

If you have any suggestions, comments, or ideas, let me know.
