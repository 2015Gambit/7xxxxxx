,iguiguigu,2012-07-26T01:39Z,"registered here just to tell you few thing, dead johnpc666... if you think that any people with a right mind will give you any respect with stuff like this, youre a fucking idiot. and you must be a fucking idiot anyway. to put that 666 on your name. wow. that's so fucking cool. and yes, upload more 720p movies that are little and light... ask your more experienced friends there. maybe theyll tell you. and never ever put em specs here. what specs? oops... i just dont know. ask someone who does. jesus christ kid...

John may not have taste in names, but he has 5 (five) pages of uploads and is a trusted source, and u have, ummmmm, NONE. so piss off. U don't like his posts, don't dl them, don't click on em, don't comment, and i bet u're the putz that clicked the minus, just to be as big a dick as u can."
,Brat001,2012-07-26T03:30Z,"people can be so unappreciative. if there's something wrong with the release then fine it's a minus but did you even watch it? and while we're picking on names what the fuck is ""iguiguigu"" anyways? that's pretty lame. there's only so many combinations anyone can do anymore with so many people online. he probably had to add the numbers after someone already had a name similar to his. you're a petty jackass."
