Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, July 25th edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex welcomes long-time returning guest, economist, and contributing writer Paul Craig Roberts to discuss the assault on gun rights in the aftermath of the Colorado shooting, the West's unsuccessful efforts to muster support for Syrian intervention, and the impact the recent Libor scandal will have on world markets. 

Also former federal prosecutor, writer, and former member of the United States House of Representatives Bob Barr returns to expand on his recent Daily Caller article titled, "Homeland Security Continues to Demonize Conservatives and Libertarians" in which he notes that supporters of he or Ron Paul were targeted by a MIAC report warning readers to be weary of "militias" and those that display Gadsden ("Don't tread on me") bumper stickers. 

Not included in the official description, in the later part of hour 3 Alex talks with Bill Andreoli about a FREE "Discount Pharmacy Benefits Card" that promises to save users "10% to 85%" on prescription drug purchases. Alex has another new marketing site for this -- InfowarsRx.com. This is connected in some way to the Youngevity company, whose products are sold at InfowarsTeam.com [see Andreoli's entry at http://youngevity.com/company/management/]. There's also a program allowing people to get these cards in bulk, give them away to people, and then earn a commission each time one of those cards is used. Sounds like a free lunch to me.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
