Version 0.16.0

===================================================================================
Installation:

* Unzip the contents of this package onto a directory of your choice (ex. C:/Program Files/KSP)
* If you plan to overwrite a previous version of KSP with this one, please delete the contents of the folder before unzipping.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MAC USERS:
* The Update Tool requires version 2.8 of the Mono Framework to run. The Mono 2.10.9 Runtime installer is included in the .zip file. Please install it if you are running a version earlier than 2.8, before running the game or patcher. (If you're unsure about your version of Mono, just run the installer).
You can check for the latest version of the Mono Framework Runtime here: http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html

WARNING: It's very likely that parts and/or ships created on previous versions will be incompatible with the latest release. At this point in development it is quite impossible to ensure backward-compatibility at each step, so please keep this in mind. If you encounter something that could be a bug, try again on a fresh installation and no addon parts. It may just be an incompatibility issue.
