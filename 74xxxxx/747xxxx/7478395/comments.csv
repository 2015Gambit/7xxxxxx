,MJimM,2012-07-27T20:49Z,I had a problem with this download but not sure why? No virus shows nor malware but when you click on the folder it causes Windows Explorer to crash...constantly. Has anyone else experienced an issue? Not casting aspersions as it could just be my system but it's a first for me after hundreds of downloads.
