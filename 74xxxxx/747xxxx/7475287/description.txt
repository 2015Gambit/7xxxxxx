This is my first shot at uploading a torrent. I have ripped the video from the DVD and put them in the DivX (*.avi) format with MP3 sound.

This is from the Quatermass series that aired on British TV in 1979, though the copyright is 1978. All four episodes are in this torrent. The movie they did does not make sense. 

Sir John Mills is very good as a retired Bernard Quatermass and Simon MacCorkindale plays Dr. Joe Kapp, a Jewish astronomer.
