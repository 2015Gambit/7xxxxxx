2ch stereo just doesn't cut it when the audio is actually 6ch Dolby Digital.
If it's a downmixing situation when he's outputting the file please correct that.
The audio is just as important as the hd video.

do appreciate the effort."

,cvonc,2012-07-25T07:22Z,"just to clarify everything

both qualifying AND the race are in fact from skysportsHD and the both have 6 channel sky commentary english audio (select audio stream 3 in media player classic), 2 channel sky commentary english audio (stream 2) and 2 channel russian audio (stream 1)

they both do not have intros nor post stuff

but the quality is AWESOME"
