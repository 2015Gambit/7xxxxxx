I will love this no matter what the quality, for me it's all about story!"
,robot-TPB,2012-07-27T04:33Z,"sad to say, the video won't play all the way through. It gives error messages when one starts it up, it will start, but will play most o the way through then stop. Really appreciate the effort, though!"
[V],pirpawn,2012-07-27T12:27Z,"To robot-TPB.

So sorry ! Apparently, the movie seemed to be playing OK with BSPlayer, which I use generally preferably to VLC.

I'm looking into the problem and be back to you soon."
,robot-TPB,2012-07-27T17:40Z,for me it plays ok till 1:11 then no more. Let me know if you can play it to the credits. thx again
,slow-trot,2012-07-30T21:48Z,"There seems to be approximately 20min missing at the end.  The movie stops at 1hr 11min 35sec, same result using VLC/GOM/MPC players."
,robot-TPB,2012-08-01T03:40Z,"While you're absorbing this information, pirpawn, how about another request that I would be astonished if you found:
Slaughter on Tenth Avenue (1957)"
