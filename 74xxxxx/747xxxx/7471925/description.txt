Manufacturing, Engineering and Technology SI 6th Edition - Serope Kalpakjian, Stephen Schmid (2009)

This is a black-and-white scanned textbook, quality of the pictures is poor, but the texts are acceptable. I've been looking for this book since a few months, yesterday I finally found it. Hope you'll like it. And please let me know if you have this ebook in true PDF format, or at least in a colored scan.
