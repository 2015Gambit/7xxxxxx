,ILLMEAT,2012-08-30T15:26Z,"Can you please seed. I am at 60%. I have had this version of MUGEN for awhile and loved it, made my own additions even. Had to system restore because of a virus and lost it all. Went to the youtube video that had links but the links are outdated and don't work..please, I miss MUGEN!. All other versions pale in comparison. "
