,ashjames,2012-08-01T20:59Z,Please upload episode 9!!
,actorman46,2012-08-02T00:03Z,Episode 9 please. It's hard to look for it online without seeing spoilers.
,actorman46,2012-08-02T02:23Z,Grrr it's so annoying how people can't just post 9. Instead they have fakes up allover the place to make me sign up for stuff. I'm not doing it so just post it!
,Dakota85,2012-08-02T06:03Z,"Agreed actorman, i'm actually signed up to Torrentday and with some shows some weeks their the fastest ive ever seen, but then depending on whichever way the wind blows that week, you might not see a certain show for a few days at the moment, sometimes not even in .264 format its so frustrating lol. Its hard to read how quick things are when you know a show hasn't even been uploaded 24-48hrs after it aired :( lol."
