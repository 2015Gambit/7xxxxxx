SEED THIS!"
,violet1143,2012-07-26T08:51Z,Has anyone tried this on a Hackintosh? I'm aiming for a retail install rather than cobbling up a pre-baked distro.
,violet1143,2012-07-26T11:23Z,"Still no seeds? Damn, this one's a drag."
,pramod99,2012-07-26T11:26Z,Anyone knows how to use it with unibeast (Hackintosh) to make a bootabler USB flash drive
,violet1143,2012-07-26T12:11Z,"Oh, and another thing: this one's the .app, right?"

,VALENTlNO,2012-07-26T15:29Z,Very slow download. I really hope its worth it when done.
,Kobe_No_Means_No,2012-07-26T19:03Z,"I downloaded both popular 10.8 files, this one and the golden master version, they're EXACTLY the same. My recommendation is to download the other one as it has more seeders at the moment. Both work fine. 

golden master = retail. "
,Kobe_No_Means_No,2012-07-26T19:07Z,"Airplay only works on mid-2011 machines and up (I think there were some confusions about that.) Here are specs for Mountain Lion, notice older Macs are not supported.

,violet1143,2012-07-27T08:38Z,@Kobe_No_Means_No - You sure that this installer works fine? I'm already halfway through the download and I'm planning to use this for my Hackintosh.
,JanarBrokuaft,2012-07-27T08:40Z,"It does not work for me either! It really does finishes doing whatever It does when you launch It, then after the restart the PS X is still in 10.7.4… Any suggestions my brilliant pirates?"

,JanarBrokuaft,2012-07-27T10:22Z,"Is anyone doing this differently? From desktop i double click dmg, run installer, installer finishes normally, asks to restart, restart only to find out OS X is still on 10.7.4 (!). WTF? Does anyone know of this issue? How did you install it?"
,violet1143,2012-07-27T10:59Z,@JanarBrokuaft - Have you tried the other ML installers that are for download here on TPB?
,remaks69,2012-07-27T11:44Z,Sweet 914Kps !!!!!!
,mac-freak,2012-07-27T12:10Z,hey can someone confirm this is the .app that was downloaded and has not been modified?
,JanarBrokuaft,2012-07-27T12:30Z,"@violet1143 I’m downloading now the other one thats on here. I’ll ket you guys know if it works. But just out of mindfucked curiosity, why isn’t it installing? Anyone know the answer? "
,JanarBrokuaft,2012-07-27T12:43Z,@ violet1143 - I’m downloading the other one on here now. i’ll let you guys know if it works. But i’m still curious why it didn’t restart with ML installed??? Anyone?
,ProNithy,2012-07-27T13:03Z,"Just completed the download at 40kbps. Those fucking morrons won't seed.

Updated my mackintosh as well:(P"
,ProNithy,2012-07-27T13:06Z,"Start from the scratch as I did, will work JanarBrokuaft"
,violet1143,2012-07-27T14:35Z,@ProNithy - What do you mean? Install it via booting to the ESD?
,remaks69,2012-07-27T15:04Z,works like mint!
,JanarBrokuaft,2012-07-27T15:19Z,@ProNithy- I hope you’re not suggesting clean install… Defeats the point of upgrading. Anyone with an explanation to this rather odd and rare (no where on the internet) issue?
,VALENTlNO,2012-07-27T20:31Z,"worked perfectly fine for some reason my speakers have stopped working and the speaker icon is on top is not sliding to volume up nor the key board or system perf are of any help

any one know a way around?"

,NaoDarkness,2012-07-29T01:16Z,"@VALENTlNO - You need to start up into Safe Mode, do this:

1.Be sure your Mac is shut down.

2.Press the power button.

3.Immediately after you hear the startup tone, hold the Shift key. The Shift key should be held as soon as possible after the startup tone, but not before the tone.

4.Release the Shift key when you see the gray Apple icon and the progress indicator (looks like a spinning gear).

5.This will disable all but the core usability.

6.Turn off the mac and power up the mac as usual, that should fix your audio and any other issues, if not it's a hardware problem. "

,rascame69,2012-07-30T03:16Z,"Iphoto or Imovie will not update, is this because you purchased LION under your ID?  Is there a work around this?  Also I manual downloaded Iphoto 9.3.2 and IMovie 9.0.7, and it will not allow manual update, it give an error message saying 
""To update this application, sign in to the account you used to purchase it.""

Any help appreciated. "
,Corininha,2012-07-30T05:02Z,THIS IS NOT bought from AppStore as this is Golden Master. Build number 12A269. 
,Corininha,2012-07-30T05:06Z,Or this is really weird. GM and Stable build to have the exact same number... :-/
,violet1143,2012-07-30T10:50Z,@Corininha - That's because both GM and retail are essentially the same banana.
,guruteg,2012-07-30T18:11Z,"Thanks for your effort...but whichever way you used  to create the dmg file..can probably only be used to do a vanilla not upgrade..what you need is InstallESD.dmg which Kings420 is offering..I had to download twice before i could upgrade working like a charm..
Still A+++ for the effort..God Bless"
,scbjmshpv,2012-07-30T20:10Z,"i was able to put this thing on USB drive and boot from it and now installing, i'll update of success (if it happens) but for now i'm just installing it on old os x after that i'll try clean install and update it here.

thanks for the effort of good torrent."
,xgman1,2012-07-30T20:54Z,"If you can boot from it, you probably can do a clean install. How did you put it on a bootable usb drive?  Did you juts restore the dmg image in dick utility to the drive?"
,scbjmshpv,2012-07-30T21:08Z,"Thanks a million man, everything worked out fine i mean i upgraded it and than tried direct install and than clean install everything worked fine.

,aidwoods,2012-07-30T22:58Z,"soooo, what happens if we need to upgrade ?? it tells me i need your Apple ID info..."
,scbjmshpv,2012-07-31T04:57Z,"the apple ID and info won't make any trouble cause you might have bought it from store or have came with your new mac. i made new one and hadn't had problem with updates (it doesn't ask for any of that info ever again on updates, might be your password nothing else)"
