Sorry about the order of these files...

My advice for complete newbies to Thai would be to do these lessons in the following order:

""All About"" 
 Gives you a bit of background on the language and culture 

""Basic Boot Camp""  
Covers the usual 'hello, how are you' and teaches you to count 1 to a 1,000,000 etc...

""Absolute Beginner 1 & 2""  
50 situation based lessons to build your vocabulary, grammar and understanding of Thai

""Survival Phrases"" 
60 common phrases that will help you on your trip

""Beginner""

""Lower Intermediate""

Enjoy

Would you mind seeding a little more?"
,BangkokBadBoy,2012-08-03T12:55Z,I'll open the throttle for the next few nights... 
,yamr60,2012-08-07T16:36Z,These are good. Did you have the intermediate or advanced etc?
,ajarnmark,2012-08-12T05:13Z,"This is really great, and very helpful. Thanks for the share.
I hope we can see more of the series ie more advanced material, later on perhaps?
I'll seed this for at least a month, perhaps longer if I see people are still leeching from my connection."
,BangkokBadBoy,2012-08-12T06:25Z,"No probs...  Good to see some positive feedback, these lessons have helped me heaps too, hence the share... 

I don't have any more of the intermediate/advanced lessons but if you are already up to speed with all of these lessons, then maybe its time to start learning to read and write Thai... This is the best way to get fluent and pronounce your tones like a local... Easier than it looks, you just gotta put the hours in!!

,yamr60,2012-08-15T13:53Z,"the advanced lessons byt the looks of it are just audio blogs where the teacher reads out something.

The lower intermediate lessons here are half complete, still they're really good, it's like listening in on a 1-to-1 between a teacher and student. Teaches good thai as well.

Cheers."
