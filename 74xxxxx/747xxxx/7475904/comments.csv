,rcr29budcar,2012-07-26T09:27Z,"I've noticed allot of people complaining about stolen uploads.  They couldn't have been using tpb too long because its always been like that.  And just because someone uploads it first, in no way does that mean that they made it.  A few, yes, but 9 out of 10 uploaders on here get it from someone else.  I know you don't care, and your gonna keep calling them names, that from what i've seen, looks like things a 9 year old would say. Most of it doesn't make any sense, and I have no idea what they said.  And another user posted something earlier that you need to remember,   ""there is no honor amongst thieves"".  This is the pirate bay!  Your ""stealing"" illegal movies!  In NO way do you have the right to call someone else a thief!  Have you ever heard the saying, ""Thats like the pot calling the kettle black""?  That applies to you! The people calling uploaders thieves, and complining about them ""stealing"" someone else's work! Think before you speak! Or in this case type.  Thats all I got to say.  Not tryin to piss you off, but its true.
I'm out! Peace!

P.S. If you don't get the pot/kettle thing,  look it up!"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-07-26T10:09Z,It is kinda lame that they post the same crappy version over and over. Then you have to go and find out if it's actually new or just the same ol shit.
,rcr29budcar,2012-07-26T10:41Z,"@Bean-Bandit

I can totally agree with that. What i'm talking about is when people call the uploaders thieves and complain saying that they stole the upload from someone else when the reality is that its stealing when we (notice I said we) download movies, games, ect. from here.  It is very annoying to have so many of the same movie uploaded, but people should use some common sense before making accusations like that."
,rezabrando,2012-07-26T11:20Z,Doesn't TS mean recorded with a high-end camera and a separate audio source? The print in this is still shit.
,rezabrando,2012-07-26T11:21Z,It should be labeled as CAM NEW AUDIO. NOT TS.
,bullerbase12,2012-07-26T14:56Z,Worst Q ever  dont download this crap  you cant see anything  a  1  v  1
,dash34,2012-07-26T15:39Z,"lick my ass, take a sharp knife and shove it up your ass!! tvteam, ill giv u a team to clean my shit everyday along with you doing the same!!"
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-07-26T18:13Z,"For the n00bs, and God there is a lot of you on here. TS or Telesync only refers to the sound, it means that the sound comes directly from a line in the cinema, it has NOTHING to do with picture quality.

Just learn about things before complaining about them."
,trenken,2012-07-26T19:54Z,Only a fucking nerd would bitch to anyone for not knowing what telesync is. Fucking dweeb.
,goGators,2012-07-26T22:12Z,and only and asshole would bitch when someone tries to explain something that would've taken a little common sense to understand dont bitch and complain if you dont know wtf your doing or better yet stop downloading the shit
,goGators,2012-07-26T22:16Z,if the quality is bad post it stop whining like a little bitch on the rag get some tampons and mydol 
,dash34,2012-07-26T22:59Z,i just want tvteam to take a sharp knife and shove it up his ass !!!!!
,of_ghosts,2012-07-26T23:34Z,"In film production the term telesync is often used when the film is synced with the shutter speed and frame rate of the camera, as well as a direct link to the audio source. However, in reference to pirated content, the term more often than not, is referring only to the quality of audio, not image. And I believe this is generally understood and acceptable. 

And yes, I am a nerd... I'm also a film/video-maker. "
,CrazycookCrEwSaDe,2012-07-29T07:59Z,"I'd like to chime in about stolen content. As a P2p group that it is the release group for it's home site, we do take offense when the torrents are not uploaded properly and someone is spamming them. And for those of you that don't know TS (line Audio) refers to audio captured through earphone jacks, radio frequency, or directly from the projection booth.  "
,9Velja9,2012-08-05T12:31Z,"Hey little bitches, write A/V or don't write anything at all. Stop whining. -_-"
