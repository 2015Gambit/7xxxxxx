,bigmun,2012-08-20T07:22Z,cooldude - installation went smoothly but the keygen appears to be 7 numbers short so i cannot activate the license. what am i doing wrong? 
,cooldude187,2012-08-20T09:39Z,@ bigmun THE KEYGEN PROVIDES THE KEY WHICH IS SHORT BUT YOU JUST IGNORE THAT AND PROCEED AND FOLLOW THE STEPS WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED IT WILL SURELY GET LICENCED..
,bigmun,2012-08-21T05:37Z,"@cooldude187 - i am still not having luck. i am logged in as administrator (on windows 7 via bootcamp) and turned off UAC, and when i paste in the request code and hit the 'patch' button, i get this error: ""Make sure you can write to current directory"". i still have 29 days left to activate so i have some time to figure it out. thanks for being patient with me - i'm new here.
