Lock Folder XP is a new security tool that lets you lock your files, folders, and drives with your personal password. Locking folders, files, and drives also effectively protects you from malicious programs, such as viruses, worms, and trojans. Locking files, folders, and drives is the best way to guarantee that nobody accidentally or intentionally gets access to your financial, health, private, and confidential information. And because locking your files, folders, or drives makes them invisible, they cannot be deleted, damaged, or harmed in any other way. We also advise you to get Lock Folder XP if you have a laptop and travel frequently.
