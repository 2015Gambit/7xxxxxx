* Plot :

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham City is in a state of peace. Under powers granted by the Dent Act, Commissioner James Gordon has nearly eradicated violent and organized crime. Gordon feels guilty about the cover-up of Harvey Dent's crimes, but decides that the city is not ready to hear the truth. While following a lead in the abduction of a congressional representative, Gordon's confessional speech falls into the hands of terrorist leader Bane. Gordon is shot in the process of escaping and promotes patrol officer John Blake to detective, allowing Blake to report directly to him in the hospital.

As Batman has disappeared from Gotham, so too has Bruce Wayne, locking himself inside Wayne Manor. Wayne Enterprises is crumbling after he invested in a clean energy project proposed by board member Miranda Tate, but shut it down after learning that the fusion core at its heart could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. Both BlakeΓÇöwho has deduced Batman's identityΓÇöand Gordon implore Bruce to return as Batman, but Alfred Pennyworth resigns in protest out of concern for Bruce's failing health.

Bane attacks the stock exchange and bankrupts Bruce, forcing him to relinquish control of Wayne Enterprises. Correctly suspecting that his business rival, John Daggett, employed Bane to aid in an aggressive take-over of his company, Wayne entrusts Tate to keep full control out of Daggett's hands. Daggett confronts Bane, but is killed so that Bane can take over his construction resources. Following a trail left by cat burglar Selina Kyle, Batman confronts Bane, who says that he took over the League of Shadows following the death of Ra's al Ghul. Bane physically cripples Batman and places him in a prison from which escape is virtually impossible. The other inmates relate the story of the only person to escape from the prison, a young child believed to be the offspring of Ra's al Ghul.
