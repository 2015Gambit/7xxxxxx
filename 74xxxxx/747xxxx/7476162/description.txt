NOTES!
I work on the video source and use some filtered to change the saturation, brightness, contrast and color, change the AR for a better view. . .
I try to clear the audio, so i remove the noise, reduced the bass boost from the audio, modify some peach here and there and finally sync the audio
. . . so take`it or leave`it.
