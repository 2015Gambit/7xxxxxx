Depending on how many people are seeding you can normally expect a drop off in speed when downloading new torrents. Complaining about it just makes you look ignorant and stupid, which I take from your comments is probably about right.

Also, complaining about a pirated movie that is costing you nothing is like stealing a watch from someone then complaining that it's a fake.

Get over it n00b.

I look forward to your expletive strewn reply, though I won't reply to it myself. "
,piratehari,2012-07-27T16:40Z,"its not fake at all, wat makes u say so ????????"
,piratehari,2012-07-28T10:38Z,thats because there aren't any seeders!
