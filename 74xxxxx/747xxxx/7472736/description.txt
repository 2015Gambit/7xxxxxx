This is OS X Lion 10.7.4 Retail .iso image. This image is compressed to a 7z file and then split into (7) 650MB 7z files.

NOTE: This image installs slow on VMware. It is NOT a bad image. Have patience and eventually the installation will begin on VMware. I don't know why id does that but I can assure you this .iso does work so please don't post "bad image" or any thing of the sort until you give it a shot. 

Also, once you get it working please purchase the OS from the Apple App Store. Don't be the one to ruin it for everyone.
