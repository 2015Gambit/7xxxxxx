Here is the authentic bootleg audio of Anders Behring Breiviks closing speech to the court on June 22 2012. This recording was made without the courts permission, and atleast one brave Norwegian politician is under investigation for uploading it to youtube.

The original youtube rip was 129mb but has no seeds. I have found another, split into 4 and uploaded on youtube by user: opluchting, big thanks! 

I have put these 4 together and am uploading here.

Freedom of speech above all!

Enjoy :)

Oh, this torrent will not be dead in a few hrs. If it ever dies, leave a comment asking for reseed and Ill hook you up!
