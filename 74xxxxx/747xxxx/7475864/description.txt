Presenting the linguistic basis for courses and projects on translation, contrastive linguistics, stylistics, reading and discourse studies, this book illustrates grammatical usage through authentic texts from a range of sources, both spoken and written.

This new edition has been thoroughly rewritten and redesigned to include many new texts and examples of language in use. Key features include: chapters divided into modules of class-length materials; a wide variety of authentic texts and transcriptions to illustrate points of grammar and to contextualise structure; clear chapter and module summaries enabling efficient class preparation and student revision; exercises and topics for individual study; answer key for analytical exercises; comprehensive index; select biography; suggestions for further reading; and a companion website. This up-to-date descriptive grammar is a complete course for first degree and postgraduate students of English, and is particularly suited for those whose native language is not English.
