From Wiki:


The Buggles[2][3] were an English New Wave duo consisting of Trevor Horn (vocals, bass guitar, guitar) and Geoff Downes (keyboards). They are best known for their 1979 debut single Video Killed the Radio Star that was #1 on the singles charts of sixteen countries.[4] Its music video was the first to be shown on MTV in the U.S. at 12:01 on 1 August 1981.

Shortly after Downes' move to the band Asia and the failure of the Buggles' second album, Adventures in Modern Recording, the group came to an end in 1981. However, Downes and Horn have been performing Buggles' songs together since 1998.


The Age of Plastic 1980 (2000)


The Age of Plastic is the first album by synthpop/New Wave group The Buggles, which consisted of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, released on Island Records on 4 February 1980. The album is a concept album, with themes of intense nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology. It followed the success of their first single, "Video Killed the Radio Star", which had reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart in 1979. Three subsequent singles, "Living in the Plastic Age", "Clean Clean" and "Elstree" were released from the album, but met with considerably less success. Allmusic, in their retrospective review, called it "a fun record that doesn't need to be taken too seriously", writing "it would be difficult to find a record from this era that sounds half as good. Pop rarely reaches these heights."
