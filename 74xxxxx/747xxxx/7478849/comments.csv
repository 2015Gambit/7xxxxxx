It's an mp4, not a zip."
,lishan89,2012-07-27T06:29Z,Why troll sigh? Can't we just all get along?

,TheMadBro,2012-07-27T06:45Z,"Not so much a troll as a misclick. Sorry about that!!! eztv ettv. I didnt pay close enough attention. And I dont know if the eztv is legit... I wasnt going to find out.

Again sorry. Honest mistake."
