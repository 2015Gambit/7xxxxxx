What happen with 720p?"
,RadioActiveX,2012-07-30T05:05Z,"You're welcome...

I'm not doing two sets (720p & 1080p) like TR108. On some movies, I did 720 and mostly action movies done 1080... I just don't have the patience for two encodes sorry..."
,MadMango,2012-08-29T13:56Z,"RadioActiveX thanks for the great work of yours! You and TR108 are my heroes :P. I understand your unwillingess to upload movies in 720p formats (thats reasonable, I would do the same myself). 

Unfortunately, while my PC DOES support 1080p videos and therefore can play your movies (i.e. in WMP classic), iTunes won't recognise them and when I play them in iTunes they're so so laggy. So, is there any way to convert them in 720p from 1080p so I can enjoy them?

(Also, any chance of encoding greek subs as well? That would be great!)"
,RadioActiveX,2012-08-31T05:05Z,"@MadMango Yeah for some reason iTunes won't play my 1080p movies either, they're all laggy and according to iTunes it is because I don't have a ""HTPC"" enabled monitor or video card..

Anyhow, my advice is to download VLC Media player and play them with that if you are going to watch on your computer, it is by far better than WMP and fixes the iTunes problem.. Now if you watch it on your apple tv just add it to your iTunes library and it will play just fine there because the AppleTV does support the whole ""HTPC"" problem.

As far as the greek subs go, I OCR the PGS (Subtitle) streams from the blu-ray disc, and most blu-rays that I come across don't have more languages than English, Spanish, French, Portuguesse..  But you can go to subscene.com or opensubtitles.org and download them there and just RENAME the .SRT file the same as the movie and put it in the same folder as the movie as well(eg. Eagle Eye.srt) [This will only work with VLC not in iTunes or Apple TV]..."
