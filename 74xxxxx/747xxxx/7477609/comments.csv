,GhostofMackisGod,2012-08-20T09:10Z,"Its so sad that this fat douchebag poser makes millions off idiots who listen to his shitty ""music"". How far we have fallen."
,TtToker,2012-09-01T09:49Z,"Holy shit, this guy is so gangster. God forgives, I don't, disc 2 - God doesn't eat, I rape my mouth with food! I hate this douche bag and I'll bet money God does too. Obese Diabetic asshole telling his fans with no taste in music how he has nothing in common with ""God"". It sounds like those ""Gangsta sounds"" he makes after his ""hard core""ny lines were influenced by his sleep apnea mix tape (you know, the tape when they recorded him sleeping to see how bad this fat ass had it). at least he grew that triple chin hiding beard so he doesn't look too much worse than the chick from the movie Precious.. He'd sell more albums if he didn't put his pictures on the cover, what is he in a church asking for forgiveness for his lack of forgiveness (& being fat)? ""Oh lord, forgive me for not forgiving and being so fucking fat"" I don't know what look he was going for but, he's fat.. haha 
great quality uploader (Though awful quality ""music"") thanks for keeping money out of this ass's wallet and chains off his fat neck."

BTW,opinions are like assholes, everyone has one."
