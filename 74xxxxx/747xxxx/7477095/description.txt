Narco Bling
Using the wealth, culture and seized bounty of Mexican drug traffickers - narco bling - as a jumping off point, correspondent Mariana van Zeller explores the strange and dangerous netherworld of the largest and most successful of the Mexican drug cartels, led by one of the world's most wanted criminals.
Expensive houses, Swiss watches and swimming pools; for the heads of Mexico's drug cartels, money is truly no object. And that money can carry on giving prestige after death: some crime lords even invest in air-conditioned and bulletproof mausoleums. This documentary is a behind the scenes look at some of the world's most notorious criminals, their opulent lifestyles, and the way their complex operations were ran. As experts deconstruct some of the world's most infamous cartels, you'll learn the truth about drug lords and their endless lust for gold, fast cars, and the good life.
