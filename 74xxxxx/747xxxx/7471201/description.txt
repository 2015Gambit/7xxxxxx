You are the Nomad Soul, inhabiting bodies of the dead to continue your quest to stop the menacing Astaroth's rebellion. With the help of several key characters, you will venture the worlds of Omikron, seeking out the incantations to bring Astaroth to his doom.

Unfortunately the PC version has too many issues, so I thought I'd try to emulate the dreamcast version using nullDC. I downloaded the ROM and eventually got it going so well, that I think I'll put the PC version to rest for good. 

Using the controls with this version is way better for Xpadder freaks like myself, than the complex array for the PC version. One issue with the ROM though, is that the person who ripped it, removed some of the audio, including the intro theme, oh well, not to worry, once you get into the game, there's no sound issues; but right at the start there's a few crackly sounds.

Just install the installer I have set up, and take a look at the picture at the end of installation for additional info, setup Xpadder (Optional), then use the shortcut on the desktop to kick the game over, enjoy the game. 

Xpadder is included with profiles for Xbox360 and PS3.
