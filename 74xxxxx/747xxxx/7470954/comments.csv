,GothMikau,2012-07-24T23:55Z,"Great torrent.  Good speed, and good a/v quality, for a cam.  However, I would recommend that one sees the movie first in either regular theater or IMAX (I suggest the latter) because then it's a true experience.  Then after that you can get this torrent and watch the film to your heart's content, but seeing in it the theater is unlike anything.  But still, good work Froggie!"

No one can upload a BluRay version because this is simply a cam. How do you expect someone to get a hold of BR when the movie was only released in theatres only a few days ago? Even asking for a R5 or a Screener would be pushing it, let alone a BR.

This movie was an above average action movie. PERIOD.

It was needlessly slow and plodding at times, had poor character development for the major new characters, and preposterous opening sequence (even by superhero movie standards) Since fanboys cite how ""gritty and realistic"" this version of batman is I would expect less ridiculously unrealistic action scenes. Its basically 2 1/2 hours of filler followed by a fistfight on the courthouse steps between Bane and Batman to end the movie. Total cheese.

Same plot as Rocky 3. Bane beats up Batman, Batman goes into exile and comes back and beats up Bane. Add in some silly action scenes and a nuclear bomb and call it Batman.

AVERAGE MOVIE fanboys. Get off Nolan and Bale's dicks."

The plot loopholes in this are frequent and HUGE.

SPOILERS BELOW....

Catwoman and Robin don't need to be in this. They do not help tell the story, they offer no unique insights into what is happening. The two fights between Bane and Batman are not exactly inspired. Unless you consider 'I punch you, you punch me, I punch you again, you punch me' to be inspired. LAME. Really just awful.

The first time Batman and Bane fight, Bane takes all of Batman's punches without even flinching. Second time, for some reason, he cannot.

The pit Bane was born in, the hellish prison? Yeah, it isn't bad at all. Some nice folks their and master doctors who can fix and rehabilitate a broken back in a matter of weeks with nothing more than a rope and good old fashion folksy wisdom.

My favorite part was when Robin shows up at Wayne manor and reveals he ""just knew"" that Wayne was Batman. Just had a feeling about it. WTF!!!

Check this out.....not only does Batman recover from a broken back in a hole in the ground, it is in some foreign country. Batman is broke yet somehow finds his way back to Gotham (which is completely locked down by U.S. military forces) bypasses those military fortresses, and spends some time putting some flammable material on the side of a building in the shape of a bat, leaves a flare to be found by Gordon when his sentence of exile on the ice is carried out, and all of this takes place in a matter of minutes in the film. You don't see Batman doing ANY of those things.

AWFUL movie."

,GhostofMackisGod,2012-07-31T14:57Z,"@f20cs13. Yes, we arent intelligent enough to understand the brilliant vision of Nolans epic universe. A universe where the protagonist gets his back broken and goes to a prison in Asia to do some push ups for a couple weeks and come back good as new.

Then the viewer is supposed to assume that Wayne then walks across the desert with no supplies, reaches civilization, and despite being penniless and a worldwide celebrity manages to get back to Gotham which is on military lockdown, without anyone knowing. All of this happens off camera in the span of 2 or 3 minutes.

And lets not forget Nolans epic final battle scene. 400 cops mindlessly charge the courthouse led by batman. No thought of tactics or strategy, just blindly run towards the courthouse where Bane is waiting. Of course once they get there, they dont shoot Bane, Batman gets in a fistfight with him while hundreds of armed combatants leave them alone to fight each other. Very realistic. If only we were intelligent enough to understand Nolans vision.......

This movie is a great piece of entertainment. For children under 12. Stop trying to act as if people who call bullshit on the gaping plot holes and cheesy scenes, arent ""intelligent"" enough to understand.

I hate trying to explain Christopher Nolan movies to simple people with a small scope of the overall picture of things...so...if you enjoy thinking, watch this movie in a better quality of course...and if you like brainless things, got watch project X."
,BostonRippah,2012-08-01T06:56Z,"If you're like me and you have already seen this in theaters this is a very watchable copy, i personally downloaded it with the plan to watch it over and over again without paying 12 bucks every time! Great UL froggie100, keep it up!"
,Bradshaw4,2012-08-01T09:38Z,"Well, I downloaded it and got it pretty fast. The quality was decent but after about 4 or 5 minutes my sound went out on it. Also, my ISP shut me down after downloading it (I have Cox). Has any one else's audio shut out? and is there a way to download from torrents without my ISP from flagging me?"
,nigapls,2012-08-01T10:04Z,"molkhi is on drugs, not sure if he's 10yrs old or not but this movie (especially the script) was crafted for tweens.....at best. for a ""man"" who has seen hundreds of films maybe your next comment should come after you've seen a couple thousand.....like the rest of us."
