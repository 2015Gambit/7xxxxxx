,xpmule,2012-07-27T22:31Z,"when did we turn into a ""we""
extremezone split into 2 people now ?

honestly and i don't why so many people go to soooo much effort to make it look like they are a scene group on a torrent site.

ANYONE could download a groups hard work and upload it..
Half the people around here couldn't tell the difference between and uploader and a cracker.

sorry but im not too impressed with people that steal other peoples torrents.. you bitched about this happening to you and strangly you have been doing that to some other guys for ages. How many of your torrents have the file called 
""EXTREMEZONE.AKA.PIRATEPEDIA.IS.A.PIECE.OF.SHIT-ZAMUNDA.NET.jpg""
?
Your hillarious, run in the forum cause someone (one of the major uploaders here) beat you to uploading a game
that you claim is yours but its just the iso released the scene group which would have the same hash no matter who created the torrent.

Im sure your cheer leaders will love my post too.
But i don't care their idiots !
They don't care where things come from even when one of your releases has a file called ""your a piece of shit"" in it.
which means if another thief comes along all these cheerleaders will start praising that guy instead in a heart beat

""We need anything you can offer as early releases,seedboxes,links,accounts,etc""

Hope someone feeds you a honey pot LOL
Or just sit back and wait for the next fbi group sting.. targets like you will be the first in cuffs"
