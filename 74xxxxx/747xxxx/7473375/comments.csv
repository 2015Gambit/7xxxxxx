,myrdok,2012-07-31T13:35Z,"This may seem like a dumb question, but why do you have most of your files in this unknown file format as opposed to a mkv or mp4 or whatnot.  So you have any suggestions as far as a program that will convert this style to mkv, mp4 or avi.  Those 3 are the only ones that will play on my blu-ray player.  I would love to use your files as opposed to others due to quality, availability, etc, but i cant at this moment."
