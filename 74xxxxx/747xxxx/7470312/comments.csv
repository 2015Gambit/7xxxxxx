,Darkpanther44,2012-07-25T06:08Z,I think that this comic is trying to say that life is a comic book and we need to stop worrying  and we need to let go and see the world as the kids in the comic  see it
,Street_Disciple,2012-07-25T06:43Z,"I think this is saying perception is reality.  
As someone who's done acid about 30 times I feel like it has changed my thinking patterns making me able to see perspectives I previously couldn't.  It allows you interpret situations in ways your brain and body wouldn't allow you to under normal circumstances. "
,Street_Disciple,2012-07-25T06:45Z,"I also think its saying our generation hasn't been able to define itself like previous generations have been able to.  Possibly because there are so many factors like media, schools etc that want to dictate how perceive the world around us and form our world view.  Those are my thoughts anyway....."
