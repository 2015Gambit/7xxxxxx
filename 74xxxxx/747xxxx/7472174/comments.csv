,JamsBand,2012-07-25T06:51Z,"Thanks ChattChitto.
I found that if you block interent access it will still work but only as the 30 day trial even with they keys provided. If you try to verify the keys they do not verify. I started having this problem with the 7 and same with this one. Like I said it works but says it is not regististered. "
[V],ChattChitto,2012-07-25T10:51Z,Register it online then block it :)
,gustavonedel,2012-07-26T06:31Z,"And how do I block it? I can't even register online, I'he tried all 4 serial and passwords.. Any help? Thanks.."
,newbrownshoe,2012-07-27T05:40Z,"this worked for me...
1. TurnOff Internet connection.
2. Run ChattChitto's fantastic installer, until it asks for Rego.
3. Copy and paste one of the user names and serial number combinations, from ChattChitto's fantastic Serial number section, and continue installation.
4. After the program installs, it will try to connect to the net. Just close the window. 
5. Check the program Help menu. If it does NOT have a Enter Serial Key option, you have installed correctly.
6. Using your firewall, Block the program from calling home. (Plenty of instructions on the net).
7. Log onto TPB and thank ChattChitto for always having trusted programs. 

(ps. Would love an invite to CC.com)"

,3b3ast3,2012-07-30T18:54Z,"Listen up whiners and assholes,its very simple to install this.stop shitting yourselfs.All you have to do is turn off you internet connection to install and everytime you run it to make a tutorial or anything else make sure your internet is off when you launch camtasia or when your recording a video you can turn on the internet,so you can continue your tutorial as you wish.Dont be dumb,think smart ;]"
,macha,2012-07-31T06:10Z,Thanks a lot buddy. You're the pirate! Nice work.

,newbrownshoe,2012-08-02T04:45Z,Trying to mail @ChattChitto is like chasing shadows:) The 'contact' pg needs rego. Whats the secret??
,trader007,2012-08-02T09:17Z,"Has anyone using WinXP been able to get this to work? If so, what firewall software did you use or other steps did you take? Thanks!"
,heartattack360,2012-08-06T11:58Z,"i haven't downloaded this yet, but trader007 you should just update to windows 7 if you can, or windows 8 soon, because especially with windows 8 coming out xp is outdated."
,bak_009,2012-08-08T18:47Z,Gr8. Just follow the instructions given by @newbrownshoe and it will definitely work without any problems. 
,sisirTPB,2012-08-08T21:28Z,Thanks for the upload! Good Speed!!
,mrmouth,2012-08-11T22:14Z,"Im able to follow simple instructions. This guys uploads rarely come with precise instructions. Kind of difficult to understand where you register so I did after installation and that didnt work. But it contacts the server no matter what you do. If you block it the program hangs. So apparently these serials are bunk? I don't know, just crack it. I found a cracked version of 8 it it works flawlessly."
,stinkyKuntz,2012-08-12T05:42Z,"It works if you listen to newbrownshoe,it installs ubder techsmith add to list of blocks in security through control panel uncheck and your set ...re-establish internet and your good to go ;;;;;Thanx Cheeto was good upload"
,stinkyKuntz,2012-08-12T12:35Z,"it downloads under techsmith ,turn off internet connect ,NETWORK SHARING CENTER,disable,then install add crack to username and serial then go to SECURITY IN CONTROL CENTER press block program ubcheck,if not there add program under tech smith and block,resume internet connect in NETWORK SHARING CENTER you should be good to go"
,stinkyKuntz,2012-08-12T20:34Z,"block it through control panel then security ,or antivirus program,if it not working its still getting through to handshake with camtasia studio,window 7 works fine ,follow newbrownshoes direction it works, there or no maybe's,your just not following directions"
,sisirTPB,2012-08-12T20:52Z,Hey guys what is the name of the song on the software. Its very sweet!

,niecht,2012-08-15T14:08Z,"Hello while installing I get this error who aparait:

Error 1904 Module D: / Program Files (x86) / TechSmith / Camtasia Studio 8 / CamtasiaFilter.dll failed to register. HRESULT-2147024703. Contact your supprt staff

I download and install visual basic C + + 2008 sp1 (x64) (x86) but it does not change

Version 7 with no problem but with version 8 can not install

I have windows 7 64 bit premium famillial

HELP"
,dphresh85,2012-08-17T20:21Z,I added Camtasia to firewall then denied it access. It worked the first time i opened camtasia but then when I closed it and reopened the program it connected to the internet and couldnt validate my serial. Now Im back to 30 day trial. Has anyone succesfully blocked camtasia from connecting via firewall?
,kustcom,2012-08-21T10:35Z,"""Has anyone using WinXP been able to get this to work? If so, what firewall software did you use or other steps did you take? Thanks!""

Your using XP and it's late 2012.... how about you go search for windows 7 +cracks first before downloading this..."
,kustcom,2012-08-21T15:47Z,"People still having problems:
1. Disconnect internet by unplugging the ethernet cable from your pc. Or turn off wireless.

2. Install camtasia studio using the provided camtasia+serials.exe. During install it will ask you if you want to send anon usage statistics - select no. It will ask you if you want to intergrate with Powerpoint, select yes if you have it. Towards the end it will ask if you want to use it as a trial or enter registration info. Go back to the camtasia+serials.exe and get the serials, grab the first one: click name copy and then go back to installer and paste. Go back to exe and select serial and copy then go back to installer and click paste in the serial section.

3. Finish the install and run the program. It will complain about not being about to connect to the servers, just click OK and ignore it.

4. click start menu and type in the search bar ""firewall"" then hit enter, or select ""Windows Firewall"" (if you use another firewall other than the default use that)

5. Click ""inbound rules"" on the LEFT hand pane -> on the right hand pane click ""new rule"".

6. Select ""program"" hit next

7. hit ""browse"" and direct it to the installation directory. Typically this is: C:Program FilesTechSmithCamtasia Studio 8 or: C:Program Files (x86)TechSmithCamtasia Studio 8 if your on a 64bit system.
Select CamtasiaStudio.exe and click open. Then Click next on the previous firewall screen below the browse button.

8. You now have 3 options, Allow, Allow if secure and block. Select Block and click next.

9. make sure all domain, public and private are ticked and hit next.

10. Give it a name like ""camtasia_studio"" and hit finish.

11. Do the same thing for ""Outbound Rules"".

12. Plug internet back in and enjoy.... If you still have problems and the program becomes blocked then uninstall it and clean your registry using ""Piriform CCleaner"" or some regedit tool. Reinstall and this time go through the same proceedure as above but this time everytime after you want to use the program just unplug internet start it up and then plug internet back in... simple.

HF, THANKS TO ChattChitto... awesome job guys. "

,bayshafe,2012-08-27T01:36Z,@Kustcom; Windows XP is one of the best operating systems. The new Windows are mostly shit.
,smileybates,2012-08-27T08:46Z,"Common children, this is so simple. All you need to do is run a program such as ""fiddler"" to see what the program is trying to connect to.  YOU DON'T NEED A FIREWALL.  Just open notepad as administrator, open ""C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts"", then add this line:

127.0.0.1	activation.cloud.techsmith.com

Done."
