""Failed to find a graphics set.""
Help, please!"
,CCnOSnBT,2012-07-27T22:03Z,"have a look at the readme.txt in opengfx-0.4.4-all.zip for the graphic set

on Mac OSX you should unpack the following zip files

opengfx-0.4.4-all.zip to  ~/Documents/OpenTTD/baseset
openmsx-0.3.1-all.zip to ~/Documents/OpenTTD/gm
opensfx-0.2.3-all.zip to ~/Documents/OpenTTD/data

have fun :)"
