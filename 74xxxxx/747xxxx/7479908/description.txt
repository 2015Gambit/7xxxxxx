This contains the official 2012 squads and players for FIFA 11
the team-formations and players are converted from FIFA 12
I use it to play online withhope you like it!


Installation:
1. extract the data from the zip archive
2. copy to FIFA 11 folder
3. Start FIFA 11
4. Create new profile (old squads-savegame dont work anymore)
5. ENJOY!


notes:
- if you make a backup of the 2 old files "data0.bh" and "data0.big" you can easly switch between your old squads and new squads by copy them
- your old savegames dont work with the 2012-squads
  (if you want to use them again: see note 1)
- Some new players that are being added may have small problems with their name or their heads when you play online
- You will notice that some teams dont contain players, because these teams dont exist in FIFA 12
