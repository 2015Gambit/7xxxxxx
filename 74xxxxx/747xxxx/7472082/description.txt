I'm back. I've tested PhotoShop6, what a buggy program. Random times it crashes without interaction and you are wondering why, but i don't know. I have a AMD FX-8150 and 16GB RAM, this should be enough, but the PS need to set up a higher priority in the task-manager and it runs fine.

This time a 3-in-1 picture from my favorite -  Ella Set 218.  
It has become just a little bit freestyle, I had no idea, probably the summer hole in my head.

Finally i want to say, i hope that someone has a membership of the FG's website or slowquin makes things a little further, make you?
Otherwise we have to wait that 'Anonymous' upload it, or if I find a set in the Internet, I will upload it. I have no membership, please don't ask me for a new set.


Best regards and have a nice day
