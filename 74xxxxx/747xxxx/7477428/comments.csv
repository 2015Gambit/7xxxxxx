,whollysheet,2012-07-27T16:32Z,are you even seeding this? 
,brimack67,2012-07-29T20:12Z,Yes it's seeding. For some reason the tracker is seeding very slow since i uploaded it. I alloted it 500k/sec and yet it's rarely going over 50k so i guess ppl just have to be patient until its complete and there are more peers.
