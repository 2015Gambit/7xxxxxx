,juvemp01,2012-07-25T06:42Z,@blah546 just letting you know you didnt spoil it for me as i didnt read your comment till after
,TioFEAR,2012-07-25T06:44Z,must not scream . . . IT HAS A FUCKING PASSWORD!!!!
,Fritz.,2012-07-25T07:08Z,"actually blah546 makes me laugh.

regardless of his one liner the movie is going to be the exact same, and in a month nobody is even going to care about it anymore.

however, blah546 will still be a pathetic little man with such a meaningless life that he has the time to enjoy being an ass clown on pirate bay.

it makes me feel better to know I am not him :)"
,StillAlive_Jay,2012-07-25T08:21Z,"This is fucking bullshit cam file.
Some dickhead comes in and shoots the whole audience with an AR-15"
,xXTheGoonXx,2012-07-25T09:56Z,"@blah546, spoiling the movie proves that you like horse cock up your ass. You fucking faggot, kill yourself after you read this. "
,xXTheGoonXx,2012-07-25T09:58Z,"@StillAlive_Jay, everyone knows you're a fucking liar. Shoot yourself with an AR-15, and make sure you record it. Thanks."
,Airgunner2012,2012-07-25T10:41Z,blah546 will now get band and comments deleted! anyway
,saifeee,2012-07-25T12:13Z,I heard that this is best batman so far..i was searching for better quality and i found it at batman.conradbf.com  so i will watch it tonight. can't wait :)
,Nephilim22,2012-07-25T14:01Z,"M=9 
The movie is a great movie and it should, BUT it could have been better! Id gave it a 10 but it is very slow and does jump without details leaving you to try to come up with a mixture of the comic book and what Nolan might think! What im saying is that you only have to watch it once and you wont miss anything!"
,You_Muppet,2012-07-25T14:10Z,"Like the description says ""not the best source but watchable"". I'd give it V & A = 6.

Thanks S4A and all seeders."
,saint84,2012-07-25T18:40Z,"wrong timing :

,saint84,2012-07-25T18:43Z,my fault . was still dl the movie thats why 
,godzilla1987,2012-07-25T20:44Z,"FULL LENGTH MOVIE ALL 2 HR 36 min are here v6 a 6
not great but watchable"
,aquanovix,2012-07-25T22:21Z,"@juvemp01 lmaololol....he definitely spoiled it for you, otherwise you wouldn't have written anything"
,skyvillage,2012-07-25T22:59Z,Can't spoil anything for me; it's just another stupid batman movie
,ltcomdata,2012-07-26T03:35Z,"I only read 1st part of blah546's message and no i haven't seen the movie so i got spoiled a bit, but i went to the movie and saw it on big screen, I wanted to read the rest of blah546's comment today but it was already deleted, did he give away the ending also?"
,ceegronlee,2012-07-26T05:04Z,bane's voice was a joke. i couldn't take that shit seriously. sounded fucking hilarious 
,bled500,2012-07-26T22:06Z,"a/v? stop bithin, it's free!"
,legio9,2012-07-27T08:27Z,"Cam or not, the end result is another torrent of poor quality barely watchable.


V: 5
A: 3 

Scene4all: you slowly become the referral in the standard for mediocrity. Why not try to aim for the best instead?"
,TurnRiva,2012-07-27T11:30Z,"Best of the cams out atm, better than 26k. 
Overall decently watchable. Prob A6/V6 for a cam."
,machspee,2012-07-28T14:53Z,"No offense to the uploader but are you guys that desperate? All of these copies of TDKR are really crappy and unwatchable. Iam not going to say watch it in theater (though it is awesome to watch there) but why not wait for a Bluray or DVD rip until november? 

Its a shame you have to watch a $250 million movie in these shitty cams.  Or wait atleast for R5 versions which will release within next 2 months."
,legio9,2012-07-30T19:30Z,"Love the way people comment or rate """"good for a cam"" ...I wonder if they rate their lunch compared to dog shit too?

This is an EXCELLENT, FANTASTIC version compared to caveman's drawing on walls done with rock or crayons doodling done by a fully lobotomized and sedated moron.

Now..cam or not, compared to something ""watchable"" in a decent way, like ALL other current versions: it is a complete waste of bandwidth and an INSULT to technology and, thus,  is rated by this unique standard:

ALL versions as of this date (July 30th)

V: 3
A: 2 
M: ....its a question of personal taste."
,trixrabbit13,2012-07-31T21:32Z,lol bitching about quality ...because you payed so much for it? fucking dildos
,luciano.duarte,2012-08-29T22:33Z,"V=5
