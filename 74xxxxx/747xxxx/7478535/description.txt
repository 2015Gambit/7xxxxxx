For the love of Aiko4.  

Once upon a time, there was a sharecg.com user named redviper, a God who had uploaded most of the 'highest rated' items.  Then he/she was no more.  Maybe the account was hacked, maybe something else.  Regardless, it was a sad loss for those who love Aiko4! RedViper's work included: school uniforms, swimsuits, leatards, tennis dress, 'combat' outfits, strategically taped vibrators, a dirty warehouse, a backyard pardise, and a nice python 'shader kit' which gives your Aiko4 a wonderful soap-coating or tan-lines matching (for example) the Daz3D basic-wear swim/pantie set.

The foolish mortal that I am, I assumed redviper's work would live forever at sharecg, so I did not save the individual ZIPs.  Alas, they are all gone, so what is attached is a carefully cleaned ZIP of redviper things from my runtime. All of redviper's items should work, plus there are a few extra texture sets - all still active at sharcg.com.  Mopar's racing swimsuit texture didn't seem to apply correctly under PoserPRO-2012, but his original is still at sharecg.com in case you want to manually reload them.

redviper certainly isn't dead. He/She created a new account named 'Redviper2012', so if you love Aiko4, please go 'follow' this new RedViper as encouragement.
