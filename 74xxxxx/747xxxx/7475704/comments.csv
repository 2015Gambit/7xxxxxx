Thanks YIFY. Great as usual.

Can anyone tell me if anywhere on the Pirate Bay site there is some sort of guideline for rating torrents. This one has been rated 1, 7, 9. 10 and 100 by different raters. It defeats the purpose of  informing the downloaders of its quality, if everyone uses a different scale by which to judge. And yet they assume everyone else understands their reasoning and motives."

,13000432,2012-08-21T05:26Z,"Hi, YIFY.  Been downloading some of your items for quite some time now.  Just a question, how were you able to provide a torrent ahead of the official release?"
,supertwat,2012-08-23T20:39Z,Dude wat conversion software did u use.
,abernick00,2012-08-31T19:42Z,"@nowandever...
    there is NO copy protection left on an .Mp4 or .avi or any of the rips... how do you think they get the video in the first place???   There are a couple things that could be going wrong...  1. you are using crappy settings or a crappy burning prog    2. you are buying the cheap discs ( you should be buying Verbatim NO MATTER WHAT, maybe Sony, they have worked for me in the past, but Verbatim's are the best...)  If you have been burning these videos to a disc and using say ""memorex"", you are STRAINING THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR PS3 LASER!!!)     IF YOU ARE ftP'ING them over to your HD somehow, then it is a PS3 settings thing.    NOT copyright.         3.   Your Ps3 laser is already gone or going to break.   When systems read off of cheap discs or even the best ones, they have to ""strain"" to see the info. Just like a human has to strain when looking at something far away....   Eventually needing glasses.             My suggestion.   STOP WATCHING THESE downloads on your video game systems!!     buy a new/newer computer, and hook your computer up to your TV via an HDMI cable, then, no discs, no lasers, no problem!   just play them through VLC!"
,abernick00,2012-08-31T21:51Z,"@13000432
and anyone else wondering how movies get released early....    
   The most common way is through a movie rental or sales company (blockbuster video-if there are any left) or Best Buy, Walmart,,,,, most movies , they receive the shipment of 1 to 4 weeks in  advance. (I was a General Manager for the Largest entertainment distributor in the world, we saw games like Batma : Arkham Asylum / City more than a month in advance."
,abernick00,2012-08-31T22:17Z,"@nowandever


    Your problem has NOTHING to do with the copy protection!!!!!!   read the paragraph i wrote for you below.      and when you respond, answer my questions....   are you burning it to disc, then inserting it into the ps3???  what type of discs have  you been using??      9 ps3s outta 20 experience ""laser death""....   I fix probably 15 a month by replacing the piece....  most cases are because people download a movie, and burn it to the walmart/staples CRAPPY dvdrs...."
,13000432,2012-09-02T12:38Z,"@abernick00

thanks for the information.  wow, one to four weeks.  that's a lot of lead time.  and just out of curiousity, what is the largest entertainment distributor?  thanks again."
,luckboots,2012-09-05T23:23Z,"Felt the need to post for the first time ever...nowandnever, fyi if you are streaming, or coppied it to ps3, chances are the ""cinavia"" protection went on, and the video kept going and audio shut off. This happens with ps3's after an update a year or so ago. use PS media server it works awesome and also has transcoding built into it which allows for transfering of video to ps3 without the cinavia protection kicking in. If it is a DVD your using then abernick is right. There may not be CP on the mp4 as you state but the ps3's cinavia software looks for mismatched audio/video files and flags it as pirated generally letting video run and audio stop. just my 2 cents as i use my ps3 for the same purpose.
