Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday July 25th edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex airs an interview he recorded this past weekend with American virtuoso guitarist and legendary lead vocalist for the almost three-decade strong, highly influential thrash-metal band Megadeth, Dave Mustaine. 

Alex also talks with author and investigative journalist, Dave Krieger, in-studio. Mr. Krieger is the author of Clouded Titles, a book that exposes the mortgage scandal created by banker endorsed deregulation.

Alex also covers the latest news, including the backlash following New York mayor Micheal Bloomberg's call for cops to walk out in protest of firearm rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment.
