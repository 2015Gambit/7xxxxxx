Page 44 is missing and page 45 appears twice, making the page count ""accurate"" overall. I leafed through the whole file hoping to find page 44 misplaced somewhere or at the end of the file but couldn't. I will _try_ to find a print copy of the text, make a scan of the missing page and re-upload. If someone reading this message can beat me at this (or already has the ebook or access to contents via the WHFreeman website and is willing to extract and share page 44), please do.
