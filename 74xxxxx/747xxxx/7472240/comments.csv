During the first two seasons, contestants would compete in challenges each day to add money into the pot. However, one of the contestants is ""The Mole"", one who's job is to prevent the team from adding money to the pot by playing sabotage in each challenge. At the end of each day, the contestants will take a quiz to see how much they know about The Mole. The quiz questions are based on the Mole's performance on that particular day. The one who scores the lowest will be eliminated from the game. The one who figures out who The Mole is will have the best chance in taking home the pot.

During seasons #3 & #4, the object of the game remained the same, but with an all celebrity casts and a celebrity mole.
