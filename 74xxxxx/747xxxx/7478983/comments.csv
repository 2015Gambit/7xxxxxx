,gamester2,2012-07-28T04:23Z,"ur welcome, yea it does work i was playing it i have it burned, and popped it right in the pc made an exact img with img burn, and passed it on to you"
,Randompersonguy,2012-07-29T05:00Z,"now we just need a working dvd5 version of Pandora's Tower, and all three of the ""big three"" Wii RPGs will be available "
,gamester2,2012-07-29T07:09Z,"make sure you all seed this please, yea i know i did this for the guy who did the last story and he did that for me, i heard pandoras tower sux, watched a vid though and it seems awesome"
,gamester2,2012-07-29T10:33Z,"randompersonguy, i have a dvd5 of pandora if you didnt get one yet"
,flag4star,2012-07-29T18:57Z,i wish this worked but it didnt. got the 1165 error
,gamester2,2012-07-29T21:40Z,"then you did something wrong, idk what you did but this is an exact disc imge, its not for loaders, i play everyday"
,gamester2,2012-07-29T21:42Z,"it is a pal copy so if your wii doesnt play pal idk what to tell you, fully works on ntsc 4.3u wii ios 249"
,flag4star,2012-07-29T22:41Z,oh i see. I didnt know it was a pal copy. i will retry
,Felix-Cat,2012-07-30T02:38Z,"I have a hard modded NTSC-U Wii, I tried many versions of this game and non of them worked for me. I need a NTSC DVD5 copy of this :( "
,gamester2,2012-07-30T04:43Z,"sorry to all who cant play pal, pal is just the tvt though, i have ntsc-u but i cAn play pal and i have an old tv, try loading it through disc channel thats what i do, i mean its a perfect copy, or neogamma and forcing ntsc, donno about hard mods at all, but from what i hear there unesscessary and suck"
,gamester2,2012-07-30T04:44Z,is this even made in ntsc?
,Felix-Cat,2012-07-30T19:53Z,"Yes, there is a NTSC-U  version of this for north america, but it's a dual layer copy."
,Felix-Cat,2012-07-30T19:55Z,"Yes, there is a NTSC-U  version of this for north america, but it's a dual layer copy. And I have a release Wii when it first came out. The problem is that early release Wiis have a faulty laser and can't read dual layer disks."
,gamester2,2012-07-31T00:55Z,"well the point of this torrent is single layer, thats what dvd5 5 means, i have ntsc and it works fine, shame you cant play pal, why 4.3u can and you cant is a mystery, but i'll never post a dual layer torrent, its hit or miss with that shit, i made a last story dual layer copy and it never worked, i followed the dd5 instructions and it didnt work, sometimes if you want it done right you do it yourself, this here is my copy done right for my 4.3u wii, i would like to share it with whoever can use it, sorry your having so much trouble with you wii mod, "
,gamester2,2012-08-01T00:48Z,if you all need me to re seed let me know
,Felix-Cat,2012-08-01T22:33Z,"@gamester2 if you had read my comment you would have known that I'm not asking you to upload a dual layer copy because like I said in my comment my Wii can't read dual layer disks.
And the reason that this works on your Wii and not mine is because you have a softmodded Wii, mine is hard modded.
Anyway, I just want to know how to rip a game and shrink it's size because I already have the dual layer NTSC-U copy of Xenoblade and I want to rip it myself. "
,gamester2,2012-08-02T18:29Z,"no i read that, wich is why i said i dont make dual layer torrents, not everyone can use them"
,gamester2,2012-08-02T18:35Z,"and yes i get that the reason is your hard modded, but why wont a hard mod play certain discs...thats a mystery to me, i'm sure it has something to do with the firmware and compatability issues, i guess since 90 percent of us have a free softmod wich seems like the all around better mod you hard mods get screwed, i never saw the value in ""chipping"" on any system"
,Felix-Cat,2012-08-02T23:30Z,"@gamester2 Well, since you only have a soft modded Wii, you don't know the benefits of having a hard modded one!
My cousin has a soft modded Wii, and he has to continously keep updating CIOS', firmwares, softwares and all sort of programmes just to get a game running. And FYI, I have never had trouble with any game before except for this one because it came on a dual layer disk."
,flag4star,2012-08-11T22:18Z,"hey, i was new to this when i commented before. im sure your download works, it was me who was burning games wrong. now that I know how to, i really want to play this game. can someone seed it? it wont download"
,gamester2,2012-08-20T02:58Z,"always some idiot who doesnt know how to burn discs or play burnt games giving bad reviews of files that work perfect, not to mention ive uploaded this in iso so no extracting bs, this torrent works fn perfect!!!!! from the very start, how someone could fuck up burning 1 iso to 1 disc with no other steps fucking baffles me, open img burn, select iso to disc add file and click burn, maybe i need to include img burn tutorials so the noobs can stop fucking up my rep"
