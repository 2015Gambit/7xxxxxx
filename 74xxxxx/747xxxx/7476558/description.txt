SUMMARY:

The Punk Syndrome is a film about Finland's most kick-ass punk
rock band, Pertti Kurikan Nimipivt. The band members, Pertti,
Kari, Toni and Sami, are mentally handicapped and they play their
music with a lot of attitude and pride.

We follow these professional musicians on their journey from
obscurity to popularity. We watch them fight, fall in love and
experience strong emotions. We witness long days in the recording
studio and on tour. They laugh, cry, drink and fight over who gets
to sit in the front on the tour bus. Then it's time to make up and
go talk to people in the audience and tell them how great their
band is.

Their songs are about the problems in society as well as about
things that they face in their everyday life: how going to the
pedicurist sucks and the misery of living in a group home. The
guys give piece of their mind to both politicians and people
whose attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities
need improvement.

The Punk Syndrome is a film about the essence of punk. Its a
story of handicapped people rebelling against the mainstream.
This time you're allowed to stare and wonder why they act the way
they do. And you'll fall in love with them as you watch how the
most kick-ass punk band in Finland conquers the world.
