,DOHC-6,2012-07-24T17:02Z,As of yet there are many Peers trying to dl this file but there are no seeders present.
,DOHC-6,2012-07-25T18:06Z,"I stopped dling this file when Medainfo displayed the audio as being altered from the original AC3 6ch to lesser quality AAC 2ch (160), and the video had been altered from the original High profile 4.1 264 to baseline MP4 via Handbrake. 
Why would anyone do that?"
,yroger,2012-07-28T03:56Z,encoding changed via handbrake to reduce file size and enable streaming through my mediacenter and roku
,CmdrData7,2012-07-29T17:49Z,2 CH audio?  Reduced video quality?  MP4 format?  I'll wait for Footy to upload 6ch MKV...
