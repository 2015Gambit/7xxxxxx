,peterhoover,2012-07-24T19:11Z,WE NEED SEEDERS....SEEDERS PEOPLE.  QUIT DOING A HIT AND RUN.
,DEF4CT0,2012-07-24T19:18Z,"FINALLY, NOT A FAKE!!!"
,Neraforesta,2012-07-24T19:34Z,"The sample would suggest A/V 5/5 ...for a cam. Not incredibly good, but I suppose its watchable..ehh. Now, the DL speed is another thing all together.  I truly hope people are seeding. If you aren't seeding, at least until you've finished watching the movie, well then, you are just a bad person all together, and probably won't live past 45..lol on you."
,thefluxx,2012-07-24T20:00Z,seed.seed.seed please.
,Elq1,2012-07-24T20:29Z,"Am seeding,  "
,squirrelbob2,2012-07-24T20:38Z,I'd say V/5 A/5 and relatively low chance of getting shot. Another good reason on the side of CAMs.
,suckonthis1,2012-07-24T21:11Z,"THANKS FOR UPLOAD.. SEEDING ALLDAY

,Neraforesta,2012-07-24T22:05Z,The sample is 5/5. The file is 3/2. Not worth it gang. Too blurry.
,nvasanka,2012-07-25T02:03Z,"@Neraforesta
totally agree.

Movie itself was one of the greatest pieces of cinema I have ever seen.
I saw it on seehd.seoneter.com because it has better quality then this torrent and it worked for my PS3 as well. Best Batman ever!! "
,magmaz,2012-07-25T02:11Z,SEEEEEEEEEED!!!! been dying to watch this an with 20mb line I only get 30kb/s

,andrewa14,2012-07-25T06:28Z,"@blah546,
You are a good little troll. Do you get paid for it? If you recall from ""The Dark Knight"", the Joker told the mobsters you should ""never do anything you're good at for free."" So I just wanted to make sure you knew that being a piece of panty waste could pay off in the end, just don't spread your ass pussy for free anymore. Get to the corner and work that tight little shit pussy...

As for film, best so far but the audio is heavy on bass. Give it a try...

Thnx uploader"
,viejogab,2012-07-25T10:18Z,"holy shit this is the best action movie of the year, nice torrent thanks heromaster, movie 10/10 seed!"

... is probably the most watchable, because of the audio."
,omglolpenguin,2012-07-26T04:58Z,"Saw this in the theater. . . . I was the only one of my friends who knew the agent at the beginning (the man on the left in the second screenshot) was Petyr Baelish from Game of Thrones.

I'd comment on the video but it's still downloading at 300kb/s. XD"
