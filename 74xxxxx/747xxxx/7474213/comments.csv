,crotchfist,2012-07-26T02:50Z,"niiice, glad someone had this already.
i'll be sure to listen to this once downloaded."
,kjdaflip,2012-07-26T04:25Z,"Wow, so much for helping with #OperationDethrone -_-. I came here because i didnt believe someone already put it on piratebay"
,MoosaNYC,2012-07-26T07:07Z,"Please support the artist, I agree free music is better music but when it comes to Monstercat I ALWAYS pay. There is 60 S and 30 L in total ~90 x $10. Thats $900 lost for your favorite artist! Come on guys support #OperationDethrone!"
,eShaYz1,2012-07-26T12:26Z,look i'd love to support these artists but im 14 and don't have the money
,AlienPDX,2012-07-27T02:40Z,I intend to buy it. But for now until I get my paycheck...I love monstercat.
,AzzaXe,2012-07-27T13:58Z,"I refuse to pay $17 for this album. I would be okay if it were $9.99 like in the US store, but fuck off, my country's dollar is valued higher than the US at the moment too. Buying it may go to a good cause yes, but I'm not fucking paying $17 dollars for a digital album."
,atndigcrk,2012-07-27T14:35Z,its actually at over 5000 downloads lol 
,imacusami2,2012-07-27T16:38Z,I would also love to support #OperationDethrone but im 14 years old and dont have the money to buy it.
,rbtrary1,2012-07-28T02:41Z,"I've already bought this on iTunes but Track 5 was DRM'ed and I can't stand when different songs have different bit rates. So, here I am. I'm hoping you bought this from Amazon?"
,Whozha,2012-08-05T01:16Z,is this only dubstep? (i dont like it) or is it like dnb and other stuff too?
,atndigcrk,2012-08-05T19:58Z,Dubstep / Electro / House / Drum and Bass / Drumstep / Hard Dance / Trance
,BROWNY09,2012-09-06T14:18Z,"@Whozha It's not only Dubstep it's a mix of Dubstep, DnB, Electro, EDM. Stuff like that, it is really worth buying actually. I have"
