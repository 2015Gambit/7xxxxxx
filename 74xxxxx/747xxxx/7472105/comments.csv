All show as 2:36:41 in vlc, although I haven't watched them.
The bottom two, are the best of the five.

,You_Muppet,2012-07-28T14:50Z,"With a nod to @Silencer7, I also downloaded 5 versions of this torrent and here are my scores: 

A-5, V-5, 1.86GB - RESISTANCE uploaded by S4A
A-5, V-5, 2.17GB - FUTiLE uploaded by TvTeam
A-5, V-6, 2.17GB - INSPiRAL uploaded by S4A
A-6, V-6, 1.94GB - UNiQUE uploaded by Mantesh
A-7, V-6, 1.87GB - TS Xvid 26K uploaded by Froggie

For me, the last print is the most watchable because of the audio. (This 26K is a different version to the one @Silencer7 reviewed)."
