Show Description:
The Next Star is a Canadian reality television show on YTV hosted by Adamo Ruggiero. The show is a competition to find the most talented singer in Canada who is under 15 years of age. 

Adamo Ruggiero returned as the host for season 5, with Keshia Chante, Mark Spicoluk, and Tara Oram as new judges. The season premiered on July 16, 2012. There are also new segments and a new wild card. The wild card is that at the end of all the auditions 1 person who didn't get chosen at first will be chosen then. That will make a top 13.




Capper note:
I'm uploading S05E01 just a test to see if there's any interest in the show.  I'm not really a fan of these talent reality shows (singing or otherwise)... but I'll keep doing the show if there's a good amount of interest.  
This is basically like those "Idol" shows.. but for kids.
