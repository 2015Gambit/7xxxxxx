Description:
Meet Jack Slate, a cop whoΓÇÖs having a bad day. Framed for murder and facing execution, he makes a daring escape from the Iron Point Maximum-Security Penitentiary. Driven to bring the criminal element that framed him to justice, Slate hunts the hunters in this gritty, crime-noir inspired epic. He finds himself alone and on the run trying to survive the hard streets of Grant City. Without a home and pitifully few friends, what Jack discovers sends him on a downward spiral into a labyrinth of corruption, betrayal and crime.

! Note
There is a bug which will prevent you from finishing the first chapter (tutorial). The developers of the game have released a patch to fix the issue, but it doesn't work with the provided crack. You'll have to enter a cheat code which unlocks all the chapters and skip to the second chapter. At the main menu, hold down C and press the following keys: SASWS. If done correctly, the words "LAZY-ASS MODE" will appear on-screen under the game title. You can now go into the Chapters submenu and start any chapter you want.
