,LePatay,2012-07-24T15:14Z,Thank you. Did it take long to do it? Any info about a crack?
,thetacticalfart,2012-07-24T15:17Z,"When do you think the  cracks will be available?
"
,almostD,2012-07-24T15:20Z,"I just downloaded them, somebody has downloaded the alternative files from VideoCopilot and put on the net. I just extracted and made torrent.

Download what you need. Use them with other programs or with official license of Element 3D.

No Element 3d or package crack yet."
,almostD,2012-07-24T15:27Z,"Somebody on the net is working on it, but rumors say it's very hard to crack it, maybe two months or so. Probably they'll wait for some updates. I think scene setup crack has already been patched in the 1.0.322 version of the plugin. The release plugin was 1.0.320.
They are working on adding animated Obj and real time Shadows. I think it's worth it.
I personally bought Element 3D with a 15% discount on TubeTape.net. Sale is over now but maybe you find other offers elsewhere.

I wanted to have the latest release, Andrew is still working hard on this plugin, If a crack is released it's not automatic that it will let you update. That's why I choosed to buy it (I will not pay for packages, will use the ones I uploaded here and other models I find on the net).

Regards to all

,Petonii,2012-07-24T15:48Z,Shit nvm. Yeah i am buying the program but i get my tax return in 2 weeks and i am in love with this program so i can't wait lol

,almostD,2012-07-24T16:57Z,"I had problem with the bank transfer, I had to wait one week after I bought Element before putting my hands on the license and use it.

I understand it's hard to waiting for this plugin.

,JOB1999,2012-07-24T22:42Z,"  I purchased the Element 3D plugin, and it is pretty awesome.  I downloaded the packs from here, but the too need license codes.
  Does anyone know how to extract the models and shaders from the packs so they can be used?..or when cracks for these packs will be available?"
,almostD,2012-07-25T00:59Z,"JOB1999 I don't get it, how come you need license for this? You can use those models even in cinema 4d, maya, max, blender etc.

extract the pack you want, copy the folder to 

username/documents/videocopilot/models/


When you open element they should be there. Otherwise, click on import object file and open the file you want from the folder. Then import the materials (diffusion, specular normal and if you find it the occlusion maps).

I'm using everything and it works fine. You just need to set the map for every obj.

Forget about FBX files. Those are for Maya.

If you have installed other package, just move the .epacks to another folder, so you have them ready for the crack (hopefully).

Hope you succeed
AlmostD"
,sebast123,2012-07-25T04:04Z,im stuck at 49.6 please seed
,JOB1999,2012-07-25T04:58Z,"Thanks AlmostD.  I had downloaded the other files previous to this one.  I installed the loaders, but the say I need to register them and enter a license in the Stage Setup.  I will give this one a try, and do as you suggested.  I do use Maya, so the FBX are needed.
Thanks again."
,sebast123,2012-07-25T05:13Z,can you please upload again the torrent always stops at 49.6 for almost everyone who is downloading it 
,JOB1999,2012-07-25T08:56Z,"Hey AlmostD
  Thanks again for telling me about this torrent and the epacks.  Everything seems good...just waiting for seeders.  I've been hovering around 50% for a few hours.
  Any news about a working Pro Shaders download?  The one on here is an epack that needs a license.
Thanks again for your help."
,almostD,2012-07-25T13:12Z,"Here I am again, sorry for not seeding to much, my uploading is not so fast.

People doesn't stay in seed that's why I have to seed it all by myself.

Now I'm seeding full up band. Several hours and you'll be ok.

Regards
AlmostD"
,almostD,2012-07-25T13:22Z,"About Pro Shaders, I already uploaded all the materials, you just have to recreate them inside element one at the time. Ex:

use plain, soft or shiny base material, duplicate and replace it, double clic on the name and you rename it (concrete, rock, etc). Go down and find diffusion map etc. Clic and select the diffusion map. Do the same for specular, normal and occlusion map if you find them in the materials. Normal can go up more than 100%. When you are happy with the result, save it as a preset. Element will ask you where it should be saved. clic on the right folder of the uncracked package folder (the one asking you for the license when you clic it), choose the right folder (concrete, rock etc). Element will create a new folder tree with the same hierarchy of the Pro Shaders one. Clic ok. 

Now do it for all the shaders. :-)

I know they are not perfect (every material has his settings) but it's a great starting base until somebody posts a crack.

Have fun"

,almostD,2012-07-28T13:18Z,"When a crack will be released, me or somebody else will rush here to share it. Stop asking for something that doesn't exist yet and wait as everybody is doing (the wait could be months long).

,andrew2789,2012-07-28T21:29Z,So is there anyway to get the regular maps for all these files? The only ones i see in the extract are the alternates. They all come up white and textureless for me. Thx!
,Petonii,2012-07-29T03:10Z,"almostD, is there a pro shaders version of these where it is not an installer? "
,jmason17,2012-07-29T11:55Z,"Hey almostD,
I have the same problem as andrew2789.
every object i open has all the right texture names and everything. but they are all white!
i don't have a clue how to get the textures to just load on to the objects automatically.
any answer?"
,almostD,2012-07-29T16:36Z,"I'm working on some files you can copy to enable automatically the shaders. I had actually to import manually this shaders and save the materials. It's a long thing.

This torrent doesn't have installers, just files. If you need original maps, you can download the installers (the ones already uploaded on pirate bay) and extract them with 7zip. I did so and merged the folders. I will not do a new torrent, this staff is already uploaded.

Right after i clic ""Submit"" I'will create a new torrent with EMF files, so your shaders will be ok.

can u help me out in installing this stuff...i opened this 3d elements in AE cs5 using the element plugin but the problem is that the default textures are not getting loaded..the models are seen in white..or should we add these textures manually??? any idea on this problem plssss"
,thomas322,2012-08-24T14:56Z,and in which folder should we add these models?? plss do reply sir
,skoxpress,2012-08-27T06:54Z,"You don't really need the license.

Find your ""Models"" file. Mine was D/users/myname/My Documents/VideoCopilot/
and load the files there.
The models show up in the ""Model Browser"" and from the ""Edit"" column double click on ""none set"" and get the material by clicking down arrow and ""Load from File.."" Then go to the map file of the model you're loading."
,polezo,2012-08-29T22:28Z,"Where is the ambient occlusion?  I downloaded the packs separately and extracted the materials from the installers, but they only seem to have, diffuse, specular, and normal.  Where can I find the ambient occlusion materials?"
