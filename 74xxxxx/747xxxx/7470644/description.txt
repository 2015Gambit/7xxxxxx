Full Element Model Pack. All 6 alternative download.

Files in Obj (quads), Obj (triangles), Fbx (Maya) and alternate materials.


Packages are downloadable separately, so if you already have other packages you don't have to download the whole torrent.


If you have package installers, the file you can extract (materials) have ambient occlusion. The materials you find in the alternate materials have no ambient occlusion.

I mixed those packages with original ones so I have all materials. I don't have time to repack all, just download what you want and put the files in:

username/my documents/videocopilot/models/


Have fun
