Toï Doï is Gilles Coïa, a funny warrior coming from Paris' suburbs. Sound perfectionist, with classical and jazz music education background, he became a music maker addicted... His studio, furnished with crazy engines and dreaming machines. His music takes its roots in the hardcore and trance underground scene (in the 90's) and his sound has been going around the world for a while.From Montreal to Tokyo or Berlin, his acid and cerebral compositions keep on feeding the electronic scene. After "conspirations" with the Micro-Points and Extravertif experimental projects (Rex Club 1995), he met Goa Gil, mythical designer of parties among the most famous in Goa. Toï Doï music became part of the master track list @ Love Parade 96 and many creations in the following years... After a periode of silence, Toï Doï is now back with his newest album, released with Dimensional Records!
