Driving cross-country to a job interview, Colin takes a short cut and comes across a fatal
road accident. One of the drivers, Jina, is shaken but unhurt; the other has been killed instantly.
Beside the dead body is a briefcase full of money, which Colin turns in to the local police.
But getting out of town proves a nightmare, as Colin's good deed causes a series of bizarre events to unfold.
