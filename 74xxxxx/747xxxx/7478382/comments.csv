,BarrySoetoro,2012-07-27T03:58Z,"Hmm, everyone's stuck at 68.6%"
,minniesucks,2012-07-27T05:29Z,Wow. What asshats to grab it and run.
,BarrySoetoro,2012-07-27T05:39Z,"I don't think anyone got to 100%, minniesucks. Everyone generally seeds for at least a day. 

I'm always one of the first peers, and observe the whole seeding process. This time, hayesy (the only peer at 100%) disappeared before anyone could get past 68.6%.

Probably a connection issue... went to bed and their PC had a scheduled event or something."
,hayesy316,2012-07-27T13:06Z,"Sorry, seeding again. Was out all day and seeded for as long as I could this morning. uTorrent told me there was a couple of complete sources, but I guess that wasn't the case."
,BarrySoetoro,2012-07-28T00:06Z,No problem... thanks!
