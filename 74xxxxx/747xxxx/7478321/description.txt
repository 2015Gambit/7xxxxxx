OVER 40 Jump & Jive Classics from the Swing Era..

Contrary to Popular belief the history of the Music Promotional Video did not begin with Abba or Queen in the mid 1970's, but way way back in the dark days of 1941 in the USA where the first Video Juke Boxes were being introduced.

These early video Juke Boxes were very expensive and were stocked with Soundie films as they were called.   As the latest machine "The Panoram" were rolled out it looked for a while that the video media was going to be the next 'big thing' and performers and bandleaders with sufficient financial backing invested in the new medium to make sure there 'Soundie' Video could be fitted into these early machines.

It is that we have to thank for this collection of priceless rarities you see listed below.   The quality considering the age is remarkable.  All are black and White and needless to say not in wide screen..

Quality as original DVD (MPEG2) but the VOB's are split into tracks and tagged using industry standard notation.   Fast download from a Seedbox on the Internet Fibre Optic backbone.
