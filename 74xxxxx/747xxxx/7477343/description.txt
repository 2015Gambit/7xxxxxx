these books are available on torrent sites already, but a problem I've noticed is that in uploading ~4GB of content at once, unless its already perfectly organized (multiple formats, consistent naming technique, etc) it makes it difficult for the downloader to sort through the material and find what they want to read quickly.

I uploaded this because i consider these to be great contemporary books.  I want others to read them and recommend other books I may also enjoy (amazon can only do so much)

I'm especially interested in adding some economic literature to this list.

Thanks!
