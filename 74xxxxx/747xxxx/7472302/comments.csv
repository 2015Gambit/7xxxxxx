,yessence,2012-09-06T00:09Z,"if these works, I seriously love you :D "
,yessence,2012-09-07T10:36Z,"Okay, a few of the files have downloaded completely, and yes. Use MPC to play these files, at least if you want the japanese audio with subs. It doesn't even work properly in the KMPlayer. Only the english audio works with other players. It's slightly annoying having to download a new media player for one series only, but at least this one doesn't take a lot of space.

I downloaded MPC from here: http://www.free-codecs.com/Media_Player_Classic_download.htm the only other place I found MPC it was downloadable only in french it seemed."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-08T00:35Z,"yessense, Download K-liteCodecs from their official Site, you can also play these files with Latest VLC player. It does not work on any other player because they dont support 10bit yet."
,yessence,2012-09-10T21:36Z,"Actually, now that I've downloaded it in full, it actually works just fine on the KMPlayer even when you change audio and subtitles, no need to download any codecs or anything. It's kind of strange that it wouldn't work before, but hey, I'm not complaining xD"
,s1aa,2012-09-11T00:46Z,Could you please seed whoever still has it? I don't want to wait days D:
