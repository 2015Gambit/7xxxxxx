Welfare research has established a range of scientific indicators of stress, welfare and suffering in animals that can be applied to all aspects of improving their welfare through good housing and management, and the topic continues to grow in importance among both professionals and the public.The practical focus of this authoritative, comprehensive encyclopedia aims to promote the understanding and improvement of animals behaviour without compromising welfare.
