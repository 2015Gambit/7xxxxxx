I didn't find the iFly 737 for FSX here at TPB so I decided to upload a torrent.

Important Note: This is an add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX). You must have installed FSX in order to make this add-on work!

This add-on is not compatible with Mac OSX or Linux since FSX runs only on Windows.

Install:

1. un-zip (I recommend 7Zip), password is: gulli

2. install the iFly 737 by running ifly-737-FSX.exe

3. copy the contents of the folder 'Gauges' into the folder 'Gauges' in your FSX folder, click 'overwrite', when prompted

4. start FSX, it will ask you if you want to run the iFly Modules, click yes

5. Fly! 

Tips:

If you're not familiar with Boeing 737 aircraft systems you might have difficulties to fly it, because this aircraft is highly detailed and the systems are very complex. I recommend you to take a look into the manuals located also in the start menu (manual is in english only)

Take your time for configuring the 737 using the configuration manager located in the start menu.

If you have any trouble e.g. crash to desktop, try running FSX in admin mode (right click on fsx, 'run as admin' vista and win7 only) and make sure you have both service packs or Acceleration Pack for FSX installed.

Download a fresh Airac Cycle to avoid annoying FMC messages 'waypoint not found' when entering the route.

Try the two online networks IVAO and VATSIM, they are networks for online flying as realistic as possible! http://ivao.aero http://vatsim.net

My upload bandwidth is limited to 100 kb/s, so please seed to make high speed downloads possible! ;-)

greetings from another Flight Simulator pilot who loves the iFly 737 :-)
