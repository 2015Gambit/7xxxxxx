,pumpernickel,2012-07-27T11:20Z,"It appears, that this is exactly the same iFly ""737NGX 1.0 Cracked by Tmoos"" version as uploaded here about May 2011."
,hdRageSc2,2012-07-27T15:03Z,"@kingashi: I don't know, but if I load the 737, I don't have any frames-per-second loss."

Req.: MilViz Beechcraft Baron B-55!!!"
,captray,2012-07-28T03:14Z,"Thanks a lot!!!
Suggestions: FSUIPC v4.84 (too much expensive, Mr. Dowson!) and Milviz B55."
,Manhole45,2012-07-28T06:50Z,I agree about FSUIPC.  There is no reason a dll file should cost that much.
,hdRageSc2,2012-07-28T16:13Z,"For FSUIPC 4.84: Download it at schiratti.com/downson and try to unlock it with a key of a previous version, sometimes, it works."
,captray,2012-07-28T17:58Z,hdRageSc2: that didn't work for me; Did it for you?
,hdRageSc2,2012-07-28T18:30Z,"Didn't test it, however in FS2004 it works."
,captray,2012-07-28T19:57Z,"hdRageSc2: what actually happens is that when you're installing and you insert the key, it momentarily says ""ok""; but then you enter FSX > Modules > FSUIPC (in order to set it up) and it finally tells you it's an unregistered (and limited) copy of it..."
,andy20095,2012-07-29T09:03Z,"Well it works fine but,the737-600-700-900- version does not  have gauges.But the 737-800 works fantastic I wonder can you fix that It will be great

,hdRageSc2,2012-07-29T18:58Z,"You can give the 737-600, 737-700 etc. the 737-800 panel by deleting the content of the panel.cfg located in FS-FolderSim ObjectsAirplanesifly 737-x00panel.xxx and inserting

[FLTSIM]
alias=iFly 737-800panel.xxx

xxx have to be replaced. This is only for the 2D Panel."

Perhaps yours, with the extra 6/10 megabyte, will escape the issues plaguing ""your"" other torrent."
,captray,2012-07-30T13:26Z,"Guys, search for an article titled ""FSUIPC a milk cow?"" - someone please crack that damn thing!"
,mroschk,2012-07-30T13:48Z,"Hello,

,coastie13,2012-07-31T16:14Z,Thanks! everything works great for me
,Espana25,2012-08-01T01:14Z,Which ones better? PMDG or this one just need an opinion been flying PMDG NGX from quite long very familiar with that aircraft ...is this similar to that one or something less ?
,Taco92,2012-08-01T09:57Z,Thanks...
,hdRageSc2,2012-08-01T14:40Z,"I think, the iFly will give you more fps than PMDG, but the aircraft systems are almost the same. There's no big difference between iFly and PMDG 737."
,Juan86270,2012-08-01T21:31Z,alguien tiene el Update para fsx. 
,Chugalugg,2012-08-11T23:51Z,"hdRageSc2, the systems are the same as PMDG? Your a moron if you think that shitty Chinese 737 is anywhere near the software of PMDG.............."
,usaf0910,2012-09-02T14:50Z,"I am having Trouble with extracting the file. I use 7-zip and it gave me an error that says ""Data error in encrypted file""iFly737FSX.exe"" Wrong Passsword"" And i checked that i put the right password. Can someone help ? Thanks !!!"
