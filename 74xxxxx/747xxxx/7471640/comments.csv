Guess I have no choice but to d/l individuals.
Nomad who the fuck cares who repacked?
But most are picky on source/quality.
HDTV/DVDRip...

Have no choice but to ASSume:
poor SDTV and poor COMMskip

And tom how the fuck is this a PROPER release?"
,go.scrw.urslf,2012-09-15T07:49Z,"@offsprung... Dude, your bitching about free shit. these are repacked because other people were having problems with the other torrents. I being one of the people. someone took their time to go through the other torrents and provide you with uncropped, non-skipping/freezing video files so you can enjoy watching them. so stop bitchin and enjoy and say thank you!

@toki.... download cccp or k-lite codec pack. or just download VLC media player which already has most codecs. "
