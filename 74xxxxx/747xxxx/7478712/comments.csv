,ld480,2012-07-27T04:51Z,"Instead of another x.264 could we get an XviD release (please, I'm saying please :)"
,Mattmjn,2012-07-27T08:06Z,thx for the good work.  and ya x264 < xvid
,HI_Sa1nt,2012-07-27T08:57Z,Intense episode. +1
,dee60,2012-07-27T14:18Z,Thanks for sharing.
,slurpinsmegma,2012-08-05T08:05Z,"Well, i dont want to speak for vtv, but i doubt you will see an xvid release unless V uses a different source. The source is FQM, who is part of the group of releasers that adopted the SD x264 TV Releasing Standards of 2012.
Some other sources who have adopted this new method are LOL, ASAP, MOMENTUM, SYS, TLA, LMAO, C4TV, DiVERGE, etc.
Bottom line is x264 offers a smaller file size with higher quality. No reason not to like. 
Thanks VTV, and feel free to put me in my place if i am out of line :D"
