Long time no see.

My Player Database for FM12,the latest Moskollo DB is updated to include transfers upto and including 25/7/12, to Carzola's move to Arsenal.

I have done as many transfers as I can, will see for as long as possible, please try to back me up.

Put the moskollo DB files into your 'my documents/sports interactive/football manager 2012/editor data folder and then when starting a new game select moskollo db.

For the backgrounds pack, put this into your graphics folder. I can't lay claim to all images, but I have a thing for pictures of the team's best moments for backgrounds so those are generally me.

Positive comments will be cool as well.

I'm based in Tokyo, from October, downloading will be worth two years in prison here. Fight SOPA in all it's forms, the music and film industries are trying to fight back-don't let them win people they've got enough cash even with downloading..

Peace and God bless,




Moskollo
