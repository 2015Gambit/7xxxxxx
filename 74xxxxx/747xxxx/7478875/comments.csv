,elangton2000,2012-07-27T07:21Z,"a/v? I watched the sample on my pc and it looked better than what's out there, but on my ps3 looked less than appealing so I am hesitant to download the actual movie and share as I don't have unlimited bandwidth."

Not going to rate the video and sound by numbers as those don't mean anything. 

Cleaner than any other one I've seen. I looked at the actual movie. It's not as blurry as the other ones, someone worked hard on making it watchable. The sound has a lot of bass and the music seems to be missing an entire range of sound, but the speech is clear. I am still going to wait for an R5 or whatever Rnumber someone chooses to call it, but this is much better than the others before it (I've looked at several)."
,giggedyguy,2012-07-27T08:20Z,"Forgot to mention, it suffers from too much darkness. Blurriness is mild in the beginning but some parts I sampled seem to be even more blurry.  Only reason I decided to wait for a better copy."
,machspee,2012-07-27T18:18Z,"^^Dude, the reason people rate by numbers because most people don't care to read a paragraph explaining how the quality of the torrent is."
,machspee,2012-07-27T18:20Z,"Holy shit! hahahaaha, nicely trolled uploader!

In all seriousness, why did you select this specific scene out of all the scenes in the movie?

I mean,this scene is the twist in the movie that makes it absolutely terrifying and important in the climax part. Don't you have the common sense that most of the people will download the sample first before downloading the movie? This is really a lame ""fuck you"" you are saying metaphorically to all of your downloaders.

I don't have to worry because I already watched the movie in theater(Thank God) I only downloaded the sample in this torrent to see what scene it is. 

Anyway based on the sample,

A= 2
V= -10
