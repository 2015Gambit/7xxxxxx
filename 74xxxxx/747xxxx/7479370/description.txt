I have included the original flash animations and have also ripped them to .mp4's.

To view the flash, right click on .swf file --> open with --> IE (Internet Explorer). You may then need to allow IE to run ActiveX controls. Or you can just watch the .mp4's, though the flash looks better.

Princess is a Flash animation series by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of South Park. The story follows a Lhasa Apso dog.
 
On December 8, 1999, Daily Variety reported that Parker and Stone were going to produce 39 shorts that were to be 3-5 minutes long. In January 2000, the duo announced that they would have full creative and artistic control of the series.
 
The animated short was originally produced with Macromedia Flash in 2001 and was meant to be showcased on Macromedia's sister-site shockwave. Stone and Parker never heard back from shockwave after submitting the first two episodes.

At the end of the "Officer Friendly" episode, the viewers are invited to see the next installment, "Princess Finds A Red Balloon". However, according to South Park Studios, the episode was never produced following the rejection of the first two.
 
Parker has stated that he and Stone would love to do more episodes if someone wanted to distribute them and has encouraged fans with Flash skills to continue the story themselves.
