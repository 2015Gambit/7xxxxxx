,skoxpress,2012-08-20T16:20Z,"Very odd. It seems to install everything BUT 3DS Max 2013. No desk icon, no .exe, no license window. Not in Programs to uninstall.

Wow is this fucked up. Good luck to anybody new to this. After you find and create a shortcut to the .exe you have to try to get the key code in. The kengen keeps disappearing. 
  I finally got it, but really it was accidental."
,bloodair,2012-08-25T13:09Z,Everything went smooth. Installer extracted files then the installation process started after few minutes everything was installed. Double clicked the 3ds max shortcut from my desktop program started then activation following the instructions from the crack folder and everything works fine.

,jackangel,2012-09-12T23:16Z,"First time I installed it went smooth, worked perfectly, could use it with no problem at all. But now I'm having some troubles to install on another pc and i don't know what's causing it, thought maybe you could have an idea on how to fix it: I blocked internet conection and ran the keygen normally just like before, and then it sucessfully activates, but instead of running the program it starts an activation loop, it asks again the code saying its license 2.10.0, and then when I put the code from the keygen again it goes sucessful again, but calls back another activation screen with license 1.1.0, and it goes on and on. I've reinstalled it over 5 times, cleaned the files from register, blocked server through host and still same."
