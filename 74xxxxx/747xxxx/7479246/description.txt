NOTES:
	
This version of game is 1.0.3.7  ,playable Online on Private (Cracked) servers or Single Player (Solo).
On "Multiplayer" menu  you'll   find on Favorites Tab up to 46 servers 
added by me manually .
Just click on "Refresh List" and choose server to play online.
Feel free to add more servers or delete some servers from favorites.

On this version of game you cannot change name from console !!! 
In KillingFloor folder ,open rev.ini with notepad ,find line "PlayerName=nosteam.ro" and change nosteam.ro with your name !!!!


Perks = working *(read note below)
Achievements = working *(read note below)

*NOTE ABOUT PERKS - ACHIEVEMENTS:
You must play solo first to make some Perks and Achievements to play online with them because you cannot acquire nothing online if you are not a Legit Player but you can use perks on multiplayer servers.
