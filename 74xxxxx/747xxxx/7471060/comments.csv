I recommend you get the original 26K version (2.2GB)"

SEED!!!!
pa I saw it in the movies already so there. "
,WA2Z,2012-07-25T06:39Z,Is there a better one... the video is okay but the audio is not.
,RTT2,2012-07-25T09:17Z,"""Very crappy conversion relative to the original""

I doubt that. If the resolution isn't there to begin with, there's no point having huge sizes, you might as well have the transcode. Some cams can be good, but generally the res isn't good, whatever the filesize. It's like HD scanning an old photocopy. Even 4-500MB x264 dvdrips look better than both CAMs and TSs. 

""I recommend you get the original 26K version (2.2GB)""

I recommend you wait for the TS, than get a convert. It's not worth the Gbs.

Thanks for the upload!"

thx"
