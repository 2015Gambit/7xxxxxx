Hudson Mohawke steps things up a gear with this hyped collaboration with fellow beats maker, Lunice - both representing their respective corners, Warp and LuckyMe. Almost 20 minutes of hyped up,straight to the point, simple (though luscious) and hard bangers, which wears its strong hip-hop influences on its sleeves. These 5 tracks could easily set alight underground dancefloors as well as soundtrack the largest commercial rap and R'n'B stars on the planet.
