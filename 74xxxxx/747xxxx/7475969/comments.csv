,beechyboy,2012-07-26T14:23Z,"You must be bummed out with Demonoid down!!

Thanks for the upload."
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T14:48Z,"its OK they be up.. just more work adding todays torrents when they back up.. not sure how many demon followers come here for backup.. but
I post here as a bup

not many downloading though all torrents today here though.. demon seeders gen more loyal and dont hit and run like here

but Im surprised like over 100 seeders and grabs of mine version over afgs xvids which prob came out before mine"
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T14:49Z,"cant seem to find info why they are down you think
they post a notice page instead of the error page

suspect its a ddos attack since other trackers were hit yesterday"
,tibird,2012-07-26T20:11Z,thanks alot for this one
,xpmule,2012-07-26T21:21Z,"ya i noticed one of my files seeding wasn't getting connected to the tracker (demonoid) thats how i noticed.

and honestly i havn't download much from there ever and the last time was like a year ago..

Demonoid is way over rated and i think its worst than TPB crappier selection and idiots and noobs upload crapy crap.. And yeah people seed over there but so what.. who cares
And i seed there and download nothing and i also couldn't care less who leaches lol

P2P is garbage
Stupid kids that upload an endless stream of stolen garbage from scene groups for the most part.
I've been using torrents since they were invented so this crap ain't new to me..

Search through the daily releases on any P2P site including this one and i just wanna kick everyone in the head.
Being surrounded by morons is tiring and most people simply don't do it.. rather than sticking around they just leave and avoid crappy gay p2p bs."
[V],psspss,2012-07-27T02:47Z,"you should care... more p2p places that arent charging like priv trackers keep the info flowing

demon is way nicer web.. you can edit comments delete and torrents

the community is better and more respectful
if they are all kids which they arent they certainly dont mouth off like they do here"
[V],psspss,2012-07-27T02:48Z,"plus they try to help each other and say thanks in the torrents

it has some bugs in the code side though.. tpb has the trackers sorted better"
,brookelynn2010,2012-07-27T18:44Z,thank u
[V],psspss,2012-07-28T02:07Z,"if you want to find heaps mroe seeders
add this tracker as well.. it may go from 4 seeders
to 20 or 50 seeders like
http://tracker.ccc.de:80/announce"
