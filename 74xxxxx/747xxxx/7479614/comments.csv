,monster.x,2012-07-31T00:20Z,"i was hoping this was some sort of documentary, but everyone stayed in character, and it's basically half an hour recap (disc 1) and then every undertaker match at WM.
even for an undertaker fan this has to be a huge disappointment.

on the other hand, a/v quality of the torrent is fine :)"

I use WinX DVD author - it's free.
Convert video to VOB first with WinX
Select the DVD burner next, add VOB -
Whole process averages 30 - 40 minutes"
