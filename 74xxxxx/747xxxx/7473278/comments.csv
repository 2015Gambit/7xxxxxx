you're our hero(ine)!"
,injiktoplqkto,2012-07-26T19:16Z,Hi! I want to ask you what kind of program do you use to watch it? or it is a secret? no problem :)
,bleslie1,2012-07-26T20:23Z,"Thanks, as always! :)

Not sure exactly what injiktopqkto is asking... but if it's what program is the best to watch the episodes on, VLC media player is my favorite. Windows Media Player is ok, too, but they tend to lag on that one...

If you're asking how she records these, I'm pretty sure she uses DVR. Could be wrong though... B&B doesn't air where I live, so we're all very grateful for however you do it, Msfenmore lol"

,injiktoplqkto,2012-07-26T21:19Z,"yes, bleslie1, we are very grateful. there is no doubt."
,injiktoplqkto,2012-07-27T10:19Z,"and my question was how do you watch?
but I guess some secrets are better left untouched :)"
