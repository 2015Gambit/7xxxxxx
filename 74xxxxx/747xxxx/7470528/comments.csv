,plzwork11,2012-08-31T06:03Z,"so so so glad to see this... needed this textbook for a class and after spending $150 on a single book for a different class, which I thought was going to be HUGE and ended up being perhaps just over an inch thick, I didn't want to do it AGAIN... the most I have ever spent on any other textbooks for classes was perhaps 70-100 max, so hitting $150, are you serious?  all because the professor required the latest edition that was literally published in April 2012?  was it really necessary for us to pay $150 for the book when 3 unit class only cost $144?!!  such a rip off.

anyways, around 1000$ for this semester so far between units and textbooks, and was so happy to have some financial relief, this book would have cost me 62$ for the ebook, or 94-125$ for the hard copy (used/new).  THANK YOU!  i have searched for ebook torrents for every textbook i needed and this is the only one i found, between private trackers and not... lol"
,Sontiago2000,2012-08-31T15:36Z,Is there any chance someone has the seventh edition of this? and why do they make you buy a new book every time when I would be willing to bet only the quizzes have changed between the versions??? bastards....
