Gaddaar | 1973 | Vinod Khanna Thriller | Hindi DVDRip | Phantom

Gaddaar is one of the best crime thrillers of its time. Even at that time such good movies were made in India when most of the movies were masalaThe plot involves 7 criminals successfully performing a heist. Problem arises when one of them turns Gaddaar (traitor) and runs away with all the looted money. His other 6 accomplices trace him for a year and finally come to know that he is hiding in Himachal pradesh,one of the hilly states of India.The group is helped by one small time crook, Raja (played by Vinod khanna) who accidentally comes to know the secret about the heist and demands his share of the looted money in exchange for helping in tracing the traitor. As the group reaches the traitor's hideout and confront the him, circumstances and greed leads to bloodbath, true identity and motive of Raja is also revealed. Not only the plot but the location of the set of this movie is also interesting. Most of the film is shot in snow laden hills of Himachal Pradesh. Background score of LP is also very impressive. The score has been copied from a hollywood western movie of the same time, viz." The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The locations were also probably inspired by old western classics. Overall the movie is entertaining and performances by all the characters is also above the top.
