First of all, don't flame me already, this is my first torrent.

I've been looking for this on the internet for weeks and couldn't find a single file so I decided to make the iso file from the actual dvd.

Tried it already and works perfectly, my only problem is that I have an old pc and it does run well on this.

Nevertheless, if you find some problem with it just tell me, I'll leave my e-mail at the end.

I'd also like to say that I can't seed it 24/7, so if need me to seed at a particular time, just e-mail me, I'd be very glad to help :)

Enjoy it
