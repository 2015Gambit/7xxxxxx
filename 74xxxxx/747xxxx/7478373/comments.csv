,PunkBuzter,2012-09-11T23:57Z,"thanks for the up :) had this game long time ago and i can't seem to find it in the stores anymore, besides my PS2 is broken.
quiet sure it'll run well on PCSX2 though, will return with info.

and, perhaps somebody here interested in sport games for the PS2... i once had a game where you had a hover-board, or like a flying skate-board - flying around in a city doing all kind of tricks but cant remember the name of it. if anybody remembers a title to something like that i'd love to have my memory refreshed, thanks :P"
