Just HalionOne, LoopMash and REVerence are NOT INCLUDED, the rest is awesome!

,PeteMach,2012-08-14T06:33Z,Steinberg Hypersonic http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7461595/Steinberg_Hypersonic_2.0_VSTi_AiRISO_Release_(FIX_ERRORS_) crashes and Grand 2 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6525260/Steinberg.The.Grand.VSTi.DXi.v2.1.AiRISO doesn't get installed when running this version of Cubase 5. Any help appreciated... :)
,noixxx,2012-08-17T13:24Z,"jeromesnail: Try to install the version 1.0 or reinstall your version of NetFramework. 

fang577: If you install, it will not erase any of your cubase stuff, in fact, Cubase 5 will read all of your data, and if you want, you can open the previous projects in the new Cubase too. 

PeteMach: Try to install and restart the computer. If doesn't help, you can install the cubase sx3, to read the vst's first, then you open the Cubase 5 and it will recognize them(after cubase sx3)... Sometimes I do that and solves my problem. "
