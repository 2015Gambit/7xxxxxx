Mint copy of the TMOQ vinyl LP - this is a needledrop of its first play. I was surprised at how good this sounds from the vinyl as 24-96 files - very clear and immediate, with only occasional guitar parts betraying that distant "audience recording" sound. It's a big improvement on the BMG CD version, with less surface noise/hum/static, and with a softer, richer sound than that slightly harsh CD quality audio. And being a higher resolution, lower generation recording, why wouldn't it be? Unedited, this runs 11 seconds slower than the RMG CD version, which, from a cursory listen, is clearly straight off the LP and unedited. The show is very well received by the audience, and George isn't hoarse...

Show identifiers (Track 1):
 0:13 "Hello Long Beach!"
 4:12 "It's very nice to be here, I tell you!"

Edits made:
 1. Sue me sue you Blues - a couple of seconds patched in from elsewhere in the song where the tape became briefly muted/muffled, around 0:53-0:56. Unnoticeable.

2. For you Blue - gap on LP closed and start of song faded in/segued (the song is missing its start on the LP). End faded to merge seamlessly with next track (Side 2 of LP).

3. Nothing from nothing - gap on LP closed and start of song faded in/segued (the song is missing its start on the LP). End faded to merge seamlessly with My Sweet Lord (whose very start is missing).

Artwork included: the original LP artwork is cheap and cheesy, to say the least! A one-sided photocopy on plain green paper to sit in the plastic LP holder, while the LP sleeve itself is just plain white on both sides. It's been tidied up a bit for a CD case, with corrections to the spelling of "Budda" and the name of the first track ("Opening Jam"), and a realignment of the title at the top has (from the left of the page into the centre), but still maintaining its original home-made look.
