Notes:
READNFO - Just to say that the quality isn't the greatest, so please check the sample. My honest
A/V Rating is: A:6/V:6 - Not bad for a first CAM. How watchable it is depends on how desperate
you are to see this. Btw 9.1 on IMDB - Film of the year matey's

Right, tried to keep the file size up there with 26k's to try and reduce the quality loss as much
as possible as the run time on this is pretty beasty. Also thanks to 26k for the hard work on this
I can imagine that the syncing was a real biatch, so great work. Anyway, I just did the standard
tweaks here and there, won't go into detail because I don't want to bore you. But I just pretty
balanced out the colours and got them looking a little bit more natural looking and sorted out the
brightness/contrast. I also tweaked the AR a little to give it a different look. As I've already
said; The quality isn't the best and for the majority this release will be frowned upon. But
check the screenshots and the sample, if you don't like it don't download it. Simple. Haters
gonna hate, Rabbits gonna mate - Enjoy!
