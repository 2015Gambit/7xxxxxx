,carlamatic,2012-07-25T17:18Z,"Thanks for this. Do you have any of their other albums? If so, please do share them. :) Thanks again!"
,elegant_pie,2012-07-26T18:12Z,"I've got the other two on order, they should be arriving tomorrow. I'll rip them in the same manner and upload them; I'll also make a torrent with all three albums in."
,carlamatic,2012-07-30T07:42Z,"Sweet, thanks! :)"
,rupert3k,2012-07-31T12:12Z,"Thanks elegant_pie!
Any chance you could rip the next two albums to individual song files?
Thanks again!"
,elegant_pie,2012-08-02T13:11Z,There will be no individual song files. This is a CD archive in FLAC format with a cuesheet to tell the player where the tracks are. This is to allow you to use this as if it were a CD. If you want separate tracks in MP3 format you will have to convert it yourself.
