Transferred from VHS tape that is almost 20 years old, so be kind in criticism.  I apologize for the static at the 30 minute mark, but it is brief.  No editing was attempted, to save what is an often overlooked section of Grouchos career.  I think the film restoration teams must find content of this kind pretty often.
 Of course, beforehand, the Marx Brothers had a chemistry of mixing music and comedy which hasnt been equaled, but the unique charisma that Groucho personally developed helped him continue in acting on his own beyond You Bet Your Life.
