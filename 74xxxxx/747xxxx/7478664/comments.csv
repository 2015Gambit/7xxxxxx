Since AAX files support images, they are often used for kid's books. AudibleKids has two types of Enhanced Audiobooks: Picture Books and Graphic Novels. The images are automatically shown as the user listens to the story.

AAX files can be played by iTunes and are also supported by the Apple iPod and the Amazon Kindle 2. However, before playing the files, users need an Audible.com account, which requires a subscription fee."
