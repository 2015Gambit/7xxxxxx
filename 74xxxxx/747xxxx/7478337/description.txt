In the hilarious tradition of The HitchhikerΓÇÖs Guide to the Galaxy, Rob Reid takes you on a headlong journey through the outer reaches of the universeΓÇöand the inner workings of our absurdly dysfunctional music industry.

Low-level entertainment lawyer Nick Carter thinks itΓÇÖs a prank, not an alien encounter, when a redheaded mullah and a curvaceous nun show up at his office. But Frampton and Carly are highly advanced (if bumbling) extraterrestrials. And boy, do they have news.

The entire cosmos, they tell him, has been hopelessly hooked on humanityΓÇÖs music ever since ΓÇ£Year ZeroΓÇ¥ (1977 to us), when American pop songs first reached alien ears. This addiction has driven a vast intergalactic society to commit the biggest copyright violation since the Big Bang. The resulting fines and penalties have bankrupted the whole universe. We humans suddenly own everythingΓÇöand the aliens are not amused.

Nick Carter has just been tapped to clean up this mess before things get ugly, and heΓÇÖs an unlikely galaxy-hopping hero: HeΓÇÖs scared of heights. HeΓÇÖs also about to be fired. And he happens to have the same name as a Backstreet Boy. But he does know a thing or two about copyright law. And heΓÇÖs packing a couple of other pencil-pushing superpowers that could come in handy.

Soon heΓÇÖs on the run from a sinister parrot and a highly combustible vacuum cleaner. With Carly and Frampton as his guides, Nick now has forty-eight hours to save humanity, while hopefully wowing the hot girl who lives down the hall from him.


This is my first upload (and if it goes well not my last) so let me know if there are any problems and I'll try to fix them.
