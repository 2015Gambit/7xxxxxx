This is it! All of the known bootleg sources of Woodstock as of 2004. We're working on the new version, but this'll hold you till then. We included Hendrix, even though its officially released, as the official version is missing two songs plus it was edited so much that other parts are missing.
The idea is to get this and then buy the official sources and put your own version of Woodstock Complete together. There's a file included which tells you what cds to buy.
There are TWO versions of the artwork here - one for this Complete Bootleg Woodstock and one for Woodstock Complete (the one you put together at home from official + bootleg sources).
