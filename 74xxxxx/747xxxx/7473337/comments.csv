,sean_nin,2012-07-27T07:53Z,You're awesome.
,Coltbear50,2012-07-28T01:58Z,Thanks very much!
,Luck107,2012-08-06T09:44Z,Why is this version soo much larger than the others?
,ajtrash,2012-08-10T03:17Z,"This version is so large because the files are in .flac format which is a lossless format, which results in much better sound quality.  Once you have them downloaded, you can convert them to a compressed format like MP3 by using a converter such as Softe Audio Converter softe.net or Audio Converter Plus from abyssmedia.com"
,Wonderworm,2012-08-22T11:27Z,"@Luck107 It's 24/192 FLAC, ie. 192 kHz and 24-bit. The highest lossless quality, but a waste of space if you aren't using an audiophile audio setup. For comparison, this album in regular (16/44.1) FLAC will be around 350 MB, ie. more than 2 GB difference."
,tingonner,2012-08-22T16:28Z,"is this ripped from the CD?  if so, FLAC is totally unnecessary.  redbook standard is 44khz, stereo, 16-bit.  FLAC is only useful if the recording was done directly from the live source.  if it's ever downsampled (for purposes of putting on a CD) you've permanently lost the additional fidelity, FLAC format or not."
,MaahLuz,2012-08-22T20:38Z,"lol, at least of all the comments FLAC is better or not?"
,Wonderworm,2012-08-23T10:44Z,"@tingonner It's a web download so the source most probably isn't a CD but the original recording. No loss of quality due to transfer.

@MaahLuz FLAC is of better quality than any lossy codec (MP3, OGG, etc.) but I recommend you download the other FLAC torrent which is 7 times smaller and with virtually no difference for vast majority of listeners."
,Torrentsfan,2012-08-31T23:46Z,"Wonderful torrent.

Could you please upload The Dark Knight OST too if you have in FLAC?

Thanks Whoever you are.
