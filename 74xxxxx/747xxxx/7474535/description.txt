THE MATRIX: PATH OF NEO will follow the story of the blockbuster motion
picture trilogy THE MATRIX, THE MATRIX RELOADED and THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS
and for the first time allow gamers to play as "Neo" and become "The One."
A game of blockbuster caliber, Shiny also worked closely with the Award
winning talent behind the Matrix trilogy to ensure that every aspect in
design, sound and special effects would be authentic to the original
experience.

Gamers will play as ┬ôNeo,┬ö but from the moment the game begins, how the
situations play out, how they handle them, how they deal with the events,
where they go, how people react to them -- it's all up to the gamer.
They may win where ┬ôNeo┬ö failed or find another way to solve the problem
-- the path is now theirs to follow.

As "Neo", the choices the player makes to resolve each scenario and the
resulting consequences may have a different result than the original films.
Alternative scenarios filled with new characters, content and storylines
have all been written and planned by the Wachowski Brothers to expand the
Matrix universe and overall gaming experience.
