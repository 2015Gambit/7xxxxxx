,darklordofspawn,2012-07-26T08:42Z,"Nope.
They upload because they want to share what they have with others for free."

,pussiple,2012-07-31T04:26Z,charles7822777 - what application did you use to burn the images and was it to a cd or dvd?
,woofsnock,2012-08-01T23:51Z,"I'm having trouble - I first just expanded the .ISO files into folders with ISOBuster, and installed everything just fine. However, when I tried to play the game I got a message saying ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart application. I went and burned the game onto 5 disks (I couldn't find any CDs around the house that held more than 700 MB) and tried again, with the first disk in the drive. Same error message. Any advice? I burned them with the Windows 7 software that was already on my computer."
,pussiple,2012-08-02T14:16Z,"woofsnock - Please google DaemonTools or AstroBurn and use of them for the dl .iso files. Nothing about the .iso needs to be modified. Also if you do burn the images to disc, it must be on a cd, not dvd, and the image file sizes will fit."
,pussiple,2012-08-02T14:18Z,"1. Download an application that supports the burning and/or mounting of .iso files.
	There are many of them out there to choose from; DaemonTools Lite, AstroBurn Lite, NeroBurn Lite/Essentials, MagicISO.

	I personally recommend DaemonTools or AstroBurn, some of the most popular and easiest to use.

2. After installing the application, run it. (I'm not sure which app. you have chosen to use), but from the user interface it should be very straight forward and easy to figure out what to do.

	If you choose; TO MOUNT IMAGES
	DaemonTools Lite - will allow you to mount the images, .iso files, to a virtual drive. You may than run the image just as if you had a physical copy of the cd from your computer. The virtual drive will even show up as another ROM drive under 'My Computer'. (assuming you are using windows).
	1. Open DaemonTools and mount the first .iso file of the game. (The game may automatically launch, if not go to 'My Computer', find the BW2 icon and double click it.) On a side note, I recommend running the diagnostics option on the game menu before installing the game to insure compatibility with your computer.
	2. Click the 'Install' button on the game menu. The game will begin installing. When it asks for the next disk, simply unmount the current .iso file from the virtual drive, using the application you have downloaded and installed, and mount the next disc that it is asking for and click the 'Ok' button to continue installing.
	3. If you would like to install the Battle Of The Gods expansion, do that right after you get done installing BW2 using the same instructions in the above steps. After installing the games be sure to apply the official patches, these will solve a bunch of problems you will probably experience during game-play without them.
	4. In order to launch and play the game after installation, you will need to mount the 'Main' game disc to the virtual drive, ""disc1"", again. The disc is required to be inserted, or in this instance mounted, in order to run the game.

	NOTE - If you experience the following issue with the population of adults not dying, or the population of children not growing up and having no adult population or rather any strange population glitch in the game. You will need to run the game from an actual physical disc. (See steps below for burning images to CDs). DO NOT USE A 'NO-CD CRACK' OF ANY KIND. This will guarantee such glitches in the game. Trust me on this one I have had to deal with this a few times in the past.

	If you choose; TO BURN IMAGES TO CD
	AstroBurn Lite - will allow you to burn the images, .iso files, to a disc. These discs will run perfectly as they are exact duplicates of the orignal retail discs, (Including the DRM track).
	1. Open AstroBurn. Insert a blank CD, not dvd. Select the 'Image' tab at the top left. Within the image tab, select the browse button and find the image you wish to burn. To the left of the program, it should show you the current status about the size of your project, very straight forward.
	2. Be sure to select the proper burning device, and set the burn speed to no higher than 16x. Be sure to check the 'Verify' box to verify rather or not the image was burned to the disc correctly. Burn all images to a CD, not dvd or other media format.

	If you experience any more problems with burning or getting the disc to properly read, please send me an email letting me know. I will try to help you some more."

,marilbears,2012-08-05T04:35Z,"HELP! when its very close to installing, it says:
Black & White?2 has failed to install.
Your system has not been modified.
Please re-run the installer to try again.

Error: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

what am i suppose to do? :( i've tried re-installing it over and over again but the same thing happens."
,pussiple,2012-08-05T06:41Z,"Does this happen before the actual install process starts, at the end of a particular disc, or at the very end of the install?
Are you using the default install directory, and does it install any files at all even after fail?

If you are not using the default install directory, try doing so."
,pussiple,2012-08-05T08:05Z,"Also you may temporarily create a folder on your 'Desktop', then copy all the files from all the discs into it. (Do NOT separate each disc into its own folder. Do not worry about the duplicate files, simply say no to the overwrite.)

After you have completed copying everything to the folder, insert or mount the first disc, exit from the autorun menu if it popups, then run the setup.exe file from the folder you've created.

It should install very quickly and without any issues, you will still need the first disc to play the game however.

You may also delete the folder of the copied files after the install completes."
,iamanton,2012-08-09T01:23Z,"i have an issue that after installing the games then patching, when i then try and run the game to play it asks be to use the correct cd-rom. Ive tried mounting every cd now and getting nothing."
,pussiple,2012-08-10T01:56Z,iamanton -- What application are you using to mount and run the disc images? Please provide details as to how you installed the game also.
,theziga,2012-08-17T10:37Z,"Hi , I use virtual clone drive and I downloaded same as u said but still it asks me to put CD in CDrom . "
,pussiple,2012-08-19T09:24Z,"You can always try the steps in the provided instructions to the letter, both the mount and burn method. If these steps fail, you may also try using the no-cd-crack, just be aware of some game glitches that may occur on some systems when using the no cd cracks.

For detailed information on what these glitches are, please Google it.

I want to give a +1 but I can't until it works... have tried burning, using daemon/magiciso/poweriso/virtualclonedriver etc... no luck... am now downloading both cracks... if it works i'll update on a new comment."
,xhound40k,2012-08-26T17:49Z,"Nope, not working :/"
