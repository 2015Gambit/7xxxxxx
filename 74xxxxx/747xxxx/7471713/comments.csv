If you finish it please stay in seed for the others.
Thanks"
,bryentheartist,2012-07-24T23:49Z,what is the quality of these and wjere are all the other seasons? kinda like to watch em all in order like i did with dallas. thanks
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-25T08:56Z,"@bryentheartist: If you search TPB for Dynasty Season you will see that Seasons 1-6 are available.
The quality of this is pretty decent as it is a HDTV Rip from the channel SOAP."
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-27T21:48Z,"At 10 pm GMT+1 or 4 pm NY time I have to shut down my PC for a couple of hours. We have a major thunderstorm coming our way and we can see the lightening and hear the thunder already.
Sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope you'll excuse me. Will be back online as soon as the toughest is past."
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-28T00:12Z,It's 00:12 and I'm back online... thanks for bearing with me but the storm even knocked out TV
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-30T11:44Z,"Tomorrow morning when I get up... around 8:30 am (GMT+1) I will stop seeding this file.
I don't care if you have finished the file and hope to see a lot of comments bitching and complaining.
There are over 30 people that finished the file and as you can see a lot decided to Hit'n Run.
Sorry for the others but I have other sites where I am a uploader and thought I'd do a lot of people a favour by uploading this here.
Not 1 thank you comment, not 1 quality comment, so tough luck on all of you folks."

And I fully understand your irritation with peoples whom dl&run - its a plague man! if I had left all my torrents at some point because of that, 98% of them would be dead. Pity truth. I'll seed because I LIKE sharing good stuff with people. Please come back sometime (like every 6 months) - I bet there will be bunch of people w8ing for you and being VERY grateful that U're back - who knows, may be they even will seed for a long time :)
And now my personal record - my share ration for one of my torrents (Bodyguard) was over 500 and I still was alone seeding it, lol !! There are decent people out there - they may just not find your upload yet !!
Be Safe !"
