Dramat who uploaded Seasons 2-5 gave me the tip concerning smck2009 on youtube.
I found his listing and downloaded all the parts for season 7-8-9 using Free Youtube Download
I joined the multiple 5 parts he did for each episode with Free Video Joiner.
The files are mp4, sorry for that, but I got them from youtube as mp4's. 
I believe that anyone can get their CPU hot and running to convert them into avi's with 25 framerate and either 640x368 or 624x352 video scale size.
