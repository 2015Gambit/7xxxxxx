[T],MrUnpopular,2012-07-25T15:56Z,"I dunno where you're getting these from, but I can always cap this show (SD TVRip, so it'd be lower quality) if you wanna have someone else share it on P2P."
[V],psspss,2012-07-25T16:34Z,"20 has gotten it already and 7 of those have hit and run

Im not seeding this now

if you can source sooner and make better do so.. saves
me wasting 1.5gb to get it and then make a xvid from it for everyone

I had no problems with watching it on laptop
quality is just fine and audio clip on high freqs is all.. since its speech mostly dont matter

no sure what the 720p capper is doing "
[V],psspss,2012-07-25T16:35Z,"the source is appearing on news groups bins

cost cash for data via a provider and a tool like alt.binz to grab it.."
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T14:59Z,mind you people would rather have this over a tvrip :// 
[V],psspss,2012-07-28T02:09Z,"if you want to find heaps more seeders
add this tracker as well.. it may go from 4 seeders
to 20 or 50 seeders like
http://tracker.ccc.de:80/announce"
