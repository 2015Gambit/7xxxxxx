,trenken,2012-07-25T01:05Z,Why is the file size so small for such a long movie?
,eb121209,2012-07-25T01:16Z,"@ trenken

It's obviously a smaller format, douche."
,trenken,2012-07-25T01:46Z,"Blah, everyone has seen this movie at this point. If you want to spoil things, dont wait 4 days after one of the most popular movies comes out after most people have seen it. Spoil fail."
,smknjoker,2012-07-25T01:50Z,@blah546= You sir are a douche
,smknjoker,2012-07-25T02:22Z,"Thanks for the upload from my family and I. without resources like these it would be impossible for us to sit back, forget about the worries of the world, and enjoy ourselves. "
,rcr29budcar,2012-07-25T02:23Z,"@blah546,
             Your a real bastard! I've seen this on multiple pages here.  Yeah, most people have seen it already, but theres probably still a few that haven't. You think its funny spoiling it for people? Its not! It shows what a douche bag you are! You act like some 14 year old who has nothing better to do than spoil movies for people and rub on off every now and then! Thats probably what your doin right now!  Go away! If your going to do things like that, just leave!  Its in no way funny! Its stupid and inconsiderate! Not that you would think of anyone else but yourelf and wackin it all day. Anyway, you get the point! No one likes a douche bag! And you are a definate douche bag!"

Because it's in H.264 instead of shitty old XviD. "

welcome to the internet chump."
,car1015,2012-07-25T06:14Z,"@blah546 Yes you did spoil the movie for a lot people, I did not see the movie yet, so thanks a lot, Why don't you keep your damn opinion to yourself, and are talking about catwoman who kills Christain (Bale) not (bane) get it right. People just want to know about the A/V. A/6V/6 a little dark in some places and sounds like it echo's a little. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU BONE YOUR THE GREATEST."
,tvwatcher7698,2012-07-25T06:50Z,lol so i was lookin forward to see this movie but saw the spoiler alert and just laughed then saw the one person bitch about it and laughed even harder to the person that bitched and complain shut the fuck up its a movie
,vendetta2112,2012-07-25T07:01Z,This is to blah546 i just registered for one sole reason to let you know how big of a punk bitch thing that was to do. I don't find it funny in the slightest to ruin a movie for someone by giving away the ending. I have yet to see it and read your post fuck head thanks.
,vendetta2112,2012-07-25T07:03Z,"Oh yeah forgot to thank Bone thanks man, have been downloading from you for sometime now and i always can count on it being legit. :)"
,vendetta2112,2012-07-25T07:07Z,"That's the whole point in seeing a movie for the first  
time it's to be surprised by the ending. Or else why bother seeing a movie especially if it's the the final movie in a trilogy.  I have been wanting to see this for quit sometime now."
,SignificantOther,2012-07-25T08:17Z,"Shit quality, totally out of focus, and blurry beyond belief.

A=2
V=6"
,earth3,2012-07-25T09:49Z,"@significantother
lol audio may be not that good but vid is defenitely good for a cam

Stop posting misleading comments :D
"
,i6789,2012-07-25T10:02Z,Thanks for your efforts .....

,j5ize,2012-07-25T23:35Z,"Not too bad for a cam, especially the sound.

V:5.5
A:9

Thanks .BONE."
,dolphane,2012-07-26T03:47Z,"had to say it ,

@tvwatcher7698 

you're one of those guys who says something thats completely lame and makes  no sense when they're trying to be cool and sadly never will, everyone was looking forward to the movie, and whether on the internet or in real life, those douchebags who do that are the assholes nobody wants around and they know it but cant help it.

coming from a name like 'tvwatcher', ur also a self loathing douchebag. i laughed hardest at you. (am i cool now too guys???)
"
,dolphane,2012-07-26T03:50Z,"ohh, and since we r talking about stuff that grinds my gears, can anyone who doesnt know how to rate cams please STOP rating them?? every rate on these comments is worthless because you have one or two that know what theyre doing and are rating the cam in comparison to other cams and then every other jackass is rating them agains the imax version they saw in theatres. get a clue."
,tvwatcher7698,2012-07-26T05:37Z,"hey dolphane actually i was watching tv wen i made this name and actually no i prolly have tons of more friends than u its a movie if someone spoils the end of it its not a big deal u dont have to go and be a giant bitch about it sure it sucks but u see its not gonna kill u ya fuckin retard cuz i have a shit load of friends ""had to say it"" am i even cooler now guys???"
,tvwatcher7698,2012-07-26T05:39Z,oh and since were talkin about it u were prolly a dumb mother fucker who didnt know how to spell dolphin right
,snowdog1,2012-07-26T14:14Z,"Looks/sounds ok. Usual early cam probs: a bit dark, a bit blurry, audio not perfect... but worth the download. For those who bignote & complain - get out there and do better so we can comment on your effort.  Another good effort by .bone.  Thanx..."
,iSHARTEDpoo,2012-07-26T22:15Z,Bone is the man....I always look for his releases they've proven better than most almost every time....THANKS BONE...
,Jon._,2012-07-27T07:06Z,"Nice Upload.

Surprising good audio and quality for a cam release!

thanks bone"
,ironymon,2012-07-27T22:08Z,"The video can be half decent, but audio has to be clear so u can understand whats going on even if the video is too unclear. I'll check this out and tell you a v.. i'll also download mirage one and compare them."
,nerdrage12,2012-07-29T08:18Z,"A: 8
V: 6

VERY VERY watchable. There are some random times when the camera goes out of focus for a few seconds (which isn't really that big of a deal because it clears up pretty quickly) but other than that I couldn't ask for more from a cam version."
,SignificantOther,2012-07-29T11:38Z,"@earth3

Who are you trying to fool, this is the shittiest copy out there. The video was bad enough, but shrink it to 700Mb and some of the faces are missing now. It's absolutely hilarious when retards try to claim they have a clue about how a cam should look. Anybody who claims this is a V=8 is just tricking others into DLing it. It's shit, now move on."
,whereiamnot,2012-07-29T17:02Z,"it's watchable...  I wounder who blew up this to 1.8 GB and callin' da stuff TS. This is a cellphon cam rip or from a spy cam rip, so dudes what du ya expect? Imo A4 V3 but for who who has the absolute need to see the last batman movie it is ok. Therefore the content of the movie sucks, who payed off all of these enthusiastic movie critics? I miss Tim Burton's authorship in the early Batman movies :-) "
,whereiamnot,2012-07-29T17:04Z,I meant who blew up this 701 MB file to a 1.8 GB loaf of data to repost it as TS? 
,serdude1,2012-08-01T13:43Z,nice I love batman's attitude 
,ut_bhai,2012-08-22T20:49Z,thumbs up... ok print... but stil.... TDKR!!!! :-D :-D 10 stars to the movie
