                           DESCRiPTiON 

 For years, comedian Jon Richardson has been driven by a quest for perfection, 
 which has dictated everything from his eating habits to his ability to go on 
 dates. People have said he has OCD, but he is not so sure. Here he gains an 
 insight into the world of obsessive compulsive disorders, talking to some of 
 the millions of sufferers in the UK and staff who treat patients with the most 
 extreme form. He also chats to his own family and friends - including fellow 
 comic Russell Howard - about his own condition and meets one of the country's 
 leading experts to find out once and for all whether he is simply a demanding 
 perfectionist or if he has OCD

                                 Enjoy!
