,TyStark13,2012-07-27T13:05Z,Thanks. :) Awesome quality like always. :)
,g8aso,2012-08-01T18:08Z,"I see someone congratulating you on the quality, not sure what is wrong with his ears, as this is only in Joint Stereo so no high frequencies and poor stereo separation. This is the very worst of the 3 MP3 formats, the only REAL stereo is dual channel, that is the ONLY format with 2 separate channels.
It would be nice if you would include this vital quality information in the details. Itâs really pointless using 320 bitrate then spoiling it with joint stereo.
Anyway, thanks for the effort putting it up, but I have had to delete it due to quality problems."
