A little town in the Paraná Forrest of Paraguay is the scenario of this dramatic drama.Isabel Sarli is Isabel,the beautiful daughter of poor farmers,who's love for the sordid Quiroga cuts early her life when both fails to evade a Policial Chase over the Iguazú Falls (in the conjunction of the borderlines of Paraguay,Brazil and Argentina). Unlike other films directed by Armando Bo,here the romantic drama is accented rather than the sexual appeal of her female protagonist (Isabel only makes one nude scene,when swimming at a Forrest River).This dramatic accent will only be achieved balancing both elements,several years later,in "Extasis Tropical";also starred by Isabel Sarli.
