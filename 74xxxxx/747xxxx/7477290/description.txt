How to set up Minecraft:
Copy the .minecraft folder into "C:Usersyour userAppDataRoaming" If you can't find it because it's a hidden folder, then open the start menu and type in the search box %appdata% and hit enter. For win xp users: open the start menu > all programs > accessories > run > type %appdata% and hit enter and Copy .minecraft there.
open .minecraft and start Minecraft or MinecraftLauncher (the Minecraft 1gb and 2gb Launchers start the game with extra ram if run)
Choose a Username (this is very important for multiplayer)
If you like the game support the developers by buying the game and seeding the torrent :-)

When you join you the server, you should see this message: Please register with "/register Password" If you only see: Please login with "/login password" that means the username you have chosen when you launched Minecraft is taken. In that case, close Minecraft and re-open it with a different username.
Press *T* to open the chat, then type "/register and type a password E.G. /register cookies" (Don't type "password or your name" replace it with a word...).
