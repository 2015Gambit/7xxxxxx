,gokuu79,2012-08-10T08:12Z,thank ou bloody finely a dvd rip of this show but no one will seed. eta 3y37w wtf!  i might have to go get the other torrent with all mkv and recorded eps. i rather have this dvd rip but damn. all 30 of you leechers i hope yalls computer dies!
,gokuu79,2012-08-10T08:21Z,yeah when there is more seeders and less scum suckers i will be back
,gokuu79,2012-08-10T08:26Z,and just a thought bloody. if you could convert to mkv or just compress it and cut the size in half more people might download. 27 gb is alot and might scare some people away. even tho it is 7 seasons and 300 somethin eps. 
,DavidAMIs,2012-08-11T05:38Z,I second that MKV compression tip. That would be the best thing for this torrent and for fans all over who want this! Thanks a lot man!

It is only mislabeled, I can confirm that it was ripped from the dvd.  Simply change the ending to .avi and it should be fine."

Then why does it have a different intro than the rest of the videos in the season, have smaller video dimensions, it's louder, and is 220 mb instead of 175 mb like the others? Pretty sure it didn't come the same dvd as the rest, unless they randomly put one of the episodes with a different intro, which is very unlikely."
