,herr_mafrodit,2012-08-05T16:41Z,"Hi

I'm having troubles with the keygen. It doesn't generate enough characters.

Using 10.8, Mountain Lion. "
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-06T22:08Z,"herr , you need to patch it first , the little button on the left side of the keygen"
,noplanno,2012-08-24T21:20Z,Same prob with the keygen. It doesn't generate enough characters. Even if you hit the patch button. Any known working keys around? 
,daniel308,2012-08-26T04:36Z,having the same issue the key gen won't give out enough numbers for activation code 
,santy1,2012-08-29T07:34Z,"I have problems with activation, it went trought where i can copy the key generated by the crack but after clicking next, it says need to contact customer care, and I tried many times to activate again and I fail"
,WONKABA,2012-08-29T08:18Z,"The first time I tried it it didn't work. Just like other people said, there weren't enough characters. Tried it again with a different generated key but the same amount of characters (a few boxes empty and one box only had one character in it) and it worked just fine.  Maybe that some of the generated keys are bad so keep trying. Thanks for making this available."
