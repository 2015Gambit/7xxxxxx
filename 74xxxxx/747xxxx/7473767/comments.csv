[T],PirateBoy,2012-07-26T03:08Z,"@ DevilPirate

I have stopped uploading animes from now on due to several personal reasons.

1. I might complete One Piece seasons because I had started them.

2. I might do smaller animes from now on.

3. I will do anime/cartoon movies in HD 720p quality, manga/comics and PC games (emulation).

4. I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY ANIME REQUESTS FROM NOW ON.

Cheers"
