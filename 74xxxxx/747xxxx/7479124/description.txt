Storyline:
Joan Wilder is a mousey writer of romance novels. She finds a package from her sister mailed from Colombia in her mailbox.
A call from her sister tells her that she has been kidnapped and that bringing the package to Colombia is necessary for her safety and release.
Being fairly clueless, she leaves for Colombia to rescue her sister. She is lost within hours of her arrival.
She is nearly murdered by one of the men searching for the package when Jack Colton, a fairly low life American rescues her.
They begin a journey through the jungle with bullets flying nearby. Is Joan up to all of this?
