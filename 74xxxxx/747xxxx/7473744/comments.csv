,aekiey2,2012-07-25T18:59Z,The real thing?
,Doug1986,2012-07-25T19:13Z,Any chance you can put it up as .avi or .xvid please.
,macnet83,2012-07-25T20:04Z,thank you
,tim1283,2012-07-25T21:50Z,Virus attached
,ictv,2012-07-25T23:20Z,YES THE VIRUS IS YOU DICKHEAD
,ictv,2012-07-25T23:23Z,IS THIS A DOUBLE EP
,xpmule,2012-07-26T00:19Z,"- The guy who rated -1 is a retarded moron !

- Its the real thing because ""ettv"" uploaded it his/her record is flawless .

- If someone make an avi/xvid he will put it up, so no need to ask..

- Its not possible for a *proper video or text file to have a virus

- This is not a double ep because it is not a music album its a tv video.. as stated in the topic title and description.

I'd start calling people stupid etc
but these idiots ""ictv"" and ""tim1283""
are here to spread false information.
As seen before any many other torrents by this uploader and others.
My best guess would be that these 2 pos dirt bags are working for a group that is paid to search for an y popular file sharing activity and disrupt it is as much as they can. This behaviour has been going on for many many years (google it)

Anti-Piracy people are far worse than any pirate.. they use every deceitful and sometimes illegal activity to fight piracy. but if people who pirate are expected to adhere to ethics than don't you think they should have to follow suit ?

People may say Peerblock is a waste of time but i would advise using it anyway..
Download and install it and select enable on the default lists and *maybe disable allow HTTP for web surfing with the tray icon. Its not a complete solution but at least it helps..
Just like what these anti-piracy idiots think do.. they know calling fake isn't gonna do much but i'm sure they think it helps too lol

,zvector,2012-07-26T01:56Z,"Just chiming in to point out that you, xpmule, are the idiot, at least concerning ictv.  He was asking if it was a double episode, which it is, and the filesize is approximately twice as large as normal.  "
,xpmule,2012-07-26T08:16Z,"@zvector you are here to call me names ?
Go fuck your self how bout that ?
There is no need for you to be fucking little asshole if you think i made a mistake.

@ictv
I re-read my comment..
I'm really sorry about that.
I thought you were another person trying to scare people away from the torrent.

I've been wrong like this a few times recently and its ALWAYS because people ask poorly worded or extremely vague questions.. TPB comments can be pretty hard to understand a lot of the time"
,ictv,2012-07-26T23:23Z,That's ok no harm done. But if i had a black skull i would have band your ass for a month
