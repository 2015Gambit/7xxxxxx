The Real Housewives of New York City S05E08
Blinded By the Wine

Ramona, Sonja, Carole, and Aviva meet for lunch to discuss London and the Anniversary Party. Aviva mentions going to Miami with Ramona and extends an invitation to Sonja to be set up with her sex-crazed father. Carole, coincidentally, will be in Miami at the same time. Heather brings Sonja to her office to meet with James Bernard, a logo expert, to help Sonja with her brand, but things go south quickly. Later that night, LuAnn and Jacques host a wine event and invite all the ladies. They have Ramona sit down with the Master of Wines to do a blind tasting, but when she's in the hot seat, they fail to mention it's actually her wine they're showcasing. Sneaky or all in fun? Down in Miami, Aviva and Reid get ready for Ramona and Mario's arrival and when Carole meets up with her good friend Ranjana, she learns some disturbing news about LuAnn.
