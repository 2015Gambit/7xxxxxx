,dash34,2012-07-26T01:31Z,why uploading same shitty prints again n again ?! u suck maxiersk!!
,darkko,2012-07-26T04:37Z,"so, any A V rating?"
,elangton2000,2012-07-26T09:30Z,"Audio: 8
Video: 4

IMO. Audio would be perfect, but it's out of sync in a couple of places."
,mybones29,2012-07-26T09:33Z,"@Dash, are you serious? This is a cam, what do you expect? Go pay to see the movie if you don't like it. "
,SomeGuy1999,2012-07-26T09:35Z,"Thanks for the up bro
Juding from Screenshots this is a CAM and not a very good one, don't get why it is labeled as a TS "
,ty2uppers,2012-07-26T12:01Z,"thanks alot bro, just like thousands of other ppl I appreciate ur work. I am glad u dont listen and take offense to the douche bags that d/l ur files and talk shit knowing they will play the movie they d/l from u cause they r 2 broke to pay @ theatre. PS. someguy, ts means the audio is a line instead of the cam audio. It has nothing to do with the video. I already d/l from sum1 else so I didnt check this copy 2 c if it is a ts(telesync) or not but assume it probably is if it says so. And by u saying, ""Juding from Screenshots this is a CAM and not a very good one, don't get why it is labeled as a TS"" it doesn't appear that u checked audio to c. If I am wrong sry,that is how it looked to me by what u said.
PSS.. Reyz0R,dash34 go to the theatre or d/l from sum1 else if maximersk has shit quality, I may b wrong but I would bet the price of a theatre ticket that he did not email,call or aproach neither of u and make u d/l from him. So dont even check his U/L's if u hav better"
,trenken,2012-07-26T16:49Z,These people are assholes uploading the same fucking video thats been out for 3 days. What the hell is the point?
,Pdid,2012-07-26T17:42Z,"The audio is line audio, making it a telesync copy. And yes, the video is still very blurry (about beta max quality haha) but the audio is leaps and bounds past the other cam versions on this site. The other telesyncs audio is very well done too :)"
,Pdid,2012-07-26T17:47Z,"@reyzhor-It is the same cam but with much better audio soooo....

@dash34-Why don't you risk federal time taping these copies then. I'm sure we would all be blown away by the blu-ray quality YOUR cam uploads would possess. It is a shame, therefore, that you have never uploaded anything. I have not uploaded anything either, but at least I do not mope around like the whiny little bitch you are criticizing other people's work that you do not have the balls to go out and do yourself. Loser."
,Pdid,2012-07-26T17:48Z,Oh and thanks Maximersk. I've enjoyed watching your popularity grow! :D
,MIAMIRON9,2012-07-26T18:00Z,macular degeneration video quality
,trenken,2012-07-26T19:55Z,"Just another version of that awful cam thats been floating around. Not worth it. Its very dark, blurry, constantly goes way out of focus, audio is out of sync and generally just complete crap."
,rodiercz,2012-07-31T02:17Z,"Anyone know run time?
some cams have only 156min but original is 164.. so ?"
