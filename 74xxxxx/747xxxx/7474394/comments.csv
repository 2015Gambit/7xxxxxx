,Greylore,2012-08-13T17:44Z,"I recently installed this on my brand new laptop.  Everything went fine, until I tried to exit, and then it just froze and started taking up 0% cpu usage.  That night, my computer crashed with a very strange blue screen of death.  When I tried to reboot, the BIOS was gone.  Upon connecting the hard drive to a different computer, AVG internet security found a virus in Left_4_Dead_2.exe .  I'm gonna have to down rate this one, because it may have cost me a two week repair and lots of grief with tech support."
,Deog,2012-08-14T12:28Z,"Same thing as Greylore. Whats up with that bruss?

,bruss.aka.durka9,2012-08-14T13:38Z,"to Deog
