[color=red]Plot[/color]

Devastated the loss of his mother and father and determined to isolate 
himself so he will never experience that pain again, a man in his early 
'20s becomes locked into a downward spiral after a last ditch effort to 
overcome his nihilism yields unexpectedly tragic results. Andrew has 
deliberately cut himself off from the world, but instead of ending his 
pain his loneliness only seems to make matters worse. His bleak reality 
growing increasingly dim with each passing day, the dejected hermit 
becomes hopelessly ensnared in the vicious world of snuff films. Still, 
it's not too late for redemption just yet, though with each passing day 
Andrew sinks ever deeper into that black ass. As the warming light of 
salvation grows ever more dim, the man who once shunned the world 
gradually begins pondering the prospect of clawing his way up from 
the darkness.
