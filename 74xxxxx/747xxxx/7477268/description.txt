Britain's Secret Treasures
In this brand new series, ITV1 will reveal the extraordinary treasures and historical artefacts discovered by ordinary people that have changed our understanding of British history. Presented by award-winning journalist Michael Buerk and historian and author Bettany Hughes, the series will map out the 50 key discoveries recorded by the British Museum's Portable Antiquities Scheme since it was set up fifteen years ago, with the order of the list being determined by Bettany and a panel of experts from the British Museum and The Council for British Archaeology. They'll trawl through the almost one million finds of the last fifteen years whittling them down to the top fifty. Each one will be judged on its national importance, beauty, cultural and historic significance.




5)  18 to 11 
Michael Buerk and Bettany Hughes reveal items 18 to 11 in this penultimate edition of the series. Jon Culshaw follows the trail of a hoard of Viking treasure, Dan Lobb investigates a Bronze Age stash of goods that sheds light on Britain's import/export trade with Europe 3,500 years ago, and Anita Rani asks whether a 12th-century metal knight might be a medieval chess piece.
