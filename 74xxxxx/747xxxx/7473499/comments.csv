,enonumus,2012-09-07T06:30Z,"This was handy, but the ENTIRE Bond collection is coming out on Blu-Ray for the first time ever in about 3 weeks.  So, unless you're desperate to watch one of these right now, you're better off holding out for the actual Blu-Rays which will definitely be put up immediately by one of the usual groups."
