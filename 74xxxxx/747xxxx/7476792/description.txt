All Out War is another exciting episode of the critically acclaimed 3D turn-based strategy game "Great Little War Game". Retaining the in-depth gameplay, humour, comical style and graphical excellence of the original game.

Please note that this is not a sequel but a stripped down version of the original game, designed just to allow play of these two extra campaigns. If you don't already own the main game, we recommend you look at that first as it contains more general features and a gentler introduction to the gameplay.

Warning: These levels are fiendishly challenging!

Core Features:

    Campaign mode 
    Four difficulty settings 
    Lush visuals 
    Full 3D terrain affects gameplay 
    Simple control method 
    Lots of units 
    Lots of terrain types 
    High replayability 

Tons of humourTake control of numerous different military units over air, sea and land to pulverise the enemy into submission. There are 2 new campaigns to test yourself against "All Out War" and "Holiday From Hell", both of which will push you and your men to the limit (and possibly give Generalissimo a nice quiet holiday).
You have to battle through desert, jungle, temperate and Arctic conditions to keep your general safe, which is no mean feat given where he likes to take a holiday...

So take control of your men, lead them to a glorious victory and then maybe sit down and have a cup of tea.
