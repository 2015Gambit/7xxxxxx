[V],psspss,2012-07-26T05:47Z,"cos the other xvid isnt seeded

and I dont always like the way afg do their converts

this is really for the demon users but the site is down"
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T06:05Z,and why did you tick -1 you hater
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T06:06Z,its not even seeded out yet.. 10 fake seeders already though
,beechyboy,2012-07-26T14:40Z,I've never had any problems with AFG uploads.
,beechyboy,2012-07-26T14:42Z,Why do you always convert mp4 to avi? I've seen some really great quality mp4 even better than avi.
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T14:52Z,"mp4s are only good if peoples gear play them

afg never adds titles and vlc seems to report
audio funny in the codec info
some of them are out of sync too
and they seem larger.. like 400mb or more

im sure people who download my xvids can tell you more reasons"
,beechyboy,2012-07-26T14:58Z,"Sorry... Didn't mean to hit -1 
Reclicked +1
Your uploads are always appreciated."
,xpmule,2012-07-26T21:02Z,"on a side note..
we *should all know converting video's
is a big no no !
its a lot smarter to just leave it alone..
converting a video simply because you don't like the codec is VERY dumb !
It often negates the intended purpose.
your lowering the quality every time you you resample a video or picture so factor that in when your comparing things in your discussions guys lol

i always have avoided people like the plague that do this.. its a red flag !
Noobs do this all the time because they don't know any better.

I hope you at least took a 720p source if your gonna re encode if not its almost pointless (480p x264 to 480p xvid is dumb)"
[V],psspss,2012-07-27T02:51Z,"it doesnt matter what you think though

thats why 1000s downloaded this version LOL
they want xvid for a reason not cos its the best

so what if its lower then mp4 whos gives a toss

only certainly ego cappers spouting off all time
theirs is the best"
[V],psspss,2012-07-27T02:59Z,"Demonoid down time update here

http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-goes-down-120726/"
,xpmule,2012-07-27T14:01Z,"your right it doesn't matter what i think..

but facts are facts..

i like xvid and defended xvid when the scene rules changed. so im not trying to bash it at all !
But unless people NEED that container (.avi) for their sand alone dvd player or something i would highly advise getting a scene group released x264/mp4 release.

@psspss
i can tell by your response you don't understand what i said. And i can tell it's a waste of time for me to go into greater detail about video encoder details etc
The main point / issue i was trying to bring up was damaging a video for no good reason..

Who's ego are you talking about ? your own ? I was trying to talk to everyone and YOU.
Because the qulity of your release *could have been much higher (I'm trying to help you)
It would have been better to download this,
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7474421/Worlds.Worst.Tenants.S01E07.720p.HDTV.x264-YesTV
and convert that to .avi for those that want it..
Rather than doing what you said in the description.

Anyway do what ever you want..
I havn't said anything this isn't common knowledge.
And I'm no ""ego capper spouting off"".
I'm Just trying to help noobs on TPB ;)"
[V],psspss,2012-07-27T14:35Z,"looks like I guessed right.. its a DDOS
like the priv trackers had

http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-to-suffer-prolonged-downtime-after-ddos-attack-120727/

I thought the fix is easy..any ip calling the site over and over is auto added to the block list"
[V],psspss,2012-07-27T14:45Z,"xpmule.. theres nothing wrong with the xvids i make they are made with settings they will ensure they stay in sync.. im not going for fix sizing. and 2 pass really doesnt improve things much when going from mp4s.. Ive compared
1st and 2nd passes and can never see a difference.. it does improve if going from mpegs though as logn as the file comes out from 330 to 360mb range its good enough for me

if there was a issue with my converts people wouldnt keep downloading them alone keep seeding them.

theres many issues with converting mp4 and mkv to avi.. most converters might work fine making mp4s from ts and mpeg2 but its never smooth sailing making mp4s to other formats
they arent all equal

if you read comments you always hear people saying they hate mp4s and they have problems converting them to avis for their own gear. 

anyhow the mods here didnt like the feuds on formats and sources recently and already deleted 2 people
so best not to keep on about it in torrent comments"
[V],psspss,2012-07-28T02:09Z,"if you want to find heaps more seeders
add this tracker as well.. it may go from 4 seeders
to 20 or 50 seeders like
http://tracker.ccc.de:80/announce"
,xpmule,2012-07-28T05:40Z,"the things i said are applicable to the torrent.
I said what i did for a clearly stated reason.
Which i still don't think you understand
And i believe my comments are constructive, I'm not going around trying to pick a fight with people, i'msimply trying to help people in general so uhh telling me I should be quiet and implying i might get banned is bit dumb lol

and just cause people download doesn't mean anything, you keep saying that as justification for anything you do..

Sorry but i would never download one your .avi's if someone else like AFG did.
Many people know what they are doing and sorry but i don't think you do.
And I'm not saying that to be mean.

People have the right to make an informed decision."
[V],psspss,2012-07-28T09:06Z,"whatever xpmule

==

people might not be aware of a new exploit in most
routers (only came about in Dec 2011)
someone might be using your data!
lucky my router doesnt feature it so is safe
linksys still havent patched it with firmware updates.. only some

you can turn it off using telnet to router and
a command to disable it. but alas linksys
dont offer the commandline to disable
and gui doesnt turn it off. buggy

a feature called WPS that has a admin pin
which is weak.. and allows to find WPA passwords
once its found out in like 2 hours of the attack
