AXE COP - BAD GUY EARTH [Dark Horse]

The amazing and hilarious comic is making its debut as an all-new Dark Horse miniseries this spring! Comics fans and fancy news blogs arent the only ones to take notice of Axe Cop - now the so-called real police know about him, too. And if theres one thing police dont like, its a guy with an axe whoΓÇÖs better than they are at catching and dispatching bad guys! Now Axe Cop and his partner Dinosaur Soldier are being treated like bad guys, not only by the police, but by the president and the army, too! But when a pair of nasty villains barge in from outer space and turn the army into actual bad guys, who gets the call to set things right? Axe Cop!


* Written by a six-year-old and drawn by his thirty-year-old brother!*
