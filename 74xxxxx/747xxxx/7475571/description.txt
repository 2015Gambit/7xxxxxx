Turn Back Time - The Family
In the last series shopkeepers experienced what life was like on the British high street through all the changes of the 20th century. This time three contemporary families live as their own forebears did. They must follow the social conventions of the time, but whether they're destined for luxury or poverty is determined by their family history, which is a nice touch. You just know the posh family (the Meadows) are going to end up in the working-class house but they take to the hardship well, even though daughter Saskia reveals, "I thought we'd do chores when we were on camera but when you said cut, we'd go off, have a chat and a bit of food. This is a bit of a shock." The other families struggle for very different reasons. It seems that living history is a bit harsher than those sepia-tinted photos would have us believe.




3)  The Home Front 
In this episode, the families face life on the home front with Great Britain at war; they pull together to survive and do their bit for the war effort, as well as enduring a night in a bomb shelter; and Susie Meadows finds herself responsible for everyone's safety. The Taylor family are now without servants and, just as Adele finally gets to run her own home, the family is split apart once more as husband Michael is called up for national service and her children are evacuated. With the families in disarray, there is much relief as VE Day arrives, and by the end of the era the close-knit community say goodbye to the Goldings.
