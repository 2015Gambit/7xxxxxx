Building upon the extensive resources of Whitaker's The Electronics Handbook, The Resource Handbook of Electronics offers the most complete collection of reference and tabular data available. It provides the data that engineers and technologists need in a clear, concise format that does away with detailed explanations and presents just the facts-the essential tables, charts, formulas, definitions, and equations with just enough detail to accomplish the task at hand.

This one-stop reference covers a broad range of technologies, emphasizes practical applications, and provides references to more detailed information on important subjects.
