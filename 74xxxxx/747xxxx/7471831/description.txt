Dexter Fletcher's directorial debut WILD BILL tells the story
of recently paroled Bill Hayward (Charlie Creed-Miles), the
feckless father of 15 year old Dean (Will Poulter) and 11 year
old Jimmy (Sammy Williams). Sensing that social services will
be on their backs now their dad is out of prison, Dean
blackmails Bill to stick around and play happy families to
avoid being put in care. Bill reluctantly agrees and soon finds
himself bonding with his boys. But old habits die hard and
becoming a proper father is never going to be easy.
