Jon Lord (& Deep Purple) Discography


This torrent wants to be a simple tribute to the memory of Jon Lord
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lord

who recently left us.


Lord was unique.... since the 60s he travelled in many realms of music:
psychedelic, blues, hard rock, classical... In his art, Bach could naturally coexist with blues and oriental drifts in a truly progressive blend that was his sound trademark...
This discography contains 60 albums:
His solo albums and collaborations.
I made up an "essential" Deep Purple discography which is complete in all the studio albums (even the last ones when Lord has just left, for sake of completness).
In the live section I included the most famous live albums of the 70s era, including particularly the most "symphonic" ones, where the composing art of Lord was pivotal.
I also included the albums of his Whitesnake experience.

All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps. 

Enjoy :)
