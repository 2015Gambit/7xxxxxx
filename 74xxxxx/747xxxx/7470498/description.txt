Pairs of celebrities on terrifying car journeys: as the first series showed, it's a formula with a happy mix of jokes and jeopardy.

Mostly it includes the roads that you have suggested as well as other well known and popular dangerous roads. Have a great time checking these!




3)  Ethiopia 
Comedians Hugh Dennis and David Baddiel drive over 2000km of Ethiopia's death-defying, bone shaking roads, in a quest to reach Aksum, known as the home of the Ark of the Covenant. Along the way they have to compete with truck drivers high on local drug khat, a calamitous breakdown and a shortage of fuel in the middle of the night. At times, it seems like David and Hugh will need a miracle to get them to the end of the road and the holiest place in this deeply religious country.
