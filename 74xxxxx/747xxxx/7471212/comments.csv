,azurearm,2012-08-04T05:39Z,"Isnt it great when people come together. Relatively healthy torrent now. Keep seeding, there are still several people trying to get this large torrent.

Was actually thinking of putting up a new one with the extracted folders and videos instead of the RAR files..."
,boost173,2012-08-04T09:22Z,"Would really, really appreciate if you could find Body Beast!, really been looking for a long time, Thanks :D"
,colorincolorado,2012-08-07T16:20Z,Body Beast would be awesome! There is also another program (relatively new) that i´ve been looking for: Les Mills Pump. just wondering if anybody can do something about it :)
,pwnie,2012-08-09T21:09Z,I got les mills pump if your interested. I too want body beast. I will upload in a few days btw
,pwnie,2012-08-09T21:09Z,"oh, one more thing, do i need to extract all files at once or what? Im not get with rar files"
,azurearm,2012-08-10T03:18Z,"by the way, do you have the accomanying documents? any chance you could upload them as well? specifically looking for the guidebook that has those rating charts"
,colorincolorado,2012-08-10T07:02Z,"pwnie, Body Beast is already up just type it and voilá. can you upload Les Mills Pump pleaaaaaase? thanks"

,pwnie,2012-08-11T01:05Z,"hey man this torrent completely crashed on me, could ya upload the dvds and pdfs instead? Plus I couldn't handle the 36 gigs"
,no1special2012,2012-08-13T21:00Z,What is the password to unrar? Im not going to some unknown site. 
,pwnie,2012-08-15T19:06Z,Hey how do I upload a torrent on here and also can yall keep seeding this please?
,latinachica,2012-08-16T17:38Z,"@pwnie - at the bottom of the page there should be a link that says ""upload torrent"" (hopefully this is for the les mills pump :D) and/or go to the forums (also a link down below) for more help."
,colorincolorado,2012-08-17T18:05Z,"Loved this torrent!!! Does anyone know if there´s any booklet  up there, that comes with the program of course?"
,eduu1,2012-08-17T22:33Z,password?????????????
,no1special2012,2012-08-18T04:01Z,If you folks loved the torrent so much then what is the password to unrar? 
,bigintx,2012-08-19T20:38Z,There is no password to extract...
,colorincolorado,2012-08-20T06:49Z,"@no1special2012 , there is NO password at all!, once you ""extract here"" the very first rar, it automaticly goes on with the others. i wish you good luck , im still seeding it aaaaaaand waiting for @pwnie to ul Les Mills Pump ;)"
,bigintx,2012-08-20T10:21Z,"@no1special, I'm the original uploader...I promise you there's no password required.  You only need to start unpacking the 1st rar file as colorincolorado said.  The program you use should automatically unpack the remaining rar files for you.  And I do not appreciate your accusations of trying to scam anybody.  Maybe you should learn how to properly unarchive files..."

,igodspeed,2012-08-20T12:49Z,Excellent file. Keep up the good work. IS there a book with this download. 
,bigintx,2012-08-20T18:18Z,No book or documents included.  I will scan them and upload them for you guys.
,pwnie,2012-08-20T18:48Z,"okay im uploading it, but ima need some help on doing so please. @ colorincolorado, I got it man. I dunno how to work with ISOs to be honest man"
,no1special2012,2012-08-20T23:20Z,I am looking at one 16gig rar file and one text file with a link to a shady as all get out site. Both were inside the rar file that downloaded. So you mean to tell me some how the torrent got switched and you never included this? 
,colorincolorado,2012-08-21T00:01Z,"no1special2012 : i asume you already downloaded something from this page, but just in case, why dont you try again, delete what you have and click on GET THIS TORRENT, there´s a lot of seeders now, should be fast. you have to se 19 rar 18 of 2gb and 1 of 687 mb ""TBTC.part01""........""TBTC.part19"" bigintix thanks in advance for the documents "
,bigintx,2012-08-21T06:46Z,@colorincolorado and everyone else who needs it... I've uploaded the documents and booklets to go with this program.  Hope you guys enjoy!  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7553159
,bigintx,2012-08-21T06:49Z,@no1special - all parts are only 2gb each.  I'm not sure where you're getting a single 16gb file.
,colorincolorado,2012-08-21T07:33Z,"bigintx thank you very much, if you could seed a litle bit more, then i will continue to do so. pwnie that was fast man, thanks a lot!!"
,no1special2012,2012-08-22T04:25Z,"I redownloaded the torrent and now its a bunch of rars. This torrent as of 8.21.2012 is legit. I take back what i said, and thank you big for uploading. 


Still nothing seems to explain how i got a giant rar file days ago. "
,pwnie,2012-08-22T05:30Z,"so the torrent I uploaded is working, if not plz tell me. I like to help in any way I can when it comes to sharing cool knowledgeable things. Shit if the world was more like a torrent site, there wouldn't be so many problems today."
,colorincolorado,2012-08-22T14:46Z,"@pwnie at least its there, 0 seeders but i guess that´s just a matter of time, i am downloading it, thanks a lot!"
,bigintx,2012-08-23T05:35Z,"No worries, I'm glad you got it working tho. Enjoy."
,adoganlaog,2012-08-26T15:09Z,"No matter what I do, I get the 'Enter Password' screen. That includes extracting the main rar to a folder, trying to extract any one of the raws, etc. 
What am I doing wrong ? "
,adoganlaog,2012-08-26T15:16Z,"Sorry, this isn't the same file I downloaded. Mine was 16 Gig. However, when I try grab this torrent (32 gig) it won't let me because I don't have uTorrent. I can't run uTorrent on my machine, it simply wont run. Is there a way to grab the torrent and still use Vuze ?"
,pwnie,2012-08-28T15:17Z,"okay I finally got this downloaded. I use RarFrog, but its being stupid, is there any other program yall recommend to open up the files. Please help"
,pwnie,2012-08-28T15:32Z,How or what program are yall using to extract these files? I have tried rarfrog and there always seems to be a problem with it. Please help
,adoganlaog,2012-09-03T17:53Z,I used WinRar. Just click the first zip and choose 'extract here'. 
,mikey44v,2012-09-10T23:51Z,"hey guys thanx for pretty fast torrernt, but the problem i have is, it dowloaded 19 rar file, and when i extract they show all the same video but just  different file name, what should i do"
,mikey44v,2012-09-11T00:19Z,ok i see now they all start the same
