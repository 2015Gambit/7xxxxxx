,rcr29budcar,2012-07-25T06:23Z,"I don't know about this one. I'm dloading it now, but out of the ones put up earlier,  the newer ones that say V2 or new audio, are the better ones so far.  Any one you get is gonna be blurry. Thats just the way bootlegs are, but imo these are very decent uploads.  I didn't expect them to be as good as they are. They are by no means HD quality, but they are very watchable, and i'm happy with them. Hope this ones better, but odds are its probably the same as the ones already up.  Don't know if this helps, but thats really all I know to tell you."
,austinhhh,2012-07-25T06:27Z,Screen shots and subtitles please
,pinzmoo,2012-07-25T06:40Z,"I watched froggie100's version and it was very watchable. I like that upper the best cuz he will put info on whats good and whats bad, he really didnt have anything bad to say about it, and after watching it I agree, even the dark parts of the movie were very watchable. It pains me to see this upped by .BONE. with absolutely no info, you are one of the good ones .BONE. don't turn into a douchbag release group like TvTeam."
,StillAlive_Jay,2012-07-25T08:22Z,God damnit. Halfway through some guy comes in with an AR-15 and starts shooting through the whole audience killing the camera man
,reowner,2012-07-25T08:23Z,"A = Same as 26k

,dash34,2012-07-25T11:13Z,"com'on get a dvd or good print please with good audio quality, i know its soon to be asking, but its an amazing movie still wanna watch it the third time but now on A a-9 v-9 kinda print"
,brit_doggie,2012-07-25T11:18Z,"@pinzmoo. man both froggie and bone are the best by far,but sometimes expect the odd bad copy, and stop being a grouchbag pls."
,marshal_law,2012-07-25T11:26Z,"no hard feelings your still bad to the bone but this quality i hope it aint the best one out, just looks like a screen full of blurry boxes (recording through the toilet window again). i do recommend this if your gonna watch it on your cellphone but anything bigger and you'll wish you waited for better. but anyways thanks for the early peak with out pay and 
that faggot up there don't you think its a little to early to start joking bout that shit maybe you should have been there instead of the kid.    "

,aminis,2012-07-26T19:13Z,"@ChasUGC
you're being too generous, i would even say V4

Movie itself was one of the greatest pieces of cinema I have ever seen.
I saw it on batman.crystalscoop.com because it has better quality then this torrent and it worked for my PS3 as well. Best Batman ever!! "

What I don't get is why all cam you get online now are all shit quality, I've seen maybe one good cam copy of a film in almost a year and that was a version of the avengers. Why does it seem no one with a decent camcorder goes to do this and only people who bought a POS camcorder on sale for $199 at walmart and think it;s going to work I mean seriously, stop wasting everyones time and bandwith and unless youve bothered to spend at least $1500 on a decent quality camera dont bother trying..."

im not sure if im even going to waste my time watching this movie, the quality is crap and ive been waiting so long for this movie that i couldnt wait for the DVD/Blue Ray release.
anyone that hates watching movies with bad quality shouldnt even think about downloading this torrent, this is by far one of the worst cam quality torrents ive come across!"

Not bad if you just can't wait.

@ kakashi235. Re Subtitles:
1. put in same folder as film
2. rename same as film, except for "".srt"" extension
3. start film - subtitles start automatically.

Enjoy."
