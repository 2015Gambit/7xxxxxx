No this isnt from a CD and could had been kept in an MP3 format but by using M4A I can lable it better plus it's a much better format and keeps the size smaller while offering better audio quality. Much better then the other versions on here, take a listen and decide for yourself if you dont believe me. I'm sure you will change your mind. :)
