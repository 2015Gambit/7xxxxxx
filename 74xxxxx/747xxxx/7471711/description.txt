Can We Trust the Police

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Adam Deacon, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Growing up in Hackney, Adam Deacon has always been wary of the police and says that he has seen examples of police racism and brutality first-hand, and, as part of the film, we learn that his closest friend David was severely beaten and tasered by the police in a case of mistaken identity - shocking footage of the encounter is shown in the film.

Adam wants to understand if the public's perception of the police has changed - has the mistrust that people in inner cities feel towards the police spread to all parts of the country? His investigation takes him inside different aspects of policing - from firearms training with armed police, who have been criticised for high-profile mistakes, to policing large scale events such as the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley and late night patrols in an average seaside town, to try to understand the job from the inside out.

Along the way he meets people who feel let down by the police and will never be able to trust them again, from a football-loving family who were left hospitalised after being set upon by police dogs and kicked whilst on the ground to a middle-class mother who says police incompetence and inaction led to the death of her daughter, who was stalked and shot by an ex-boyfriend.
