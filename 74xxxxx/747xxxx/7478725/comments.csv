,czar_ayas,2012-07-29T06:03Z,"-No root required.
-Most Android games don't.
-Just copy apk file to device and install using  astro(available on play).
Then copy SD files to androiddata on ur sd card.
-Also remember keep an internet connection open when u play. it does not download a lot so u shud not incur a lot of internet charges."
