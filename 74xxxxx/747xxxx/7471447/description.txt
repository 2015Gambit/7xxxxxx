Karaoke Sound Tools is an easy to use software package for karaoke audio processing. It contains three modules:
Vocal remover to remove vocal parts from CD recordings
Control the amount of bass and treble processing
Remove vocals from non-centered recordings using balance
Adjust vocal removing level and output attenuation
Create multiplex tracks (with vocal in left and instrumental part in right channel)
Key changer to adjust the song to singers voice
change the pitch in -12 to +12 semitone (half-note steps) range
after processing, music instruments have no chipmunk or time speed up or down, holding the tempo the same as if the original studio recorded in your key
you can process karaoke songs with lyrics (BIN and MP3G)
Tempo changer to speed up or slow down the song
change the tempo of the song from two times slower to twice as fast
tempo changer retains the original key of the song
you can process karaoke songs with lyrics -- they will be adjusted to stay in sync

All these tools can be fine-tuned in real time, and work with MP3, WAV, BIN, and CDG files.
If you use a karaoke BIN or MP3G file and use tempo changer, the graphics part of the song will be adjusted so the lyrics are in sync with slower or faster version of the song. No other software has this feature.

Advanced preview allows to:
listen to the processing result in the realtime
control the playback position
play selected part of the song in loop for fine-tuning
