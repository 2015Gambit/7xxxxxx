,Milspec,2012-08-01T22:08Z,I see issues with the lower and the upper models.  The uppers have some weird artifact on the inside between where the charging handle would be and on the AR-15 the little bump on the left side where the mag catch is doesn't seem made properly.

The files were used in machining to produce working rifles,so I'm guessing the problem is in the software used to render. Try with Inventor and adjust settings accordingly,IGES files tend to be peculiar some times."
