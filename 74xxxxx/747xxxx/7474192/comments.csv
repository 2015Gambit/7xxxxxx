,]eep,2012-07-31T03:03Z,"don't bother about the flacs because they are totally screwed up; half are missing (2, 9, 10-19) , wrong channel mapping (seperate C+LFE and Lf+Rf +Ls+Rs files). 

The AUDIO_TS seems ok. You can play it in foobar with foo_input_dvda.dll. Drop AUDIO_TS.IFO in your playlist and you'r good to go. Play 6ch 24/96 or convert to flac. Whatever you want."
