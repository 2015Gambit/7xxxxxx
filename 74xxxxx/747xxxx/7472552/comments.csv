,Seranda,2012-07-26T04:46Z,"What program do you use for conversion? I have tried many... Whenever I get it finally converted to AVI it doesn't want to play on my DVD player from my USB stick. I need ""Drop Dead Diva S04E07"" converted but I don't know how! :( I hate this MP4 crap!!!

I am downloading this now. I will seed for a while when it's done! :)"
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T15:06Z,"I use a combination of tools.. 

you could try the free umile encoder 3.2
very easy to use

however if can fail on some flv and some mp4s
in that no sound or out of sync or weird blurs
occuring at the bottom

but most of the time.. avs converter 8.2 will do it
but again will fail on some mp4s etc as well
and out of sync.. so can alternate the tools 

you will need to select interleave profile and customise it for 640x360p and mp3 cbr 128
and bit rate 1008 and fps default is what I use
except movies I leave width and h to movie specs

and finally run it through avimuxgui to fix
any align on interleave for audio
which is free

if you want more adv tool but less graphical userinterface try meGUI which is free"
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T15:08Z,"you can find a crack of avs video converter 8.2 about
everything else is freeware.. "
[V],psspss,2012-07-26T15:13Z,"avidemux.org is also good for fixing out of sync
on a converted video very quickly without reencoding with the time shift..

however it crashes a lot loading mp4s.. v 2.6 beta is beta but win 7 wont do thumbs once made .. so new header on it or bug.. 

as I said not one tool will do everything properly

umile is darn fastest converter about but so far no 2 pass added to it.. but it will get better if people donate i guess"
