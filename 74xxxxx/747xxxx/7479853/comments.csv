,Ozzen,2012-08-13T10:50Z,"Works perfectly fine on my CFW 3.55 Kmeaw.

What I did:

*Just extracted the SHdownpur.rar file I and transferred it to flash a drive then to my ps3.

(It will take 3-4 mins of black screen before the installation starts and installation will take like 10-15mins.)

I tried both Internal and External HD, works perfectly fine.

Note: Patience is the key ;p"
,GreatSuperAwesome,2012-08-28T05:48Z,"Guys. I load this game through Rogero, then go to menu, press x on Disc image, then ""Loading"" appears on screen, then all. I wait, but nothing happened, just ""Loading"". But then I load it from Install package files, dark screen appears and nothing happened. I wait for 10-15 min, but nothing. Can you help me?"
