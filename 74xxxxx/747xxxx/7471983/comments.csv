Is this the latest one for Bootable USB? As the upload date says its uploaded on 21st July, however Mountain Lion released yesterday?"
,Olarila,2012-07-26T15:59Z,Its exacly the same BUILD ( 12A269 )
,Jero2000,2012-07-27T16:06Z,"If the uploader praises himself in the very first post, my spider senses tingle and I'll stay the fuck away from this supposed crap.

@yungcity: no, you can't use this on your Mac. Strictly speaking, this upload is in the wrong category. It's for PCs that would normally run Windows."
