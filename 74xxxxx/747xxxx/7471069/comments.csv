,uncompromise,2012-07-26T03:59Z,"@numse - you're a first class idiot. I've never bothered to sign up for TPB before, but did so just so I could publicly respond to your lunacy. It's clear you have no idea what you're talking about. How many A-list Australian actors are there in Hollywood? How many B-list? I suspect that you've watched dozens of movies and television shows with Australian actors in them and didn't even know where they were from. As for 'low budget Aussie shit' did you ever see Mad Max? $400K budget and grossed $100 million worldwide. Get informed and get a life."
,injun_mojo,2012-07-27T05:35Z,well theres a numse in every crowd ppl... get over it
,s8n,2012-07-27T06:52Z,"Agreed injun_mojo, butijustcan't resist.

numse... you bag the way aussies speak and you can't fuckin speak english yourself?
Your tone and comments just prove how insecure and lonely a lil hypocrite you really are.

Now be a good lil boy and go play in the traffic. like a good lil boy."

,voltaire64,2012-07-28T02:10Z,any chance of English subtitles for us deaf/HOH folks?
,russTnail,2012-07-28T09:31Z,"@numse....enjoying yourself by insulting decent people is a sure sign that mommy didn't love you enough or that daddy loved you a little too much. 
Mad Max was a low budget Aussie film. need I say more. 
Your'e a fucking oxygen thief.
Thanks scene4all, much appreciated as ever."
