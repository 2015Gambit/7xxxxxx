,Kings420,2012-07-26T00:34Z,Bought from the Mac App store should be legit or I'll be mad :) Like I said I'm using Seed.ST so once it hits 100%on their yall will have it in no time. BTW this is my first torrent let me know what you think once you got it. Also this is from the U.S. App Store. I just browsed the App and grabbed the InstallESD.dmg file for you guys.
,fox3x,2012-07-26T00:43Z,I have very fast internet and am downloading at around 100kbs

,camarada69,2012-07-26T00:59Z,truly and utterly legit? no-one experimented yet?
,paprboy,2012-07-26T01:00Z,Meh... how long to we have to wait for some trusted download? I think i'll just buy it. It's not worth the risk.

,wishdeath666,2012-07-26T02:59Z,sorry for my ignorance... i just have this question... if i install mountain lion and since i am installing a no legal version of the software..once is installed can i still update it every time ? 
,Champion1229,2012-07-26T03:08Z,@masoudd.. Most torrents run around 1.5mb/s on my home connection and if I turn the tethering on my Verizon 4G LET phone I can average around 20mb/s so for me this is unbearably slow!
,Kings420,2012-07-26T03:20Z,Sorry guys didnt know seed.st doesn't allow public trackers got another seedbox its working on getting it too. This is not a VIRUS and this isn't setup for Hackintosh. If you want to use for that purpose you must set it up for that. Once installed you will be able to update as normal. There are many seeds I see some at 70% so it shouldn't be much longer. My internet at home for upload is not the greatest but it will get the job done. Thanks
,Ertavarez,2012-07-26T03:26Z,So nobody Want to Seed?
,Kings420,2012-07-26T03:44Z,I meant peers still only me seeding I only get 600KB upload speed. Be patient guys remember this is free :)
,Champion1229,2012-07-26T03:50Z,"@Ertavarez, i think the problem is when people finish downloading it they start updating which takes away from them seeding."
,wim25,2012-07-26T03:52Z,have patience! I'm at 60% and I will leave it seeding when I'm done.
,Kings420,2012-07-26T04:09Z,Could be I have uploaded 13GB so far and I haven't even got to install it myself. I wanted to share with you guys first so I do hope your happy :) 
,camarada69,2012-07-26T04:23Z,adding trackers from torrentz to the utorrent tracker list actually improves anything at all or I am just wasting my precious time by doing this?
,082710,2012-07-26T04:23Z,wow no one's seeding ;_;
,tunebaby,2012-07-26T04:35Z,ive been downloading this for 3 hours and its only at 26 percent should i try re-downloading it ? plz help
,Kings420,2012-07-26T04:46Z,Im still seeding there are a few more that almost have 100% and hopefully their upload is better than mine :)

,zombird,2012-07-26T20:28Z,"Thanks.
Speed is a bit slow, but it's okay.
As for updating, I'm not sure if you'll be able to or not honestly. I've been able to update ""pirated"" App Store apps that I downloaded from here without any problem. I'm going to assume you're okay. Apple has never really have any verification/serial keys/etc to check for illegal copies of their software.  "
,zombird,2012-07-26T20:42Z,"Sorry, another thing guys, if you ""pirate"" any app store app and want to update it(I'm not sure if it will work on 10.8).... 

1. Go to an app that you have legitimately purchased from the app store(could even be a free app).

2. Right click on the app. Show Package Contents> Contents then copy the ""_MASReciept.""

3. Go to the ""pirated"" app. Right click. Show Package Contents>Contents then replace the 
""_MASReciept"" with the one you copied.

Being that this is an operating system and not an app, I'm not sure if this still applies, you might want to go into the 10.8 app and see if that file is in there by some chance. Again I think you'll be okay, all Apple is doing is changing the updates to be from the Software Update to the App Store. Who knows, you might even still be able to get the updates from Software Update in the future, or even just on their website.

If you have Lion Installation App with which you installed lion. I mean .app file of Lion. Just copy that file in application folder and rename it to Mountain lion .app name (refer this torrents file for that name) and then secondary click on it to show package contents, navigate to SharedSupport, here first delete the existing installESD.dmg and then copy the installESD.dmg from mountain lions folder you have in this file you are downloading.. then run unibeast.. it will run fine.."

,Sindrakes,2012-08-02T06:19Z,Decent download speed and the install went smooth. It seems to be the real deal except that some features are left out. There is no power nap option under power settings and trying to pinch the trackpad will not open tab view for safari. Not a huge concern but it's a pet peeive. All the major features seem to be working ok. Anyone else getting redirected to the App store when attempting to do a software update? Is this the new way that Apple is pushing updates? Thanks.

After you mount InstallESD.dmg you have to mount BaseSystem.dmg and copy ""Install OS X Mountain Lion.app"" in Application section....

Another important thing﻿ is to ENABLE show hidden files or else you wont see BaseSystem.dmg file.

Remember to ENABLE show hidden files before doing all this !!! 

//To do that just open Terminal a copy this code and hit enter:

defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE

//and finally copy this code too and hit enter again:

killall Finder"

 The reason why there no OS updates YET is because 10.8 is the latest ver.    -.-

@stormxeron - What's the point of seeing the installed stats at App Store when u have installed ML?? Update it and reinstall again LOL!!! After u update from L to ML, u can throw away the dmg file. As for updating just click on updates.

,Doomdesire,2012-08-13T07:01Z,"@ sensui76. There are 2 possible reasons. 

1- the app is in ur com
2- glitch in app store

Nyan cat is an app paid game that's not included in mountain lion. So u must have downloaded it or its an App Store glitch (this happens occasionally to apple's appstore when there's high traffic)

Any game downloaded from a torrent file/ file sharing website not from Appstore is non-updatable as the only way to update is using the account that has purchased the app.
Thus, u had an ""unknown error"" trying to use ur id to update that app that can only be updated using trippy's account.

Anyways, IF that app is really not installed in ur computer. U need to ""repair"" the appstore. 
I have 3 solutions for u. Try all.

1- Dismount any other disks/drive which you might have attached to your Mac 

If this fails to solve, restart the dock by:

2- Open the Terminal from /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, then
Enter this commnad: ""sudo killall Dock"" 
(and provide the appropriate credentials)

Still can't? use this last resort- complain to apple

3- Go to itunes support or feedback to apple about ur appstore problem. Just tell them that you have never downloaded nyan cat but it shows an update and someone else's email. OF COURSE dont tell them that ur mountain lion is torrent downloaded LOL.

Anyways, this MOUNTAIN LION update DID NOT cause ur problem at all. This is an appstore problem. I installed ML and had no problems at all.
I hope this helps u :)"

thank you for responding. i did everything you suggested but still no results. i'm still waiting for apple to reply to my email.

am i the only one who's experiencing this?"
,Doomdesire,2012-08-15T15:28Z,"@wizh Ur Welcome!
@Sensui. While waiting for them, I think i know what's the problem since the 2 solutions did not work.

You must have installed some other AppStore stuff from a torrent. (excluding Ml). 

If so, it is highly possible that that cracked app causes the ""Nyan cat update to appear"". 

Reason is because some crackers' method to crack apps is to replace the (receipt)(_CodeSignature)(CodeResources.) in that app from another purchased app. In this case, the nyan cat app.

Btw the receipt, signature and resources are like certificates to show and record that the app is legally purchased. 
Therefore, since ur cracked app has the nyan cat receipt,etc, it shows up to be updated @ the App Store even if u do not have nyan cat.

Receipt can be found by right clicking on the app>show contents>contents>_MASReceipt>receipt , likewise for the other two (code..)

Well. Its kind of hard to explain. It would be easier to see this tutorial on how angry bird is cracked where they replace twitter's receipt etc into angry bird's content.
http://www.mydigitallife.info/trick-to-crack-mac-app-store-to-download-paid-app-angry-birds-for-free/

Thus, even if one is to delete twitter, if ur angry bird app remains, appstore will pop up ""twitter to be updated"" even if u dont have twitter.

If u indeed have torrent downloaded some appstore apps, feedback to me and i'll try thinking of a solution. If not, ignore this and wait for apple :)"
,Doomdesire,2012-08-15T15:36Z,"@sensui76
I did experience something similar to ur ""nyancat"" problem.
In my case, i torrent installed an appstore game called galaxy on fire 2 from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6671089/Galaxy_On_Fire_2_HD.
Well thx to the cracker and the app, appstore now tells me that ""CODEBOX"" needs to be updated even though i dont have that app. 

Personally, i find the cracking method rather stupid. 

P.s. To any readers. This Mountain Lion works perfectly fine and did not cause any of the above stated problems!  :o "
