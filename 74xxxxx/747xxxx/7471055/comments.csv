,xpmule,2012-07-25T03:59Z,"ya not only what he said but this has already been uploaded many times and is heavily seeded.

for example.. (lots of seed + trusted user)

I don't use this app but i have in the past and i thinks a good tool. Th e reason i posted was is its common here at TPB that people keep reposting the same thing over and over. (usually by unknown users)

Uploaders + downloaders REALLY need to learn how to use the TPB search feature !"
