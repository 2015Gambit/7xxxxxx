The Bottom Line

"King of the Hill" Season Two DVD Collection includes classic "King of the Hill" episodes that aren't to be missed. The sophomore season doesn't have the broad humor as the first as the show finds it's audience. Having said that, "King of the Hill" still outshines most TV shows, then and now. Buy it.
