What a twat. Such a confused person. I would recomend you to go and get yourself checked up you might just have a serious mental problem. Or maybe it is your parents fault who could also be hust like you.. GET A LIFE! "

,eroticburps,2012-07-27T22:51Z,"@ CharmeLeon:
I don't prefer watching most of the Hindi Movies coz i can't take too much of melodrama... BUT>>..
Dabangg is a very good Hindi movie. Not much of melodrama and a cut throat film which shows proves and stays to the point. Worth to keep in the collection.
Very good choice of upload.. and a very good Print indeed.."

,kentcave,2012-08-08T06:15Z,"Thank you Ser.

I came here after consulting this list :
boxofficeindiaboodotboocom

No 3 on all-time list. Although not my usual preference of romantic-drama/tragedy, but worth it anyway. Hope it wont dissapoint me like Ra.One sigh.

Any chance for ""Mujhse Dosti Karoge""?
I encountered the song Oh My Darling all the time, yet no tpb up. Please. Thanks."
