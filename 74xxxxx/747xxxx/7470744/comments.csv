,afridi707,2012-07-24T15:55Z, too big file size damn 
,smumdax,2012-07-24T17:17Z,"Why the file size so big ?? And why the unusual format? A TS file ?? What is that ? Sure I can open it with VLC, I'm not a noob... but why use this kind of format that isn't common ?"
,smumdax,2012-07-24T17:25Z,I can't argue with the quality though... wow!
,smumdax,2012-07-24T18:25Z,"However, I having bugs... the image seams to freeze for a couple seconds here and there. Not often, but often enough to get annoying. And no, it's not my computer (because I know someone will say it)"
,shaban96,2012-07-24T20:46Z,"first of all thnx for this awesome upload . Please upload it every week like this.

the reason its 17.56 gb is coz its full HD plus now raw is 3 hours long.
"
,smumdax,2012-07-24T22:27Z,"shaban96: I don't think the reason for it being 17G is because it's HD and 3hours... first, it's not 3h, it's 2h30 (commercials are removed.

Second, Rudos' uploads are full HD, and for a ±1h30 show, it goes around 5Gig. Quick maths, Rudos' upload for the 2h30 show would then be around 9Gig...

I think the REAL reason for it being so big is the codec used (TS). Don't get me wrong, this is a great upload, great quality (except for the freezes I talked about). I just wanted to argue with shaban96 :)"

,shaban96,2012-07-25T02:51Z,"the rudos 1080p are only 29 frames.

this is full 50 frames plus try playing it with media player classic"
,smumdax,2012-07-25T07:07Z,"@Pepe123pep: get out of here

@shaban96: are you really telling me that my VLC player can't play 50fps ?... yeah right... but still, for arguments sake, I did open it in Windows Media Player... same bugs.

So the real question to settle this is: does anyone has the same bugs as I have? The first obvious freeze is around when Triple H starts talking in the Dx reunion segment. Then, almost every time we come back from break, I get stuck on a WWE logo, with sound of the event going, but image freeze for a couple seconds.

Maybe it's my download that's a little corrupt. But it seems quite odd to have the corruption right at the break returns lol"
,aleksa988,2012-07-25T12:24Z,Awesome upload!
,Pepe123pep,2012-07-25T20:34Z,"@smumdax
I downloaded about 6gb and I watched a preview and is the rock´s dvd"
,Pepe123pep,2012-07-26T01:09Z,"ok, I downloaded again and now is raw, sorry for that comment, something troll me and show me something about the rock when I open the file, really strange :S :S"
