RELEASE NOTES

Don't just defy gravity. Command it.

Take on the role of a young father and husband, Davis Russell, who
finds himself thrust into war when his peaceful city is invaded by an
unknown enemy. With his daughter missing and conventional weapons and
tactics all but useless, this ordinary cop and his partner Leo Delgado
will rise up to heed the call of duty, master the fundamental forces of
gravity and save the world.

Features:

Breakthrough Gravity-Defying Gameplay

Learn to maneuver and shoot in an ever-changing state of global
gravity, including weightless gameplay in zero gravity.

Control gravitational forces using your Gravlink device to either
increase or decrease the amount of gravity on a given target.

Command gravity to crush objects in your way, float enemies into range
or even pick up cars to use them as mobile cover.

Pervasive Environmental Destruction

INVERSION has been specifically designed to allow for maximum
destructibility using the "Havok Destruction" module.

Blast through the environments, target your enemies' cover blasting it
to bits or even knock down overhead objects to crush the enemy below.

With bullets flying, seek cover objects in the environment or
manipulate objects to create cover for yourself.
