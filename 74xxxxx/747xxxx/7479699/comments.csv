,raiannub,2012-07-27T16:20Z,"CadĂŞ o Prototype 2?????????????????
where  is Prototype 2??????????????"
,scyris99,2012-07-27T16:31Z,"I think the scene groups must be having problems cracking Prototype 2, which is why its not out yet, It uses SecuROM I heard, and its most likely a newer version of it. If it was just Steam protection it would have been out by a group on the same day the game released. Complaining at extremezone won't help either, he doesn't crack these games, he just helps seed/distrubute them to people, and I am thankful for that."
[V],extremezone,2012-07-27T16:43Z,cubit481 when will be cracked i will upload it
,benoit2,2012-07-27T16:45Z,"I agree with HIKSEZ we need to know how to change the zoom from E to right mouse button , anybody figured this out ????? would make the game better for most of us , but will use E if I have too"

,Morphesto,2012-07-27T18:59Z,No use to download. The game itself sucked. Everything about the game seemed a bit off. If you enjoyed Binary domain or syndicate then you might like this aswell..
,DEKAMOB,2012-07-27T19:13Z,HELP?
,thirdbest,2012-07-27T19:29Z,thnx extremezone ...you're the best ...the game works fine but it's stupid that i cannot change my controlls ...i have a little problem with the game when the game saves in the menu ...i must hit alt+tab so minimize the game and if i press alt+tab again the game works just fine...is a problem because my pc is a little older..

,karlosss999,2012-07-27T21:10Z,"Will be downloading this in a bit, But the sys req say that game wants dual-core cpu... Now it migh be just for performance, but i have seen my share of games (like Rage) that simply refuse to run on single-core... 
Simply put. does youe pc meets the reqs?
2nd possibility... core-game-bug-to-be-fixed-asap...
aka anti-prate thing.
will try on my rig anyway... only 4 gigs...

and Extremezone sad that prototype 2 isn't cracked yet... 
Patience is important for us pirates... ;)"

,infernal92,2012-07-28T01:03Z,"You're acting like bunch of fucking dogs. If you can't wait for Prototype 2, just go and fucking buy it! Stop fucking harassing extremezone! More you cry about it, less chance we have to see it ever.
Piracy is all about patience; It will happen, it's just matter of time. Look at Dablo 3. most of people quit, only real pirates stayed with the project. So, can't wait? Buy it."

,tstreamer,2012-08-01T07:38Z,"For those with troubles while zooming on ""E"":

http://mouseraider.homepage.t-online.de/

Downloaded app and tested it in game. Works like a charm. Just


1. Set the GravLink to E
2. Set the aim (zoom) on any unused key (example ""j"")
3. Exit game, open Mouse Raider.
4. Press Change Settings and set HOTKEY to an unused key of Inversion (example ""backspace"")
5. Also, set BUTTON 2 to J. (or the matching chosen zoom key)
6. Keep Mouse Raider open and start the game



Press backspace to start Mouse Raider ""mode"" ingame.
Press Mouse 2 to zoom 
E to use GravLink 
backspace again to return to normal :)

Better than nothing. Cheers"

Good plot, good twists, decent gameplay, great physics engine. Only problem I had was that there was no default crosshair and I couldn't map the zoom button to RMB; had to use shift."
