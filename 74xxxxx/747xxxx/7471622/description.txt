Engineering Economy, 7th edition, presents a crisp, bold new design using color, highlighting and icons to focus on important concepts, terms, equations and decision guidelines. There are new features, new topics (such as ethics and staged decision making), and new online tools; yet no compromise on coverage, examples, or the well-accepted writing style of this popular text. The preface provides an overview of WhatΓÇÖs New and graphically depicts resources for Instructors and Students. Solved examples, problems and case studies target many of the current engineering challenges in areas such as energy, ethics, the environment, and the worldΓÇÖs changing economics. Approximately eighty percent of the end-of-chapter problems are revised or new for this edition.
