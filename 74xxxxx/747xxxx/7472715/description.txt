Basically an updated-for-the-90's version of the original Addams Family show. The family remains the same: Gomez, Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester, Granmama, Lurch, Thing, and Cousin Itt. They're still spooky, and they still have a lot of neighbors and other outsiders who show up and get freaked out by the family's macabre shenanigans. 

Sourece: French DVDRip from E-mule
What's new: Added Russian and English sound tracks.
