Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Today, Tuesday, July 24 on a jam-packed edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex gets investigative journalist and author of "The Manufacturing of a President," Wayne Madsen's take on the Aurora massacre and the ensuing push on all fronts to regulate firearms as a result. Also Alex speaks to writer-director Joel Gilbert, whose most recent film "Dreams From My Real Father" presents the case that Barack Obama's real father was Communist Party USA propagandist Frank Marshall Davis. 

Alex also welcomes veteran of the Black Panther Party, former Minister of Interior of the Republic of New Africa, and author-activist Larry Pinkney to discuss a host of various topics.
