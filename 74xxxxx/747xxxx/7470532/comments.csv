,ASDFMonster,2012-07-30T21:14Z,"There are about 8 seconds missing around the 6:50 mark. There could be more, I didn't investigate further. I switched to a different source. Gaps and incomplete video seems to be a regular problem with these Secludedly posts.

Also, no closed captions ever on these Secludedly rips, which I guess indicates that the poster re-processes the original stream for some reason. If we're download this size file anyway, why not just download the original/untouched source?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-11T09:31Z,"this is original untouched source. in fact better than other cable/sat providers source since theyre using a modified mpeg2 to use avc. it takes a specific type of equipment and right now closed captioning is not a supported option. the skipping issues have been resolved and werre due to high traffic of viewers hogging bandwidth of hbo's stream, according to them. i can only capture on less busy days to get a good copy. mondays or wednesdays."
