Wreckateer XBLA XBOX360-XBLAplus

Wreckateer is a Kinect game that puts you in control of a castle-wrecking ballista. Wreckateer features physics-based destruction allowing every structure on the field to be demolished down to dust. Hitting a structure a different way will result in a different break.

Take advantage of fully-dynamic destruction to improvise with each shot. Blow a hole through the castle wall, then fire an explosive shot at the castleΓÇÖs base, or use a Flying Shot to glide over the wall and into the castle to pinpoint the weak point and bring it down.

See real-time updates of your friendsΓÇÖ scores, from the high score holder to the score just above yours. Get level-specific challenges and updates to push you on to beating your friendsΓÇÖ scores.

Two player turn-based local multiplayer also supported on every level.

Custom playlists allow you to select from our 60+ levels and play through your favorite moments in any order you choose.
