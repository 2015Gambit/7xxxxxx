I present you with the first ever [as far as I know] anthology written for torrent.
Grassroots to the Apocalypse Chapter one
This is a zombie day by day anthology of peoples blogs and their reactions to the chaos. This is Chapter one. It is written by me and made only for the torrent world. You will not find this as a published book but only as an independent effort for torrenting. Please do seed this, and once it has enough seeds I will do Chapter 2. It is epub format, and is 9.84kb. It has 4 peoples perspective on the infestation of Day one April 2nd 2014. Comments are welcome and appreciated. It is a bit gory and has cussing as any good zombie novel should. Enjoy!
