If someone wants to rotate the pages and crop the black sides go ahead and re-upload!

Being a self-funded university student, I have downloaded many of my textbooks online and unfortunately failed to find this one. So I scanned the book in and have uploaded for all to enjoy, if you have the cash buy the book, its pretty good! :)
