The final West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band album didn't even feature the band's name. Although the title may suggest, this was not a solo effort of Bob Markley, all songs were sung and played by Michael, Danny and Shaun.
Featuring Bob Markley, Danny Harris, and a finally credited Michael Lloyd the album released in 1970. This time Shaun Harris played a minor role, he sang only on Outside/Inside (a superior remake from 1969's Where's My Daddy?) .
This album is an excellent come-back, with beautiful orchestral arrangements by Lloyd
