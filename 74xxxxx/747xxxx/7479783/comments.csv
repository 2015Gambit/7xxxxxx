,steph4098,2012-07-31T17:40Z,"I served with Russell Williams in the middle east.  He appeared to be a very nice man. I actually ate breakfast with him (in middle east) as he asked about my son (I was a 25yr old single mother) and how I was enjoying the tour.  Another MARRIED girl who served with us in the middle east lived beside Cpl Comeau.  This is a very interesting story for those not close to the case but for us, it still brings back so many emotions.  
The actor who played him did a very good job.  Captured his demeanor amazingly. Although the movie manipulated some of the facts, it's still pretty accurate.
