Using a "how to do it" approach with a strong emphasis on real-world design, this book provides comprehensive, single-source coverage of the full spectrum of control system design. 

Each of the book's 8 parts covers a specific area of control--ranging from signals and systems (Bode Diagrams, Root Locus, etc.), to SISO control (including PID and Fundamental Design Trade-offs) and MIMO systems (including Constraints, MPC, Decoupling, etc.).

Features an abundance of real-world design examples drawn from the authors' direct experience, and many real-world case studies divided into Industrial case studies and Laboratory systems (several of which are supported by a virtual laboratory using Java Applets on the book's web page). All examples are supported by Matlab.
