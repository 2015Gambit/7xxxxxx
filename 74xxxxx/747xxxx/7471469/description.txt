The Union: the business behind getting high (2007) DVDRIP
by: Adam Scorgie



Got tired of all the shitty TVrip quality torrents for this great documentary, so I bought the DVD off Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/The-Union-Business-Behind-Getting/dp/B0025XUTKQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1343157876&sr=8-1&keywords=the+union) and ripped it myself. 

If you enjoy the movie please consider buying it, or supporting Adam Scorgie's kickstarter for his follow up film to the union, The Culture High! (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scorgie/the-culture-high/posts/272291)
