When Julia Child told Dorie Greenspan, ΓÇ£You write recipes just the way I do,ΓÇ¥ she paid her the ultimate compliment. JuliaΓÇÖs praise was echoed by the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, which referred to DorieΓÇÖs ΓÇ£wonderfully encouraging voiceΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£the sense of a real person who is there to help should you stumble.ΓÇ¥

Now in a big, personal, and personable book, Dorie captures all the excitement of French home cooking, sharing disarmingly simple dishes she has gathered over years of living in France.
Around My French Table includes many superb renditions of the great classics: a glorious cheese-domed onion soup, a spoon-tender beef daube, and the ΓÇ£top-secretΓÇ¥ chocolate mousse recipe that every good Parisian cook knowsΓÇöbut wonΓÇÖt reveal.

Hundreds of other recipes are remarkably easy: a cheese and olive quick bread, a three-star chefΓÇÖs Basque potato tortilla made with a surprise ingredient (potato chips), and an utterly satisfying roast chicken for ΓÇ£lazy people.ΓÇ¥

Packed with lively stories, memories, and insider tips on French culinary customs, Around My French Table will make cooks fall in love with France all over again, or for the first time.
