no new episode next week or week after.

new season is still TBA."
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-26T21:42Z,"correction: Season 2 was split into two parts, not Season 3.

this is gonna create a confusing mess when the next season starts.

i guess i'll name them S04E**.REAL. (?) something like that"
,PwntSoup,2012-07-27T01:14Z,I would name them for what they really are and let those of us who care fix the files we already have. anyone who wants to keep things organized should grab a file renamer app and use it. (2 cents worth)
,PwntSoup,2012-07-29T16:57Z,this would be season 3 ep 9 if you follow the web site listings
