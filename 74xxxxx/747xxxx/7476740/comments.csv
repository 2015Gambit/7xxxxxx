Some years ago, you could always come back 
and ""re-edit"" your uploaded movies whenever you needed .... 

If you uploaded your DVD, started to seed, and
everything seemed to work .... ( It sometimes did ) ....
.... then there were plenty of time to create your 
presentation-side the way you wanted, without any stress ....

Little bit different these days, and i also believe
that DVD-Uploads lasted a lot longer back then .... !

Aha hehe alrighty =) well yeah you are right =) but I recognized that I spelled MW wrong hehe :P And I hope it will be possible in the future to upload bigger dvd/bd covers in larger scale, and some how I think it would be better if the TPB users would get some kind of points for their uploading, you know like on some other registered sites ""ratio"" and stuff :P

Have an awesome upcoming weekend =) "
