DESCRIPTION:

In this series of lessons we will take an introductory look at particle flow to create custom particle systems. Throughout this lesson, we'll learn how to create a Particle Flow Source and how to navigate the Particle View interface. We'll also learn how to use many of the most commonly used operators to create a particle system that fits our specific needs in our project. 
We'll also learn how to utilize space warps like gravity and wind with particle flow to modify the behaviors of our particle systems. Finally, we'll learn how to apply collisions to our particles and even cause our particles to spawn new particles when they collide with a deflector.
