"The Bar Birthday"

Steve hosts a party for the 50th anniversary of 
the bar bringing back a lot of people and 
memories, not all good. Steve and Melanie 
(series star Valerie Azlynn) uncover a secret 
about the origins of the bar. Jack and Ok Cha 
(series star Jodi Long) quarrel over the 
unearthed details of their courtship. Owen and 
Carol act as wingmen for each other with their 
former high school classmates.
