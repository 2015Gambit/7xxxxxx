Seriously though -  Slott is amazing (pun intended). I always said I dont like Spider-Man - I have done a 180 after reading this series and have even started reading other spider titles."
,Rizzle033,2012-07-27T05:01Z,"haha :D That must have been a bitch to track all those down. I'm just uploading the whole lot so people who aren't on the Spider-Train, or some who have just recently picked it up, can read Slott's sensational run in it's entirety so far.

And to the other Spider titles....Venom. Remender has kicked so much ass on Venom. Great series. I might have to upload all of those!

MrDowntown don't tell Mirrormaster82 but you're my fav uploader! When are you going to get your green skull?"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-07-27T06:09Z,"LOL, its funny -  another uploader got a green skull after like a month and had far less uploads than myself and I was like.. ooh here comes mine - then read on suprbay that they have stopped awarding skulls. Id like one but - in the grand scheme its a stupid thing to want.

Love Venom, Scarlet Spider is my fav, Avenging Spider-man is good. And Im catching up on the 2 Ultmate Spider-man series (peter + miles) and of course Spider-Men"
