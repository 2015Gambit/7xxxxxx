,abhineetm25,2012-07-30T14:57Z,Its not a Tsrip rather a cam rip and its dispointing even after 3 months of release of the movie there is no dvd rip out here.
,nagash72,2012-07-31T17:46Z,abhineetm25**  How can there be a DVD RIP if there is no DVD to RIP? Think about it. DVD comes out in September.
,kabram76,2012-08-01T02:31Z,Dvds come out overseas earlier than over here. I've gotten plenty of dvdrips while the movie is still in theaters or even before.
