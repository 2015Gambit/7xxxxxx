    The title track of the sole album from this obscure Canadian prog band. Released in 1972 on the Good Noise Record label, it's become a minor collectible. The featured track, which had to be edited to feature on air because of its length, has some fantastic organ and flute passages, with a few spooky and interesting bits in between! The album's cover apparently caused a minor stir when it was released.
