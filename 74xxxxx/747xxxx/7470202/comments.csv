""Bachelor Pad"" -- a six-episode competition that features alums from our favorite two dating shows as they reembark on the quest for love (and $250,000 -- how romantic!). There's a lot of love (and loathing) in the room as fan-favorites, arch-rivals, scheming villains and the sexiest participants from the Bachelor franchise reunite under one roof in a new series to compete for $250,000 and perhaps... a ""second chance"" at love on ABC's ""BACHELOR PAD"", premiering MONDAY, AUGUST 9 (8:00-10:00 p.m., ET).
