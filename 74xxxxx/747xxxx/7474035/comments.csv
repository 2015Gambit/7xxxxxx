After being told tens of times, what is it, Mr/Mrs VIP, you don't understand with the search function at the top of this page? Netiquette? Hah?

Not only you duplicated my low volume torrent without checking but you did it with the SAME available file, branded with my username in a watermark. Have you no shame, Mr/Mrs VIP? Will you go to SuprBay and do the right thing or will you stand pigheadedly by your dishonourable action once more, Mr/Mrs VIP?"

First of all ASSHOLE you don't tell me a fucking thing.GET THAT STRAIGHT!

Second of all,I don't download books from other torrent sites,TPB, book sites or you for that matter,I think that's pretty fucking obvious.

For you to sit there and say that I have uploaded the same file you have,because of your supposed watermark that btw is no where to be seen just goes to show how full of fucking shit you are.

Your file is 111MB Mine is 118MB so stop being a fucking liar.

YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-07-25T21:09Z,"@ dynstab2 

And one more you idiot.If you want proof that I don't get my books from the other sites or YOU.I will gladly email you my 700 page book catalog of all the books I have on my servers

ASSHOLE!"
,Farrokhfan12,2012-07-26T02:24Z,"Hey, hey, hey!! What's going on here? Bigbluesea, you are alwasy so pleasant. Please don't allow the accusation, if it isn't true, to get to you. You provide such great books as does dynatab2. What a valuable service. Please, both of you, cut it out!!"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-07-26T03:04Z,"@Farrokhfan12

I'm a very pleasant person,everyone knows that.

dynstab2 is an idiot who thinks he can make me look bad with his BS

I have no problem telling him like it is"

I just finished downloading this book

There are ""NO WATERMARKS"" in it as you claim.You should be ashamed of yourself.BBS has saved me a ton a money and provides many of us with quality books and I'm sure I speak for many.

To accuse someone of something that's not true just to make a person look bad is pathetic on your part.You truly have no shame

Thanx for this up and all the others.Pay no mind to those trying to discredit you.You are a valuable resource to many students trying to get an education in today's economy 

You are appreciated!"

I say, Could i get a copy of that 700 page catalog.
""Let the uploading continue"". Greenland is anyway melting, so we'll have watermarks everywhere whether we like it or not. (What ?! Just trying to cheer things up a bit)."
,zeitsuss,2012-07-26T17:37Z,"Hi BBS, perhaps @dynstab2 would like to copyright his torrents? :)  The needless hassle you get from her/him might stop when she/he gets VIP status her/himself.

I'm looking for some books again but this time on wood carving - they seem to be as hard to find as the stone sculpture ones do!...

Direct Wood Sculpture: Technique - Innovation - Creativity - Milt Liebson

Conversations with Wood, The Collection of Ruth and David Waterbury

Creative Wood Sculpture from Natural Wood - Graeme Bentham

Reading the Wood: Techniques & Projects from a Master Woodworker - Michael Elkan

A Revolution in Wood: The Bresler Collection - Nicholas R. Bell

The Sculpting Techniques Bible: An Essential Illustrated Reference for Both Beginner and Experienced Sculptors - Claire Waite Brown (Editor)

Sculpting Wood: Contemporary Tools & Techniques - Mark Lindquist

Sculpture: Principles and Practice (Dover Art Instruction) - Louis Slobodkin.

...and, whilst I'm at it, anything by Terry Southern (I've 'lost' many books over the years and his were amongst them).

Not to worry if it's not possible.

Thank you for all your unique u/ls

I would like nothing more to be able to get these books but they are very hard to get in Pdf.I would like them for myself and to upload as I have had many requests for them.

I get new books everyday so you never know when they will show up.Keep an eye out :)

I do have a few by ""Terry Southern"" I will upload on my next ePUB flood most likely tomorrow :)"
,zeitsuss,2012-07-27T12:38Z,"That's great, BBS, I'll keep an eye out.

Thanks again!"
,keebler77,2012-07-28T20:42Z,"Bigbluesea,

How do you upload all these books? It's inconceivable to me. Do you have some massive scanning facility? And how do you convert the images into OCR? Even artistic text in pictures and diagrams is recognized. How did you set up all the links and table of contents? How is it that some diagrams have infinite resolution when zooming in?

I understand if you want to keep your process a secret, but I'm burning with curiosity. If you could provide any information or even a vague hint on how you do it, I'd greatly appreciate it."
,SectorVector,2012-07-29T16:34Z,"keebler77, you might get him into trouble with your questions. :)  But your questions made me google and i was pleasantly surprised by some gadgets out there. As for me ""ignorance is bliss"" to quote Cypher (The Matrix)."
,keebler77,2012-07-31T22:24Z,"SectorVector, I certainly wouldn't want to get him in trouble, but it's just so intriguing. A few comments up he says he has a ""700 page book catalog of all the books [he has] on [his] servers."" It sounds like an expensive, industrial-scale operation if he's scanning them all."
[V],bigbluesea,2012-08-01T00:44Z,"@keebler77

Didn't you PM on ""Suprbay"" a few weeks ago???

If that was you,you didn't enable your ""Private Message Function""so I was not able to respond to your inquiry

Yes, that was me. I had no idea it was disabled, thanks."
,TheMysteriousKnight,2012-08-13T03:51Z,thanks a lot mate! great upload :D
