,Skrumpy,2012-07-25T20:45Z,Excellent.. allowed full program and database update! Best version out there!
,not.me,2012-07-26T00:17Z,"Works Fine, Thanks."
,xpmule,2012-07-26T03:10Z,"no offence guys but whats wrong with just saving your driver setup files ?
Thats what i do and i havn't had an issue in ever.

These programs are useless as far as im concerned. And i've worked on pc's for 10 years so i've had people + business's bring every kind of random pc you could imagine.
Real simple good + download + ran/save.."
,xpmule,2012-07-26T03:11Z,"i meant to say Google, Run and then save"
,Darkdragontc,2012-07-26T04:43Z,"Well people have their own different ways of getting them, it works either way. "

,Darkdragontc,2012-07-29T03:10Z,"@shinmarwan 

What motherboard do you have, if all fails you can look in the website for the drivers there."
[T],iahq76,2012-07-29T09:07Z,"@shinmarwan: you are right, same thing noticed by me too, I have used many driver find software's, almost same problem with all, They not update their Database correctly."

,AlexPC7k,2012-09-15T22:54Z,Hell yeah! I like it! ;)
,danerd2,2012-09-16T20:35Z,"can you please fix the crack? it doesn't allow the data base to update, it says that the registration has been complete but than it asks you for the registration key again and keeps doing that. And using the crack puts it back to the old version."
,danerd2,2012-09-16T20:36Z,or can you please provide working serials for the new version
