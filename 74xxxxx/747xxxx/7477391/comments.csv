how is the hindi audio?"
,shaqib19,2012-07-28T00:35Z,384 kbps 6 ch hindi audio from org DVD..
,scout4pb,2012-07-31T05:45Z,It appears to be a Hindi disc release converted to codec AC3 5.1 which would sound excellent if done properly. Unfortunately the English track was only converted to stereo and the file size is too small to carry its claims. Somethings screwed up and I wouldn't waste my time.
