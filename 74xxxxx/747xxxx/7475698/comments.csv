why is everything rared? I run xbmc which plays right from the rar's so i pay a very little price but its still annoying a he*l... and for what advantage? there is no compression provided by rar via video files and i think everyone is past the FTP days where resuming was a problem. 

is it just to eliminate people who are too stupid to handle rars?

*sigh*"
