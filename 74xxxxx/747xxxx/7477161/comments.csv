I've been waiting for this episode for over a week, sadly TvTeam who provided the last 5 episodes on here suddenly stopped posting at the 5th. 

Hopefully they will resume and upload tonight's episode, as I unfortunately missed that one on Tv as well :/

But I am sincerely appreciative of your efforts, LolzoidBeancake! Thank you so much :)

Ham & Andy are the epitomy of hilarity."
,LolzoidBeancake,2012-07-26T17:03Z,"No problem, Lost_Leaf =)
Yeah, I was waiting for ages too, so I'm actually only up to episode 5!
I was hoping someone would upload episode 6 so I could be up to date for tonight, but oh well. I guess if TASTETV, RTM, or SA don't get around to it, I'll be doing tonight's as well XP"
,kramark13,2012-07-26T21:43Z,Thanks for uploading! Channel Nine doesn't make it easy for non Australians to watch their content... 
,aussiewayneo,2012-07-27T09:49Z,"Ok....Firstly theres this on other sites, Hamish and Andys Gap Year S01E07 WS PDTV XviD-RTA and its ral because i just watched. 

Secondly...kramark13, how is that Channel 9's fault. They air it on ch9 and Gem channel twice so what... 3 times being aired isnt enough lol"

,missmel76,2012-07-28T00:12Z,"Thank you for uploading, been waiting for this for ages.

Are you going to be uploading the last episode?

,Lost_Leaf,2012-07-28T18:57Z,"@Aussiewayneo, try not to be so condescending. If you had taken a little time to observe and think, you would have noticed that the Hamish & Andy Gap year you referred to is S1, not S2.. So the one you just watched is the outdated first season. 

And if you noticed, kramark13 indicated that they aren't Australian nor do they reside in Australia. Channel 9 and Gem are channels only available to the Australian public, which explains why they are wanting to download it from here..

Next time don't be so quick to throw stones..

Thanks again, LolzoidBeancake! You don't know how much I appreciated this."
