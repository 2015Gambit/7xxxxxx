I didn't notice it when I downloaded the torrent, but I've wasted 132 MB by downloading r_kelly-feelin_single_(late_night_2012-07-23)-720p-x264-2012-srpx.mkv which was in the torrent.

You might want to not download that file, and for subsequent 'First Crossing' torrents I'll be checking for hidden other files.  I suppose it wasn't exactly 'hidden' but anyway it was there and I didn't want it.

The fellow croons quite well, so I'll be keeping the file, but he's not what I wanted."
