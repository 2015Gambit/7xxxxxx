by Indians, spanning many years. Color, scenery, photography all splendid, with
moving, insightful Frank Nugent script to match (based on Alan LeMay's novel).

"We may still be waiting for the Great American Novel, but John Ford gave us 
the Great American Film in 1956. The Searchers gathers the deepest concerns of
American literature, distilling 200 years of tradition in a way available only 
to popular art, and with a beauty available only to a supreme visual poet like
Ford." - Dave Kehr, Chicago Reader
