,hulivar,2012-08-17T20:35Z,"Also you might have a problem with MKV files if you have DIVX on your computer.  Just uninstall it.  These days all you need is VLC media player.  It literally plays any file.  You don't need to download DIVX, Quicktime, or any other audio/video codecs anymore like you used to.  If your like me, maybe your mad because MKV files would freeze up and you could not delete them.  That is caused by a bug in DIVX.  You can fix it without uninstalling DIVX but I don't really know how.  All I know is MKV files were a HUGE pain in the ass for me when I had DIVX.  In fact I would not even download them EVER.  This was a long time ago though.  The scene has said that they are now only going to upload mkvs/mp4s because of the file size and the efficiency.  So just uninstall DIVX...and if your mad because they won't play on your DVD player well...um buy a Media Player Box they are only 100 dollars and are basically the same thing as having a VLC media player for your TV.  Besides who uses DVD's these days anyway?

Those are only 2 reasons I can think of that you would hate MKV files.  Both are very easily solved...just get with the times.  It is 2012 after all."
