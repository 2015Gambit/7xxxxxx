Any chance of doing a compilation of Richard and Sal phonie phone calls ???!

Those guys are hilarious. Most of the swap shop calls are on YouTube , not all, but a lot. 

However they have a ton of other stuff thats hard to find. 

Also their street interviews. Pure gold "

,ov3rT]-[RoFCC,2012-07-26T03:35Z,I love the street Question's too!!!  Why the long wait latly on the daily shows?
,pow.r.pop,2012-07-26T05:04Z,I think the delay has something to do with the problems over at Demoniod . com 
,IamSkyrim,2012-07-26T14:59Z,@pow.r.pop Why would it have anything to do with noid?
,pow.r.pop,2012-07-26T18:40Z,My guess is thats where he uploads the torrent and he just mirrors it over here. Demoniod has been down for two days now
,IamSkyrim,2012-07-26T22:26Z,"@pow.r.pop

The show is put on WDM first priority, and then here. It isn't until a generous WDMer takes the time to up it to noid."
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-07-26T22:31Z,"There was no Stern Show on Wednesday.  Howard took off I'm guessing because he's tired from AGT the night before and had AGT again that night.  It's BS I know.  They aired an old Sirius show from 2007.

Also,  I post my shows on the WDM Network first.  That is top priority and then I post them here when that's all done.  I have nothing to do with demonoid.  I also have a personal life... this isn't my job.  Sorry guys but I do the best I can."

Guess I had it all wrong.

You would think as much as Howard bitches about his contract he would at least honor the 3 day he has to do. 

He is the most spoiled son of a bitch on radio. Having laughs all day is hardly work. I bet those hands are milky smooth.

Supermodel girlfriend , 500 mill in the bank and he bitches like he needs more.

I love his show, funny sometimes but man , what a pussy he is. 

I feel bad for the people who pay for him and then he takes days off whenever he wants, weeks at a time often too.

Thanks again Wush for the service "
,pow.r.pop,2012-07-27T01:32Z,any chance you could send me an invite to the Network ?
