You have never seen an Aquarium simulator like this! Marine life so vibrant, movement so real. You won't believe your eyes! Indescribable realism and colors.


Marine Aquarium is an advanced screensaver that turns your screen into a virtual aquarium, relying on lots of elements to simulate underwater life.

Although it's just a screensaver, Marine Aquarium impresses mostly thanks to the video quality it provides, but also with the number of configuration settings it offers to the user.The settings screen is actually the one that's more important because it provides access to a large number of customization options, including those regarding the video quality and the fish appearing in the images.First of all, Marine Aquarium can work with any screen resolution, with support for both 16- and 32-bit, but also for widescreen monitors. You can limit frame rates and enable automatic lights, while also benefiting from dedicated options to disable monitor sleep mode and keep the screensaver always on top in window mode. As for the fish that appear in the screensaver, you can pick from a large collection that include no less than 26 species, each coming with information regarding the name, location, diet and adult length.
