,Terehi,2012-07-14T17:53Z,"If this is a bdrip then the ripper should learn to rip better. Most likely this is some r5 or other pre-dvd rip cause just like b1893757 said, picture and especially audio sucks."

,Rush,2012-07-14T19:16Z,"Wow are you people really that stupid, scary?

zakimar said: ""it's stars John Cusack, but I never even heard of it""

Iv'e never heard of ""IT""!!!!!!  ""it"" is the movie ""Raven"" not John Cusack...... 

he didn't say ""him""(Cusack)

he said ""it"" (the movie)

No less than five morons apparently have zero reading comprehension skills.

Other than that little nugget, the quality is great and the subs, well you can look for another copy or just deal with em.

,ust2,2012-07-15T03:11Z," Use PeerBlocker if you're paranoid about infringement.

 You'd be surprised how many sites/companies/etc are tracking you even while just being connected to the net or simple browsing though, lol some sites won't even load when that prog is running (that's a good thing imo)."
,ust2,2012-07-15T03:17Z," So are the subs hardcoded or can they be disabled?

 I just watched a movie last weekend with hardcoded english subs in an all english movie.. not to mention they were about 20min behind lmao, was annoying as hell!"
,ElleSway,2012-07-15T05:45Z,"Downloaded in 15 minutes.
Enough seeders for sure.

NO dramas ie: copyright infringements/passwords/etc

Skimmed through just now and would say A/V 10/9

I'm using a laptop but by the looks of this its  pretty much spot on. Best copy out by far.
I would even go as far as saying its legit when saying it's a BD rip.

As for subs - they are not hard coded. Disable and you're fine. No annoying text or blurred images etc on screen.

Definatly recommend to download. 

Been waiting for this movie for a while now, trailer looks great and actors all do a fantastic job IMO.

Enjoy. :)

btw. THAT is how you review on this site. *nods*"

,docblaze,2012-07-15T10:31Z,"@RUSH 
Sir, the comment was ""No wonder this movie lost money, it's stars John Cusack, but I never even heard of it.""
The subject of the sentence was indeed ""the movie"". The bit about Cusack was separated by commas, which is useful for adding additional information about the subject, so nothing was done wrong. 
You sir, are a tool."
