,diamonddogs,2012-07-31T18:34Z,I was only after photoFXlab 1.1.2 and it's not there.
,diamonddogs,2012-07-31T22:06Z,"UPDATE If your just after photoFXlab 1.1.2 download trial from Topaz website or from first uploader goliretor,then get serial key from Ching Liu.
It's the third one down on the list.
Good luck."
,Shwoops,2012-08-05T01:49Z,"The first installed perfectly, but someone commented that a password is needed to unzip the second .exe file. Anyone can help out with that? Is the password in one of the .txt documents? Anyways, thanks in advance to anyone who can help and to the uploader! :D"
,JeanRenoirJR,2012-08-14T03:21Z,"Thank you very much Ching Liu. KO at first sight.

,diamonddogs,2012-08-21T15:20Z,"@miyousef,
Problem is now that you've posted the serials for all the world to see Topaz will soon blacklist them."
,Shwoops,2012-08-25T10:22Z,":( I hope the serials haven't been blacklisted! Why would you post them, what's the use of the uploader's hard work if you're going to post them?
That being said, has anyone had problems with Topaz on CS5-6? For some odd reason it's force closing on me..."
,dolphj,2012-08-27T08:43Z,First rate torrent.  Works like a dream without any hassles.
,xRush2112,2012-09-03T04:48Z,"hey to all...so i installed this into a portable directory and it installed fine (did not ask for a serial)...the problem is that  the plugsins are not being registered into the system!  

i changed the plug-in directory to the non-standard place i installed the plugins (a directory under my portable PS6 install) and still nothing...anyone have a suggestion??"
,dobrzpe,2012-09-19T01:29Z,"works GREAT!

took me a sec to figure out registering - open your host program (PS or whatever) and load any picture.  this allows you to select Filter->Topaz Labs.  then open each filter individually and at the bottom select Menu->Enter Key!

major props for Ching_Liu on this one!"
