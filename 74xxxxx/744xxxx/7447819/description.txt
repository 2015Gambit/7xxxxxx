[sebaygo1]


Adam is getting married tomorrow in The Netherlands, so this episode is not live. In fact it was recorded on Saturday, the 7th.

This episode consists of material from multiple past episodes' discussions of Adam's research into new natural gas fields and natural gas pipelines (existing and proposed).

There are no shownotes.
