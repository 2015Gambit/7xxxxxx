,KESThai,2012-07-18T10:52Z,"I think this file has an error. When I open it in VLC media player it says no avi index. If I build an index I get a movie that plays for 45 minutes and then abruptly cuts off. NFO here and imdb says it should be over 1 hour (72 or 78 minutes). I have tried to rebuild index using DivFix++ and get the same as with VLC.


please help......"
,doobsie101,2012-07-18T15:11Z,"Hmm.. I use Media Player Classic, from the latest K-lite codec pack. If I let the movie play, it seems to work, if I skip ahead, it seems to freeze. 
hmm. I will see what I can do to fix it, and let you know.
Thanx."
,doobsie101,2012-07-18T16:03Z,"Apparently the movie is either corrupted in the middle, or it is missing data. I will have to keep my eye out for another version.

Thanks for the heads up!"
,doobsie101,2012-07-18T21:50Z,"I have located a version at Megashares, but I do not have an account, and you need an account to download over 550mb.

The file is 963mb.

I will keep looking."
,KESThai,2012-07-19T06:38Z,"Glad but sad to see you've confirmed my thoughts that the movie is INCOMPLETE. Looks like your file may have come from a megashare free download as the file size matches at 550MB each.

I'll wait and see what you can do.
