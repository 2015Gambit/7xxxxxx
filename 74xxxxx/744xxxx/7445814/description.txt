
Recorded September 23rd. 1978. This release 1998 on Columbia Legacy.

Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine (AMG).
Columbia/Legacy's 1998 release of Live at Carnegie Hall: Complete contains the full set of the legendary September 1978 concert that found Dexter Gordon and Johnny Griffin at a peak. Supported by Rufus Reid, Eddie Gladden, and George Cables, the two saxophonists smoke on a selection of standards and contemporary workouts, highlighted by "Secret Love," "The End of a Love Affair," and "Blues Up and Down." Gordon devotees in particular will find this a nice addition to their collections.

NB. Johnny Griffin appears on tracks 8 & 10 only.
