,Dimmis80,2012-07-15T11:49Z,BATBs greatest uploader good girl u deliver us for an another week our soap with great succes.U know i am one of the oldest fun of Bold and i watch it since i was a kid.The thing is that in my country play older episodes and i ofcorse dont like that.But these days bold needs more stories to move on and just not to stuck any more with this Liam-Hope-Stefy trio..They go with this storie for so long now and now it gets old.!I think Liam is going to be all alone and its all his fault.!And where is Dicon.!So i hope for more from bold and again thanks for all of your efforts.I wonder are u going for vacation this summer and if u go do u have a friend to upload for us so we will not miss the episodes on time..??
[T],MsFenmore,2012-07-15T22:55Z,"Hi...no I don´t go on any huge vacations this year..in September I´ll be gone for about 3 or 4 days...but I´ll upload the shows when I´m back...!! 

I agree about the never ending story with Liam and Hope..! Deacon is gone already..he was only there for a couple of shows...also Amber won´t be on very much I´m afraid since the actress not on contract anymore..!! "
,MsMuffet,2012-07-16T04:23Z,Oh Ms Fenmore - such a pity that news about Amber's contract. And of course we all wish Deacon was back on a regular basis (I don't know a red-blooded woman who doesn't think we need a bit of eye candy crossed with a bit of bad boy LOL). Love $Bill but we can always do with more interesting blokes IMHO. Mega thanks for the episodes this week. You're a legend! Cheers from Down Under ;-)
