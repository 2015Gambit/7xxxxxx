Comics and Gaming Summer 2012

Comics and Gaming (better known as C&G) Monthly is a Canadian print and digital magazine 
which made its literary debut in February 2010. C&G Monthly, focusing on comics and gaming, 
was developed when a now discontinued Lucid Media, a comprehensive publication on Canadian 
arts and culture, split into two separate magazines. C&G Monthly's creation was to reach 
Lucid Media's growing audience of comic and gaming fans. C&G Monthly targets a mature 
audience. C&G Monthly provides feature editorials, news, interviews, previews, and reviews 
on comics and video games, video game hardware, and the comics and gaming industry. Although 
C&G Monthly is a Canadian publication, its material contains both national and international 
content concerning its industry of relevance.
