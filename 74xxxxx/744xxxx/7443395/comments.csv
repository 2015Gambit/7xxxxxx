,ScottyD7421,2012-07-22T15:51Z,"Nice effort but would recommend waiting for a better version as there are parts missing from the film. During one fight scene it skips ahead approx 60 seconds cutting out a major part of the scene. Also very dark in places which is basically associated with all cams. Audio was not bad though sometimes out of sync by about 1 second so would suggest VLC player. 

A/7
V/5
