That may be great for people with sight problems, but may be really irritating for others."

,hexrider2,2012-07-18T06:08Z,the commentary replaces a lot of the dialog & sound effects.  Not to mention the sync is slightly off.  the video is sharp but overall it's not watchable unless your blind.  will have to find a better copy :(
