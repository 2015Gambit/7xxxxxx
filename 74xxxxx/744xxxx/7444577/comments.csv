,PyRoX1,2012-07-15T09:41Z,Audio???
,giggedyguy,2012-07-15T11:28Z,"WAAAAAAAAY out of sync, but I expected this as it's taken from an Asian source video. Still, NFT could have tried a little harder. Video actually looks good though! Just have to mess with the audio synching."
,watt-e,2012-07-15T11:30Z,"pretty much same copy floating round a while back, picture is more crispy, but sound still less than ordinary and out of sync. getting there"
,Eaz77,2012-07-15T11:34Z,"Sound is crappy, can hear audience laughing etc."
,frednot,2012-07-15T14:02Z,"So, a crappy TS was renamed R6 WEBSCR.. Yawn... Don't bother downloading this shit. "
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-07-15T14:53Z,"sound out of sync, sometimes as much as 10-12 seconds, but comes right. Can also hear crowd laughing during the whole film and bits of it cut into some asian version, only for short stints - 2 or 3 seconds, but there's a couple of places where the asian dialogue cuts in (especially at the end) that's really annoying. 

Picture is good though, way better than the one that I had (which was the best available)

Someone sync up the sound and this would be a great version.

V - 8.5
A - 5 (the syncing issues really get annoying)"

,superscot81,2012-07-16T03:32Z,"Even if the sound was in synch, which it isn't, the audio is terrible."
,pags2k7,2012-07-16T21:25Z,how can i synch the audio with VLC?
,1337kbps,2012-07-18T02:11Z,"with vlc i went to tools and tracksync and put audio track sync at 0,450s and there you have it. but hey thats just me ;)

,Uploader_Guy,2012-07-19T03:54Z,"This is a cam just to point that out. 
P.S.: This rip has been out for months. Very good quality for cam, but sound is off sync."

This cam seems to be recorded in China. The Asian dialogues are all in Chinese."

,eb121209,2012-07-24T00:09Z,"Tykoon123, might want to upload some screenshots of the actual movie. Not of some stupid banner for bihira.com"
,ropelli32,2012-07-24T01:45Z,Shit Guality
,quimkaos,2012-07-29T08:02Z,"starting sound off sync
Chinese (asiatic) hard coded subtitles with video cropped so you can't see the subs...
webcam sound full of laughs from audience...
sound off sync on/off...

hooo yeha it's a propaganda movie... go back to 1980 and you'll get a lot of this. except it's not against aliens, only the old USSR."
