I think i am getting an uncommon bug with the tracking work , i have 11 trackers and any of them it is showing the normal working tracking service but surprisingly without the seeds indication the downloading speed still beeing distributed and the peers increasing the percentage , i changed 3 times already the torrent program ckecking carefully the configurations but for the moment this ununexpected bug still happen ... well get your file anyway maybe with the time the bug got corrected ... i repeat the file can be download anyway beside this situation on the tracking indicators ."

The most positive point on this movie file it is the correction of the black borders at the fullscreen view , the original had about 25% of the screen with black borders giving a real widescreen perspective to the viewers even for portable computer users , that was corrected giving a fullscreen perspective with all the screen for the viewers ...

Happy movie to all of you ."
