Animations and effects-laden flicks benefits from higher resolution..hence justifying the bigger size.

Drama/comedy with size bigger than 1gb only waste valuable space. We prolly only watched it once and then had to decide whether to delete or not. Most possible..a delete.

This from someone who hold 20+ hdd of 500gb each. Used to be I d/l and save all for later viewing and collection. 
But once spaces are running out (some hdd even stopped working after a year or two..before even I watched the movies in it. Had to search again and re-d/l..for those that I remember)..now I just del once I enjoyed the movie.
Had to stop collecting..stop playing pokemon..lol
Here is to wishing tpb last..forever. Otherwise my heart will broke..from those that escaped my grasp. lol

Psst bro..can up Tangled/Rapunzel with Mandarin audio? (5gb also can, appreciated more in higher resolution =) Love that movie..watched three times already. Nice songs and facial animation. Wanna watch it in diff languages la. Thanks ya. @,-p.."
