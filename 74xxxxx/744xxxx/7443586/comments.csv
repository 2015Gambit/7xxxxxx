HOW DARE YOU GO ON HOLIDAY ;-) hahahaha only joking mate, hope you had a good one, you are the only link to Eastenders I can find on the net it would seem. I'd be the most grateful person ever if you could find a way to upload those missed omnibuses when you're home!! If you ever feel the need to watch tv with a hundred crap ads going through a half an hour slot, I'd be happy to upload some aussie crap for u, thanks pal- You are a saviour to Eastenders addicts globally!"
