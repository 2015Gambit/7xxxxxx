DO NOT DOWNLOAD !"
,Lobotomy11a4,2012-07-16T04:29Z,"Same as above commenter, complete waste of time. File for p/w to the rar never unlocked. Shit like this needs to be nuked off of TPB."
,Jarvoid,2012-07-18T03:13Z,"If there are 167 seeders, could someone just post the password? I can't be bothered to take this wanker's surveys and download his spyware."
,Anthrexe,2012-07-18T03:48Z,"My password was mozaic
Hope that helps."
,Jarvoid,2012-07-19T01:56Z,'Mozaic' appears to have worked - 7zip is decompressing. Thanks Anthrexe!
,stonelbow,2012-07-19T10:51Z,since people are still seeding I guess its safe to say that the pw works?
,spootnik23,2012-07-20T16:03Z,"thanks for the password 

the pass is :   mozaic"
,trallala00,2012-07-21T14:24Z,"Thanks, Anthrexe , 'mozaic' without the quotes works. And no capital letter!"
,Bandjalah,2012-07-22T01:02Z,"The password ""mozaic"" seems to be working.
It worked for me.
Try it out.
Good Quality!

Btw uploader, next time include the password on a place we don't need to complete surveys..."
,norgar,2012-07-23T15:44Z,"Waste of time to download this one. 

Surveys don't unlock the password and the mosaic password starts the unpacking process, but it halts to a grind and say the files are corrupt or the password is incorrect. "
,makalisterx,2012-07-31T00:04Z,'mozaic' without quotes works fine as pwd. Extracted all of them. Good download.
,scottmaui,2012-08-03T20:38Z,"'mozaic' (without the quotes) is not working for me. Just keeps telling me ""CRC error or wrong password"" and extraction stops. 

What extractor are you guys using? I'm on Mac, and tried UnRar, Stuffit Expander and Zipeg all with the same results."
,SpiffyMan1,2012-08-17T23:27Z,PASS IS mozaic. Btw up-loader is a doucher for trying to make a prophet off of someone else's work.
,unixjohn,2012-08-20T13:53Z,RAR!  Download at your own peril
,Madimood,2012-08-21T17:40Z,thanks for the pass :)
