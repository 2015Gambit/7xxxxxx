If you do not understand Slovak or Czech, please visit http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-132342 and see if subtitles in your language are available, since you probably do not want to download a film you cannot understand, unless you just want to enjoy the beautiful cinematography :).
