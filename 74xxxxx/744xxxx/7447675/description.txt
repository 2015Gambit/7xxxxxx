Notes: Well that cam was ok just needed a lot of tweaking, took me some hours
Beside some black borders, video was very reddish. Also, some guys head is
sitting in front of the screen at the bottom, sometimes more left, later on in
the center. Cropped that slightly away, looks good now Colours were off a lot,
video was dark, fixed all that and tried to get colours in shape, slightly
sharpened
Looks nice now
