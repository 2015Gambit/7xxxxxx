Certainly other movies have cinavia, and yet there releases playback on my ps3! NO NOOB HERE! Been awhile since I messed with cinavia protected movies! But just downloaded Jeff who lives at home, and it played back just fine! Just throwing out the CINAVIA PROTECTED comment to save people who dont like WAISTING there bandwidth!!!"
