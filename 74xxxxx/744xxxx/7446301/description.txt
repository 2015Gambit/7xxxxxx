This is the real deal.
Its very easy, download this, install the curse client i have put in this RAR file.
Shutdown Curse client, make sure its NOT running.

Use Task Manager from Windows, find the Curse (when in use) in the list and open that folder.
You will need to follow this.

Once you have found that folder, CLOSE Curse Client fully.
After you have overwritten the DDL file, start up Curse Client like you normally would do, entering your account and password.
Set the program up for update automaticly.
The options on Curse to set downloading to max (20 addons)
Only thing that isnt avaliable is the ┬¿Sync┬¿ function.

This now works with the new Curse Client 5.1.1.370.

ENJOY : - )
