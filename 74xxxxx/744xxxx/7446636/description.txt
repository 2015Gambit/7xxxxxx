System of a Down founder Serj Tankian was born on August 21, 1967, in Beirut,
Lebanon. He and his family immigrated to Los Angeles in 1975. He studied
marketing at California State University and started his own software company
before beginning his music career with the formation of System of a Down in
1995. In 1998, System of a Down signed on to Rick Rubin's American imprint, and
over the following seven years released five well-received albums, the second of
which, Toxicity, thrust them into the forefront of the metal community, garnered
a Grammy nomination, and sold millions of copies. Tankian utilized his success
to influence the political world he often commented on lyrically by co-founding
a nonprofit organization called Axis of Justice with Rage Against the Machine
and Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello. He remained active with System of a Down
throughout the mid-2000s and also released a book of poetry, titled Cool
Gardens, before SOAD chose, in May 2006, to go on hiatus of an undetermined
length. Tankian made use of this sabbatical to record his first solo album,
Elect the Dead, which was released in fall 2007. Three years later, Tankian
teamed up with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra to release Elect the Dead
Symphony, featuring songs from his solo debut backed by a live orchestra.
Tankian's second solo album, Imperfect Harmonies, continued in the orchestral
footsteps symphonically re-imagined debut.
