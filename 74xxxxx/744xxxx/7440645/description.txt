Work Done:
Fixed ar and aspect, split video in couple pieces, removed all visible borders, so no movement will be visible.
Added brightness, sharpness, contrast and slightly colours. Added 20 seconds to beginning so intro was complete,
now the movie is full and complete with no missing parts. Syncing was easy once timeline was on cue.
Audio is sweet, a little noise for a second here and there, but nothing that will hurt your viewing pleasure.
Enjoyed this movie so much. Laughed so hard it hurt, Hope you do too
