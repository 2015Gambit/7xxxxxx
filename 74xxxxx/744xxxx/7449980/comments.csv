,snivijme,2012-07-23T01:55Z,"When trying to replace the originals with ""k'ed"" versions I am getting an error saying:  ""The item “HDR Efex Pro 2.plugin” can’t be moved because “HDR Efex Pro 2” can’t be modified.""  I then authenticate, follow the directions to unlock, and give permissions to allow to read/write but it is still unsuccessful.  Am I missing something here?  This is happening in the Photoshop plugin and Aperture plugin file but was successful in the Nik Software file.  Please help."

Drag the original icons to the trash and flush.
Then drag the k´ed to the folders. Voila...
