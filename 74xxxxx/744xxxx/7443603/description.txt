
SUMMER VENGEANCE TOURNAMENT: The Match we Have all Been Waiting For!!!


 Jul 13, 2012 - Performers: Bella Rossi and Yasmine Loven 



I don't know about you guys, but of all the matches in the Summer Vengeance Tournament this is the one of have most been looking forward to! Bella "The Annihilator" Rossi, ranked 5 vs Yasmine "The Lighting Bolt" Loven, ranked number 10. Yasmine may be new to US but she is one of the most naturally skilled wrestlers I have ever seen on the mat. Her strength combined with her natural intuition as to how to take an opponent down and keep herself out of holds makes her a perfect match for "The Annihilator." Not ot mention she is strong as hell! The Annihilator hardly needs any introduction. Her name says it all. Brace yourself, this is going to be one hell of a match!!!!
