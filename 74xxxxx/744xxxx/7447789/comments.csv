,Gcracker3000,2012-08-09T07:21Z,"This series has nothing to do with glorifying war. This show and several others like it show a big trend in America right now. Americans are buying guns, ammo, and supplies at an unprecedented rate and have been for the past few years. Online retailers, brick and mortar stores, and even manufacturers can't keep up with demand. Something big is coming soon. Take care."

For someone to get into the clique they would need to goto war against nations that America should have an interest in, other than fighting for Israel and globalism.

I love weaponry and army themes but lets not be trapped into propaganda and wars for other nation's interests"
