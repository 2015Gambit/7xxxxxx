Note: This movie was controversial when it came out and judging by todays standards would be more so today. Back then it was the way the police were portrayed, today it would be about the other sterotypes found in this flick. Due to its rather unflattering attitude towards homosexuals not to mention the police, it is doubtful it will ever be released on DVD. Just can't punch a pervert in the face anymore without somebody getting a law passed...gosh, I miss the 70's :o)
