,gveers,2012-07-14T14:13Z,Will you upload 2012.07.14 episode as Attack.of.the.show or?
[V],alexisthebest,2012-07-14T17:20Z,Pretty sure it'll be attack of the show. Might be a bit late though
,gveers,2012-07-14T23:30Z,"Just finished watching this episode now. Chris Hardwick was on fire. Such a shame he won't be able to take over after Kevin. Chris really shines here, he makes Candace look like a bystander. Really looking forward to John Barrowman tomorrow, a 4h show. Thanks in advance to you @alexisthebest, you really are the best."
