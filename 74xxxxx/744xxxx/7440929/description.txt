User Review

Not the greatest Hopalong Cassidy movie, but not a bad effort. After a hard roundup the men of the Bar 20 head into town for some fun. That is all except "Hoppy" (he tells the rest of the boys "I'll see you back here in two weeks, and be practically sober!") and "Pappy" (enjoyingly played by Frank Darien in his only appearance in the Cassidy series). Later joined by "Lucky" the trio have a series of adventures which commence with their being arrested by a crooked landowner. Also prominent is an unusual love story, a curmudgeonly storekeeper, and of course the usual romance involving "Lucky" (Charles Hayden) which ends in plenty of action. Light-hearted and fast-moving throughout.
