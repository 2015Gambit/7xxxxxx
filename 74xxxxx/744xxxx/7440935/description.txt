This torrent contains:

- 'Weapons'
- 'Bring Em Down (Acoustic)'
- 'We Bring an Arsenal (Acoustic)'

These three songs are the US bonus tracks from Weapons (Deluxe Edition) on iTunes (not sure if the Deluxe Edition is available in physical stores in the US).

I know a lot of people from foreign countries are after these tracks...complaining about them not being on their version, when they're unaware that 'Weapons' is after the silence at the end of the Remix of Bring Em Down on their versions - though it's nice to have the song without a long silence in the beginning.	

I'm just uploading it again because when I tried to load the pre-existing torrent file for this torrent (dated 7/5/12) in utorrent it gave me a bencoding error (meaning it probably got corrupted on my end)[you may continue downloading the other one, but it's going to lack seeds]
