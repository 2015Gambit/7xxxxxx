ΓÇ£AndΓÇª?ΓÇ¥ I encouraged him. Xiaolang rarely hesitates in his speech. When he wanted to say something, he said it. 
ΓÇ£HeΓÇÖll be very important in the future,ΓÇ¥ Xiaolang murmured. ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm not sure how to put thisΓÇªΓÇ¥ he paused, mouth rummaging for words. ΓÇ£Something will change very soon, Garth. Someone will be discovered who will change everything. When that happens, you need to trust TrevΓÇÖnor like he trusts you. Much will be lost otherwise.ΓÇ¥
