,Sacriel,2012-07-14T19:03Z,"thanks Junpoppa!

the current issue is #221, or am i wrong? spawn.com says so.

so .. somebody got the #218-221?"
,Junpoppa,2012-07-14T19:29Z,"Sacriel

You're absolutely right, the current issue is 221 but there are no available scans yet. To be more precise there is, for some strange reason, the copy of 220th issue (which I actually  have in my possession  right now) but neither 218 nor 219.
Though I'm sure they'll be out soon and you can count on me to upload them :)))"
