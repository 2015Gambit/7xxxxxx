Bob Dylan's Greenwich Village - Sounds From The Scene 1961 2011

In early 1961, a 19 year old Bob Dylan, having dropped out of college at the end of his freshman year, traveled to New York City, ostensibly to visit his idol Woody Guthrie, hospitalized with Huntingdon's Disease. This 2 Disc Set represents the scene he discovered, the sounds he found 'Blowin' In The Wind' and the artists who were already playing the clubs and bars of the Village upon his arrival. From old timers like Pete Seeger and the Reverend Gary Davis, to the bright young stars of the new wave like Joan Baez, and Phil Ochs.
