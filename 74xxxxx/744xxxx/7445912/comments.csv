When 17-year-old Devon ('Megan Park' ) falls in love with her attractive new math teacher Jim (David Charvet), she'll stop at nothing, including murder, to make sure they end up together. Ingratiating herself with his daughter Annique (Keeva Lynk) and making sure his current girlfriend Rachel (Boti Bliss) and ex-wife Marissa (Judith Baribeau) are out of the way, Devon's obsession takes a deadly toll on Jim's life.
