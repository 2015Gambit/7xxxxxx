I tried the free version of this and its not too bad I don't know what this one is like though.

Also I had an unusual partition error so the free program version failed as did everything else i tried ..like 4/5 other partition recovery programs.

But this is a good program i think

The only thing that actualy did help me was TestDisk (a free partition / file recovery program)
TestDisk is console based but VERY powerfull don't under estimate it because it doesn't use a nice gui. It also has a DOS version available both work really well and they also have a forum if have questions. Less skilled pc users would probably wanna try something like this before trying TestDisk though.

Very Nice upload and thanks for sharing :)"
