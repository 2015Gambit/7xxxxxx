,markofbear,2012-07-15T06:50Z,"Actually took longer to install than downloading, but i blame my shitty computor.

- Awesome game and awesome torrent!"
,elDunge,2012-07-15T17:48Z,I'm waiting for a trusted uploader
,fifth3040,2012-07-16T09:52Z,"An official warning to those wanting to download this torrent: don't. It is loaded with trojans that are severly hard to remove. Wait for a trusted uploader or just leave it be. I'm currently trying to rid my win-system files of the trojan and am having 0% successrate. 

To this uploader: FU!"
,elitedesc,2012-07-16T23:54Z,"I always upload UNTOUCHED scene (and few P2P) releases. See nfo

Sometimes you can get a false positive but they are always safe files."

,foeh,2012-07-24T13:53Z,"unfortunately i cant get it to work, it just starts - black screen - turns back to windows. anybody same issues?"
,foeh,2012-07-24T13:54Z,"edit: oh, and there's an error in the stderr.txt file called ""Entity: line 1: error: xmlParseChunkVIS3"" - google doesnt want to help me."
,bargi,2012-07-30T00:57Z,"hi guys! i have downloaded and installed the game but it works very slowly :( and i dont know why, my pc is phenom x4 3,2 ghz, 4gb ram, geforce gtx 275 so the game should work smoothly. please help!!"
,bargi,2012-07-30T14:34Z,"i think there's someting wrong with this game. i have tried with diffrent pc and it's still same sh*t. game works extremely slowly, cursor moves 5cmâs at a time and my pc has rather good specs. anyone have the same problems with the game?"
,ioannos,2012-07-30T16:03Z,"It works fine on my side BUT there is a major bug! At the very beginning where you collect some items to proceed in the game, there is one item missing from where it should be found. I know that because I couldn't figure out how to proceed and after looking at a walkthrough, there should be a Blowtorch placed under the window on the first scene but there it's not there!"
,din0axis,2012-08-01T10:20Z,"Worked fine but then after i got to the village
center it becomes laggy and crashes every single time... Will wait for a trusted uploader version.
:( :( :("
,Zy2,2012-08-11T02:11Z,"Don't look to the many negative comments above,

The game is working 100% good, only 3 or 4 talks are ""low quality"", but thats not any major problem.

Thanks for sharing :D"
,gamer1989,2012-08-28T22:44Z,stuck!! stuck!! no trojans but stuck!! am runnin it on a 2gb ram...still....stuck!!
,whyspr,2012-09-02T07:08Z,"Nothing wrong with the game whatsoever, poor performance results from outdated components, simple."
,s1raz1,2012-09-05T21:40Z,"Weird, after i escape the prisoner cell, wenever it load the part were the bull is.. game crash.."
,s1raz1,2012-09-06T04:14Z,"Ok, nevermind my comment, for some reason scenery gets corrupted from time to time.
A re-install fix the game."
,nickwafu,2012-09-09T02:27Z,is this game english version?
,nickwafu,2012-09-09T02:33Z,"hey, is this an english version?"
,Vigorion,2012-09-11T14:03Z,"Great upload! Thanks elitedesc! English version, good game, no viruses according to AVG. So don't worry guys."
,Xigor,2012-09-15T19:39Z,"Okay this is weird, When I got this installed and everything at first it ran great no problems except for the intro then when the game started I saved and quit (cuz I got other things to do) now every time I try to deponia.exe it blue screens."
