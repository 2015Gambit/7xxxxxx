                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Show Me Your Money is inspired by a real pay experiment that happened during 
 the 1950s. This television experiment sees one of the country's top bosses 
 taking it upon himself to break the rules and encourage a more honest and open 
 working environment. 

                                 Enjoy!
