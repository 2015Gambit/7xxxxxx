Since the birth of rock'n'roll the royal family has had a love/hate relationship with pop 
music. From John Lennon's infamous Royal Variety Performance joke about rattling jewellery 
to the Sex Pistols preaching anarchy in the year of the Silver Jubilee and today's pop stars 
lining up to be seen with the young princes, this is the story of the 'rock and royal years'.

This hour-long documentary helps celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee by looking back at 
the 60 year relationship between pop and the royals - at the times they came harmoniously 
together, and at the times when pop republicanism threatened to tear the monarchy apart.

Singer Tommy Steele talks about being one of the first rock'n'rollers to perform in front 
of the Queen, Sheila Ferguson from the Three Degrees reveals what Prince Charles really 
said to her at their concert in the run up to his 30th birthday, and Queen guitarist 
Brian May talks about what it was like to play on top of Buckingham Palace in front of 
millions of viewers worldwide.

Together these stories reveal why Queen Elizabeth really is 'the rock'n'roll Queen'.
