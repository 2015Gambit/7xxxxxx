Plot: On the same night that he was crowned an NCAA wrestling champion, Dillon McCabe (Wes Chatham) was involved in the killing of a cop and then sentenced to fifteen years of prison. Ten years later, Dillon is paroled back onto the streets of his run-down Baton Rouge neighborhood. Before he can pick up the pieces of his life, his best friend gets in trouble with a vicious loan shark. To get the money to free him, Dillon must return to fighting – this time, mixed martial arts. But his quick, brutal success gets him into more trouble than ever. And after three vicious triumphs, he discovers that his real opponent is a corrupt system that requires him to do the impossible: lose.
