,thekilldance,2012-07-21T10:22Z,"Thanks so much for the tutorial. Everything worked great. I did have to update my .NET Framework to 4.0, but no other issues. I'm very curious, can I try performing any updates after installing with this method? I can absolutely ignore them if that's the sacrifice for the free software, but would like to know if you've attempted this with any of the programs. Thanks again! Will seed for at least a month!"

Hope this helps ;-)"
