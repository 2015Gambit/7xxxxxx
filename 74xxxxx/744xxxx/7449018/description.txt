Thank you very much for your assistance in helping me with reinstalling SolSuite. I've been able to beat several of the games more than once and that is what makes this program fun. I've have thoroughly enjoyed SolSuite for several years and that is why I contacted you for assistance. Again thanks from the bottom of my heart for your assistance.
