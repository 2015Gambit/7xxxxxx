First, delete these two folders:

?:UsersAll UsersTreeCardGamesSolSuite
and
?:ProgramDataTreeCardGamesSolSuite

or, if you're using Windows XP:

?:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication DataTreeCardGamesSolSuite
and
?:Documents and SettingsUSER_NAMEApplication DataSolSuite

Then, go to the registry (regedit), and delete the following key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareTreeCardGamesCommonABSol

After doing these two steps, I could finally activate SolSuite without it getting back to the Trial mode. Thanks to the original provider of this information!"
