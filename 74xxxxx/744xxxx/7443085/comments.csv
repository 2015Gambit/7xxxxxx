,sue111,2012-08-20T11:35Z,"Hi @CakeMonster I have a huuuuuge favour to ask of you!! I have downloaded all Kardashian Seasons and am upto date to the current season 7. What I do want is all the Spin offs so I really dont want to redownload the seasons, is it possible to do a megapack of only the Spinoffs so I can download those only? I will really appreciate it. Thanks a million ;)"

You can de-select the season 1-6 when you have this torrent in your program, just paus the torrent then select the the episodes you do not want by clicking on one and the shift click on the last and then right click and choose don't download "
