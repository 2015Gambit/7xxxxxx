however....REALLY BAD MOVIE ALERT!! lol
For 10 year olds and morons this one. I'd be more comprehensive but this movie doesn't deserve any more of my time to be spent on it. Stay away! It's not even so bad that it's funny....it's worse than that. "
,realpeoplepirate,2012-07-17T08:11Z,"woops meant TY tykoon ;) lol
Just hated this movie so much, what a waste of my time, don't want anyone else to suffer. I shoulda known but I thot I'd giv it a go, can't believe its above 3 on IMDB and people are DL'n it here...and hey I know its free...but IT IS SHIT! and they need to get the message not 2 make this pish like :("
