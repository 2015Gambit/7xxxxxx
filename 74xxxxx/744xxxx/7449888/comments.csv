All versions of Windows 7 require product activation.

Windows 7 Enterprise can only be activated with a Volume License MAK or KMS key if it is not activated against a local KMS server. Enterprise requires a VL KMS/MAK out of the box or activation against a local KMS server. It can be rearmed up to 3 times.

Windows 7 Ultimate edition activates conventionally via the internet to Microsoft activation servers.

Unless you are in a business enterprise environment, then Windows 7 Ultimate should be your choice.

@Weiming123
Just burn it into a DVD and boot from it.
Good luck.

,P4rtyP00per69,2012-07-21T07:49Z,"@Weiming123, transfer the ISO to a DVD or a USB flash drive using the Microsoft USB/DVD Download Tool (google it for the link) or use the Universal USB Installer or YUMI which can be found at pendrivelinux.com

Follow the instructions from there. After the preparation of the flash drive, boot from it (your BIOS should be set to boot from it), follow the menu and complete the installation. After installing, run the Windows Loader to activate it.

If you still cannot follow these very simple steps then you need serious help."
