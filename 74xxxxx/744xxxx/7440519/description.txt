This is my first torrent ever, so I apologize beforehand for any mistakes I might have made. 


This is the book that's available on-line for free, I just copy-pasted all of the days together into one document with LibreOffice and then converted it through http://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-epub (Awesome e book converter by the way). It works perfectly on my Nook Second Edition Touch with E-Ink and I don't think there should be any problem trying to read it with other E-Readers(Keep in mind that in the more advanced days the program listings get very long so they'll start occupying several lines, most of that can be fixed by choosing a smaller letter size). If you do find problems, however, please let me know and I'll upload the .odt document so you can convert it yourself specifically for your E-Reader.

I hope this is useful.

Keep sharing, keep caring.
