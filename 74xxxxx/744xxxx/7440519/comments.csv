,jimbuck2,2012-07-13T20:03Z,@ignaoyi good job on your first try.  You overcame what seems to be the one of the most common noob hurdles of having a file that even downloads.  I got your ebook in a few seconds. The only problem I experienced is that Mobipocket would not display the book; however it opened fine on FBReader.

But I was happy to do it because I've been downloading for so long that when I couldn't find this book on epub format, I decided it was time to start giving instead of just taking."
,ignaoyi,2012-07-15T20:51Z,I've just uploaded a revised version of the book which includes the four Appendixes at the end. Check it out!
