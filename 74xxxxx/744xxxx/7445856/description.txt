Plot: Recently married journalist Peyton MacGruder (Genie Francis) has just written her first book based on her relationship advice column “The Heart Healer.” Traveling to a scenic village in Washington State on her book tour, Peyton is surprised when her husband King (Ted McGinley) shows up with a special weekend planned at a beautiful cottage for their first anniversary. Things quickly take a turn, though, when Peyton finds a baby abandoned on her doorstep, with an anonymous note begging her to take care of the infant. As Peyton begins to do some detective work to find the baby’s mother, a down-on-her-luck and panicked young woman named Violet (Laci Mailey), she is stunned by the growing maternal instinct she feels for the small child, and must reconcile painful memories of her own child she gave up years ago. Soon, Peyton begins to question whether she will be able to give the child back, or if she can ever even forgive Violet—or herself. Can Peyton take her own heart-healing advice and help Violet, or will her own troubled past stop her?
