The Real L Word S03E01 - Apples and Oranges

In the season 3 premiere, the ladies go bicoastal as cameras capture their escapades in Los Angeles and Brooklyn.

This episode aired on July 12, 2012. Though it was recorded using analog from a non-HD broadcast, the quality is pretty good. As far as I know, this is the only release of this episode at the moment.
