,gekiganger,2012-07-16T13:43Z,"It's sad that this show that started out so good, so soon turned out to be a tedious jealousy drama. "
,dee60,2012-07-16T17:39Z,"Zip and Rar files are always suspect. In my experience never download TV shows or movies in Rar or Zip formats maybe even 7-zip.
Thanks ettv for the up you rock!
Too bad for the SPAMMER."

,funseeker521,2012-08-06T04:54Z,I definiteley disagree with gekiganger. The show is great and the characters are being developed with great skill. The writers on this show are very smart. Maybe you would prefer something a little less thought provoking - I think that there are a lot of 2 and a half men in syndication geki.
