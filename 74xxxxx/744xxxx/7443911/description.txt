  Notes:

  We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe
  Default) As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain
  Games During Rebuild.
  Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe
  Creates Is C:/Games/
  This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe.
  If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone.
  Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming.
  (So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
