,asdfkjjj,2012-07-15T16:33Z,"Thx for the up,   just know this take FOREVER to install, with 7059 audio files to decode. :-("
,extra1cake,2012-07-17T03:57Z,"XD 7-zip compresses the uncompressed version of this to 1.4GB. And uncompressing that only takes a few minutes. KaOs needs to optimize their code a bit if they don't want people to consider them noobs. Still, good upload thanks gansuk."
,ab590,2012-07-19T07:03Z,"um ive run the unpack.bat and all it does is produce empty folders, no exe, nothing? have i missed something? :("
,ab590,2012-07-19T07:06Z,"id really appreciate if someone could help me out, n explain where ive gone wrong :( thanku..xx"
,zalayer,2012-07-30T20:37Z,how do you un install it ?
,ffhighwind,2012-08-09T15:29Z,"Game works fine. No trojan detected from AVG.

Run Install.exe and pick a directory, then wait 2 hours for it to extract. 2 HOURS??? Yeah, that long. Don't believe me?

It will say installation complete when it's done. At one point it seemed to pause, but it was still working."
,Atomsk1,2012-08-11T09:12Z,"Whats the point of compression if it ends up taking longer to unpack than it would to download the uncompressed files?

Do these people not realize we have broadband internet now?"
,BakaBaka11,2012-08-12T21:24Z,I bet KaOs krew use flamethrowers when they cook food.........
[V],gansuk,2012-08-13T10:38Z,"not everybody has a nice connection, thats the whole point of these releases, if you want the uncompressed files go and download them rather than comment complaining here, the discription tells you a rough idea how long its going to take you to insall."
,ag_orange,2012-08-23T15:14Z,Well done Ganusk....another great torrent! And excellent game...
