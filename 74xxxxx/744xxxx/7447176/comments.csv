,simon200,2012-07-16T01:20Z,Cheers for the up kids will be delighted 
,flamesong,2012-07-16T01:58Z,"Genre: Comedy?

I just looked at the screenshots and nothing resembles any part of the book upon which this is supposed to be based. I don't remember any kids in it or any people at all come to that.

As far as I remember, The Lorax is a cautionary tale of possible environmental catastrophe caused by greed and stupidity. I suppose there is some dark humour there if you are a Bill Hicks or George Carlin.

I'll give it a watch but I'm dreading it and I bet Ted Geisel is rolling in his grave."
,simon200,2012-07-16T02:08Z,A10 V 10 Cheers again

,Jayy232,2012-07-16T19:33Z,"It's working now, thanks!"
,MrStarz,2012-07-16T21:59Z,update --- there is a very loud hissing sound at the end of the film that lasts for like 7 mins when they are talking / singing 
,whocares2012xabc,2012-07-17T03:42Z,The Audio at the end of the movie is AWFUL. Have to find a better rip. 
,zanik99,2012-07-17T04:29Z,"Hate useless adverts.
Yeah Audio is scratch at the end.
A:8 V:10."
,Kinectd,2012-07-17T13:16Z,"Yes, I agree with the above posters. There is a horrible scratching sound at the end when there is talking/singing. It also happens a few times throughout the movie but those only last a few seconds so it's no big deal.

Other than that, great movie!

V:9
A:9 (for the times when it wasn't hissing/scratchy)"

,turntechGodhead,2012-07-17T18:44Z,"Fuck this shit, that hissing ruined the movie"

,K2Smoka,2012-07-18T04:53Z,So if this is a DVDrip why are the files AVI and i have to convert them to burn them to DVD so fucking aggravating. ive been torrenting but just got into movies im a gamer and app guy so wtf is going on
,19dragonz,2012-07-18T05:26Z,"720x384 ?

,montyboy21,2012-07-18T05:31Z,is there a way to bypass cinavia message code 1
,BlackandBad,2012-07-18T19:23Z,cinivia should only exist if it's bluray rips
,lizard36,2012-07-18T21:38Z,"Just a heads up everyone, this movie is not being released onto dvd until August 7,2012"
,YellowBeard89,2012-07-18T22:44Z,***WARNING*** this movie is EXTREMELY PREACHY....there absolutely is an agenda being told in the story - which takes away from the fun that it could have been...you have been warned.
,1-1-11,2012-07-18T23:30Z,"The movie was great until you get 1:13:00 then the audio go's to shit!
I tried three different media player's and all have the same result.
VLC
MPC
Winamp
For those that are wondering what I am talking about when you get to the time I posted every time someone speaks it gets staticy!
Thank you uploader for trying    "
,_MiracleGrow_,2012-07-19T00:24Z,"@K2SMOKA - break down dvdrip.. what does that mean? ripped from dvd, so it's a smaller size. If your looking for full dvds, look in the movies dvdr section"
,3danim,2012-07-19T06:37Z,This is Gr8! A/V - 10 with respect to DVD Q. Thanks.

,erllab,2012-07-19T22:40Z,"Nice video :) I alway use VLC to play the AVI file.

Thanks for the upload!"
,lubbydub,2012-07-20T02:25Z,"Yellowbeard89 is a republican but i digress.

Good movie, good message, little to much singing. 

The rip is good until the end where there is some loud static that kinda suck but its during one of the song so not to interfering.
v9
a9 for 99% of movie"
,ironymon,2012-07-20T08:15Z,"Preachy, not sure wtf that means.. won't watch then."
,YellowBeard89,2012-07-21T02:06Z,"No, I'm an Independent, but that doesn't change the fact what the message has always been in this particular Suess story - the redneck idiots etc. - all democratic crap...for the record I was not a fan of GW"
,bedan,2012-07-21T04:43Z,"@K2Smoka 
Who burns movies these days?
Your a gamer and dont know how to make use of a computer?

Im fine with .avi or any other format(Im a gamer for real) and if i stumble on to something I dont know how to use I google it, not bitch like a little...well...a bitch =)

THX for upload! =)"
,endisneigh,2012-07-21T05:36Z,"This movie isn't preachy...this is preachy:
Every current Republican is either evil, or stupid (yes, or both). You cannot support the present line-up of malevolent retards they're offering up (Bachman, Rand Paul, all of 'em) without being either malicious or retarded. Period.

Every good ol' boy, tea-partying, ""take our country back"", card carrying member of the Right ought to be held underwater until the bubbles stop."

The theme of the movie is nice!!"
,orangeyish,2012-07-21T21:26Z,"YellowBeard89; there is an agenda in the book, too. It's called, ""Don't kill the trees 'cuz, like, we need them to live, and stuff."""
,orangeyish,2012-07-21T21:48Z,"After watching the intro song, I will say that their accuracy in depicting the typical American suburb  is only marred by the fact that people in suburbs rarely start singing spontaneously. Not in my experience, anyhow. "

,andy1509,2012-07-22T14:44Z,great movie
,MyKrossini,2012-07-22T22:46Z,@ K2Smoka: Pretty much all the early release movie files will come in .avi simply because it's smaller and easier to work with. If you want an actual dvd rip you will need to pay attention to the size of the file. Real dvd rips will be about 4.3GB. They have better quality and there's no converting time to burn them but your download time will most likely make up for and go beyond the time it would take you to download a smaller 0.7GB - 1.8GB .avi file and convert it and burn it lol. So my recommendation is stick with the smaller .avi files and use the program convertxtodvd to burn them. Simple and quick. I hope this helps and makes your experience with downloading movies more enjoyable and less confusing.
,YellowBeard89,2012-07-23T04:05Z,"@endisneigh - you represent your party very well. I would love to know how to become one of ""you guys"" as you share such a great warmth towards your fellow man. Anyway - this movie was awesome! Go out and buy it instead of getting it for free here ya bunch of freeloaders!"
,IHAVEBIPOLAR,2012-07-23T12:20Z,Meh.. I signed some form awhile back from Tim and Eric that stated I pledged not to see this movie... oh well looks gay anyways. 
,foreignadaption,2012-07-24T11:52Z,"@YellowBeard89 

Are you freaking kidding me? Too preachy/agenda, you mean teaching our next generation how we cut down the trees is an agenda. God you people are f'ing ignorant. The trees are what cleans our air, once that's gone so are we. "
,foreignadaption,2012-07-24T11:58Z,"@YellowBeard89

Freeloaders? You must have never been taught to share, no wonder you're such a dick. "
,coleTech,2012-07-25T04:24Z,"The fact is the Lorax movie has the same message as the book which was always my favorite Dr. Seuss book as a child. Needing trees IS NOT an agenda as much as it is a message, and that message is even more relevant today than it ever has been."
,RedoName,2012-07-25T22:35Z,Thank you!

,I-hate-lol-cats,2012-07-29T06:45Z,Why is this listed as DVD rip when it's clearly not?

,Eiznek,2012-08-02T15:57Z,"You know for being the ""good party"" democrats, you sure are extremely intolerant and general in your accusations. I'm republican with a few liberal ideals, but I don't go around saying all democrats are evil or ignorant. Harsh to be so judgmental when you don't know all of us and how we think. 

On a side note: How did you manage to put politics into the most unpolitical site on the web? We're all Pirates or you wouldn't be uploading or downloading, so let's just let the conservative or liberal views be nonexistent. ^_^
