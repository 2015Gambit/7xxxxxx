Vuze is one of the clients I use

After you get it on Vuze go to you Pirate Bay Acc and at the bottom of the page click on ""upload Torrent"" just fill in the required fields.

The first line,where it says ""Torrent"" browse for torrent file created by Vuze.It will look like the Vuze Icon.That is what you upload to TPB

Keep the book your uploading and the torrent file in the same folder

Let me know if you have any questions"

                 thankyou"
