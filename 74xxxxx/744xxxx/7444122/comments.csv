[T],Auge,2012-07-14T23:45Z,"I considered for a long while not to post this, let me try telling you why:
I am not just a collector nor am I just a film fan . . . I am obsessed by film and film history and I have only met a handful of people with this obsession.
This version of Rebecca has been one of those Holy Grail items, everybody wants it yet nobody has it. I have spent years looking for these discs and have just recently found them, I did not just click a button and download it like you are about to do; instead I have been calling and visiting rental stores, scouring public library collections and so forth. I finally found it and had to plop down a $200 deposit just to borrow it.
A voice in my head (and a couple other of those film obsessed friends I mentioned above) have been telling me that nobody else has put in the work to hunt down this very rare item . . . but in the end that idea goes against my philosophy of pirating.
So I offer this to you with the hope that before you click that download button that you realize what went into this torrent being readily provided for you. And if you appreciate what went into me providing this for you, please let me know by posting a little something below."

I have also included eBooks extras in this post.

for some reason it lost my entire written description above."
,russell1nash,2012-07-15T01:53Z,"this OOP Criterion is, without a doubt, a magnificent upload!
and even though it is not my favorite among the films i've dload from u, Auge (since i was always kinda standoffish re Hitch  - - - again, i'm being subjective... :) ) - this is one of the unmissables for any true film aficionado! back in the day, i dloaded this froma private tracker and put the dvdshirnk upon it... I was young and foolish. thanx for giving me the chance to rectify that! 
U, my friend, rock! 
Thanx and i really hope a lotta ppl will dload this and convey their thoughts on your work and this movie!   "

You are on of them that always posts a little something."
,Waikiki2008,2012-07-15T03:39Z,"After your description of all the trials, tribulations, and expense you went through to obtain this version Rebecca, I can fully understand your reluctance to share this as just a torrent. I suspect most Hitchcock collectors have this film in one form or another, but it was always this unattainable version that always had the hook in me personally. A simple thanks for sharing this rare item seems laughably inadequate but many thanks Auge for sharing this, and so many other great films that few of us could either obtain or afford."
,talbot10,2012-07-15T05:37Z,Thanks Auge for this fine movie in DVD9. I especially liked this film for the interplay between Joan Fontaine & Judith Anderson the latter of which played a great heavy.
[T],Auge,2012-07-15T07:02Z,"Thanks guys (ignore the assumption about gender),
I knew I could count the three of you and a couple others to chime in here.

I am not even really looking for a “thank you” here, I would be happy with just a “Holy shit, I am taking this ! ! !” . . . lol.

On March 26 I uploaded Stagecoach a two disc Criterion set, I am unable to determine how many folks at TPB downloaded it but I do know that so far 382 completions have happened over at Demonoid, and I believe that TBP has more users so it’s a safe assumption the number is larger than Demonoids . . . With only a total of 11 comments between both places.

I am just being a little cry-baby-bitch (my wife’s words) about this and I will always upload at least a little something just to keep my ratio decent at Demonoid.  . . Which brings to mind something else I have been thinking about; I no longer download anything from TPB so I post here for the handful of folks that seem to appreciate it, I know exactly how hard it is to find not only certain version of films but to find a full DVD of them."
,dandeak,2012-07-15T07:49Z,Thanks very much for the movie. I have downloaded a few of your torrents. They are indeed very rare and they show your vast knowledge in cinema history. I truly appreciate your efforts. Thank you very much.
,baybeh,2012-07-15T09:07Z,"Dear dear Auge! 
Let me just say this: We don't know each other, we don't even know each other's names, but know what, you are one of my favorite people alive! I live  on a completely different part of the planet as you, and would not have access to these gems or even the HOPE of getting access to anything of that sort, and you are helping SO MUCH in my education as a filmmaker. Your collection is a film school in itself, and i'm getting into cliche territory here, but words cannot express how grateful I am, for the films, the ebooks, everything! I think you already know I'm a huge fan of yours! :)"
,baybeh,2012-07-15T09:13Z,"Also, I haven't been able to download Stagecoach as yet, so my comment on that page is still pending. I already know I'm gonna be ecstatic though, so you have a clue of what's gonna get posted. :D"
,serena101,2012-07-15T10:23Z,"dear auge:

do you happen to upload tv series? i mean retro tv shows like the twilight zone? something like that. or other film noirs? "
[T],insinuendo,2012-07-15T11:39Z,"Yup, this is a gem! One of my favorite hitchcock films. Though I'm not going to download it, I still want to show my appreciation as well, for this, and for all of the other great films you have gone through the trouble of making openly accessible to all. 

I personally own the MGM blu-ray which imo is superior except for the extras perhaps. I would be nice to see criterion to a HD re-release.

Cheers!"
[T],Auge,2012-07-16T02:39Z,"I still have another 4 binders to go through and at least 12 new discs a month; to rip to ISO . . . ah well; it’s a labor of love. 

Oh, and I am expecting a 1 terabyte hard drive of stuff from a buddy I met here at TPB.
So I will have plenty of good stuff to put up . . . not including the stuff I already ripped but haven’t posted (8 binders worth). "
[T],Auge,2012-07-16T05:56Z,"You see, this is what I wanted to hear.

I knew that a lot of people wanted what I posted, but it means more to me that for some of you these films are unavailable and that I am actually helping film lovers out . . . not just providing someone with a grab and go film that they think no more about than getting a burger from the drive through . . . if that analogy works.

It never occurred to me that people in other nations would not be able to get these DVDs, a couple of you have pointed that out and this makes me feel good."
,serena101,2012-07-16T17:13Z,"dear auge

do you happen to have ""All Through The Night"" - starring humphrey bogart on your movie list? "
,El_Hanko,2012-07-16T21:58Z,"""It never occurred to me that people in other nations would not be able to get these DVDs, a couple of you have pointed that out and this makes me feel good."" 
Yes, unfortunately I'm in that situation too; also I'm a college student so I can't afford the price to buy and import the movies you upload (by the way, I don't think that will change once I graduate since I'm a Philosophy student :D). Personally, I prefer DVD5 since I don't see much of a difference between that and DVD9 (keep in mind that I only rip my music CDs to FLAC, so I think I do pay some attention to quality), and DVD9s are way more expensive, at least where I live. 
I only discovered your torrents yesterday and I'm already downloading a bunch of them :D and of course, I will seed the crap out of this! :D 

¡MUCHAS GRACIAS, Auge!."
,nmsn,2012-08-12T10:40Z,"HI, I am from Taiwan (a.k.a republic of china), and it is really hard to find criterion collection dvd here(except from college library). And I think most of them are region 1 dvd (the standard dvd player here plays region 3 dvd...the whole region code stuff  is really a stupid design in my opinion..) . Needless to say, when I found out Mr. Auge your astonishing criterion collection uploads, how surprised and joyful I was. Literally your efforts have broadened my movie experience and knowledge. (well the only problem is that I might have to buy a larger hard drive :P) Thank you so much! Please keeps up the good works!
