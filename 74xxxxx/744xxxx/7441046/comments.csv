,TunaHead,2012-07-14T11:46Z,Thank you so much.
,hisazul,2012-07-14T13:50Z,"since im sure some wont figure out how to install with given instructions ill give some extra help.
1. install as trial version.
2. dont install any toolbars offered nor agree to share statistics(thats just extra useless crap installed on your system)
3. once you have installed dt as trial reboot. needed if you installed sptd. its a good idea to install it.
4. run patch.exe as administrator. make sure dt is actually already running as service. otherwise patcher wont find installation."
,hisazul,2012-07-14T13:52Z,"oh yeah... almost forgot.
5. once it successfully patched open dt click help>license>validate. type anything with letters and numbers. 123abc or what not. once it accepts dt will switch to advanced version and you are set."
,barracudy,2012-07-15T16:13Z,Well good explanations except for the fact that the crack folder is empty!
,sixzeronine,2012-07-15T17:57Z,"Crack folder wasnt empty for me, although, when I click the ""validate"" button... nothing happens"
,fcfs,2012-07-18T18:35Z,"Tem virus neste torrent. Cuidado!

,kurdapyo777,2012-07-20T19:22Z,"works perfectly! brilliant!  easy instructions.. thanks a lot mate!

,WindyBreezy,2012-07-27T23:05Z,Thank you for the dl and tyvm for clearing up the installation process.
,carrigart140,2012-07-30T15:39Z,many thanks
,PhydeauxS,2012-07-30T18:02Z,"Empty crack folder here, too."
,Nextsky,2012-07-31T11:51Z,Contain virus. Folder is empty because antivirus delete the content.
,ckoijun,2012-08-07T10:34Z,Thank you !!
,ckoijun,2012-08-07T10:35Z,It does not contain any virus.. your antivirus detected it bcuz its a patch. Turn off your antivirus when you're downloading and installing it.
,jsoechumbo,2012-08-08T01:22Z,I click on validate and it does nothing. Anyone have the same problem?
,tedwu,2012-08-10T10:53Z,"I came back to report the bad news. It would seem a month later after hisazul post patch does not work anymore. Strange being the same version.
Tried:
Install three times fresh.
Applied patch while running the program as suggested. Patch say Yes but Validate had no response. (I even put in a user name)
Both install as trial advanced and trial as standard failed.
I wanted it to work believe me. Anyone figure it out how. (safe mode maybe) Please proof me wrong, and share how you got it working if you did. Many thanks."
,seere666,2012-08-11T15:33Z,"some are saying the patch didn't work. here's how i got it to work.

1: install daemon tools as TRIAL (reboot if necessary)

2: launch patcher (i ran it as admin winxp sp2 compatibility on win7)

3: launch daemon tools 

4: click ""help"" then ""license""

5: click ""change""

6: entered a random serial

voila validated!"
,tedwu,2012-08-13T12:18Z,"I feel the urge that I must come back a second time. This time with grim news.
Dont NOT DOWNLOAD Virus    want detail read on...you are warned 
I have install as seere666 suggested. I runed it as winxp sp2 compatibility on win7. Norton 360 first delete my patch so I figure just another false + from AV espcially Norton. After patch states okay Norton again interfered (normal) Think again patch has incorporated windows warning stating ""brd.dll missing What did you do!"" Sure enough restore is avaliable from Norton. I let brd go back to Daemon install folder. Nightmare begins infection took over boot. Im doing windows restore as Im posting this if not reformat again for third time little did I know it was this patch that had the evil deed. I pray Kernal did not get infected. Black hats that distroy ave. users PCs are not even worth menitoning thier name. You wanna prove yourself hack the government. No only will I repect your ability and other advanced computer users; fellow hackers will too.
Please dont blame scene4all it's not easy to earn a skull. This person likely only seeded and upload for us that's all. He/she will likely not aware patch is a set trap.
NOTE: Every once in a while black hat enters acting if they are gray hat to distroy our community. Judge virus warning yourselves as you gain experience you will begin to understand what's false what's not. New things do come up Im still learner myself. Have back up computer/drive (this I assume you know). Lastly the moment you notice something fishy pull your internet plug first (undefeatable firewall) then I'll do force shut down. Kills hard drive life but you wont want any unwanted windows autosafe. 
Thanks for attention and hope you will better awared from this information.
Happy hunting for your needs:)"

,pattyo41,2012-08-26T17:22Z,"Hi folks, i installed the program but i keep getting a pop up box stating,
BRD.dll is missing what the hell are u doing, 
I am doing something wrong, any suggestions thanks,"
,BobsYourUncleN8,2012-08-27T09:56Z,"BEWARE!!!!  
Norton 360 removed virus file ""patch.exe"" aka, ""Trojen.Gen.2"". 
Unless there is a good reason for a virus hidden in the patch file?? Anyone? Anyone? Fry?"
,BobsYourUncleN8,2012-08-28T12:35Z,"BRD cracked, supplied and packaged this.... other peeps have stated after install an error msg says ""BRD.DLL is missing what are you doing?""  BRD=Black Rider D_____ ???? Just an observation."
,sweetfighter,2012-08-30T17:44Z,Great work- much thanks!!!!!!!
,captkong,2012-09-11T02:28Z,"Guess I won't be trying this out. If your AV software finds a virus, that's normal, so long as it's recognized as a patch/keygen/crack. But if it detects a trojan or some other nasty stuff, that is not good. Stop and delete it. 

Thanks for the heads-up, fellas."
