PROPER justification of IMMERSE's release as per rules is overcrop on the bottom by 2 pixels. Personal justification is poor settings/filter usage resulting in noticeable jaggedness, especially on movement. Included are 3 comparison screenshots; 1 & 2 are direct ORENJI - IMMERSE encode comparison as labeled, while 3 is ORENJI - IMMERSE - SOURCE comparison. This isn't personal, just want high quality releases all around.
