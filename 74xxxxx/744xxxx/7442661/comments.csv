,Brat001,2012-07-14T20:10Z,thieves are complaining of theft? that's ironic lol just download and quit your whining.
,TickTockTickTock,2012-08-28T19:54Z,"it's got nothing to do with theft, it's a matter of trust. i trust YIFY and their torrents. they put up the DVD cover and a summary of the film, as well as technical info. this is just lazy and stupid. would you buy a ferarri that was just a ford with a ferarri logo on it? NOPE!"
