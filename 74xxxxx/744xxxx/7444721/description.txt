DESCRIPTION:

Developments in nanoscience, biotechnology and photonics are on the verge of offering great opportunities for the exploration of optical interactions at the nanoscale. Today, there is an ever-increasing need for optical imaging tools that are able to resolve features at the length-scales relevant for biological cells, molecules, and complexes, as well as for the rapidly developing class of materials known as nanostructures.
