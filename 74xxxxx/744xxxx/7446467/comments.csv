,skoxpress,2012-08-27T06:42Z,"You don't really need the license.
Find your ""Models"" file. Mine was D/users/myname/My Documents/VideoCopilot/
and load the files there.
The models show up in the ""Model Browser"" and from the ""Edit"" column double click on ""none set"" and get the material by clicking down arrow and ""Load from File.."""
