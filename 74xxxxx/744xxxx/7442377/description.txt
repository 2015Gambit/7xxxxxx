A duet performance between pianist Marilyn Crispell and clarinetist David
Rothenberg offers nebulous mystery and thematic, ECM-style theatrical contexts
you should expect from longtime veterans of creative improvised music. The
liquid piano sound of Crispell and the pithy, earthy, throat tones of
Rothenberg's bass clarinet in the main shapeshift back and forth during this
mercurial program of deep blue, darkest night, after-hours modern jazz. It's
not so much programmed as it states anchors of melody and centerpieces of
coalesced thought process, rambles into free discourse, then returns to an
identity. Fans of Crispell will note her evolving presence as a force for stark
beauty during wandering but far from lost tracks such as "Tsering," or "Snow
Suddenly Stopping Without Notice," also employing the inside strings of the
piano, and using percussion instruments including bells. Rothenberg's expertise
as an accompanist for Crispell is never more telling through all the material,
but as a spontaneous improviser he's really in his element during "The Hawk &
The Mouse," and especially a comical "Still Life with Woodpeckers" alongside
Crispell's playful percussive rat-a-tat-tat. As intriguing as it is deep,
spiritual, and compelling, these two have chemistry bubbling under the surface,
with the kind of geothermic energy available to slightly warm up any living
space, vacant or not.
