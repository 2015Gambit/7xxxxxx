Does this work with update 1.3 and other dlcs like From Ashes & Extended Cut?"
,Fantomnz,2012-07-16T00:02Z,"Hi everyone.

@Machine4578  Thanks for the info as have wondered for quite some time what the robot dog BS was all about as havnt read anything in comments on other torrents about it. Cheers.

@vikrant_bhave  Yes this does work with update 1.3 and other dlcs like From Ashes & Extended Cut. Iv completed ME3 half a dozen times now & this has work for me. Iv also & can recommend the 100% readiness Cheat!! Cheers"
,vikrant_bhave,2012-07-17T23:52Z,"Thanks a ton,Fantomnz..
What is the 100% readiness cheat? Sorry for being a noob on this one.. i have yet to finish ME2 and haven't installed ME3...
Thank you,Machine4578 for sharing the info with us.
Will definitely seed.. "
,Fantomnz,2012-07-18T01:25Z,"@vikrant_bhave Your welcome.
The 100% cheat upgrades the War Asset precentage from the standard 50% which is all you can get in single player mode (You'll see what I mean when you get into ME3) other wise you have to player multi player online.
Go here & read the comment section & it will explain everything :)
