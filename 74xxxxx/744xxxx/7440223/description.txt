In preparation for their hugely anticipated headline performance at this year's Download
Festival, Black Sabbath announced an intimate homecoming show at O2 Academy Birmingham.
This was also a charity fund raiser for "Help For Heroes". The venue was packed with a sold
out 3000 capacity crowd.

This was Black Sabbath's first performance in their hometown for 11 years ΓÇö and their first
concert since 2005. We had three-quarters of the legendary original lineup. Tommy Clufetos,
a member of Ozzy's solo band, is filling in for Bill Ward, who is sitting out the group's
reunion shows due to contractual disputes with his bandmates.

Tony looked well after his recent diagnosis with lymphoma - Ozzy proclaimed him "the Iron
Man!"

Please do not sell this recording but share freely and enjoy it!

For the 3009 who turned up!
