Live set by The JuJu Beans at O'Riley's in Dallas, Tx. 01/19/2010

About the JuJu Beans :

The JuJu Beans play everything from rockin' rhythm & blues to hardcore old style country, from greasy barroom boogie to authentic juke joint blues, from Sun era rockabilly to traditional rock 'n roll, all with a garage type purity and intensity that brings to mind the beginnings of all these types of music. With The JuJu Beans, attitude is the key. That attitude transforms itself into totally unpretentious, thoroughly energizing, immensely satisfying recordings and shows that will keep you dancin' til dawn. So, if you like rockin' rhythm & blues played like it was in the 50's and early 60's, with no compromise, then you'll love The JuJu Beans.
