Setup:
-HP G72-250US
-Intel Core i3 M350 2.27GHz
-8Gb PC3-10700 RAM
-Win7 64-bit SP1
-SB X-Fi Surround 5.1

Process:
-16-bit/44.1kHz files ripped from the CD and joined in Wavelab 6
-DC offset removed, this will yield a file with a bit depth of 18-24 bits
-Resample to 384kHz in Wavelab w/crystal resampler ultra(slow) relax background priority
-Create new 64-bit/384kHz master recording in Wavelab (0db gain)

As reported in Wavelab:
-Original 16/44 - Apparent Bit Resolution = 16, Peak = 0db
-DC Offset Removed - Apparent Bit Resolution = 18, Peak = 0db
-Final Recording - Apparent Bit Resolution = 42, Peak = 4.703db

-Resample 64/384 to 64/44.1 in Wavelab w/crystal resampler, ultra(slow) relax background priority
-Apply loudness maximizer (0.2db) and MBIT+ 16-bit Dither (Noise Shaping - Light, Dither Amount - High, Auto-blanking - on) in Wavelab w/Izotope Ozone 4 VST Plugin
-Flac encode level 0 with Trader's Little Helper
-Tag and pic with xrecode II

No DSD this time around, peaks levels of 4.7db on the second disc prevented me from doing that without ruining the sound quality. Still damn good even w/out the DSD conversion.
