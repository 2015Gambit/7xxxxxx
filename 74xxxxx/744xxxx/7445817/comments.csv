,kentcave,2012-07-16T04:17Z,"haha Wu Qing played by Liu Yi Fei..nice marketing..but I guess the love story between the two hidden-weapons masters wont be in this adaptation? 

Oh well..cant wait to watch it. Must highly recommend this SUPER-SMART detective wu-xia flick. Almost like Sherlock-Holmes in classical imperial chinese era. T.O.Pâ"

For future reference, the solution is to not include URL spam in your torrents."
,kentcave,2012-07-18T09:32Z,"Annoying ads for the china pirate's site..blocking the sub and destroying the mood in some part. Other than that, no complain for the quality of the movie.

As for the story..not enough depth, for those that follows the written saga. Only showing off the effects and actors.

The Four are supposed to be cool. Here only Two are cool for me..Wu Qing is deliciously icy and Cui Ming emulate his humorous streak. While Tie Shou has too few screen-time and Leng Xue gotten too much, cause of the famous actor. Sigh..

Cant wait for the sequel against Tang sect. But guess this wont be block-buster enough to guarantee that. Sigh.."
