Transformers Prime - Season 2 - Episodes 1 to 3
-----------------------------------------------

Team Prime lives on Earth as a pre-emptive measure against the return of the
Decepticons. Autobot Central Command is located in a converted missile silo
in Nevada which was provided by the United States government, with whom the
Autobots have formed an alliance. However, the presence of Transformers on
Earth is not generally known among the civilian population. The Autobots have
taken three human teens under their protection after their association with
the Autobots put them in danger from the Decepticons.

Following the events of the season 1 finale, Optimus Prime has lost all memory
of ever being a Prime after using the Matrix of Leadership to send Unicron back
into stasis; his memory has been reset to when he was still the data clerk
Orion Pax. Megatron takes advantage of this, telling "Orion" that the Autobots
are evil, taking him onto the Nemesis and setting him to work on a project
deciphering Autobot inscriptions from the Iacon records.
