used KiNGDOM video and CM8 line audio  - thanks a lot!! :)
Added about 16 sec to beginning to include full audio,
cut up, rotated, resized, sharpen, cropped, adjust a/r, etc.
One little bit of movement for a sec or two in first minute and 
a half, after opening credits is all good. Audio sounds great
and synced up nice thx to CM8's work.
Avoid the fakes, get verified torrents from SUMOTorrent.com
and other great sites. Make Peace and Honor the Earth! 
Share everything! Hope u all enjoy this very funny movie!
