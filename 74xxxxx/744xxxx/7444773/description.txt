Kokoro Connect - Episode 02


The five members of the Cultural Study group that meets in class 401 have spent a lot of time wondering what it would be like to be in someone else's shoes. But they're about to learn that there's a huge difference between thinking about something and literally BEING in someone else's shoes! Because that's exactly what happens when, suddenly and inexplicably, they each find themselves inside the body of the girl (or boy) next door! 

What happens next? Well, besides bringing a whole new meaning to the term "Exchange Student" and the expected freaked out runs to the bathroom, it's not hard to do the math: Take one wrestling geek, the resident cool girl, the class clown, the popular chick and one sultry maid of mystery, scramble thoroughly and divide, and you can bet that pretty soon they'll be answering ALL of the questions they never wanted to know about the opposite sex in ways they never anticipated!
