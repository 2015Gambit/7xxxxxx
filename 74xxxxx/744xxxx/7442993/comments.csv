Enjoy!  :)"

,JiLoa,2012-07-18T00:20Z,"Hi, sorry I dont know how to contact you, I want to know if you help me, I uploaded music and want to spread it to others, I dont care about me, its about giving God the love that He should get. The music puts you so close to God, you just cant help to want to live for Him :)  And I have downloaded your music over a year ago and everyday I listen to it and seed when I can. Thanks for your great work for God"
,JiLoa,2012-07-18T00:32Z,"Oh and 1 more thing, God bless you abundantly
@f20c13 - God loves you hehe. When the 2 of you stand before God what do you think would happen? I'd steal and spread God's love to everyone I meet and if God wants to condemn me for it, I'll take the punishment, so long as that while I was alive I could share Gods love and encourage people that there is a way and that everything will be ok.  remember the parable about the fruit and its branches? the branches that dont produce will be cut off and replaced by ingrafted ones ;)"
,clardx1,2012-07-22T05:43Z,Thank you for the download. Can you please post Marvin Winans - The Praise and Worship Experience and Amber Bullock - So In Love and Thank you. Elder Goldwire McClendon - the Best of Elder Goldwire McClendon.
