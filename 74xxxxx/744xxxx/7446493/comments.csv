,cryotekk,2012-07-22T22:00Z,"Dunno, this keeps crashing to desktop on me. "
,FEarBG,2012-07-23T09:36Z,"@cryotekk Look like you need to reinstall you java. Try with Java Version 7 Update 5 x86 (32bit edition). The current launcher in this torrent runs on 32 bit java version but I already have a new one who use x64 java and it will be placed in the next torrent (V2).

Also you may not have enough RAM. Use ""-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M"" or ""-Xmx2048M -Xms2048M"" depending on how much RAM you want to allow the game to use.

And finally but not least : Install CleanMem 2.4.2. It will automatically release free memory."
,dark87,2012-07-24T01:22Z,Lacks on mine. i using a AMD Turicon X2  with Windows s 7 32-bit?
,FEarBG,2012-07-24T02:00Z,"Everyone can use the new V2 now - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7469173

Support both x32 and x64 java with OptiFine mod for FPS Boost and game performance optimization. Also have new GLSL Shader mod who improve graphics. 

""TooManyItems"" is replaced by ""NotEnoughItems"" which is better. 

Đ?nd again finally but not least - MAtmos R12 for additional sound effects in game.."

You need to register on this server. Otherwise everyone will be able to log in with your name and use your items.

Just type ""/register password password"" in the chat. Example : /register 12345 12345

Every ""Bukkit"" server use this. I guess you never play on such before.."
,FEarBG,2012-08-21T18:57Z,"Recently I started getting a few comments under my videos about problems with mods and my torrents in general.

Since YouTube is not the most appropriate site for such discussions, nor ThePirateBay, I made a small forum where everyone can create a thread about his problem.

Please post any problems there and leave only suggestions or simple questions as comments on ThePirateBay or YouTube.
