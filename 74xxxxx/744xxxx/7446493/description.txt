
Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods [FEarBG]


<<< Instalation >>>


Just open the "Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods [FEarBG].exe". It's "TruPortable" so you won't see any installation process. The game just start after double click and make shortcut on your desktop for the next time when you want to play it. That's it. 



<<< Important >>>

If you want to play online, change your user name. Default is "ThePirateBay".

To fly in the game, press "R" key to activate it and then use "W,A,S,D" for horizontal movements and "E and Q" for up and down movements. The "Shift" key accelerates all movements. The "Tab" key is set to open inventory but you can change that in game...
