another mixed bag of music. this one contains industrial, punk, dubstep, world music, alternative, synthpop, metal, electronica, jazz, pop, ska-punk, rhythmic noise and more. list of artists:  and one, anders ilar, anubiz, apparat, the art of noise, assemblage 23, autumn, axiome, bassnectar, beats antique, beehatch, blue stahli, bluetech, bola, cdatakill, chu ishikawa, clan of xymox, coil, david bowie, deadbeat, the death notes, depeche mode, deru, diaphane, dinosaur jr., dj hidden, dynamix ii, einst√ºrzende neubauten, eisbrecher, epica, eptic, esben and the witch, floatpoint, front 242, front line assembly, frozen rabbit, gary numan, ginormous, gwar, hecq, ill.gates, inventor, inverse phase, jello biafra with the melvins, killing joke, kmfdm, koffin kats, kone, less than jake, tori amos, white zombie, ???? and a compilation. some of these rips are mine, some are not. all mp3s, most to all are very high quality. all files have been run through mp3gain so that their volume is set by perceived loudness, not normalization. normalization is absolutely horrible. artwork is attached. the genre tags are probably debatable, but there are a million sub-genres and i'm too lazy to nitpick. they are basically tagged so that they are grouped together with songs that have similar traits and each genre can be played on random without any songs causing wtf moments. all are in directories that you can poop into itunes or your listening thingy of choice.

enjoy, and please seed.  i will be posting a lot of torrents in the future, and i'll have to start deleting old ones so that i can put new ones up.

thank you very much to the people who have been seeding my torrents.  i really appreciate it, and it makes things easier for everyone.
