Any news regarding the crack?"
,pbf11,2012-07-14T14:05Z,Can we get at least one seeder?
,almostD,2012-07-14T14:24Z,"No news about the crack.

obj files pack are coming, avoiding the registration, but you have to remake the settings for each model inside element. btw, we have time to play with it.

I actually paid for the license of Element 3D. It deserves it.

Offers on tubetape.com just this weekend.

Element 3D just 127.45 $ instead of 149."
,MEAGIM,2012-07-15T18:33Z,"i DOWNLOAD but i can't INSTALL this PACK, 
to set in SETUP SCENE , in element 3D???

answer me PLEASE.!"
,almostD,2012-07-18T14:13Z,"I thought I was clear saying NO CRACK YET.

Until we find a way to open epack files or we find the packages already in OBJ files we can't do much."
,MEAGIM,2012-07-19T22:13Z,can you all pack's convert to OBJ and update here !!
