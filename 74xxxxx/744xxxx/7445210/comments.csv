,Daddisstud,2012-09-09T20:40Z,"Subtitle problems?

#1 Download the LATEST version of Divx Player (It Is Free)

#2 Download this Torrent.

#3 Play this .Avi file USING Divx player.

#4 When playing, the Subtitles MAY NOT SHOW UP! In this Case....

#5 Right click the video area, go to Subtitles, TURN IT OFF, THEN TURN IT BACK ON (Select Track 1 - Teddy Bear.srt)

Hopefully now with the 1st Scene when he is with the Blond, they show pop up naturally! Hope that works! :)"
,Daddisstud,2012-09-09T20:41Z,Should I well... Should say :/
,Daddisstud,2012-09-09T20:59Z,"Nevermind, the Subtitle file that comes with the movie download only seems to have subtitles for the first 10 minutes.... then after that, you are on your own :("
,desss,2012-09-10T21:50Z,"Good copy a&v.
English subtitles (srt format).

Thanks."
