Volcano Live
Ever wanted to know more about volcanoes or see one erupting? Well the BBC is finding out all about them in a series of special programmes from Hawaii. The show will feature volcanoes erupting and will look at some of the most famous volcanic eruptions in history. Hawaii is made up of a string of islands formed by molten rock called magma erupting from the seabed and creating volcanoes. Professor Iain Stewart and Kate Humble will present Volcano Live from Kilauea on Hawaii, the world's most active volcano



2)  Destruction and Rebirth 
Kate Humble and Iain Stewart visit the site of the 1969 Mauna Ulu eruption in Hawaii, which covered 17 square miles of rainforest in lava. Environmental scientist Hugh Tuffen talks about his expedition to watch the Puyehue volcano in Chile erupt, and the programme also features a report on how the residents of an Icelandic island managed to save their harbour during a 1973 eruption.
