Why no season 3 or did I just miss it "

Also, not to be critical, i truly appreciate the upload. But is there an available torrent for this in a different aspect ratio? stretching out the sides to fit the screen loses some of the quality.

ok im done, sorry lol. thanks again for the upload, i love this show"

[T],bzingaz,2012-09-04T16:35Z,brother read the note in details..u can use vlc to change the aspect ration to 4:3 then it wouldn't look streched.
