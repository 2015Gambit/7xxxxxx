Description

If you like Solitaire then this is the game for you! Both Klondike 1 and Klondike 3 are included and you can move by clicking, dragging the cards, or double click to move up to top. Our natural movement system lets you play the way you like. Now with multiple backgrounds and card backs including special Christmas theme!

Taking a standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card.

The four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right corner of game) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the table piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King at the top.

Completely fill the foundations up to win the game.
