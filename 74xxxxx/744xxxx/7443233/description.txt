When Eric (Giovanni Francisco) gets dumped by his fiancee he decides to leave the city for a few days and go to a place where he can clear his head, the small town he grew up in. Dropping in on his brother Chad (Johnny Castle) and girlfriend Cindy (Bailey Blue), Eric has the opportunity to get re-acquainted with a girl he had been very good friends with in high school, the lovely Rebecca (Marie McCray). Rebecca is dealing with her own trust issues with her boyfriend Troy (Anthony Rosano) who is playing her emotions like a yo-yo. The two immediately hit it off and Eric finds himself confiding in Rebecca things he had never told anyone before. Is Rebecca the girl Eric should have always been with? Will the two broken hearts ever have room for trust again?
