This is my working revops file. It should work for you too.

Has no errors.

If it says connecting, just close black ops and open it again. If it says again, repete.

Normaly, it doesn't says connecting or it only says one time.

Play and enjoy the game :)	

I think i have in the revops file the alterops.ini with my user name and password. Open it and change to your name and password.
(dont try to log in with my name and password, i already changed my password because of that)

DONT FORGET TO SEED THE DOWNLOAD. IF YOU DONT SEED, YOU WILL PLAY ON EMPTY SERVERS.
