One thing is still bad - your upload speed. In such way i'll download it about 3 weeks or even more..."
,kuslik2000,2012-07-18T15:15Z,"Hmm ....
I have a limit of 8 megabits per second.
But I can see that downloading this torrent is slow.
Other torrents have the upload speed ten times faster.
I can not understand the problem.
Sorry for the poor quality seeding."
,kuslik2000,2012-07-18T16:00Z,"You also can tray direct dowload (and, after completion, seeding this torrent):
wget --no-passive-ftp ftp://87.249.192.119:10101/Garant.F1.7z"
