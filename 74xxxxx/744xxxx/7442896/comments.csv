but not much

[V],psspss,2012-07-15T04:12Z,"I think the best series was ufos over earth.. which followed
the guys doing an actual UFO investigation

I know syfy chan had made that series called ufo hunters
and never air them all cos of a legal battle
dont look like they will ever finish airing.. all they need to do
is change the title to ufo investigators"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-07-16T05:29Z,I agree about UFOs Over Earth. Too bad it was on for only 3 episodes.
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-20T00:00Z,"This episode wasn't to bad. Like I said before, if a UFO series is too good it will be shut down like Bill Birnes UFO Hunters. At least it ran for 3 seasons, I have them all :)"
[V],psspss,2012-07-21T11:21Z,"as usual S01E05 still hasnt shown up.. scene prob wont release it for 6 or 12 hours away

out of 125million yanks.. we have to rely of one person there with guts to release it to the web for the rest of the world to be able to watch"
