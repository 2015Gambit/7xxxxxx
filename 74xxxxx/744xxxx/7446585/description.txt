From Wiki:

The Men were an American pop rock band from Santa Monica, California. Despite its name, the group actually had two females as members. The group released a self-titled album on Polygram Records in 1992, which hit #22 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart[1] on the strength of the single "Church of Logic, Sin, and Love". The tune hit #8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart,[2] but it was their only hit, and the group disbanded soon after. Their videogot into medium rotation on MTV.[3] Jef Scott had fronted other LA area bands, most notably The Jef Scott Group, during the 80's. Lore and David also had a side project called Jimi's Kids, which sometimes featured a past and future collaborator, Ken David Paul. Ken and David had been in two other bands together, Tocan and Kill Buddha.
