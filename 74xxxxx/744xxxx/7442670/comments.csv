,tolent,2012-07-15T04:45Z,"Where do we put the license file? When I open AE 5 or 6 it just crashes when I try to open the element effect? Thank you almostd for your uploads. I'm not complaining, just trying to figure this out."
,tolent,2012-07-15T04:47Z,I installed the element.exe and it didn't ask for a license file.
,crazytorrents,2012-07-15T08:06Z,"Excellent Thank you so much! Can you do the rest of the packs like this as well,m no installer just the models!"
,-Angush,2012-07-16T05:22Z,I think the reason this isn't an installer is because its not an official model pack. 
,-Angush,2012-07-16T05:26Z,Ignore my previous comment.
