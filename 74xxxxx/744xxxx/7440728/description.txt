http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113280/

Victor is a cook who works in a greasy bar/restaurant owned by his mother, 
Dolly. It's just the two of them, a waitress named Delores, and a heavy 
drinking regular, Leo. But things change when Callie, a beautiful college 
drop-out, shows up as a new waitress and steals Victor's heart. 
But Victor is too shy to do anything about it, and too self-consciously 
overweight to dream of winning Callie away from her demanding boyfriend, 
Jeff. Victor's terrible loneliness overwhelms him when he has to face 
losing what he loves the most.
