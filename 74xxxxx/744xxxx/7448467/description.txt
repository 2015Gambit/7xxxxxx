R/C Helicopter offers just two simple modes of play: challenge and adventure. Challenge lets you unlock successively tougher levels with four trials each, and you can complete the trials in any order. The tasks begin with simple maneuvers, like landing on a small raised platform in the middle of a large empty loft. As you progress, you'll need to circle around poles, dodge or destroy balloons, shoot targets with the Apache helicopter, land on moving platforms located perilously close to the ceiling, and so forth. You'll need to beat a fixed score to pass each challenge, with the score based on time taken and the accuracy and smoothness of your landing.
