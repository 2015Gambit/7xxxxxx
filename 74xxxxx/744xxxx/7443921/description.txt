Luka Magnotta wanted attention on the internet by creating a controversial video, so he recorded himself suffocating two kitties in a bag.  Some people feel empowered by killing, so they kill animals and people needlessly.  Luka also created the snuff film "one lunatic one ice pick."  I don't support animal abuse, and I think Luka is a fool for throwing his life away for thrills and attention.  I also object to censorship, so I will never take this video down, period.
