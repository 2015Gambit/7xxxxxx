,TaylorBA,2012-07-16T17:36Z,pulicu - I can't find any about either......
,T0m1980,2012-07-16T18:43Z,Why is it still so hard to get 720p in 2012?
,oldcrank,2012-07-16T19:30Z,Usually there is a HDTV version. This is first time this show hasn't one available. Strange.
,Digitalwater,2012-07-16T19:44Z,"Argggggg, not another one in mp4 format!
Whatever happened to avi format?"
,TaylorBA,2012-07-16T20:05Z,avi is dead.

,peacetin,2012-07-18T06:33Z,I like the show.  It has a good premise behind it.  The Newsroom is the best new show out.  This episode was kind of lacking in excitement and intrigue.  Great upload and quality.  It only took about 8 minutes to download.  I'll be seeding for awhile.
,MRMKHS1,2012-08-15T09:16Z,Magic Stuff. Thank You.
