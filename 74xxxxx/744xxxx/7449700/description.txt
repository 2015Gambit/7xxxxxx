Courage the Cowardly Dog is an American animated television series created by John R. Dilworth for Cartoon Network. Its central plot revolves around a somewhat anthropomorphic dog named Courage who lives with his owners, Muriel and Eustace Bagge, an elderly, married farming couple in the "Middle of Nowhere" (the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas). Courage and his owners are frequently thrown into bizarre misadventures, often involving the paranormal/supernatural and various villains. The show is often noted for its surreal, often disquieting humor and bizarre plot twists. The series combines elements of comedy horror, science fantasy, and sometimes drama. It is rated TV-Y7.
The program originated from a short on Cartoon Network's animation showcase series created by Hanna-Barbera president Fred Seibert, "What A Cartoon!" titled "The Chicken from Outer Space".[1]
On April 20, 2012, this series returned to Cartoon Network in re-runs on the revived block, "Cartoon Planet".[2]
