,tyemall,2012-07-16T05:45Z,"If everyone will seed this, Everyone will get it faster. that's how it works. Also note, Uploading does not slow down your download speed. Upload at maximum rate. If your using u-torrent, It allows you to download faster while uploading because your sharing. "

,sahilrox,2012-07-16T17:10Z,"Here is a different comment actually about the PPV. Good PPV. Comes after Wrestlemania and No Way Out this year. Best Matches - World Championship match, WWE Championship Match, RAW MITB Match, SD MITB Match. Thats the order according to awesomeness. Awesome physical battles. 7.8/10 PS - No Spoilers please. As far as the quality goes, i had no problems on vlc player. Thats how you actually comment on the PPV."
,KKKDownlow,2012-07-16T17:18Z,Guess that everyone just watched the PPV and then deleted it and refused to seed for everyone else. I'm getting a cool 1.7kB/s. Thanks a lot guys.
,Discolight,2012-07-16T18:19Z,what is for shit that coming up in the video? -.-
,dididie,2012-07-16T18:31Z,"Garbage.  Thanks for uploading but next time try more than this blurred crap.  I haven't seen pixels like this since nintendo.  How come no one just rips a real fucking 720 or 1080 of these?  Should be THIS size if they did it, maybe 2 gb tops.  In stead they say ""hdtv"" and put out this shit that should only be about half a gig with this quality (sound is garbage too.  Has that filtered sound when they force it to a very low bitrate).  This is the first PPV rip I can't watch because the quality sucks too much>  Going to just buy them from now on.  Unfucking believable.  I don't even upload and rip better than this."
,bluestinger90,2012-07-16T19:15Z,Upload is garbage. Video skips and doesn't play back properly. 
,bluestinger90,2012-07-16T19:16Z,Go with RUDOS release.
,bluestinger90,2012-07-16T19:17Z,Garbage. Video doesn't play back reliably. Go with the Rudos release instead.
,dididie,2012-07-16T19:34Z,"Someone should break this mother fucker's thumbs for pressing ""info"".  What a fucking cunt burger."
,thuzithanwn,2012-07-16T20:00Z,fucking fuck......wtf scene4all...?? u r a vip pirate here...plz mean it...do not upload crap n bullshit like thz....do NOT get thz copy....fucking fucking fuck
,l337m4n,2012-07-16T20:16Z,"It freezes for about 5 seconds every 30secs - 1 minute or so, horrible."
,Rimmer7,2012-07-17T03:06Z,Why the fuck does this piece of shit torrent have so many seeds?
,cbc9797,2012-07-17T05:59Z,"Thanks for putting this up so fast. Meant to comment yesterday but this torrent is good. It freezes for the first 5-10 mins but he does something like changes the channel and it works fine after that. Nothing is missed because of the freezing and it all happens before the very first match. This was the first torrent for Money in the Bank and again, thank you for getting this here so quickly! Much appreciated."
,Kilmanas,2012-07-17T15:06Z,Fcking laggy video man...
,arjay45,2012-07-18T03:08Z,"I grew up thanking people for things they give me for free. So Thanks scene4all. 

It's not his fault the video stops every few seconds ""in the first 4 and a half minutes only"". It's Sky Sports HD that's fucked up. He switched the channel to Sky Select after that brutal first 5 minutes."
,AlexLibman,2012-07-19T02:56Z,"Good point, arjay45 - the initial freezes are not the uploader's fault (through the quality of the overall encoding and audio are also sub-par).

People should stop seeding this now that better copies are available."
