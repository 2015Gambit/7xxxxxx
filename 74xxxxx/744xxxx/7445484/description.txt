Summary:
The ghost of a young girl who was killed in a man's garage appears in his house; the spirit of a man who died during the Salem witch trials appears to a group of women; a spirit pushes a woman down a flight of stairs at a dance studio; and the spirits of prohibition-era gangsters are captured on film.
