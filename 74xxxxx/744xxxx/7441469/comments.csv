,nosnavis,2012-07-17T08:27Z,what's its name?
,luthersin,2012-07-17T23:13Z,"Well, it was going to be ""Share This Book"".  But to avoid confusion with this -- http://freesouls.cc/essays/01-christopher-adams-share-this-book.html -- I'm switching back to the original title, Pirate This Book: 95 Essays for the End of the World.  Since nobody's seeding this one anyway, would everyone please use this link instead?  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7452715"
