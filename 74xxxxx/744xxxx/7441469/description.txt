This is the first part of my first book.  I will release four more by December 21st.  I encourage everyone to share it with their friends, electronically or on paper.  Please feel free to print out individual essays and do whatever you like with them.  Information does not belong to any individual, and I'd be a hypocrite if I refused to put my own art up for .torrent after downloading other people's.  So, here you are.  Seed if you like it!
