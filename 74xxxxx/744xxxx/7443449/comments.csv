,NeoYurri,2012-07-16T03:54Z,"Does that mean that it is unusable?
Due to the bugs and all?"
,ijam_j,2012-07-17T02:07Z,"thank you very very much. the best garrys mod release ever!. the stability issue is not of this release. the original game IS unstable(beta 13). 

by the way, where exactly do you put the addons folder?"
,bruss.aka.durka9,2012-07-17T12:35Z,"to ijam_j
In game dir create ""SteamApps"" dir and copy all *.gcf."
,ijam_j,2012-07-21T08:43Z,"pardon my prev comment. i thought this is beta 13. its not. probably stable 12. 

anyway, copied gcf files to manually created SteamApps folder inside install directory and addons worked fine. unfortunately, i cant play garry mod today. i dont install steam on this pc. i get ""steam dll isnt worthy of our trust"" message. what to do?

thanks."

I will produce new build. Wait."
,zardaxian,2012-08-13T17:50Z,"i know hot to fix the ""steam dll isnt worthy of our trust""! at least for the moment,its a temp fix that requiers you to change some stuff everytime you load a new game! 
This is what you do :
-start the game,get the error.
-go to install dir look for a steam_appid.txt
-open the file with notepad
-change the last number to 4001 or 4000
-save and launch the game
-next time you get the error change the number again and so on 
-works for me,thank me and thank uploader for an amazing job!"
