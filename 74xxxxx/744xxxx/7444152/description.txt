okay. so after trying out dozens of ebook readers,turns out that none is as fast and customizable as ireader. EVEN THOUGH it doesnt support epub,it converts mobi files automatically to txt files. AND you dont need to have your sd card inserted after using it for the first time every time you want to read. this version has total english interface unlike the new versions that are chinese. this one also has options to change almost everything as far as reading interface is concerned. as a bonus i have added background images for reading(for both day and night modes).the images are in a seperate folder, so its optional if you dont want to download them. the ireader file size is only 2.10 mb. so well..enjoy. and please seed.
                                 - MAXI.
