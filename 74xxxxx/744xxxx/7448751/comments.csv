,jimbuck2,2012-07-27T20:13Z,Gee I thought it was just me.  I don't understand how some magnets never seem to acquire more seeds.  I've signed on to this thing 10 days ago and it's dl'd in trickles; I just reached 93% myself today. The tpb seed counter during that time has toggled between 0 and 1.
,gnomad,2012-07-28T17:43Z,Looks like everyone is up to 98%.  I wonder if the one apparent seeder is still using dial-up internet and shares the line for voice communications...
,jimbuck2,2012-07-29T04:26Z,"Wow, Gnomad, we made it!  Only 12 days later and the number of seeders shot up from 0 to 94.  Let's pop the champagne."

I see a *lot* of chopped up PDF files on the disc, but they are almost useless without the index."
