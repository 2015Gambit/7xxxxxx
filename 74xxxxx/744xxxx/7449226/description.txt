 Wrong Audio for the Dennis Prager Show
 This show 'The Dennis Prager Radio Show JULY-12-2012 THURS' has the wrong third hour. The third hour is the same as 
 the third hour of this show 'The Dennis Prager Radio Show JULY-11-2012 WED'.

 I would appreciate if you could fix that. Thank you for putting up these shows a lot :)





WOOPS!......i just checked it and you are correct....listened to the third hour of both...
 and they are both the same size...and they are the same hour...but the website put that up for download...
 the website had it there as a mistake...the way it is written is the format it comes in when you download it...
 i don't write it that way...so on the website now they have corrected it...
 the wrong one is 16,677kb and the corrected one is  16,315kb...both in the same written format...
 someone on the prager staff made that mistake...should i put the new corrected hour into today's downloaded show or 
 re-do the thursday show or just upload this new 3rd hour all by itself???
