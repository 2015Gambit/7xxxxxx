2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

we're up to 25 bundles of this Christian Music for 2012.  Downloading all 25 torrents will account for 662 releases this year - Nearing my goal of sharing 1,000 by the end of the year.

As always, please continue to seed for a little longer than you perhaps otherwise would have.  Once this torrent is fully seeded, I will no longer be able to stick around and support it.
