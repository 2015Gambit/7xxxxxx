however....REALLY BAD MOVIE ALERT!! lol
For 10 year olds and morons this one. I'd be more comprehensive but this movie doesn't deserve any more of my time to be spent on it. Stay away! It's not even so bad that it's funny....it's worse than that. "

Very bad movie."

,Kiriyama87,2012-07-20T05:48Z,"Holy shit, how did Sean Bean end up in this piece of garbage?

Everything is wrong about this movie. The script sucks, the dialogue sucks, the acting sucks apart from the ""big"" actors. The equipment they have used sucks. I could just feel by the quality of the sound that this movie would suck. 

It doesn't deserve a 4.8 on imdb, should he a 2 MAX.

But thanks for the upload
A:9 (as good as it gets with that crap equipment)
V:9
M:1.5 only because of Sean Bean, and I'm generous."
