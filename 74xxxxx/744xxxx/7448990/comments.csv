hmmm those german psyhic females very hot looking

I bet they got a german rod added to them to boost
their antennas on a daily basis :)

was a fun docu that one 
UFO_Docu_The Aldebaran Mystery - Nazi UFO Secrets_UFOTV_39min.xvid.avi

I always wonder though.. like in ufo hunters the guy pointed out
the structure seemed the same as gas and water storage buildings
not a launch pad for a test ufo

regardless though.. they would need lots of water to cool
some testing of experimental stuff and considering the
ufo used vortex of water for its engine..

it still might have some truth behind it 

but launch pad I doubt!"

the fox news should say 1949 not 1947 that one
was the roswell incident :)

correct when get it for your collections"
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T11:00Z,the Igor chat was very interesting on the camelot one
[V],psspss,2012-07-17T13:58Z,";D  im not seeding this now..over 30 have it.. so keep it going

might have to redo that one

was 3am and didnt do a intense check like normally do and see the camelot igor one has some
minor corruption happening at bottom
might have a play to fix that one also.. very annoying
