doujin shmup (shoot-em-up)

collection of 27 favourite vertical scrolling shooters etc

ALL of these have been controller tested and virus scanned
ALL will work with xbox 360 or other usb controller/joystick

simply run the main .exe from each game folder to play
most of these games are half english half japanese
so just click until you can shoot, its pretty simple
