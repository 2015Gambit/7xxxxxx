,MissAnthropy,2012-07-18T02:24Z,"The version number is wrong. There is no OS X 10.1.8

This appears to be identical to this well-seeded version of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8

,SP20x6,2012-07-26T04:11Z,"@MissAnthropy: Exactly right, it's the exact same .dmg, just named poorly. I checked against my existing .dmg and the torrent verified perfectly. This is OS X version 10.8.0 GM, build 12A269. "
,iMacintosh,2012-07-26T07:41Z,can someone tell me if this works or not? just a solid yes or no would be nice. also if there are any major bugs? i'm not sure if i should download it or not.
