Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time


Sources:
Video: Arabic Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (2012).DVDRip.[ARABIC]-JohnPc666
Audio: ADTRG Source Line, thx guys great quality stuff

Encode:
The Arabic DVDRip only had Arabic Audio, but thats no problem we have line
so i synced it with my usual lipsync method right on it.
The Arabic Video was a straight forward rip with bitrate 1400. The colours
and brightness were already perfect just not cropped right, fixed that.
Since bitrate wasnt the highest there was no space to do extra sharpening
or it will get noticeably pixelated, but no biggy.
Tried to get it below 1gb.
got very nice
and yes all the endcredits are there too with retail audio
enjoy

Video: 720x384 @bitrate 1400 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 LINE
Sample: Yes, included
