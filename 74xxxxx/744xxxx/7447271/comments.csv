,buschmanmax,2012-07-19T23:38Z,A/V 9 there is a little hissing at the end (like the last 3 mins or so) but its not REAL bad and overall doesnt effect the film much i just suggest DLing and using subtitles for it at least for those few mins. ty for the upload hackulus. here's a link to some good subs. http://v2.subscene.com/english/dr-seuss-the-lorax-2012/subtitle-601686.aspx
