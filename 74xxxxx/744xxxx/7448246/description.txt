  Based in Simla, the McNallys are an          
  Anglo-Indian family consisting of Paul       
  and his wife, Catherine. Both are full       
  of joy when Catherine gives birth to a       
  baby girl, Michelle, but their joy is        
  short-lived when they are told that          
  Michellle cannot see nor hear. Both          
  attempt to bring up Michelle in their        
  own protective way, as a result Michelle     
  is not exposed to the real world, and        
  becomes increasingly violent and volatile.   
  Things only get worse when Catherine gives   
  birth to Sara, and Paul considers admitting
