,gaurav872,2012-07-16T05:37Z,thanx !! eztv team 
,captmorgan19,2012-07-16T06:05Z,"I don't know how you guys do it - but I intend to enjoy the tv series downloads while they last!  I watched this BB episode via live stream and couldn't believe how quickly you had this available just after the episode finished.  I'm seeding as I write and thank you eztv team.

One other thing - to those that ""comment"" asking for .avi type files....stop asking.  Go to Walmart or Sams and buy a VIZIO (or research and find a TV that has A/V & HDMI conx). Currently the 32"" can be gotten for $275 - smaller screen even cheaper.  It has all kinds of A/V input plugs and if you have the ability to download these torrents and watch them on your computer - chances are that you can plug into, and watch on the VIZIO.

You want to burn a DVD - download ConvertXtoDVD and use it to make a DVD from eztv's files."

,JamsBand,2012-07-16T07:42Z,"@CombustionMan1 ?? Another stupid comment.. at least you didn't yell ""seed people"" (the douchebagyest comment one can make).
So I guess you've studied Breaking Bad fans seeding habits hey? I got this in 3 minutes just an hour after he posted it. Seems to be seeded fine.
Thanks EZtV"

,SrMLove,2012-07-18T03:37Z,"@captmorgan19 : YES THANK YOU! i have said the same thing in every torrent comment section i see where some dumb ass asks for a avi. file version.(although let them figure it out for themselves... or they have to pay).... either they take the time to learn or they can be lazy and be forced to pay due to ignorance(they aren't asking help... they are bitching).... netflix has to be in business for a reason....... you guys are getting free shit... stop bitching over such little things like a request for avi.....which by the way... avi. files are not used any more b/c people have external hard drives that are in the multi terabit range. and faster d/l speeds.MP4s are the ones to use.Everything about them are better. Unless your computer is from the 90s in which case, i don't even know where to begin. The majority of people on TPB(and torrent sites in general) and consider themselves to be the least bit intelligent when it comes to computers and/or torrents do not like avi. files. they consider them to be outdated, aggravating, and they are broken files. Who the hell wants to load a file into a media player, and then have to have it repair itself every time. it is like loading the same file twice. i don't know about everyone else... but that slow is too slow for me. and on this comment forum me and the captain agree and are making it known."
,nosnavis,2012-07-18T08:21Z,"Thanks man
great show
keep them coming "
,snowdog1,2012-07-18T09:36Z,Always good... Numero Uno guys.  Got to love how Walt has developed as a teacher. Thanx...
,googooguy,2012-07-19T04:01Z,What's up with the stupid password protection.   Don;t waste your time downloading this mess.   
,ironymon,2012-07-20T08:26Z,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!! IT""S out already? Fuck yeah."
,snowdog1,2012-07-20T09:55Z,"Another good effort from eztv. I agree with captmorgan19 and SrMLove, if you aren't happy with what is on offer, search the web, find better and how you want it to be THEN U UPLOAD for the rest of us. eztv have been flying the flag for a long time to benefit us, and it is greatly appreciated."
,marko8,2012-07-20T17:35Z,Thanks
,satejamu,2012-07-20T19:49Z,"Faaaake! How many of you morons actually ""watched"" the video before commenting?"
,Pogue.Mahone,2012-07-20T23:51Z,"wow, great quality! thanks!
a/10 (great quality, clear, crisp. no annoying hissing or chatter)
v/8-9 (clear with no breakups or pixelation. not br quality but it's not off br!) "
,peegeeo,2012-07-22T23:26Z,ok
,derouki011,2012-07-23T04:16Z,What is the password?
,thestygg,2012-07-23T04:34Z,"satejamu:

You sir are pathetic. Did YOU even watch before posting such a dumb comment? I watched it just now and it was all good. People like you make me sick. Your mother must be proud to have given birth to such an intelligent lad. "
,derouki011,2012-07-23T05:16Z,"In all these comments about how good it is, no one can post the password?"
,derouki011,2012-07-23T07:02Z,"Bullshit, can't get a password. If any of these posts were true they would have given the password right off. I've gotten plenty of stuff from eztv and never a password protected archive. WASTE OF TIME!"
,firexninja,2012-07-25T05:38Z,thank you!
,lukoro,2012-07-27T01:51Z,"Fuck off you faggot. THERE IS NO PASSWORD!!! This is eztv, THE best upper/s on TPB. The hell's the point of posting those comments?"
,Voodstoc,2012-07-27T15:23Z,"Thanks,eztv.  Always happy with your ups."
,AlienBit,2012-08-01T00:56Z,"Jerky movement, Pixelation in some scenes , Fluctuations in brightness. Is anyone else seeing this or is it just my computer/media player? I'm using Winamp by the way"
,AlienBit,2012-08-01T01:03Z,I think people keep confusing these legit files for the ones that keep getting uploaded by someone anonymous that says eztv and contain the .rar file. Usually the first one uled and then removed by owners.
,AlienBit,2012-08-01T01:29Z,I just watched it on Quick-Time Player and the pixelation and brightness fluctuation was gone. Still a little jerky. I gonna get a better pewter soon anyways.
,MrPPV,2012-08-02T03:43Z,"To all the fags posting that this is fake or needs a password

Please Fuck Off

However, there is a band at the bottom of the image which is a result of not using a multiple of 16 for the height."
