It points out imperfections in Western history and society, but the source of this film is a greater evil by many orders of magnitude.  This film is probably the greatest example of hypocrisy the world has ever seen!

Many socialist idiots on the Internet will love this...  They'd gladly get in bed with North Korea to make capitalism look bad for -- oh horror -- giving stupid people the freedom to overindulge.  In reality those undisciplined people are the losers in a capitalist society, while being a winner requires discipline, intelligence, frugality, and hard work.

Yes, the Bush Administration overstated the reasons for invading Iraq, including the exaggerated risk of WMD's.  Without a regime change, this risk obviously would have increased by now.  Iraq being a socialist (Ba'athist) hell-hole in perpetual war against its populace should have been cause enough, and this war has saved millions of lives.  Nations like South Korea and Chile stand as a shining example of what happens when you defeat the communists, while cesspools of human misery like modern-day Vietnam, Cuba, or North Korea are all consequences of complacency, appeasement, or defeatism.

Any war against a socialist government (starting at the very bottom of the Economic Freedom Index) is a war of liberation!  Governments have no rights, only individuals do!"
