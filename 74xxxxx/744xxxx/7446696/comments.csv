but i still think her best sets are at WAH -

Any chance you have these ?

In my humble opinion the WAH stuff is so much more better than the recent ATKHairy stuff by a wide margin,too bad skullman/FatFreddy777 isn't around here no more,he had access to WAH."
[V],bestec1234,2012-07-15T23:58Z,What is it you like better about the WAH sets?
,micron66,2012-07-16T03:08Z,"@bestec

well,generally the models at WAH are better looking and younger than the ATKHairy one's since 2011,looking at the recent ATKHairy updates,you can clearly see their models are generally 30-40 +"
[V],bestec1234,2012-07-17T03:17Z,"I agree, lately most of the ATK models have not been under 30.  But, there's still plenty of past models that are."
,micron66,2012-07-17T03:43Z,"@bestec

yup, you are right about that,overall ATK still has one of the best (and vast) model collections.

by the way,i just did an 8 GB siterip of KarupsHA,which i will be uploading over the coming weeks,they have some great looking models too."
