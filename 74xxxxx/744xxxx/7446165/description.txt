Nature's Power Revealed
We can't control them, we can't accurately predict them, and they can produce some of our biggest tragedies, but nature's awesome powers have also shaped Earth, replenishing and renewing it every day. From the molten core of our planet to the protective embrace of our atmosphere and the water which supports all life, watch as we reveal nature's greatest powers.



5)  Tracking the Killers 
Everyone talks about the weather. Meet the brave and dedicated people who are trying to do something about it. In this compelling program, you will fly aboard thirty-year-old warplanes into the eye of a hurricane and sail with the International Ice Patrol in search of icebergs. You will face towering walls of water and mountains of fire. You will scan the skies on alert for asteroids on a collision course with our planet. You will watch and listen, map and monitor, to try to predict when nature's greatest nightmares will strike next. Harrowing tales from those who have survived volcanic eruptions and tsunamis show what is at stake for scientists and storm trackers whose research and actions can make the difference between life and death.
