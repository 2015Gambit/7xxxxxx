1436 Snes games on 1 playable disk Wii
Ntsc tested.
brought to you by Randmvilnce.

This is my collect of super nintendo Roms its 1436 Snes Games mostly all ntsc. with the emulator built all into 1 playable Wii disk! no more loading them onto the Wii, just play them right off this disk.
just load the disk, goto "Apps" directory and run "SNES loader", after that goto load game from dvd, then pick the game you want from the "Roms" folder, the are split up into 4 groups to make it easyer to find games. just select the game and play it!be sure to start the snes loader or it won't work. its that easy.
this is my 1st attempt at making a multi game disk with gamecube stuff so its not perfect and pretty, but its decent. I also have an n64 and gameboy advanced pack comming out for the wii soon when i finish it so keep a look out for them as well.
i have packed this gamecube disk myself and can verify it in working order. you must use the GAMECUBE controller to play all these games not the classic controller, but thats the only stipulation. get one at any pawnshop for cheap.
need someone with a pal system to test this if their willing and post results.
enjoy and GL
