,max_planck_no_1,2012-07-20T18:33Z,I love you uploader
,PADDYWHACKED,2012-07-31T10:16Z,The video is just a green screen for me. Am i doing something wrong? I am using VLC
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-31T22:33Z,Paddywack download the latest one or Use K-lite codecs
,TheNexus18,2012-08-01T04:45Z,"Dude, the picture's full of fucking pixels.  I don't know if that's just me because uTorrent stopped responding and I had to close it and open it once.  It's never done this before, though.  But yeah, the colour's messed up and there are pixels everywhere in several parts of the episodes, and I'm using VLC Player.  I'll try again, but if that doesn't work then..."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-01T14:32Z,is 10bit so you have to use a player that supports 10bit Properly or else you will see either a green screen or rainbow colors all over the video. Download K-lite Codecs or the Latest VLC or VLC Nighly
,TheNexus18,2012-08-01T16:09Z,"*Sigh* Well, fuck that, all I can handle are downloaded shows.  I dunno the password for me to get more programs and my mom's bitchy that way. :/ Thanks anyway."
,tatasGR,2012-09-17T05:16Z,Thanks for your work really thanks a million. But in episode 3 starts with English language and when you choose to change audio the other audio is in English too.If you could upload again episode 3 of the First season. :)
,namshub,2012-09-17T20:09Z,"This series is excellent, one of my favorites. A classic. Up there with GitS, Bebop, and Champloo.

Hey, look at all those leechers. Why is quality only at +5? You'd think they'd have the decency to perform one small, unselfish task in return for getting the entire run of a great series. For free, these selfish fucks get both seasons, high-res, dual-audio - that someone took the time to upload for them.

You'd think at least the people who are seeding back would at least do it.

And all they had to do was click one little fucking thing.

This place is full of greedy assholes."
