Collecting Indie, it is soon clear it is not very useful to make one big pile. So I thought, a little more precise indication would be handy. So this is my first attempt and start with ΓÇ£Private IndieΓÇ¥ followed by a number indicating the sound quality (1 = Top, 2 = HQ, etc.). Other Indie libraries may follow. The involved playlists will contain tracks, not included in the monthly releasesΓÇª.. Enjoy,
