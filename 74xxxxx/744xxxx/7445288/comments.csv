,jesusshockwave,2012-07-27T01:23Z,"IF you are playing the Quicktime version of Alpha Key Sets it is likely that your disc system can't keep up with the bandwidth of the files. This is because those special files have an alpha (transparency) channel built into them which allows for perfect masking when used in editing or live performances. This also results is larger files as you have noticed. I'm not sure how you are using the files, but usually an editor will use these on top of other files showing your other images and videos through the TV bezels created by that alpha channel - and when rendered out (without alpha) the file size is as expected so your disc system can handle them as usual. If you don't want to use them in an editing program and prefer using them as-is with the black TV screens, you can export them to any format you choose without an alpha channel (even another Quicktime file - maybe using PJPEG codec). Since the alpha channel won't be included the files will be smaller and your discs will be able to play them back once as usual. 

These days it's most often the disc system is the culprit of glitches rather than processors - as you picked up on. Very high quality files - like those we offer - especially those with alpha channels often must be pre-rendered into a delivery codec (PJPEG, H264, etc) before they can be played back on a single-disc machine. To get around this an solid state drive (SSD) or hardware RAID array can be used. If you have After Effects you can also do a ""RAM preview"" to see that the videos are actually perfect when playing from system memory. 

I hope this helps :)   "
