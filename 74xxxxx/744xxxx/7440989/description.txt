BBC One - Weird Nature - Peculiar Potions

Discover starlings that use aromatherapy, chimps that administer their own medicine and an odd amphibian that can heal itself. The last programme in this exploration of strange animal behaviour reveals how animals use drugs and alcohol. Discover bee bouncers that stop drunk and disorderly bees returning to the hive, monkeys whose liking for happy hour tells is about our own drinking habits and lemurs that take mind-altering millipedes. There are hedgehogs that indulge in strange rituals, cats that get high on plants and reindeer whose fondness for magic mushrooms may have spawned the greatest legend of them all.
