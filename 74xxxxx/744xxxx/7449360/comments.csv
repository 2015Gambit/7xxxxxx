It looks to be at least 6 weeks old based on the upload date.

I just viewed The America's Cup World Series ""Final"" LIVE on TV held on Aug24,2012 On San Francisco Bay.

Just curious how many ""Final"" events will be held and where.

The actual America's Cup final ""final"" is to be held in summer 2013."
