About Mix>> This mix has very little distortion, i was very carful never to go into the reds, i did a couple of times but i had my Line Output and -12db to help prevent distortion, the mix is completely Line Out and recompressed at 320kbps, i was thinking of adding a sloped bass boost from 20hz to 120hz, post fader, but id like to give you guys a seemingly RAW output.

About>> Ive started djing sence i was 13, i recently bought a used DJM-400 and some new CDJ-400's and i really thought from my taking from The Pirate Bay, that I should give back and well im 15 and here now to give back with this mix, i hope you guys enjoy it, and please ask for more.
