I buy a 2TB hardrive jajaja."
,thejbird,2012-07-15T06:02Z,"@tr108, i really love your releases. I was wondering, what software do you use for converting your videos to m4v? I have tried a few, namely Xilisoft Video Converter (which creates a 6.0GB file from a 4.37GB MKV file, [keeping all aspect and quality settings the same]) and XMedia Recode which freezes upon conversion. I use Windows 7, and would like to know of any programs you might suggest for your beatiful quality and very low file size? Thanks a million, J-Bird."
,DoubleR46,2012-07-16T14:06Z,"@tr108 thanks again for these awesome videos.  I would like to know if you are able to upload some Will Smith movies and Friends with Benefits?

Thanks again!!"
[T],tr108,2012-07-17T18:56Z,"@thejbird - I use HandBrake (it's freeware; Mac & Windows) to convert my videos. The app comes with very good presets for many devices, the custom presets I use can be found here:

(In case it matters, I will upload a complete step-by-step next month)

@DoubleR46 - No Friends with Benefits, sorry. Which Will Smith movies were you thinking of?"
,IronPumper1986,2012-07-17T23:22Z,"Thanks for this. Love your encodes. I actually bought an Apple TV! 

Anyway, would you be able to do Limitless, Man On Fire, The Matrix Trilogy, or The Godfather Trilogy?

What do you presently have on your to do list? (just out of curiosity)

Thanks again, and keep it up!"
,thejbird,2012-07-18T07:11Z,"@tr108 sick man i appreciate it, i'm looking into that right now. Your releases are epic man, you are the new HolyRoses and your doing a much better job than he"
,DoubleR46,2012-07-19T09:41Z,"@tr108 i was just thinking Men in Black 1 and 2, iRobot and I am Legend"
,DoubleR46,2012-07-19T10:48Z,also can the first sherlock holmes be uploaded as well?
[T],tr108,2012-07-19T19:02Z,"@thejbird - thanks for the love. HR's a legend (and I hope he'll be back soon).

@DoubleR46 - I, Robot should happen (I own the BD), not sure about the others but I'll try.

@IronPumper1986 - congrats on the AppleTV (it's a phenomenal, VERY underrated device).

The Matrix films will be up in about 4-5 days from now. The Godfathers should happen (no ETA tho) as my friend owns those. The other two films are unlikely.

The to-do list (in terms of films) includes only the 1st 3 Bourne films right now. Serious uploading (including -- finally! -- some new releases) should resume in mid-August. (My computer busy till then)

Feel free to hit me up on Twitter guys (@techrod108), checking multiple threads is becoming too much of a time drain."
,IronPumper1986,2012-07-22T05:29Z,"Awesome. Thanks! What about Tarantino films, e.g. Inglorious Basterds?"
