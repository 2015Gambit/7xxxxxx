You are a massive noob.
This film is 2.35 aspect ratio. If you want to trim and expand it to fit a 16x9 screen you can do it yourself. Some of us have projectors and we want the WHOLE FILM with nothing CROPPED."

I dont care a fk ""some of us"" have a stupid projector, its not 1080p, as easy as thats not the height of the film. 

1080p/HDFull is a HD display using 1080 progressive height lines, not 816.

You can find plenty of real 1080p vids here and they dont ask u to crop and rencode it. Thats the same as If I upload something half the res in desc and tell you to rencode it.

Do you get it? Or are you quite stupid to understand so easy argue? 1080p in 2.35 ar is 2538*1080p for a stupid projector, not 1920*816, no way thats 1080p, even for you."
,Toperharrier,2012-07-25T01:17Z,"Wikipedia, for you, who all know, Mr. Projector:

""1080p is a set of HDTV high-definition video modes that are [b]characterized by 1080 horizontal lines of vertical resolution[1][/b] and progressive scan, meaning the image is not interlaced as is the case with the 1080i display standard. The term [b]assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, thus implying a resolution of 1920 Ă 1080 (2.1 megapixels).[/b]

Sometimes referred to in marketing materials as Full HD, 1080p typically refers to the capability to accept 1080p signal and display it with native resolution of at least 1080 lines, as well as the capability to upscale lower-resolution material to 1080p. The HD ready 1080p logo program by DIGITALEUROPE requires that certified TV sets support 1080p24, 1080p50, and 1080p60 formats, and among other requirements, [b]feature a native resolution of at least 1920Ă1080 pixels.[/b] The frame rate can be either implied by the context or specified after the letter 'p', such as 1080p30, meaning 30 progressive frames per second.""

Now, can you tell me where is the ""at least"" 1920*1080 (2.1Mp) in a 1920*816 (1,5Mp..) video? Do the 0,6Mp left come with the projector?"
