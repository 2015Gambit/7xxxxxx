RipIt ... Movies are great, but discs are a pain. RipIt gets your movies off the disc and onto your Mac, where it's easier to find, organize and play them.

Why Rip Your DVDs?

Use your laptop longer!
Laptops use a lot more juice when they're spinning a DVD and a hard drive.
Easily organize your movies!
Moving files around on your computer is a lot easier than alphabetizing shelves full of DVDs.
Find movies faster!
Use your Mac's built in search tool, Spotlight, to find a movie in your collection... instantly.
Peace of mind!
Movies stored safely in your computer can't get lost, scratched or broken.
Simplify entertainment on the go!
Why carry around bulky DVD cases or disc wallets when you don't have to?
