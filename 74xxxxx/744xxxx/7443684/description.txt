Volcano Live
Ever wanted to know more about volcanoes or see one erupting? Well the BBC is finding out all about them in a series of special programmes from Hawaii. The show will feature volcanoes erupting and will look at some of the most famous volcanic eruptions in history. Hawaii is made up of a string of islands formed by molten rock called magma erupting from the seabed and creating volcanoes. Professor Iain Stewart and Kate Humble will present Volcano Live from Kilauea on Hawaii, the world's most active volcano


1)  Our Active World 
Kate Humble and geologist Iain Stewart explore the science of vulcanology and how Kilauea on Hawaii's Big Island is transforming the terrain that surrounds it. Live action is interspersed with pre-recorded footage of expeditions around the world, and this edition features a helicopter ride around the Eyjafjallajoekull volcano. Plus, comedian Ed Byrne heads to Bristol University to learn about different eruptions.
