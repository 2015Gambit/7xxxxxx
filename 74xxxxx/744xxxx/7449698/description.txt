      0-Day Art is a warez group for art, focusing primarily on digitally
      represented works. The project began in response to situations where
      takedown notices, pay walls, and practices of "taking it offline"
      threaten the distribution and availability of art online.

      Using BitTorrent to package and distribute "art warez" within 24
      hours of its initial availability and social networks to quickly
      spread the word, 0-Day Art exists at the intersection of art
      critique, hackivism, and open culture.
      
      This talk, presented at HOPE 9, covers a brief history of ΓÇ£The SceneΓÇ¥ 
      (warez, demo, and net art) and the birth of 0-Day Art. Past projects, 
      current challenges, and the future of 0-Day Art will be discussed.
