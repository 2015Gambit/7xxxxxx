Gossamer is Passion Pit's second studio LP and the follow-up to their 2009 breakout hit record, Manners. It includes singles "Take a Walk," "I'll Be Alright" and "Constant Conversations." Be advised that the sixth song, "Cry Like a Ghost," seems to skip around a minute and a half in. It's a minor error and I haven't spotted any other issues, so I hope you enjoy the album as much as I did. (My personal favorite is "Carried Away.") It's set to be released on July 23, 2012. Please seed!
