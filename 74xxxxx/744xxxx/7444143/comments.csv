,ext23,2012-07-16T12:40Z,"the tracks are real, but something about the sound quality is suspect. definitely some kind of re-encode."
,Coufi,2012-07-17T00:09Z,very nice leak !! thanks
,Demon_Raho,2012-07-17T01:46Z,Damn. All of these songs are awesome.
,AtheistLoveChristmas,2012-07-17T09:05Z,Yes! I don't know why their singer is going through some kind of nervous/social/anxiety/breakdown cancelling tour dates and whatnot because these songs are fucking awesome. If I could write songs like these I wouldn't be afraid of the spotlight pointed at me. Represent this stuff!  Good quality upload. See em live if they can take their pills and show up. 
,AtheistLoveChristmas,2012-07-17T09:08Z,Just fuh kin  around on that last line. I have no idea what these guys have to put up with. It might be substantiated.
