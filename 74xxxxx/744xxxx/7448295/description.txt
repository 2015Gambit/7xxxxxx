Sinbad Ep 2-Queen of the Water Thieves
Cursed by his grandmother and pursued by vengeful Prince Akbari (Naveen Andrews), a life on the ocean wave seems a sensible option for Sinbad. But when he and the crew of The Providence (are they motley or just bizarrely cast?) run into an ominous, skull-obsessed island tribe, their luck seems to have run out. Our hero is soon in thrall to Razia, Queen of the Water-Thieves (Sophie Okonedo), and her pet bird, a giant, scabrous vulture. Is Sinbad sunk?
