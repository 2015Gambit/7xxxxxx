,PhillySoul,2012-07-16T09:24Z,"Correction: I mislabeled “LFDH56_6_Talking To You (Is Like Talking To Myself).” 
The actual title should be “LFDH56_6_Talking To Myself”
I renamed it before watching the episode…The webmaster of LFDH often gets the song titles wrong (spot the misspelling in the title graphic on the video of “Fall in Philadelphia”). I just assumed Talking to Myself was the song from Daryl’s new solo album, “Laughing Down Crying”…sadly it is not.
Sorry!"
