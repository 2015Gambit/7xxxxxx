Whether it's the first course or the entire menu, fondue is the perfect party food or casual company dinner: it provides an instant theme; the little prep needed is done well in advance; and it's guaranteed to create a leisurely, cozy atmosphere. From Northern California's wine and cheese country comes Cowgirl Creamery's head cheesemonger Lenny Rice and culinary instructor Brigid Callinan with a collection of fifty fondue recipes combining the fun of the seventies craze with the complex tastes of European tradition-all in one fondue pot.



 You'll find recipes for tried-and-true classics made with traditional as well as artisanal cheeses, novel spin-offs on favorite flavors like pizza and French onion soup, and chocolate and caramel desserts that will keep the tea lights burning long and bright. And should a melted pound of cheese or chocolate not be reason enough, you'll also find deliciously creative accompaniment and beverage pairing suggestions sure to inspire a return to blessedly uncomplicated and authentic fondue.
