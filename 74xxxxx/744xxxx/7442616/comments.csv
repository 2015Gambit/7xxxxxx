,motley666,2012-07-14T20:37Z,Today's games are shit.
,Poganin,2012-07-14T20:42Z,This game isn't really playable on modern PCs. Or are there some fixes that I don't know of?
,PirateerG,2012-07-15T07:26Z,I've played this game just recently on Windows 7 using DOXBox and found it to be well playable. In DOSBox you can limit the CPU cycles and you can even use a modern USB joystick. Just take a look at the torrent's Info.txt for more.
