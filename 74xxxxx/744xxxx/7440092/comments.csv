another one cappers arent doing.. and
so called person thats said to steal tnes work proves again
I can provide many paranormal shows along with many other shows not just

destin truth etc :) regardless if its a stream or floating about somewhere online

and share it to p2p and running on a shoe string budget and crappy internet providers to boot"
,leander3932,2012-07-14T02:15Z,hello there. thank you. we appreciate all your hard work. love ya . xox
,bubbanuggzz,2012-07-14T12:54Z,"don't listen to the haters man.tne was always late with the good shows & no matter how much he lies about it he didn't cap his own stuff.he may have tweeked it himself but he wasn't the source.plus you always gave him credit when you converted his stuff anyway so he has no reason to bitch.hes just mad cuz hes not at the center of the para-normal universe anymore.maybe if he up'd xvids like the people wanted than you wouldnt have had to.you gave the ppl what they wanted & look where you are now,he gave them what HE wanted & look where he is...nough' said"
[V],psspss,2012-07-14T14:25Z,"i dont see a issue never have.. he does only mp4s and I do only xvids.. and add ext torrents to other formats sometimes else where

he can use any of my uploads on his blog if wants
no issues here
e.g. weird or what or ghost stories 2009 etc "
,carrigart140,2012-07-14T18:11Z,many thanks for this i always look for your updates
,xpmule,2012-07-15T04:43Z,"bottom line, you have posted another cool show that was not on TPB yet in any format etc.
So right on thanks for sharing.

I lot of people bend over backwards to upload the same crap a million times for no good reason and i see you on the other hand try and provide what falls through the cracks and the scene misses.

I know you've had some drama lately and all i can say is it seems like you are genuinely trying help and not being deceptive (about sources) on purpose."
