Special thanks to all the original uploaders and release groups.Remember to seed back..


Note: This is 16:9(Widescreen) and it should be 4:3(Fullscreen). They look stretched. so u can fix it by using vlc..by pressing 'a' button of your keyboard u can change the aspect ratio in vlc media player..just change it to 4:3 and the video will play in its original aspect ration without streching..enjoy
