,cessna711,2012-07-14T21:49Z,"It's real, I uploaded the files that I could from a newsfeed, but I can't upload the speed.cd, sfv and nfo files because they're not part of the original newsfeed post"
,Snowwie888,2012-07-14T22:38Z,"Now at 99,9%, and a lot of peers with me as well.

And atm it can't be extracted because it is in a rar volume."
