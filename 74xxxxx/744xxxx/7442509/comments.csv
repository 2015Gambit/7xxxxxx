VERY interesting document made on North Korean government directive. It show ""Western Democracy"" and all idea, values, symbols - and much more - from totally new, Fresh perspective. This is not light document trying just to ridicule and discredit - it tries to show history and present shape of Western World in holistic fashion. 
There's especially one thesis with which I do agree - we are all slaves and we all BELONG to small group of people - we are PROPERTY in prison without walls or guards. We are living in artificial reality spending our lifes on absolutely epmty and meaningless things. 
I recommend EVERYONE to watch this document and make up YOUR OWN MIND. 
I've added this torrent to my Main-Share torrent group. I'll seed it indefinitely. "

It points out imperfections in Western history and society, but the source of this film is a greater evil by many orders of magnitude. This film is probably the greatest example of hypocrisy the world has ever seen!

Many socialist idiots on the Internet will love this... They'd gladly get in bed with North Korea to make capitalism look bad for -- oh horror -- giving stupid people the freedom to overindulge. In reality those undisciplined people are the losers in a capitalist society, while being a winner requires discipline, intelligence, frugality, and hard work.

Yes, the Bush Administration overstated the reasons for invading Iraq, including the exaggerated risk of WMD's. Without a regime change, this risk obviously would have increased by now. Iraq being a socialist (Ba'athist) hell-hole in perpetual war against its populace should have been cause enough, and this war has saved millions of lives. Nations like South Korea and Chile stand as a shining example of what happens when you defeat the communists, while cesspools of human misery like modern-day Vietnam, Cuba, or North Korea are all consequences of complacency, appeasement, or defeatism.

Any war against a socialist government (starting at the very bottom of the Economic Freedom Index) is a war of liberation! Governments have no rights, only individuals do!"

The documentary is correct in calling some in the West hypocritical about their use of the word ""democracy"".  North Korea (officially called ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea""), like ancient Athens, is indeed a democracy, while West isn't.  ""Democracy"", as the etymology of the word suggests, is mob rule.  A ""liberal democracy"" or any other kind of mixed concoction is an oxymoron in theory and an unstable sliding situation in practice - the mob can ultimately overturn all laws that protect the minority.  Since people are naturally unequal at any endeavor, you always end up with some people being better at controlling the opinions of the dumber 51% of the population, who are easy to bribe with stolen (""taxed"") rewards.  Pure democracy always leads to tyranny of the political demagogues, whether it's Kim Jong-il, Adolf Hitler, or Barack Obama.  People can never be free while they are chained to each-other, even if they ""vote"" instead of fighting over in which direction to stagger.  What makes some countries better than others are limits to democracy through universally recognized and protected individual (negative) Rights.

No presently-existing country is perfect in recognition of individual Rights - it is a gradual historical process, but some countries are clearly better than others, as can be measured via approximations like the Press Freedom Index, Property Rights Index, Economic Freedom Index, and the Tax Misery Index (how much of their material rights the producers of material value get to keep).  In all cases you will find USA near the top, and North Korea near the very bottom.  You will also find a strong causal relationship between Economic Freedom (pro-capitalist governance) and prosperity.  Capitalism is the only rational form of human cooperation, exchanging value for value with no use of force, and it is also the form of existence that is historically shown to be effective at lifting nations out of poverty, making them happy and free.

You are wrong to say that ""we are all slaves and we all BELONG to small group of people"" - that's just sensationalist fear-mongering.  We do have power monopolies, but all of them come from the very thing that makes us similar to North Korea: the state.

Free market capitalism is the answer.  True, it holds an honest mirror to society, giving idiots the freedom to act like idiots, as long as they hurt no one but themselves.  Paris Hilton and her fans must be free to be stupid so that the fans of science and philosophy could be free to be smart.  Capitalism adjusts to the intellectual level of each participant: I for one live in a world without pop culture, and almost no advertising can reach me.  I don't spend my life on ""absolutely [empty] and meaningless things"" - and I encourage others to live better-examined and more virtuous lives as well.

Don't just keep parroting the popular socialist-leaning arguments - they are the low hanging fruit of intellectual discourse.  I used to be the same way (as Google can attest), and only by studying the questions openly and logically was I able to advance to the more rational position that I hold today.  Please, please get all sides of the issue.  Read Ludwig von Mises, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Bastiat, Hayek, Ayn Rand, the Friedmans, and other capitalist / libertarian economists and philosophers."

You can discredit this document by its source all you want. Problem is it is very percise - including False Flags events that leads to all Wars leaded by USA. North Korean government is a dictatorship and people of this country are suffering - no one claims differently. Point is that those people are not enslaved by western censorship and they are showing and saying things that would never be released in main stream media. 
You divided people in two simply category ""winners"" and ""loosers"" and this is your base for making judgement? Please, such banal, dichotomous division is proper for a child - not grown man who understand diversity of the world and people. Nothing is black & white - but I do understand it is easier to make such simple division for sake of your argumentation. But it's false and do to reflect our reality. 
Another thing - Bush administration did not ""exaggerated"" anything - they simply LIED. Iraq war was totally based on a conscious lie, for which those people should be prosecuted and put in jail for a long, long time. 
And last thing - yes, this documment was made by North Korean government - cruel dictatorship responsible for hundreds of thousands deaths (ex. from hunger) of its own citizens. And you should keep in mind that whatever they're saying about themselfs is a pathetic lie. 

Thing is that I find they way of perceiving Western World very accurate, even if it's still a simplification made for purposes of one and half hour movie. "
,Dramat,2012-08-15T19:42Z,"OK, your second comment was released after i've wrote mine. 
In essence, IMO, problem of our world is MONEY - ancient way of distributing goods and services which NO ONE is seems to question - with all technology we possess today and with all mental revolution people had only in last 1000 year, we still stick to this archaic method of distributing goods&services. That way you are preserving power and influences of very small group of people who right now want to change physical money in to totally virtual numbers. At the begining money had to be based in gold. Now, they are just empty things with no real value - when they withdraw all physical money and start using only ""virtual money"" they become just ""points"", shallow number on the screen which will define your and everyone else values in this system of slavery basen on such artificial concepts as ""money"" or ""property"". 

The only organization which is actually doing something about that is Zeitgeist and their Venus Project. But many people trappeed in money-based thinking can not imagine something like that, so they use known to them category/concepts and they are throwing at it such slogans as ""comunism"" or even ""facism' (which is totally ridicule and shonw that they have no idea what they are commenting on).
