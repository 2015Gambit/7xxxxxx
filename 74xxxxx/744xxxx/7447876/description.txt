NOTES
used KiNGDOM video and CM8 line audio - thanks a lot!! :)
Added about 16 sec to beginning to include full audio,
cut up, rotated, resized, sharpen, cropped, adjust a/r, etc.
One little bit of movement for a sec or two in first minute and
a half, after opening credits is all good. Audio sounds great
and synced up nice thx to CM8's work.
Make Peace and Honor the Earth! Share everything! 
Hope u all enjoy this very funny movie!
