The quality is MP3 at 320kbps the only thing better you can get and will probably never find on the internet is the WAV files which come only on CD.
Please nobody listen to this guy. Also if you do like it, support the band and go buy the album."

You are correct, the quality isn't great, I believe this is a transcode
@haydensrus
This is probably a transcode which means that the 320 kbps and the file sizes are just an illusion and that the actual quality is probably around 192 kbps. Also, wav, aiff, and flac ALL are lossless codecs, and I believe that here on the pirate bay we have a flac section so, in other words, it's relatively easy to find once the CD officially comes out.

Wasn't meaning to complain, just commenting as to the state of the files."
