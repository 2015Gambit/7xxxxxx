,gregou123,2012-07-16T17:27Z,@AlmostD Could you contact me on twitter @greggailly please ? If not then by what other means ?
,almostD,2012-07-18T14:10Z,"Give me your e-mail, I don't have a twitter account, I will send you private. Anyway everything I uploaded was already on the net, don't think I know the sources or if they are working on a crack (hope it is so anyway!).

For now those installer are useless, we need alternative files (OBJ) which are only downloadable if you buy the pack and you clic alternate download. We are waiting for people uploading those packs. Right now I have only the food pack in obj, in any case you need to reassign all the material and tweak to have almost the same result you would get with the official package. Long work, it's a lot of models."

Find your ""Models"" file. Mine was D/users/myname/My Documents/VideoCopilot/
and load the files there.
The models show up in the ""Model Browser"" and from the ""Edit"" column double click on ""none set"" and get the material by clicking down arrow and ""Load from File.."" Then go to the map file of the model you're loading."
