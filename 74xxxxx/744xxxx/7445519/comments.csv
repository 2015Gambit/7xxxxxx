,Germican,2012-08-20T10:19Z,I cant seem to find out where to register the app. And camtasia studio doesnt seem to open. It doesnt do anything at all when I click it. Any Ideas? Thanks for the great upload!
,Germican,2012-08-20T10:48Z,never mind the previous comment! I just ran a repair and the Studio worked. Turned my net off and entered the serial. Works perfect :D
,black_hol5,2012-08-22T06:21Z,"i actually had a tough time figuring out why it wasn't letting me save it to the notepad, u need too right click on the hosts file, click properties, then security tab, click the edit button under the first window, then choose your user name in the top window and click all the allow buttons to give u permission to edit that file... this allowed me to save into my hosts file :D, torrent works great btw tyvm for the upload"
