And yes, it would take some time to seed this, so be patient. It will be seeded like all my previous torrents."

,HackinGeek,2012-07-15T20:34Z,"You need an actual Xbox 360. There's no such thing as a Xbox 360 emulator. You also need a Jtag Hack or a Reset Glich Hack installed (that's a hardware modification by the way). If you have that, you can play these games."

,exon5467,2012-07-16T04:17Z,"Hi, HackinGeek.

I was just wondering.. I saw in one of your ""complete"" XBLA collections that you also have Fruit Ninja Kinect. Are you able to play that game OFFLINE on your JTAG'd Xbox 360? I got my copy from someplace else and got to play it once, but after that everytime I try to play it, the game just sends me to a ""sign in"" loop. I can no longer get past the ""slice fruit to begin"" part."
,HackinGeek,2012-07-17T18:32Z,"To reply to some of your posts:

- @MasterVG: With wasabi you can play retail isos, not XBLA, because it's emulating your DVD drive. You can't play downloadable XBLA titles from DVD. Get a JTAG or RGH and it will work (nothing else will). Your comments are also a pain to read - just use ""."" "","" and stuff to separate your sentences. And no excuses that you are French. I'm a Slovenian by the way and English is also not my primary language. But at least I know how to write sentences.
If you have problems with torrents, try links in the description above.

- @exon5467: I didn't really have a chance to try Fruit Ninja Kinect, because I have no Kinect. All these titles are just downloaded with a non-hacked Xbox360 and then Yaris-swapped. Some are then tested on my hacked machine and all that I test always work."
,MasterVG,2012-07-18T02:27Z,TA GEULE PUTAIN ILS SONT CORROMPUE FILS DE PUTE!!!!!!
,ravendrow,2012-07-19T05:13Z,hey about fruit ninja yes it works on both jtag and RGH i have it on both and it runs perfect problem lies in your d/l settings disable fakelive and you should be good
,ravendrow,2012-07-19T05:17Z,oh yeah make sure to save your new Dash launch setting if you are using the installers edit feature other wise fake live will not stay disabled and your game will still not work
