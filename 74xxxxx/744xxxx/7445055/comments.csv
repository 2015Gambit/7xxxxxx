,pipco_2,2012-07-23T16:31Z,"yes it has a k,
and it works great, thank you,

what it really needs is an nfo to explain how to use the k, it's not immediately apparent and i can see noobs asking endless questions, 

so here's what i did-

1- install the app to applications
2- run the k and hit the patch button
3- close path finder if it's open and then re-start   
    path finder
4- if your name is not in the top of the k then put
    it there, hit generate on the k and double click
    on the number it generates
5- Go to P F menu bar to PathFinderRegistration,
    paste in the number and then your name,
6- Voila!!!!!!

   thanks again, "
