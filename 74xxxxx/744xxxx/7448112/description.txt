60Mins_Australia_The_App_Revolution_Docu_Cash_By_Making_and_Selling_SmartPhone_Apps xvid avi

I converted this from a webrip 400bitrate stream to standard xvid
not the highest quality but watchable on laptop

its about the new young generations of smartphone developers making
it rich by creating phone apps and selling them for a $1 world wide

now I might have to learn Andriod and come up with a idea myself
i sure need the money .. prob easier said then done though
all this coding.. and self learning

help to seed if grabbing! cheers

enjoy

PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.
