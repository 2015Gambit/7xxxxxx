Skippyjon Jones is no ordinary kitten. When Mama sends him to his room to calm down, he bounces on his bed and lets his imagination run wild. In his mind, Skippyjon is not a little Siamese cat but a swashbuckling, sword-fighting Chihuahua named El Skippito who is ready to battle banditos all over the world. He imagines himself sneaking into a mummy's tomb and blasting off to outer space (from the spice cabinet). He battles the bad Bumble-beeto and rescues the family dog from Bobble-ito (a bobble-head toy.) The lively pace, clever rhyming wordplay, and irresistible artwork of the Skippyjon Jones books have made them favorites of kids (and grown-ups) everywhere.
