,sats1969,2012-07-22T20:41Z,"i burned the movie 2 times with nero and convert x to dvd and both times an error message came and said that the dvd could be unreadable,i burned them anyway,and both times when i played them on my dvd player,around 24 minutes on the movie,the picture is a mess,freezes,lots of pixels,and you cant see the movie.
sirsawa,the files have something wrong,if you want,test it yourshelf,anyway thanks a lot."
,SirSaWa,2012-07-22T23:00Z,"sats1969 - Weird?
But I will download the movie, burn and test it. But tomorrow. It's soon midnight here.
I will tell you how it goes."
,sats1969,2012-07-22T23:53Z,"it has the same problems when i try to play it with vlc or gom player,always after 24 min.

,SirSaWa,2012-07-23T12:38Z,"I checked it on VLC.

,sats1969,2012-07-23T15:41Z,"i will try and dnl this again,i'll tell you how it goes when i finish."
,sats1969,2012-07-23T16:53Z,"i dnled it again,i even updated my vlc version,but its the same ugly result.
it freezes after 24 min.maybe its not ment for me to have this movie,or,the movie itself has a problem."
,SirSaWa,2012-07-23T20:48Z,"sats1969 - No one has said anything about the problem you have. So I don't really know what it could be.
Sorry mate!"
