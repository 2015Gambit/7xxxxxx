,lukenzac,2012-08-21T15:02Z,"Hi Swegin8r

Unfortunately this appication has stopped working  for me..I reinstalled it and I did all as per your instructions, and it seemed that i had registered the product successfully..However when i went to use it i got the message ""Register Code is not correct.We strongly recommend that you copy/paste it""

Any suggestions??

Thanking you in anticipation of your help.."
,Swegin8r,2012-08-22T16:59Z,"@lukenzac: I haven't experienced this myself, but other people have reported the same problem to me. It seems to work right for some people and not for others. 

I haven't been able to duplicate the problem, so I've not had a chance to fix it. Very sorry about that mate."

Maybe try uninstalling it, disconnecting from the internet, reinstall and put the key in? That seems to work for quite a few programs. Or you could try setting up your firewall so that it doesn't let the program connect to the internet."

Well, it is pretty much standard procedure to BLOCK internet connections for these programs.  It usually cannot say your serial or #  or registration is invalid UNLESS you let it access the internet to check!!!

,isepiq,2012-09-09T05:00Z,"Ok, I blocked the internet with my software firewall (Outpost).  I  installed Magic DVD Ripper.  At the end of the install I UNchecked RUN program option.  I exited.  I put the Crack in.  I then ran the program for the first time, Firewall still blocking the internet completely.  I clicked on register & put in a name & some random characters.  Clicked & it said thank you for registering or some such.  I then went in to my firewall program & set up a BLOCK all for MagicDVDripper.exe.  I then UNblocked the rest of the internet & ran Magic DVD Ripper 3 times.  It worked every time.  Hope this helps out.
