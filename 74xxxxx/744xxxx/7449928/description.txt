FontXChange is designed to understand many different font formats and can convert fonts into many different formats. This makes FontXChange useful to:

Convert PostScript Type 1 fonts (Macintosh or Windows format) into a single modern OpenType font file that works on both Macintosh & Windows. End the headaches of the outdated two-file system of screen font and printer font combinations. Just one font file that works.
Recreate missing screen fonts using a PostScript font file in any format.
Convert TrueType fonts to PostScript fonts. No more printing problems and incompatibilities associated with TrueType fonts and high-end output devices.
Convert Windows fonts to Macintosh to Macintosh and vice-versa. Easily share fonts across different computers, even different operating systems.
