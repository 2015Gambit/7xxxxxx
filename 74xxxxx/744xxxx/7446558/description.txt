Dutch Treat will stop per the first of August. I have seeded on average about 200 playlists (selected out of 300.000 tracks) for more then a year now and I think its enough.
 
If you are missing a list, say it now and I will try to grant the requests.
The Indie playlists will continue.....Enjoy,
