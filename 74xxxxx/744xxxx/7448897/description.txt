Photography is a complex craft. Some excel at the technical side of image-making, focusing perfectly on the subject, releasing the shutter at just the right moment and making exposures with the precise amount of light. Others are artists and storytellers, capturing a fleeting moment in time which inspires a viewer to gaze upon an image and ponder its meaning. The best photographers are masters of both.

In this highly visual, informative book, Angela Faris Belt discusses the four crucial elements of photography that are essential for successful technical and conceptual image-making:

.the photographic frame and its borders
.quality of focus as determined by the aperture or lens
.shutter speeds and their effects in relation to time and motion
.the physical media used to create the aggregate image

Step-by-step guidance including informative screen shots, traditional darkroom and Photoshop techniques, suggested exercises, and before and after images help both film and digital photographers improve their skills, learn new techniques, and better understand their craft.
