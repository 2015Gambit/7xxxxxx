One of my favourite new artists, this mix includes most of the music starting from the enigmatic prelude/bounty era that drove everyone nuts all the way up to kin. Hopefully there is much more to come from iamamiwhoami but if kin is the finale then this will work as a retrospective.

This might sound like a cliche but if you like the music, support the artist! You can get the kin CD/DVD album from http://www.towhomitmayconcern.cc/ and the b o u-1 u-2 t y tracks are available as digital purchases.
