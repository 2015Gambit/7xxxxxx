Poitin
(1977, Ire, 65 min, color, English Subs)

Poitin is widely regarded as a classic of Irish cinema. It tells the story of a Conamara moonshiner, his daughter, and two cheating agents whom they outwit and bring to a tragic end. The story has a de Maupassant atmosphere, but has its comic moments. This is the digitally remastered version (2007), with new score by Bill Whelan.

Poitin stars Cyril Cusack, Niall Toibin, and Donal McCann, in their only appearance together on film. It is the first feature ever produced in the Irish language (with English subtitles). All of the supporting cast are well known Conamara actors, and the film was shot entirely on location. This new edition was sponsored by Bord Scannan na hEireann.

Extra feature: The Eleventh Hour Interview - Bob Quinn talks to Padraig Breathnach about Poitin, Budawanny, Caoineadh Airt O'Laoire et al.
