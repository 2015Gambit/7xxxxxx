Audio: 6/10 - good for cam
Video: 3/10"
,madbytes1,2012-07-15T21:23Z,So why is this movie taking so long to hit the scene?  The actual DVD/Bluray release will be here in 5 weeks and no sign of anything other than a couple bad cam copies.
,jsniper34,2012-07-17T08:53Z,@madbytes1 most probably because it is such a huge blockbuster that it is harder to obtain than ones that were not as popular etc.  thats my thoughts haha.  very keen to get my hands on it when it comes out (on pirate bay) :)
