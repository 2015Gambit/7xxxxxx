This soundtrack is so amazing and it complimented the movie very well. Hans out did him self yet again."
,nemanja15,2012-07-22T01:38Z,"I have a question about the movie.

Why isn't it out yet as a torrent?

From what I can tell the world premier was the 16th and then it hit the US on the 20th but there is still not a single version out... it is odd."

YET

(Not that theres anything wrong with that song, its actually pretty good)"
