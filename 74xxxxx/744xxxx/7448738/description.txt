This is the acoustic set from the third night of CSNY's legendary six-night run at the Fillmore East, from which the Four Way Street live album was compiled. This entire run of shows captures CSNY hot on the heels of success from the recently released Deja Vu album. This was also during the group's most prolific phase, as all four members were working on solo albums that would soon define them as individual artists.

Highlights include the Buffalo Springfield gem," On The Way Home" and Crosby's "Triad," the controversial and unreleased song he recorded near the end of his tenure with The Byrds, and which was featured on Jefferson Airplane's Crown of Creation LP. Material from the first CSN album is well represented, including a live performance of "Guinnevere." Neil Young's medley of two heavy electric numbers in this acoustic setting reveals the core elements of these classic Crazy Horse songs.

Stills closes the acoustic set with a great, bluesy "Black Queen," a piano rendition on "49 Bye-Byes" and his current hit "Love The One You're With."
