POLITICAL ANIMALS is a bold and significant look at a fictional former first family in turmoil. Elaine Barrish, a divorced former First Lady and current Secretary of State, struggles to keep her family together while simultaneously dealing with the crises of the State Department. She finds an unlikely ally in Susan Berg, a famous D.C. journalist who has spent her career tearing Elaine down. The provocative drama series will tap into the behind-the-scenes dynamics of a high-profile political dynasty, the dark â yet real â human side of life, and the often-disastrous effects of political ambition. Exploring themes that resonate in the current political landscape and taking viewers beyond the glossy ads and well-written public speeches, POLITICAL ANIMALS will reveal a vulnerable family on the verge of falling apart.
