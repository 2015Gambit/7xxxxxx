Rex Navarrete's second live standup comedy dvd taking place at the Wiltern LG theatre in Los Angeles, Oct. 22, 2005.

Mainly english language with random tagalog words thrown in for extra comedic punch. I like the 1st dvd better frankly (Hella Pinoy) but still good laughs on this one.

Sorry, no imdb info so thats why I gave a quick review. What came in the dvd is what you are going to be seeing quality wise, thats really it.

Paki seed naman po. Salamat sa lahat.
