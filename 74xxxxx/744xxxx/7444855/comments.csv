,LOVEPAREEK,2012-07-15T16:35Z,"""SABSE BADA SUKH"" WAS A GOOD COMEDY....PRINT WAS DEFECTED AT SOME PARTS ESP. IN THE BEGINNING AND END, BUT THE MOVIE WAS A GOOD COMEDY.....CUD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT COMEDY WERE IT NOT FOR THE COMPULSION OF HRISHIKESH MUKERJEE TO SPOIL THE GOODNESS BY GIVING THE OBLIGATORY TOUCH OF HUMANITY IN TH END AND A MORALLY UPRIGHT ENDING....TCH TCH.....THAT WAS A DAMPNER"
,LOVEPAREEK,2012-07-15T16:50Z,"BROWSED IMDB LINK SUGGESTED BY ANAHAD FOR ""DANAV 2003"". I WAS QUITE INTRIGUED BY WHAT I READ.....IT HAS SOME RESEMBLANCE TO A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE I WATCHED ONCE, ""BABY DOLL (1956)"".....I GUESS DANAV WUD B A NICE MOVIE....I SEARCHED BUT ITS NO WHERE AVAILABLE "

,movie.freak,2012-07-15T22:54Z,"malik bhai, AB bhai ka version kaafi low quality ka hai. sound bhi kaafi kharaab hai. shayad unka original vhs hi waqt ke saath kharaab ho gaya ho. agar aap ek behtar version upload kar den do badi meherbaani hogi. meri tarah bohat logon ko is film ka intezaar hai. shukriya."
,gaurav900,2012-07-16T04:19Z,"Yes malik saheb , movie freak bhai ne thik farmaya  ND times ki quality bahut poor hai , isliye meri aapse iltaza hai ki aapki agli film new delhi times ho !!"
