The Rajasthan Ganga Sagar Canal Project, intended to transform the states vast barren desert, was one of the Nehru governments show pieces. Shot on the canal building site, this distant echo of King Vidors Our Daily Bread (1934) endorses Indira Gandhis slogans, while deploying the developmentalrheotric and Nehruite iconography of dams, bridges and industrialisation. Ganga Singh (Agha) lives in a drought stricken village in Rajasthan and leaves his wife Gauri (Simi), sister Sonki (Chanda) and father Hari Singh (Sajjan) to dedicate himself to the canal project. He learns of the projectiva government propaganda newsreel in a touring cinema. The story intercuts Ganga Singhs struggle for progress at work with the direpre-industrial conditions at home; his father dies, his sister is rapid by the bandit Mangal Singh (Thapa) and Gauri waits for her husband to return. Ganga Singh sacrifices his life to avert a disaster at the site but eventually industrial progress triumphs and the life-givng water arrives.
