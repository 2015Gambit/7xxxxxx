Immerse is uncropped at the top but resized to mod2 (1268x720).
Rules are as follows

Resolution:                                                                |
|   - 1080i/p sources must be cropped as needed and resized to fit within     |
|     1280x720 with width=1280 and/or height=720. Never upscale, never add    |
|     borders. Resolution must be mod2.                                       |
|   - 720p sources may optionally be cropped to the nearest mod2, or may be   |
|     left at mod16

So you can either crop the black out and resize to nearest mod2, or leave the
black alone and stay with mod16 (1280x720) but they did neither.

Also, as an aside. Look at their ivtc, it's terrible. Yes part of this is due
to ABC framerape technique but part of it is also IMMERSE. Our release is from
Global which ran a minute longer and is sooooo smooth compared to IMMERSE.
IVTC comparison samples can be found in the SDX.


Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?
