Please also upload a 1080p rip of ""Atlantis the Lost Empire"", which is IMHO the greatest animated movie ever made, or at least top 3, together with ""Laputa, Castle in the Sky"" and ""Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind"". Perhaps you could also do those two. And don't be too modest with the size, everything up to 4.5gb is ok for a 1080p 2h rip. Again, thank you so much!"
