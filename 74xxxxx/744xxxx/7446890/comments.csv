,MidnightRob,2012-07-24T00:19Z,"*sigh* lol I wish It was easy to do this where I live.. Hunger games out in 25 days yet no watchable version, this is still dark as shit. It's really not worth the effort and a waste of bandwidth. I remember the days a ok version use to be out... no, not sure if new laws or what but each version of a recently released movie just blows balls.  inb4, people say well be grateful or go pay $ to see... I do,  and I buy the dvds as well.. however I don't like waiting six months. so hush and please stop releasing shit copies "
