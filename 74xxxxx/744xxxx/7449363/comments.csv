this is my malikjeebhai@yahoo.com inbox 
whats the name of movie ..............?
 Hello, Malikjee
You have been uploading some great, obscure, and rare films of which I'm a huge fan. Can you upload a good quality print of MUSAFIR (1986, Naseeruddin Shah, Rekha)? I love that movie, but can't find a decent print. Also looking for AUR KAUN? a horror film starring Sachin, that I saw as a kid.


I also have a request for an unknown film. My friend told me he saw it on Doordarshan about 20 years back or more. But he missed the title. The story is about an impoverished old couple in a desolate area. They have a son, whom they have sent away (abroad or to some city) for studies. The couple cannot make ends meet, so they resort to looting and murdering the passersby who happen to stay at their place for the night (they have a 'room for rent' or something). One day, an old friend of theirs comes to visit and asks them about their son. they say haven't heard from him in a long time. He is baffled, and and says that he just sent their son to their address a day (or two?) back, so how could they not have met him. the couple look at each other, and realize the last person they killed was their own son. They go into a room and shut the door from inside. The last shot is of the bottom of the door, with blood spilling out from underneath it.


That is more or less the plot of the film. As you can imagine, it sounded very intriguing to me, so I wanted to see the film for myself. But my friend couldn't even identify any of the cast. Do you or your film buff friends have any idea what this film might be, and could you upload it if at all possible?


Thanks in advance, please keep up the good work.


Ajmal
