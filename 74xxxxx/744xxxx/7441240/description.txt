User Review

The early Hopalong Cassidy films were generally the best & this one is no exception. Hoppy is again joined here by the young Russell "Lucky" Hayden, as they help a lady in distress manage a ranch coveted by several sagebrush ruffians. The lady initially detests Hoppy, but soon becomes enamored of the black-clad foreman.

Gabby Hayes is absent from this film, due to then on-going contract negotiations. While his presence is missed here, this film offers all the best elements of the classic Hoppy film. The action, script and casting here are superb. No one played the western hero better than William Boyd and he is at his prime here!
