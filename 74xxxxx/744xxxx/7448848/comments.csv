,Alexonion,2012-07-17T00:48Z,3GB . Damn !
,saint84,2012-07-17T13:55Z,"yep. but the bigger the file, the higher the bitrate , with a x264 compression and the better quality. plenty of small files if you don't want this one .
for my part, i will try this one and comment later . thanks tvteam. finally got it uploaded and seeded"
,saint84,2012-07-17T16:36Z,"well , in this case not. finished downloading it. and compared it to The Amazing Spiderman 2012 TS XviD AC3 Hive - CM8 . and i hate to say picture better for the latter. so this big file is good , but not as good for its size. also we see arabic subs some times harcoded. your choice "
,saint84,2012-07-17T16:38Z,latter being The Amazing Spiderman 2012 TS XviD AC3 Hive - CM8. just in case of confusion 
,donavon_bray,2012-07-18T22:07Z,But this one is the full movie. It isn't missing ten minutes.
,Horizon14,2012-07-20T11:05Z,"this one is great.  by far the best. no missing peices. great audio and video for a cam. 

except what are the ""TASM.sxx"" files for, you dont need to download them"
,kneel23,2012-07-21T07:25Z,"It says ""Enjoy No RAR releases"" yet this is 56 .rar files?"
,kneel23,2012-07-21T07:27Z,oops nevermind - I see they arent rar's - what are these other files?
,marshal_law,2012-07-23T07:33Z,a little to big for the quality don't you think. when i downloaded this i thought it was gonna be near dvd quality its like watching a 3d movie with out glasses and extra blurry but horizon14 up there says its the best so far so nice job its watchable and audio is fine not perfect jut fine  thank you 
,ChasUGC,2012-07-25T03:41Z,"After trying all the other early releases, this one is the best. It just needs some sharpening of the picture and filtering of the sound. But better than the rest of them. A=7,V=7,M=7."
