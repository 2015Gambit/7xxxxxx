Norton Internet Security: 2012 


ΓÇóNorton Internet Security 2012, just like Norton AntiVirus 2012, was engineered around the Intelligent Threat Protection concept: 

.Its core technology, the Norton Protection System, uses multiple layers of security that work together to proactively block attacks and remove threats - something that traditional virus detection methods cannot achieve.
 .In addition, all downloads, files and applications are checked before you can use them on your computer.
 .Security holes in your operating system and browser are guarded so no infections can get to you that way.
 .Your emails and Instant Messages are always scanned to detect potential threats
