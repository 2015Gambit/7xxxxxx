,Fitzy727,2012-07-16T05:16Z,"Anyone have a clue why every new 720P version of TB season 5 is around 2GB in size?  

Not complaining, just curious because most one hour shows that I download in 720P are only a gig in size."
,Jonasx,2012-07-16T08:18Z,I'm surprised this one is only 2ch sound. Previous episodes were 6ch.
