,mioteks,2012-07-19T20:33Z,How can i instal this ? Please help i will be very thankful :)
,downaccs,2012-07-20T11:01Z,"@mioteks
1.) Prepare a thumb drive
2.) Go to http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ download Universal USB Installer.exe and run the program."
,MhrBhr,2012-07-21T07:12Z,"Thanks a lot!
I used to follow you for windows xp since a very long while.
Now I will continue with windows 7 and no worry because of you.
For all who do not know much about Maherz, if you are worried about getting a latest version all the time, just drop anything else around in tpp and follow this guy.
I do not know him and he is not my friend but it is just a wonderful thing to find such a job being done each month since a very long time ago.
Thanks a lot."
,P4rtyP00per69,2012-07-21T07:40Z,"Thanks and a +1 to you.

@mioteks, burn the ISO to a disc by right clicking it on a Windows 7 computer and select Open with Windows Disc Image Burner. If you don't have a Windows 7 computer yet, use the free Microsoft's USB/DVD Download Tool (google it) so you can transfer it to either a DVD or a thumb drive. Alternatively, you can transfer it to a thumb drive using the free Universal USB Installer or the YUMI which can be found at pendrivelinux.com.

After preparing the thumb drive, boot from it and follow the menu. When done installing, run the Windows Loader to activate it if it isn't activated yet."
,P4rtyP00per69,2012-07-21T07:59Z,"Can you please combine the x64 and x86 installer into one ISO? That will be even better.

I'm also curious how to slipstream the updates. What files to you add, which folder to put them and how to run them automatically.

Thanks and a +1 to you."
,MhrBhr,2012-07-21T10:36Z,"I used to follow your torrents since a long while especially those for operating system and in particular the monthly XP ones.
Now I will continue with Windows se7en.
Thanks a lot indeed and too much appreciated.
Note:- I use it for all my needs in laptop, home, work and never regret it."
,theghostz,2012-07-21T15:39Z,is this windows 7 build 7600 or build 7601? 
[V],Maherz,2012-07-21T17:15Z,"@mioteks
Just burn the file into a DVD and boot from it.

@MhrBhr
Thanks for your trust and for your words :)
Really appreciate it.

@P4rtyP00per69
Thank you.
I don't really have time to combine both into 1 ISO.
But serach Google, I've heared that someone took my ISO's and combined them.

@theghostz
7601"

,redeemerz,2012-07-25T00:45Z,"Hello Thanks for the upload, i've read about your previous Torrents and ppl seem very happy about it, however i've got couple of questions to ask since im planning to install this windows on my new ssd.

1)Do we have to dll ourselfs the Loader?
2) Can we just update manually from windows updates or we're gonna have to gain the updates from you everymonth ?
3) Does Microsoft Security Essentials Passes the genue test.

Thanks anyway dlling and seeding."
,redeemerz,2012-07-25T02:10Z,"i cannot edit my post,  the dll just finished so i got the answer on my 1st question, looking forward to get a quick reply for the others 2. "
,LeQSG,2012-07-25T21:35Z,Seems legit but does it really work? And would it work on a 7 year old laptop? Thanks
,Robot_Z,2012-07-26T06:25Z,"Might be a dumb question, but, will this pass as genuine? So I don't have trouble with updating etc"
,smithy125,2012-07-26T11:54Z,"Thank you for the upload

This works fine on the windows up date, there only a few updates to install when you use this.

Use a loader to make it genuine.

Cheers once again for ht upload :)"
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-26T23:27Z,"Read the included instructions so you don't asking the same question 10 times people! It is not activated, you must use the included crack to keep it genuine and able to update. This is a 30day trial until you crack it. Thanks to Maherz."

,toretokka,2012-07-29T12:00Z,"Downloading now..Will comment definitely...The only problem with OS related torrents is that in the long run they develop issues as MS keep tracking and does something with the  updates that screws our machines...
I am apprehensive about 2 things
1. MS Security Essentials works or not
2. Can we update online or we need to download his torrents every time for an update and format the machine to have the latest OS.

Anyways this torrent has +23 so I am downloading it...Good luck to me..."
,smithy125,2012-07-29T14:06Z,"@toretokka never download this up update 

Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB971033)

Update type: Important

This update to Windows Activation Technologies detects activation exploits and tampering to key Windows system files. These exploits try to bypass regular Windows activation and are sometimes included within counterfeit copies of Windows.

Right click the update and hide. Thx

,edvaness,2012-07-30T07:31Z,Thanks Maherz 
,m8cet,2012-07-30T20:56Z,"@Smithy et all: Just installed the thing on my PC. I see KB971033 already on my list of Installed Updates. Since I have not gone to the internet yet, this must have come with Maherz's image. So what now? Keep it or uninstall and hide? What say guys?"
,duriotic,2012-08-02T18:02Z,"No update will make any difference (to date) if this DAZ loader is used to activate after first install.  No need to remove any updates, nor to prevent any.  It works by injecting the necessary code prior to each boot that MS would have sent anyhow to activate.  It's an old time-tested scheme by now.  Just download and enjoy."
,shadabshamsi,2012-08-05T07:40Z,"hey! I need some help...I have burned the image to a DVD and when I start the installation it does load files with a white bar as usual with description ""windows is loading files"", then shows windows logo as during booting up and then goes blank with just mouse cursor left on screen. Even when intalling in virtual machine using DVD it behaves same way however when using downloaded image file in VM it goes all well.
Please help me on what is going wrong. I will be greatfully thankful & seed it always if it works."
,toretokka,2012-08-05T11:47Z,"Hey Guys, I just want to let you know that updates are till now working fine on this version of windows 7. Its been nearly a week and I haven't found something bad. Its pretty much stable. If something comes up will update at once. So +1 from my side."
,Goldfire1986,2012-08-12T17:46Z,I can confirm what toretokka said. Been running this with automatic updates on for over a week now. Very clean and simple release. Thanks.
,XtraZoom,2012-08-14T05:25Z,Got to ask Maherz will you do the August one as well?
,cyberwalk,2012-08-17T16:11Z,"Is anyone unable to install ANY office suite ?!

Anything other than that works fine."
,cyberwalk,2012-08-17T16:24Z,I finally FOUND my problem! Please read this is you face the same : try and uninstall any updates gia did the last day. I uninstalled the 20most recent among which there were 2 problematic ones. Thank you for your share Maherz! :-)
,Robot_Z,2012-08-20T23:03Z,Do we need to keep downloading your W7 ultimate distributions that you release monthly or can we just leave it as it is?
,raj_07,2012-08-22T12:29Z,avg....says...malware..in loader...both 2.1.5 and 2.1.7....is this a false positive....plz ..reply.....
,Tovagulet,2012-08-26T01:18Z,"Thanks for keeping it updated! :)

@raj_07
It's a false positive.
WLoader has to edit the Registry and various things to activate windows, and since it edit the registry ""without your knowledge"" it will consider it a malware or virus.
Same goes for Keygens...

@Robot_Z
You don't have to keep downloading, you can munually update it with ""Windows Updates""
This is mainly for people who don't have Windows 7 and need one with the latest updates so they don't have to download all updates, and install them themselves.

,patroclus1001,2012-08-26T22:52Z,"hey, i'm a noob or a newb so i'm shaky about all this. i have genuine vista installed on my computer but i want to upgrade to windows 7. it will reformat my hard drive and get rid of everything?

Also, if someone can put up a real basic set of instructions on what to do once it's downloaded? I've never done anything this major and i don't want to screw my pc up. please."
,Stelios7xXx,2012-08-28T20:31Z,Can i download Microsoft Security Essential with this or it'll say that it's not genuine?
,Tovagulet,2012-09-02T16:38Z,"@patroclus1001
It will depend on the installation you want to do. If its only an upgrade, just put the DVD in your computer and a windows will open and just follow the instructions its really simple... and if you are not sure what to do, there are thousand of guides on how to install Windows... just use google

@Stelios7xXx
Yes you can use Microsoft Security Essentials.
You can also use Windows Updates, as it will detect it as Genuine."
,cjoct,2012-09-03T19:23Z,so what use daemon tools mount to disc restart computer insert disc then it pops up a installer for win 7 or do i have to go to setup utility or what? 
,cajunspice,2012-09-04T10:25Z,"I need some help please.  I am already running windows 7 home premium but wanted to upgrade so have downloaded this torrent, made a disc and tried to install but first it says do you want to install updates and I am not sure...then it stops and says I have to go to start and do an upgrade which asks for a key and won't go any further when I can't provide one.  Can anyone offer any advice please...new to this.  Thanks "
,duriotic,2012-09-05T20:31Z,"@cajunspice:  You need to boot from the disc you made of this.  Put it in the drive, restart your computer, and it should offer to install fresh and format your drive.  Back up your data first cuz it's gonna wipe it all clean.  Get windows loader when you're done (here from Maherz) and activate it."
