The Swinging Blue Jeans were a four piece 1960s British Merseybeat band, best
known for their hit singles with the HMV label; "Hippy Hippy Shake", the
follow-up, Little Richard's "Good Golly Miss Molly", and "You're No Good", a
Clint Ballard song that provided a change of pace and furnished the group's
most enduring achievement. But subsequent singles released that year and the
next made no impression. In 1966 their version of Burt Bacharach and Hal
David's "Don't Make Me Over" peaked at #31 in the UK Singles Chart, but the
group never charted again.

NOTE: When first ripped the studio conversation on track 5 and track 8
got attached as ending on track 4 and 7. So I had to manually set the range
in EAC and rip tracks 4, 5, 7 and 8 individually.
