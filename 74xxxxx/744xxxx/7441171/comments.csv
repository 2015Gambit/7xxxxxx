I buy a 2TB hardrive jajaja."
,bluebuury,2012-07-14T17:18Z,"YAY!!! You finally did Inception!!! Thank you so much! You are so awesome, and keep it up! 

By the way, I'm guessing that many people have already asked you this, but are you going to upload ""The Hunger Games"" when it comes out next month?"
[T],tr108,2012-07-15T04:54Z,"Yes, The Hunger Games is on the watchlist, tho I prolly won't get to it before mid-August (just sayin', in case it's leaked way early)"
,jmarsh13,2012-07-16T06:09Z,"you are really helping me fill up my new 2TB drive, i""m loving your torrents. Really allowing me to upgrade the quality on the movies I already have."
,rderossi,2012-07-16T20:45Z,"tr108, do you have a twitter showing upcoming releases and new releases you have or requests?"
,karimbaraka,2012-07-17T09:39Z,"Thanks for all your ups and I go with the idea of a twitter account or Facebook page for all your releases to keep us (your fans) updated
Thanks again man your uploads are of the best quality :)"
,karimbaraka,2012-07-17T12:43Z,"Sorry to ask but can you do "" Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 (2011) "" in 1080p please
thanks in advance :)"
[T],tr108,2012-07-17T19:41Z,"I'm glad everyone's beefing up their iTunes libraries. :)

I *might* revisit the Twilight films before the last one comes out in Nov, since my girl is a big fan (and because she puts up with me being on the computer too much, I owe her big time. lol.)

***please note***
I won't be posting much for the next month. I have a BIG project that will consume my life. I'm just giving everyone a heads up.

Upcoming schedule: (barring tech disaster)
July 24 - Matrix Trilogy
July 31 - 1st 3 Bourne films

Ups (new releases) will resume mid-August.

If you want to follow me on Twitter, it's @techrod108. No promises that I will be active on it tho."
,FabioXS,2012-08-04T16:14Z,"Thank you sooo much!!
Please don't stop posting these!

Are you thinking about doing Drive (2011)? I'll be waiting for that one :)"
