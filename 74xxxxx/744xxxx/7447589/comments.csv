""In November 2009, a four-disc set was released as the ""Ultimate Cut"".[91] This version included the director's cut of the film re-edited to contain Tales of the Black Freighter into the story as it is featured in the graphic novel, bringing the run time of the film to 215 minutes. The set also included two additional hours of bonus features including Under the Hood and The Complete Motion Comic. Originally released only on DVD, the set later became available on Blu-ray."""

,DoingYerMom,2012-07-16T19:13Z,"can i make a request?
seven pounds plz"
,catflusher,2012-07-16T20:47Z,"Malsz, I am sure YIFY will upload that as soon as there is a true bluray to be ripped and converted. YIFY does not do cams."
,sean_incali,2012-07-17T00:10Z,where's 720p?
,Applegrenade,2012-07-17T04:46Z,"Ty for this upload YIFY :D, any chance you could upload Sonic the Hedgehog 1999 ^o^"
,jack_jones_smith,2012-07-17T06:58Z,Thank you!
,rootuser4fredm,2012-07-18T03:16Z,"YIfI please understand that by tagging 1080p or 720p in your titles is a little misleading. The files are not in the least bit that of which you say. Although close to the number, of that in which you have is still considered high def, is not 1080p or 720p. Please note that the file is compressed and altered and the lines that appear (pixels) are not ""true"" HD. "
,Munchkinpuncher,2012-07-18T06:27Z,Thanks a bunch yify crew.
,luis17se,2012-07-19T07:09Z,It would be great to have your usual 720p version too. They have great quality/size ratio. Thanks a lot!
,ironymon,2012-07-21T10:40Z,"YIFY compresses it so u wouldnt see blocks. Whether it's true hd or not, who woul want to buy a 40 dollar or more bluray or download a 60-120gb movie when u can get a 3gb one with the same picture quality at proper sitting distance."
,ironymon,2012-07-21T10:43Z,"and he's not compressing, just reencoding... right?"
,stixdogg,2012-07-24T20:05Z,"@ rootuser4fredm and any other ""complainers"" .. 1080p means progressive scan and specifies a resolution. it has nothing to do with the file size or bit rate.  if you cant look at the file size and realize its going to be lower quality than an 8 GB rip or whatever then you are a fool.  YIFY makes amazing looking rips for the given size.  all the rips from YIFY are always minimum bitrate but good quality, but obviously not bluray quality.. but MUCH better than dvd.  the x.264 codec used to encode these is meant for HD quality movies, and when set up properly, can reduce the file size significantly. that is all :)"
,pinzmoo,2012-07-28T08:39Z,"@rootuser4fredm the bottom line is YIFY never uploads shit, ever. I have over 4000+ totaling around 970GBs of  movies and i check YIFY repeatedly to see if I can replace anything I have, due to most of his movies are high quality + smaller then the files I already have. its a win win dude."
,reavercraft,2012-07-29T18:49Z,A? V? M? come on guys get on the ball
,vmjyogi,2012-08-05T18:12Z,"@reavercraft.

It's YIFY, what quality do you imagine it will be?"
,eb121209,2012-08-09T01:09Z,"@Malsz,

Um, why would you ask him to upload ""Snow White And the Huntsman""? The only uploads released right now are cam's. The movie doesn't come out on DVD until September 11th so a DVD quality upload will be released around that date. Maybe at the end of August."
,PineappleStarz,2012-08-10T13:05Z,"FYI. 
you lose the amount of colours when you compress.
just think about a BMP picture saved as a JPG.
thats the difference between file sizes, thats all.
gets blocky when when all the shades of colours are not available.
"
,nolopirata22,2012-08-19T09:09Z,thank you very much!!
,Erewon,2012-08-20T22:45Z,"Very good upload, thanks !"
,TorrentRating,2012-08-29T02:04Z,"What he means here is that the resolution is 1920x800 vs ""true HD"" ie 1920x1080. This is true, but on the actual Blu-Ray the area of the screen where there is picture is only 800 pixels. The rest is a 140 pixel tall black bar on top and bottom. YIFY has removed those wasted pixels to save on bandwidth. So yeah it's not truly a full 1080p frame but none of the actual picture has been lost. I personally found the quality here to be excellent on 50"" screen from 6-7ft. For the size of the file, unbeatable.

,TRM219,2012-08-29T17:58Z,"How come none of your uploads offer 6 channel audio? They would be the best online ... I always avoid your uploads because of this, though the quality is always good. :( 

Any time in the future maybe?"
,hljott,2012-09-05T20:36Z,"The audio throughout this movie can get god awful at times. Multiple times I've had to max out the volume on my TV, and I can still hear nothing of what they're saying."
