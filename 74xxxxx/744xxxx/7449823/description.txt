In 2004, Thomas Jane starred in Lionsgate's The Punisher. Eight years later, the actor is back as Frank Castle in the short film The Punsher: Dirty Laundry, that made its debut Saturday night at San Diego Comic-Con. It also stars Ron Perlman, and was directed by Phil Joanou. 

"I wanted to make a fan film for a character I've always loved and believed in - a love letter to Frank Castle & his fans. It was an incredible experience with everyone on the project throwing in their time just for the fun of it. It's been a blast to be a part of from start to finish -- we hope the friends of Frank enjoy watching it as much as we did making it." -- Thomas Jane
