,J-RedtheRed,2012-07-17T00:31Z,I never stopped seeding. I guess im the one seeder idk. half the things i upload say 0 seeders even tho they r seeding in BitTorrent
,TANK32,2012-07-27T06:19Z,Seed please
,titanmatrix,2012-07-31T05:05Z,Can the uploader actually seed this thing?  It's a little frustrating...
,GIGABITT,2012-09-01T03:16Z,This is a waste of time here folks. Dip $#*t here hasn't got the message yet that his download isn't working. Word of advise J-RedtheRed...Not everyone is using bit torrent when there is better ways to upload with less ads and viruses. Wake up.
