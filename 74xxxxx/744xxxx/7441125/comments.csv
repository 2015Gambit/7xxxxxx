Run a search before uploading it is that easy."

You are a fool?"
,aarque,2012-07-16T12:49Z,It is a violation of Pirate Bay rules to duplicate your own torrents and an offense to duplicate the torrents of other pirates. Your question is negative as it is you who are the fool.

No you're not a fool, you're a real idiot!

Compare these torrents. Portuguese torrent requires many corrections and ""thicker"" (114%)."
,aarque,2012-07-16T16:46Z,"Ach I feel so stupid. I didnt realize you actually copied his exact torrent, then ran it through your hacker Russian chernobylware -  Chelyabinsk, best know as the hub for the trans-Siberian railway.

They still have dial-up over there in ""East Europe,"" I am guessing. Cutting 190 megabytes saves me the better part of an hour, maybe, but I got a crappy 1.5 meg up here in lawless America. So, not sure what your point is..your torrent is somehow better?"
,aarque,2012-07-16T16:49Z,"ya no really, my bad. Go for it, still not sure the point, but...could be a lot worse. Sorry I ripped you, Ruskie dude."
,xxtsh,2012-07-16T18:00Z,Nu tupye! :)

Well, my torrent, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7413285/FSX_Mirage_2000_-5_Rollus,  is 100% clean of any viruses or malware, and it's super easy to install, as described, and I'm sharing with all my upload speed unblocked (40mbps). 

Try to post something people wants, instead stealing another person's torrent.

Say goodbye to your re-post."
,alcluizPT,2012-07-18T04:24Z,"aarque, it's ok, as a moderator on Suprbay said, he's    just a torrent whore, trying to gain credit for someone elses work

,alcluizPT,2012-07-18T04:27Z,"Torrent Whore 

A Torrent Whore is a BitTorrent user , who is too lazy to upload his own content, so they opt to download a torrent from another user, and use those contents to create another torrent upload in their user name. 

Definition (Extended): 

Instead of creating their own rips, Torrent Whores merely download other people stuff, rename it and post it again as their own. It is sad, since it generates a lot of unneeded duplicates, instead of allowing larger swarms to develop around a single posting. 

They are never going to give credit where it is due, since the folks who do this are trying to make themselves into bigshot uploaders without bothering to put in any real effort.

guy1: Dude, some just uploaded your comic in their name ! 

guy2: WTF ?! That dude is a torrent whore !"

Ha ha, you made ââme laugh :)

I have no time for you my friend. I play the balalaika and drinking vodka with the bears. :)))"
,alcluizPT,2012-07-20T04:55Z,"I wouldn't download this garbage.
It's a .exe and can carry lots of other stuff.
I'd go with the old and good RAR:
