Nurturing mom Vanna has always had a soft spot for son Xander's best friend, Dane. So when Xander asks if Dane can visit during winter break, Vanna eagerly agrees. But when Dane arrives from college it's clear he's matured from boy to man, and Vanna finds herself feeling more than just "motherly love." Meanwhile, Dane can't deny his attraction to the gorgeous older woman who helped raise him. Will Xander and sister Zoe discover the secret that threatens to tear their family apart?
