                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Beauty and the Beast: The Ugly Face of Prejudice explores how nine out of ten women 
 in the United Kingdom are unhappy with their appearance and how over half of those 
 would have surgery to change the way they look and how almost three quarters of Brits 
 think that being better looking would make them more successful in their lives. Each 
 week the series brings together two people who are defined by the way they look but 
 approach things from very different sides. 

                                 Enjoy!
