Avast Pro 7 with Key File (till Feb 2013)

Security Benefits:

Customize Your Security for Your Needs

Tailor your antivirus software the way that best fits your personal computing habits. Pro Antivirus offers simple controls for keeping yourself virus-free in 2012.

DonΓÇÖt Lose Your Game

Silent gaming mode means you can play (or surf) without interruption. Pro Antivirus works silently in the background when you want it to, without notifications or changes to system performance.

Shop and bank online without worry

SafeZone creates a private and isolated virtual window on your desktop for safely making your sensitive financial transactions when shopping or banking online.

Surf and socialize without annoyance

Sandbox lets you surf the web and run programs virtually (outside your PC), and Web, IM, and P2P shields ensure your safety on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), IM chats (Skype, ICQ, etc.), or file-sharing sites.

Benefit from real-time protection

Hybrid cloud technology streams your virus database updates to your PC in real-time, so your avast! software has all virus definitions as soon as they are known to our Virus Lab.

Know whatΓÇÖs coming before you click

Our cloud-based FileRep feature keeps reputation data on countless files, using select criteria (such as prevalence and emergence) for determining risks ΓÇô so we can warn you of a fileΓÇÖs reputation beforehand.

See your avast! history

Your AVAST Account portal is your personal directory for all your avast! related 
data. Each month, we also prepare for you a Security Report that shows an overview of the most significant details (e.g. number of infected sites blocked).

Get help from a ΓÇÿGeekΓÇÖ in your network

Our new Remote Assistance lets you initiate remote support from a family member or friend who agrees to help. Initiated by you, it routes through AVASTΓÇÖs servers, bypasses firewalls, and can be terminated by you at any time.
