didnt like seeing them big boarders for the
first 34mins soo chopped nd cropped no biggie
didnt really lose any picture doin it, altered
rgb, gamma, contrast, levels, sat, denoisers,
colour balance etc altered AR aswell for better
viewing, nice and smooth without breaking the
sharpness overall a decent cam V - 8, A - 9 IMO

Note2: if you got a good eye u'll proply

plus there is a bottom boarder for the
first 2mins & for 40secs at the 34min mark
