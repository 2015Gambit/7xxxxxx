Meiko Discography - July 2012

- 2008 (Self-titled) and 2012 (The Bright Side) albums and remix singles included.
- The 2007 (self-titled) album was not included, primarily because it was a self-release, and the same songs were recorded with higher quality for the 2008 release under Lucky Ear/MySpace/DGC.
- MP3 quality is a mix of 320kbps CBR and 256kbps VBR, track normalized to 96dB - these were the highest quality I could find so far.
- Album covers embedded in all music files.
- Remixes for "Leave the Lights On" taken from Meiko remix context website and SoundCloud, gracias to those who posted remixes on the Interwebs.
