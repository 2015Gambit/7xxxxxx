,Breezeycouk,2012-08-09T18:47Z,"Great RIP - Having problems installing though.

Have burnt all 3 discs - See the crack folder on disc 1.  Install starts then asks for Key.

All XXX's doesn't work - nor do any of the other keys listed or my original one (Bought game but now disc scratched and can't install on new PC)

When running crack exe says I am missing a dll file - Can't copy it to install folder as install folder doesn't seem to exist yet ?  (Have done a root search of C:/ )

I'm Win7 if that helps in away?

Hope some one can help !!!!"

This is a public cd key so you cannot play multiplayer. Unless you get a real cd key, you'll be able to play it"
