A ransom scheme turns into a nightmare for a group of kidnappers who become 
victims of a horrifying secret that must be paid every spring

This movie looks pretty awesome. Much like all of the IFC screeners, the black 
bars have been cropped, and part of the "Do Not Duplicate" can be seen on the video. The nag isn't on the screen for the whole movie, it just pops up a few times. A reencoder says what?
AXED! We do this better
