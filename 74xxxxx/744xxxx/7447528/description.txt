         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Episode  Summary      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Wes and Travis gain a new best friend when a K-9 officer who Travis once dated 
gives him temporary custody of her police dog, Hudson, after she is shot during 
a sting gone wrong. Travis is excited at the prospect of having a pooch around, 
but as Wes points out, responsibility isn't Travis's strong suit.

Sure enough, when Hudson gets in the way of date night, Travis pawns the dog off
on the canine-averse Wes for the evening. However, Wes quickly takes a liking to
Hudson and refuses to give him back, leading Dr. Ryan to propose a compromise: 
Travis takes Hudson during the day, while Wes will take him at night. As with 
any good compromise, neither party is happy.
