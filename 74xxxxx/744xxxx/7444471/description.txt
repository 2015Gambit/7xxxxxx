This time Max and Stacy discuss the mainstream media joining the 'hang bankers' bandwagon, as it becomes increasingly obvious that the space race has been replaced with a fraud race and getting your Series 7 broker's license makes stealing a risk-free business proposition. In the second half of the show, Max talks to analyst and newslettter writer, Rob Kirby of Kirby Analytics, about the derivatives complex as a price control grid and about the fact that every time the JP Morgan monster needs a feeding, something must die.
