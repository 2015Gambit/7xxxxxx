***NOTICE***
Troll's stay clear: I bought the CD, I purchased dBpoweramp to rip, I verified meta information, Checked the disk against accurate rip. I am sharing my collecting to grow the FLAC collection out there for my fellow audiophiles.
I am currently living in the Philippines and that is where I am upping from so sorry if the upspeed isnt FANTASTIC and IF it happens to drop sometimes. 
Seed if you like the torrent, and even better support the artist that you enjoy listening to!

Oh and for those who will say "I hate flac" please see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC
