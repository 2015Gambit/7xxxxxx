 i'd love to be a valuable member on this site by seeding what i torrent."
,marcol000,2012-07-17T00:43Z,@mcboils: It depends on the setting you have on your BT client. You can set it to seed indefinitely or let it stop once it's reached a certain ratio.
,mcboils,2012-07-17T01:02Z,"kay, thanks one more thing. the info on this torrent still says 0 seeders. will it not count until it hits that ratio you spoke of?"
