,Dimmis80,2012-07-16T18:36Z,"""YES-YES-YES-YES-YES""...LOL..That yes guy is just a nut case just a very mediocre wrestrel and i would love just love to see the ""Best in the World"" CM Punk to kick the hell of him..AJ girl we all know that u have a thing for CMPUNK..Do your thing.But i don't think that the ""Best in the world"" needs your help.You know my friend scene4all i don't know how u do it but without your work and dedication we will be without those crazy dudes we love.The quality of your uploads are far better from anyone else.God bless u mate.With that shows u make my day.I laugh and laugh with these guys and the most of them puts a good show.Some say that all is just fake or that they fight ok but its not like Box or something or the stories are lame and stuff.And i have an answer.If u or anyone have fun and a good time who cares what is realy happening.Every fun like me with a litle help of his imagination have more fun and even better good time.And finaly mr Big Show is time to pay for your sins..Have fun guys."
