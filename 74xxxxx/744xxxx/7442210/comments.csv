Would someone please seed this torrent? 39+ people stuck at 87%.

Thank-you."
,bubbanuggzz,2012-07-16T05:49Z,they are a release group.its a good chance that which ever one of them put this up stoped seeding it before anyone finished downloading it for re-seed.I already got rid of it cuz I started dl'ing it 10mins after it got up'd & been stuck at 87% for three days.not worth it any more
