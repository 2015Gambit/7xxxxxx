I was just interested in the main movie so I used DVDFab v8.1.9.0, Blu-ray Copy, Main Movie, 1st English audio track and no subs. Selected Target (saved to hdd), dragged this folder to DVDFab, then, ran DVDFab. I ended up with a single M2TS @20.40GB

I hope this is helpful.

AND, AGAIN, THANKS FOR THIS GREAT TORRENT!
