Solution Manuals (Students+Instructors) would be very useful."
[V],dynstab2,2012-07-15T13:18Z,"You are absolutely right. The torrent name incorrectly reads ""9th"" and the description correctly reads ""5th"" for Elements. The name of the file also reads correctly. [Babysitting 5 by a pool on a scorcher almost got all my attention]

Atkins:

Physical Chem 9th, 972 pages (posted July 2nd)  FLAGSHIP
Elements of Physical Chem 5th, 578 pages (posted yesterday)
Chemical Principles 5th (coming soon)"

Note: Please keep the file extension (.7z/pdf/.rar) in your uploads."
[V],dynstab2,2012-07-16T13:41Z,"The sure way to know the format in which the file is uploaded is to click on the number (in blue) appearing in the ""Files: "" field at the top of the description. This is particularly useful when the small .torrent file isn't available, usually when there are more than 10 peers on TPB, with only the magnet available (the magnet will reveal the format only once the download has started)."
,SectorVector,2012-07-16T17:41Z,right. looks like its a problem with my client. i used a different client and it was a-okay. case closed.
