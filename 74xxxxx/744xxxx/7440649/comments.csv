,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-08-22T18:08Z,"I recognise about 3 songs on this entire compilation. Who the hell are all these bands, and which rock am I apparently living under..?

Oh wait a second, I'm not living under a rock at all, I just have taste in music and wouldn't be caught dead listening to Justin Bieber or Usher."
,thenaughtons,2012-08-28T20:54Z,"Awesome!!!

thank you theLEAK"
,history4u2,2012-09-15T16:46Z,"Great album! Thank you LEAK!! :-) 

BaronVonWatermelon: Why bother commenting? If you don't like this music, go look for Beach Boys, Chuck Berry, or whatever you listened to when you were young..like forever ago :-)"
