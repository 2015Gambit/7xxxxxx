The injured crew members on the small boats return to the Steve Irwin after which they see the doctor. Meanwhile, the Bob Barker begins searching for the Nisshin Maru. They notice a dot on the radar. Believed that it is a harpoon vessel judging from the speed, they cautiously approach the target hoping it would lead them to the whaling fleet. The plan fails when the ship turns out to be a fishing boat. 

A helicopter is sent to aid the search. The Sea Shepherds are worried when they lose contact with the helicopter on its return flight. After 25 tense minutes, they are able to reestablish communication with the pilot. The crew on the Steve Irwin have a meeting to rethink their strategy. 

Paul Watson decides to send all 3 small boats and a jet ski to engage the YΓö╝┬╜shin Maru No. 2. The jet ski is used as a distraction while the small boats deploy prop foulers. After most prop foulers fail to work, they deploy the last prop fouler made out of Kevlar. It works when the YΓö╝┬╜shin is dead in the water.
