V - 10

Although captured from a TV, looks exactly like how season 4 bluray 720p did."

,sputnikwood,2012-07-16T14:09Z,"Nit picking here:

Video quality isn't the best. There are quite a bit of pixelation and artifacts but it doesnt distract from viewing too much. 7.5/10

Audio is good, first time viewing breaking bad with 5.1.  9/10.

I do wish however for next and future episodes that you guys keep the credits and not edit it out. The credits always have some cool music at the end."
,smegma123,2012-07-16T15:14Z,The video portion of the original broadcast itself isn't all that great. AMC just doesn't have their shit together. This is as good as it gets until the Blu Ray comes out. Thanks Dibya.
,Gh057man,2012-07-16T18:38Z,"Agreed ...on a 50"" screen video is hardly bd quality - sometimes marginally better than dvd quality but often worse - so I give it a 6.5. Yousefak - in future make sure any uploaded video you rate is watched with your bi-focals the right way up, and on a decent size screen - perhaps then you won't end up posting such absolute twaddle.

,zapeterset,2012-07-18T16:22Z,"Video isnÂ´t so good. I guess it depends on how you define HD but this video is full of disctracting artifacts and pixels if you want to watch it fullscreen.

Thanks to the ripper and uploader anyway, of course, but IÂ´m going to look for another version out there."
,zapeterset,2012-07-18T17:41Z,"This version has way better video:

,tomaattikasa,2012-07-25T20:34Z,"@yousefak: You have to be blind. Video quality on this release is nothing like a BR-rip. Quality of this rip is worse than many DVD:s. Don't bother to download, you'll get the same quality with the 300MB rips.
