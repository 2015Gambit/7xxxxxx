,macomaniac,2012-07-14T18:39Z,"Hi sergio_ssa! 

Download LittleSnitch here (if you don't have the app.) : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7167473/Little_Snitch_v._2.5.1_with_%5BK%5Drack

Install the app. Then install Parallels Desktop from the file downloaded here. Don't launch the app. yet! Launch LittleSnitch, select 'Rules', 'New rule'. In the window that opens, check : 'Deny connections' ; in 'Applications menu bar', go to 'Choose Application', select : 'Parallels Desktop' ; following menu bars, select : Server 'Any Server', Port 'any', Protocol 'any'. Check 'Enabled' and click 'OK'. You are ready.

Launch Parallels Desktop, and use the crack method given. Done. Be careful about updates."

,hagain,2012-08-03T04:31Z,"soooo, I downloaded the torrent (AMAZING speed by the way - thnx seeders) and unzipped with no problems. disabled gatekeeper and everything... but when I try to open the keygen, or the install file within the .dmg, or any app that came from this torrent, the dock jerks (the app's icon doesn't even appear) and nothing happens...
when I downloaded the trial version's .dmg (just to test if it opens), the install app opened with no problems...
also tried to download an other app from a torrent (used vmware's keygen and install file) to test if I have a problem with the gatekeeper, and the files opened and installed without a hitch..
any ideas as to how to get it to work?
please, any help will be greatly appreciated as I use parallels on an almost daily basis...

I have an early 2008 macbook pro, running os 10.8 (newly upgraded)."
,zoommooz,2012-08-07T20:00Z,"openarena thx for the seed. I had already downloaded a TRIAL version of parallels and then close it. I ran Little snitch and followed the instructions by macomaniac and it still says trial version. I cannot seem to find the ""Crack"" or serial gen for this. What did I miss ? 

I also tried downloading the torrent here and got a page not found error. What did I miss ? Would sure appreciate help"
