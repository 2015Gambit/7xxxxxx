Iris is an innovative sampling re-synthesizer that frees you to create sounds that could never before be produced. Start by dissecting up to three distinctive audio samples, using Iris╩╝s spectrogram display and easy selection tools to spotlight the most interesting spectral characteristics. Blend and layer your modi∩¼üed samples, then beef up their impact with a choice of suboscillator waveforms.

KEY FEATURES
Discover what's inside any sound: Load audio into Iris and explore spectral details that a regular waveform locks away.
Highlight what intrigues you: Extract and isolate the most interesting sonic components with a full suite of visual selection tools.
Combine the unthinkable: Layer completely diverse sound sources into totally unique combinations... what do a tattoo needle and a swamp bird and a slot machine sound like together?
Stay musical: Rely on intelligent root note detection to help shape musical material from noise, ambient textures, soundscapes... even mistakes!
