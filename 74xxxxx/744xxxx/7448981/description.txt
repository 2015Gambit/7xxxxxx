Love Me Or Leave Me combines hilarious comedy, true-to-life drama and rousing song
 that underscore the plays themes of responsibility and forgiveness. 
Cynthia Wyatt (Evans) is a troubled teen who abandons her fraternal twin infants, 
leaving her mother (Murdock) to raise the children. Now, 20 years later, one of 
the twins (Neal) is an attorney set to marry the man of her dreams (Keyes); the 
other (Payne) is an unemployed man-child. Both have issues. When Cynthia returns 
out of the blue, hoping to reclaim her place in their lives, no one is spared the
 soul-searching that ensues.
