Composer and cellist Ernst Reijseger has written and recorded for Werner Herzog's ┬╗Cave Of Forgotten Dreams┬½ a new soundtrack. Herzog made a documentary which is a wonderful portrait of the cave art discovered at Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc in France. These paintings are achingly beautiful, and when Herzog's camera glides along the cave walls, accompanied by the music of cellist Ernst Reijseger, it's impossible not to be moved and awed.
