,fadetonoir,2012-07-21T02:06Z,Smellynoob you inconsiderate douche...
,Bluemartian,2012-07-21T21:52Z,"WTH this movie's been out two days and there's no fucking torrents. Take your thumbs out of your butts and put them on the record button. Shit.

You'd think for a movie like this people would be so enthusiastic to share it that there would actually be LEAKS. But no that's not the case. Fucking Americans"
,hikowolf,2012-07-21T23:19Z,@smellynoob - lol you have something wrong.  What an idiot.  Was the movie too complex for you?
,tails-4,2012-07-22T05:43Z,"@smellynoob - such a dick... if we comment on this enough, itll get bumped back a page"
,tails-4,2012-07-22T05:44Z,"@bluemartian - calm the fuck down, if you actually want to see the movie, go and see it at a fucking cinema. pay for your ticket and support the industry.
don't sit on your ass at home and complain that no one has pirated it yet. "

,thehabs24,2012-07-22T15:19Z,"@smellynoob , your a fucking retarded kunt ... dont let this guy ruin the movie for you , go and see it it's epic.  Thanks for the upload"
,tutusingh,2012-07-23T05:20Z,just came back after seeing batman for the second time.. this movie was too nice.. i now personally think that Bane is much better a villain than the Joker.. Joker was all smarts.. Bane is sheer strength mixed in with a good amount of smartness..

,megat0sh,2012-08-10T05:50Z,Thank you for the great rip. I ended up converting mine to AAC which did make it a 256 VBR but dropped the size a little bit. I appreciate everything being labeled properly. I hate getting a download with everything all fucked up. Keep up the good work. And thank you to all the seeders!
