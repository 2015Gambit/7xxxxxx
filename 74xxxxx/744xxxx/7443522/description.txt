A lot ofpeople get 'hooked' and mislead into believing things are important thataren't.
Case in point.....
For whatever reason, somewhere along the line, you started to tell yourselfthat making the sale is not a priority.

"It will come..." you say to yourself.
Well, here's the truth that comes along with that.
Your paycheck will wait, too.

This misinformation that MANY people start convincing themselves of leads towhat I like to call....
'Business Destruction'

....which then breeds the need to call in the 'Business Red Cross' -
and that's when you go out and catch 'guru groupie' fever and buy another courseon 'mindset' or 'procrastination' - thus sending you into more debt and stillchasing the same dragon.

Which is - the sale.
It all leads back to that.

Look....
Learn to make the sale and this won't be a recurring problem in your business.
Ignore it....
...and you'll become another statistic on the marketing 'faceplant' list.
I'm just keeping it real :)

Solution:
Either go out and learn....

- Presentation skills
- Persuasive selling language
- Communication leverage tactics
- Hypnotic language patterns

....and a whole slew of other time consuming stuff you really don't want tobother with (if you're honest).

Or just use this, and only focus on 1 thing.
Sure beats the alternative .....any day.
At least 18,563 other people think so :)
