Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Tuesday, July 3 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee about H.R. 3608, the Stop TSA's Reach In Policy (STRIP) Act, which would prohibit any TSA employee not trained as a federal law enforcement officer or eligible for federal law enforcement benefits from wearing law enforcement uniforms or wearing a police-like metal badge. She will also talk about her report detailing the startling criminality of TSA employees. 

Alex also talks with Rosa Koire, a forensic commercial real estate appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation and an outspoken activist opposed to the United Nations' Agenda 21 and its attempts to attack civilization through so-called Sustainable Development. She is the author of Behind The Green Mask: U.N. Agenda 21, available at the Infowars Store. 

Alex also confronts the latest news, including Obamacare developments and ongoing war preparations in the Middle East.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
