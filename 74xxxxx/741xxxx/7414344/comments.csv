,Avengers1,2012-07-05T07:44Z,Thank you
,homie_j,2012-07-05T08:19Z,"@govermint    They are two DIFFERENT people releasing two DIFFERENT video formats and quality. That is like saying, Hey GMC/Chevy, why don't you combine with Ford and make just one car/truck? They are different formats and quality. If you are too stubborn/ ignorant to understand that, you deserve to be a drone standing in line at the Apple store. "
,iHerpDerp,2012-07-05T08:53Z,"@govermint

You obviously don't understand the work these guys go through to release these gems ON THE SAME DAY as they air."
,Odie4554,2012-07-05T12:58Z,"@iHerpDerp no they don't upload it the same day as the air.This was uploaded at 07(month)-05(day) today and the air date was at 07(month)-04(day) 
check wiki"
,govermint,2012-07-05T13:24Z,"You people get so pissed and defensive when anybody says anything about formats or anything, its always instant go fuck yourself, defensive line, defensive line, the same line everybody says, Now whos the drone now? the thousand people who deem is necessary to flame people on these comments, everyday about the same old bullshit.

They don't go through that much work, record a television show, cut out the commercials and sometimes the credits, and go to a bunch of websites, and click upload. Video editing is one of the easiest things in the world to do, and uploading something, a click of a button. 

Yeah so i made a mistake there two different x264 formats, there still x264 though theres like 5 different formats of a show uploaded, look at all that wasted time and effort, if people stick with two video formats .avi and .mp4(like they were doing just a few months ago before everything got all fucked), everything would be nice and easy for everybody, now thats period end of story, and your all gonna hate on me for the truth.

But what does it really matter theres only about a 30% population of decently smart people who think before they type on this website, ignore this if your just gonna be an example."

no one got defensive, no one got pissed, and no one flamed you. you asked a question and got an answer.

And you should take your own advice.

Instead of Complaining, do it yourself its so easy. That way you can upload the file extension of your choosing. No more complaining."

STFU torrent works fine..."
,waZapops,2012-07-07T16:55Z,"who gives a shit what format it is? its not like everything about the videos is already the same, no need for a library of videos with perfect names and matching resolutions. just use a folder system like videos"
,Leolus109,2012-07-08T03:20Z,"@albertrm:
Don't click the banner ads that say ""Download"" and ""Play Now""; they're put up by people who make money by tricking people. Click ""GET THIS TORRENT"" to 'download' the correct file.
