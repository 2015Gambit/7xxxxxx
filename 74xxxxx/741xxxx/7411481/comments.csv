Install Trial . Start It Once

Den Patch 
And Start Again "

1) Run ""Set-up [EC].exe"" From Adobe Photoshop CS6 Folder 

2)After Installation Just Close Photoshop And All Processes Related To It 

3) Run ""Patch For Adobe Photoshop CS6 [EC].EXE"" From Folder And It Should Show Patch Done 

For THose Who Dont Read Instructions !

,FynnRasta,2012-07-05T13:00Z,"I did what Instruction said but when I run Adobe photoshop cs6 it says ( Licensing for this product has expired).

I tried to run the other Adobe PS CS6

the loading says Superstition Beta.

what do you think ?"
[T],EvilCraze,2012-07-05T13:35Z,"@FynnRasta

You got it right . Thats the patched one :) "
,sheriar,2012-07-05T15:09Z,"I exactly followed the installation and patch-running instructions. It installed fine but won't open ... just keeps giving me the msg "" Licensing for this product has expired"".

What do I do? Pls help. Thks "
,sheriar,2012-07-05T15:14Z,"I followed the full instructions correctly for the installation and the patch, yet it won't work. When I try to open it, I only get the message  ""License for this product has expired""."

Open The Shotcut  Which Says ""Adobe Photoshop ""
And Not The 64 Bit Version "
,sheriar,2012-07-05T16:12Z,Thks EvilCraze. That did work. But this opens the 32bit version. How can I open the 64bit ver? as I am running Win7 64bit and want to take full advantage of it.
[T],EvilCraze,2012-07-05T22:46Z,"@sheriar
No matter whichever you open . Both have same functionality."
,sheriar,2012-07-06T05:12Z,Ok thanks. But I assume I can use only the 32 bit version? .... as that's the only one that opens
,Kiriyama87,2012-07-06T16:01Z,"Tried to install 2 times now, following instructions.

,Kiriyama87,2012-07-06T18:57Z,"@EvilCraze

I do have win7 on a cd. Just that this is my work computer, and I like the old XP more for some reason. Another torrent of PS CS6 says it works with XP, that's just why i wondered. But thanks for answearing me :)"

Hope It Works  For You"
,K_nakamura,2012-07-06T21:38Z,"@EC
I downloaded 3 torrents of ps cs6, even the trial from adobe using the download manager, all of them are extended but each software lack some filters and some liquify functions as well, im not sure if adobe remove the missing features, maybe there are not present because it needs a serial number.
before i download and seed this could you tell me if this torrent has those missing pieces?
thank you"
,brettban86,2012-07-07T14:07Z,"@EvilCraze

Thanks a bunch for the upload, EC. However it looks like it is a Beta version of CS6. Is it a Beta version of CS6?"
,Peter_Patong,2012-07-07T17:49Z,I can not even install it. Clicking TRY and it directs me to a login page. How do i get past from there? And i can not find any license number nigher for a normal installation.
[T],EvilCraze,2012-07-07T18:12Z,"@Peter_Patong

Although Im worried, It told me I had to get an adobe online account in order to install, which I did. I registered and now Im worried that they might monitor how long I keep this software.

Could they do that?"
