GAME iNFO ::.

This galaxy is ancient, and its first intelligent life was
the civilization we call the Endless. Long before our eyes gazed
upon the stars they flew between them, though all that remains
of this people is what we call Dust. A substance found scattered
or in forgotten temples, it once gave powers to admirals and
galactic governors. The galaxy will belong to the faction that
