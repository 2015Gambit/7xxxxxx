,jankula,2012-07-06T11:42Z,Thx a lot!
,michas123,2012-07-06T13:29Z,"I've launched the game, but after this sponsor animations I'm stuck with Endless Space logo. what's wrong?"
,Ind0,2012-07-06T14:21Z,"Works perfectly!

However: To the DarkNight Templars (Crackers); Please include a mute button in your installer next time. Shocked the hell out of me because I was watching something else on a different volume level..Good song though. xD"
,michas123,2012-07-06T15:21Z,Ind0. Game works? or just installer?
,zokolad,2012-07-06T15:23Z,"This is so similar to ""Sins of a solar empire: Rebellion""."
,artdekdok,2012-07-06T18:21Z,"Sins of a solar empire = RTS
Endless Space = TBS"
,SergioFCPorto,2012-07-06T19:24Z,thanks
,Ind0,2012-07-06T19:42Z,"@ michas,

Both work perfectly. No crack or anything required, just start the game. In case you can't start the game, you probably need to install new video drivers, or check the 'redist' folder in your game installation for additional drivers (PhysX, directX etc)"
,karlosss999,2012-07-06T21:42Z,"This is a Good Sci-fi TBS.
No doubt the torrent is clean.
Wont be touching this torrent thou, Bought it on steam while it was on alpha, don't regret it.
Word to the wise, This game is NOT made by any mega-corp. You like it - then go support the devs, its not that expensive. And they deserve it. (for not putting in any devilish DRM at least...)"
,Deimos91,2012-07-06T22:47Z,"There are still a few features that aren't in the game yet so can this get the updates automatically or are we locked out because we're not using Steam.

Here's the parts that aren't finished:

,-darkangl-,2012-07-07T01:47Z,Tried setting up a private multiplayer game and it just crashes every time.  Anyone else have this problem?
,VladMarx,2012-07-07T02:40Z,"This game is so awesome, after 15 mins of playing I bought it on steam."
,macfly59,2012-07-07T07:36Z,thanks its only us or multi ?
,ne0lit,2012-07-07T08:45Z,for the guys with problem with the % and Title things and when you cant start a game just simply move the game folder in other folder like if it was D:GamesEndless space move it to D:Endless Space it worked for me!
,oscarmike123,2012-07-07T08:53Z,"@ michas
i had the same problem, install the DX and VC from the redist folder as the guys suggested
and after you see the game logo screen hit F1.
That one worked for me - after that you see the  main menu. "
,Dark Flame,2012-07-07T12:38Z,"Thanks oscarmike123.
Works for me."

,thxforthehelp2,2012-07-08T06:00Z,"The song that plays during installation is ""I remember"" by Kaskade also good clean install and torrent thanks!"

,shadark69,2012-07-08T16:00Z,"Quick and easy install, the song was nice (but a mute option would be wonderful in case people are watching semething else), but I do have one problem. Whenever the game starts I don't see the actual names on the options you can press. All I see is %descriptionofkey etc. it makes it really hard to look through everything. Is there any solution to this? Oh and I did try the *rename the folder* like someone suggested, and it didn't help."
,laggo123,2012-07-08T17:50Z,"about the %%

please help"
,lordvahid,2012-07-08T19:41Z,virus scanner is reading this off as a trojan.... the setup.exe at least can some1 else confirm this?
,heyitscrake,2012-07-09T00:28Z,"i scanned all files with both malwarebytes and norton. no malware detected.

after opening setup.exe though with norton running it was classified as ""possible"" risk level 1 malware (specifically the skinh_el.dll file) but generally norton is really really overzealous when it comes to .exes. 

i have downloaded torrents from heromaster & REVOLT before and have encountered very few issues, so i think it's most likely a false positive lordvahsid =)"
,Irishramb,2012-07-09T02:53Z,@lordvahid I have been playing for a few days now and have encountered no issues at all :) Great torrent. Installing was really easy. Definitely buying this very soon. It's a great game.
,onett_home,2012-07-09T03:53Z,"awesome upload, boring game"

,edum11,2012-07-09T23:53Z,"I have installed it, no problem. But I the game gets stuck at the opening screen, the one with Endless Space written. Any ideas?"
,CenturionAlpha4,2012-07-10T03:19Z,Trojan detected when running exe.
,shadark69,2012-07-11T14:12Z,No one has a solution to the % issue that some of us have? =(
,shadark69,2012-07-11T22:16Z,"Found the solution to the % problem. If you let the game install itself into the folder it suggest to begin with then it wont happen. I really don't have a clue as to why changing the installation folder would fuck it up, but at least now the problem can be easily fixed if it happens for you."
,nt.D,2012-07-11T23:10Z,"If your game has stopped on the initial screen, try to uninstall EVERY version of Microsoft Virtual C++ and then install ""vcredist_x86.exe"" (from 'redist' folder. It should work now (hopefully)"
,LaNGY101,2012-07-12T04:20Z,"Good installer song, old skwl :)
This is my first time downloading a torret PC game. The install is simple but im stuck on on the main logo as others are. Some ppl are refering to redist folder, but i cant find it in the game folders or searching the comp? Help for a newbie plz"
,LaNGY101,2012-07-13T09:01Z,"@ nt.D

Ended up finding Redist folder. Did what you said by removing all Microsoft Visual C++ and then installing vcredist_x86.exe, but to no avail still stuck on the logo screen

Anymore ideas?"
,BOCTILIAN,2012-07-13T14:24Z,"When I tried to install the game, my norton found it as a medium risk.  Because of this it deleted the file..."
,nt.D,2012-07-13T15:25Z,"@LaNGY101

I'm sorry to hear that. I had this problem for 2 days and uninstalling all the Visual C++ and install it from the ""Redist"" just helped me completely. Maybe your antivirus / firewall does not allow you to start the game?

I ran out of ideas...

sorry for my english, it's not mt primary language."
,Dabeast42,2012-07-18T09:35Z,Thanks a lot it works great and I can't wait to see what future updates will bring!

,m3my,2012-07-21T15:37Z,"It seems Skidrow update 1.0.9 is working on this release. Just use it like on skidrow rls, than start game with launcher. Working for me."
,doodeyfoodle,2012-07-21T19:58Z,After installation whenever I try to run the .exe to start the game I get a full black screen that locks up my computer and requires a hard reset. Same thing happened with the other Endless Space REVOLT copy that comes bundled with the 1.09 update. Does anyone know a solution to this black screen?
,doodeyfoodle,2012-07-22T05:24Z,"UPDATE TO PREVIOUS COMMENT: Figured it out for myself. I tried installing all the .exe files from the ""redist"" subfolder of the game's directory. I also tried allowing administrator rights when executing the game launch .exe. What worked for me was disabling Comodo Firewall and then starting the game, alt-tabbing out of the game, then restarting Comodo. Hope this helps anyone else."

Otherwise everything works perfect."
[T],dark_dark_dark,2012-08-03T20:42Z,"thanx for the upload HeroMaster. FUCK YOU .THE DARKNIGHT TEMPLARS. for your shit taste in music. I had to shut down my speackers just not to hear your install gay shit. At least have the decency and make a fucking button to stop it, not everyone likes that bitch whining."
,Zebra667,2012-08-05T10:00Z,"Oh, Christ...you're gonna bitch about the f'n song in the installer?!? Seriously?! I thought it was fine, reminded me of Tron Legacy for some ungodly reason. You don't like it, hit the fuckin' mute...oh, no mute on the installer? Well, that's what the fuckin' Windows volume icon is for, dipshit. 

Anyway, the game is awesome. I played the 'alpha', which was really a late beta. (The alpha and beta periods before release lasted a whole 2 months! So, no, it wasn't an 'alpha' by traditional standards. Alpha's, in general, are considered barely running tech demos and prototypes. Not fully functional, tech complete games) This game really caught a lot of us 4x'ers off guard and the genre really needed this shot in the arm. Really lookin' forward to a sequel, if there will be one..."

,Zebra667,2012-08-06T03:06Z,"That was the best you could do?! 'Go fuck your mother in her grave retarded zebra'? Are you 10 years old or do you live in the mountains of West Virginia...or both? You seem to have an unhealthy focus on people fucking their mothers, want to elaborate a little on that? No? You know, you could have waited another day or two until that young, undeveloped, immature brain of yours managed to come up with a comeback that didn't sound as retarded as you claimed I might be. Go back to playing on IRC and Frostwire, little man, the grown ups are too busy to sit here and try coddling you into saying your first adult sentence...

You see that skull next to your name? Yeah, it doesn't grant you royal powers or diplomatic immunity. So Viva La Fuck Off! God Bless America!"

,b1naryatr0phy,2012-08-15T16:48Z,"@dark_dark_dark

No offense bro, but ya sound like a 12 year old. And the fact that you're gonna steal software, then have the audacity to bitch about the music playing during that software's installation just goes to show how much of a worthless cunt you really are. 

Ppl like you are PRECISELY the reason why the scene has gone to complete shit. And yes you may have that cute little pink skull next to your name, but I hope you understand that it's only bcuz TPB has no fucking standards anymore. "
[T],dark_dark_dark,2012-08-15T21:53Z,"Yes bitch, that's what people do here, download things that sad fucks like you usually pay for (we still call it download not ""theft""). And i do complain about the things that are bothering me, it doesn't take that much boldness to do it, specially when it's something so simple like the absence of a bloody button, as i don't like to stop all sound for 10 minutes just because a fucktard thought it would be cool that people listen to his douche unstopable music. 
The only ""worthless"" cunts in here, b1naryatr0phy it's you and that other nerd - zebra (so far) as your upload lists show. So please, stop bitching about people ""like me"" bitching about the software we share, it's not like i'm expecting a change, i'm not even expecting the motherfucker it was adressed to see or care. You can go eat some more shit now ""bro"". No offense"

You may want to take a few anger management classes."
,Dufox,2012-09-11T13:26Z,"dude has a point about installer music tho.

atleast put a mute on it so those of us who dont wanna hear it can do other things while it installs.

its a small price to pay for a free game but alas it would be nice to have a mute button."
