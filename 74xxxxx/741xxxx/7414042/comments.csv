,frndfrvr,2012-07-06T01:19Z,HEY .BONE. I've been downloading your torrents and they are awesome. But in this game I'm getting an error of no space in memory card. It says to clear 0 mb.  So is it installing on sd card or external sd. And how to solve this problem coz I have enough memory on my sd card... (galaxy s2)
,LaNPaRtY1987,2012-07-06T13:36Z,same problem!:(
,BigSniff,2012-07-06T14:46Z,"Pointless uploading the apk with the SD data because the data can not be downloaded through the game.

I'll update with links and instructions in a minute."
,BigSniff,2012-07-06T14:53Z,"Don't think I can post links so just google ""bestapk  amazing spiderman 1.1.0 apk and you'll see the links for SD data."
,Ayush770,2012-07-07T18:03Z,if you want links for data then download my torrent- https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7414669/The_Amazing_Spiderman_1.1_HD_for_all_android_devices
