,BoonesFerry,2012-07-04T13:50Z,"Huh? Unless you are using a numbering scheme that is totally different than all the other bbuk files here on tpb, this episode has not aired yet."

,notouchx,2012-07-05T02:42Z,"BoonesFerry: this is yesterday's episode.  Last I checked, 30 comes after 29.  Why so confused?"
,BoonesFerry,2012-07-06T12:01Z,"following the series numbering of torrents that have been posted to tpb so far, at the timen this torrent was posted episode 30 had not even aired in the uk yet.Dont be a smart ass, I know what number comes after 29. If this torrent s13e30 came from TheBox (a uk private tracker) or one  then this would be, going by the other torrents on tpb, episode 31. Maybe you missed a episode and dont even know it. "
,BoonesFerry,2012-07-06T12:06Z,"Hmm, well, i think i got my numbers mixed. It's all good though. Except for the smartass notouchx :]~"
