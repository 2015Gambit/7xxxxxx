,oilslickjim,2012-07-07T23:46Z,Thanks Bone - you always do great work.  Just for those using this on Galaxy S2. It would not work for me using the sdcard/Android etc but when I placed it inside the obb folder on the phone memory it works perfectly. Thanks.

,yotomyo,2012-07-11T15:29Z,failed to download? check internet connectivity? my connectivity is fine. why is this?
,nairobi19,2012-07-13T03:35Z,"I know you give good quality uploads BONE but this one doesn't work. 

After following your instructions the game doesn't launch. It asks to download extra from the server, then fails. "
,nairobi19,2012-07-13T05:06Z,"ok i figured out what was wrong, you said the folder should be called "" obb' "" with the little .. ' .. 

also, why is the file in an archive? 

UNRAR THAT FILE FIRST, THEN PUT IT IN THE MOTHERFUCKING FOLDER

BTW the folder doesn't have the ' as BONE wrote. 
"
,nairobi19,2012-07-13T05:08Z,"i meant to say ... there is no  '  in the folder name. 

BONE says you should call it Obb' 

Don't put that apostrophe there

Call it Obb 

That's it 

And unzip that motherfucker before putting it into the folder"
,nairobi19,2012-07-13T17:15Z,OK now it has stopped working
,qb87,2012-07-14T01:16Z,"It works for me. install apk, Unzip the file and drop in in sd/android/obb  create it if it dosnt exist. not that hard. Droid Razr"
