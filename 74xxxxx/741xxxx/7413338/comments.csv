nothing wrong with that, just put it in the description plz. Plus a mention of the equipment used. It sounds like a decent MM.  

It has quite a bit of noise btw. My lp is a lot cleaner. Timbre is a bit off to. "

I took it out there"
,]eep,2012-07-07T03:41Z,"thank you
The screenshots are in the torrent too

It is demonstrably 24-96 but not from the original mastertape, a good remaster in HD as I was hoping for. 
The soundquality is depending very much on the equipment used and that is no studio quality here.

This is more lively but IMO the CD-rip is better. 

I really don't get it why ppl take so much time and effort to digitize LP's on not so very good old equipment when there are better versions allready as flac available. No offense."
,yura15cbx,2012-07-07T15:16Z,"Maybe they did it before the best version became available online, or interested in trying to digitize their own. ""DIY"". I generally spend my time just to download. And after several terabytes of music, hardly realized that someday I will spend time to digitize something myself. Rutracker have a lot more than I might be looking for, a lot of seeders and everything is carefully described."

,yura15cbx,2012-07-13T14:22Z,"I use Google Chrome. There is an automatic translation of the entire page. I tried to translate into English, all perfectly translated, including the download link. You only need to register. But I think the registration form is translated as well. But you can try to go with one of my accounts: name: yura17ccb, password: yura427. Russian tracker - I think itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s just a treasure of world culture. The difference from piratbay is hard to make the upload because it is constantly moderated complex requirements to the issuance (description, screenshots, etc.) (I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t made a single upload that was a fully correct) and there is some mechanism for monitoring the ratio of uploading and downloading, but there are no fake uploads, each upload have many reviews and comments, and very good speed, there is no uploads without seeders. And I found there all visual and musical mankind createations that were looking for. :)"
,chabosun4,2012-07-20T07:11Z,"Excellent upload. Yes, there's a bit of surface noise, but the quality is terrific. Thanks very much, yura15cbx."
,chabosun4,2012-07-20T07:14Z,"BTW, ]eep, if ""your lp is a lot cleaner"", go ahead and upload it instead of bitching about this rip. Your user page is a trifle thin in the uploads department."
