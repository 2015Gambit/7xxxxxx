,samsneed,2012-07-04T08:46Z,"Great! quick dl, 720p"
,BoonesFerry,2012-07-04T10:29Z,Thanks for the 720p
,netgrazer,2012-07-04T22:12Z,"I appreciate the upload, but can you please unRAR the thing before you torrent it?

If you don't do it for us, do it for the environment. This way it costs 100s of times the amount of power needed to make it watchable.

The compression's not helping anyone, and the CRC is not needed with BT. As for ""proof"" that it's an original scene release: who gives a flying fuck.

Another reason for unRARring: you can seed the very thing you're watching, instead of having 2 copies on your HD. This torrent doesn't need it, but as a rule this will lead to more seeders. Just saying.

Still, thanks for the release!"
,eightyth_attempt2register,2012-07-04T23:31Z,Yeah why is it RAR'd in the first place?
,J3rryKo42O,2012-07-05T08:40Z,Netgrazer makes a good point and apparently wants to write a book.
