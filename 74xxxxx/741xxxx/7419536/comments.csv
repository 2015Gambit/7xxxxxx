I'm ranting about it here because IMDB wants my phone number so they can spam fuck my phone just for me to send this asshole a private message on their forums (and I'm not that stoopid ; ) ). But I digress not all the hellraiser's were fantastic some even bordering on cheezy ,but for anyone interested in the hellraiser movies bloodline is by far the best one with hellraiser 2 being a close second. Bloodlines  ties together all of the history of the puzzle box and how it became a portal to hell! So in conclusion fuck snobby reviewers on IMDB 99.9% of them suck big black cock at the local porn theater glory hole. I recommend people just watch shit and draw their own conclusions and watch fucking hellraiser!!!!"
