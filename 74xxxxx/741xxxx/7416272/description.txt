This time Max and Stacy discuss bankers doing 'the ultra violent' on the global financial system and propose the Keiser Technique to remedy the asymmetric approach to financial justice. In the second half of the show Max talks to Reggie Middleton of BoomBustBlog about whether or not French banks are next to collapse and about the flashing fraud warnings on Libor that were always there in the credit default swaps market.
