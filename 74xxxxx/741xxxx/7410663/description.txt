I have been downloading torrents for several years, but this is only my second time in giving something back.  There is no public torrent of Best of the Match Game, so I went ahead and ordered a copy and ripped the DVDs.  Yes, the size of the shows large, but I wanted to preserve the quality of the remastered vids.
And YES, THEY DESERVE TO DIE!! AND I HOPE THEY BURN IN HELL!!
