[V],globeplus,2012-07-06T23:00Z,"To treutiger : i canÂ´t agree with you , black borders at the top and the bottom of the picture removed and colours improved , generally speaking still a little better than any other available copy for the moment and of course i agree with you with expecting a better copy but for start this one isnÂ´t that bad ... you know what i mean because in here the most common thing is to get the possible cams first then get DVDrip or BRay rip when it is possible ... in the end just the normality , of course that i understand to the wish to get new nice copys of the movies soon as possible but that it is also the normality i guess ... see you and nice movies to all of you ..."
