,Thaedius,2012-08-01T06:22Z,"Same problem I had with Project X, Cinavia pops up 10 minutes into the movie and then I may as well be deaf, cause I wont hear anything."
,fuckme88,2012-08-11T10:32Z,The problem your having Thaedius is that you are watching it on a Sony product. whether it be PS3 or Sony Blu ray. They all have that built in software for burned DVD's. Fuck Sony!!! XBOX Rules!
,phrozenstare,2012-08-25T20:38Z,@fuckme88: no its just the file is crap. i have found others of this movie that work fine.  so now that we have cleared that up you can go back to letting MS rape your ass
