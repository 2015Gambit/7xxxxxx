[V],psspss,2012-07-05T05:29Z,"yes everyone might have to wait for afg to rip it as xvid.. I only did lots of shows cos everyone went horrid mp4s only.. when 720p and xvid for each episode worked for everryone

however I often have a xvid hours or days before others .. not sure why it takes ages for afg cvids to show up sometimes and not at all for
some shows"
