""Error - Filename error.""

STUPID SHIT! No explanations either. Just confusing error message.
A perfekt way to loose customers.
Make them irritate  and also ignore them.

I got many extra hours(!!) of hard work, I found one reason. Files ending with .txt was not allowed, so I rename them to .nfo, which is a NONE-standard for text. If you use default settings and doubleclick on a file like that, you might have big problems. Why they don't want textfiles in a movie-torrent? How to describe files, instructions and so on in a good standard way now?

The Pirate Bay have to undo that shit!"
