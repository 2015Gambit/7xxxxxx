@lilsean23 - I'm afraid Armaggedon, Knowing, and the Mummy movies won't happen. The POTC films might happened somewhere down the line tho...

@dilligaf247 - sorry, I don't know anyone with either film, so they're unlikely.

@fedeval - I might do the X-films down the line, but probably not soon.

@bgyygg67 - I'm Mac-based, so I use a piece of freeware called Subler (Mac-only) to add the extra tags (like HD, cast, director, copyright, contentID, etc) that everyone loves. For Windows systems, I'm told the tagging abilities of Subler is duplicated on a program called MetaX."
