In 2001 Christian music gained a new voice when legendary innovator Kirk Franklin asked Anthony Evans to join his ministry. Evans harmonized with his mentor and friend for four extraordinary years, until the rhythm his own maturing music set in motion a solo career. Now, for a decade, Anthony has voiced the Gospel with such a melodic, thought-provoking style that he has emerged as one of Christian music's premiere male vocalists ΓÇªand worship leaders.
 
"What makes Anthony's music incredible is his voice. What makes his ministry incredible is his heart. What makes his message incredible is his walk with the Lord."  ΓÇô Franklin Graham
