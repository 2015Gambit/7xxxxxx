Presented by Gary Imlach, Chris Boardman and Ned Boulting. Commentary: Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen. Highlights of Stage 6, Epernay to Metz. A day among the vineyards for the peloton today, from Champagne to the Moselle. It should be another sprint stage, although the slightest miscalculation could allow a breakaway to make it home.
