,tflagger997,2012-07-07T19:24Z,Since the DVD is not released yet - gonna have to go with Fake (or worse - a bad cam that was bloated to 4GB).
,M89SE,2012-07-07T19:40Z,"Well it's to my suprise really good quality the negative thing is it's dubbed in russian.

Helt ok kvalitet dock dubbad p책 ryska n책gon som vet var man kan hitta undertexter till denna film?"
,TheProFTW,2012-07-07T23:22Z,"Great quality, shame it's in russian

Hope that we can get a dvdrip/dvdr in english"
,bob6yt7,2012-07-10T04:17Z,"tflagger997 A DVD rip can still exist, copies do get distributed for review purposes so they can still be ""Leaked"" to the internet even though the movie is still in theatres..."
,Lindy,2012-07-11T20:32Z,"This the Russian R5 that is being used with English cam audio 'compilations' that are being uploaded here atm.

Like it says in the description: RUSSIAN AUDIO ONLY.

Great if you're Russian. :/"

,fitnessrx,2012-07-15T22:31Z,The dvd must have had both dubbed and undubbed... obviously this guy hate everyone who isnt russian =(
,tflagger997,2012-07-28T17:56Z,"Yes bob6yt7 they do, but for this low budget movie and taking this long to leak?  I know of Chinese groups that get the ones you are talking about at least a day before the movie hits the theaters.

So, if this were DVD then it would have all audio.  So it is a cam.  There are really good HD cams.  I have seen two that looked like they were VCR quality, but they are cams just the same."
,Keka_Umans,2012-07-31T02:23Z,I hope The DVD Gets Released Soon... This Looked Good
