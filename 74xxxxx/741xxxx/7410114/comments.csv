,Neogalik,2012-07-04T18:33Z,Thank you for downloading my torrent. Please leave feedback.
,find1987,2012-07-06T15:34Z,I need seeds bad. I have been downloading three days now. Only 4 Mbs dled. Although 16 mbs has uploaded how the heck does that work!
,Neogalik,2012-07-07T00:45Z,"I am currently the only seeder. Nobody else has downloaded the full torrent yet. I just upgraded my router, so expect faster seeding."
,radamw,2012-07-10T12:14Z,Is this the funimation dub?
,Neogalik,2012-07-10T15:37Z,"No, it is the original, uncut. Why didn't you just look up the episode list on Wikipedia?"
,dd31879,2012-07-16T00:43Z,"Not Complete! Episodes 037, 104, 252 under half an episode."
,Neogalik,2012-07-18T03:32Z,"Then I will be deleting this torrent and fixing the problem, then reupload it."
,RekkaKien,2012-07-22T06:34Z,i registered just to show my appreciation. i have the dragonball z series already but i been lookin for the uncut version. so thanks for the upload & ill seed for awhile after im done
,zx6rider,2012-07-23T20:53Z,try in MP4 format instead of WMV zipped.. no one like RAR or zip files...its just lazy uploading in most people's opinion. Thanx keep it up.
,Neogalik,2012-07-31T18:26Z,"It's not zipped, even though the description says that it is. I put it in WMV just to support Microsoft products."
,divyesh94,2012-08-16T02:24Z,lookin for this for a long time. nice file size!
,tmsme,2012-08-16T04:32Z,"Thanks for the effort, but horrible quality.

Like horrible horrible.

320x240? Is this 1999? 

And WMV?!?

Thanks, but no thanks, I'll find a torrent where going full screen doesn't give me flash backs to RealVideo fan subs from the 90s."
,Neogalik,2012-08-21T21:20Z,"Considering that these episodes were made in 1990 and up, you would think that they are old. Obviously."
