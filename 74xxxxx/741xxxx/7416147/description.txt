The ANTs are in charge of arrangements for the school dance. Fletcher and Chyna go together so Fletcher doesn't have to go with Violet. Meanwhile Chyna and Olive pretend Fletcher's dead to raise money for the dance by selling his paintings, but try to hide Fletcher when the person who bought them shows up at the dance. Cameron looks for a date to the dance, and finds a girl who apparently likes him, too, but it turns out she was imaginary, as Cameron hallucinated her because he couldn't face the fact that no one would go to the dance with him.
