,ashsama,2012-07-06T07:12Z,It's cool how David Carradine still makes movies though he's been dead for 3 years...

,catfly,2012-07-06T10:59Z,From just looking at that cover poster... damn that is gonna be one shit movie. Dave Carradine in a beret? And that bloke top left is self-induced retarded.
,gekfoot,2012-07-06T15:02Z,Dude in the top left of the DVD cover has great dick sucking lips
,Pdid,2012-07-06T15:04Z,"^^That fella does look as if the botox injections have hampered his intellectual ability a tad...This movie is garbage, but thanks for the up scene4all....been busy lately :)"

,Iceburgslim,2012-07-06T20:26Z,"""It's cool how David Carradine still makes movies though he's been dead for 3 years... ""

Thats what I was thinking. I have a feeling that Steven Seagal will be the same curse."
[T],dark_dark_dark,2012-07-06T20:46Z,this is a horrible piece of shit. you might just like it if you'r a retard... other than that don't bother.
,FUTOGy,2012-07-06T22:38Z,thank for upload BUT MOVIE IS TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT DOWNLOAD! 
,coachtsr,2012-07-06T23:19Z,the trailer is bad! if the trailer is bad then the flick must be worse!
,greetz02,2012-07-07T01:51Z,"@drunk-mon you're such a hypocrite. you bad mouth others for not giving a a A/V rating, yet you do the same."
,Powerslave0,2012-07-07T07:56Z,"Of course it's crap.  David Carradine died in 2009! Three years later is this? Yeah, either been on the cutting room floor for years, or they needed to doctor it up."
,VoicesInMyHead,2012-07-07T17:34Z,"A/V:  9/9
M: 2 (IMO)

I believe this movie damaged my soul."
,Heffy001,2012-07-08T04:13Z,Final feature film of David Carradine who died in 2009. Its been on the shelf all that time.
,Zeckart,2012-07-09T06:24Z,"My eyes!! my eyes hurts! i saw a monster! sorry, that was Paul Sampson..."
,websterphreaky,2012-07-09T07:29Z,"You have NO LIFE if you download this piece of shit. Dead or not, I have lost the last tiny bit of respect I had for little grasshopper David Carradine. If he were still alive, I'd hit him with 3 rotten tomatoes and a moldy head of lettuce."
,GCpirate,2012-07-09T11:52Z,@ catfly lol self-induced retarded thats a good1
,bravefreak1995,2012-07-10T03:29Z,"A/V: 8

M: -10

Don't waste your bandwidth."
,mtbno1,2012-07-10T18:04Z,If the movies that bad sounds like a must see lol.   thanks  scene4all 
,aradiel,2012-07-11T05:25Z,"Sampson looks like he got the same plastic surgery a female porn star would get. Just wrong. Carradine makes a joke about keeping his belly flat, and he looks about six months pregnant. There's also a male actor playing a female character for some reason, not a cross dresser, just a man playing a woman."
,Zenophobe,2012-07-11T12:52Z,everytime I see Udo Kier's face I want to laugh at it and slap it at the same time...  this looks like the shit movie for the ages.  The dude on the upper left is actually that girl from Less Than Zero with too much botox and doing the reverse-crying game
,Arxithia,2012-07-12T02:04Z,I just wanna fuck these templars in the arse
,michan123,2012-07-12T18:48Z,"i watched this cus it was still unrated on IMDB

This movie is terrible!!lol The main character had way to much plastic surgery,I'd dodge this one a mile,its a waste of life watch "
,highlander888,2012-07-15T07:11Z,Thanks for the upload. But why is this movie still in the top 100? It's awful!
,DJ_SEVEN,2012-07-20T21:43Z,"This is the new MPAA and RIA way, gona bombard torrentsites with really crappy movies and keep the goodies to themselfves, and if you wanna have a looksee, well then you pay the penalty.

Why on heavens earth havent producers and directors went the same way as many game designers and produers this year to be more precise, KICKSTART, make movies that people want to see, and then you get paid! simple as that. Night of the templar, Soldiers of fortune and Assasins bullet must be some of the worst movies ever made, incl some of Udo Bolls work, hahaha"
,Rush,2012-07-26T01:42Z,Ratings: 3.0/10 from 308 users  aka trainwreck
,TofuFighter,2012-07-26T20:03Z,"An unmitigated pile of dung of the tallest order.
I'm actually sorry that the audio and video was so good because i got to see and hear it at max quality.

Quite clearly the worst acting i've ever seen from Donatella Versace, and also probably the reason Carradine killed himself.

Watch it if you want Pirhana 3dd to seem like an oscar winner."
