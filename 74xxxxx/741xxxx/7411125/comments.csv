,ThatTimmKid,2012-07-05T17:42Z,"I thought you said this was in english?
It completely slowed down my computer and stopped my internet pages from uploading, and then on top of that it was english subtitles and not english dub just like you've posted... what a let down =/"

[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-05T21:26Z,"thattimid, if you see my other torrents they are all Dual Audio. if English is not the primary language then switch it Via VLC/MPC. Right click, Audio, Track, then English."

,DialupBroski,2012-07-17T12:30Z,"Thanks for the upload. Much appreciated! 
Also, is there any chance you might be able to upload a high def version of Code Geass dual audio? I can't find any good HD versions. The one I did find is horribly overrun with leechers and already is a huge 20gb file. Just thought I'd ask. I always look for your releases, so thanks."
