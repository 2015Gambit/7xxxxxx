Languages and crapz?"
[T],thenoobish,2012-07-05T22:39Z,"I really dont think anything is taken out. The original uploader must have meant that it's the whole game, therefore he says its a full rip! Meaning all the content from the whole game is there.."

= wut?"
,Nounread,2012-07-05T23:08Z,1GB seems small.
,Farrisen,2012-07-05T23:13Z,"Well the ""scene"" release is roughly 2 gb, that's why it seems that something is ripped seeing as this one is 1GB ^^

Or it's just mega compressed in those 2 .rars o.O"
,Kaliedo,2012-07-05T23:24Z,"A bit confused, your title says its been cracked while your instructions suggest it hasn't. 

which is it?"
,Ciupearca,2012-07-05T23:26Z,"Fake. Setup is in chinese. After install, i run the executable, black screen for 3 seconds then back to desktop. Games always work for me. So it`s unlikely the problem is from my end. 
Some one else try this and comment if you can get it to work"

,SenorSkur,2012-07-05T23:50Z,Well it's 3DM their setups are always in chinese. 
,vikkinen,2012-07-05T23:52Z,and installer is japanese... lol...
,vikkinen,2012-07-05T23:53Z,or chinese... dunno about that language
,vikkinen,2012-07-05T23:56Z,yeah doesent work... waste of time...
,SenorSkur,2012-07-06T00:46Z,Ya can't get it to work either. 
,88FLAK,2012-07-06T03:26Z,"Ciupearca is a fucking idiot for calling this fake. It's legit, It's just not cracked. so the uploader is a dick for having the cracked tag in title."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-07-06T06:13Z,"thos one works

,Ciupearca,2012-07-06T13:47Z,"88FLAK you are an idiot. The name says cracked full rip. It`s not cracked and it`s not full, as it`s only half the size. So screw you sir."
