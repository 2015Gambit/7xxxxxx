Unrar your files. Nobody likes passworded bullshit."
,TheWaffleGuy,2012-07-07T02:21Z,"@SwimclubOphelia - The files are NOT passworded! Why would they be? The scene doesn't use passworded rars. sceneline has NOT rared the files himself he got them this way from the scene or from someone else who ""leaked"" the files from the scene. The scene is group of elitists who believe they are better then the common p2p:er. They rip dvds, record tv shows, crack games and upload to their own network. These files are always rared. Somewhere along the way when the files leak out from their network to the regular torrent user these files are often unrared. So you see that it isn't sceneline that rars the files, it's nearly every other uploader that unrars them before uploading."
