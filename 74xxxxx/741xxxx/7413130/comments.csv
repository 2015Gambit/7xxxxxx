I do not have the extended/long version.  If I find it randomly, I can upload it, but there is no Blu Ray extended version on any torrent sites.  There is a dvdrip of the extended here however, if you are fine with a 720x384 resolution instead of 1280X720."

,guidoanselmi,2012-09-18T03:05Z,I don't believe there is a commercially released hi-def edition of the long (three hour) cut. The BR set contains the shorter theater version in 1080p and the extended cut only on DVD. Editions of this I have seen in video rental stores are only the DVD version. Maybe they're planning to put out the BR of the longer version later and hope we'll be sucked into buying it again.
