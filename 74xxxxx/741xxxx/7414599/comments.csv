Thanks again ettv!

,clawedthecat,2012-07-05T11:04Z,can any one tell me why there has been a shift to .mp4 format?
,markgri,2012-07-05T12:39Z,"@clawedthecat this happened because mp4s are more modern formats and give a better picture quality in smaller sizes but they do not play on most devices like dvd players, PS3, ect."
,PKCMVA,2012-07-05T12:58Z,"mp4 produces a better quality picture as well as a finished smaller file size compared to AVI's of the same.  This in turn saves bandwidth when downloading movies and or TV shows.

Sadly those of us that still use older computers with out dated video cards, experience a video that plays back jerky and sometimes stops and starts because of the compression, memory and CPU etc.

That's one of the reasons people still prefer AVI (XviD).  Others just don't like change and why fix it if it ain't broke!"
,judendom,2012-07-05T15:49Z,"Thank you, still the best XviD supplier on the entire web. Much love."
,kophee,2012-07-05T19:40Z,"true to all the comments above, though mp4 is technically better in size and quality, avi lets me play directly from my tablet to the tv! thanks for the up!"
