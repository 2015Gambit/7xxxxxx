I have a flat screen tv and most of this shit looks horrible  but on laptop awesome hahahah!
,obvious2me,2012-07-10T23:24Z,"Of course it is going to look terrible on a decent sized television. When you fullscreen a video that starts out 1/10 the size of the screen, pixelation."
,obvious2me,2012-07-10T23:26Z,That is why I usually stick to 720p or better videos.
