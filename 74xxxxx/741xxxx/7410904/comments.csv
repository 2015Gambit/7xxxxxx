,shih9019,2012-07-04T15:36Z,definitely not a telesync. BAD sound and when the camera straightens up picture is watchable. thanks for the effort uploader but it is definitely a cam. A 1 / V 5

,deuxieme,2012-07-17T03:31Z,Why do people obsessively re upload this SAME arabic torrent
,dlarrym1111,2012-07-17T19:08Z,"@Gogeta4X: IT says. . . TS (TELE-SYNC) so the downloader will know that the Audio was Synced to the Video. It is NOT something that has to do with the VIDEO source it self. It is a way of making sure the audio is SYNCED UP with the VIDEO. . . .

 ""why does it say TS when it's a CAM??""

Like I said, you can TELE SYNC the Audio to video captured from a CAMcorder only if the audio is a ""micro FM  broadcast for the hearing impaired. . .OR it is when a professional grade video camera (like a National Geographic wildlife Photographer would own/use... NOTE:they cost in excess of $20,000 USD)

Do you think your store bought DVD's are synced by mere guessing and hoping that the Audio and the Video sync up???
 NO. . . . It is electronically synced by the a TIME STAMP that is added to the beginning of the video so it can be TELE-SYNCED or TIME SYNCED.

PLEASE at least pretend to be something other then a RETARD by going to Wikipedia and reading up on such things.

Here is a Cut and Paste from WIKIPEDIA on the definition of TS or Tele-syncing):

The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera's own frame rate and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronisation which can lead to additional temporal aliasing. A TS is a cam, with better-quality audio.

SO, a TS IS A CAM, so the uploader isn't giving false information, it is your own ignorance that is letting you down.

Aside from not knowing what you are talking about, your FIR certain an un-grateful ASSHOLE!!!

YOU go get a camera and do it better. Show all of us how its done. . . . . OH you are a MORON and are not capable!!! 

Thanks up-loader for doing your best!
the rest of us understand the complications involved in such an undertaking."

""I'm done responding, I don't know what people want lol for me to say this release is exceptional and the quality is amazing? "" -Gogeta4skin

I didn't see anyone say anything like that. I did see your ignorant self come on here and inform everyone that ""it's a CAM"" and not a ""TS"" when you clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about. No one is saying you're suppose to like the file, your just not suppose to act like a self righteous, uninformed, ungrateful, idiot. 

It's entertaining because you come on here apparently to teach us all a lesson about TS and CAMs, and then it turns out you're a retarded chode :) haha

So that's why you're a clown and you should not be allowed to use the internet, Gotgetafag...

+ Hollywood movies are not encyclopaedias.  Just because you saw it in the movies doesn't mean they're the real deal. Dimwittedness that you portrayed and the fondness of your own sister & cousins is equally disturbing. 

So what's up with the peeve about getting the movies first? Let other people 'have' your sister or cousins first for a change.

Yeah, nothing about this movie is American -- apart from the fact that 2 of the 3 production companies of this movie are American (they own the Alien franchise and have been producing them since Sigourney was mildly attractive in the 70s) and its largest distributor is American. 

P.S. If it weren't for American financing/backing, this movie would have been a ""straight to DVD"" claymation laugher. You europeans have your enthralling period pieces. Leave sci-fi to us fat, stupid Americans, okay? Fucking bigot.
