As spoken by TheLocalBay
Not intended for misuse.. 

In recent times a 90mb file surfaced of the TPB in a Archive form and TheLocalBay came up with a Offline Search solution, this is it. So we thought why stop there so we added an ability to search KAT archives as well (Kat you can download from the site it's at the bottom called api and the TPB can be found here

Can't access TPB because your reading this as a index listing. copy and paste hash via the site listed below or the desktop hash grabber - 938802790A385C49307F34CCA4C30F80B03DF59C 

Also in this app is a section called Hash Magnet Grabber where you can easily copy any hash code of a torrent (most sites list these) and paste the hash into a box and then click 'get torrent' and it opens up your client (utorrent or compatible) for a magnet download.. 

For more info on this go to

It has come to my attention that this does get used by people who can't access to either TPB or KAT but friends provide a hash code via email/facebook/or however to get what they need.. 

Please SEED for others to Enjoy! 
Cheers, You know who! :)
