DJ turns 13 and is very excited about her first birthday party as a teenager. She has an eye on a boy her age named Kevin, who seems very nervous around her. Kimmy thinks that the best way to get them together is to arrange a scheme spin-the-bottle game in which DJ is sure to kiss Kevin. DJ is embarrassed when Danny, Joey and Jesse, who have been eaves-dropping on the party, barge into the living room, in time to stop the kiss.
