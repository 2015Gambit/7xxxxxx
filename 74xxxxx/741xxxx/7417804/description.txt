Welcome.
I decided to update the configurations of teams such as:

Arsenal
Chelsea
Liverpool
Manchester City
Manchester United
Newcastle United
Tottenham

Barcelona
real Madrid

Inter
Juventus
Milan

Bayern Munich
Borussia Dortmund

In addition to the transfers carried out were also improved team formations, the numbers of players and minor adjustments jedenastek output.

The stock balance of 5'go July.

Man hope you like it.

In the comments you post any errors in the configurations.
You can also write the output should look like eleven and that all numbers of players agree.

First Download a file.
Second We go in My Documents -> FIFA 12th
Third It deletes the file from the folder Squads0 Fifa 12 in my documents.
4th In its place into that folder, paste the downloaded file.
5th Fife 12th Launch
6th My Fifa -> Profile of Fifa 12 -> Save / Load / Delete -> Load -> Configurations and select stores called "05 07 2012 Act by Czubas Skl".
7th My Fifa -> Profile of Fifa 12 -> Save / Load / Delete -> Save -> "As the new stores."

If that does not work and pops up a file to us that is damaged squads are:

First All segments squads delete files from "My Documents / FIFA 12".
Second Go to the folder and copy the file regenerator "fifa_ng_db.db" to "FIFA 12  Game  data  db".
If there is no folder "db" then you need to create and copy a file called "fifa_ng_db.db".
Third Then run "Fifa12 i68Regenerator 2.1.1.exe". You probably will want us to program the folder where you installed the game,
So wskazujemu folder "FIFA 12" on the disk where you installed the game. Click OK.
4th When you point to just click "GO". When charging is complete close the program.
5th Now you need to copy my squads file to "My Documents / FIFA 12".
6th Fife 12th Launch
7th My Fifa -> Profile of Fifa 12 -> Save / Load / Delete -> Load -> Configurations and select stores called "05 07 2012 Act by Czubas Skl".
8th My Fifa -> Profile of Fifa 12 -> Save / Load / Delete -> Save -> "As the new stores."

This is best done on a clean install because not all moddami / update patches will work.

Every now and then I'll insert new teams updates.

Currently 14 updates the stores I have two teams make. So he writes in the comments what team do you want me to update. I will choose two that are most frequently repeated.
