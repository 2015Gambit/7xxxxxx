,crazyoliv,2012-07-08T04:18Z,"@ YIFY.

You know how to do it
You do it real well.

Why don't you try to produce 700MB file for older movies like seven (1995), Alien, ...

You know. This could be very helpfull since your video quality is mostly the very best available.

by the way, your vidĂŠo quality is way over Axxo."

,ubisuck,2012-07-29T13:21Z,"I started to watch it, no real expectations, first action scene, I said hmmmm, who choreographed that: Jackie Chan?
But the two guns with suppressors, no longer attached when they get in the house, once again attached on the 2nd floor made me shutdown VLC. Too many errors. If you're like me and you see mistakes in a movie, don't watch this."
,permaponics,2012-08-14T00:52Z,"people saying this movie sucked, are twats  from a country who think that its ok to invade a country, stay there for years, rape there women, ruin there way of life, and then force the citizens to convert to their religion or move away. 
  anyway, great movie, gives good insight to whats really going on out there, even though the simple minded think it's fictional."
,randy80,2012-09-17T05:18Z,"Not a great movie, but nice to see a great actor like Sean Bean protray a killer of Jew-hating Arab dogs. Made me smile! :)"
