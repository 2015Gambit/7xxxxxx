Lipstick Jungle, another hit novel by Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell, is headed for the small screen. While Sex and the City followed the exploits of four single women looking for love in New York, Lipstick Jungle tracks three powerful career women who are willing to do almost anything for success in the business world: Wendy Healy (Brooke Shields), president of Parador Pictures, Victory Ford (Lindsay Price), a high profile fashion designer, and Nico Reilly (Kim Raver), editor-in-chief of a hot selling fashion magazine named Bonfire Magazine.
