If you need 2nd season comment here. Otherwise it's not worth to spend the time downloading with 10 kb/s and finally uploading with 1 mb/s and they all are leechers."
,ioulianos,2012-07-10T19:45Z,Thank you. Please do you have also the 2th season in WEB-DL?
,HDPremium,2012-07-10T20:11Z,"I have the first 3 episodes, I'm downloading it from Usenet network. It turned out they deleted everything yesterday and I can't download them anymore."
,ioulianos,2012-07-12T10:15Z,"In that case, just the first 3 episodes that you already have. Is it possible? Or are you waiting for the rest? Thanks anyway for your trouble."
,HDPremium,2012-07-13T18:08Z,I'm waiting for all the episodes so I can upload them as 1 pack. But it seems like they are deleted forever so we have no luck unless somebody who pays for usenet can check.
,ioulianos,2012-07-16T09:27Z,Ok. Thanks for the update
