Furthermore, even if it was an acceptable model then it would be pointless because cherrypicking this list of games doesn't really take the broader mediascape into account. Does someone need to play all the listed games in order to be subject to a media effect? How much do they need to play them? Is the depth of media engagement important or it simply a matter of exposure? Is it mitigated if they view/read/play with other content that has a contradictory message?
Absolute bunk."
