Not here on Pirate Bay, or, if it's, has a different weird name."
,aarque,2012-07-05T08:40Z,"Think you missed the mark on this one Bolkow. If the name does not match the file, it dies anyway because the leeches couldn't find it. Means effectively this is the only one here.

Sorry, but it's a very bad torrent.

Try it and compare with this: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7441125/[FSX]_-_Rollus_-_Mirage_2000-5

P. S. Remove your sh*t..."
,alcluizPT,2012-07-18T03:27Z,"xxtsh 

Well, this torrent is 100% clean of any viruses or malware, and it's super easy to install, as described. 

Try to post something people wants, and not stealing another person's work.

Say goodbye to your re-post."
