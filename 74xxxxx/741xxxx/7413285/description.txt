Mirage 2000 -5 by Rollus, for FSX
Just unpack to FSX "C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft GamesMicrosoft Flight Simulator XSimObjectsAirplanes"

then copy the content from effects, gauge and sound folders to each folder on FSX's root.

To start the airplane, search for videos on youtube.
There's also a full manual inside.

If you like it, seed it.
