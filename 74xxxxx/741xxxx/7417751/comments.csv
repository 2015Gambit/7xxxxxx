Open the .dll with Resource Hacker and see the change."

I did as you suggested, but am not sure what to look for? I was just curious as to whether this was an updated version because of the problems that developed with the earlier: i.e. Some users reported that you could not select a drive from the drop down list in DVDFab.

In any case, thx for this upload!"
