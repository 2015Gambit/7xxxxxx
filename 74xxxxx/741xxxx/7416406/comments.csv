Have Lucky pre-installed and run it soon as you have TSF Shell up and running that way you wont get problems. (Google marked check borked my install)

Link to the luckypatcher I used : https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7403648/Lucky_Patcher_v1.9.7_(rooted_only)_Android

Once installed it can update itself to the latest version.

This shell is awsome I been playing around with it for a few hours and everything is super smooth and working great! 

Thanks OP"
