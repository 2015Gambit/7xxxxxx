,Noctulius,2012-07-06T01:53Z,"About 95% of all pirated games will not work with multiplayer, you will have to wait and see if a multiplayer crack is released, but don't hold your breath."
,qiucheng,2012-07-06T02:00Z,vikkinen: oh you cant play multiplayer in a pirated game? I wonder why....
,Lockjaw664,2012-07-06T06:48Z,"I'm getting a warning with Norton AV that this file is a trojan virus called ""ZeroAccess.B."" Is it a false positive or is the file corrupted? My AV is up to date and as soon as the setup file was used, I had a warning come up telling me that a virus was in my system."
,yayitworks,2012-07-06T08:20Z,"Just made this account to write a comment. Saw this game on steam, watched a video on youtube and thought it was absolutely amazing looking. Didn't have the money, checked pirate bay yesterday and NOPE, no torrent.

Checked today and there was one. Downloaded- it works. Version 1.03. Not sure if there are any viruses or not, don't take my word for it. Not like I care anyway, I have no important info on my PC"
,bredrinben,2012-07-06T08:20Z,"Does anybody know how to solve the problem with everything looking like %canceltitle, %accepttitle, etc.?

I also can't start a new game, it just brings me back to the main menu."
,ne0lit,2012-07-06T10:09Z,I've got the exact same problem bredrinben...Does anyone have a solution for it?Or we will have to wait for a better release?
,Brooce,2012-07-06T10:30Z,"Just a note that my virus scanner gave me a false positive during installation, specifically for a file called skinh_el.dll, part of the GUI toolkit used for the installer.

As stated, it's not a trojan/virus, but a false positive."

,kovach0,2012-07-07T03:02Z,"bredrinben and ne0lit, to avoid the problem where all text is just placeholder with %%, you have to launch the game with ""Run as Administrator""."
,ne0lit,2012-07-07T08:44Z,for the guys with problem with the % and Title things and when you cant start a game just simply move the game folder in other folder like if  it was D:GamesEndless space move it to D:Endless Space it worked for me!
