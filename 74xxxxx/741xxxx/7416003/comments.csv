,djscoki,2012-07-08T11:25Z,"well i found kinda of a fix

Several people on the zloy site are reporting about a working method to run CS:GO warez beta.
1 Download original Team Fortress 2 (SteamID 440) from Steam
2 Before client.dll is generated swap TF2 files for CS:GO files to generate a valid and individual client.dll."
