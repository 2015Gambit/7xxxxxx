,sm0k3s,2012-07-04T21:10Z,"Issue 510 is a good point to hop on the current arc, just after fear itself. This whole series has been pretty great. Thanks for the upload btw"
,Ichiroyoung,2012-07-04T21:18Z,same here i don't know where t start and really like the idea of iron man 
,Ichiroyoung,2012-07-04T21:18Z,@sm0k3 then thats where i'll start
,Rizzle033,2012-07-04T22:45Z,Yep 510 is a good place to jump on. I didn't care too much for the Fear Itself issues. But these past couple arcs have been pretty good. :)
,bravato,2012-07-04T23:42Z,"Could you upload issues #21-24, and issue 27? I can't find them anywhere, and I'd really like to read this run in its entirety.

Thanks!"

,Rizzle033,2012-07-05T09:25Z,"Batman Earth One doesn't release until the 10th of July, as far as I know.

So check back next week Slaggster."
