,yodiablo,2012-07-04T07:05Z,"gekfoot is right its in my mainframe now with a 64 bit encryption. Where do i get the extra ram for it?

@sixzeronine you're pretty aggresive for a workaholics viewer. "

you really wanna screw with The Pirate Bay ?
I'm sure they could lookup your ip and have some real fun with you ;)

I bet its someone involved with the production of the show or an anti piracy agency of some kind.. like thewebsheriff.com
