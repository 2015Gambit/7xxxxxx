Juliet hates JattΓÇÖs desi, unsophisticated    
ways and Jatt canΓÇÖt stand JulietΓÇÖs ΓÇÿnakhrasΓÇÖ.
The two fight and argue and go their         
separate ways. But life has other plans and  
brings them back again and again. Their      
constant fights and arguments soon develop   
into a friendship where they try to help     
each other as they realise that ΓÇÿbegaane mulk
che Punjabi hi Punjabi de kamm aunda haiΓÇÖ!   
However, what they hide from each other is   
the fact they are helping each other purely  
for selfish reasons and they donΓÇÖt really    
care about each other.
