,dubblue4,2012-07-04T08:45Z,thanks
,baybeh,2012-07-04T09:10Z,"Thanks for this, Auge, you're a gem!"
,russell1nash,2012-07-04T13:46Z,"Not a huge fan of the compressed dvds, tbh, yet this is such a great movie! 
In fact, i liked it much more then Secrets&Lies and Topsy-Turvy and, since I kinda hate it when Leigh gets all social in my face (fortunately, he's no Ken Loach! lol), i would say that, next to Happy-Go-Lucky and Vera Drake, this is THE Leigh movie i can re-watch periodically. And yes, Thewlis is amazing in this one, even better then in Holland's ""Total Eclipse""! Alas, I'm guessing that for a lot of people, who did not watch gems like ""Naked"", he will be ""that guy from Harry Potter""...  

Thanx for another great upload! Keep up the good work!"

As I may have mentioned a few times, most of my collection was stored onto DVD5s so that is what I mostly have to offer, my new stuff will mostly be DVD9.
DVD5 was my best option to store all these films, when I started DVD9 media was $3 each and 60% of the burns failed due to switching to the second layer. DVD5s were 25 cents each and almost never failed.
So now that I have a 16 terabyte Drobo . . .  DVD9 is not a problem, but I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t feel an overriding urge to go back and find, rent and rip 2800 disks just to make them DVD9.

On this torrent only the first disc is DVD5, the second is DVD9 . . . I know that is not very helpful as the actual film is on the first disc.

I would also like to add that I play my DVD5 rips on a 55 inch television all the time to great effect and sometimes I have played them on a projector and never noticed the smaller size.

I spent years coming up with my workflow, and I really think it works wonderfully. Have you or anybody noticed a difference in the quality of my DVD5s verses a commercial DVD9? I really am curious."

Holy crap, this is sort of embarrassing.
I never realized that Vera Drake was a Mike Leigh film; I just never noticed . . . thanks for pointing that out."

@ Auge .... Sometimes it's interesting to just 
stay quiet and read comments here at TPB .... 

I really appreciate your attitude, and you seems to keep
an open mind about what you're doing here at TPB !

==================

DVD5 verses DVD9 .... !

Yes !  I prefer a DVD9 without compression, because that's 
the ultimate Video-Quality when it comes to DVD's.

But .... At the end of the day .... Can i really notice THE VIDEO-QUALITY DIFFERENCE 
between Compressed or Not Compressed DVD's .... ?

Most of the time probably NO .... ( It's almost painful to admit it ) ....

And when i sometimes compare my own screen-shots between ""DVD5 vs DVD9"", i have 
to say that this is the reason why i keep on downloading compressed DVD5's ....

For example, I have downloaded at least 30 DVD5's from uploader ""keeybee"", and he's very good !
I have exactly the same experience when downloading from you, Auge, but i absolutely appreciate 
your new ""16 TB BOMBOM BOX"" ( LOL ) ....and what may comes out of that .... ( Sometimes size matters ) ....

=======================================================
Finally .... The greatest DVD9 uploader we have had here on the Pirate Bay, is here on this 
comment-section today, and what he has done here at TPB is nothing but unbelievable .... !

He really deserves to be on vacation, and If he reads this, I hope 
he has a great time down there in ""Quinn-Land"" .... !
======================================================="
,Scratzz,2012-07-04T23:50Z,"@Agentbay: Thank you... I'm coming back in august. From now on I'll be permanent i Sweden. They cut off of my left leg a month ago, so ""Quinn-land"" is not an option anymore!"

Hey, relax! :) I was not dissing! 
I love your work, as i have said repeatedly, and would not want to antagonize u in any way! 
I appreciate the repeated explanation on 5s vs 9s and i know what u mean, esp when it comes to costs in the past years. I usually did split the 9s into 2  5's myself. 
ANd yes, sometimes i do feel the difference between the 5s and the 9s. Not always, but one-click encodes do give worse image on my 42 plasma, not so much on my 32 led. ""Scene"" encodes are not much better either. In the end, i just like to strip myself the dvd of what i do not want! :)))
In any case, u rock! 
Thanx again for your work and keep it up!

I know you werenâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t bitching, but I really wanted to know how my rips work on other systems. 
I keep repeating my explanation because I like bragging about my 16 terabyte Drobo . . . LOL!!!"
