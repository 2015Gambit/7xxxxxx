FUBAR ShutDown 2012
-------------------

A new version of this annoying program!

This one will install as usual:
Installation takes a few seconds, and nothing else happens.

From this point, no user will be able to use Windows after login.
This program will create a "moving flood" of windows, windows and more windows.....
Windows will literally be unusable, because the view is getting blocked.
And after some time, Windows will run out of resources and stall.

If the user clicks any of these windows, or presses a key on the keyboard, Windows will immediately log off and shut down the computer.


As usual, here is the way to remove it:
1. Boot up in Safe-Mode.
2. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
3. Browse to this key:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run
4. Delete the value named "FUBAR ShutDown 2012".
