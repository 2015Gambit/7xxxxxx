Plot: A story of bravery and loyalty set in the harsh and wild environment of South East Africa. Our hero, Jock (Bryan Adams), accompanies his master Fitz (Donald Sutherland and Theo Landey) on his search for gold. Our canine hero grows from being the runt of the litter to the most famous dog in Africa. Much like the “wild west” it was a lawless time, as people from the world over came to seek their fortunes. Human’s values are something Jock stuggles to understand, what is it with Gold!
