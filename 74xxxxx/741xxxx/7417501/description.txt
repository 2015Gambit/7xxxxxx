Mathematical Theory of Reliability[Team Nanban]tmrg

Published: 1987-01 | ISBN: 0898713692 | PDF | 274 pages | 23.21 MB

DESCRIPTION:

This monograph presents a survey of mathematical models useful in solving reliability problems. It includes a detailed discussion of life distributions corresponding to wearout and their use in determining maintenance policies, and covers important topics such as the theory of increasing (decreasing) failure rate distributions, optimum maintenance policies, and the theory of coherent systems. The emphasis throughout the book is on making minimal assumptions - and only those based on plausible physical considerations - so that the resulting mathematical deductions may be safely made about a large variety of commonly occurring reliability situations.
