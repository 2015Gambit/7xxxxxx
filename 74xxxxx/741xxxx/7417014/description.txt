MACHETE: SLIM, QUICK AND EASY VIDEO EDITOR


Machete is a convenient utility for playing and editing multimedia files. Currently, Machete can edit video and audio files in AVI, FLV, WMV, MP4, MOV, WMA, MP3 and WAV formats. The support of editing functions for other formats is planned for future versions of the program.



With its extremely user-friendly design, Machete is an ideal solution for quick and easy "slicing" of your multimedia files. You can delete unnecessary fragments (e.g. cut out commercials), copy, move, mix and save individual pieces. This means that Machete combines the functionality of both video splitter (cutter, trimmer), video joiner (for joining multimedia files with exactly the same formats) and more.

None of the editing operations in Machete requires re-encoding of video or audio streams. This is why the editing process is very quick and does not lead to any loss of video quality. This puts Machete in the category of lossless video editors. Also, it means that you do not need a powerful and expensive computer to edit your video material. After a file is edited and saved, it retains its original format.

Machete fully supports Windows Clipboard functionality. It means that you do not need to save the file after each editing operation. You can do all the editing that you need in the main window, view the result and save the resulting file just once.

The program does not require installation of any special codecs in addition to regular decoders that are needed for video viewing and audio playback.
