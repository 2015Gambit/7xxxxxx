It does neither with my Samsung HDTV's 5.1 system in addition to my PC's JVC receiver/5.1 system, which is completely different with the exception that they both use SPDIF passthrough.

Be sure you do not have any audio enhancers enabled so they commonly will increase volume at certain times and are notorious for mucking up audio levels."
