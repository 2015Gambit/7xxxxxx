Question:
What are you trying to do with winrar and Demon tools?
Mount image? Extract image?
One thing I can tell you exactly, this image contains several partitions, so extract this image in winrar do not possible.
Mount this image in Windows using Demon Tools also does not make sense, since the image contains APM (Apple Partition Map). Windows does not support APM without additional drivers. I did not even mention of HFS file system that is not supported in Windows too.
I will give you advice: stop doing thoughtless and illogical things. Read Forums Before You Write. Search Google! This image do not intended to mount, but only to burn to DVD.
If you have problems with recording image try to use ImgBurn. If you have problems with booting or installing, download the image again or inspect it for bad blocks using uTorrent."
