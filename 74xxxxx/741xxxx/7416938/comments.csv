,raven786,2012-07-06T07:20Z,"When you install finish it'll show you've only 3 days to activated windows 7.

After the installation process completed then you'll run the crack (available from http://www.bitkel.com/win7_crack_4_update_4ever/). Then it'll automatically activated and restarted and showing you that windows is activated. Then you can update the anything from windows update."

I am appreciating to download my advised crack just for one time, I hope you'll never giving suggestion like that.

Because of I already had tried your long time ago and it is not update till today. Only one update will stuck which was last year released.

Why I'm giving suggestion you to use my crack's? Because I run this crack and it's updated till TODAY.

Enjoy!

,anarchist9027,2012-07-06T16:15Z,"@raven786, The difference between your crack and the piece of software is that Windows Loader is not a crack AT ALL. 

If you don't know, It emulates the SLIC 2.1 licence table on your computer and activates your version of Windows via OEM. I am guaranteeing to you that all updates WILL work Today and Months to Years to come. 

This dose not edit any files or anything like that. You should look into this before recommending people use ""Your Crack"". In my honest opinion, when it comes to software like this that uses cracks, especially in the Windows operating system, you can not be to careful and Daz's Windows Loader has been around for a couple years so there is no trust issues there. 

I would advise people to download Daz's Windows loader over your crack any day of the week because it is not trusted and you do no know if it installs a bug on your system that phones home to some remote server overseas some where that store your most valuable information.

If you are to upload something like this next time, I would STRONGLY recommend you integrate Daz'z Windows loader into the disc setup using the ""$$"" OEM method."
