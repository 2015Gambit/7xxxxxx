The glorious language of Kazakhstan deserves its own learning pack, and if you find that Turkish isn't your cup of coffee, you might wanna try Kazakh, which has a good selection of learning materials, mainly in Russian, but also in English and French.
The 2nd file in this torrent 01 Kazakh - Introduction has all the info you need to make a decision on what would be best for your Kazakh language studies.
I'll seed this torrent along with the Tibetan one, so it might be a bit slow.

P.S.
Deze pack wordt u aangeboden door het DutchReleaseTeam.
Voor de reviews van de nieuwste films, muziek, series , games etc.
