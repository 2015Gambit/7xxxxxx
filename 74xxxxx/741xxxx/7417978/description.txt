LYRICS

We took it all apart but Iâ™m wishin Iâ™d stay
in the back from something I heard you say
we didnâ™t wanna call it too early
now it seems a world away but i miss that day
are we ever gonna feel the same

Chorus:
Standin in the light till itâ™s over
out of our minds
someone has to draw a line
weâ™ll be comin a back for you one day
weâ™ll be comin back for you one day
I donâ™t even care if I know ya out of our mind
sad to leavin all behind
weâ™ll be coming back back back
weâ™ll be coming back for you one day

You can see it from the far
we will ridin that wave
blinded by the lights than thereâ™s something I crave
we didnâ™t wanna call it too early
now it seems a world away but I miss the day
are we ever gonna feel the same

[Chorus:]

Gonna rise, gonna fall gettin pulled apart..
and we all do it all â™cause itâ™s stole our hearts
gonna light up the sky or ignore the stars
and we all do it all â™cause itâ™s stole our hearts

[Chorus:]
