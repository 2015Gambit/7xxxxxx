Tonex is the most controversial singer in contemporary gospel music and perhaps more than any since Ray Charles and Sam Cooke first alchemized gospel into soul. His indiscreet lyrics, unorthodox musical approach, and unvarnished honesty stoke disquieting flames in the hearts of even the most liberal Christians. Other gospel artists such as Walter Hawkins and Kirk Franklin may have initially caused similar rumblings, but their critics quieted with changing times and they eventually became embraced by the status quo. That is unlikely to happen to Tonex; he has proven too out of the box in both religious message and presentation for most traditionalists (and even some progressives). This is a shame; since Tonex is also arguably the most multi-talented composer, arranger, producer and male singer gospel music has birthed in the last quarter century.
