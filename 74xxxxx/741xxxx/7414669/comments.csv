,2DIE,2012-07-25T00:30Z,"this torrent is gay as fuck, whats the point of uploading the apk then link to another site to download the files and also has the apk there anyway?

if the files dont download them self after installing the apk and running the game then they should be included with the download, thats the whole point of this website

i wouldnt have come to thepiratebay if i wanted to download shit in my browser instead"
