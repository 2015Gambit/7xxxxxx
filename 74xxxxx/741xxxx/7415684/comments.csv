Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 0 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,theaetetus,2012-07-13T05:48Z,"You have to be a complete and utter idiot to make an XviD rip of a BluRay DVD. Please stop doing this. It just confuses people, and makes them download and seed sucky rips like this one, when if these idiotic XviD BluRay rips didn't exist, people would be seeding competently done x264 rips instead.

At the very least, PLEASE don't include ""BRRip"" or anything else referring to BluRay in the torrent name if you do rips of BluRay DVDs using the XviD codec.

But the best thing for you to do is to delete this torrent, so people don't get fooled into thinking it is of decent quality, like I did."
