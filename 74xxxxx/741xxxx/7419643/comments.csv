,japhater,2012-07-07T02:42Z,"this is ""crossing the line"", witch is correct for its title. But a bit lame that its a week  old were i no 6?"
,lem6,2012-07-07T04:58Z,"If this is last weeks episode, in fact its not titled killers, but crossing the line even though its numbered correctly. Thanks for the person who actually got this up timely last week!"
