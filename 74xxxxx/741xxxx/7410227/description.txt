Description:
It's been five long years since Katherine lost her fiance Major Paul Banks to a menacing Indian tribe led by an evil man with one eye.
Katherine, played by the smoldering Leena, in her final and most intensely adult role is adopted by yet another Indian tribe, a peaceful group called the Nah Cha Tku. Once again, the man with the one eye lays claim to her town, plundering everything in his path, and stealing her dignity a second time. But this time there's a difference.
Katherine is dubbed "Shame," and the name will not be removed until her wicked nemisis is destroyed. Adult's most provocative director, Philip Christian turns his fascinating cameras West, in Vivid Visual's second feature presentation, Shame.
In an epic story whose message is far-reaching as the landscape it's shot in. And whose stars are as beautiful as the exotic sexual rituals they partake in.
Shame. Where white meets red. Good meets evil. Where two world's collide. And where your world is changed forever.
