,NUTTFACTOR,2012-07-09T16:18Z,"@boobsman. First off...Thanks...love your work. I get the ""Disk needs to be cleaned"" error. I have a HP external burner. I was wondering should I grab a ihas to rid myself of this error or is there something I'm missing?"
,rovert22044,2012-07-09T20:18Z,"I followed the instructions you gave to burn this .iso to a DVD, and it's still not working. The problem I seem to have is when it comes to the Truncate method. When I choose the .dvd file, and I go to burn the disc, I am told the .iso is too big and I have to choose that (according to your directions), and my 360 won't load the disc.

Help? :/"
