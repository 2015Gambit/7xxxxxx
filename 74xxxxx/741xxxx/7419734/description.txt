Ncaa Football 13 USA XBOX360-SPARE

EA Sports' long-running college football series returns to campus with a new mode 
and enough updates and adjustments to fill a college textbook in NCAA Football 13 
for Xbox 360. The most significant change for this season is an emphasis on more 
realistic passing and pass defense, with "Total Control Passing" allowing quarter
backs to take specific dropbacks, pump fake, and change the trajectory of each 
pass, and the new "Read & React Defense" producing more realistic reactions from 
linebackers and defensive backs by requiring them to see the ball before they 
make a play on it.

Adding to the franchise's stable of career modes is the new "Heisman Challenge," 
in which gamers can play as a selection of former Heisman Trophy winners and 
attempt to duplicate their award-winning stats. The popular "Dynasty" and "Road 
to Glory" modes return, once again allowing users to guide a single player or an 
entire team through multiple college football seasons. And game presentation has 
been overhauled in NCAA Football 13, with new trophies and pre-game traditions, 
updated commentary from Kirk Herbstreit, Brad Nessler, and Erin Andrews, and 
dynamic studio updates from ESPN analyst Rece Davis.
