[V],psspss,2012-07-13T05:37Z,"LOL yes its video you just have to use winrar 3
to unpack the video inside archive is all

search on google and install winrar

right click on any of the files normally .rar
and say extract here in the pop out of windows
context menu

one benefit you can partial unzip the first rar
called blahname.rar  and preview partial video
in VLC player (videolan.org) saves you wasting bandwidth download a fake file
but you have to set the option to no delete partial or damage extractions in winrars options! "
