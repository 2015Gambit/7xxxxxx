,shabbamanuk,2012-08-09T04:50Z,who the fuck gives this movie 10/10?.its total rubbish
,soletar,2012-08-17T06:02Z,"My favorite film so far for 2012 ( i haven't watched any summer movie)....

i rushed to watch it because i wanted to delete it from hard drive because after scanning through it looked like a ""dirty"" and ""grimy"" movie.


Was pleasantly surprised. Mel Gibson is so talented. *spoiler alert* he did a perfect Clint Eastwood imitation, really was hilarious "
,tee_bee,2012-08-19T23:23Z,"Same comment as everyone else -

V -10 
A - English 10   
A - Spanish - non-existent subtitles/ won't open in VLC player.  

BE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD SUBS FOR THIS BEFORE WATCHING if you don't speak spanish, or you will miss about 1/4 of the movie - the stuff that REALLY drives the plot."
