All of 'Yify's crap is like that.. everyone thinks its so great.. but its only good if you're watching them on a tablet or laptop.
You notice he never puts the Bit Rate in the movie info. It doesn't matter if it's 1280 x 720. That's just the resolution.. it's the Bit Rate that determines quality. And Yify always sacrifices bit rate so he can make these small sizes. And of course he doesn't show the bit rate in the info like i said. Would be embarrassing for him if he did. "
