Episode 13 : The Commando Raids on Norway

In the dark days of summer 1940, as Nazi armies overran much of Western Europe, Winston Churchill ordered the formation of a special raiding force known as the Commandos to carry the war back to the enemy. Its successful attacks on German occupation forces in Norway played a key role in convincing Hitler that he must keep quarter of a million troops pinned down there for the rest of the war.
