Good Stuff is the sixth studio album by New Wave band The B-52s, released in 1992. This is the first (and only) B-52s album in which vocalist Cindy Wilson does not appear, though she rejoined some years later.
A moderate radio hit was achieved with the title track "Good Stuff", which was nominated for a Grammy in 1993 as best alternative performance.
