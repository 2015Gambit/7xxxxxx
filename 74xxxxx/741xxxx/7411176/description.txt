The game is 3D with a helicopter POV

For the combat system, each weapon has a set of possible moves, with more powerful moves becoming available as points are put into the "combat" skill.

The game includes a novel magic system. Rather than having reflexively opposing categories of magic, Soulbringer's magic system is circular: Air suppresses earth, which suppresses spirit which suppresses water, which suppresses fire, which suppresses air. Considerable strategy is thus needed to achieve a desired balance within the elements.

Spells are obtained from spell books that are unlocked by runes; more powerful spells become accessible as points are put into the "magic" skill. A spell's power depends on your magic skill and on your strength within the elements that make up the spell.

Each move and spell requires a certain amount of time to prepare and execute (including drawing the weapon, if necessary) Video capture was used to display such actions for added realism. Soulbringer also takes terrain and placement into account (eg. spiders on the ground can only be hit by "low" attacks while an enemy soldier higher up on a hill can only be hit by "high" attacks)

Combinations of attacks and spells can be preset and assigned to a hot key.
