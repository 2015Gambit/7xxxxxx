ITV Tour De France 2012 Stage 4 Highlights PDTV x264 AAC

Presented by Gary Imlach, Chris Boardman and Ned Boulting. Commentary: Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen. Highlights of Stage 4, Abbeville to Rouen. Riding in crosswinds is an art, and today's stage provides the specialists with an opportunity. The race route hugs the coastline for no less than 100 kilometres, so expect the peloton to split and the best organised teams to take advantage.
