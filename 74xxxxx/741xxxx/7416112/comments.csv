Not too bad has lots of actors that are up and coming and a few from different reality shows, not a bad flick. I suggest you get real high and suck back a beer or two and then watch it."

,twi666788,2012-07-06T03:31Z,"this moving should be called ""The Three Stoogies & One Idiot""

Me, for watching it!

...and it's anti-Catholici "
,azzwipe74,2012-07-06T04:19Z,anti-catholic?...thats one good thing anout it...still not watching this shit
,snowbirds,2012-07-06T05:53Z,"No, actually it's anti-Catholici.

Just to be clear."
,killCaseyAnthony,2012-07-06T08:13Z,"so its anti-catholic? dude, you need to swallow a huge bottle of prescription sleeping pills. Its amazing how ""christians"" are always bitching about such silly stuff, but they are usually the first ones to be anti-jew, or anti-muslim, or anti ANYTHING that they dont agree with. STFU. How would your catholic church feel about you downloading pirated content online? go play in traffic"
,Daevotion,2012-07-06T10:39Z,"s0rds, Jim Carrey is still in the movie.. did you not watch it.. hes the dude with the bowl hair cut."

,gifgaz,2012-07-06T13:05Z,"i had never seen anything from the three stooges before this movie. but i was stoned when i saw it, and laughed my ass off! (Norway)"

,stratofan1105,2012-07-06T23:39Z,you people complain too much. stop being little bitches. they kept the humor to the same exact style the Stooges made with a modern twist. its what they would have been like if they were around today

,zakimar,2012-07-07T15:27Z,"I haven't seen this movie yet, but it can only be the stupidest movie of the year if Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, or Sacha Cohen haven't released a movie that year also."

,HalukAka,2012-07-08T13:22Z,"Audio / Video quality is maximum for a 700 Mb file. Movie is not bad (for a kids' movie). A few really funny jokes to keep adults entertained (Doughnot Remover and the Kardashians joke were hilarious). If you're an adult, get stoned before watching this -otherwise it might be disappointing"
,adinko,2012-07-08T19:18Z,Waste of time. worst piece of crap movie ever...

for those of you who say the movie isnt any good, then i doubt you watched the old versions of the 3 stooges. I found it pretty funny the entire movie."
,splinter48708,2012-07-17T19:36Z,"Folks...This is based on slapstick comedy.  The Three Stooges started in the 1920s in Vaudeville acts and, well, at the time the blows had to be real (so Moe slapping Larry would be heard in the back of the theater).  This movie recreates that slapstick comedy with a modern twist.  The slaps, eyepokes, hammers to skull and even the lobster down Larry's pants with IMPLIED nutcracker are sound effects and ""selling"" the shot.  Moe slaps Larry. sound guy hits a button on the console, Larry sells the move and makes sound of pain.  Easy.  or Moe eyepokes Snooki and he hits in the upper part of the orbital bone, Snooki sells the move by yelling OW and putting her hand to her face.

It's a more physical comedy, people, and if you're too bent on being PC...don't bother watching this...go back to Bill and Ted."

As an avid fan of the Three Stooges, I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. Anyone who says it sucks, is to young to know what the Three Stooges is. The little clip at the ending proves that we're raising a generation of complete stooges."
