Patch courtesy of The Blade and a pre-cracked game application courtesy of TOBW. 

The patcher requires internet and that you use the game's auto-update to update it to version 1.1.1.

The pre-cracked 1.1.1 game application is a application replacement. No updating or internet is required.



Play through a fun Star Wars galaxy that combines the endless customization of LEGO with the epic story from all six episodes of Star Wars. This is the definitive LEGO Star Wars comprising the first two games and expanding them with new characters, enhanced visuals, and more bonus levels than you can shake a lightsaber at.

LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga is a family-friendly game, which is both funny and challenging. Pick and choose your characters wisely to engage in combat, solve puzzles and work together as a team to defeat the dark side.
