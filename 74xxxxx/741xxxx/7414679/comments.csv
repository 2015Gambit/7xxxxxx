Seems some kind person did us fans a favor ;)

Thanks a lot for getting this episode out for us all. This is a popular show :)

WEB-DL ? I'm assuming somebody had to go buy this episode online ?
Just a guess.. maybe a subscription at a service or something too ?? 

Big thanks to the uploaders (seeders etc)
And the people that go to thehtrouble to get the video for us, especialy if your paying out of pocket for the source lol"
