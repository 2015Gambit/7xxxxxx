Notes -

Readnfo because the video is very noisy removed much of the noise as possible without loosing so much detail from the video 

and ran a few color noise filters and finall messed with hue and sharpness settings turned out nice...
dark on the night scenes... not many though most of the movie is in the day time... overall a watchabale copy until hd 

source comes out...

the audio is very good sounds almost like line.. messed with the bass and eq band settings make it sound good :)

enjoy
