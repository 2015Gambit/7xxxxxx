,Lebada3,2012-07-06T08:32Z,Any chance of a non 3d version of this? In 1080p preferably. 
,sc0ob817,2012-07-06T18:13Z,why does the duration say 1hr and 28mn if its history of the world in 2 hours? the title clearly suggests it should be a 2hr movie
,J-RedtheRed,2012-07-06T19:21Z,"dammit. I got excited at first. lol when i read this I thought Mel Brooks had finally made a sequel to History of the World part 1. Oh well, stil may be interesting. 

oh and the reason its 1 hr and 28 min is because it aired on TV with commercials."

,toryglen-boy,2012-07-15T09:02Z,"Very interesting, and great 3D, but very glitchy, making it just about unwatchable, subjects feeze then jump to another thing all together, sentences get cut off half way through explanations. spoils what would have been a great show. thanks anyway :)"
