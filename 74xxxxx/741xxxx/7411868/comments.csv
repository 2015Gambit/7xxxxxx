,ForbiddenSoul,2012-07-06T08:55Z,"Thanks!

I used WinRAR, and made it a SFX file (Self Extracting Archive). Really handy feature to WinRAR. Well see about an x64 version but no promises = )

I should also mention you need Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package to run this program. I didn't include it in the archive"

,stalker277,2012-07-24T02:21Z,"@jasonfly, don't be upset, these kids are like flies on s#!7 until a proper keygen comes out."
,stalker277,2012-07-25T23:15Z,"Get Master Collection CS6 from Adobe, pick only DW to install and use the X-force keygen.

I've just tested it and it's working... no 50% CPU usage on idle. Plus Photoshop is Extended."
