Lots of versions of this former number one in over a dozen EU countries and of course winner of the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest but this copy is LOGO FREE and direct from the Swedish National TV service from the final selection contest, where of course Loreen won the right to represent her country and chalk up a 5th Win for Sweden in Eurovision.

I have taken great care to sort out the screen ratio so it is a true 16:9 picture and keep the quality of sound and vision as high as possible.

So enjoy dear Pirate Bay User and rejoice in a free and open internet despite all that is trying to censor and restrict our freedoms of expression in promoting the artist and there music to the world for free.
