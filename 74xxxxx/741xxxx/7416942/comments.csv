,rasmusthe,2012-07-06T06:04Z,"I have Minecraft 1.2.4 and installed this snapshot but some things are weird, animals sometimes go through fences (when the farm is crowded) and some trees are taller than they were (and I didnt find any reference to that in the snapshots history in the minecraftwiki).
Are those errors from this snapshot or is it because I installed it on an older version?"
[T],jmz619,2012-07-06T08:21Z,In my opinion it could be because of both.
