I made this because I couldn't find an H264 1080p 5.1 channel version anywhere (only 1080p 2.0 or 720p 5.1) so I got the MPEG2 stream version and re-encoded it.  My file size is smaller than the HQ 720p versions I've seen because I used deblocking, decombing, an 8x8 transform, and other H264 options, so this might not play on your phone (I use a quad core i7 for playback!).
