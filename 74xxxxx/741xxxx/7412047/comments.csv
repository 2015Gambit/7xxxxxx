,Tourniquest,2012-07-04T20:19Z,These are quite wonderful. Has anyone seen Swedish subs synced for this version? I wouldn't want the kids to grow up watching the bad stuff.
,D932,2012-07-05T07:32Z,Thank you! Freaking George Lucas screwing with perfection...
,]eep,2012-07-05T22:50Z,"why????

This reminds me of a story... Herman Brood , rocker/painter/artist went to a museum with a camaracrew to watch his own paintings. He took a spraycan secretly. Suddenly he started spraying paint on HIS OWN paintings on display. The curator totally lost it there and almost got a heartattack. 
The painter/vandal simply stated ""hey, it's my creation and I think it's not finished yet"". And he was right! 

Just so with GL: in 1977 he was on a budget and was never happy with the result because he couldn't show the story like he had it in his head because of the lack of technology back then.

Wrong.  Artists sometimes don't know when to stop and they go beyond the point of masterpiece to wrecking their creation.  Herman Brood's work of art in your example may have been the entire act of creation to destruction.  Lucas is now tinkering just for the sake of trying to perfect something that is already perfect."

You really don't know what you are talking about.
If you watch the last three SW movies you will see that GL knows nothing about making movies. He knows how to write a good story and furtunately for us a combination of tight budget, distributed creative control and more studio influence lead to the making of a masterpiece. George was convinced that because he didn't have an unlimited budget and full creative control the first film would be a flop, and until today he still doesn't like it. GL has proved over and over he has no talent for making movies and no eye for good taste. When he had an unlimited budget and full control he created the foul smelling abortion that became the last 3 films and not content to botch those 3 films he wants to go back in time and destroy the original 3."
,torrentinator69,2012-07-06T16:41Z,Thank you for these two Despecialized editions!! I have every edition of the movies that have come out since vhs except for dvd and the latest bundle of mess on blu-ray. I was watching star wars with my son and I had to constantly point out all the stuff that was not in the original as well as Han SHOT FIRST!! argh!! I love lucas and all but we need a high res version of the ORIGINALS!!!!!  
,theamericanstig,2012-08-10T00:44Z,"Thank you good sir for making and/or distributing this fine copy of the ORIGINAL Star Wars. It's not perfect, but damnit it's original art and it's how I remember it from my childhood! Suffice to say, I think Lucas has gone ""Vader"" and has no clue what he has done with his Empire. "
