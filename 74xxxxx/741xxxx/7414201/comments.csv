I used to complain also, .mp4 is just the way it is now :/
on the plus side, almost every portable device can play these and most video players these days don't have any issues.

If it really bothers you, you can just rename the file extension from "".mp4"" to "".avi"" if it's just aesthetic visual conformity you're looking for."
