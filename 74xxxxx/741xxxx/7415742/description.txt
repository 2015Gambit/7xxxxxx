American Weed
All-new series American Weed finds Colorado medical marijuana businesses under scrutiny and facing mounting pressures from local residents. Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fund-raisers. As the oldest of 11 kids, Josh relies heavily on several of his brothers to work at the grove and keep his business supplied in medical marijuana. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the ten-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado?
Episode 4: Buds on the Ballot
As election day nears, anxiety builds for those for and against the medical marijuana dispensary ban in Fort Collins, Colorado. Medical marijuana dispensaries are facing the possibility of extinction as the upcoming vote on Question 300 threatens to ban all dispensaries within city limits.
