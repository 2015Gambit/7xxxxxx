Note: quite a bad source here not the best
atall lol not even gona bother naming the
issues as this has alot but i'll point out
the main issues is the focus, object in the
screen though-out, missing the first 4mins
tryed to clean as much as i cud altered the
levels, colours, contrast, gamma, denoisers
etc pretty better but still shite either way
:lol: maybe for someone out there
