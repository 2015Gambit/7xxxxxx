,Trinitylynne,2012-07-20T23:49Z,"The languages are messed up on this game. The menu and all of the icons, and strategy guide are in english, as well as the cutscenes are spoken in english with Russian subtitles (I am guessing it's Russian because description below says it has both languages). However, when you open your journal (the word journal is written in english) it is all in russian. Also all of the written hints, cues, and instruction for mini games, when you click on an item, and the notes you find are all in russian. This makes it too difficult to play! Sucks because the game looks great! Very strange glitch-maybe a fix is possible? "
