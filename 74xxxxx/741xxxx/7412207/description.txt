From Crystal to Solution 
by 
G. A. Krestov, V. A. Kobenin and edited by P. B. Dobrotin.

The editor says in the Preface:

    Fascinated as we are with the perfect beauty of a snow flake, we must remember that when it melts on the palm to turn into water, its inner structure is not fully destroyed but only becomes invisible to the eye. The structure persists in the mutual arrangement of molecules, in the intricate ice-like structure of liquid water ...

    As substances dissolve in water, they occupy their own "apartments" in this invisible but orderly "molecular building" partly destroying its separate sections and partly introducing their own new order around the ions and molecules.

    So it is not for nothing that crystal and solution are put together in the title of this book. They are related and the modern scientist believes that the study of the close connections between them will give him the clue to understanding the nature of solution, which is perhaps the most important state of matter.

The book was translated from the Russian by A. Rosinkin and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1980.
