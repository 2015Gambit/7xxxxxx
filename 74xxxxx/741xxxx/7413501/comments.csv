,Naxell,2012-07-05T23:14Z,"Great patch... It improved my performance much :P But i have one problem. When i play I'm thrown out of the game into the Menu for no reason. I haven't done anything, i was just driving when this happens, so i have to start all over. Do somebody know why or have a fix? :P"
,besbeco,2012-07-06T20:14Z,I installed this patch and it worked well. But my keyboard stopped working. Could someone tell me what might cause it?!?
,moeburn1,2012-07-11T17:22Z,"Naxell, I'm having the same problem, I'll let you know if I find a fix.  It sounds like the crack is no longer working..."
,moeburn1,2012-07-28T10:25Z,"@Naxell and others, I found the solution to the problem of the game throwing you to the main menu after 30 seconds: You must delete your profile and make a new one :(

Your profile is the folder called ""2988734"" or whatever numbers it is for you.  It is found in this directory:
%userprofile%DocumentsSCANIA Truck Driving Simulatorprofile

Delete it, move it somewhere else, just get rid of it.  Then start Scania, make a new profile, and now you get to have all the fun of setting up all your options again, and then losing all your saved games and progress!  YAY!"
