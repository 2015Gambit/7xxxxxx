,RinTosaka,2012-07-06T20:47Z,"Well, I guess this is one way to solve the Panda Cloud installation problem.  At least it's still small enough to fit on a CD-RW!

Also, you should put the version number in the title to show which one it's based off of (v2 or v3?)"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-06T21:46Z,"no its not based on any previous version , i made specially for you from msdn original untouched refresh media version, build from scratch, but now i know presets and tweaks its done in no time 

making 32 bit is little easy then 64 bit ,just for sake of giving version no , in system property u will find name v3 with IE9 but it has nothing to do with v3 as adding IE9 to v3 is not possible for me  hope u enjoy this 
do tell me how u like it. "
,RinTosaka,2012-07-06T22:30Z,"Well, I probably won't install it just yet, since it's a bit of a pain to set up my filesystem before hand. (Symbolic Links to other partitions, which require me to take the HDD out and plug it into another PC)

If you want me to get it done quicker, than add the ""Link Shell Extension"" to your 'Win 7 live 64 bit with ghost' - this would make things SO much easier. (see my comment on that torrent's page for more info)"
,extracube,2012-07-07T21:44Z,"Hmm, this file is almost 100mb more just because it has IE9?  Are other things added to this one over the torrent you made last time, or is it only IE9 extra?"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-07T23:23Z,"Desktop sidebar and all gadget,IE9,XPS viewer,remote desktop connection,windows remote assistance,snipping tool,home group,

system files r not manually deleted u r right i can still squeeze this 70 80 mb more but do install if u really wants IE9 otherwise v3 is fine"
,RinTosaka,2012-07-08T03:33Z,"Did we really need all that other stuff just for IE?

Also, you STILL haven't responded to my comment on here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7327056/win_7_live_64_bit_with_ghost_by_nil"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-08T07:46Z,"@RinTosaka
i am trying for ur request give me some time ,i need switches for it to integrate,i am from medical (doc) field,not good at programming,if u know switches give me link ,
other work around open iso with ultra iso and copy required files into it and when ur os boots from it install required exe 32/64 bit with vcredist_x86/x64,files,they will be installed in ram as os runs from ram,finish ur work and reboot."
,extracube,2012-07-08T09:21Z,"Ok so this one has several extra gadgets, some that might be useful and some that I don't know about.  So for extra 100mb, it's probably better to get this one.  Snipping tool seems rather nice.  Thanks."

,nileshtambe,2012-07-11T06:14Z,"@littlehans2012 
all languages  r removed except us ENG u can try this software hope it helps u
Vistalizator http://www.froggie.sk/download.html"
,littlehans2012,2012-07-11T17:34Z,"i installed your system, and i really like it.
i tried visualizator, installed chinese language pack, changed display language, but did  not work.
and then i used eastasianfont.exe, logged off.
miracle happened. the system can display itself in chinese with some exception when i am installing some software.

maybe i should as well get started to do my own version, that would be fine. can you tell me how to slim down and tweak the system? it will be better if i make a chinese version just as good as your

if you are happy with that, just let me know.thanks a lot."
