,Iceburgslim,2012-07-06T20:30Z,IMDB is blank. lol They've never even heard of this movie!!!
,Warzone93,2012-07-07T09:27Z,wow just from the title it sounds like complete shit.
,Footie7,2012-07-07T23:47Z,"@Warzone93, from the name I thought it would be a terrible Syfy original movie or something, but IMDB says it's a documentary... so who knows. I could be decent, it's about giant snakes after all, how bad could it be?"

Second snake pic is Burmese Python.
I have both species, Florida can suck it!

Titanoboa is the name of the ancient giant snake,and this is a documentary about it.
