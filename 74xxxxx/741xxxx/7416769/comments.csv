,joanmcbitch,2012-07-14T01:21Z,I wonder if he feels the 'gringo' in the title of the film will remind people that it really is okay to murder Jews again.
,Pedrojkan,2012-07-15T09:06Z,"Just a terribly boring movie, couldn't watch the whole thing."
,pjones452,2012-07-16T12:42Z,"fuck you haters this was a great movie, dont judge a movie based on how you feel about one fucking actor in it. anyway liberals hate jews more than anyone else.

,MacThizzle,2012-07-22T03:30Z,"I'm so sick of IGNORANT people telling me what i'm going to think about the movie, if i'm hear i'm obviously interested! KEEP the IGNORANT a$$ comments to yourself, give a comment torward the quality of the movie! A/V NOT M! Maybe be nice and warn someone if you have downloaded and ran across cinavia! But NO ONE wants to hear how YOU feel about a movie! I can promise your NOT the critic ANYONE wants to listen to!"
,Powerslave0,2012-07-22T05:40Z,"The fact of the matter, Mel Gibson is a racist pig.  This was done BEFORE he really got out of hand.  No one wants to work with him anymore, and he continued to rant on the set of movies, for no reason.  Sure, he makes good movies, but it's hard to enjoy them knowing what a horrible person he is.  There is a book out, about him, by a man that lived with him for a few weeks.  Mel is an indecent human being.  He is a good actor, but a horrible person."
,Powerslave0,2012-07-22T05:44Z,"Lepoard: You need a receiver capable of DTS audio in order to not get Cinavia messages.  You are probably converting to AC3.  ALL SONY pictures will have Cinavia as well.  AS of now, PS3 cannot detect Cinavia over DTS.  I enjoy ALL these movies with DTS 3/2.1 sound tracks.  Do not blame the torrent owner, when YOU don't have the means to do it right.  You CANNOT remove cinavia, so it's not HIS fault..."
,Shadow416,2012-07-28T23:33Z,"i like mel's acting, i don't care about what kind of person he is. i simply don't give a fuck.

The movie was okay I give it a 6/10."
,HlTLER,2012-07-30T13:37Z,"Great movie and even better actor, he is very smart and competent, I tip my hat, good sir."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T10:57Z,"Good movie. Nice Flow. Would have been nice to know more about the main character. Over acting, ending is way too stretched. Would be nice if it ended differently. Max Payne style."
,puunjab,2012-08-17T02:23Z,"Video is a fucking 0 because 1280X534 is not 720p you fucking lying sack of shit.

1280X720 ring a bell???

Pull your head out of your ass next time, dipshit."
,Azuril,2012-08-24T18:23Z,"@puunjab

Did it occur to you, that before going on your uninformed tirade on the uploader, that the film is anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio - as seen in many feature releases nowadays?

That is to say - At 1280x720, the film will be in letterbox and be at its full aspect ratio.

So before you go calling someone a lying sack of shit - realize that the film is intended to be viewed at a 720p resolution with letterbox. 

A full screen 720p image would involve either zooming the picture and cutting off the ACTUAL picture at the sides, ruining the composition or at the very least stretching the image. either way you would be compromising on picture quality.

perhaps you should be pulling YOUR head out of your ass and put that cock back in your mouth before you say anything else as stupid as your last comment.
Fucking moron."
