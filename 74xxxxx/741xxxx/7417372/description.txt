Notes: Well quite abit of work went into this one. Video is not the best, had a
heavy flicker which we removed almost completely, but focus was the main issue
here. First 4 min is missing, nothing special happens anyway and a little cam
movement in the first couple min and there's an object throughout(check screens)
Made it watchable but check sample and the nice LiNE audio topped it off We
recommend watching as it's a funny ass film you'll watch more then once. Enjoy!
