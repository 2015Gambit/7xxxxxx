Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack is a soundtrack album released on 4 December 2006, containing incidental music composed by Murray Gold and used in the 2005 and 2006 series of Doctor Who.
The release included a fourteen-page booklet containing an introduction to the album by "Doctor Who" Executive Producer Julie Gardner, written on 8 November 2006; and four pages of comments on the contents of the album, written by Murray Gold in November 2006. The booklet also featured many publicity pictures, including a Cyberman, a Dalek ship, Matron Casp and the New Earth Hospital, the Doctor and Rose, and a Slitheen. The last page has a picture of Dalek Sec from "Doomsday".
It was originally released as a special limited edition, which featured a cardboard slipcase containing the jewel CD case, as well as a small badge featuring the Doctor and Rose, as seen on the cover artwork. In 2008 a new cover was released for this album, removing Rose and including a different picture of the Doctor.
