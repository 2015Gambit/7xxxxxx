Hermine Huntgeburth wrote and directed this German comedy-drama about a trio of travelers who veer their caravan toward pockets they can pick. Before Zobel (Gotz George) linked up with Karl (Christan Redl), he had a hetero lifestyle that brought him a daughter, Lizzi (Jeanette Hain). After Karl dies in a car accident, Rudolf (Felix Eitner) joins the team -- and both father and daughter take a sexual interest in Rudolf. Lizzi leaves, accusing Dad of using her to procure younger men. ~ Bhob Stewart, Rovi
