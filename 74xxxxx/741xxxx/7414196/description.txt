WORKDONE:

Ok we were kindly gives these lovely files  ....the video was nice and MUCH 
better than all the other sources out.
Still had some issues ...but worse part was the video noise.
Audio was inc and was english ac3 2.0 and syncd ...now the sync was good and the audio was really decent cam audio....however
it was quite loud and the levels were peaking alot,causing some distortion.

Took the video first and cleaned up the noise,thenn slightly changed the rgb colours and increased the sat.Then fine tuned the brightness and contrast levels,before finally adding some sharpness back.
Audio we opted too level the DBs by about -10 and then changed all the EQ bands 
and resaved as a mp3 file.
Just left then too mux the files together .
