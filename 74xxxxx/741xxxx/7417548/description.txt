Ken Boothe began his solo career cutting sides for Coxsone Dodd's Studio One imprint during the late-'60s, and earned the moniker "Mr. Rocksteady" for his notoriety during this period. Drawing considerable influence from American soul music of the time, Boothe's deep, robust style was in dramatic contrast to the harmonized falsettos that dominated rocksteady groups. EVERYTHING I OWN includes popular hits from his repertoire, as well as covers of well-known soul classics, including  ...  Bill Withers's "Ain't No Sunshine."
