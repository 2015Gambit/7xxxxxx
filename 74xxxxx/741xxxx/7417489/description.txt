Episode 14 : Human Torpedo Raiders

One of the most remarkable raiding weapons of World War 2 was the Italian Maiale human torpedo. On the night of December 18th, 1941, three of them fundamentally changed the balance of naval power by crippling the only British battleships remaining in the Eastern Mediterranean. This triumph was soon being copied as the British, Germans, and Japanese developed their own human torpedoes.
