This tape holds a special place in my heart to me, for many reasons.
Firstly, it was my first reel to reel tape. I got it at a train station flea market back in high school, just before I acquired my first vintage tape recorder, an old Akai from the 1960's. Played the heck out of this thing.
This tape was also the first major collection of Jazz music I've ever acquired, and introduced me to the giants of the Jazz era, ie. Parker, Ellington, Garner, Coltrane, etc. Which is now what I mainly listen to.

The tape, near the end, changes into a pretty Hi-FI stereo recording of Coltrane, as well as Kenny Burrell.

The tape was recorded at 3 3/4 ips, off of a radio broadcast. It sounds surprisingly listenable, considering it's lineage. There is some tape damage for the first/last 5 minutes. But it all sounds pretty good.

I no longer even have a tape machine with this slow speed, so I had to play it back at double speed during the transfer, and resample it on the computer. I recorded it initially at 96000 khz.
The final resolution of this file is 48000 khz, at 16 bits.
Front and back covers are included, as well as a scan of the reel itself.

Many of these classics have been long forgotten today.
At the very least, it's an interesting listen, a time capsule back into the days when commercial free radio was king.
But I guarantee that amongst the 192 minutes of music here, you'll discover something new that you'll absolutely love. Please seed this great music so that new generations of music lovers can enjoy these gems.



This will also be the first of many tape transfers I upload. I will be uploading VERY hi-rez (32/192) transfers of 4-track tapes, 2-track tapes, staggered head recordings, 15 ips masters, all kinds of stuff in the future. So stay tuned for future uploads.
