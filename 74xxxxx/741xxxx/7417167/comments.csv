,peilass,2012-08-09T16:54Z,Thank you -- it's perfect.
,peilass,2012-08-10T05:06Z,"Not only is it A10/V10, it's a fascinating movie with a terrific cast - a very original concept that works. Thanks again."
,guenloie,2012-09-10T18:44Z,"Downloaded very skeptically. Had that frustrating thing where it said ""2 minutes"" for about 40 minutes. Finished, logged in so I could make my comment of ""horrible copy.""

Was wrong. Ah well. Looks like a DVDrip or something. 10/10 from what I can tell. Thanks for the upload. "
