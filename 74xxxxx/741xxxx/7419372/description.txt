Get the Gringo (also known as How I Spent My Summer Vacation) is a 2012 American film starring Mel Gibson and directed by Adrian Grunberg.

The Gringo (Mel Gibson) is convicted and sent to a Mexican prison for stealing money from a crime boss. As he learns his way through the town-like prison, he meets a 10 year old boy who is special because he has a rare blood type and a Mexican crime boss in the same prison needs his liver. It is up to the titular gringo to save the boy's life and break out of prison.

If you do not want subtitles, Right Click, Subtitle, Disable.  However, there are various parts in Spanish, so I would recommend subtitles.  There are also English parts that are hard to understand because of Spanish accents.)
