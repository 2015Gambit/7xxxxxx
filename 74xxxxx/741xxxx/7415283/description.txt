Quote:
How does a staunch punk rationalist with a Charles Darwin tattoo deal with a Lovecraftian tar-like horror from the depths of hell? Well, maybe her unique interests are why she's the right girl for the job. In Aaron Alexovich and Drew Rausch's comic ELDRITCH!, said Darwin-fan Anya is put at odds with her demonically-possessed folklore-loving brother, all against the backdrop of generic suburban sprawl.
