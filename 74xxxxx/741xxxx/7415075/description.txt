Yuki Sanada is a high school student who lives with his grandmother, a woman whose career requires frequent relocation which prevents the boy from establishing any real friendships, much less the social skills necessary to initiate them. When ever he becomes anxious, he freezes in place, unable to breathe, donning a markedly demonic expressionΓÇöso potent with seemingly latent rage that others become wary of him at its appearance. Shortly after arriving at their home on the grandmother's most recently sanctioned work base, the island of Enoshima, a zealous transfer student named HaruΓÇöwielding a water gun and sporting a fish bowl atop his headΓÇöappears on their doorstep claiming to be an alien and that he will thenceforth be living in the same house; the grandmother agrees to allow such if Haru simply meets one condition (which is undisclosed to the audience). Haru's presence continually makes Yuki uncomfortable. The two also meet a secluded young fisher, Natsuki Usami, nicknamed "The Fishing Prince". An Indian boy named Akira watches Haru from a distance with his duck Tapioca.
