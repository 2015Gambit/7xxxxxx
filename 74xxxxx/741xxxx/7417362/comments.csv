,spaceballz2010,2012-07-06T08:45Z,"I dont care what quality it is, This movie looks like its gonna be off the chain.  Thanks TvTeam.  "
,nz77788,2012-07-06T08:57Z,I'd figure since TvTeam uploaded it it'll be the genuine thing unlike all these pointless fakes

,spaceballz2010,2012-07-06T09:50Z,"Audio is good give it a 8.  Video is a 5.  Its like watching tv on one of those big wooden tvs with the bunny ears, but the movie is kick ass.  This is rating is only for the first few min, clicked stream because i couldnt wait.  Will take a while to finish the download because there is way more leechers than seeders, again thank you so much this movie is so funny i could just listen to it with no video."
,spaceballz2010,2012-07-06T09:54Z,A9/V5.  Its like watching on one an old Big wooden TV with the bunny ears.  This rating is just from seeing the first 5 min through streaming it.  Im def gonna watch it.  Its free and hilarious and thats good enough for me.
,Ganja83,2012-07-06T09:54Z,"Yup, not at all fuzzy, TvTeam hooks it up once again!

,MethuselahMr,2012-07-06T10:43Z,Finally Thank you TvTeam.. Im tired of people posting bullshit its good to know there is some decent uploaders out there.. thanks again
,Zxain,2012-07-06T11:13Z,Holy shit the video quality is complete trash. The audio is okay at best.
,smknjoker,2012-07-06T14:17Z,Ted for president. Thank you all. could care less about quality honestly. How many here remember watching Football and everyone on the screen had a doppelganger
,shaie6,2012-07-06T15:16Z,"WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE UPLOAD FAKE, WHATS THE FUN IN WAITING AND UPLOADING SHIT LIKE THAT. AND LET ME TELL U THEY ARE ALSO UPLOADING CRAP LIKE THAT ON YOUTUBE, DIRECTING YOU TO THEIR STUPID ASS GAY WEBSITE THAT HAVE SURVEY BLOCKED ON THEM. FUCKIN SONS OF PENSIS. EAT CABBAGE AND SWOLLOW YOUR OWN VOMIT. "
,420Wizard,2012-07-06T15:33Z,come on seed people even if its not the best quality dont be assholes seed
,pablo16,2012-07-06T17:09Z,im new to the tpb and what is seeding?
,sarihaddu,2012-07-06T20:45Z,"To pablo16, seeding means sharing the file with others too.  Once u complete downloading the file, u will be known as a seed.  Instead of stopping the torrent after download finishes leave it til it uploads for 1:1 ratio, then only others also can download the file.  More seeds more speed.  Sharing is what keeps the torrent sites alive.  Happy sharing TPBians.

Oh and Welcome to TPB.. :)"
,mikemundzy,2012-07-07T05:27Z,doesnt even start from the actual beginning
,egg311,2012-07-07T07:38Z,"Thanks for the upload. It's missing the first 3 min maybe, and something's in the camera shot the whole time. Still well worth it. "
,jlemieuxjr,2012-07-07T13:36Z,worth watching considering its a comedy and you are more intune with the audio than video.. but wtf is that black thing in the bottom left corner? Hopefully that is only on the sample

Not the greatest video in the world but defientally better than paying 10 bucks at the movie theater"
,NuM_ChuX,2012-07-08T06:47Z,"I normally don't write a review on here, but this is shitty quality. I know it's free, so is my opinion. As soon as I turned it on I deleted it. It's like looking through frosted glass. I'd wait for a better copy.
