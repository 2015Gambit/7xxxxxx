,nazim12366,2012-08-06T00:23Z,"thanks to the uploader especially for the subtitles and for such a small file size. i just started downloading and i usually don't ask for this but people, could you please be kind and seed. even if it's only half or a quarter of what you download, seed! if everyone does that, this torrent will be alive and well and people will finish downloading quicker. :)"

screen quality is not 720p, hopefully you're not expecting it for this small size, but it is completely watchable. in season two, the video already includes subtitles in a different language which you can't turn off and the english subtitle overlapping makes it annoying. by the 3rd season, the uploader got lazy, i presume and didn't rename the subtitles to match the episode. the subtitles are also out of sync in most of the episodes.
