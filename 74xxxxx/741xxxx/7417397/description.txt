As the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's teddy bear, Ted, came to life and has been by John's side ever since - a friendship that's tested when Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, wants more from their relationship.



Well quite abit of work went into this one. Video is not the best, had a heavy flicker which
we removed almost completely, but focus was the main issue here.First 4 min is missing, nothing special happens
anyway and a little cam movement in the first couple min and there's an object throughout(check screens). Made it watchable but check sample and the nice LiNE audio topped it off. We recommend watching as it's a funny ass movie you'll watch more then once. Enjoy!
