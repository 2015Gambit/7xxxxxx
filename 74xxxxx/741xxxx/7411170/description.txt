Capabilities

    No messy installation or configuration required, just double-click the .EXE to start.
    Sharp, clean, and detailed video output every time.
    Your choice of MP4 or MKV container.
    Your choice of MP3 or AAC audio.
    Anamorphic video output (720 pixel width) with aspect ratio signalling.
    Chapters are created automatically and have perfect timecodes (official MeGUI builds do not).
    Perfect aspect ratio autodetection (official MeGUI builds have 3% horizontal stretching).
    Multithreaded deinterlacing (TempGaussMC) to take advantage of multi-core systems.

System Requirements

    Windows XP/2003 or higher
    15-25GB free space for temporary files that are created during encoding.
    An SSE3-capable multi-core CPU (the more cores the better! The deinterlacing used in meguIV is very demanding.)
    Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or higher (for example .NET 3.5). You probably already have it installed.

A short tutorial in RTF format is included in the torrent. Read it carefully!
