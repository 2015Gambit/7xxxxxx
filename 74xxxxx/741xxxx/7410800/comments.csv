,denys55,2012-09-15T16:12Z,"Hi Rafi,
First of all, thanks for your efforts. It's hard to get international versions of The Amazing Race.
As of September 15th there are no seeders for this torrent. I hope it becomes available. By the way, does this have English subtitles? My Hebrew is limited to ""shalom"" and ""mazel tov.""

I looked up another word. Toda for the upload. I hope we can work out the seeding problem."
