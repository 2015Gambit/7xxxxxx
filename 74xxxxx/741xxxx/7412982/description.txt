Paul Simon's Graceland album is one of his greatest achievements - a brilliant fusion 
of African rhythms and western pop which became a global phenomenon. It also proved 
hugely controversial, as Simon broke the UN-backed cultural boycott of a country still 
under the grip of apartheid.

Joe Berlinger's film captures Simon's return to South Africa 25 years on and contrasts 
the value of individual artistic expression versus collective political action as 
instruments of change. Did Paul Simon's unique collaboration with South Africa's township 
musicians set back the clock of South African liberation or drive it forward ?
