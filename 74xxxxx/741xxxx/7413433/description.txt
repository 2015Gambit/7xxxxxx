Episode 11 : The Schweinfurt Raid

On August 17th, 1943, the 8th US Army Air Force launched its first major long-range bombing raids into the heartland of Nazi Germany. The American belief that its heavily-armed Flying Fortresses could fight their way through in daylight without escorts to any target was facing its crucial test. As Luftwaffe fighters swooped on the US bombers it became horrifyingly clear that the theory was wrong.
