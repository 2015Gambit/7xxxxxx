Synopsis:
Left on the doorstep of an orphanage run by nuns, newborns Moe, Larry and Curly grow up finger-poking, nyuk-nyuk-nyuking and woo-woo-wooing their way to uncharted levels of knuckleheaded misadventure. Now their childhood home may have to close due to financial difficulties. But Larry, Curly and Moe, employed as the foster homeΓÇÖs inept maintenance men, are determined to come to the rescue. Only The Three Stooges could become embroiled in an oddball murder plot ΓÇô while stumbling into starring roles in a phenomenally successful TV reality show.
