Lily LaBeau and her fiance are taking a look at the house they plan on buying, and Lily is surprised to see that the seller is her old boyfriend from high school, Mick! But neither she nor her old beau say anything in front of her fiance or the realtor while visiting the home. But as soon as Lily's groom-to-be takes off for a meeting, the realtor gets the vibe that Mick and Lily are more than old acquaintances, and she skee-daddles. Lily doesn't care that Mick's now married ΓÇª she misses his big dick, so she sits on it for old time's sake!
