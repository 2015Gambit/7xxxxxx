Episode 10: Cabin Fever
The Orange County 'Wives go camping or, more accurately, "glamping."

Alexis plans a glamorous camping (aka "glamping") trip near Santa Barbara for all the girls, but with her Pussycat Dolls performance only days away, Gretchen decides to skip the trip. Tamra, also staying home as she recovers from her breast implant removal surgery, is paid a visit by Vicki, who reveals that she's becoming friends with Alexis. Skeptical of this newfound friendship, Tamra doesn't believe for one second that Vicki will survive a night with Alexis in the woods. During the glamping trip, will the housewives relish nature or long for the luxuries they're accustomed to?
