The gateway to the Netherworld has fractured, and this fracture may soon grow into a gap now that Nefer has recovered the Sword of Hermes.

Not long ago, when the great hero Acharon united Glenheim out of chaos and forced Nefer to retreat, Glenheim seemed safe.

But now our nightmare has returned...

Long ago, the Sword of Hermes was hidden away on Henko Island where, and over time, Rahkdan, the Lord of Destruction, managed to transform NeferΓÇÖs thirst for it into corrupted ambition.

Soon after that, Akene protected humankind during the first of the two Genesis Wars as Rahkdan sought to open the Nethergate and welcome his followers into this world.

Eventually, Rahkdan fell to AkeneΓÇÖs spear and was sealed away, but his sword and traces of his

black rocks still remain scattered across the land.

RahkdanΓÇÖs death brought an end to the Genesis War, but humans and monsters began to fight each other to secure new territory. Over time, they forgot about the Sword of Hermes and the black rocks, but the desire still burned deep within NeferΓÇÖs heart.

Now, Nefer has recovered the sword and is using its power to destroy the seal protecting the Nethergate. He wishes to release RahkdanΓÇÖs followers so that they may once again unleash fury upon the world.

Fortunately, the Ninth Continent, where the Gate stands, is protected by legions of elves and powerful magicians. Nevertheless, even our strongest warriors may still not be able to halt NeferΓÇÖs onslaughtΓÇª

It is up to you to prove your worth as a hero. You must hasten to the Ninth Continent and halt NeferΓÇÖs advance, before it is too late.
