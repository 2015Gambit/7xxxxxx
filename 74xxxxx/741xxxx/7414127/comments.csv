,bbllplaya,2012-07-18T16:20Z,All i know is that it does not work with 2011 because it will not take anything over a 6 groups of numbers/letters .. the text file shows 8 groups
,bbllplaya,2012-07-18T16:26Z,sorry meant to say it wont take more than 7 groups
,WPX_TacoMan477,2012-08-07T08:14Z,is this safe? what happens if avg catches people using the same key? wont they notice?
,kolagen,2012-08-09T00:06Z,"Yes,they are noticing.When they do you are back to trial."
,Hiscore,2012-08-10T16:38Z,I got sent back to trial version after about two months of using this.  Great job though.
