There was a loss of my DirecTv HD Satellite service due to a power failure outage 
here in my area yesterday which lasted for more then 8 hours and that is why I couldn't capture and upload WWE Monday Night Raw SuperShow 2012-07-02 last night.  
Sorry for the problem but sometimes as the old saying goes "shit happens". I ended uphaving to download the WWE Monday Night Raw show off the usenet earlier today just so I could see last night's WWE Monday Night Raw Supershow. 

This is SDH release #770  for the wrestling fans from a wrestling fan. First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 6,000 kbps from the 1920 x 1080i HD source on 07/03/2012 on the SyFy HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite then converted to 16:9 widescreen 1280 x 720p resolution Framerate is 59.940 with an average Video Bitrate of 5000 kbps in a High Quality 2.82 GB 720p H264 AVCHD Blu-Ray MKV release with 48khz 384 kbps AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 channel audio show runtime 1 Hour 26 minutes 10 seconds

This is my 35th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show WWE wrestling fans. 


To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesnt play the video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player does.
 

Enjoy the WWE Super Smackdown Great American Bash show wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my WWE Super Smackdown Great American Bash 2012-07-03 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH mkv release.
