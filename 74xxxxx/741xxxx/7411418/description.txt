Classic UFO Docus Colllection (70s-90s) xvid avi

I noticed the copies floating about the web youtube and p2p werent
as good as my recovered VHS 70-90s UFO collections and
so I thought i share one last big UFO collection

You may especially want the Classic Live UFO cover up hosted
by one of the mash actors.. when Gulf breeze was a hot spot
with guest gov agents that come on to spill the beans.. (alas
it didnt do much.. that was in 70s.. 30 years ago and still nothing
new has happen but it a must have for your collections)

and the classic one with rod sterling voice over (same as in search of
series with creepy electronic music) the outer space connection
2nd must have for UFO colllections :))
