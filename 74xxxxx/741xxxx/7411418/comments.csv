[V],psspss,2012-07-05T05:24Z,"lol yet i have people pming (at demon) about wanting missing eality episodes or shows

 well 30 now have it.. took 5gb to seed this out 

I spent a whole day ripping these of tape.. 
its good to see how ufo doco progressed over the years..
I was upset to see the only NZ cases docu destroyed. maybe the gov wipe it will a laser beam LOL.. but it feature 3 ufo cases in NZ which is rare to hear of and see real accounts before the people died

I wonder what the ufo live one was about I remember
it was airing in different countries all at the same time.. it was like everyone expecting the gov to come clean about a ufos coming in mass numbers.. or to expose the truth of ets LOL

maybe one day it happen for real"
