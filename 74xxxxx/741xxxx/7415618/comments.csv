Please post the Set's COVER in your torrent listing, it would help a lot."

Your search did not match any torrents. = No contribution

FYI Marking down a torrent simply because you are ignorant is not a contribution.

My links All lead to legitimate Met Art pages for a reason.

No Malware No virus No risk of any kind. 

One Click takes you to the correct page  and a scroll down takes you to the  respective model.

Simple stuff, and no  Webhosting sites full of BS Malware.

The time to get   down to the model is a lot more than simply putting the cover shot of the model in the torrent. Many of us are familiar with certain models and seeks certain ones out, so not having to filter down the web page would be a lot easier. Virtually all other Met-Art posters do it the simple way, and it works."

Murphy is right. If you're going to do something, do it correctly. Otherwise you're just trashing up the site."
