,CaptainEvil83,2012-07-07T16:55Z,if the video is really that bad......it's sorta irrelevent how good the audio is.....ffs!
,smknjoker,2012-07-07T19:08Z,"It's just nice to know when a new video source does come out, that there is already above average audio available. 

For instance look up the latest uploads for The Amazing Spiderman. Everyone's everyone upset because there's no english audio."
,car1015,2012-07-07T20:48Z,I can't believe that nobody has the amazing spiderman in english.
,treecheetaholo,2012-07-11T23:16Z,"They do have the Amazing Spiderman its the 400mb one. 

Idk guys im seeing alot of regular uploaders here but if the movie is unwatchable and u cant hear it theres no point. And for guys uploading the same crap file over and over its just spamming PB"
