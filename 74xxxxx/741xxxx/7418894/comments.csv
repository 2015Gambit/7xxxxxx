Seems to be only one with that problem"
,Robspace1,2012-09-02T18:28Z,"Thank You-Rudurall! NOS always gets it right! It took 24 hrs. to dl, but it installed in about 1 hour and starts up just fine. I'm seeding now, and will for a day or two. I have a very fast system, and it took one day to get, so be patient folks. This is over 15gb. when done!"
,Robspace1,2012-09-02T23:45Z,"Radurall, it would be great if you could make Max Payne 3 available. The ones now available are either not working or the instructions are wrong and/or not complete. Your uploads make it super easy and they work. Thanks again and it would be nice if people that dl would be more patient and appreciate the gift their given, and cut the whining! nosTeam Rocks!"
