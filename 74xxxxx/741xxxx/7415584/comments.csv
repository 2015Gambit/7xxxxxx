,Nayati13,2012-07-06T16:40Z,"Thanks for the uploads! Loved the first one and seeded it. But I've been stuck at 50% for the past 12 hours. Please seed, thanks!"
,torrentinator69,2012-07-06T16:41Z,Thank you for these two Despecialized editions!! I have every edition of the movies that have come out since vhs except for dvd and the latest bundle of mess on blu-ray. I was watching star wars with my son and I had to constantly point out all the stuff that was not in the original as well as Han SHOT FIRST!! argh!! I love lucas and all but we need a high res version of the ORIGINALS!!!!!  
,Nayati13,2012-07-06T21:02Z,"Much props to uploader but... 50+ seeders and not a single one contributing to the torrent? Come on, share the wealth guys. "
,moaradin,2012-07-07T11:32Z,"Don't worry guys, I'll re-seed this torrent soon. Been busy past couple days so I couldn't seed it."
,frailwordscollapse,2012-07-09T22:39Z,"Thanks for uploading the good old originals! Plz upload Return of the Jedi soon, I hate the version where it shows Hayden Christensen at the end."
,D932,2012-07-20T21:34Z,"Return of the Jedi please!! I freaking hate the crap they did to it, most of all the ending with lame ass Hayden Christensen.... "
,frailwordscollapse,2012-07-21T17:09Z,"I don't want to sound ungrateful, but it's downloading at 0.2 kbs...leechers much?"
,flemsus,2012-07-21T19:04Z,"I would still like to know where the subtitle is?????

,frailwordscollapse,2012-07-22T04:31Z,"Please, people, seed both this and Return of the Jedi. If you are a leecher you are an unproductive asshole. "
