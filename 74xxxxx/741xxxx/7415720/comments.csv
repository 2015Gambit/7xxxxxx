[T],rjordan21,2012-07-06T20:41Z,"^^^ forget about dynamic range, mastering, etc. and listen to the music.  For me, vinyl always sounds like real music comparative to digital.... there's more air, space, it sounds like these guys have been playing together for 30+ years! It's easier to follow Geddy's bass lines, Neil's complex fills....

The only substitute for good vinyl is live music. "
