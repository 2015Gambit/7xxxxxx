  If you name an electro album after a John Fante novel, you're asking for it. And indeed, it's hard to see what Lorn's getting at with that comparison, assuming that some kind of comparison or connection is implied, although there's a gloominess at the heart of both the novel and this album that proves a pretty tenuous link. That said, the music really is very good. The tracks are shot through with melodies that at first seem incidental, like the kind of sampled scraps that most producers will use for filler or ambience, but if you keep listening you eventually realize that they're central to the attractiveness of this sometimes desolate but consistently interesting music. Overall, Ask the Dust is one of the more interesting and compelling electro albums of 2012.
