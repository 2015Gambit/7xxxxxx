,Leve17en,2012-07-06T02:37Z,Seed! I can't carry my swarm alone.
,RogerMadoff,2012-07-15T08:24Z,"This torrent is not only up-to-date but it has high-quality scans of the early volumes! Most copies of volumes 1-3 on the net are tiny blurry images, but not these ones.

I'm seeding this to 20.0. Thank you!"
,Leve17en,2012-07-26T05:17Z,Uploading V37 C330 today.

How up to date is this? This is the only manga I read but I'm not sure how to acquire the latest chapters."
,Leve17en,2012-08-11T17:53Z,It is up to date give or take two chapters. Google Evil Genius if you want to find the source of many scanalations.
