i can't imagine why this was added.
for those that do not know ?
the original release was nuked for..
""invalid.rar.size""
The scene rule that was broken..
(rar.sizes.that.are.multiples.of.50mb.must.contain.atleast.10.files)

so if your like me and you downloaded the first torrent i would say don't waste your time re-downloading..
the video's like this one are already un-rar'd before adding the torrent
so this nuke makes no difference..

The video inside both torrents is the same.

Thanks eztv and i guess i understand why you uploaded.. probably eases a bit of confusion while adding a little too lol

I hope my comment was helpful and saved some people some time and bandwidth etc"
