Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix is a remix album by Michael Jackson. The album is made up of eight remixes from Jackson's previous studio album HIStory, and five new songs. Jackson was heavily involved with the production of the new material while the remixes were produced by other artists. The new material dealt with themes such as drug addiction, women and paranoia.
The album received minimal promotion by Jackson's standards, particularly in the US. Still, a film, two singles ("Blood on the Dance Floor" and "HIStory/Ghosts") and three music videos were issued as promotion. Reviews at the time of release were largely mixed, some critics felt that Jackson had already explored these musical themes while others criticized what they perceived as weak vocals. Other critics were favorable, with praise issued for similarities to the music of Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor.
Worldwide sales stand at six million copies as of 2009, making it the best selling remix album ever released. Several contemporary critics view the material in an increasingly favorable light and believe the album could have been more successfulΓÇöcommentators argue that certain sections of the world took interest in tabloid stories about the singer's personal life over his musical career.
