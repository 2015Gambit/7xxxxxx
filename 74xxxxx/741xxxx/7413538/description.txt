Letur-Lefr is a forthcoming 5-song EP by John Frusciante, scheduled for release on July 4th, 2012 in Japan, and for international release on July 17th, 2012 on Record Collection. It will be released in multiple formats including 32-bit digital formats and cassette.[1] Recorded in 2010, it features Frusciante singing, playing all the instruments and engineering, as well as "a few friends on vocals, mostly MCΓÇÖing".[2]

Frusciante said of this album and its follow-up PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone "I consider my music to be Progressive Synth Pop, which says nothing about what it sounds like, but does describe my basic approach. I combine aspects of many styles of music and create my own musical forms by way of electronic instruments. The tracks on Letur-Lefr are from 2010 and PBX was made in 2011. Letur is a compilation, a selected portion of music I made that year while PBX was conceived as an album, the songs having been recorded in succession. The records are very different from each other."
