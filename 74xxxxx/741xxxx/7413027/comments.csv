Cam ratings
video 7/8 slight dark, slight blur but VERY good for a cam. Might give you a headache on a 60"" TV, but looks great on my 22"" LCD monitor.

audio 3/4 well, you can hear it. but, it's out of sync and rather full of echoes. sync can be fixed in VLC, the echoes are horrible if you have a sub woofer, and surround sound."

,Plan9x128,2012-07-10T15:03Z,Video is good [8/10] and Audio is a total shit [2/10]. Non-native English speaker will not even understand a word.
