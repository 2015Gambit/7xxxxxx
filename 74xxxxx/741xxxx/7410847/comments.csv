,spiderman-._.-ax,2012-07-10T08:50Z,"plot: Joshua Mason (Josh Hutcherson) is a troubled 15-year-old who is abandoned and finds himself in Carmel, California. Being an incredible art prodigy, Joshua gets introduced to the world of art forgery. While there, he befriends a retired artist named Annemarie Sterling (Lauren Bacall) who recalls the early days of Carmel artists and their legacy of artistic integrity."
,Rush,2012-07-11T03:28Z,"@twi666788, wha?.... Carmel CA. doesn't have a huge anything. The population is less than 4000 and their crime rate is well below the national average for almost all crimes. 

It's one the cleanest, friendliest cities in Cali, I've been there 5 times and all you see is rich fucks in Ferrari's and Lambo's. 

Probably takes 2 or 3 cops to cover the whole town. Not sure what this movie is trying to depict, haven't watched it yet."
