,dubblue4,2012-07-04T11:47Z,good stuff. thank you.
,Fuzakenaideyo,2012-07-04T14:21Z,"Thanks. One thing, you are representing this as a dvdrip and, if I am not mistake, this is not. Audio is so cam."
[H],tykoon123,2012-07-04T14:40Z,This is Region 5 DVDrip buddy :)
,ag_orange,2012-07-04T15:39Z,A/V?
,jmchip1,2012-07-04T16:51Z,"Many thanks for the upload!

The audio is definitely cam.

V 6 / A 3"
,jmchip1,2012-07-04T17:55Z,"Or if it's not a cam audio source, sounds very similar."
,ag_orange,2012-07-04T18:16Z,Ok...tnx--I'll wait for better quality....
,asasfly,2012-07-04T19:00Z,Is not DVD !!
,kazmandu,2012-07-04T19:40Z,"R5 just means it is dvd from the europe region. If it has cam quality in any way it is not R5. Fuckheads.  

Thanks for the up tho, mad props"
,pinzmoo,2012-07-04T22:06Z,"this should be labeled R5 only not a dvd quality rip. cam audio falls out of sync as the movie progresses aswell.

starting from the beginning I had to check my vlc settings cuz i thought I hit the forward speed but settings were fine, feels like its working at 1.5 speed, cuz of this i feel v6,a5 (cuz out of sync)

one thing I wish would stop on this sight is all the  calling of dvdrips when they are not, at all its the same shit as tc2dvdr people see that and actually thing its dvd quality when its far from it, just call it a fucking R5, or TCrip.

and before people start talking shit to me about not being grateful (which I am) right there in your tags The raven 2012 dvdrip so when you tell someone ""This is Region 5 DVDrip buddy :)"" then put that as the fucking tag  but here is your tag ""The raven 2012 dvdrip"" THIS IS NOT DVD QUALITY AT ALL."

V:2

This is not a DVDrip."
,PokerPimp,2012-07-05T15:30Z,"Ok, I know the difference between R5 and DVD... it is a DVDrip from Europe with cam English audio... BUT... why is everyone still giving 6 for Video.. a dvd (even if its from Europe) should still have good video (like 9) and bluray 10? I do not understand why such a low video rating because the audio is bad..."
,UrF4CEizN00B,2012-07-06T17:45Z,"Props tykoon 123 for being the first one to have ENGLISH version up.  I downloaded it just 5 min after you uploaded it, good quality.  People bitch bout someone putting up a english version forever and then someone finally does and now they bitch bout the audio lmao."
,Sovix,2012-07-07T03:42Z,Another mislabeled pos Cam audio like all the others
,slasherman,2012-07-07T19:11Z,"Video: 8
Audio: 2"
,iamjustinb,2012-07-10T18:28Z,"You know whats weird. this didn't have a video to it for me, Just sound o.O whats up with that?"
