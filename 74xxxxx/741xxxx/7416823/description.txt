Hidden Track:
Three separate tracks from the latest Tool album can be assembled into a different one. The hidden song can be heard by changing the order and playing them at the same time. The songs in question are "10 000 days" (11:13), "Wings For Marie" (6:11) and "Viginti Tres" (5:02). When you take the sum of 5:02 and 6:11 you get 11:13 which is exactly the length of "10 000 days". The order in which they should be played is first "Viginti Tres" and after it "Wings For Marie" all while "10 000 days" is playing.
