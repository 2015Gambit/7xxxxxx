Gettysburg is a 1993 American war film. It is based on the novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara, a historical fiction writer, about the decisive Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. The film adaptation was written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and produced by Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz. Randy Edelman composed the score. The film stars Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels and Martin Sheen, and tells the story of the Union and Confederate armies during this pivotal battle of the war.

Though it did poorly at the box office, Gettysburg has been highly praised by critics.

NOTE - There are many seeds of this out there, but I have yet to find one in Hi-Def that included all extras. Thus, I made my own.
