Description:
Foreigner is the self-titled debut studio album by rock band Foreigner, released in 1977.
Although punk rockΓÇÖs furious revolution threatened to overthrow rockΓÇÖs old guard in 1977, bands like Foreigner came along and proved that there was plenty of room in the marketplace for both the violent, upstart minimalism of punk and the airbrushed slickness of what would be called ΓÇ£arena rock.ΓÇ¥ Along with Boston, Journey, Heart, and others, Foreigner celebrated professionalism over raw emotion. And, looking back, itΓÇÖs easy to see why they sold millions; not everyone in the world was pissed off, dissatisfied with the economy, or even necessarily looking for a change. In fact, for most suburban American teens, ForeignerΓÇÖs immaculate rock sound was the perfect soundtrack for cruising through well-manicured neighborhoods in their Chevy Novas. The album spawned some of the biggest FM hits of 1977, including the anthemic ΓÇ£Feels Like the First TimeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Cold as Ice,ΓÇ¥ both of which were anchored ΓÇö like most of ForeignerΓÇÖs songs ΓÇö by the muscular but traditional riffing of guitarist Mick Jones, the soaring vocals of Lou Gramm, and the state-of-the-art rock production values of the day, which allowed the band to sound hard but polished. As pure rock craftsmanship goes, Foreigner was as good as it got in the late ΓÇÖ70s.
