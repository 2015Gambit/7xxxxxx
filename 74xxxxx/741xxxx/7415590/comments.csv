I am using XP SP3 32-bit. Will I have to activate the product key within a month or the version is cracked? Can I get a product key?"

"
,m2lnc,2012-07-16T01:28Z,"Everytime I open it I get a message saying 'Product Activation Required. this product is unlicensed. Connect to your corporate network or contact your system administrator for further assistance'
What do I do?"
,wndead,2012-07-28T18:14Z,"I have the same problem, but I think an external program (tune up utilities) might have done this. the office programs started demanding for activations after some registry cleanup that tune up utilities performed. I'm not sure if this is really the case, but I think it was suspicious that an activation was needed after tu-u did its thing. anybody?"
,LJE111,2012-08-04T00:03Z,"It would be nice if the uploader would take the time to respond to the activaton problems. 

This could be a HOAX."
,quest42,2012-08-10T10:04Z,Same here. Activation required.
,BayAreaWhiteBoy,2012-08-12T05:56Z,"The torrent worked surprisingly flawlessly.  I had hacked CD Product keys on the side ready to go, but after installation, all components of Microsoft Office were perfectly operable, and didn't even need activation.  What a GREAT file!!!!  Enjoying Microsoft word, Excel, and Powerpoint for free.  Saved me a lot of money for college!

Running Windows 7, 64 bit "
,BayAreaWhiteBoy,2012-08-12T06:01Z,Works perfectly!!!! No activation!!!!  Great torrent
