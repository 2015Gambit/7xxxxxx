Also, disregard the install instructions saying not to update. I had version 4.0.941 installed before and just swapped the file ""YNAB.swf""; presto it is registered. "

,Ghost2R1,2012-07-27T17:34Z,"So far this works for Mac. I just downloaded the Mac trial from the website. Make sure to quickly open and close it prior to entering any budget info. Find the YNAB program in your applications folder, right click, and select ""show package contents."" Once in the window navigate to""contents"" and ""resources."" Once in the resources window, copy and paste the YNAB.swf file in this torrent, so it replaces the current YNAB.swf file. 

THANKS, ONCE AGAIN, FOR THIS TORRENT"

Encrypt it with Blowfish + CBC using the key CHANGEDFORYNAB4WEKNOWTHISISN'TSECUREBUTIFTHEYAREUSINGAKEYGENTHEYWOULDNTBUYITANYWAY and with the Initialization Vector Ë>ÙWvä[¾=²
Ecrypt that with base32 encryption and you get a working key."
,tanu_dutta,2012-09-09T12:49Z,@DeanTheMachine : But the vector (Ë>ÙWvä[¾=²) is greater than 8 bytes...I thought the vector is supposed to be 8 bytes.
