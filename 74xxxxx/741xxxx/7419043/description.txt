UB40 - Astro (The Customized Greatest Hits)

UB40's resident toaster, percussionist, occassional trumpet player and vocalist Astro had provided the band with a number of excellent hit singles over the years and some of the finest are gathered together here, given a little customized mixing and presented in this "Greatest Hits" selection.

Astro (aka Terence Wilson) has been a member of UB40 since the bands formation in 1978, and appeared on the bands debut album "Signing Off" released in 1980.
He adds to the group his toasting (rapping/MC) skills, influenced no doubt by the early jamaican DJ's such as U-Roy, Big Youth and Prince Jazzbo, who would get the crowds moving in the dancehalls by rapping over instrumental or dub tracks.
Astro would also occassionally play percussion and trumpet, as well as providing backing vocals.
He has appeared on every UB40 album throughout the bands career and been lead vocalist on a number of songs including "Rat In Mi Kitchen" and "Wear You To The Ball".
