PLOT :: A depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on
        the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem. The story opens in the Garden of
        Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by
        Judas Iscariot, the controversial Jesus--who has performed 'miracles' and
        has publicly announced that he is 'the Son of God'--is arrested and taken
        back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There, the leaders of the
        Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently, his
        trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death...
