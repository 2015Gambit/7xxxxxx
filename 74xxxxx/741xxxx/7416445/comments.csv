,appuuu,2012-07-08T05:19Z,thanks AB bhai for this wonderful and rare movie. When I think of the movies of the present I can only think that how novice are the director of the present when compared to directors of 70s and 80s. And no doubt Om Puri is the best artist Indian cinema has ever produced.Second is Nasseruddin Shah.
