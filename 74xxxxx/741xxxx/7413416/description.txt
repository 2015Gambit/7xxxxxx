Plot:
-----
While observing the peaceful Ba'ku people on their planet, Lieutenant Commander
Data (on secondment to the duck blind mission there) appears to malfunction, 
revealing the hidden presence of the joint Federation and Son'a task force 
to the Ba'ku. Admiral Matthew Dougherty requests the help of the starship 
USS Enterprise-E to help capture or disable Data. Admiral Dougherty's allies,
the Son'a, are a decrepit race using various medical techniques to cheat death,
repeated face lift surgeries giving them a mummified appearance. After stopping
Data, USS Enterprise captain Jean-Luc Picard becomes suspicious of Dougherty's 
insistence that the Enterprise is no longer needed, and his crew investigates 
the cause for Data's malfunction.
