Another selection of my favourite house tracks, mixed June 2012.  

Starts off with progessive style house before moving onto some stompin', bangin' house tracks.  A couple of classic trance tracks thrown in for good measure.

Runs for just over two hours.  Mixed for my good mate Mike "Twist Mick" Carr.
