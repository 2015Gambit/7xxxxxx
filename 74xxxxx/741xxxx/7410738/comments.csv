,kevx74,2012-07-04T06:11Z,"The show is supposed to be live yet was uploaded an hour before conclusion. Might be I'm wrong but a few confirmations would be nice, otherwise I'll wait for a vip or trusted uploader."
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-04T06:16Z,Very much welcome. :)

I think I'm going to stop. If I continue, I'll only be doing RAW, but wrestling torrents don't get enough seeds(Unless PPV) and it is too time intensive on me. Unless it was in high demand, I can't really continue it. And RAW is going to 3 hours, so it's going to be even worse on me. "
