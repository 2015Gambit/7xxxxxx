,pinkSmoke,2012-08-01T12:35Z,how to install
,LavaWave,2012-08-20T10:32Z,"According to the official FAQ from the main website of this mod, it say's it's only supported for the steam version of the game as it uses the program to launch the servers and connection with each other, I never tried this mod tough so idk, it may work with a cracked version but it will be buggy."
,krftdnr,2012-08-25T00:20Z,What do you set the path to in the launcher?
,Infalli,2012-09-09T09:57Z,"How to get it working with a cracked version:
1) Install steam
2) Copy just cause 2 files to C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommon (Or wherever you installed steam to)
3) Start multiplayer mod
4) Choose destination
Enjoy :)"
