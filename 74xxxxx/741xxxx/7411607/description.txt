  Long before personal computers and the instantaneous connectivity of the internet made bedroom recording a widely accepted method of music-making, a much smaller scene of home recording artists existed in the margins of even the most fringe scenes. In the late '80s and early '90s, small runs of homemade cassettes were the primary vehicle for the homespun songs of artists like Lou Barlow, R. Stevie Moore, early artifacts of K Records and the Pacific Northwest scene, and John Darnielle's literary story songs as the Mountain Goats. Darnielle issued cassette-only albums prolifically, recording the wordy and wistful songs on boomboxes or other rudimentary equipment and releasing them with little fanfare as he continued to hone his craft and add to his discography. This remastered reissue of Hound Chronicles/Hot Garden Stomp represent some of the earliest Mountain Goats material, originally issued on cassette form on the California tape label Shrimper in 1991 and 1993, respectively. What's most immediately striking is how similar the early Mountain Goats sound is to that of Darnielle's music 20-plus years later. Though filtered through audible buzzing from whatever mechanism was putting it to tape, "Spilling Toward Alpha" has the same defeated-yet-hopeful ire and reluctant romanticism that runs through the best Mountain Goats material of any era.
