Hello again Folks :)
This is the same as my previous upload of the soundtrack, with the inclusion of the soundtrack of Wrath of The Lamb (The last 10 songs). Probably one of the coolest indie game soundtracks to date. Enjoy.
The main song you hear in the caves is Sacrificial, and Penance, clear highlights of the soundtrack

     The Binding of Isaac Soundtrack full album comprises of 37 tracks. It was composed by Danny Baranowsky For the Indie game Steam hit 'The Binding Of Isaac. It comes included with the Limited/Special edition from steam. If you wish support the indie community by buying the album for around $0.99
