Description:
Piano Man is a rock album by Billy Joel, released in 1973.
Piano Man, JoelΓÇÖs second album and his first with Columbia Records, emerged out of legal difficulties with his former label, Family Productions, and became his breakthrough album. However, the Family Productions print logo was still used until 1986.
The album was strongly influenced by Elton JohnΓÇÖs Tumbleweed Connection and has a western theme in much of the music and lyrics. Lyrically, this is most noticeable in ΓÇ£The Ballad of Billy the KidΓÇ¥, musically in ΓÇ£Captain JackΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Stop in NevadaΓÇ¥, and instrumentally in ΓÇ£TravelinΓÇÖ Prayer.ΓÇ¥
The single ΓÇ£Piano ManΓÇ¥, a fictionalized retelling of JoelΓÇÖs days as a lounge singer in Los Angeles, peaked at #25 on BillboardΓÇÖs Pop Singles chart, and at #4 on the Adult Contemporary singles chart. ΓÇ£TravelinΓÇÖ PrayerΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Worse Comes to WorstΓÇ¥ peaked at #77 and #80, respectively, on the Pop Singles chart, while the album hit #27 on the Pop Albums chart. (ΓÇ£TravelinΓÇÖ PrayerΓÇ¥ would later earn Dolly Parton a Grammy, when she covered it in 1999.)
