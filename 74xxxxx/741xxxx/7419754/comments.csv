Is it just me or is this torrent now broken...in bittorrent it shows 0 of 0 seeds, even though both utorrent and bittorrent are seeding them and even the peers field are wrong 0 of 4 connected when in utorrent it shows 0 of 2 seeds/0 of 6 peers-leeches.  Swarms are 3 in swarm for seeds and 1 in swarm for peers.

This torrent when I first uploaded it to KAT worked fine...people were connecting to me and downloading/uploading it, but now something appears to be wrong.

Sorry for wall of text comment, I felt I needed to explain why I uploaded this here too."
,SolariStar,2012-07-07T02:45Z,"To add to the last comment.

How many seeds and peers do you see?

The:
Seeds:  *#* of *insert amount of seeds here* connected (*#* in swarm)
Peers:   *#* of *#* connected (*#* in swarm)
(this may vary on what torrent client you are using)"
,SolariStar,2012-07-07T04:27Z,"Seems like uploading it here did the trick...the seeds and peers amounts got a kick in the rear after being uploading it here.

Disregard the first two comments.

To other commenters, how does it sound?  Is the quality good?"
