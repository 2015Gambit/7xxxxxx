We're halfway there with release 6, so grok the upbeat as we continue our adventure into the interesting life and ruminations of Terence Mckenna, who once coined the phrase; "Find the others", which we take very seriously, so listen out for the signal we've broadcast, an APB to your pineal informing you of what has to be done in order for us to have fun and survive as a species.

The entire audio track is once again (Thanks to Cybershaman Ernie Vega) encoded with Structured Silence. There is nothing else like this series out there.

Big ups to the Headspace crew for another successfull bomb-run!

Pirate uploaders to YouTube please note; There is nothing to gain by trying to re-release this title on your own channel, and/or changing the title. It only slows us down and confuses posterity. If you would like to contribute to the project please get in touch and do it like that.

We very much appreciate ALL of you!
