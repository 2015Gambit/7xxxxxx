Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, July 6 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the latest police state antics by the Transportation Security Administration, including testing drinks and an insane policy that will require travelers to "freeze" upon command, a control freak plan once again revealing that the nation's airports have indeed become Gestapo zones where the Fourth Amendment is dead and mean-spirited sadists rule. 

Alex also talks about the latest dismal economic statistics showing that the economy continues to slowly implode as stock markets plunge. 

Alex also talks with Jennifer Collins and Jakari Jackson, the winners of the Infowars Reporter Contest.
