This is a great little film from the late "swinging sixties" of London.  Bogarde apparently regarded it as a "non-event," and it is not perfect (an at times confused mix of comedy, drama, and romance), but it has a great cast, is relatively short, and I always enjoyed it.  It has not been available before, so I thought I would upload it for anyone who, like me, had trouble finding it.  You can purchase a decent all-regions DVD copy on eBay.

This is my first upload.  Hope I did it OK.  Thanks.
