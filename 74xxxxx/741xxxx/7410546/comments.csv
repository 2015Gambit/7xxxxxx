Yes, this is my first torrent up here...so if I did anything wrong while making it or uploading it please do anything you can to assist me.

I have a feeling I may have done something wrong already.  Is it normal for a torrent to have no seeds or leechers on it after it's been uploaded the first time."
[V],azizex666,2012-07-04T03:46Z,it takes an hour or two to update tracker info on piratebay after a torrent gets uploaded so that's normal.
,SolariStar,2012-07-04T04:20Z,@azizex: Thanks. :D
,SolariStar,2012-07-04T04:35Z,Also:  If you like it please seed it...I do not want to be the only one seeding it...along with 3 other people.
