This torrent includes the bonus tracks from ALL versions of Weapons (though I purchased mine from the iTunes store and burned it to a CD then Re-Ripped as MP3 in Media Go).

I give credit to fXpT for the last four tracks.

1) Bring Em Down
2) We Bring an Arsenal
3) Another Shot
4) Jesus Walks
5) A Song for Where I'm From
6) A Little Reminder That I'll Never Forget
7) Better Off Dead
8) Heart On Loan
9) Somedays
10) Can't Get Enough
-----U.S. Bonus Tracks (#12 probably shows up in all versions and #13 & 14 are also in the Japan version)-------
11) Weapons
12) If You Don't Stand For Something, You'll Fall For Anything
13) Undefeated
14) Young Pretenders
15) Bring Em Down (Acoustic)
16) We Bring an Arsenal (Acoustic)
-----UK Bonus Tracks (#20 is also in the Japan version or so I've heard...and seen)------
17) The Dead (Garage Sessions)
18) Save Yourself (Garage Sessions)
19) Another Shot (Demo)
20) Bring Em Down (Russel Bloc Party Remix/Weapons Secret Song)

Because Weapons is a bonus track in the US version and a hidden track that shows up at the end of the Bring Em Down remix it plays twice. (The US version not having the silence before it.)

Sound may be a little inconsistent between the tracks I added and the ones I ripped because I ripped mine at the highest possible bit rate.
