This cool game have been made by Mike Bithell, who is an indie game developer and just like me, makes games for a living.
If you like this game, go to http://www.thomaswasalone.com/ and buy it. It's really cheap, and it's worth it. 
We are indie game developers. we are not companies. By supporting us, you literally invest money into us making more cool games.
Cheers!
