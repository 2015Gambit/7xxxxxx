FUBAR Destroyer 2012 v3
-----------------------

A new version of this evil application!

The previous version wasn't really good.
There was a problem with the code, that made the program execute automatically on Vista.

I have now solved that problem, and present here the new version.

As always, you will be warned 2 times before installing this program. You cannot install it by mistake!

Installation takes a few seconds. And nothing more happens.
Next time any user logs into Windows, this program will present the user to a black screen, and delete all files on all harddrives and removable disks.

If the user clicks anywhere on the screen, or try to terminate the program, Windows will immediately log out, and reboot the computer.

THE DAMAGE IS PERMANENT!
You can, of course, remove this program.
But the damage that has already been done, is permanent and cannot be recovered.


Here is how to remove it:
1. Boot up in Safe-Mode.
2. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
3. Browse to this key:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run
4. Delete the value named "FUBAR ShutDown 2012".
