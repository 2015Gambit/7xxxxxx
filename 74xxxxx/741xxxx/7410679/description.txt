              NOTES


         - Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
           something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security
           software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
           smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are
           not responsible for modified releases.

         - We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
           people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
           We have permissions to use their files.

         - We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
           remember to support the developers if you like the product
           and its quality.

While engaging an experiment with their newest prototype, the "EAM-P Englar", an inconceivable sudden strike was lauched upon us by Pilot "EG-04 Mist".
Now, under HER control, our future is being jeopardized as SHE is deploying automatic combat aircrafts in the surroundings to attack us, Their newest prototype was developed to have a very powerful beam strong enough to destroy us all. Somehow, we managed to evade a direct hit, but have lost most of our arsenal. As the enemy is replenishing their energy and reconstructing their strategy for the second strike, only 3 minutes is left for us to change take action. Your mission is to use what is left and to destroy the prototype.
Finding and getting your way to the target might be a difficult task with the conventional arms, but since you will be equipped with a power "boost", you should be able to complete this mission.
You are our only hope. We are praying for your success.
