With Great Monster Trouble you have to stop the monsters invasion in a world populated by Goblins and Ogres, where the country dwellers gather to defend their houses from a horde of monsters that, wave after wave filter out of various caves.
Full 3D game with animated characters and 360 degree view camera.
You must survive the onslaught to get a chance and move on to the next level.

When it comes to gameplay Great Monster Trouble isnΓÇÖt all conventional, you canΓÇÖt sit down and watch! You must build your defenses using a variety of wooden and brick structures then populate them with a cast of characters ranging from farmers to hunters. When monsters die you have to quickly snatch up the loot they drop before it disappears, and sometime you must take action by dropping some sort of grenade and blow up the little guy or the big boss.

If you think you know everything about strategy, action and defense games then you must try Great Monster Trouble, and even though it may feel familiar you will discover enough small tweaks in the gameplay to make it a worthwhile experience.
