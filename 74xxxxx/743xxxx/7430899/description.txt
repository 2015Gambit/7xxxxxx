A reseed on a seedbox of an old torrent of mine:

Dig the father of modern fingerstyle guitar, John Fahey
   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fahey_(musician)  
 
http://www.johnfahey.com/


This is a collection of his original albums and of live bootlegs too
The bitrate is >= 128kbps... 
All the material comes from extensive search on the web, pretty difficult to find,
even low-fi bootlegs which only give you an insight of the guitar lore of Fahey.

Enjoy... :)
