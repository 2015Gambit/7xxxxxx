 Louise Westerhout delights in cooking for herself, her son, her family and friends, and seeing the results of good and wholesome food, as well as happy mealtimes. For her ΓÇÿcooking, eating and growing in the wonderful culture of foodΓÇÖ is an integral part of the fun of life. This philosophy is reflected in her ideas and recipes for meals for babies upwards of four months, as well as dishes suitable for the whole family. 

 There is an emphasis on organic food and most of the 70-odd recipes are wheat- and sugar-free with many dairy-, egg- and gluten-free options as well. You will find new ideas and healthy combinations, using simple and inexpensive ingredients. The text will appeal to all parents as it encourages without being prescriptive, yet it is simple and practical to eliminate guesswork when it comes to feeding babies and children.
