From Wikipedia:

Spiral Zone was a 1987 American science-fiction animated series produced by Atlantic-Kushner-Locke. Based in part from a toy line made by Japanese company Bandai, the series focused on an international group of soldiers who were fighting to free the world from a scientist who controlled much of the Earth's surface. It only ran for one season, with a total count of 65 episodes.

It took me 4 years to track down all of these episodes, so I figured I'd upload them all on one torrent so others wouldn't have to go through the hassle.
