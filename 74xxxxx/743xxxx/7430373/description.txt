Description:
This blistering little ode to the various tasty treats who populate Porn Valley stars a lineup of little-known but top-drawer triple-X stars. Sandy Reed was the good girl next-door gone bad - a mouth-watering morsel whose all-American good looks masked the heart of a true pervert. She's on fire here when teamed with a helping of good old-fashioned man meat, and scorches her way through scene after scene of absolute decadence and debauchery. Look too for Monica Copeland, a natural-bodied wild-eyed sex machine whose perpetually throbbing libido powers her scenes here. She eats her studly co-stars alive and then begs for more. Then there's Carrie Stevens, one of the most under-rated adult film stars of any era, who shines here in all her characteristic multi-orgasmic glory. A stunning treat for the senses, and an especially good look at these highly impressive but too infrequently seen starlets.
