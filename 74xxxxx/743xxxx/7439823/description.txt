Diamond Divers S01E01-E03 xvid avi -  USA DocuReality Treasure (2012)(like Bering Sea Gold) 

I converted killers mp4s into xvids 640x360p 1000bitrate mp3 128
roughly 350mb episodes.. 

I new series from spiketv.. its a bit of a copy cat show like bering sea gold
and alaska gold rush series so far its not as good but has promise
its a little slow in places and dont seem as exciting as seeing gold :)
but thats just me perhaps
already they have loud music espc when they are still talking which
annoys me also :)

basically a crew and ship is hired by a South african firm to join their
fleet of divers to hoover the bottom of a trench in hope of 
billions of dollars in diamonds and get their cut from the deal

Help to seed if grabbing

enjoy

PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.
