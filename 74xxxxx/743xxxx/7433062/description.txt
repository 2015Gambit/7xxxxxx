Danny Saucedo - Danny Saucedo USA! mp3

Jag är den riktiga Danny


Lyrics:
On my first birthday God played a joke and made me a doppelganger out of snow 
I always thought I’d be the most famous me, but in 2006 you exploded on Swedish TV 

There can only be one, there can only be one 

Jens Lekman personally told me that I should go to Sweden and separate your head from your body 
'Cause then I’ll get your powers, and I’ll get your fan base and I’ll be the King of the Swedish Dance Club Scene 

There can only be one, there can only be one 

Why can’t it be me? 
Maybe this could be the day for Danny Saucedo USA? USA? 

I don’t actually need to be defeating ya’, I just wanna disambiguation link on Wikipedia 
But I’m hot on the porridge to restore my rightful place at the top of our Google results page 

There can only be one, there can only be one 

Pretty much everything I know about Sweden I learned from IKEA and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 
So I assume your sex basement’s really poorly built and that you’ve probably got a few screws loose 

There can only be one, there can only be one 

Why can’t it be me? 
Maybe this could be the day for Danny Saucedo USA! USA! 

Jag är den riktiga Danny 
Och det kan bara finnas en 
Jag är den sanna Danny 
Och det kan bara finnas en 

Why can’t it be me? 
Maybe this could be the day for Danny Saucedo USA! USA!
