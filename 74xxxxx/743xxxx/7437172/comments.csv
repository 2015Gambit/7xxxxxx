It's fairly easy to confirm. Firstly the md5sum of the iso and the setup.exe differ from the other releases.

Microsoft Security Essentials flagged the setup as meredrop (note the setup, not the cracked executable). I decided to proceed anyway and then it flagged another file C:Users\AppDataRoamingRealtekRAVCpl32.exe as Win32/VB.AIX.

Here are the md5's of this one (The one calling piratepedia a piece of shit).
d953b4f48eeac8fba23647baef540ae3  Setup.exe
e117c77c764df0eda0505e99ca082041  sr-endlessspace.iso

Here are the ones from the EtGames one also on TPB:
f2f3bffecf79683a586651ed279aa6c8 Setup.exe
cb21e1538ee4a41e8939a35446ddfe0b  sr-endlessspace.iso

Also neither version work for me, just get a black screen. And both create an incorrectly named shortcut ""Bang Bang Racing"" on the desktop :/ But I haven't looked at the update or for any workarounds yet."

Downloaded and installed SKIDROW 1.09 patch
Launched
??????
Profit - the game works

The only issue is the shortcut being named ""Bang bang racing"", though having proper picture and launching the game as needed.

The other SKIDROW versions have different md5sum's on their isos showing that this one has been tampered with.

I also didn't get the virus alert on the other one (I did get that working eventually too)."
,blackBear2,2012-08-07T19:20Z,"Lol What kind of a virus have you detected ?? Tell me if it has a problem to solve it, because i scan all my torrent with latest version of ESED and have't found anything !?"
