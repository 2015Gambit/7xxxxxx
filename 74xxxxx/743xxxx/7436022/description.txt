Episode 26 : The Dambusters Raid

The dams which supplied Nazi Germany's industrial heartland with power were a vital target for the British, but difficult to attack using conventional weapons. Then in May 1943, nineteen Lancaster bombers took off carrying a revolutionary new "bouncing bomb". Eight of the aircraft were lost on the raid, but two of the dams were successfully breached causing widespread flooding and disruption.
