,BenPrice6,2012-07-11T17:31Z,"Wasn't as brutal as all the hype made it out to be, but damn, that was still pretty fucking brutal. Thanks!"
,wfenriz,2012-07-11T19:03Z,Thanks. 
,captkong,2012-07-12T02:44Z,"Kirkman continues to rehash old plots. 
And what is with these things being so short? There are about half as many pages as other comics have. I don't think I would have been able to get into it at all had I not been able to download the first 70 issues all at once. I look for each new issue with less and less anticipation."
,thadmacracken,2012-07-12T04:28Z,Fn)#en A my man ! Thank eh
,thadmacracken,2012-07-12T04:29Z,Oh and captkong suck my ass dumb shit.
,thadmacracken,2012-07-12T04:30Z,Thank you MM82
,logan-x-art,2012-07-12T05:16Z,"Yea The Walking Dead and Kirkman have jumped the shark...actually they jumped it about 60 issues ago...

I stuck it out just to see where it goes but its really a joke...no new stories or direction...

Killing Glen did it in for me...I stayed because his and Maggies story was the only one that kept me...

Its just a ""rehashing"" of old plots because the writers are too fucking stupid to come up with new material...

Theyve been moving to a ""new better place"" for 60 fucking issues...lame as fuck...

The Walking Dead is now just a big pile of shit with no chance of redemption...

The only way to reboot this series is to start over with a new group of people and new writers...

They should have killed Carl off months ago when he got half his face blown off...

Its really pathetic that this story has consistently gone to shit with every new issue...

Nothing Brutal about this issue, it took 37 fucking pages to kill off Glen...

FUCKING LAME..."
,shonuffx,2012-07-12T06:56Z,Wow! Thanks a lot Mirrormaster82! 
,bizzle603,2012-07-12T07:13Z,"@logan X
dude you might not enjoy the series anymore but that doesn't mean you gotta go and spoil the plot for everyone who aint read it yet. Thanks douche."
,guitarsdj,2012-07-12T21:27Z,"@logan-x-art
Hey, why don't you take the sand out of your vagina and just stop following the comic.  If you're so smart, maybe you should write your own even.  Guess what, TPB isn't FB, so you should keep your comments to thanks/technnical complaints.  You have neither to contribute?  Then get the fuck out of here.  Stop ruining things for other people; people like you ruin the internet just because you're ignorant of what you're doing."
,guitarsdj,2012-07-12T21:28Z,"Btw, Thanks to MirrorMaster82!  ;-)"
,mpa1973,2012-07-12T23:54Z,"Hey dumb asses. Do what I do, don't read the comments until you've read the mag first. I do enjoy the comment though negative and positive the same. thanks for the up mirrormaster82"
,maxmetalero,2012-07-13T00:31Z,666 seeders. Should I be afraid?
,chewiebang,2012-07-13T04:16Z,Shut the fuck up Logan-x-art... OR better yet go write you own best selling comic book so we can download it for free andcomplain about how you jumped the shark by rehashing plot lines. Fucking moron.
,pow.r.pop,2012-07-13T06:19Z,"I will never forget this issue. Thanks mirrormaster.

And I guess it's not a problem to discuss it now that that other dick ruined it.

Anyone else upset that it was Glen? I would have rather it had been Maggi "
,thisclose,2012-07-13T13:08Z,would be awesome if there was a torrent of whole the walking dead 1-100 volumes but thanks a bunch
,harry218,2012-07-13T13:33Z,If you guys don't like this issue don't vote down negative for quality. The quality is perfect as is you bought from Comixology.  
,reesedawkins,2012-07-13T16:01Z,"I knew someone was gonna die was hoping it wasn't one of my favorite characters! It was!! I liked glen, he put himself in a lot dangerous places for the group! He will be missed! "
,reesedawkins,2012-07-13T16:02Z,"Thanks MM, you are the man!!!"
,barr91,2012-07-14T02:59Z,"Was not expecting this. Not sure if I will keep reading after the events of this issue.

I hope zombies come back soon. I like the whole people are the danger now (and always were), but Walking Dead was always about the zombies first. "
,m3tatr0n,2012-07-14T12:15Z,"thanks! 
i actually bought a few copies of this as i collect and wanted to keep them mint so i read this on my tablet. do that alot.

dude was one of my favorite characters so yea it sucks but that's not gonna make me stop reading a comic i have followed for a few years over 100 issues..
its not the first time they have killed off a main character, its just that the remaining main characters are getting smaller in number... it should be expected.. if you read anything else kirkman writes like invincible for instance, you should know he likes to do shit like this and make it brutal..
almost like he likes for the reader to be pissed at him, but i don't think its a bad thing, keeps it interesting.. from the start this comic has been alot about characterization and dialogue if it was just a straight up zombie book it would suck and wouldnt do as well as it has..
can tell some of you haven't read it for very long or just went through all of them recently..

wtf @ most comics being longer than this.... no...they are not.. unless you are counting ads and mini-series spots in the back..lol..

and as for back to the zombies? why ...zombies can't talk.. all they can do is show artwork of them killing the motherfuckers..

there hasn't been alot of zombies lately because they have established themselves in a safehold..between their community the hilltop and the saviors group most the zombies in the area have been killed..."
,captkong,2012-07-15T05:02Z,"Yep. I counted. Picked up an old copy of SSOC I have sitting right here. Damn near 2x as many pages to the story, not even counting the bonus mini-story at the end, and the half dozen pages of bonus artwork included. Better art, too. Maybe they just don't make comics like they used to. I'm going to finish this little story arc. But I'm not getting my hopes up. This thing is going downhill, and if it bothers any of you pussies to hear that - eat a dick."
,kornspell,2012-07-15T15:21Z,Thank you!
,cptforge_gil,2012-07-17T00:51Z,"@ logan x?
I get it now, those who either got no decent job or got nothing going on their lives talk real loud.
Even spoiling things for the rest who got things going on their lives
If u got something to say about the story, then make your own comics
Call it ""The talking troll""
Cos it seems its your specialty
Dont get me wrong man, my job deals with guarding the nations door from the barbarian horde that are around us and from time to time I love to loose myself in this mr.kirkmans stories
so hang back man. Mind your own business. Be a professor or a surgeon. U seem a smart person. So stop spoiling shit for the rest of us"
,Z0001,2012-07-18T17:54Z,"Mirrormaster82, Thank you for the upload.

As for the most of the people in the comments section- learn some decency and use something like *Spoiler Alert* before discussing which character dies. Thanks a fucking lot for killing the plot for me. And yes, I did have to read the comments. To make sure the text wasn't in Spanish."
,Yosho2k,2012-07-22T07:32Z,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. FUCK YOU ROBERT KIRKMAN.
,Yosho2k,2012-07-22T07:33Z,"Also, all you bitches. Shit or get off the pot, quit reading or stop your bitching. 

Especially you logan you spoiler bitch. That baseball bat belongs up your ass."
,adidlucu,2012-07-23T13:45Z,thanks dude! :)
,batotit2008,2012-07-25T19:04Z,f*ck glenn. what I wanna know is when the mullet guy will get some action with that hot chic. YEEHAA!!
,ufalum88,2012-07-30T03:39Z,"The loud mouth is right.  This was a great read, but it has become the same old story over and over.  The group finds a new spot to hold up, the group is safe, the group drops their guard, the group meets a new bad guy and the group manages to overcome.  Oh, and along the way, we will kill a main character to show we are not afraid to be daring.  Yawn.  Something needs to happen outside the pattern.  Either find a cure that is near impossible to obtain, find a way to kill off a lot of the walkers, or make the disease more aggressive so that you do not have to die to be overcome...SOMETHING DIFFERENT, PLEASE!  Otherwise, you'll just lose readers."
,stijr,2012-07-31T18:57Z,AWESOME!!!
,HI_Sa1nt,2012-08-03T10:22Z,"No need to give it a -1 because Glenn dies... I agree with ufalum88, same thing over and over."
,dionisio88,2012-08-11T01:54Z,"gracias

,SumHiDOOD,2012-09-04T03:06Z,"hey you think your going to put up the new ones, past 100?
