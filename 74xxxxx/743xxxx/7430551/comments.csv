,deltaop007,2012-07-20T05:38Z,"@Rummy, the torrent is working fine but it will do with a few more seeders. Great quality for the size though! Cheers!"
,deltaop007,2012-07-20T15:20Z,Seeeeed please! Stuck at 64.5 for HOURS!
,deltaop007,2012-07-20T18:52Z,A lot of leechers a stuck between 63 & 65%. I think there is a problem with this torrent.
,deltaop007,2012-07-20T18:54Z,"Update: Nearly all of the leechers are NOT going beyond 64.5%, including me."
