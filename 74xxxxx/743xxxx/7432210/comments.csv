Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 10 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,wiredcitroen,2012-07-12T10:49Z,"Babybluetits24  ~ you have some good ideas but let me help you somewhat. A friend of mine worded up a GREEN PIRATE ICON who later went to a BLUE ( that should tell you WHO it is/was ) re the same issues you bring forth and was THROWN OFF TPB because that sook didn't like the TRUTH, and so ran to the MODS and complained, so BE CAREFUL just WHAT and WHO you criticize, and it doesn't have to be Racial, swearing, or even funny, Mr **** bitches BIG TIME ~ Needs to get a life, sitting and uploading all day everyday IS NOT A JOB. And sadly TvTeam and Scenebalance NEVER give details re their uploads. They are busy being Pirates too :) SAID WITH ALL DUE RESPECT"
