The Rescue Bots and the Burns family investigate a meteor that has
landed on Wayward Island. Bumblebee arrives and joins in the mission.
When the particle components emanated by the meteor immobilize
the Autobots and render them mute, the Burns family
must create an antidote that reverses the effects.
