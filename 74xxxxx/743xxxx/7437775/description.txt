The Naked Truth [1957]

Nigel Dennis publishes a scandal magazine. But for each story he writes, he
firstapproaches the person whose scandalous behavior is described (or rather
implied, to avoid any libel suit) and says he will suppress the story in return
for money. Several of his victims first decide individually to kill him instead
of paying, but fail in amusing ways. Then they find that to protect their
various secrets they must now join forces for a rather different purpose...
