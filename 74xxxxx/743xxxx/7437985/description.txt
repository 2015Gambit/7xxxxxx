
In Barcelona the meet and fall in love and HÃ©ctor Nerea from Madrid ... the Phaedra and Hippolytus from Athens. Had to be found in Barcelona, miles away from their homeland to join. In the city where lost souls meet. Like Talia from Andalusia, the Apolo from Venezuela, Ariadna from Greece, an unknown from France, a singer from who knows where ... Two love stories photographed the two strongest points, beginning and end, not necessarily in that order. Pass by the loss of passion, of sorrow to happiness, from pain to joy, from the zenith to nadir. Since the riots, in other words, our course as people looking to find what you are made of dreams. That is the same.
