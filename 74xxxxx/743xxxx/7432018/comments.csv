Thank you for continually uploading Metalocalypse in .avi format.  I cannot find a copy of S04E11 in .avi and I was hoping you might be able to help me out.  Every time to I try to transcode it from mp4 it looks and sounds terrible, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I would greatly appreciate E11 and E12 (when it comes out) if you can find the time in your busy pirate day.  Yaaaaarrrrgh."
