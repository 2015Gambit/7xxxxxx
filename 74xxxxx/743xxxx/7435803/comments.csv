You list all UFC on Fuel, FX, Fox, and Versus as UFC on FX so it is kind of hard to pick out what is what. It helps that you put who fought who, so at least it can be looked up. Anyway not complaining(too much) Thanks a lot."
,adam28co,2012-07-30T08:26Z,is the single fight of weidman vs munoz available and if not could you make that happen the other fights were kind of bunk
