Gold Version Features:
=======================
Multiple Media Collections:
----------------------------
'Collections' allow large media libraries to be segmented, customized and managed independently. For example Classical Music, Jazz, Kids Music, Home videos, TV, etc. can each configured with custom views and playback rules. For example, a Classical Music collection can be configured to display a Conductor node and an Original Year column, and play with cross-fading disabled, whereas Contemporary Music wouldn't.
MediaMonkey gives you all the tools you need to manage large music / movie collections.

Organize Files Automatically:
------------------------------
Automatically organize and rename audio / video files on your hard drive into a logical hierarchy of your choice according to a set of rules that you define. Classical music can be organized by Composer and Home Videos by Date and MediaMonkey will take care of organizing them automatically as a background process.

Advanced AutoPlaylists:
------------------------
Create advanced AutoPlaylists which automatically generate a music mix to suit your mood. Just define practically any set of criteria and the mix is automatically created.
Synchronize Advanced Playlist with Portable Devices, giving you the perfect tool for rapidly downloading a subset of your collection to your device. For example, you can choose to sync a random subset totalling 256 MB of music that match a defined set of criteria.
For the average user, creating a music mix and synching it couldn't be easier.

Auto-Conversion and Leveling:
------------------------------
Auto-conversion allows you to automatically sync, share (over DLNA) or burn tracks, converting tracks on-the-fly to a format that is supported by your iPod/iPhone or other portable device or CD/DVD/DLNA player, while retaining all metadata.
Auto-conversion can also convert tracks to lower bitrates to make more effective use of the limited storage capacity on a portable device. This is especially useful for lossless music collections, which can't fit on a portable device.
In addition, Auto-leveling levels track volume on-the-fly so that tracks play at a steady volume on CDs/DVDs and on devices that don't support volume leveling (i.e. most devices besides iPods).

Professional-quality CD Ripping:
---------------------------------
Secure Ripping detects when a CD has been damaged and throttles the disc's rotation until it is sufficiently slow to deliver identical reads on at least 2 occasions. Once a disc has been ripped, MediaMonkey can validate that it was bit-perfect by comparing the resultant data to that of the AccurateRip database.
MediaMonkey delivers professional quality ripping in consumer-friendly software.
