Snakes- Ecology and Conservation(EPUB+PDF+MOBI)[Team Nanban]tmrg

Comstock Publishing Associates | 2009 | ISBN: 0801445655 | English | 384 pages | EPUB+PDF+MOBI | 1.5 MB+ 6.55 MB+ 2.8 MB

DESCRIPTION:

Destruction of habitat due to urban sprawl, pollution, and deforestation has caused population declines or even extinction of many of the world's approximately 2,600 snake species. Furthermore, misconceptions about snakes have made them among the most persecuted of all animals, 
despite the fact that less than a quarter of all species are venomous and most species are beneficial because they control rodent pests. It has become increasingly urgent, therefore, to develop viable conservation strategies for snakes and to investigate their importance as monitors of ecosystem health and indicators of habitat sustainability.
