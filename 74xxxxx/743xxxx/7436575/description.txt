Hemplands Conspiracy

Hemp is one of the most useful crops in the history of history of history! It used to be legal, but not any longer. Anyone who wants to make a product from hemp like a hemp handbag ,a hemp dog collar, hemp baby clothes, hemp rope, hemp shoes,  or anything has to import their hemp from another country. George Washington was a hemp farmer and has been a major part of many countries economic systems. In fact the US Constitution was written on Hemp!
Hemp seeds can be eaten raw, ground into a meal, sprouted, made into milk (akin to soy milk), prepared as tea and used in baking. The fresh leaves can also be consumed in salads. Products include cereals, frozen waffles, hemp tofu, and nut butters. A few companies produce value added hemp seed items that include the seed oils, whole hemp grain (which is sterilized by law in the United States, where they import it from China and Canada), dehulled hemp seed (the whole seed without the mineral rich outer shell), hemp flour, hemp cake (a by-product of pressing the seed for oil) and hemp protein powder. Hemp is also used in some organic cereals, for non-dairy milk[20] somewhat similar to soy and nut milks, and for non-dairy hemp ΓÇ£ice cream.ΓÇ¥
