Episode 24 : German Commerce Raiders

During World War I, the German navy enjoyed considerable success with commerce raiders disguised as merchantmen. When World War 2 began, it was decided to use similar tactics, and nine disguised raiders were sent out alongside Germany's small number of major warships to prey on enemy shipping. All were eventually hunted down, but not until almost 200 Allied ships had been sunk.
