Sanjay wanted to study art, but his domineering 
father, an engine driver in retirement after    
a crippling injury, insisted that a railway job,
with its security, was the best thing for him.  
So Sanjay ended up as a train conductor,        
unhappy with the career forced upon him,        
and the mechanical, meaningless life that       
he lives. In the course of his duty on the      
train, he runs into a working girl, Shalini     
and feels attracted to her. His father hears    
about his interest in Shalini, strongly         
disapproves of it and intervenes in Sanjay's    
life once again. Unable to stand up to his      
father, Sanjay soon finds himself married to    
a village girl. Life becomes even more          
unbearable for Sanjay. He takes to wandering    
and seeks comfort in drink and brothels.        
One final chance comes his way to break loose   
from his shackles and plan a new life           
with Shalini. Will he let it pass...
