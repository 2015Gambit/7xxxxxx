,Buht,2012-07-12T04:32Z,"A/V  7/5. Not the best video, dark and goes in and out of focus, but it's watchable."
,RavenOfNevermore,2012-07-12T07:03Z,"Most of the versions of this are going to be cams, and will fade in and out from time to time.

It was an awesome movie, saw it on the Midnight showing.

Back to the basic story line from the comics.

Just like they did with batman."
,aquanovix,2012-07-12T07:19Z,"total crap, audio sucks just like all the others"
,-EliT3-,2012-07-12T21:27Z,@aquanovix the audio is actually much better than any cam out there. this is the best available right now.

6/7"

v-7 a-7 of 10  good for a cam/ts.
does go out of sync now and then, but not bad.
had to lighten it up a few clicks in gom player. "
,special_ed_420,2012-07-15T21:39Z,hows the audio? all the other ones effing suck
,special_ed_420,2012-07-15T21:42Z,is it cinavia protected? can't get some of these to play on my ps3
,Jack_b8,2012-07-16T04:19Z,"For a CAM
A- 7
V- 6

HOWEVER - there are chunks of the film missing.
It's a copy that will give you a good idea of the film, but is not the whole film by several minutes."
,Jack_b8,2012-07-16T04:22Z,"BTW - I give the movie itself a 5
#1 - It's all been done before
#2 - the re-write of certain elements is unnecessary

Inside info: Sony had to put something, anything out, in the Spidey franchise or it would revert back to Marvel comics.  The lack of quality and ""just throw something out there"" shows."

,LovelessUchiha,2012-07-21T19:36Z,"Several scenes in the movie are cutout. What the fuck! Quality is watchable and sound is pretty decent, but why bother posting if scenes are missing, makes it hard to follow when essential shit is missing."

,captainmouadh,2012-07-23T08:08Z,Not the worst torrent... at least you get to watch a free movie... unthankful losers.
,Ryan0306,2012-07-24T01:04Z,Starts off perfect then skips scenes like crazy. It skips almost a total of 15 minutes of the movie throughout.

,STEFTZZZ,2012-07-29T10:59Z,"GREAT quality for a cam. How come the other cams on your account aren't always as good as this one?
Thanks a lot"
,legio9,2012-07-30T19:45Z,"Love the way people comment """"good for a cam"" , I wonder if they rate their lunch compared to dog shit too?

This is an EXCELLENT, FANTASTIC version compared to cavemen drawing on walls done with rocks.

No matter the ""source"", the END RESULT compared to something ""watchable"" of decent quality:  is a complete waste of bandwidth, an INSULT to technology and is thus rated by this unique neutral standard:

ALL versions as of this date (July 30th)

V: 4
A: 3 

Quality will get you respect and fame....speed of release absolutely nothing."
,tymanbrew,2012-07-31T00:29Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. not only is it shitty quality it contains a trace, Just got a cease and desist email from my isp. FML"
,a40ozToFreedom3,2012-07-31T04:24Z,"MISSING PARTS. I would not recommend it for that reason. Big chunks of some good scenes. Other than that the quality is not bad. everyone who is complaining about the quality are jaded spoiled brats. Its very watchable. If they hate cams then why are they even on this page? Bottom line, very watchable, but missing parts"
,Zeke714,2012-08-01T04:59Z,"This torrent, in my opinion, is the best ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movie that is currently available for download as of today.

The best subtitles I have found for this torrent are located here:

,AbDevils,2012-08-15T17:07Z,"@ Leigo9....its quiet bizarre dat u made a comparison of lunch wit dog shit, Honestly,frm ur wrds i think u eat dog shit as ur lunch....No offence bro, Its a simple rule here...TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.....
If u didnt like this then don't download it....If u consider ur bandwidth to be so precious, use ur money & watch it @ the theaters or else buy a DVD wen it releases.....
The guy who uploaded this has done a noble task by saving many people their money....He has taken a life's risk by recordin this and goin against the law....I can't imagine evn the most craziest child dreamin of u takin that risk anyday....
Knw one thng bro....

Its easy 2 sit in the gallery and shout at d players for givin out a bad game.....But only wen u r out there on the field, do u realize d Herculian nature of the task ur givn....

A million thnxx to d uploader..."
,legio9,2012-08-16T03:24Z,"AbDevils..first learn to write English..yeah , I know : am asking a lot of you to use ANY cognitive abilities...but heck..am the type who push people to become better...

I do not have ""take it or leave it""....No one has to in this community. The GOAL of ALL of this is to bypass the robbery theaters and Hollywood does, the exploitation of the people, That's one of the reasons FILE SHARING was created for... not for little idiots  like yourself to have some form of identity or to POLLUTE the web with CRAP.
Thanks to people of my generation and the ones who share this philosophy does this form of sharing still exist, by the QUALITY we put in, by the PRIDE in our work we do and in the OPPORTUNITY to sharpen our skills.

BY a SIMPLE STANDARD OF QUALITY and not by some pathetic or egomaniac thinks he does is great

You, you just promote MEDIOCRITY,  probably to make you look better in some ways....

Now, IF someday you have a girlfriend, don't be surprised if she leave or cheat on you..cause she will be looking for someone who does the job RIGHT and not one who simply is happy with mediocrity.

Maybe at that time will you understand the value of thriving to become (in your case) much much much better.

NOW for all the ignorant who does not seams to even know how the rating REALLY works so that the ENTIRE community have a STANDARD of referal:

V: 10 = Blueray quality
V:  9 = Perfect DVD quality
V:  8 = Perfect  other format quality
V:  7 = Perfect cam quality
V:  6 = Very good quality (no matter format)
V:  5 = OK Quality (no matter format)
V   4 = Poor but watchable Quality
V   3 = Very Poor Quality (no matter format)

V 1-2 =  simply do not download: crap."

,AbDevils,2012-08-17T01:52Z,"@ Leigo9, so now u hide under d cloak of a saintly hermit who tries to shine his philosophies hoping to gain the respect & admiration of d few anemic children.....
 Promotion of Mediocrity....Well at least I'm promoting something!!!.....

U speak of a robbery committed by the people who created & manage the distribution of this movie.....Well, would it be possible to watch this film if Hollywood had not made it.....Moreover a movie of this kind which utilizes almost every bells & jingles forged by modern technology, undoubtedly requires a heavy capital amount 4 concoction....So please tell me whether it would be a surprise to find the theater authorities charging a good lot 4 d tickets.....

From the descriptions provided here & from the the use a facile cerebral ability termed as common sense(one which u may not posses), its clear that this is a camera-recorded version uploaded for those who find it inconvenient to watch this celluloid at the theaters.......

The A/V ratings u presented r clearly meaningless for this and cannot be employed in this context.....Its certainly a cam .....but that doesn't mean that its not a work which deserves not much, but some gratitude......

For a movie which is still running at the theaters this is d best thing we've got....

Its a common statement to hear,'Crap, Do not download it'....Well the people must understand that the uploaded file  is a CAM and evidently its not gonna be as good as watching the movie in the theaters nor will it be better than a DVD version....Surely there will be many unclear, vague, blurred & unviewable parts in the movie and this will never be useful 4 guy wishes to receive a majestic movie-watching experience....

But it is worth for many others who just aspire to have knowledge of its story line or get a rough idea about a newly-released film...."

Not only have you been arguing about an absolutely idiotic approach to file-sharing and a completely moronic reluctance to the ""take it or leave it"", you have been doing all this in surprisingly bad English while at the same time telling AbDevils to write correct English. Man you should really go pray to God for some form of intelligence before you write comments on public forums :)"
,Dufox,2012-08-25T19:12Z,"@legio9

that entire paragraph is absolute bull shit.

file sharing was made for, get this... sharing files.
this CLEARLY says TS in the name. 
then in the description it has exact details of what this is.

so in the end, your raging at someone for sharing a file that is properly named and detailed. then your raging at people rating a cam with cam standards...


the average person should be able to understand the difference of V:9 on a cam torrent and a V:9 dvdrip.

the word ignorant implys others dont know the way things work... instead of making your own special system you should learn what others are doing...

the universal quality standards are

10- flawless (this is a 9 to people who understand that nothing is perfect)
8-9- download this, its standard quality..
1-7- check the sample, chances are you can find better, if not you can soon.

if it says cam in the description stop and think before you make yourself sound like an immature piece of shit.


for the record i literally LOL'd when i read ur comment."

,beergirl2,2012-09-01T21:28Z,"@turabaq-I thought the exact same thing regarding LEGIO9's comments.

Now its quite possible that you have an alt, but when I clicked on your name I noticed you have never uploaded ANYTHING. If your going to complain about someone elses work, maybe we should be able to compare to your many feats of success.
