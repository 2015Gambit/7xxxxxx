On request from fellow members .............
(iso 888mb) after (installation size 2.5gb)
as name suggest there r no metro application
it doesn't mean it becomes win 7 there r lots of other features present in win 8
this iso is for ppl who hate metro and  want to try win 8 on small drive ~2.5gb
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
os build from original Windows 8 Release Preview 32-bit
u will not need key as i slip-streamed it (Product Key = TK8TP9JN6P7X7WWRFFTVB7QPF)
Unattended - just give drive to install 3 gb is sufficient
os will install in 15-20 min as compare to full original os takes 45min-1hr
