,extracube,2012-07-14T11:34Z,"Nile, have been enjoying looking through all of your torrents, keep them up man!

However, I personally am hoping to see what this new ""metro"" desktop tile system is like.  Will have to wait for another one."
,nileshtambe,2012-07-14T12:39Z,"@extracube
thanks a lot
I think  u misunderstood , u can use metro in this , i have only deleted metro applications (630mb)
not the metro,u can download n use any metro application  from Microsoft store like Google play Nokia store , i have removed metro APPLICATIONS not the METRO.....

in simple world metro is windows gadgets placed in square tiles ,70% ppl hate who use desktop ,
hope Microsoft bring back start menu in final RTM which is i think going to release in Oct "

,nileshtambe,2012-07-19T11:45Z,"@jeet
I also cant play games on this because my ati beta driver for win8 doesn't get installed.

about .net   4 is present and i have not activated 3.5 in install wim before slimming so it might broke,
as 3.5 is present in win8 in unactivated state we have to activate in Programs n Feature .
but due to slimming and reducing winsxs that feature doesn't work.

my advice to u is please use win 7 for gaming 
and treat win 8 as beta only"

,zailer,2012-07-22T18:47Z,"sure will check that out...
ok question time :)

i figured out what you were telling by ""capture wim""
ok i press apply (after removing comp,add drivers,tweaks un attend ) then can i close vlite and reboot then use win tool kit to mount install.wim and capture it with max compression ?

my vlite install is 1.8gig and 6.9gig with mounted :(  [all this for a 80gb SSD on a tablet pc ] hehe ..

i dont have WAIK installed yet. mostly will get it tonight but wondering if its really needed for this .. meanwhile gonna check ur videos :) thanks a lot nil ."
,nileshtambe,2012-07-22T19:21Z,"1.Extract iso 
2.use win tool kit and enable .net on install wim
3.use gimagex and apply install wim
4.capture applied install wim
this apply and capture on install wim is done for making it compitible with vlite
as vlite will not work on sp1 iso and win contains sp1 already
5.now ur install.wim is compitible with vlite
6.so open ur iso now in vlite  and do whatever u want to do with it 

if u dont do in this order u will   get error ,
good luck ,n happy slimming !!!!!!"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-22T19:23Z,"WAIK is not needed if u have portable vlite with wim filtre

,b_addy,2012-07-31T08:08Z,"Altough nil did a very good job with this, I stil can't stand this shit. It's crap compared to 7. But that's just my opinion."
,nileshtambe,2012-07-31T15:38Z,"@b_addy
i agree with u, win 8 is crappy shit compare to 7, as every alternative os of ms failed , hope win 9 will be better, ms will experiment with us like vista,
as they already started with removing start menu,they can include both metro  n normal start menu but deliberately  removed it to experiment with us..."
