Sound: Music and sound seem to block each other. The music stops as soon as the first sound is to be heard.

I match the system requierments. What could be the problem? I already tried to switch resolution. Doesn't work. Help, please!"
,jesusshockwave,2012-09-17T10:37Z,@Frrrritz What system do you have? Perhaps someone here can help diagnose. Post any other info that may help solve the problem. I am sorry it didn't work for you. 
,jesusshockwave,2012-09-17T10:39Z,I know Mac OS Lion has a ton of problems with it. I personally have 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). It works for me.
