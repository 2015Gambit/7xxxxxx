,Oblivilot,2012-07-12T03:55Z,"""Perhaps lost in all the controversy over the film is the fact that James Baskett, a black man, was the very first live actor ever hired by Disney.""

He died at a relatively early age, only 44 years old.

,Oblivilot,2012-07-12T03:56Z,"""Baskett was unable to attend the film's premiere in Atlanta, Georgia because he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities in what was then a city racially segregated by law. On March 20, 1948, Baskett received an Honorary Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus. He was the first black man to win an Academy Award."""

""Controversy and Legacy: The animal stories were conveyed in such a manner that they were not seen as ostensibly racist by many among the audiences of the time. By the mid-20th century, however, the dialect and the ""old Uncle"" stereotype of the narrator, was considered politically incorrect and demeaning by many African-American people, on account of what they considered to be racist and patronizing attitudes toward African-Americans. Providing additional controversy is the story's context in the Antebellum south on a slave owning plantation, a setting that is portrayed in a passive and even docile manner. Nevertheless, Harris' work was, according to himself, an accurate account of the stories he heard from the slaves when he worked on a plantation as a young man. He claimed to have listened to, and memorized, the African American animal stories told by Uncle George Terrell, Old Harbert, and Aunt Crissy at the plantation; he wrote them down some years later. He acknowledged his debt to these storytellers in his fictionalized autobiography, 'On the Plantation' (1892). Many of the stories that he recorded have direct equivalents in the African oral tradition, and it is thanks to Harris that their African-American form is preserved."""
