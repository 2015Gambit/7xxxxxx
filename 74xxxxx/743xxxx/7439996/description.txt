American Weed
All-new series American Weed finds Colorado medical marijuana businesses under scrutiny and facing mounting pressures from local residents. Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fund-raisers. As the oldest of 11 kids, Josh relies heavily on several of his brothers to work at the grove and keep his business supplied in medical marijuana. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the ten-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado?
Episode 5: Pot Or Not?
After a tooth-and-nail campaign to determine the fate of retail pot in Fort Collins, the day of reckoning has finally come. Pro-ban activists Scoot Crandall and Ray Martinez make a last-minute push to get voters to the polls, while the Stanley brothers and patient Susan Smeltzer fight back. Dispensary managers Dawn and John Clifford continue to help patients, hoping that their livelihood won't go up in smoke.
