,EmcaDrone,2012-07-12T23:36Z,:D
,surfishak,2012-07-12T23:45Z,"Podem Baixar sem medo, melhor qualiadde encontrada na internet até agora Audio 9 / video 9."
,surfishak,2012-07-12T23:49Z,"Better quality found so far on the Internet, audio and video 9, no virus."
,DLthemALL,2012-07-13T02:21Z,seed!
,umairey,2012-07-13T11:36Z,this is what? lol
,deepblue2000,2012-07-13T22:07Z,"Cant believe how stupid many people are.

There is no new source. It is still the version (source) that was release in may !!!"
,saim15,2012-07-14T11:08Z,"damn it 
it is also camera"
,MidnightRob,2012-07-14T11:12Z,"Who the hell would rate this a 9 on any scale. Same that has been floating around, not worth the time considering how long the movie has been out. Nice effort..................  but just seems to be an old upload. "
,kakis06,2012-07-15T20:22Z,great quality for cam v9 a8
,pokefreaken,2012-07-15T23:28Z,surfishak it doesn't help posting comments with good A/V ratings on your own fake shit. people can see your name in the top of the side you dumb fuck!!!
,Ju2theTru,2012-07-16T02:05Z,"yo, saim15. The movie is still in theatres. Of Course this video is done by camera. why wouldn't it? are you stupid?/////////////

anywho, finally saw this in theatres last week, better than I thought it would be, now to rewatch my fav scenes. thanx for the upload 
"
,epimansg,2012-07-16T03:03Z,Amazing how many people make comments I mean cry and complain on movies being cams when the vids are still in theater as Ju2theTru just mentioned how the heck could it be anything else unless someone in the movie business really didn't like their job....instead of complaining appreciate the work the uploaders put into it for you or don't waist your time looking at them and our time having to listen to you're kindergarten childish bleeping....
,MidnightRob,2012-07-16T08:47Z,"^What the fuck did you just say? Was a total mess and lack comprehension. It isn't the fact that this is a camp and people are complaining, it's the fact that this is the same exact copy that was uploaded months ago. It is no better/worse  than the other, so why reupload it under a new name? Also, just because  a movie is in theaters doesn't mean a viable copy wouldn't be available for viewing. There have been many many movies that were released here in decent quality way before the movie would hit dvd.  Seems like the quality since the old days has really gone downhill. "
,FLAX_ceed,2012-07-17T01:52Z,"Totally agree with MidnightRob. I've downloaded qite a few 10/10 quality copies when they were still in theaters, but this whole thing about passing off this fake ass garbage as the real deal gets on peoples nerves. Either say what it is and don't take credit for someone elses shit, or get the fuck out of here"
,surfishak,2012-07-18T20:54Z,"Se o Audio o Video Não tão com qualidade bõa  do tipo bluray e só não baixar, todo mundo sabe que esse filmes ainda não foi lançado em dvd ou bluray, ninguém e obrigado a baixar, algumas pessoas pessam que quem faz o upload ganham um rio de dinheiro, só tenho a dizer a quem ta criticando e que procurem fazer melho!!!"
,surfishak,2012-07-18T20:54Z,"If the Audio Video quality not so good like bluray and just did not fall, everyone knows that this film has not yet been released on dvd or bluray, and thank anyone to download, some people pessam whoever uploads earn a river of money, just have to say to whom ta criticizing and seeking to improve!"
,KinggFear,2012-07-19T03:11Z,you think the video is 9??? are your blind people?? video is no better than 6 1/2 or 7 and audio is tollerable at about a 7.5. ill wait for a better copy. i cant deal with the horrible contrast on these cam uploads. thanks to the uploader anyway
,thakurz,2012-07-20T12:12Z,"i shall be thankful to those persons who spend there precious time to comment on the torrents....   rather its fake or hit..... coz your comments explain more than the descriptions...
really thankyou guyz ..  :) "
,KalEl2080,2012-07-23T19:42Z,"You'd be surprised at how many people would settle for less and would see a V-5 A-5 and rate it 9 or 10. The rating of course is based on the excitement of actually seeing the film. Standards are extremely low these days. Bootleggers are actually satisfied with the garbage they sell and many are content with said garbage.

I download the films I want to see a month before or on the month of their release to ensure that I get a perfect HD (Blu Ray) copy to play on my PS3."
,bmlc,2012-07-23T21:02Z,Prefiro esperar pela release Blueray ou HD-DVD.
,senhamat,2012-07-24T18:56Z,Any screenshots??
,rcr29budcar,2012-07-26T00:45Z,"KalEl,
 If your getting bluray quality downloads the month of or before they are released, how bout uploading them for everyone else to enjoy?  Not being a smart ass, but if u can do that, it would certainly justify you bashing the uploaders here and at the same time make you a hero to allot of the downloaders here.  Not tryin to be a smart ass, just sayin."
,rcr29budcar,2012-07-26T06:54Z,"Why in God's name would anyone put a/v at 9!?  This is not a new source! Its a very decent copy, but its the exact same one as most of the others! What the fuck is wrong with some people!?  Really!? Its almost like the uploader was able to put comments up under other names!? Hmmm!? Coincidence!?  Probably not!"
,mfarouk,2012-07-26T17:12Z,Thank you uploader
,TheMiitry,2012-07-30T16:14Z,A-9 V-9???  not really   .!. 
,sconya67,2012-08-01T18:33Z,A:7  V:7  nice job uploader
,haynezy,2012-08-05T01:56Z,"Does anyone know when the actual dvd rip would be out,since its been a while now!!!"
,whoistherabbit,2012-08-05T22:42Z,"everyone knows cams suck. people who cry about this one are retarded, this is great for cam.  thanks!"
,MMusic123,2012-08-07T13:39Z,"The Avengers  will be released at retail  Sep 25,2012.   So at this point...just wait, because the DVD should be leaked a week or so early (most are)  and it will be a much nicer copy to keep."
,RWS24,2012-08-09T14:01Z,"The Avengers is being released in Australia on August 29, which is the earliest I've seen on anywhere else, so expect a leak around then."
,senssuiy,2012-08-16T01:22Z,"Valeu brother...

abrigado ....manow..."
