Bossa Nova - The Sound That Seduced The World

Arts Documentary hosted by Greg Appel, published by ABC in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Built on layers of samba rhythms, classical and jazz guitar and poetic lyricism, the sultry Bossa Nova sound was spawned in the beaches and bars of Rio, Brazil in the late 50s, and soon dominated the world's clubs and lounge rooms when anthems like "The Girl from Ipanema" became huge international hits. These seductive songs of love by the ocean are celebrated in this compelling documentary - first aired on ABC TV and filmed on location around Rio - that features interviews with giants of the genre including Marcos Valle, Carlos Lyra and Sergio Mendes, whose Brazil '66 (and the song "Mas Que Nada") took the Bossa beat to new heights in the late 60s and 70s. Rare live clips of Bossa pioneers Joao and Astrud Gilberto revive the beauty, depth and timeless legacy of the sound that seduced the world.
