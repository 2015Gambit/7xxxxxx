and anyone under the age of 30.. who
cant handle a bit of fuss on their recordings

one can always tell when someone didnt grow up with b & w tv and rabbit ears alone VHS tapes :) 

those people are better to wait a few days for other cappers to come out with something..


shit even a & e tv can even provide a min of 600 bitrate video to its own tv site online 
but prob done on purpose to prevent people wanting to rip it to p2p no doubt ::)"
,q2323,2012-07-13T12:00Z,"psspss: can you please make a rips of dangerous flights episodes 5 to 8 ? its already available on dangerouflights.ca as a full episodes, but nobody made a rip for non-us watchers. its discovery channel canada, but I hope it'll work also in US.  thanks a lot man"
,q2323,2012-07-13T12:14Z,I hate canada now
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T12:44Z,"opps I mean a &e cant even not can..

and for flights .. not really. I dont watch it 
I only share stuff I watch or may watch
but since my isp data cap is reduce I have to becareful where I waste it.. since its not free after all

why do you rip it.. get a vpn with ca access..
and tubedigger it and convert to xvid etc"
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T12:45Z,"some ca streaming bitrates are terrible also..

some of the modern shows they now doing 600 instead of 400 but still depends on the show"
,q2323,2012-07-13T13:05Z,"alright, I understand.. I live in czech republic, we have no data caps here. I tried several canadian proxies but no success. thanks anyway. and thanks for barter kings E08. quality is not that bad, it's definitely watchable"
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T13:41Z,"sadly even my ca proxy is crawling at 10kb/s

not sure if its overloaded but at this rate to get one episode of something Im trying to get its going to take a day..

you might need a elite proxy.. try proxyswitcher pro but you best bet is a vpn.. some cost like $5 a month which is affordable and you get liek 14 other country ips with it"
