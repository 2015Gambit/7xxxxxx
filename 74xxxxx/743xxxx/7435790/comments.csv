,mattm2047,2012-07-12T13:20Z,"Horrible torrent. Picture is blurred, staticy, and cuts in and out. Wait for better copy. Really isnt watchable..."
,Legokun,2012-07-12T20:22Z,"To the ignorant guys out there: These are the preliminary fights ripped from the live facebook broadcast. There is no possible way to get better quality for these fights (At least not that I know of). If you watched it LIVE, the quality would be just as bad. Now stop complaining and appreciate the work other people do for YOU.


Thanks for the up scene4all! "

But this is a web rip not much you can do with Facebook crap I am just happy to get it wish it was better but oh well your still the KING in my mind. Hopefully they take them off Facebook but for now there's not much we can do. Be thankful someone is taking there time just to do this rather than bitch and throws stones."
,galobh,2012-07-12T21:06Z,This release is as good as any web rip from facebook i've seen. Thank you scene4all
