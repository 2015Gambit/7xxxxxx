,madmarkus,2012-07-11T15:45Z,"It says ""Aired: 2012-07-16"" as in ""next week""??? Just wondering."
,tflagger997,2012-07-11T20:48Z,"ROFL - This does not air for 5 more days (July 16).  So either this is fake, or you have a real scoop!"
,maveric90,2012-07-12T10:32Z,I was initially skeptical but its the real deal. Fantastic considering here we haven't even got to season 5 yet 
,madmarkus,2012-07-12T10:35Z,I watched it. He has a real scoop. It is the actual episode 13!
,GrOuNdZeRo30,2012-07-12T10:39Z,Holy Crap!  Way to go FaMoUz!  This is actually 5 days early.  Thanks for the scoop.  Great episode!

,la_cross37,2012-07-15T00:17Z,"This is actually the real deal. It's S05E13 and I just watched episode 12 so I'm sure that this is episode 13.

I'm not going to watch it though, I'm going to wait for an HD version."
