,bobbyGa,2012-07-14T19:52Z,"forced subtitles only (for spanish dialogue):

http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4593546/get-the-gringo-en

syncs perfectly with this YIFY version. "
,Dig1taL,2012-07-22T02:45Z,"Hardcoded subtitles over the spanish would've been nice, since I was unable to get the subs to work I didn't understand about 30% of the movie :/"
,CH33ZEBURG3R,2012-08-05T06:22Z,"YIFY your uploads are excellent Video wise but some of the Audio is really low, this is one of them, turning my Surround Sound up to the Max and it still sound low?

It only happens on some of you uoploads not all of them."
,-G-rad,2012-08-06T09:55Z,Good Mel Gibson's film - quality good enough for me. It's great considering only 600MB size!
,bones1214,2012-08-10T22:16Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. There are no English subtitles when spanish is being spoken and half the movie is in spanish.
And to anyone uploading, dont bother if you dont know what your doing. Your wasting everyone time."
,soletar,2012-08-17T06:01Z,"My favorite film so far for 2012 ( bi haven't watched any summer movie)....

i rushed to watch it because i wanted to delete it from hard drive because  after scanning through it looks a ""dirty"" and ""grimy"" movie. 


Was pleasantly surprised. Mel Gibson is so talented. *spoiler alert* he did a perfect Clint Eastwood imitation, really was hilarious"
