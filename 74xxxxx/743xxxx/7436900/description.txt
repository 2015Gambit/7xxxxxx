Plot Summary:..

The Amusement Club foursome continue their unusual activities - though still not clearly defined, organised, or explained - in the illegally-occupied-by-the-club room of the former tea ceremony while the student council continues to attempt to shut them down. Meanwhile Akari is no longer a dotted outline in the background. She is loved and adored by her classmates and teachers alike. This marks a new year for the ultra-popular Akari!
