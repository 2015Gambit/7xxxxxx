I have not filed a complaint with the moderators because your PDF contains substantial useful information, not just a couple pages riddled with ""click here"" links.

But do not post the URL of your commercial site in any other torrent description or I will follow through with the complaint."

I know ignorance is no excuse but I was unaware. I can't seem to be able to edit the description to take it out. I see so much other stuff on this site I thought it would be ok. So if anybody knows how to edit the description to remove the link, I'll be happy to.

Thanks."
