,Kikee_31,2012-07-10T22:18Z,"WHAT THE HELL?? What happened 2 ur Green Skull @extremezone?? Everybody knows that the one Uploader in here that tops all others is YOU! and i say that based on every torrent ive ever downloaded from u over the past couple(few?) years and every comment i've ever seen posted on ur pages about those torrents!! ALWAYS, ONLY THE HIGHEST PRAISE; aside from the occasional troller remark being made, 2 which a billion people fly 2 ur defense! I sincerely hope the reason 4 taking ur Green Skull was to have it  replaced with a GOLD one, because thats the only reason that makes any sense!!. Sorry 4 such a long winded comment but i take my pirating (AKA WoooHooo FREE MOVIES!!) very seriously and am grateful 2 the ones that make it possible! So, thanks EZ. We all kno that u should have ur own Gold skull next to ur name! 

...sorry people, i was an A.D.D. kid & im all out of Ritalin. jk"
,Dem047,2012-07-10T23:04Z,oh okay EX i really hope you will get it soon !!! you deserve more than VIP !! God bless you !!! :))
,SgtGoldy,2012-07-11T01:08Z,"He lost his green skull for several reasons. You can read them all here: https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=51581

stop whining, the mods did what they felt was best."
[V],extremezone,2012-07-11T01:48Z,"SgtGoldy that threat it's from 13th October 2009, my vip account was removed on about 21 06 2012 for the reason i requested a torrent uploaded by and anonymous user on wrong category with wrong name becase was my torrent ""stoled"" from another torrent site because i delayed few minutes oploading on tpb, made the mistake requesting two times when moderators told me they can't help me...and for this reason because of my mistake on SUPRBAY FORUM he removed my trusted vip account from TPB ...not fair if you ask me but they told me in about two weeks will see if they will promote me again to vip, maybe this will happen since it's pretty annoying capcha thing

next time stop adding false informations please and enjoy downloading quality torrents as always"
