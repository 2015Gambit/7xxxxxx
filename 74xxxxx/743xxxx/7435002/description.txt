Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Wednesday, July 11th on the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the gradual acclimatization of military into local government and police functions, as witnessed in the latest news revealing the U.S. Air Force working in Florida to spray "where heavy concentrations of mosquitos have been reported." 

He'll also cover the run-up to the RNC in Tampa where Orwellian orders have been given to garbage workers to "spot suspicious activity on their routes" and be mindful of any persons "taking an undue interest" in trash bins. 

In the third hour, Alex welcomes Dan Feidt, who posted a U.S. Army Civil Disturbance Operations training course document instructing soldiers to break up "unauthorized gatherings" by "dissident elements" in the United States. Feidt also runs the site HongPong.com, a website dedicated to exposing "information operations, spinstorms, and latent contraditions."
