Doco-USA-National.Geographic_Death.Collectors-Jul2012.avi (If you like comics - watch this!)

if youre into comic book men then you will like this massive comic collection
including a spider man collection worth 120K
docu/doco is about finding relatives to people who died alone
to give them any valuables

help to seed if grabbing!

enjoy

PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.
