That Girl is Poison

Jenna's extravagant birthday party seems to be too
good to be true and Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer
think something else might be up - especially when
it turns out that Garrett is getting a pass out of
jail to visit his ailing mother on the same night.
The timing can't just be a coincidence the Liars
are convinced it all has to do something with "A."
With Emily getting an insiders' view working the
party, Aria working the crowd as a party-goer and
Spencer staked out at the hospital, what could go
wrong? The answer is - everything. Meanwhile,
Hanna's wallowing through heartbreak leads her to
a shocking discovery.
