Marc Stevens' book Adventures in Legal Land in word .docx format, I took the original mangled 'ebook' pdf version, ran it through OCR (the text layer was gobbledygook) and then went through it over a couple of days and fixed most of the errors. Hence it may have a few glitches in it but should be generally good. Spread this far and wide, the knowledge in this book needs to be known by as many people as possible.
