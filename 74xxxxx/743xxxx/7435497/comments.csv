How about you try some QUALITY encodes for a change. These lowbitrate files are a joke."
,YFNShyne-Box,2012-07-12T09:24Z,THANK YOU.
,sherwinx666,2012-07-12T11:13Z,what's with protos? are you some kinda alien or somethin'?
[V],YIFY,2012-07-12T12:48Z,"What are you talking about.. The quality is amazing for this file size, and fyi most people cant play 10 bits on their media players we we run 8 bits. "
,sherwinx666,2012-07-13T13:54Z,"Thanks a lot yify....
A = 10
V= 10
M = 10
Subtitles = 10
The best quality as always...

@protos.. you need to go to the doctor and have your eyes and ears checked..."
,bobbyGa,2012-07-14T21:03Z,"how does this compare with FASM release? specifically audio?

Wish some uploaders would give a little more attention to audio. Picture is usually outstanding, but audio sometimes compressed to radio quality. Still great work your doing YIFY team!"
,spopes232,2012-07-30T01:56Z,"well, yifys last release of lotr extended was total crap. hoping the file size here entails some quality, though i'd appreciate some audio bitrate info... that was the main problem with the previous releases. audio was about a 3, no exaggeration. "
,HuxleyRdr,2012-08-01T15:20Z,"Video is ok, not great quality. Audio is very poor and low. V: 7 / A: 5."
,bodders17,2012-09-12T16:22Z,very good
