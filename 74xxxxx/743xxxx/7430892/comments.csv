,Nabakin,2012-07-10T19:05Z,This seems like way too small of a file size for a OS
,tmemphist,2012-07-10T21:32Z,"Mountain Lion Developer Preview (DP5) is close to 4GB.  How is the Golden Master 145MB? 

Would you mind explaining this discrepancy for us simple ppl, please? "
,4seed2u,2012-07-10T21:43Z,@tmemphist Read carefully.Its server and not the Mountain Lion os itself.The os is 4GB and more
,Kumla,2012-07-10T21:58Z,It says Lion SERVER.. Maybe that's why....
,Jesusfunk,2012-07-11T05:32Z,"As of Lion, the Server software is a standalone application (which installs some system modifications to say ""OS X Server"" along with the actual server software) not a full installation. It's small size is due to it needing a full installation of 10.8 before it modifies it to 10.8 Server."
,jbrrr,2012-07-12T02:36Z,Thanks!  Apple Remote Desktop 3.6 when you can please.

It reads:
""Error enabling server management:
A Problem was detected with Server. Please redownload Server from the App Store.""

Then it forces me to quit installation. "
