,benj_pagt,2012-07-12T04:29Z,"Thanks for this wonderful game. Works perfectly on my phone (Sony Xperia Pro). Although it installs on my Samsung Galaxy Tab P1010, the game is stuck on the opening screen. I can't press any button to start the game. I hope a version that works for such tablet will be around soon."
,benj_pagt,2012-07-12T06:24Z,Problem solved. I did some research. The game has to be started while the tablet's screen is in landscape mode.
,megashock,2012-07-12T18:58Z,"Same thing in Galaxy S2.
the game has to be restarted while the phone screen is in landscape mode, in order not to freez in the opening screen."
