,mothermonster,2012-07-12T20:15Z,"Thanks for this upload! The quality is experienced best on an actual TV. My mac computer screen is HD so it does not look crystal clear but on my TV this looks perfect. 
On computer screen: 
V: 8/10
A10/10"
,pinzmoo,2012-07-13T13:34Z,"SPOILER ALERT --- this movie sucked so bad.

thx for the up"
,ZombieWarez,2012-07-29T01:30Z,^^^ I hate when idiots review the movie instead of the quality
,jc7621,2012-07-29T02:15Z,"Downloading now. Will comment on quality after watching. I've been downloading a while here, but I've decided after seeing so many people giving horribly bad reviews and trying to take us to fake sites, I'm gonna comment on every video I download from now on. "
,Fritz.,2012-07-29T06:40Z,"@zombiewarez ... and your comment was so much more useful.


the internet : showing the rest of the world your stupidity one post at a time."
,Fritz.,2012-07-29T11:12Z,"great quality for the size of the rip.

the movie itself is rather dumb. the girl is crying and whining through 90% of the movie and the suspense scenes are all pretty predictable."
,jc7621,2012-07-30T14:43Z,"Great quality, especially for only being 700 mb. Some of the really dark scenes were a TAD bit hard to watch, but great great copy. A 10 V 8 ."
,camaysar,2012-07-31T06:37Z,"Why don't people keep their opinions to themselves? If I want a review, I'll go to the professionals, who might also disagree with my opinions but at least have some background in film criticism. Just comment on AV quality!"
,camaysar,2012-07-31T07:04Z,"@Fritz: Some posters will be dissuaded from writing ""reviews"" if they read enough posts that criticize the practice. Btw, your post was the most useless of them all!"
,Gr33nThumb420,2012-08-04T16:41Z,Thanks for the upload. Movie wasnt worth it though.. Very stupid in my opinion. It has a cool twist to it.. but it just wasn't long enough for my liking.
,blingdoc,2012-08-14T02:49Z,"this is the BEST print I've come across!! 
A:10/10
V:10/10
M: from what I hear 8/10.. I have yet to watch it!"
,lizardomanson,2012-08-20T14:11Z,"No one cares if you liked the movie or not, don't be dumbshit, maybe others will like. Review the quality of the sound/video."
,bluerainbug,2012-08-28T17:01Z,I'm not downloading but saw the comments. I'd really like to add that comments posted should only be about quality not story. peace out!
,Biglite,2012-09-02T02:32Z,"Who cares if they write reviews? A/V reviews are just as worthless
(same movie)
Person 1 - A: 3/V: 4
Person 2 - A: 8/V: 10

I can't believe some of you people seem angered by this trivial nonsense. "
,.235.,2012-09-06T17:15Z,great quality (the highs were a little distorted) and the cinematography made me want to vomit but good quality otherwise.
