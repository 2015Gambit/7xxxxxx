Folder Guard for Windows 7, Vista, XP
 

Folder Guard is a powerful computer security program that you can use to control access to files, folders, and other Windows resources, such as Control Panel, Start Menu, and so on. You can use Folder Guard to lock your personal files and folders with passwords, to stop other users from peeking into your records. You can even completely hide your private folders from virtually all applications, and such folders would remain invisible until you enter a valid password. You can also protect sensitive system files from modification or destruction, disable access to the removable drives, restrict access to Control Panel, and more.

 You can protect with password virtually any folder or file, allowing only authorized users to open the protected files or folders. You can protect an unlimited number of files and folders, each with its own password, or you can use the Master Password of Folder Guard to unprotect them all at once
 Folder Guard runs on a wide range of Windows platforms.

 From Windows 2000 to Windows XP to Windows 7 and later, with all service packs and hotfixes, all are supported by Folder Guard.

 Folder Guard sports one of the most intuitive user interfaces, that makes it easy to use for both novice users and computer professionals.
