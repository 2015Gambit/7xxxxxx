Pariah features standard first-person shooter gameplay, largely influenced by the Unreal franchise, particularly Unreal 2 (whose game engine Pariah is based on). The single-player and multi-player game feature drivable vehicles that may be used in combat. The game's most remarkable feature is the use of collectible Weapon Energy Cores with which to upgrade the player's weapons, giving them additional features and greater power. Each weapon in the game can be upgraded a total of 3 times.

This is an extract and play version, patched with the 1.3 patch. I have tested it on several PCs, with no problems. Nothing has been removed or re-encoded.

I have included Xpadder with my Xbox360 and PS3 profiles, output size is 2.35 gig on disk.

I downloaded a highly compressed version from TPB, but it had no major cut scenes, so I bought the game.
