,secretiveness,2012-07-12T01:12Z,"hi guys!
Thanks for upload.
I've got the problem. After installation when I wanted to play appeard window saying ""it looks like you've got unofficial modification of game which doesn't fix to game The Sims 3 you've got alredy. We recommend uninstall those modifications or get updated versions of them - in other way game could crush or will appear significant errors"" 
smth like that (sorry English isn't my native language)
I installed it exacly like in instructions here.

And maybe it's important beside crack TS3W in The Sims 3 folder I've got other cracks in stuff and expansion pack folders like old way to crack I did this after installing Pets.

Any help? Please?"
,Horenso,2012-07-16T20:34Z,"@Secretiveness You probably updated your game to 1.36 and if u had any mods like awesomemod or Nraas or slider hacks that increase space, you need to have a compatible version of the mod. Hope this helps! also check your mod versions and your base game version. For now, ur basegame version is important"
,Lounce12,2012-07-18T20:16Z,"Hello
I cant find the crack anywhere in the folder :(
I've just downloaded every single expansion pack and when opening this last one it says that I need to insert the cd.
I've tried looking around for a mod (or whatever its called) that can fix it. Think I found some ""NoCD"" mod.. but it shouldnt be necessary if this one has a crakc right?
But rly if im not blind or something, nowhere in this file is there any ""crack"" :("

,NeishaG,2012-07-26T02:30Z,"Thanks for the upload :-) It installed and everything but I'm getting a ""Disk Authorization Failure"" Message, and I don't know how to fix this :-("
,joespeed2,2012-08-01T11:14Z,"i downloaded this and immediately started having problems with dns on my computer, spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on with my internet then decided to run malware bytes. malware bytes quarantined this file and then everthing went  back to normal"

,BethDeg,2012-08-22T23:18Z,"When ever i go to play the game it say disk authorization failure, how do i get it to work?"
,goodmcgee,2012-08-22T23:35Z,I click on AutoRun and it brings up the Updater. I go into my File Explorer and look for the Setup.exe itself but it says that I have to uninstall my current version of TS3 in order to install this version because the version I'm trying to install is an older version. What do I do?
,pauloma91,2012-08-24T16:28Z,"hello guys, I have a problem. I have all the sims 3 installed. but now when I play the sims 3 diesel stuff while I choose my clothes but the game crashes! someone could help me. Sorry my engish"
