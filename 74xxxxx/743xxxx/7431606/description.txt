Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, July 10th edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the ongoing outrageous behavior by the TSA and their latest debacle which involves laughing at and stealing candy from a deaf man. He also talks about the recent executive order issued by the White House that seeks to give government unprecedented new authority over wired and wireless private communication networks, and the imminent threat and increasing likelihood of unmanned spy drones being used against American citizens on US soil.  

Scheduled to be on in the third hour, but did not appear (phone problems?): Rosalind Peterson of California Sky Watch to talk about U.S. Navy Expansion Plans for the Atlantic, Pacific, and the Gulf of Mexico ... the devastating, seemingly sporadic weather patterns occurring all over the US in terms of weather modification, and ... the impending drone threat.
