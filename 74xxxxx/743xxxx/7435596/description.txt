Geeda was born and raised in the inner city of Chicago, where he would developed his style. Geeda has always had a love for music even as a child he would beat pots and pans until his mom couldn't take it any more, discovering that he had a passion for music he would sing in school choir and play the drums. At a very young age he gave his life to Christ at the age of eight, growing up in a God fearing family Geeda strayed away from God and became heavily worldly influenced. He first started rapping in the seventh grade idolizing Bone Thugs and Harmony; he would rap their verses until people thought he was Bone. He and his friends would go on to form a group of there own where they would record in his basement with an old radio. After a few years Geeda left the group and formed a duo group with a friend but that only lasted for so long. Eventually the path of life, Bad decisions, hard times and no sense of direction he tried a solo career as a rapper but lost motivation because he didn't have the proper equipment to record so he gave up rap entirely. Geeda would go on to pursue a career in trades and in the process he met his wife and everything changed he had a whole new outlook on life and he rededicated his life to Christ. Four years later He wanted to get back to doing music but this time for Christ, He thought it would cost a fortune! So he started to doubt his self until a friend told him about a software program that engineers use to produce music. Geeda learned and eventually mastered it and got back in the grove of rapping but glorifying Christ with his talents and showing youth god is cool. Geeda has been doing shows at churches and various events across the country with his first release Revelations in 2009 and now is stirring up buzz as he prepares for the release of his second album The Advent.
