,codyormoe,2012-07-12T05:15Z,About half way through descriptive narration kicks in.
,leo4710,2012-07-12T07:16Z,Whats up with the narration?
,username65234540,2012-07-12T08:28Z,Narration SOOO annoying.... Not worth it. I may have to stop my RSS feed from getting from ettv...
,username65234540,2012-07-12T08:38Z,They thought the show was so good that halfway through you would go blind by awesomeness.. So they switched to the narrative track
,acsmith1972,2012-07-12T09:54Z,"I don't know who's doing that ettv or what, but it's fucking annoying and not clever in any way. It'd be sort of like me handing one of them a copy of the show then punching them in the nose just for effect. "
,acsmith1972,2012-07-12T09:54Z,Now I have to go find a non-ettv copy and hope they're not corrupted by fucking retards.
