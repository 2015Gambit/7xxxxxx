Hi:

This is a package with four modes of the most famous minecraft 1.2.5 (latest version), which are: Smartmoving, Mo-creatures, Animal Bike and My Little Pony, including textures and servers.

I work a cock to ride these modes, because the kids of the guys who throw the mode does not pose the "jar" which can be given a bitch work for us. Today, however, will not collect anything, because you are all my friends (ha ha ha).

Here, too, the respective servers for each mode. The My Little Pony may perhaps be thrown on the server of Mo-creatures, which is based in Forge.

All these modes are organized in super-cool Multi-MC, which is a repository that launches each mode independently.

If you do not have an accountcan play offline without specifying a name or a password.

To install: Open the Multi-MC folder, create a shortcut to MultiMC.exe, place this shortcut wherever you want, and play.
The folders of the servers can be anywhere. Just also create a shortcut for each "run.bat", configure the "server.proprietats" entering data from your server, such as IP number, etc..

Enjoy
