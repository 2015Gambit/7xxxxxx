Jacques Peretti examines assumptions about what is and is not healthy. He also looks at how product marketing can seduce consumers into buying supposed 'healthy foods' such as muesli and juices, both of which can be high in sugar. 

He speaks with Simon Wright, an 'organic consultant' for Sainsbury's in the 1990s, who explains how the food industry cashed in on the public's concerns around salmonella, BSE and GM crops. By 1999 the organic industry was worth over ┬ú605M, a rise of 232% within two years. 

Peretti speaks with Kath Dalmeny, former policy director at the Food Commission, who explains some of the marketing strategies used by mainstream food producers to keep our custom. 

The programme also explores the impact of successive government initiatives and health campaigns, such as the proposal of 'traffic light labelling'. 

But in 2012, when we have an Olympic Games sponsored by McDonalds and Coca Cola, has anything changed?
