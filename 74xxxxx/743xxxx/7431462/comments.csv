This torrent works fine, but your install info is a bit confusing. Remember to tell people that you have no mac. You have revitalized the mac section and made us all very happy.

By the way - Where the f... is polisdavid???

Installing this is easy. First shut down internet connection. Then unzip and install the software.

An automatic registration option will start. Shut down this and go to the Oneone folder in Applications.

Open folder and click ""License manager"". Now click on the import license option in the top menue. 

Now open the keygen and generate a 15 digit activition code. Type it and click ok (the ok button)

Use Little Snitch and block software. I do it always. Open internet and you have the best resize software ever ready to go....

I am not shure if I got the right names on all buttons, but you will understand anyway. 

Installed this on a friends mac lion and it worx perfect."
,mac.the.ripper,2012-07-12T22:30Z,"Sorry everybody....

My install guide is not for this torrent. Its for the Perfect Resize 7.

Im on heavy oxy painkillers and a bit high so I should probably shut down internetz and chill.

Anyway - great torrentz openarena. Thank you for sharing and caring."
