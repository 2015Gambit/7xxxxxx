,daco1xxl,2012-07-11T23:06Z,Whats the word people??? good audio???
,thebigblaks,2012-07-12T00:30Z,Very good audio and video but missing 13 min of the movie about
[T],VaultRelease,2012-07-12T03:01Z,"Audio=7
Video=6

I've yet to watch it all the way through so I have no idea if thebigblaks's comment about 13 minutes missing is accurate."
,thebigblaks,2012-07-12T03:39Z,well its probably 9 or 10 min to be more accurate because you have to count credits but the movie is 2 hours and 16 min this cam here is 2 hour and 3 min so it is incomplete but it is very good quality I dont c y ppl r complaining about the quality its perfect if u dont mind the few missing parts its nothing that major as far as i can tell
,Domeynut,2012-07-12T03:45Z,"The duration of this file is 123 minutes.  According to IMDB the duration of the movie is 136 minutes.  Would seem the comment about 13 minutes missing is correct based off that assumption.  I have not downloaded nor watched the movie, so take it as you wish."
,Domeynut,2012-07-12T03:46Z,What parts are missing exactly?  Is it a block missing in the beginning or end or middleish?  Or just bits and pieces cut out here and there?
,thebigblaks,2012-07-12T03:52Z,sorry figured what its missing would be probably 2-4 min tops so not as much as i thought
,CDonahue,2012-07-12T09:22Z,"Keeping in mind this is a CAM

A: 7
V: 6

Best audio / Video I have seen yet for a CAM.

Havn't watched the full thing to see what parts are missing if any."
,CDonahue,2012-07-12T11:23Z,"Just finished watching the whole thing, the video gets slightly bad at parts but it is defiantly watchable, Audio is good for a CAM and I didn't see any parts of the movie that was missing or at least noticeably missing. This was the first time I saw the movie however.

A: 7
V: 5
M: 6"
,Jereth8,2012-07-12T12:08Z,it is missing the stan lee cameo and the rest of the action scenes in the highschool. downloaded a few on here and all of them are missing those awesome scenes
,yohomofo,2012-07-12T18:37Z,"how the eff do you miss scenes? I watched MIB3 and the last 10 minutes was missing, I'm sorry, but good or not I can't be missing scenes. "
,thebigblaks,2012-07-12T19:55Z,"its not really missing anything important and the only thing that it cuts in the middle of is the school scene, which u can find some of those scenes on youtube at least the stan lee cameo, if u download them u could cut them back in"
,vpsj,2012-07-14T19:19Z,can anyone provide the subtitles for this one please..?
