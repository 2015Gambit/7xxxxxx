Same story stretches from "Zombie Crisis 3D"...
When Dana ( "Zombie Crisis 3D" ) is tracing the PV37 virus, there's another colleague hunting for the same goal. Her partner Fox, being appointed the task not long before, has already slipped into Argo Company.
Will Fox then finish the mission Dana left when wounded? Or will Argo spreads the PV37 virus throughout the world?

The final war is now drawing near...
