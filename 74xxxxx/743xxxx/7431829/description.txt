NOTE:
Though the majority of the film is a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the Blu-ray features some scenes (shot with IMAX cameras) in 1.78:1. I happen to think that's one of the dumbest things a genius filmmaker has ever done (the aspect ratio switches are EXTREMELY distracting to me) so this encode is 2.40:1. No whining.
