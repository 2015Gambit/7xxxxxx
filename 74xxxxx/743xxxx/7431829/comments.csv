[T],tr108,2012-07-11T04:01Z,"You're welcome guys.

@jeanpaul_96 - I hadn't thought of it. But if I come across the blu-ray (a lot of my encodes are the result of my friends buggin' out with gift certificates) I'd love to do it."
,VladDj123,2012-07-11T13:50Z,Perfect timing dude ! Thanks for keeping your promise ! I'll keep seeding ;)
,dilligaf247,2012-07-11T22:29Z,"Techrod108, your uploads are what legends are made of. Is there anyway we can donate to the cause (gift certificates of Paypal)?"
,IronPumper1986,2012-07-12T17:04Z,"Thanks, dude!! Are you gonna do the Fast & The Furious series? If not, at least Fast Five?

Thanks again!"
,jlavoie,2012-07-13T04:36Z,Any possibility getting inception itunes 720p? want to get a Chris Nolan collection started before Dark Knight Rises : )
[T],dabadguy69,2012-07-13T05:12Z,Thanks for the awsome torrents!!!
[T],tr108,2012-07-14T00:15Z,"@VladDj123 - lol, I didn't think anyone actually paid attention when I said I'll up something on such-and-such day. Glad you are!

@IronPumper1986 - I *am* a fan of the series but I don't think I'll get to any of the F&F films.

@jlavoie - In term of building your Chris Nolan collection, I see your Inception and raise you a Memento! (But no more Nolan films, I'm afraid - I don't know anyone who has Insomnia or The Prestige on BD)

@dabadguy69 - you're welcome. I've noticed you also do iTunes ups-- good stuff! 

@dilligaf247 - I really appreciate the thought, but all I can really ask is folks seed. Btw, since I know you're interested in encoding & tagging yourself, the step-by-step will happen, in mid-August or so, so stay tuned for that. All my tricks will be revealed. :)"
,nimster09,2012-07-23T22:32Z,is this avi?
,RobertoHN,2012-07-26T19:17Z,"THANKS A LOT Unbelievable work, !!!!

Definitely I would like to know your secret and I'll be waiting for your encoding and tagging guide eagerly since I have an Apple TV and I also have some BD movies that I like to add to my library.

My rate for this movie is V10/A9/M7.5"
,Mikiah,2012-08-04T23:13Z,This only plays with iTunes?
,RobertoHN,2012-08-06T07:30Z,"@Mikiah
