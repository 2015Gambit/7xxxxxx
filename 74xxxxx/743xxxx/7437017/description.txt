Sansho DayuΓÇª is the triumphant summation of MizoguchiΓÇÖs style and themes, as well as the most compassionate response imaginable to those atrocities which had been committed in then very recent years, in Japan and all over the world. It is the most humanist of films, but it asserts that humanism is powerless without politics, just as politics is purposeless without humanism. The last sequence is the most perfect ending in cinema, so broad in implication, so exquisite in form. The reunion of mother and son ΓÇô the revelation of human love ΓÇô is at once the most important thing in the world, and an event insignificant against the panorama of human suffering. The double perspective ΓÇô never to see things in isolation, always in context ΓÇô is assured by MizoguchiΓÇÖs style, and defines his art. Sansho Dayu is, in Gilbert AdairΓÇÖs words, ΓÇ£one of those films for whose sake the cinema existsΓÇ¥.
