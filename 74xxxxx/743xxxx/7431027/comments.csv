,Matrix235813,2012-07-11T00:50Z,"Whenever I put in the fake account ( i did use the magic launcher) I get this:

*** MagicMinecraftLauncher 0.9.8 ***
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: net.minecraft.client.Minecraft

,w4r3zh4ck,2012-07-11T01:08Z,"Seems like you must install the latest version of Java Runtime http://www.filehippo.com/download_jre_32/

Mine is working fine though :/"
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-07-11T01:15Z,Tested this three times and its working. Make sure you have the latest Java Runtimes and make sure that the paths of JRE and minecraft on the magic launcher are correct.
,Matrix235813,2012-07-11T03:08Z,"Ok, so I downloaded the Jave Runtime link you provided, but I still get the same message. (I am pretty new to this whole thing, so I don't really know what I am doing, sorry). What do you mean by ""make sure that the paths of JRE and minecraft on the magic launcher are correct?"""
,DiamondAc,2012-07-18T06:00Z,You have to put it in %appdata% for it to work!
,rbbhws,2012-08-05T12:44Z,Hey man love what you've done. Runs great. Could you do the same for 1.3.1? Or perhaps give instructions on how to update it? Thanks.
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-08-05T20:15Z,@rbbhws I will make the same for 1.3.1 and every other version but I'm still waiting for the mods to become ready at the moment. My next remake will have a proper installer. It's gonna take a week or two
