This is a modded version of Minecraft by me, specially made to be FAST on low end computers such as netbooks with Intel GMA 950 chipsets. There are various texture packs included inside and the default one is 1x1 resolution. Yes, the game looks like CRAP, but if your slow PC can handle it then you should choose either 4x4, or 8x8, or 16x16 or the default texture pack.

Included mod: OptiFog Multi Core

The game options are set to the minimum. If you have a high end multi core and multi GPU computer, then this edition of Minecraft should be the perfect for you. P.S. You have to max out all the options on your high end PC by yourself.
As I said, this edition of Minecraft is configured out-of-the-box to be fast and crappy-looking on slow computers BUT it if you own a high end PC, configure everything to the max and enjoy !

******Special Notes******
Extract the archive and copy the .minecraft folder to %appdata%
ALWAYS launch the game by starting the "Magic Launcher.exe"
FOR THE FIRST TIME after you start Magic Launcher, go to options/advanced and set the memory to 256 MB
Use ANY account or a fake account and you should be able to play it offline.
