National Geographic - Taboo - Drugs - San Pedro, XTC, Peyote, Ganje

Taboo ΓÇô Drugs is a National Geographic Channel presentation, part of the Taboo documentary series highlighting various other taboos of our society. This episode features the San Pedro cactus, Peyote, Coca leaves and Ganja, which have all been part of shamanism in cultures around the world.

A psychoactive drug, psychopharmaceutical, or psychotropic is a chemical substance that crosses the bloodΓÇôbrain barrier and acts primarily upon the central nervous system where it affects brain function, resulting in changes in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, and behavior. These substances may be used recreationally, to purposefully alter oneΓÇÖs consciousness, as entheogens, for ritual, spiritual, and/or shamanic purposes, as a tool for studying or augmenting the mind, or therapeutically as medication.

This National Geographic documentary compares these cultures and modern day rave culture in which doctors and professionals attest to the validity of this spiritual experience.
