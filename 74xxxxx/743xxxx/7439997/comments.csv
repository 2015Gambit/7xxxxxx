[T],HighCode,2012-07-14T20:59Z,"crop 2x 20 px (black bars) then you get 1920/1040 = 1.84 AR.
1328 / 720 = 1.84 so it kept the original AR.
1280 / 688 = 1.86.

You tell us why is it pointless, and which resolution would be better and why, because you seem to be so smart.

,downloather,2012-07-15T21:09Z,"That's easy: the 720p format means a resolution of 1280x720 progressive. That's why a 720p video should fit _into_ that resolution.

Personal note: If I'm watching a video in 1280x688 the scaling of my TV to 1920x1080 produces better results than with one in 1328x720.

Another note: I guess nobody notices a difference in the aspect ratio comparing 1.84 to 1.86... ;)"

Ok, so you downloaded this torrent and 1280 / 688 AR torrent. Then show me a snap shot of each version taken at the same scene. Also which release is the other one.
Your fairytale doesn't make any sense. The height has to be modulus 16 for flawless playback.  I also watch my movies on 1080p plasma (106 cm diagonal) and never notice any tearing or other issues.

What exactly do you mean by ""produces better results""? That's only in your fantasy, isn't it lol..
 Your user name explains it... that you're just a troll trying hard to show off how smart you are but prove the contrary, what a noob you are.. 

You are a victim of the word ""standard"" and believe that any lengths other then 1920 and 1280 are wrong. ""Standard"" is also (not so long ago introduced in EU) that if the apple is not red enough it can not be sold, even though it tastes better then those red apples you find in big stores.

Many TV-s, monitors, laptops or/and graphic cards have different AR-s: 
1600/900, 1440/900, 1366/768, 1024/768..and about 20 more resolutions...
Why don't you go bitching on forums how wrong they are because in your opinion only 1920/1080 & 1280/720 are acceptable.."
