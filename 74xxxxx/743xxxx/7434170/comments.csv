psspss's lil bitch at that, too.
I know who joshgates is.
He's from my blog.
It sure as hell is not me.
But hey you can continue living in your fantasy world. You can think I have a dozen accounts. You can think I don't contribute anything. Your idea of reality is far from actuality. But if you're going to continue living in it, that's entertaining to me!

Only a moron would say this is about stealing and pirating. Get the fuck out. It's about sharing. And when someone does steal somebody's work and re-releases without credit given that is frowned upon and against etiquette.  Since you don't upload a damn thing, you're just an obnoxious leech and wouldn't know anything about all that.

If you would pull your noggin out of your ass crack for a split second and look around the internet you would see there's been other copies of DT out there.  Not just my copy, either. You act like TPB is the only place to get stuff.  That's an ""epic fail"". Do people even still say that?  I thought that was played out a couple years ago by all them teen bop, skinny jean wearing, emo bastards. That's sad, bro. Totally sad. Try being a little more original."
,Charlie117,2012-07-11T22:49Z,Yes! Thank you for 720p!
,Charlie117,2012-07-11T22:50Z,"Yes! Thank you for 720p!

[T],trialNerror,2012-07-13T00:22Z,"here to brag or bitch... just like you psspss!
you always brag about your shit and always bitch about mine :D

you n i use to be cool when i did xvid but as soon as i switched to x264 you became the most annoying dude in the universe. why? because it didn't play on your old gear? not my problem. because they didn't always convert nicely in your unknown freeware?  not my problem.

and hey DT 5x02 720p is on tpb now
