,ca1981,2012-07-13T03:03Z,"Differnces between this and ""The_Amazing_Spider-Man_2012_TS_AC3_5.1_XViD-sC0rp""

This Audio: MP-3 | 128 Kbps
Other Audio: AC-3 | 448 Kbps | 48.0 KHz

This Video: XviD | 640 x 256 | 23.976fps
Other Video: XviD | 640 x 256 | 25.000fps

I am guessing the other would have better quality audio
