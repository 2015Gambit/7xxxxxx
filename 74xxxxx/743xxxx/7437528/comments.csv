,Gimip,2012-07-12T22:39Z,really good torrent thx :) maybe it should need a new small one soon ;)
,highlyevolved210,2012-07-12T23:53Z,Just tried this on 7.37 and its working! Thanks!
,xDV8x,2012-07-13T02:49Z,"Well as of 7.38 unless you have this game trough steam you can not use custom maps. The ""Workshop"" broke this function.

Unless someone can fix the ""get custom map"" you will be stuck just playing campaign and challenge maps.  "

,highlyevolved210,2012-07-13T19:32Z,"hehes7, do you really have to post 3 times? Online is working fine for me. Check your firewall settings or if your using peerblock, disable it. xDV8x is right, no more custom maps."
,xDV8x,2012-07-13T22:35Z,"hehes7 are you connecting to steam or gamespy?
Gamespy is the only online you should use with non-steam games, and it works fine"
