This is a file of icons and folders compressed down to its lowest possible for quick transfer. This is not my work. These are not for commercial use only private. This is not an indicator to pirate and should only be used with items you own and have bought.  No. I will not include a list of anime used in this. There are over 3000 icons in just one folder. I have gone out and tried to find something for every anime if I have missed something I apologize, I am always looking for new icons, anime but sadly, I am only human, and there are too many anime too track them all. If you have a special request, I ask you to comment so that I can look for the anime. 
Side note: Do not comment saying there are duplicates if they are not. Some look similar but have minor differences such as font size, position of folder tab, Color and other such differences. I left these in for personalization preferences on purpose. 

P.S. Some may be sorted between their jap and Eng. names if you see that there are any that are split comment and I will fix in a future torrent. 
A special thanks to contributions from Chronochaos, Kevin, and others whom I missed and apologize, as I am tired when writing this.  
Please Seed.
