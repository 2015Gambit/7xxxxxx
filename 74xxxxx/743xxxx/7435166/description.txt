This torrent contains rips from the three-disc limited edition DVD set of TOUR2011 AGE QUOD AGIS Vol.1 [Europe & Japan] documentary on DIR EN GREY. The first two discs are the main documentary discs. They have some more traditional documentary footage mixed in with some good, live concert footage. The narration of the documentary parts is in English. The Japanese VobSub subtitles are included. The third disc is primarily live concert footage with a small section of documentary that has no narration. Unfortunately, there are no English subtitles for the Japanese interview parts.



Note: These are 10-bit/Hi10P rips. If you cannot play them, update your player and/or video decoder. Media Player Classic - Home Cinema and VLC should both support these videos natively. They have been tested with these two players, but the rips should still work with other players if they support Hi10P videos. If you still have trouble, comment here or on my site, and I'll try to help you out.
