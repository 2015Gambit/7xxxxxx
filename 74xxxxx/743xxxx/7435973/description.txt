King Cobra (a.k.a. GothicKingCobra52) offers his most recent work, a collection of music blending elements of alternative metal, industrial rock, electronic music and hip-hop to create a sound all its own. Discordant and passionate, the clanging noise of "The Highway of Life" recalls albums like Nine Inch Nails' "Pretty Hate Machine" and My Bloody Valentine's "Loveless" but make no mistake; Josh Saunders is much more seamlessly intense than anyone who has come before him, and his work is, in some ways, incomparable.
