[V],MgB,2012-07-27T14:37Z,@ zathras69 - LoL no way .... i checked it myself no probs watsoever:)
,zathras69,2012-08-03T09:13Z,"Then you need to check it again.  The first occurs at 2:59-3:01.  It  is intermittent, it happens 5-6 times, more during the last 1/2 hour. Check it. http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/4129/41892635.png"

[V],MgB,2012-08-03T12:08Z,"zathras69 - Oh that hard coded parden me for that  i thought some hard sub occur ureleated to the movie, many sources had that , but the quality was good so encoded from that :) no worries i din felt bad 4m the comment :)"
,zathras69,2012-08-03T13:09Z,"I'm pretty sure it was just the source, Feel-Frees is the same way. This is the 1st time I've ever seen that before.  The quality of your uploads is exceptional, I have 22 of your DLs, they are the perfect size and the right bit-rate (2000-3000), they always look great.  I did DL another at a lower bit-rate (without the artifact) and I thought the picture quality difference was pretty obvious. Sorry there's no PM on here. Keep grinding them out cuz I'll be DLing!"
