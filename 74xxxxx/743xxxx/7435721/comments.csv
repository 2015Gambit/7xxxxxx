[T],xgimpyx,2012-07-13T03:34Z,the ep 10x7 of LMAO that was uploaded is incorrectly labled. They went by tvrage which is wrong and did not account for the week off that was not previously scheduled. That's what happens when you only cap an episode every once in awhile and don't commit to the season. 
[T],xgimpyx,2012-07-13T03:53Z,"To be more specific the episode 10x4 ""Traffic Jammin"" was originally scheduled to air June 20, 2012 but for some reason it was pulled and only repeats aired that night. 10x4 then aired the next week but tvrage still showed that a new episode aired on the 20th and it didn't. You can see on trutv schedule that July 11th episode was in fact 10x6.
