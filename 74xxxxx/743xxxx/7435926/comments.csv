,wwino37,2012-07-13T01:12Z,Thank You!  I'm usually only able to catch the buffy and angel comics at the end of the week with the whole weeks worth of scans.  Not many people upload them individually.  Thanks again
,RummyKid,2012-07-13T07:09Z,Well thats all gonna change now...i'll try do all the buffy issues from now on
