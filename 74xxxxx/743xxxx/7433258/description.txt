Ashok R. Tilak lives in Dinkapur with his    
widowed mother, and a servant named Bahadur. 
He travels to another town on a business     
trip to buy several acres of grape-bearing   
trees, with Bahadur accompanying him.        
Although this is his first trip to this town,
however, everyone appears to know him and Bah
including the Ticket Checker at the Railway  
Station, the taxi-driver, the Hotel Manager, 
local Police Inspector Sinha, a Jeweler named
Chhedilal and his assistant Mansoor, and to  
top it all a woman named Sudha claims that   
she is his wife, and another woman named Tanu
claims that she is his sister-in-law, while a
third one named Alka claims that she is his  
mistress. All's not well for Bahadur either  
for he bears the brunt of this confusion when
he finds out that he has a wife named Prema; 
a normally sane boss, who keeps on sniffing  
snuff and smoking alternatively,             
and who yells and slaps him frequently...
