here is the link 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7437558/cachemanxp_2.20_by.._marathaempire"
,xpmule,2012-07-12T22:37Z,"he uploaded it but i have that release from team FFF if people need it..
variety is nice i don't mean to attack this torrent or anything, i don't know anything about this program i havn;t used it but i have used CachemanXP and its not too bad a little program and light on resources. Just remember that if you have Vista/Win 7/Win 8 you can't use CachemanXP you would have to use the other version called simply ""Cacheman"" and that one by iOTA is already uploaded to TPB"
