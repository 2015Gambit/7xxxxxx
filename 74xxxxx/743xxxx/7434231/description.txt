This time an image from the set 214. For the hot area, I've taken PS to help. Diagonal and bruised is very difficult to implement.

As a little bonus I have enclosed a piece of artwork. Just for Fun.

Someone asked for pictures of Elvis and Jerry Lewis in the upper corners. I do not know what that means. =(

Wish everyone a good day
