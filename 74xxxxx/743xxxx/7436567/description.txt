Ghost Stories S01+S02 Complete - TravelTV (2009-2010) Para-Series xvid avi

dvd 640x360 1000bit AC3 audio (not mp3!)

heres another interesting docu paranormal series the big wig cappers
failed to supply to the p2p community .. aint you lucky someone at the bottom of the world can source and reshare all these great ufo and paranormal shows
without defacing them with logos and tags :)

the series features ghost stories. Each 30min episode showcases stories, legends and tales of different reportedly haunted locations in the United States. Although the info wiki says episode is 1 hour long
its not on the dvd rip but its probably incorrect info as usual!.. I guess they added some extra to the premeir only if not??
covers places 
From Trans-Allegheny to Moundsville Penitentiary

help to seed if grabbing!!

enjoy

PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.


===================================

note i will be blocking anyone i feel is not evenly sharing or limiting their upload speeds during initial seeding out.. beware of fake stats on seeders
here and use peer block and other ip soft
