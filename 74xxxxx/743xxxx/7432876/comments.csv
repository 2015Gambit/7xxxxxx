I use book torrents as a way of determine if the book is worth buying, as Kobo book preview gives me no more then a table of contents, not nearly enough to determine if I can actually use the book for my purpose.  I will buy the book if I like it.  I need it to learn xml quickly, enough to give me a background for linq to xml which I will be using via C# to develop a simple player login / preferences management for my upcoming math game and future games. 

If the publisher is reading this, consider talking to kobo about providing a better preview of your book if you dont like piracy."

The download is of top quality, thanks for the upload."
