,preda96,2012-07-13T00:38Z,Is this improving fps? 
,Zipgun,2012-07-13T06:05Z,"Fuck dude if your rig cant run this crap game. You need a new one or a new video card, as tried it on my home work PC using a I7 960 and triple 7970's. Overkill I know (I use it for video editing etc) but I can only use one card. As this game doesn't even work with crossfire enabled. 

Its also works on my gaming rig with dual 6970's and same story only works with CF disabled. Smooth as glass with max everything at 1920x1080.

The trouble with this game tho is the way it baby sits you throughout. Its like it plays itself definite console port. Can't wait till ARMAIII comes out.

So my rant aside NO this patch will NOT up you're FPS. It's mainly for input problems."
