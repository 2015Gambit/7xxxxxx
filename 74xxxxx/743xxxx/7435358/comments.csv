I think 2 people is not enough they need to join forcing both teams in to one

also cos they alert the town what they are doing and someone famous
from tv is there.. Im sure the teens would sneak out at night with their
own head gear IR and sneak behind the cameras and throwing sticks and rocks at them

having a bigger team would catch them.. 3 investigators and one
following them to filming extra footage and maybe catch more on their camera as well. DT have the better formula

also why no POVs.. she sits there and if someone sneaks by no camera facing that way to eliminate a animal or person..

and no thermal.. having thermal aimed both directions would be hard to fool
as well if some animal or person in the area..

i think the kids put out the fire my self and made sure to keep out of their camera range.. or dress up as a cow LOL"
[V],psspss,2012-07-12T07:52Z,"and then they could spend 3-4 days at same locations investigating as a larger team
and more chance to get stuff... and if they need to do interviews
wait til the end or send someone no one knows of tv to do it and report back with perhaps a few days between so they dont know an investigation is happening that week"

Excellent work psspss.

The one problem I have with all these paranormal show's is the goddamn sound tracks, filling in the voids with crappy suspense music. It really just cheapens what they are doing."
[V],psspss,2012-07-12T17:03Z,"music in alot of shows are darn annoying.. in fact
some are so loud gives me a headache

not just paranormal ones.. but many 

its a shame the music track is not made separate
so we can null it out..

,lotg4me,2012-07-13T04:43Z,"Thanks so much for this! Just wondering, would you be able to upload the last two episodes of this season's Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files? I've downloaded the files that were posted from TV Team and Sceneline and I cannot get any of them to play with VLC or any other media player. Your uploads are great and I never have any problem with them. Thanks."
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T05:44Z,"i did upload the last 2.. they called E23 and E24
as theres no season 3 listed on syfy.. so the other cappers are using some other naming for god knows why.. as they normally use whats syfy officially says.. but they called S03E10 and E11
