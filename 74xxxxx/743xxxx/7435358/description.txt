Haunted.Highway.S01E02.HDTV.XVID-][ Darkman of Standing Rock & Blackstar Shadow Man ][ 11-Jul-2012 ] avi

Devin and Jael venture to rural North Dakota to look into the case of what residents call the Dark Man which when spotted terrible things happen. Jack and Dana are in Blackstar Canyon, California, where shadowmen have been reported to be the cause of numerous disappearances in the area.

Most are comparing this episode to a bad remake of Blair Witch though

I see only 6 episodes are made of this show.. I really cant see it lasting
more then that as the investigations are bad..

unless you take it at entertainment only value its funny as at times

DT has the edge over this show though.


help to seed if grabbing.. 

enjoy

PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.
