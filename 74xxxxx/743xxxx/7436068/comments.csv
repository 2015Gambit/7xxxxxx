NO installation is required you simply double click the .exe (memTestPro.exe)
This is the windows version with a GUI.

I have not tested the DOS version (included)
And the files are all that came with the release. I didn't go and add any or anything. I'm assuming this is EXACTLY what you would have got if you bought it. I can't verify this though because iOTA's scene release was unpacked. Which is *one of the why i really prefer to get my warez releases as the group released them..
rather than people unpacking them and then spreading them all over.  (like i'm doing here lol)"
