[FSX] - FRANCEVFR - AUVERGNE PHOTO HD [RIP] (2012)

The PHOTO Regional product range provides a high resolution photoreal and terrain mesh coverage for each French region and island. This photoreal texture coverage replaces the standard Microsoft Flight Simulator X default scenery with a real lanscape. You can then add local sceneries onto this photoreal texture based for more realism.
