An urban contemporary film about adultery,    
murder and betrayal in the film noir style.   
A simple story to which the director imparts  
a feeling of unrest and disquiet, catching the
city in its various moods. The film breaks    
generic conventions, notably in the           
presentation of the private detective through 
his deglamourised life and his process of     
discovery of 'who did it'. It is not          
constructed through his point of view at all. 
In fact the policeman and the detective, the  
fact finders, are in the dark about the crime,
to the very end.
