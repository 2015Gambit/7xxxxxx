,Angelo85,2012-07-12T13:47Z,The torrent contains a .rar with Password protection. Say NO to password protection on TPB!
,Irlydont,2012-07-12T14:39Z,"G@Y Shit 

PASSWORD is so dumb

Say password or Fail Torrent.

Not a thx here"
,arildus,2012-07-12T17:17Z,Thanx:)
,killbat,2012-07-12T17:37Z,I have NEVER been asked for a password From Eztv.   Don't listen to the haters that want you to get the files from them shit is always a good download.
,mocthezuma,2012-07-12T17:59Z,"I'm trying to avoid fakes, but it's getting harder when ther's another account here called ettv that also has a VIP status and uploads what eztv uploads just a little later.

Just a heads up."
,d00fu5,2012-07-12T18:03Z,"@Angelo85 - This isn't even a .rar file. 

You are clearly mistaken."
,x5705734,2012-07-13T03:42Z,I just wanted to come to the defense of ettv. I thought it was shady as well but have not had any problems with their releases so far. But Eztv is the best thanks!
,haydnos,2012-07-13T04:34Z,"Thanks, Great quality.  A10/V8."
,xpmule,2012-07-13T08:29Z,"hey morons how do you put a password into an .mp4 video ?
LOL ..you don't ;)

ignore the people spreading lies
these people are always around spreading
false information on purpose to try and get people to think twice about downloading.

they either claim they received complaints from downloading from their isp etc
Or they claim a file is asking for a password when one is NOT required.

My best guess is these are people that are hired and contracted on behalf of well known companies to cause problems with P2P file sharing.
I could provide some examples of well known companies that do this but google is good enough ;)

Same sort of thing where people are paid to promote things on irc channels etc Like a movie or album etc
This shit really exists and we ALL need to be aware of this force at work against us..

See you in hell anti-piracy douche bags ;)
better call the websherriff(.com) to come and get me LOL"
,RaveHippie,2012-07-13T12:36Z,there are plenty or password protected rar files on tpb.... this however is NOT one of them... thanks as usuall eztv
,OmegaHax,2012-07-13T13:38Z,These Anonymous guys fake tv shows with false seeders and leechers -.-
,Angertek,2012-07-13T15:10Z,How can you say it not password protected when it obviouslly is. IF not this would be number one most seeders in futurama search. SOrry buddy but stop lying.
,Angertek,2012-07-13T16:20Z,SORRY I GUESS they fixed it but there was one version that was password protected...Now this is not password protected.
,Angelo85,2012-07-13T17:26Z,"Yeah that's weird, I downloaded this very torrent and it was a .rar with password honest to god!

Don't know what happened... no disrespect to all of you :D"
