Hello, Fellow Anons,

This multimillion dollar company thinks they own us. We don't need your control, we 
don't accept your control and your rules. You are only 1%, We are legion. We own you,
one way or another.

Being in eleven countries on six continents doesn't make u powerful, only vulnerable.
As we demonstrate today. We defaced your website, erased you from our internet. Also
we steal all your data which we are now sharing with the world. Your data is our data.

Think about that next time, when you try to own the world. You just got owned!

We are anonymous,
We are legion,
We do not forgive,
We do not forget,

You should have expected us!
