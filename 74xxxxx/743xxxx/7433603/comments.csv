[V],psspss,2012-07-11T13:15Z,"this source of this one looks like t-n-e as hes defaced it with a logo :) i didnt bother ridding it

but I didnt get it from his blog either.. ep1 is my own source.. I prob could find a non faced ep2 tomorrow if it worries people.. 

me I just want to watch it,,"
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-11T13:25Z,"nobody is going to complain about the tNe logo.

and hey. you're welcome. enjoy the show."
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T13:31Z,I see ryder is still in the team.. so guessing this was filmed before she left to join chasing ufos
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-11T14:01Z,"and please don't lie.
the other ep is not your own source.
that is a steamy crock of crap.
it's a syfy.com webrip."
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T14:14Z,:O
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T14:15Z,"thats right I ripped it from a commerical stream
so surely thats my source and effort

and no one leaked a url of your etc either..

but who cares right.. not into this peddy stuff"
,blackdragon13,2012-07-11T16:16Z,I haven't finished downloading either ep yet but thank you and really i dont care whose it is as long as i get to watch it
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T18:06Z,"and tne stop with creating multiple accts and posting under different names

you such stupid cunts really.. 

you may notices 100s and 1000s download my torrents daily and no posts anything bad
in fact the opposite.
"
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-11T19:36Z,"i swear on my grandmother's grave that isn't me. yes i recognize the name but it is not me. this is my only account.

feel free to talk about me though. doesn't bother me. you can hate on me eternally. lovin it!  i see even after i'm gone psspss still likes to get pissy about my x264 vids. lovely :) but there's been lots of stuff you and your buddies never would've had if i weren't around. so again; you're welcome! 

i don't care how many people download from you. i've had the same numbers. i've had the same praises. all part of sharing. don't get too whooptie doo excited over it. the fact that so many people are still relying on xvid is just silly. old gear. yea yea yea bla bla bla.  whatever. bullshit excuse. how much did they spend on that old gear? years ago cheap divx dvd players were about $50.  today there's $50 hdtv media servers the size of a couple dvd cases that play ALL common file types. even the 720p mkv stuff. c'mon people. it won't hurt ya to get with the times.  and hey i bet once they compared some x264 videos to the same video in xvid they will see the difference and wonder why they weren't going with x264 sooner.  especially when the x264 can look just as good or better than xvid and be the same file size or smaller.  for example i have episodes of Ghostly Encounters; only 90-100mb an episode and looks like hd on the big tv! xvid would be almost twice that size and would be lucky to look as good.

p/s: rambo, fyi, i am still contributing, just not messing with torrents anymore. out of curiosity, what have you contributed? *checks your profile* oh. look at that. not a damn thing. figures. :)  after you've uploaded hundreds and hundreds of torrents then get back to me about that.

i know nobody else cares about what i say. they all know the beef is between pss and i. funny thing - the only person to tell me to shut up is you rambo while numerous people would tell him to shut up on my stuff.

now if you stfu i will as well. keep my name out your mouth and i'll do the same. deal? deal. :D"
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-11T21:24Z,"I gotta call you out on another lie.
This one is a major one.

You said:
""this source of this one looks like t-n-e as hes defaced it with a logo :) i didnt bother ridding it

but I didnt get it from his blog either..""

That's bullshit. You did get it from my blog. You're right about nobody leaking it. You stole it. You knew people were anxious for Destination Truth so you stole s05e02 cuz it wasn't anywhere else.

How do I know you stole it?  Check it out -

You were complaining about Haunted Highway missing the last 2 minutes and that's why you didn't release it. Come to find out the JumboFiles upload of mine got cut off a little short, gave me a download link anyway and thinking it was the full file I posted the download link in my blog. You downloaded that while snagging this episode of Destination Truth to re-convert it and re-release it all because your lying thieving ass wanted to look like a hero. 

You hate x264's especially mine yet you take them all the time to try and make yourself look better. YOU are the fucking cunt.  You bitch-ass motherfucking ungrateful cock gobbling ho.  

Rambo. Don't say a fucking word. We all know you're just psspss's butt buddy skank. "
,Charlie117,2012-07-12T00:06Z,Any chance for 720p?
[V],psspss,2012-07-12T03:05Z,"
compared to the source of haunted highway you relesased with the damaged ending I dont see how you can compare me to you
you had to release a new one.. so you clearly didnt check your own work by skimming like I do

Im not even going to bother reading you comments and insults

as for 2 pass if you want a fixed size then yes its good but when transcoding from mp4 over mp2s theres hardly much difference I bet you cant even point out a see-able difference
im not worried if the file is 20mb in size difference either way.

people can choose to either download my stuff or not.. at least i provicde to p2p"
[V],psspss,2012-07-12T03:40Z,"and i know no one here in fact.. I work alone and not even the same country and the only gay turd appears to be you and your mates spouting nonsense about stealing work
you come across as real bitches :)

if you dont provide on p2p then you next to useless and who wants you videos with defacing logos anyhow.. other cappers do better releases "

[V],psspss,2012-07-12T07:18Z,"im not sure why the 720p ep2 has not been added also by now but its been on news groups all day now

I wont be doing it though, guess you have to wait for someone to do it.. and been kind to up to p2p public

im happy as always with xvidss"
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T05:56Z,"also, i bought 3 panasonci dvrs cost about 800$ each 3 years ago.. hardly use them now but
no point in replacing them with some shit mp4 player but they play xvids perfectly
and unless you one foot away from the bigscreen you cant tell if its a mp4 or xvid in fact

distance always chances things

im sure others in same boat.. why replace perfectly good gear when it does the job"
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T06:00Z,"and again,.. I got sources direct from commercial place or second hand from other places..they would of taking and reupped else where

I dont even want your sources.. as they are damaged with logos"
,xpmule,2012-07-13T08:19Z,"you knew he was gonna bitch etc if you uploaded HIS video so I'm suprised you would bother..

and trialNerror
i've downloaded your videos before and they were great no complaints.
and i don't care what format is used i just want consistency for the season in question.

Also watermarks are pretty lame
sad you feel you need to do that :(

I hate it when people say i don't care where it came from i just want my crap etc
These people obviously havn't had their work ripped off.
As a cracker I've put up with a ton of this crap until i quit. I left a well known pc games group because of this attitude.

anyway i hope you two can get things figured out. You have both contributed to the community (world)

based on some comments on other torrents i could see this whole discussion coming lol"
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T09:20Z,"i didnt even notice it was from him.. not til I uploaded.and saw the defacing. but who gives a fook..i have never and never want to go to his blog why dont he rip xvid and upload himself. I only do it cos no one is adding to p2p community the xvids anymore.

other cappers do a better job even if they are 12 to 24 delayed.. still if afg dont do a xvid I  prob will
"
[V],psspss,2012-07-13T09:31Z,"the usa want to control the web but its public domain.. once its up on the web people will do what they want with it.. 

theres a difference it taking a program and
relabelling.. without any changes right and saying its yours but
if they totally rewrite it or make it better then
you shouldnt complain they used your work
most will say they use your code as a basis

i dont think you can compare program hacks with videos. though.. after all
tne rips a tv ts streams and makes a mp4

I find a video source most dont even have
ownership.. and convert to xvid.
as you well know I always put i converted BLAH mp4 or whatever to xvid.. it gets a bit lame after a while.. I just dont like tags in files names.. or logos.on the video it self

I hate when syfy have those big pop up logos at the bottom take over the video liek 1/3 screen"
