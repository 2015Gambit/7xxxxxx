There are basically two types of iPhone books out there: 
(1) The ΓÇ£tell-me-all-about-itΓÇ¥ kind, which includes in-depth discussions on everything from wireless network protocols to advanced compression codes. 
(2) Then thereΓÇÖs this book, which instead is a ΓÇ£show-me-how-to-do-itΓÇ¥ book that skips all the confusing techno-jargon and just tells you, in plain, simple English, exactly how to use the iPhone features you want to use most.
The iPhone Book is from Scott Kelby, the award-winning author of the smash bestseller, The iPod Book. Scott takes that same highly acclaimed, casual, straight-to-the-point concept and layout and brings it to learning AppleΓÇÖs amazing iPhone. Scott teams up once again with gadget guru and leading iPhone authority Terry White to put together a book that is an awful lot like the iPhone itselfΓÇôsimple to use and fun to learn. The bookΓÇÖs layout is brilliant, with each page covering just one single topic, so finding the information you need is quick and easy, with a large full-color photo on each page so you can see exactly how it works.
