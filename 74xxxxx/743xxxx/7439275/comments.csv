,logan-x-art,2012-07-20T07:06Z,"I own a Commodore 64, but dont get much use out of it, until your momma comes over and I fuck her in the ass with it laying on a shelf near by and she asks what it is that?...I say I got it from Vanderbilt..."

,amfg,2012-07-30T10:29Z,why there isn't s01e08 yet?
,waspo,2012-08-04T10:13Z,...cause episode 8 hasn't come to TV yet. Maybe in a few days. They must play and episode every few weeks or so instead of every week.
