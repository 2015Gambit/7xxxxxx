Episode No. 425 (or 200.5, revised)
"Understanding No Agenda"


[sebaygo1]


This episode was put together last weekend and contains a lot of episode no. 200.5 (from May 2012) plus some new material. 

It is essentially a show about the show.

The main reason this is running at this time is that Adam is getting married (in The Netherlands) on the 16th.
