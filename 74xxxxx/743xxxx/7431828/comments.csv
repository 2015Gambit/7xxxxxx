Great Job do not worry."
,donotcare,2012-07-11T17:19Z,you are the best. thank you so much for this. i cant wait til the new one comes out. the fact that you posted the other two in 1080 is AMAZING! is there a way you could do the scream franchise? that would be insanity!
,hdreyes,2012-07-11T22:56Z,"thank you very much for this and all of these great movies you've uploaded! Great work! A Skull is overdue!!

I would greatly appreciate it if you could finish the Pixar movie collection like Nemo. 

Thanks again and I am looking forward to all of your next ups.

Oh, and don't listen to donotcare! Scream movies are a wast of time! LOL"
,nero4,2012-07-12T23:30Z,"thank you so much iv been lookin for those movie for my iphone and there is nothing that can convert movie to this quality !
anyway thx again and hope you can upload Sucker Punch movie later :)"
,opmusic84,2012-07-12T23:57Z,thank you very much
,donotcare,2012-07-13T03:17Z,"hdreyes, nemo would be a waste of time as well because it hasn't come out on 1080p format. speak when you are spoken to little one. my request was made just like yours. no reason to put your two cents in at all."
[T],tr108,2012-07-14T00:02Z,"You're welcome guys. :)

@donotcare - Sorry, no Scream franchise. On the plus side, I've figured out how I'm going to do the step-by-step that a lot of folks ask for -- it should be ready in the middle of August -- so peeps can encode & tag for themselves.

@hdreyes - Finding Nemo releases on Blu-ray (the preferred source of my encodes) in December. When I cop the disc, I'll up it then.

@nero4 - Sorry, no Sucker Punch."
,mss12,2012-07-15T02:18Z,"Thank you so much! I love all of your torrents! If you are able to, could you upload 'Wanderlust' and 'Friends with Kids' in 1080p? It would be greatly appreciated =]"
,puma233,2012-07-15T21:57Z,"wow dude, your encoding is epic. at first glance i thought you were using a cracked iTunes store encryption files. if you're ""preferred source for your encodes""  is available for the indiana jones trilogy (notice how i said trilogy), then you should do 1080 rips. not too impressed with the 720s on here (or at least my copies anyway). if not, then it's all good. these rips are incredible. thanks so much!"
[T],tr108,2012-07-17T19:46Z,"Thanks for the compliments, guys.

@mss12 - sorry, neither title is likely.

@puma233 - lol @ trilogy. Yeah, the IJ trilogy is on my to-do list. It releases on BD in Sept, but who know when it'll get leaked online..."
,moeburn1,2012-07-22T17:19Z,Thank you for uploading what seems to be the only 1080 version of the Dark Knight with 5.1 audio!  I'm amazed that every other rip only has 2 channel stereo and yet people are complaining about 2 lines of pixels cut off the bottom of the screen...
,RadioActiveX,2012-07-23T15:57Z,"damn you beat me to it, TR108... I was going to upload this one and batman begins... Instead I uploaded Green Lantern 1080p

For those who enjoy TR108:
I'm going to be helping out and posting movies with his same qualities. Of movies I rip...

Green Lantern is Up here:

,nullsis,2012-07-24T05:10Z,"dude, your rips are flawless and of superb quality, but they don't work with iTunes Home Sharing, how come?

Reproduce:

I have a WHS, I added your video to iTunes on the server. I enable Home Sharing on both my iPad and iTunes on my server. Files from uploaders like HolyRoses work fine and play on my ipad from my server, but for some reason, even though your files add to itunes without a problem, they won't appear on my ipad."
,nullsis,2012-07-24T06:48Z,"im beginning to figure out why this is happening: your files have a 1080P video tag on them, as such, the ipad 2 won't support playback simply for this reason. This is a software-only limitation.

if you can show me how to change the Video Quality Tag on your files from High Definition 1080P to High Definition 720P, this would solve my problem..."
[T],tr108,2012-07-25T16:20Z,"@moeburn1 - you're welcome.

@RadioActiveX - I'm looking forward to more encodes from you :)

@nullsis - the iPad 2, if on iOS 5.1 (or later, as noted in this torrent's description), supports 1080p playback. If you can't/don't want to upgrade your iPad 2's software, I also post 720p versions of all of my 1080p films. (If you choose to download both, they will show up as a SINGLE entry in your movie library and iTunes will send the more compatible file to each device)

If you MUST alter the HD tag, try Subler (if you're on a Mac) or MetaX (if you're on Windows). I'm  skeptical that will solve your issue tho."
,nullsis,2012-07-27T04:31Z,"@tr108 - Thank you so much for reccomending metax. I know it sounds crazy, but altering that video quality tag to 720P on your 1080P files actually worked. I can now stream your 1080P files to my ipad 2 through iTunes home sharing. 

I know that the latest version of iOS 5 added the ability to play 1080P content on the ipad 2 natively, however, i think they missed adding the feature of playing 1080P content on the ipad 2 across a network through home sharing. oh well, this work-around is fast and easy, so long as metax stays around!

thanks again, and keep up the good work. I do have one issue though: I'm seeing this on multiple of your files, well, at least several of the 720P versions - a green, sometimes blue bar across the top of the video. I'm seeing this in multiple media players, including VLC. have you noticed this?"

[T],tr108,2012-07-27T09:30Z,"@nullsis - Your issues are generated by your setup, not by a limitation in iOS 5.

I can stream my 1080p encodes just fine to an iPad 2 with iOS 5.1 (tested on titles with only a 1080p encode in iTunes, to eliminate possibility of 720p encode being streamed instead; iPad 2 NOT jailbroken). If anything, iOS 5 brings serious updates to streaming non-DRM files. My iPhone 3GS -- a device that cannot sync with HD files -- actually streams 720p encodes from my iTunes library since it was updated to 5.1 (again, device NOT jailbroken). I'm an all Mac environment."
[T],tr108,2012-07-27T20:57Z,"@nullsis - looks like I'm due for a healthy serving of crow! I'm getting the honey mustard sauce out of the fridge...

My friend just admitted to me that the iPad 2 he brings over IS jailbroken. I suspect that makes a BIG difference with streaming capabilities. Apologies for the misinformation before."
,gusmento01,2012-07-28T21:51Z,"Thank you for the Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I really appreciate that, and I notice most of your encodes has Portuguese subtitles."
,mixania,2012-08-02T02:18Z,Awesome Bro! Don't know how to thank U!

are you going to be doing the pirates of the caribbean movies???? "
,red2silver,2012-09-02T21:36Z,"I know I should have read your notes, but I was disappointed that there was no IMAX footage.

In fact I have downloaded another one with IMAX footage but it had too much video noise.
The IMAX footage is so dramatic, I have loved it when I have seen that in an IMAX theater as well as on a projector. It might have been distracting on a small screen but when the screen is big enough the sheer drama conveyed by the wall of pixels is simply astounding"
