,BoonesFerry,2012-07-13T05:06Z,"I do appreciate when a 720p version is available...however, the quality of this 720p at 925 MB was not so good. So I downloaded the standard def Damages S05E01 AHDTV x264-MOMENTUM[ettv]  at 272 MB and played them side by side, at the same screen size, and could tell no difference. In this case, I would recommend the standard definition at 272 MB
