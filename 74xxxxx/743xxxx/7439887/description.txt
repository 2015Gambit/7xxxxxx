 ASAP isn't properly cropped at the top

 Also, check out the ivtc, it's so jerky. We've included
 2 samples encoded from ABC, the start of the show and
 a scene approximately 5 minutes in with the captain. In
 both instances ASAPs is overly jerky above and beyond the
 standard ABC framerape issues. Plus compare this to our
 overall encode from Global. It's clear that ASAP's
 ivtc needs some help. It's like someone is shaking the poor
 camera man on any sort of movement

 Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?
