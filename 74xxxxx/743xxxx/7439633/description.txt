Sometimes it is impossible to take a clear shot with no
over-illuminated and under-illumimated areas. IDRMyImage is the
solution to this problem.

Take several shots with different exposure times and fuse them
together using IDRMyImage.

It is easy and fast with natural looking results and a dynamic
range of tones. No artificial colors or structures are seen. In
the application you can easily adjust several parameters of the
fusion to get the best result.

From the technique it is obvious that the algorithm works best
on nearly static scenes. Moreover we strongly recommend using a
tripod while capturing source photos.

NOTE: For obvious reasons you should always make sure that
the title is restricted access to internet by a firewall
to avoid any problems. Further, when running our
keygens/patches you might need to run it with admin
rights while in Vista/Win7 to ensure that it has
enough privileges.
