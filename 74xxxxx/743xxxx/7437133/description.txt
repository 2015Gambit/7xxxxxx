Review by Scott Yanow:
This LP (which has been reissued on CD as part of Interchanges '54) introduced Paul Desmond's beautiful ballad "Audrey" and found the early Dave Brubeck quartet (with pianist Brubeck, altoist Desmond, bassist Bob Bates, and drummer Joe Dodge) making a rare studio recording; up to this point all of their most popular records were club performances. With fresh versions of such songs as "Jeepers Creepers," "Pennies From Heaven," and "A Fine Romance," this music is certainly worth acquiring.
