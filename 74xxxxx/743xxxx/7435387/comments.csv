Also I like Alpha Girl and I'm looking for the final issue of Infinite Vacation. If you happen to find them? Just asking, been looking for a bit now. Much thanks in advance if you find them."

Supurbia #3 and #4 I have held in my hands, but I dont have a scanner and no idea the settings - I love that series and no idea why no one has scanned the rest or how to request/contact any scanners like minutemen or DCP ???

I have never heard of Alpha Girl?"
