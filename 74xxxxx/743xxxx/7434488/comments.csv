,nbrazil,2012-07-11T20:28Z,Why is this zipped? Kind of redundant considering it is already RARed as a CBR file.
,LCSINpatria,2012-07-11T21:17Z,"just change the file extension to cbz, opens just fine with comicrack, and quit b!+ching, thx MM82"
,dbranson17,2012-07-12T04:32Z,"I appreciate your effort and long-time uploads, but this is messy.  This zip unpacks to a bunch of jpg's not a cbr..."
,Caf1000,2012-07-13T05:47Z,"Don't unpack the file, just rename it to .cbr, the file itself is fine, just the name is borked."
