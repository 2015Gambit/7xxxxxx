Skulltronics Codec Test Compilation (CTC)
==================================================

This is my Codec Test Compilation. It consists of
videos I collected over the time. If all the videos
are playing and Windows shows a thumbnail in the
explorer for every video then your codecs and
settings are working.

I think there is every container format with all
the codecs and audio codec combinations I can think
of.

If you wonder about some videos. They are there
because the where videos where i maybe had no
sound, thumbnail or other problems.
Well some are there because I like them.
2 Girls 1 Sub is definitely one of them :-)

Naming convention:

The files are sorted by codec until the files with
the prefix x, y and z. The prefixes are there to
combine different types of videos.

xSubCha: Different kinds of videos with subchapters.

yMTS: The official Matroska Test Suite. This files
      have errors but should play without crashing
      and to the end. There is a description for
      every video in the Matroska Test Suite.txt

z1-z14: This videos are the real deal. They are
        almost sorted by how much they push your
        hardware.
        z8 and z13 are the real CPU killer.
