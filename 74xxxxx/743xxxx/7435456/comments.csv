,bill.lupton,2012-07-13T19:44Z,"Great Copy! However, when burned onto disc and played in Blu-Ray player CinAvi was detected.  Bastards at the studios are getting clever.  Works on DVD players, tho. Thanks so much"

,Silverman84,2012-07-18T05:13Z,"Quality is fine for what it is. The movie really let me down though, I'm a huge fan of family guy etc. This just didn't do it for me."
,setzerfoxclaw,2012-07-19T05:38Z,"If you have a HDTV with USB ports, one thing you can do to bypass cinevia, is to put the movies on an external harddrive and connect that directly into the TV,  If you have any sort of Mediaplay software it should pop right up"
