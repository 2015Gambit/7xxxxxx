,bunnyhopkat,2012-07-13T02:29Z,"Anyone else get the pop up ""It looks like you have installed an unofficial game modification that does not match your current version of the sims 3"""
,bunnyhopkat,2012-07-13T02:29Z,The game then crashes if you click continue on the pop up.
,Rachouri,2012-07-14T12:57Z,"ok this torrent is working 100% like always with games 4 the world but i'm really diappointed by EA! Honestly, this stuff puck is so lame, the objects are like 10 maximum plus they're ugly!!!! So lame... EA, Supernatural must be better or else the fans might give up on you... :/"
,M1nt3a,2012-07-14T22:30Z,"Is it safe to update the game after installing this?

@bunnyhopkat: That is caused by out of date custom content. If you installed a core mod such as Awesomemod it will definitely be out of date once you install this stuff pack. Remove all game mods and see if you still get it. If not, try adding them back a few at a time til you get it again to figure out what custom content is borked."

,gazer101e,2012-07-22T06:38Z,"cant install it, ""this product requires an installed copy of The Sims 3. pls. install the sims 3 before installing this product""

that's what it's telling me...."
,freebird654321,2012-08-02T10:19Z,"@gazer101e, 

the answer is right in front of you. You need to have the original Sims 3 installed before you install any expansion or stuff packs because they all just add onto the original game. Just download the original, then install the Diesel stuff pack after. Also make sure you paste the crack (from the diesel stuff pack) into the original Sims 3 bin folder"
,Shibapup,2012-08-26T05:17Z,"I downloaded this torrent and it worked fine for a few days, then the unauthorized material warning came up. I downloaded the Ultimate Fix and copied the files into the correct game-bin. It still happens and my game interface says I'm up to date. What else can I do?"
,junipersunshine,2012-08-26T10:51Z,"Downloaded it, but it says I have to update it when I run the setup file, and it always tells me, ""Error with The Sims 3 update. Setup is unable to continue."" Can anyone help me? Thanks!"
,leanderwolters,2012-08-31T16:18Z,It says the disk is missing so when i try to place the crack in to the sims 3 bin file it says the disk is full. I mounted it with poweriso. Please help me so i can play it!
,entiu26,2012-09-04T13:30Z,"says:Please insert the sims 3 diesel stuff disc...
