PS
note! I will be cutting back.. had isp call today and they want to charge more and cut back the data at the same time which means I have less I can upload.. as i need it for downloading for myself.
basically $1 a gb.. uploads are part of the max 120gb
a month.. our country has the worse internet for price and data caps and speed is prob slowest about.
