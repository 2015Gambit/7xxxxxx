,Doomdesire,2012-07-30T11:33Z,"....IT WORKS PPL !!!  This is a legit file. Read the file extension. (.7z) That means u must unzip it using this mac software --- Ez7z ( go google it up). 

After unzipping it. This game, however will still not be able to run as the UE (Unix executable) file has been changed to a doc. Its quite simple to solve it. 

Step 1: Download this torrent and unzip with Ez7z
Step 2: Download the Monster RPG 2 lite from mac app store. Its free
Step 3: Right click on the Lite file then click 
>Show Package Contents>Contents>MacOS. 
Step4: U will see a file named ""Monster RPG 2 lite"". 
Step5: Copy that UE file
Step6: U can delete the Lite version app
Step7: like step 3, Right click on the full ver. file, 
>Show Package Contents>Contents>MacOS. 
Step 8: Paste the Ue file ""Monster RPG 2 lite"" inside.
Step 9: Open the file ""Monster RPG 2"" file with Text edit
Step 10: Copy all data in it. (Cmd A then Cmd C)
Step 11: Delete ""Monster RPG 2"" file
Step 12: Open ""Monster RPG 2 lite"" file with Text edit
Step 13: Delete all data in it and paste/ replace with earlier copied data
Step 14: Close it and rename ""Monster RPG 2 lite"" to ""Monster RPG 2""
Step 15: Voila! Launch n enjoy the game

O i forgot. If u r unable to change the data in the Ue/ doc files (e.g copying/pasting), select the files, get info, then unlock the file @ the bottom right.

Comment if this helps u. Feel free to ask anything :)"
