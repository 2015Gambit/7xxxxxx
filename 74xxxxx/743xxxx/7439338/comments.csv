It's not everyday AiR feels the need to comment on a release but we believe some issues about Markus Feil
need to  be addressed  for both legitimate users and the warez community. In our opinion Markus Feil's plugins are  

the equivilent to MALWARE, it is with disgust we find the  elaborate (and futile!) measures he has taken  within 

his code.  When a developer  starts dropping files  and creating empty BOGUS  registry keys,  writing to  a users 

host file etc.  then they  have crossed  a line  of ethics that is inexcusable. One  could  argue  that  warez  

users  get  what they deserve, however... warez uses ALWAYS choose to  take a risk  when  they use  warez.  The  

legitimate user however gets exactly the SAME codebase and IF  things go wrong they are subjected to the same 

MALWARE  crap undeservedly. Furthermore, our  release is  BETTER than  what legit users are  getting because  we 

have  disposed of  the MALWARE traps and HAVE  ENABLED TWO EXTRA NEW HIDDEN expansions that  legit users DON'T have 

and probably DON'T know about. NOTE  TO Markus:  you are  tool, ppl  may debate  our ethics but WE DON'T infect and 

manipulate filesystems or  registries, you're no better than a virus developer in our opinion.
Stick to what you know cause your protection  schemes are no match for us  Some warez users like to  

go legit, it's hard to  see them  going legit with your plugins when  the experience you give them results in piss 

poor MALWARE techniques. FUCK YOU! Here are some of the techniques Markus infects your machine with:
- Registry scanning - Filesystem scanning  - Creating bogus registry keys - File dropping - Multiple 

system32driversetchost file updates - Deletion of files - Phone home notification - ExitWindowsEx calls (causes 

machine to shutdown) - DLL unpacked checks # Registry scanning... Markus has coded his plugins to look for other  

Tone2 and reFX registry entries, if blacklisted serials are found then his MALWARE is invoked. These include
Firebird, FilterBank, Warmverb, Gladiator, Vanguard # Filesystem scanning... Markus  has  coded  his  plugins  to  

look  for other products keyfiles, if blacklisted keyfiles are  found then his MALWARE is invoked. This includes  

FireBird,FilterBank, Warmverb, Gladiator. Markus creates keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER at least two NEW keys with no 

data (not disclosing to protect privacy). if you  have been subjected to  the MALWARE traps check your registry, 

the keys will be obvious as the names are crap, make no sense and they have no data under them. # File dropping...  

-  Markus creates(VST plugin folder):twdef.sys, wvdriver.sys, r2._9X1.r, gldriver.sys, gsndrun.sys
+ about 4 other random file names (not disclosing to protect privacy) If your going to look  for these files make 

sure  you have  turned  off  'Hide  protected  operating system files' in explorer. Typically they are dropped in 

the same location as the Gladiator2 dll. # Update of hosts file...  Markus updates  the users  host file  with a  

massive list of warez, torrent and other site urls # Deletion of files... Markus  deletes  any  blacklisted  

keyfiles  from the 贸users machine."
,xside75,2012-07-22T10:53Z,"Gladiator to uninstall from the system and delete all traces as well.
Run any Registry cleaner / repair (eg: RegDoctor v2.31)
Restart machine and the problems disappear. There is no better idea, sorry!"
