LittleSnapper allows you to take screenshots of an entire webpage, or specific portions of your screen in general, without cluttering your desktop with a ton of icons. It then organizes those snaps into a library where you can tag, rate and comment them.

It also comes with some built-in vector tools that allow you to mark up your images with text, callouts, shapes, lines, arrows, blurs and highlighting. Best of all, the annotations are all non-destructive allowing you to hide and show them at a moment's notice.

Then share the snaps with your clients colleagues and friends. To make that possible, we've built in support for Flickr, image exports, FTP, SFTP and our own webservice especially for LittleSnapper users: QuickSnapper.
