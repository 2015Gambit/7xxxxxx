,greenRadar,2012-07-19T10:30Z,i downloaded the first Ep and seems that there's something wrong with the frame-rate even-though  vlc shows it to be 23.8 fps
,hakuna_matata,2012-07-26T16:58Z,"after ""Life"" ... Damian Lewis in a new TV Series.. have to get this one. Thanks a lot!"
,SirScoops,2012-08-19T22:15Z,"oh my GOD this show is so hilariously bad my roommates and I have to decide whether to get stoned and keep rewatching the first episode practically dying of laughter.. holy shit.. when the mom comes in like ""Kids I have something very important to say!!!"" and then she literally forgets and the 8 year old kids like ""uhh mom ... u had something important?"" practically assembled into his sister's room in some really awkward elementary school way omg the mom bless her heart she CANT ACT"
,SirScoops,2012-08-19T22:17Z,"HEY REPORTER SLUT!! WHATS THE POINT IN HIDING 1 PILL IN YOUR ADVIL BOX A DAY?

THAT MEANS U HIDE THE REST SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE HOUSE!
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? INCREASE THE CHANCES OF SOMEONE FINDING THE DRUG BY 100%???

A 2 YEAR OLD KNOWS BETTER


""uhh boss??? I ... felt a 'migraine' come on so i looked in her advil container and found this pill?""

,SirScoops,2012-08-19T22:18Z,this show is really really bad

,Ignignot78,2012-08-31T06:13Z,"Sirscoops sure does a fuckton of time on the comment section of a show he doesn't like, and basically talking to himself. This show is fucking fantastic. Brilliantly written and directed. Here's a list of the Awards this show has received:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1796960/awards

Beware the critique of a stoned moron."
,nyg0812,2012-09-08T20:07Z,"scoops you're a fucking idiot, just shut up. You give marijuana smokers everywhere a bad name. I've never watched this show but I am downloading this torrent because if anyone as stupid as you says its bad, it has to be good."
,bearock2,2012-09-14T04:29Z,this torrent is very quick to d/l...thanks to the uploader....my opinion after watching the first episode is this is a better show than most...not as good as the west wing...but very good at the intrigue and mindset of the subject...intelligence...hope they keep up the good work
,bearock2,2012-09-15T11:07Z,now after 10 episodes....this show DOES draw you in....and is multi-layered with plot and intrigue...VERY well written and acted...i can see at least another year and more if the writers keep putting it out like this year
,bearock2,2012-09-15T11:58Z,"according to wikipedia...the SECOND season premiers on 30 sep 12


just two weeks...YEA!!!!"
