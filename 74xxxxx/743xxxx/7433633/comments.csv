[V],psspss,2012-07-11T17:01Z,"i thought also the quality of this source was way better and cleaner then his.. and the volume didnt distort 

I do have haunted highway but its damage
so I will wait

I see HDH or killers are uploading 720p
rips of DT now so I suspect HW will be next
but its 3am so I prib go a bed so it have to wait til morning"
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T17:04Z,"yeh beats me why syfy just dont offer 20usd month
unlimited direct downloads.. 
fook expensive itunes shit. per episodes thats
too much and they slow to release to such site as well..

about time they learnt.. world wide direct downloading at reasonable prices they get plenty of funds and ratings..

as fans will support them direct..

tv and cable and pay tv or ads is old..

they need to embrace the way of the future
rid this shit aboutbeing usa only to watch etc"
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T17:08Z,"arr what did I say.. didnt take long for it to show on p2p from other places.. p2p always seems to be the last place it shows up.. cos the rippers
arent doing it

[V],psspss,2012-07-11T17:10Z,"thats if you like mkvs and wasting 1.5gb on one episodes.. thats like 4 normal xvid episodes :)

but thats the big screener and 720p wanting

although I find the xvids on our 44inch is pretty darn good.. but I stick to lappy on for watching way more comfy.. 1 foot away is like a bigscreen 4meters away anyhow :)"
