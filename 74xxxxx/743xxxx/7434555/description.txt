On a recent M2TS upload of John Carter there were a few complaints. If you're unaware of how best to play M2TS files (for example, if you don't have the equipment) then don't download this, or you'll just complain more.

For the people that do know about the M2TS format, I'm sure you'll appreciate they're a great compromise. Great picture quality and surround sound, all in a 4GB FAT32 compliant bun! Enjoy - and thanks to the encoder!
