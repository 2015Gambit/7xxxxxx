Here's a non-kiddie version of this game. Keep pirating this, this guy deserves no money for blatantly ripping his game off of Toady's. 

*Note; I hope you don't mind if I put this on your uploads of this game. I feel it's appropriate since Toady actually deserves money for his game, and he only asks for donations, while this -obvious- rip-off doesn't deserve any money being REQUIRED to take part in this awfully buggy beta.*"
,darktrogdor,2012-07-17T01:08Z,"""Boo hoo this game is too kiddy, its a rip off of dwarf fortress"" Who cares. The guy who made dwarf fortress is going to be fine with or without competition and if you love dwarf fortress so much then why the hell are you even bothering with this game.  Grow up.

And the game itself is fine. I do agree on one aspect though, Im not paying for this."
,Heliopios,2012-07-19T15:12Z,"I'm bothering because this game deserves no money and the main developer has stated Df is a main inspiration for this game; so if you have a problem with me pointing it out and trying to direct people to the actual, well made game that this is based off of then you can just go fuck off and shut up you leeching cunt."

If Gnomoria didn't exist I still wouldn't play DF, no matter how well made it is, I've tried, and tried again, the graphics just kill it for me. Not many alternatives other than Towns, and Gnomoria honestly beats the shit out of Towns.

Thanks for these uploads, looking forward to snatching the 8.5.1 when you get around to it :D"
