The good thing about this omission is that the thrill of digging correct answers in the back of the book and comparing it with your own is not gone, even amplified..."

[V],dynstab2,2012-07-13T15:36Z,"The description says: ""...(13 MB)...complete with table of contents, appendices and index. Quasi-native PDF quality.""

The descriptions say what about completeness and quality of the ""duplicated"" torrents? Nothing. So I had to download them to learn about their state... which I did before indexing mine even if I didn't have to given the 1:3 ratio in size, a clear advantage for users. [In fact I needed download only one since they both index the same textbook file]

Now you will tell us about the state of this textbook file you accuse me of duplicating, won't you? I won't laugh, I promise.


YOU, 594mgnav, are a repeat, outright and unrepenting duplicator of torrents here and on Demonoid, even doing your dirty deeds with loaded/infected files (to what purpose, ha?) or using my own files (branded with my username in several ways, making your denials look even more childish), files posted days, weeks, even months earlier.

Worse, YOU, 594mgnav, are an amateur."
