,Tired78,2012-09-02T02:42Z,"Thanks for the torrent. Is there anyone who could upload some of the newer books, though? I look for them all over the place but they're not anywhere. I'm specifically talking about:

Vampire Kingdoms: Expanded and Updated
Triax Two
Lemuria
Sourcebook One: Revised and Expanded
Shemarrian Nation

Also, could somebody please upload Pages 60-61 of POWERS UNLIMITED 3? Even if it was just a picture taken with an iPhone that'd be hugely appreciated."
,crackfiend76,2012-09-07T11:03Z,"Tired78 Are you having any luck getting ahold of the books on your list?  If so, get in touch with me (@gmail), I've been trying to find the same ones myself.

I'd also add:
The new version of After the Bomb,
the new version of Beyond the Supernatural,
Phaseworld Sourcebook Thundercould Galaxy
Armageddon Unlimited
and Heroes of the Megaverse"
