Episode 25 : Raiders of the Falklands War

In 1982, Britain found itself fighting a full-scale land, sea, and air war eight thousand miles away in the South Atlantic. The speed with which the British task force was able to reoccupy the Falkland Islands and defeat the Argentine invaders, was considerably helped by a series of daring raids mounted by the elite troops of the Special Air Service and Royal Marine Special Boat Squadron.
