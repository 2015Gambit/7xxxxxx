Eminem is mixed in with an acapella from ""Taking My Ball"" and the song ""313"" should be named ""Tonite"" and the song ""313"" should be named ""Tonite on Infinite. ""313"" is song nr. 4 and ""Tonite"" is song nr. 5 in the order. Just change their names and put em in that order and delete the song ""Like White Boys"" from Man in the Mirror and u are set for a correct and complete Eminem discography :)"
