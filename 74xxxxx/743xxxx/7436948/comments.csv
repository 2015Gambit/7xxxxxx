,khorven,2012-07-17T04:12Z,This torrent is shit. Part of a fight scene with the Lizard is cut and you don't see how it ends. Also there is a scene in the trailers that wasn't shown. The one where Peter is writing an equation on a blackboard in front of Dr. Connors. 
,LordCorwin,2012-07-17T11:10Z,"@khorven just fyi, just because something appears in a trailer for a film or show, does not mean it will ever show up.  I know this seems rather stupid, but for some bizarre reason, studios like to find the coolest little clips, cut them out of the film or show, and then use them as part of the ad campaign to get you hooked.  Occasionally these ""missing scenes"" get added back in during the ""uncut"" or ""director's cut"" versions.

Just saying, the scene you're looking for may not actually be in the movie.  Although there is a chance it could be as well."
,DarkVelox,2012-07-19T03:39Z,"@Khorven, the blackboard scene was only in the trailer. Wait for the DVD if you want to see that. As for the lizard part, I'll watch it for myself and see if it's really not there. The only reason I'm torrenting is because I'm in the middle of nowhere, lmao no theatres around here.

Anyways, will comment again after download.
