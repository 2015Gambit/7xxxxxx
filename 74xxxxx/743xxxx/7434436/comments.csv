,secd2e,2012-08-27T12:02Z,"@evil_toad ...why dont you download the torrent, and skip the files you dont want downloaded. just right click on the files you dont want"
,mars0124,2012-09-09T15:00Z,"@secd2e and anyone else interested:

The torrents are all compressed in a split RAR file, so you need to download all 2GB  to get one comic.

@Torrent Uploader:

Why would you compress CBR files as RARs?  They're already RAR files.  A CBR is just a .RAR containing JPGs thats been renamed to .CBR"
