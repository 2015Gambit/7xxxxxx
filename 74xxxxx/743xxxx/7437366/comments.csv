,nadroj321,2012-07-13T02:05Z,"As with every week sir, much appreciated =]

It's funny, Marvel's been talking a lot of crap about new 52 all year, but this week at SDCC marvel reconfirmed their new lineup coming out as ""Marvel Now"" and is a reboot of all of their main characters as well. Sauce http://insidepulse.com/2012/07/09/demythify-marvel-now-amazing-spider-man-movie-reboot-the-new-52-dc-comics-relaunch/

I like both of course, but DC has some truly wonderful writers on their team. I do like the avengers vs xmen line so far though, made to appeal to casuals for sure, but def worth a look. Just my opinion."

YOU ARE THE KING!!!
THANK YOU !!!"
,Bubbers83,2012-07-13T03:12Z,"Ok, so I'm confused. I been reading things on the internet about Marvel's new MarvelNow! initiative. Is it a reboot or just a drastic new direction for the same universe (as in the history of the universe is not changed). I've read articles about both so I'm confused. "
,Bubbers83,2012-07-13T04:16Z,there is a small problem...Swamp Thing 11 came out in LAST weeks batch of The New 52! releases. Just wondering if that was a mispost. Is there supposed to be another issue?
,Bubbers83,2012-07-13T04:20Z,nevermind. my bad. just looked at dc's site. I guess somehow that issue got leaked early on internet..DC only had 12 new 52 issues last week..and all the group postings had 13 with swamp thing. lol. Don't know how swamp thing 11 got leaked a week early but awesome!
,nadroj321,2012-07-13T05:18Z,"Marvel claimed it wasn't a reboot, but #1 issues of Thor, Iron Man, and most of their big name characters are coming out soon. All it's supposed to be is post AvX. How much it will affect canon and the marvel universe is still unknown. They can call it what they want, but looks like a reboot to me. That's not a bad thing if it is, I know it's a cautious subject but they should be more confident."
,surferlord,2012-07-13T10:01Z,Thank you Ichiro! :D
,twisted29,2012-07-13T16:54Z,Great as always! One question wasn't Swampthing in last weeks releases as well?
