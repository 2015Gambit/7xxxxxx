Have you encountered torrents from multiple websites giving you trouble just to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on your computer? Well i sure as shit have, and when you find one that isnt riddled with stupid ass ISO files, Passwords, or just disorganized bullshit sent straight to different places in your pc... They have THE stupidest god damn mods possible!

Not in this one son. In THIS torrent you have found the holy grail of San Andreas torrents, go ahead, ill give you some time to absorb the awesome might of it... Ok thats enough man.

Getting to the point --->
Grove St. is now replaced with Blue gang members known as Crips.

The Ballas are now replaced with Red gang members known as Bloods.

And the Los Vagos are still the same color, but are now replaced by the Latin Kings.

INSTRUCTIONS: ... There are no fuckin' instructions! Just extract and play! THATS IT!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWBIES SECTION:
If you dont know how to extract or what it means, just download WinRar if you do not have it on your pc. After installing it just right click the game you downloaded then click on Extract Here. (Or wherever you prefer your game to be at;)

And if you cannot figure out how to download anything from Torrent sites such as these, i would reccomend downloading Bittorrent. It pretty much is a program that lets you download any torrent.

Enjoy.
