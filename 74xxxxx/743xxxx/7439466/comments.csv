@ keeybee .... I took home both Peter Sellers from you, and seeded 
back totally 8.6 GB. Nice traffic on them both, and not just ""Nordic's"".  

It's amazing that you uploaded 7 or 8 movies in a row a while ago, and i already 
had them all ... ( I started to believe that we have the same movie-storage ....)

Mostly rainy days here .... I have no idea what's going on this summer .... 
Lucky that we have fellows like Keeybee, Scratzz, Auge, Ibrahimovic, 
Peter Sellers, etc .... Makes it more fun ( LOL ) !

/ Over and out !"

I don't know where you live but it could be next door, at least weather like. Well, the last days has actually deserved to be called summerdays."
