From Wiki:

Barenaked Ladies (often abbreviated BNL or occasionally BnL) is a Canadian alternative rock band. The band is currently composed of Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, Ed Robertson, and Tyler Stewart. Barenaked Ladies formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, then a suburban municipality outside the City of Toronto.[1] They are best known for their hit singles, "One Week", "The Old Apartment", "Pinch Me", "If I Had $1000000", "Brian Wilson";[1] as well as the theme for the sitcom The Big Bang Theory. They even did a theme song for the 2000 children's program Seven Little Monsters. They have won multiple Juno Awards and have been nominated for Grammy Awards. They are also known for their light-hearted, comedic performance style. Their live shows are known for humorous banter between songs and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at virtually every concert.[2] Original keyboardist Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995, and founding member Steven Page departed in 2009. They have sold over 15 million records including albums and singles.
