Fire Storm Over Dresden (1990)

77 min. NTSC, decrpyted original quality documentary DVD.

On the night of February 13th, 1945, there began one of the most controversial raids of World War 2 -- the bombing of Dresden. It is a controversy which still rages today. This documentary, taking into account the latest historical evidence, attempts to shed new light on this event.

Contemporary witnesses, previously unheard, describe the events and the terror of what is was like to be in Dresden through the night of bombing.

The film combines archive images of pre-war Dresden, with a night of remembrance 45 years later, in the Palace of Culture. Using information from Winston Churchill's diaries, the outspoken historian David Irving painted a comprehensive picture of the time, the backround to the bombing, and the strategies employed.

Above all, this film was made as a memorial to the loss of human life, and of great works of art, and as a warning of the future. It is a demand for peace, and a plea for humanity.
