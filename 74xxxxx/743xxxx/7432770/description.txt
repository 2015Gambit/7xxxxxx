Interestingly, gene synthesis is something that can be practiced with instruments found in virtually any molecular biology laboratory. It does not require multi-million dollar clean rooms or other specialized facilities. Yet most gene synthesis users tend to outsource this step to a few companies who specialize in providing these services. ΓÇ£The goal of this volume is help people better understand the different technologies that make gene synthesis possibleΓÇ¥ said Jean Peccoud. ΓÇ£It provides the tools to implement gene synthesis in house. It also gives users of commercial services a better understanding of the technology, its possibilities, and limitations.ΓÇ¥
