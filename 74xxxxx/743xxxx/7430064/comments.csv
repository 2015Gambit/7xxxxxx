,Doomdesire,2012-08-12T11:49Z,"It works. But u need two unzip 3 times.....
Worth the trouble though :)

warning (2nd unzipping step has 5 parts)"
,Doomdesire,2012-08-12T12:02Z,"@ the 2 above me. Its rather simple. Files are weird as the uploader is maybe joking with us or just wanted to lessen the file size.

Step 1- Unzip it. Folder shows 5 zipped files
Step 2- unzip all those files 1 by 1.
Step 3- U have 5 folders. open them 1 at a time and drag the .rar files to desktop or into a new folder
Step 4- Open/Unrar (nyan_cat_lost_in_space_v3.0.part1). Make sure that all subsequent parts are together.
Step5- u get another zip. Unzip it.
Voila- there's the game!

P.s. u can unrar using free apps like Ez7z or UnrarX"
