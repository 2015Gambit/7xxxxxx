If so I agree.... got the same 120 GB here... if you wait and stack up your dloads and pause them and let them all rip in the last 2 days of your monthly broadband it won't slow down to dial up speed like it is meant to... meaning you can literally get another 100 GB out of your monthly allowed 120 (total 220++) at normal speed, beats having the plan where u pay for each GB over you allowed amount. That last 2 days full on dload thing really works great it's all about planning... lol. Cheers for the file."
