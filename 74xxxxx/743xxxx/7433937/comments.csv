I think this was the most funny one yet.. they should turn this into
a reg soap series
Im surprised so few  download it..like about 150.. its pretty good
even for a religo show :)

but it does show how controlled the females are,,, Im surprise more dont
leave the cult for the real world :)

its funny how they do see how strange they look and clothes they self make
are.. pretty sad really.. considering the guys wear normal clothes pretty much.. even if its checkered bushmen shirts :)

if religion is so strong why does it need fear and out-casting and controls
in place... if people are happy in a place and want to believe in such things as god etc they never leave after all.
same with the Amish out of control show.. the leave for the same reasons
of being controlled and smothered"
