EZB.Systems-UltraISO-Premium.Edition-v9.5.3.2855-&-Keygen-CORE

Awesome program, my favorite of this type and the added iso emulator (fake cd/dvd drive) for mounting disc image files is really cool !
It is safer to use than daemontools and installs and uninstalls Very easily.
Unless you are mounting special disc images (usualy to emulate copy protection) UltraIso's disc image loader does the job just fine with out all kinds of over complicated crap (daemontools)
Also since before vista came out i switched to using this to burn ANY kind of cd/dvd rather than using something huge and over complicated like nero. This can use other cd burning engines (Nero) but has its own built in. So you can run this on any version of windows and burns discs with it ..ANY kind of disc you want.

Burning on the fly works great. In other words you can drag some files in the window and change the disc name and click on the cd type and change to the disc size you want and click burn.
Or you can use the tools menu to select burn cd/dvd image or MAKE cd/dvd image in TONS of formats.

Jeez i think i might go and by this damn program right now LOL
I hope you guys liked my review here ;)"
