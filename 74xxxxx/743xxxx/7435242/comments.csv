,almostD,2012-07-12T04:21Z,"There's two files in this torrent. One has to overwrite the element.aex file the other has to be selected anytime you start element in a new session of After Effects. Just select the ""a.license"" file and whait a second or two. Now you can use the Scene Setup button in Element. Have fun until the cracks arrives."
,goku242,2012-07-12T04:50Z,why do after effects keep crashing

,mkevic123,2012-07-12T14:48Z,"Lesten to me guys, i just solved a problem
1 Click on scene set up
2 Click on the last button (not on ''cancle button'')
3 Now select licence file from this torrent (white         one) and than click open

It works for me :)"
,Frankfox,2012-07-12T17:24Z,"first to all, thank a lot for share this program!!!
but...
I have a different problem. well
I install the plug-in
overwrite the element.aex file 
and also do the licence thing

licence looks fine, even I can choose a 3d object but the problem is when I click OK, in the composition nothing happen is all blank
Is anybody have the same problem?"
,citizins,2012-07-12T17:41Z,"Yes I am having the same problem. I downloaded element 3D from the other torrent, and then this torrent and everything works fine until i hit OK. once i hit ok in the element 3D scene, nothing happens, no 3D model gets imported into my scene. does anyone know how to fix this?"
,citizins,2012-07-12T18:03Z,"I am having the same problem, once i hit okay it doesnt load into my comp. whats going on? "
,Frankfox,2012-07-12T19:08Z,"the question is, if this problem is about is a pirate o a compatibility thing?"
,Frankfox,2012-07-12T19:10Z,"A Twett  from Andrew Kramer:

,almostD,2012-07-12T19:57Z,"Read the name of this torrent before asking....

Element3D (Scene Setup Crack No Render Yet) 

NO RENDER YET means you can't see it in the comp, but you can do anything inside the scene setup, try models and play with what's already there.

Using the Pro Shaders package you can recreate the shaders manually once at a time. Just duplicate a shader, rename it and select three files (diffusion, specular and normal). Save it and click on the pro shader folder. Click on the litte arrow and you should see a second folder. Your new material is there.
Now do it for all the shaders.... :-) or whait for the crack...

cheers"
,zaqz,2012-07-12T21:32Z,"the crack scene seems to be x64, mine is 32 and its not showing up in after effects..... 
"
,zaqz,2012-07-12T21:36Z,32 bit CRACK please
,goku242,2012-07-13T05:06Z,i fucking fixed the problem OMG its awesome and fast all you have to do is update your drivers
,zaqz,2012-07-13T06:01Z,"the crack is a SCAM, i open the license file in notepad and ... it contains this   NO SCENE RENDER

not a license 

"
,telephone345,2012-07-13T11:03Z,"Hey, I have CS4, and this ""crack"" doesn't work for me :(( ZAQZ i agree with you... i did the same, opened a.license file and there was written: RENDER NOT WORK :(("
,almostD,2012-07-13T17:23Z,"They modified the plugin to run with any license but you need one (even if it's fake). Follow the directions. We are on the same boat as you untill somebody releases a fully working crack.

And I asked Andrew Kramer, he said, Element3D is for 32bit too.."
