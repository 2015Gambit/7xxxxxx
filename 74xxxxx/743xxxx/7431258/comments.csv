[T],MrUnpopular,2012-07-11T16:07Z,"smileytv isn't even seeding…please seed this ffs, there's no way we can get the episode if there are no seeders."
,upx3,2012-07-13T07:26Z,"It seems like we're getting punk'd -- NONE of smileytv's torrents are seeded -- especially the 16 ginormous Hollywood Heights episodes !
smileytv -- maybe you can focus on ONE torrent at a time -- say HH.s01.e09 ? -- until it's fully seeded, then move on to the next one ??"
,upx3,2012-07-13T07:29Z,"ANYONE: If you find Hollywood Heights s01e09 - s01e16+, Please Let the rest of us know with a comment here !"
,upx3,2012-07-15T05:52Z,"FYI: The four most recently aired full episodes can be streamed from, http://www.nickatnite.com/videos/hollywood-heights-videos/"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-07-17T20:59Z,"^^ that's US only

they're on demonoid to download, you just need an account."
,upx3,2012-07-20T07:56Z,"THANKS MrUnpopular !
I have an account at Demonoid -- ALL the episodes are available there (since 7/15) -- Only 350 MB Xvid, perfect for me in this case."
,upx3,2012-07-30T18:35Z,"Demonoid's been down for 5 days, and may be down for quite a while longer  :-(
Does anyone have Demonoid's Hollywood Heights .torrent files ?"
,upx3,2012-08-11T05:30Z,"FYI: e01 - e34 pack is available on extra t0rrent and is0 hunt. Unfortunately, e04 - e22 are incomplete at the moment.
PS - Can anyone ""scrape"" it from there to TPB ?"
,Erik_O,2012-08-17T15:26Z,"thanks for trying, but can you seed too?"
