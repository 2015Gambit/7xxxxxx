Great torrent, good download, will be getting a seed from me!"

I took the time and risk to register on this site to inform everyone that this download contains a horrible virus.  When you mount the iso file, you will find a file ""sims3sp07setup.exe"".  If you have a good antivviurs it will detect a Trojan in this file.  On my system AVG detected Trojan Horse  Dropper Generic.  I noticed that the icon was not the Green EA plumbob but an unfamiliar  generic icon.  I did a little research and found that a lot of people had the same problem.  Check this link.  http://r.virscan.org/49cf51a0ce059bc3b0abd5339f05e285.  If you don't have a antivirus problem, then you are in real trouble!  I don't know whether anyone is dl'ing this anymore but if so, save yourself a little time and trouble."
