About:

Professional software for editing, processing and creating sounds for the simulator.
I did my own editing of an airplane engine sound and added bass effect and it sounds better.
The software is easy to use and it allows to hear the sounds of the aircraft without running the simulator.
Please refer to FS Sound Studio Manual.pdf for using the software.
The results of this program are very good.
Not tested with FSX, apparently it does not work with this version and that the only version in the meantime.
