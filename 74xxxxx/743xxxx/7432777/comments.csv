[V],psspss,2012-07-11T08:43Z,"nah nice thought but since p2p is illegal only private trackers dare to cash in on it..

I gad tio seed this to 1.6 before it seeded out too
normally its about 1.2 if people play fair

obviously they didnt give a fook.. so everyone lost out as utorrent auto pauses at a certain ratio until I over ride it

its seeded out now though.. "
[V],psspss,2012-07-11T08:44Z,i mean had to.. not gah :/
,anontrade,2012-07-11T09:27Z,"Thank for this new episode i love this tv show . 

I had the same problem then you . My provider dont give lot of bandwith and its pricy to add more. 
as everyone i like to share that's why i got a seedbox . Its super simple its a torrent client that run on a server . I pay 15$ per year for it about 2$ a month . my seedbox isnt really powerfull but have a lot of bandwith for cheap ! here's the spec 

Rutorrent
128/256 ram
1000gb bandwith 
10gb disk . 
i can run up to 10 -12 torrent seeding 
i limit download to 1 at time coz low ram to limit crash 


So when i want to download something i add it on the seedbox with the web interface . once downloaded i get it with a ftp client . so i can let the torrent seed on the server and i will be billed by isp only for the download so 174mb for this torrent 
 Same thing for upload you send file to seedbox with ftp than you create the torrent like you would do normaly and you can set it to 100x ratio without headech hehe =)

also ftp download/upload is usualy fast 

so to make it short you should get a decent vps that allow torrent at 5-10$ with 512ram and lot of bandwith and it will save you lot of $$ on local isp

look at http://www.wjunction.com/46-vps 
or ask for some tips here ill bookmark the torrent for couple day 

Hope it helped

[V],psspss,2012-07-11T09:35Z,"but seedbox is pointless.. I still would have to upload to it.. at more cost.. 
then I also would have to download via ftp etc
to get to watch as well.. so no gain either way

only benefit is the seedbox could seed it super fast once on there but ftp upload is still slow at 100kb.s "
