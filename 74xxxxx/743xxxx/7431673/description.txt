Known for voicing the role of Randall the zombie on the animated hit "Ugly Americans," Kurt Metzger steps out from behind the drawings to deliver one of the funniest hours of stand-up heard in a long time. Metzger's "Talks to Young People About Sex" digital album will be released on COMEDY CENTRAL Records on Tuesday, June 28.

In this hour set taped at Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia, Metzger explains the difference between Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs, why God could be a woman and the reasons we should forgive Tiger Woods.

Formerly a Christian minister, Metzger found himself more at home in the comedy clubs of New York City than in the cloth, and soon logged many appearances on COMEDY CENTRAL as a stand-up and as a writer for "Chapelle's Show." Other credits include performing on COMEDY CENTRAL's “Live at Gotham,” Showtime's “White Boys in the Hood” and as a regular on VH1's “Best Week Ever.” Metzger filmed a half-hour special for COMEDY CENTRAL and appeared on “Important Things with Demetri Martin and IFC's “Z-Rock.” In 2007, he was the stand out comedian at the Montreal Comedy Festival's New Faces showcase. He has also written for other Spike TV, VH1 and COMEDYCENTRAL programs.
