,alexpsilos07,2012-07-10T15:42Z,you can also convert to mp3 if you want and you are done!
,ComicsPlus,2012-07-10T16:00Z,"Yeah, it's legit.  (Always be suspicious of RARs on Torrent, but in this case it's cool.)"
,tayinlimbo,2012-07-10T17:52Z,So rookie question but can anyone tell me how to open this up in iTunes on a mac. It does not want to open .aac files
,alexpsilos07,2012-07-10T19:00Z,@ tayinlimbo you must find an aac to mp3 converter and then you can transfer the mp3 files to itunes.i 've done it already and it works fine.
,ComicsPlus,2012-07-10T19:27Z,"@ tayinlimbo 

Yeah, like the last poster said, you can convert them.  For conversion, I would recommend the open-source program Audacity.  (You have to make sure to also download the FFMPEG codec for it.  All of this would take less than 15 minutes of effort.)

Alternately, you can just use another type of media player which can read AAC.  I believe that VLC (also free and open source) or Windows Media Player Classic (ditto) should do the trick."
,kingjames219,2012-07-23T06:01Z,yeah im a rookie with these files and dont know how to convert them
