re:

In this unique approach to scepticism regarding God, Harrison concisely presents fifty commonly heard reasons people often give for believing in a God and then he raises legitimate questions regarding these reasons, showing in each case that there is much room for doubt.

The author shows that, despite the prevalence of belief in God or religious belief in intelligent people, in the end there are no unassailable reasons for believing in a God.

Really? Which god? Does this apply to leprechauns and gnomes and unicorns too?

Gods are *purported* beings with no evidence. One must provide evidence to prove one exists. Not believing in one is the default position. "

Its so simple to prove the God is truly exist..

There is a computer, it is so technological advance, the creator is man. It is impossible a PC exist without the maker: Human.

There is biological being: Human include, it is biologically more advance than any PC. The creator is God. It is impossible a Human that more advance than PC exits without the maker: God.

Question: where is God now? 
Answer: God is just too almighty to meet you little hunams, wait till you dead and face your judgement...  

You atheist dare say there is no God? I`ll will laugh if you dead and face your ""God"" that you denied, what kind of punishment you`ll get. "

This book peeps into minds of believers, tries to seek answer beyond their fear , arrogance and confidence.It is backed with third party archeological , paleontological and philosophical sources.It recommends very interesting books at the end of every chapter.All in all it's a good read.
