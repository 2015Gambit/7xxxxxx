     The 100 metre sprint final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics was the fastest
 and dirtiest race in history. Six of the eight runners have since tested
 positive for banned substances. Ben Johnson, the winner, received
 a career destroying ban, whilst his rival, Carl Lewis, had failed three 
 drug tests prior to the competition, and British runner Linford Christie, 
 who finished second, was eventually banned for a series of drug test 
 failures. In this program, Johnson and other runners will tell their
 personal stories of the race, and also put into context how and why
 athletes become drug cheats.
