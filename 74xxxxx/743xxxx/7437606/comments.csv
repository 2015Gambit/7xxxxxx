,ravinglunatic23,2012-07-15T03:47Z,How did you manage to get the game down to 2.67 GB? Last I knew it was around 5.12 GB. Did you compress it? Thanks.
,kdog0598,2012-07-17T06:20Z,is it not possible to install mods?
,NoQuints,2012-07-17T19:28Z,"Just finished installing it. Installation takes awhile but it works. It's the current version (1.6.89.0). Thanks to KaOs and gansuk.

Thank you very much i probably would have never figured that out and given up.

If anyone else reads that post the skyrimpref.ini is in two spots they tell u where on page 2"
,Andykings,2012-07-18T10:12Z,Wow awesome torrent. Thank you a thousand times!

Thanks."
,Dementia1369,2012-07-19T03:18Z,"I'm having some issues. The game installed fine, and I can get it started and everything, but when I actually start to play it it gets completely fucked up, even on the lowest quality. The audio works fine, as does the loading screen, and the pause menu, subtitles, and main titles (though the main titles lag a bit). The only problem is that the graphics seem to be really laggy or something. It just goes through random large shapes that are different colours (probably matching what's supposed to be there) while occasionally giving me a glimps of what's actually going on. Here's a couple pictures so you can see what I mean: http://imgur.com/a/cMWGh The first one shows what I meant by the different large shapes that flash around on the screen. Any advice on how I could get it to work properly? Thanks."
,thanosalimos,2012-07-19T03:43Z,i havent faced any issues yet. the only bad thing is that it takes a while to open and let me start the game
,polishboy1098,2012-07-19T20:33Z,"when I tried installing I got this error ""an error appears while unpacking rar archive.-- 12"""
,jbaer,2012-07-20T12:00Z,"Mounted combat didn't work! I tried fresh installation:
-deinstall current Skyrim 
-remove all Skyrim.ini, Skyrimprefs.ini from:
--C:Users""user name""DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim
--C:Users""user name""AppDataLocalSkyrim
--C:Program FilesSkyrim folder
and it  still not work...
Saw that it is 8GB installed, while BlackBox version takes 5GB...strange"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-07-20T17:51Z,"@ jbaer

The blackbox version is much larger in size. Moreover, it has some sound issues and to correct the sound issues you need to download a fix of more than 500MB what makes the download even bigger. I guess the issue might have been caused by your savegame?"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-07-20T18:02Z,"@ polishboy1098

Make sure u disable ur AV and close all programs while installing. Moreover, there should also be minimum space in ur harddisk for the extraction. Keep these in mind and re-install it :)"
,kingjalen01,2012-07-22T02:30Z,Hey Thanks For The Torrent The Game Works Awesome But I Have A Graphics Problem...When I Play The Game I See All The People Objects And Shapes Look Like What Dementia1369 Explained Can You Please Help Me With This Problem Thanks

,ibutton77,2012-08-02T07:28Z,"Just reporting in; file d3drm.dll is reported by malwarebytes as ""Malware.Packer.Gen"", and shows on virustotal as one hit from McAfee-GW-Edition ""Heuristic.LooksLike.Win32.Suspicious.C"". Report visible here: https://www.virustotal.com/file/68981be186af3746af6a027b93f503af0d8cbfbf14d6b996136ffcd2f71cce6e/analysis/

Inside the rar, unpak.dll (aka unpak.exe) has two near miss detections: https://www.virustotal.com/file/b2cc01a80a6a97348c97b9e945e5bf82a533456df434d34d1e9ffed097dcd39d/analysis/

Is this part of the way to dodge the DRM? Why is everything hidden in packed archives you have to start running exe's before you can get a clean scan on? I scanned everything I could unpack by hand, but I cannot determine if what's left is clean without turning over control to an executable. I'm just curious why it's set up that way. :/"

Any help???"
,FureeTutawk,2012-08-23T23:43Z,"Thanks for the upload, I've been through several and your group seems to have a better package. I appreciate the instructions, and the easy install.exe included. I appreciate the troubleshooting guide. Unlike a lot of others I've found around here, I think KaosKrew's version would have worked but... I won't know because after all was said and done, the game couldn't play because ""Failed to initialize renderer. ShaderModel3 required but not supported by your video card"" This isn't your fault. But the minimum requirement found in the readme,txt found after downloading sure seemed it would be fine. I wonder, would it be possible to make a little additional program with your games that we could run first to make sure all required components meet minimum needs? I would still have had to download the torrent, but at least I could have saved myself the long installation and the fast heartbeat thrill of seeing it loading without missing files or requiring more redistribution packs on top of the up to date ones already installed, like some others, lol. People are awfully angry with these games, the downloads and frustrations, and perhaps such a tiny little program designed to read what should be there once it is all installed would help prevent a lot of this. Kudos, I'm saving the file for when I get my good video card retrieved from my other computer."
,FureeTutawk,2012-08-24T00:02Z,"Here, I have some information for everyone who might want to avoid my heartache, which I found at a blog. Even after getting all to install and work without missing files or registry problems, I had a failure to initialize renderer due to my video card not supporting ShaderModel3:

""The ATI Radeon x800, x600, etc don't support SM3. The 6600, 6800, etc from Nvidia do, but their ATI counterparts didn't. Support didn't come until the x1xxx series, so the x1600, x1650, x1800, etc. Additionally I think there were a few odd ball cards that didn't, like the x1550.""

This means 1550 won't work, and it seems to mean 1000+ will work but for the few oddballs like 1550, but.. it also specifies 1600+ so it is possible that only 1600+ will work, but this person may have just been giving examples of 4 digits model numbers at random.

Mine is 1150, so it's in the 1000+ series, but might be one of those oddballs mentioned.  And I am upset because it is a refurbished computer I just bought 2 months ago which was touted as having a great integrated video card (given that integrated is usually bad) and should meet MOST current gaming needs!! But obviously it does not."
,DarkReisei,2012-08-24T00:46Z,"After the installer tells me to hit any key, nothing happens at all, I can't run the program no error messages nothing, I also don't have a skyrim launcher icon, so I don't know about this but it's not working for me at all."

,n2opurge,2012-09-04T21:16Z,Hey what does KaOsDI.exe do? 'cause my antivirus removed it
[V],gansuk,2012-09-12T01:18Z,kaosdi.exe is a rebuild tool what puts the game sound effects back into the game. without this tool doing its job the game will either not start or you will be missing sound effects.
,Radnarock,2012-09-18T17:01Z,"Gansuk. Thank You Very Much For The Upload But I Would Like To Ask Two Questions.

First. Any Idea Why Mounted Combat Doesn't Work And How To Fix It?.

Second. Can You Manage To Upload The Expainsion Packs Or Are They Included?."
