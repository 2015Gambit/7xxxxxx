  Notes:

  If The Launcher Fails To Start The Game The Reg Entries Have
  Been Blocked, Try Adding It Yourself By Clicking KaOs.reg
  Located In The Extras Folder.

  (Includes Reloadeds Update 9)
  We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe
  Default) As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain
  Games During Rebuild.
  Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe
  Creates Is C:/Games/
  This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe.
  If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone.
  Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming.
  (So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
