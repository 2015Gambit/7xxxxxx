Nature's Power Revealed
We can't control them, we can't accurately predict them, and they can produce some of our biggest tragedies, but nature's awesome powers have also shaped Earth, replenishing and renewing it every day. From the molten core of our planet to the protective embrace of our atmosphere and the water which supports all life, watch as we reveal nature's greatest powers.




2)  The Power of Water 
We are fascinated by its beauty, and its ability to refresh both us and our landscapes. But water can be one of the most powerful forces in nature - it brings the gift of life but it can cause death and great destruction. See how only six inches of rushing water is strong enough to move a car. Be there as a tsunami surges onto shore and reveals why it is one of nature's deadliest powers. Discover how in only twenty-four hours a giant flood reshaped the North American landscape. And marvel at how water created fabulous, giant crystals in a cave so huge a jumbo jet could fly through it.
