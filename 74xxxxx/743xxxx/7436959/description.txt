* Based on Shinohara Kenta's Sket Dance school comedy manga serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump.

The Sket Team is a school club whose self-proclaimed mission is to help people. It's members are Bossun, the leader; Himeko, the blond girl with a kansai-accent; and bespectacled Switch, intellectual otaku. No matter what your problem may be, they will do their best to help you.

On paper, this sounds cool but the reality is that they usually just laze away in their clubroom. The occasional requests that they do receive are usually trivial matters such as searching for lost objects.
