,Vikingman1111,2012-07-13T18:20Z,"Interesting, however. . . The photography is crude and lacks skill, but considering the rare footage this represents, worthwhile watching at least once. Just looking at the mostly young white fans in the early 70s is a gas, and the marches and interviews are hippie-like quirky and foggy. Want to study Hendrix's guitar technique from this film--forget it. Watch Stevie Ray Vaughn's videos instead. But, to understand where Stevie Ray got his inspiration and own technique; this one presents the one and only source--check out  Voodoo Child at the end and compare with Stevie's version (much more polished, but just as driven and skillful in its own way). Film is a very mixed bag."
