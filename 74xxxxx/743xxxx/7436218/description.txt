Nature's Power Revealed
We can't control them, we can't accurately predict them, and they can produce some of our biggest tragedies, but nature's awesome powers have also shaped Earth, replenishing and renewing it every day. From the molten core of our planet to the protective embrace of our atmosphere and the water which supports all life, watch as we reveal nature's greatest powers.



3)  Restless Atmosphere 
Fuelled by the sun, driven by the cycle of water and ocean currents, our atmosphere's behaviour is more powerful, more unstable, and more unpredictable than any other of nature's powers. Discover how the atmosphere protects us. Marvel at how hurricanes and tornadoes grow to catastrophic size and force. See the giant lightning strikes that discharge high above storms. And find out how meteorites could dramatically affect all life on Earth.
