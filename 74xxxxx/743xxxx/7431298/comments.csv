[V],Nepotu,2012-07-12T18:03Z,"Well, I don't want to spoil the quality of the videos. I think that if you want smaller filesize you can do it yourself after DL. Sorry, but one of you wants quality, other wants smaller filesize, other wants avi, no mkv... I can't do it in all ways possible. I hope you'll understand me! Cheers, bro!"
