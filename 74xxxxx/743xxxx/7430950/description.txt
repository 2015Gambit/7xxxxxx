Description
Race around the world doing burnouts, destroying stuff and drifting like a pro. RPM: Gymkhana Racing is an Acrobatic Racing game inspired by the gymkhana motorsport.

FeaturesUSE YOUR DRIVING SKILLS IN AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY
RPM focuses heavily on drift control, near misses (or hits) and the ability to deal with multiple curves and chicanes in one fast, controlled swipe. Losing grip and wiping out is your only adversary here.

LEAVE TIRE TRACKS ALL OVER THE GLOBE
Zip around 5 fully detailed environments like New York, Dubai, Rural China, Tokyo and Paris.

25 UNIQUE TRACKS
Race around 25 courses filled with obstacles and detail. Drift around the cramped training tracks of Japan all the way to the gigantic courses of the Louvre Museum.

MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES PER TRACK
Smash priceless art, do burnouts around meditating monks, splatter walls with paint, pose for the cameras and lots more. Each contains up to 7 objectives.

NON-LINEAR RACING
There is a start and a finish to every race, but it's up to the player to explore the tracks and find how to accomplish each goal. Going straight ahead is almost never the best way in RPM.

HD READY
RPM: Gymkhana Racing is fully optimized to show off the full potential of the newest iOS hardware.
