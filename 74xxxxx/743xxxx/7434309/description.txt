Zumas Revenge XBLA XBOX360-MoNGoLS

After more than six years, one of the Xbox 360's first XBLA games, Zuma, is finally 
getting a sequel. Well, to be more accurate, Zuma's Revenge came out in 2009, but 
PopCap is finally bringing the puzzler to Xbox Live Arcade this summer. The sequel 
will bring with it several new additions exclusive to XBLA, including a Boss Rush 
mode, weekly challenges and "an all-new player progression system via Spirit Animal 
companions." The game is slated to arrive on XBLA this summer for 800 MS Points 
($10), with a retail edition coming to North America at a later date.

If you've somehow avoided Zuma's particular brand of PopCap addiction, the game tasks 
players with quickly destroying an ever advancing snake of colored balls by -- you 
guessed it -- matching up three or more balls of the same color. You've been warned.
