48 min. NTSC

Hitler's Canadians tells the little known story of German POWs in Canada.

In the spring of 1940, small towns across Canada awakened to the sound of Nazi Jackboots. German soldiers, sailors and pilots marched down main streets to hastily constructed camps for some 40,000 POWs on Canadian soil.

With growing ranks of German prisoners and Nazi armies nearing it's shores, Britain saw POWs as a potential threat, and opted to send them to Canada. Between 1940 and 1946, there were 26 camps in Canada where POWs lived in relative luxuruy.

Features numerous dramatic and hilarious escape attempts, the largest prison rebellion in Canadian history, and surprising interviews with former prisoners, whose words reflect the contradictory and complicated nature of the time.

Most of the amenities described in this film were also present in German work camps, until the end of the war, when disease and starvation set in.
