Good day everyone.
I have uploaded 30 mac torrents in the last 30 hours and ill continue daily.
Some notes.

Im doing my best but i cant assure it works for you.
initially i packed my torrents with 7zip.
Why?
Because it has good compression rate and my upload bandwith is slow.
It saves much time for you to download.
.arc would be better but would bringt even more problems.
Its very sad that so many have problems with 7zip.

This is the reason why i have uploaded my last torrents (and all following) in zip format in order to assure better 
working quotes.
For my old torrents you should try these software 
http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19139/ez7z
thanks to http://thepiratebay.se/user/mac04770/ for giving this advice.
After using this software  torrents worked fine for him.



All my torreents are virus free,if there will ever be one,it wasnt me and i did not detected it before uploading.
At this moment nobody detected a single virus in any of my torrents :)

As i already said in comments i dont have mac.
This will change, ill install mac on my windows pc in order to be able to test software and games before sharing.
This will also aloud me to help if theres some troubleshooting.


My upload is maximum 50 kb/s
I would upload much bigger files if it would be better.
I should have become a new connection with 1.25 mb/s (megabyte not megaybit, megabit = 5 mbit/s) 6 weeks ago,
by buying a glassfibre connection, but there are many problems with mya fucking ISP (internet service provider)
I hope to get the new connection soon in  order to dramatically shrink download times for you all.

Its hard for me to check all comments because im uploading so much in short time.
i have to look every hour on every single torrent in order to check all comments.


Thats all till now, if there are considerable changes in my torrents ill  make a new info session.

ENJOY

Kind regards
