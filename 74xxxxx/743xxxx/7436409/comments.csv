,Sedatus,2012-09-07T16:41Z,"Sorry all, haven't been here for a while. I've posted it on Demonoid where it has been successfully shared until the site was taken down. I will try to reseed, or (worst case) upload again."
,Sedatus,2012-09-07T16:53Z,"Alright, up and running again (at least my torrent client shows ""seeding"" status). My upload speed isn't much, so help out when you finally get it downloaded. 
P.S. If anyone gets a hold of decent English subtitles, let me and the others know. Thank you for your patience, you'll soon see it was worth it =)"
