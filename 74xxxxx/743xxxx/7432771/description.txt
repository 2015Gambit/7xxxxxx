                           About SpaceEngine
===============================================================================

SpaceEngine - is a free space simulation software that lets you explore the
universe in three dimensions, starting from planet Earth to the most distant
galaxies. Areas of the known universe are represented using actual astronomical
data, while regions uncharted by human astronomy are generated procedurally.
Millions of galaxies, trillions of stars, countless planets!

Capabilities

- All types of celestial objects are represented: planets, moons, stars, star
  clusters, nebulae and galaxies.
- The observer is free to move around the universe. Transition between any
  celestial body and any scale occurs continuously.
- The observer can move around in space using the WASD keys, like in First
  Person Shooters. Movement with inertia is made possible in Spacecraft mode or
  Aircraft mode.
- "Select and fly" autopilot: just click on any object with the mouse and hit
  the 'G' key to automatically go directly to the object.
- Search for celestial objects by name. Scalable map of the Universe and the
  planetary system maps. Saving locations and an autopilot's journal.
- The orbital motion of planets and stars is calculated in real time, with the
  ability to accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time.
- The orbital paths of celestial objects can be shown, along with their labels
  and celestal grid.
- Automatic binding of the observer to the moving object and automatic
  selection of optimum flight speed.
- Known celestial objects are represented using data from the catalogs:
  galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, planets (our
  Solar system data and known extrasolar planets).
- Uncharted regions of space feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies,
  stars, star clusters, nebulae and planetary systems.
- 3D landscapes of planets and stars: for many solar system bodies actual data
  from space probes is used. For uncharted planets the surface is generated
  procedurally.
- Volumetric 3D sprite models of galaxies and nebulae including light-absorbing
  dust clouds, optimized render to a skybox and impostors.
- Lighting effects: lens flares, solar eclipses, shadows of planetary rings.
  Celestial objects cast light and shadows on to each other.
- The exact model of the Earth's atmosphere (code by Eric Bruneton), adapted
  for the other planets.
- Ability to import users addons: models, catalogs, and textures.
