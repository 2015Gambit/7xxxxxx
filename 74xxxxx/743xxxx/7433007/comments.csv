No.

These are the original unaltered movies as included as bonus discs on previously released special edition DVD trilogy sets.

The DVDs have be stripped of their region code, Star Wars Lego game trailers, menus and other audio/languages, then compressed down to around 30% less (at no image loss) to fit on (and completely use all space on) a single Layer DVD-R disc each.

They all have English subtitles for the whole movies and also a subtitle track just for the non English sections as per the original.

These discs are best way to see the original trilogy 100% unaltered."
,dandeak,2012-07-22T09:39Z,Thank you very much.
,frailwordscollapse,2012-07-31T03:31Z,"@George Lucas: don't bother enhancing the quality and making it more watchable for the re-release. Just leave the good resolutions for your shitty remastered versions. 
@x01s: thanks for the upload all the same."
,MixedUpZombie,2012-08-18T21:26Z,The best way to see the original unaltered trilogy is Harmy's Despecialized Editions.

very likely... although those versions, while close, are still not 100% unaltered."

2nd - A/V - 10/10

3rd - Problem: I want to burn these to DVDs using ConvertXToDVD, problem is they are in ISO, so I figured I'd just extract them and it'd be fine.

Only thing is when they extract some of the parts  [2,4,5] are being read by windows as being over 26hrs, which makes my converter program think the files are huge [125gb] and ConvertX confused thinking they are [1hr 25minutes].

I tried extracting from WINRAR and Power ISO, didn't make any difference. When I play the parts in VLC it reads 14:12, which is the actual time. I could use Power ISO to burn them, but I prefer ConvertX's methods.

Any Help Would Be Greatly Appreciated."
