""The reaction we've gotten from everybody on this is 'Yeah. Cool. I want to see that.' That's exactly the reaction we want. Yeah, this is a crazy, off the wall idea. Come along for the ride,"" explained Tieri of the out there concept that sees mob-killing superhero Frank Castle transported to the deepest reaches of outer space as painted by artist Mark Texeira."
