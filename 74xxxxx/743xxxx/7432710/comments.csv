,diego.vieira,2012-07-13T03:03Z,"nope, didn't worked - sorry"
,diego.vieira,2012-07-13T03:13Z,"Ah, worked.
After doing this:

Xilisoft added a hidden registry key, which wont allow you to add any more keys after the first key gets blocked. So here is a workaround:

1-Start
2-Run
3-Type in Regedit
4-Select HKEY_USERS
5-Press Ctrl + f (Search)
6-Search for {C06F4056-C35F-4bf8-A93A-9F098F3E503D}
7-Delete the Key, including the subkeys

,access8,2012-07-15T18:53Z,Suggest a scan before unzipping.  AVG shows three Trojan horses.  
,brianxxx,2012-07-16T00:19Z,Just a warning - AVG has very high false positive detection rate.
,Damien74,2012-07-17T03:31Z,"Scanned with Kaspersky, no viruses."
,Damien74,2012-07-17T03:46Z,"Thanks!

,SerSpec-V,2012-07-22T19:54Z,Do what diego.vieira said. After I patched it serials wouldn't work but once I edited the REG I typed in a serial/name from 7.1.0 and it worked. @junyo21 it's only trial if you have failed to patch/crack it. And AVG calls everything a virus so stop using it people. 
,Tnx969,2012-07-23T09:34Z,diego.vieira>>> you saved my life!! Your trick works! Thankzz a lott!! I registered using my name and random key and it worked like charm!! Awsome stuff!!!

1.- Disconnect from Internet
2.- Install Software (but don't lunch it)
3.- Copy patch to installed DIR
4.- Apply patch (Which will replace a .dll file)
5.- Now lunch the Soffware
6.- Register with whatever info you like
