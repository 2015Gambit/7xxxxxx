,extracube,2012-07-13T20:07Z,"Sorry Niles, do you think your steps listed above (to burn Win7 iso to bootable USB) would also work well with Windows XP?  Sorry for off topic question."
,RinTosaka,2012-07-13T20:53Z,"This one lacks IE9, correct?  I'm just making sure."
,b_addy,2012-07-13T21:17Z,"@extracube, that metod does'n work fo xp.
To install xp  from usb, google WinSetupFromUSB."
,b_addy,2012-07-13T21:18Z,"nileshtambe, in 698 mb you kept wmc, wmp and ie?
Did you make a linux based verion? :P"
,nileshtambe,2012-07-15T08:34Z,"@RinTosaka
yep ur right no IE9 as iso going above 700mb

@b_addy 
thanks...."
,extracube,2012-07-17T17:34Z,"Niles, I was wondering if you had a slim or light version of Windows XP -- reason I ask is because I have a 2008 Acer Aspire netbook with the slow ""flash"" hard drive.  Do you have a smaller, faster Windows XP?  I thought of going Linux but I need XP for some software."
,nileshtambe,2012-07-17T18:02Z,"@extracube 
do u know (eXPerience)
http://thepiratebay.se/user/eXPer1ence/
try this smallest one 99mb
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4254053/MicroXP_v0.82_-_eXPerience

for me problem is with my display (graphic card) all my laptops have either ati or nvidia graphic
and  i don't have any graphic driver for xp, and never these companies released it for xp , so if i make one  cant test nicely and  slimming xp is totally  diff than 7.
thanks for ur concern , good luck !!!!!!!!!!"
,extracube,2012-07-17T19:24Z,"@niles, great, I will look into those, especially that 99mb one you listed, has a nice info writeup.  hopefully streamlined system = better speed, performance.

@b_addy, up above, almost forgot - thanks for the file name WinSetupFromUSB, I downloaded it but yet to use. maybe this weekend..  thanks."
,RinTosaka,2012-07-18T02:44Z,"extracube, I personally use ""XP Performance Edition"" by tj007s13.  With a stock installation it'll only use something like 80MB of RAM."
,RinTosaka,2012-07-18T02:46Z,"Specifically, this one:

,ImKris,2012-07-20T00:12Z,"What the hell .. does this include just Windows Media Center, or the whole windows 7 download?

I just need windows media center!"
,extracube,2012-07-20T16:57Z,"Rin thanks for that.  Am downloading one right now, 326.19mb.  Will try on a day off."

or  

1. type regedit on the Start Search
2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem
3. Delete the EnableInstallerDetection entry
4. You can now try to run  installer even without rebooting or logout to your account. "
