NOTE: If using VLC Media Player, Right Click, Subtitle, Disable if you do not want Subtitles or simply delete the .srt files.  However, if you delete the .srt files, there will be no Subtitles at all.  Also, the audio in Episode 10 is a little off because it was off in the source I downloaded from.  This can be fixed by simply tapping the ΓÇ£JΓÇ¥ key in VLC 3 or 4 times creating an audio delay of -150ms or -200 ms.  

2nd NOTE: My Internet has been on and off as of late, and I do not have that great of upload speeds, so please be patient when downloading.  If there are no seeders, I should be back soon.
