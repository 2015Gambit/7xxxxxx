,zathras69,2012-07-17T08:38Z,"Hey Mike, you can permanently fix that audio delay using mkvmerge. Drop in the file, highlight the audio stream, click on format specific options at the bottom and put -150 in the delay setting. 2 minutes and done, easy-peezy."
,game88,2012-07-17T18:08Z,It can be fixed if it has a constant delay from start else if delay from late or particular portion or delay at some points then its hard to adjust and mike is uploading several other things i guess we can adjust this little delays using our media players or respective software of other players etc
