 Don't they realise that they are insulting every encoder whose work they do this to?
The only acceptable time to add their tag to a release name is if the encoder is releasing specifically for the PublicHD site or if they release a batch of episodes which are all by various encoders, if it's a single encoders work you add the encoders name, not your own.
 This site is uploading every torrent with their own tag added and insulting everybody who creates the videos which they would not have a site without.
 They need to sort their act out and stop trying to cash in on everyone elses good reputations."

DibyaTPB is adding the PublicHD in brackets separated by a space from the release name. The are not claiming they are the ones who made the file, just that they are the ones who made this torrent of it. They have added their name at the end of the listing's name on TPB which is useful for differentiating between the different torrents for the same thing. Many sites do this, such as eztv. They have not removed the original release group's name and they have not added their name to the original file in the torrent itself so there isn't really any problem that I can see."

- When do we? Nearly the whole TV category is run by the scene. So are they affiliated to PublicHD?

Don't they realise that they are insulting every encoder whose work they do this to?

- What? When? Moreover we are bringing their work infront of many people. They mainly upload at private sites, and there are very few uploaders who upload Web-DLs as they die pretty fast.

- Seriously? I guess then the whole torrent world be down. Also I may turn Stephen Hawking.

This site is uploading every torrent with their own tag added and insulting everybody who creates the videos which they would not have a site without.
They need to sort their act out and stop trying to cash in on everyone elses good reputations. 

- Your questions have been replied above. We have never edited the name of a single torrent, nor the name of release group. Just adding a .txt file and a tag within square bracket hurts you so much? Go complain against eztv, complain against all the uploaders. Nobody will care. Kindly Stop whinning, I respect you and your uploads.

Thanks sildragon. :)"
