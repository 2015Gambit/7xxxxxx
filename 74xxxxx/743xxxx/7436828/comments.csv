,p.m.t.,2012-07-13T05:43Z,Anyone sure it is 1080p??? the file list shows a DVD source files :D
[V],HDvideos,2012-07-13T11:24Z,"Its not a Rip..
Its a DVD9 and is actually released by TmG.."
,detroitmalujoe,2012-07-14T13:31Z,"Thanks TejasNair for uploading this torrent which appears to be superb quality.

Just a note, it would probably have been helpful to compress the DVD image to 3-4GB .iso file. Quicker download, high quality and easier to seed.

I am trying to D/L and seed but looks like peers are not there. 

DOES THIS HAVE SUBTITLES? I hope so..."
,poona1011,2012-07-16T07:44Z,Pls seed.....
