,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-07-25T23:18Z,"How many more ""Led Zeppelin IV"" uploads do you really think The Pirate Bay needs? Seriously, mate?

Simply typing ""led zeppelin iv"" into the search bar reveals this:
http://thepiratebay.se/search/led%20zeppelin%20iv/0/99/0

And typing ""led zeppelin iv vinyl"" reveals this:
http://thepiratebay.se/search/led%20zeppelin%20iv%20vinyl/0/99/0"
