 After years of painstaking research at the  
 cost of his domestic pleasure, Dr.          
 Dipankar Roy discovers a vaccine for        
 leprosy. The news is flashed over television
 and overnight; an insignificant junior      
 doctor receives international recognition.  
 Professional jealousy and abuse of power    
 threaten Dr. Roy, even as the Secretary     
 of Health reprimands him for breaking       
 the news to the press. He is asked to       
 report to the Director of Health.           
 Professional colleagues Dr. Arijit Sen      
 and Dr. Ramananda invite him to a           
 lecture but it is merely a pretence to      
 humiliate him. Dr. Roy suffers a mild heart 
 attack but he refuses to go to the hospital.
 His wife and few others like Dr. Kundu stand
 by Dr. Roy, but the harassment continues;   
 a letter from an American foundation is     
 suppressed and Dr. Roy transferred to a     
 remote village.
