,liquiddandruff,2012-07-21T08:47Z,"works great and i love the interface!

the only thing i had trouble with was that windows downloaded the wrong display and sound drivers but i got it working after. Great release and thanks again for your hard work!"

,MhrBhr,2012-07-23T01:00Z,"I am confused if this one is good or not.
Please if someone used it to tell."
,LuxLOL,2012-07-23T06:26Z,Install VirtualBox and try it out yourself.
,AkitoElPerro,2012-07-24T22:52Z,"LuxLOL, I really like this Windows but I`m having trouble setting it up in spanish. Also, does it not have .net framework?"
,LuxLOL,2012-07-25T08:51Z,"Watch a youtube video on how install Windows XP new.
And the .NET Frameworks are not included because this can have conflicts if you install new .NET Framework updates from the Windows Update Center.
Better to install the .NET Frameworks directly for the Windows XP Update Center to aviod this problem."
,gerdon,2012-07-25T08:52Z,can i install this on ATA hard disc
,LuxLOL,2012-07-25T09:26Z,"Yes you can.
But i always recommend to test it first with VirtualBox to be 100% if the SATA driver is included for your PC."
,lovysta,2012-07-26T06:25Z,"hi LuxLOL! where can i find the virtual box, free donload. thanks"
,LuxLOL,2012-07-26T10:02Z,"www.virtualbox.org
Every information is also written in the Read Me file. ;-)"
,emesma,2012-07-27T06:00Z,My sata driver is not included while in version was. And can't find it. I really want to install this!!!
,LuxLOL,2012-07-27T06:57Z,"Read the Read Me file section ->
(o) How to Remove the included Drivers and include you own Drivers"
,emesma,2012-07-28T03:27Z,The problem is that I haven't found my SATA drivers. Is it possible to get it from other Windows XP Installation CD?
,LuxLOL,2012-07-28T04:14Z,"A normal WinXP has no SATA driver included.
Everything you need is written in the Read Me file, if there was another way i would have written it in the Read Me file."
,lovysta,2012-07-29T00:32Z,"come on guys! just downloaded the stuff and it works great. just grab a copy for urself. And to my man LuxLOL, just wanna say congratulations, U did a good job u know? keep up man!"

@TheSoula
Read Me file ->

* If you want to test whether the burned ISO file works on your computer then install the program VirtualBox from ""www.virtualbox.org"" and if you have SATA Hard disk drive then you need to set the Virtual Hard disk drive option in VirtualBox from IDE to SATA."
,TheSoula,2012-08-02T01:53Z,"thank you
my harddrive is NTFS,
i downloaded this torrent but dont see a readme file,
i am a newbie , sorry, dont get upset lol

ty"
,robthegeek,2012-08-02T04:31Z,Why is the extension a windows shell command why is not a iso image?
,LuxLOL,2012-08-02T07:38Z,"@TheSoula
You need to open the ZIP file there you will find the Read Me file.
And NTFS has nothing to do with SATA i recomment you first use VirtualBox and play around before installing a Windows new on your PC.

@robthegeek
The ISO file is in the ZIP file open it and extract it."
,bricky149,2012-08-02T22:16Z,"Hey LuxLOL,

I've been using your Windows XP Black Edition ISOs for about a year now and I've been very happy using them.
When do you plan to do a Windows 7 ""Black Edition?"" I don't plan to move to Windows 8 as I don't feel comfortable using it.

I also have a suggestion for you: Why not include AIMP into your ISOs? I've found it to be a fantastic music player (I know it can't play videos) and the v3.10 release is as good as ever.

Keep up the good work! :-)"
,rawmacias,2012-08-06T15:07Z,does this have media center ?
,LuxLOL,2012-08-06T15:32Z,Yes it has see the Read Me file (Windows Media Player 11).
,lmv92,2012-08-07T17:18Z,"I'm still trying to figure out how to change the language. Other than that, excellent (or rather perfect) work ;)"
,nafroe,2012-08-11T20:28Z,"Does this have the ""Automatic Updates"" enabled? Will I still be able to receive those Windows updates?"
,LuxLOL,2012-08-11T23:05Z,Yes. And this is also written in the Read Me file.
,quittix3,2012-08-12T06:27Z,"This windows install is total bullshit, I tried installing it on my computer onto the hard drive and I had the installer and everything on my flash drive, and WITHOUT ANY FUCKING WARNING this damn thing erased everything on my flash drive and started installing this bullshit on my flash drive before I could even get to a screen to pick where I want to install it!!!

Not only that, I tried using the update windows choice on the installer while on my current operating system and it did whatever the fuck it did, and now windows on the damn computer wont even start at all, and when I do turn it on, it says there are files in the i386 folder and it cant continue and not my computer just sits there and loops on this crap.."
,LuxLOL,2012-08-12T20:08Z,"If you do a flash installation and you never done it before then you should first read some tutorials or watch some youtube videos on how you do a Windows XP flash installation with the WinToFlash tool or with every other flash tool you like to use.

And i explicitly said in the Read Me file to test everthing first in VirtualBox before doing a live installation."
