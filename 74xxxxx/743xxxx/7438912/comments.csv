[V],scene4all,2012-07-13T11:40Z,"lol sorry its actually english, by mistake i selected Dutch."
,Damien_Hexicola,2012-07-13T13:58Z,is this the version with all the tech difficulty?
,Damien_Hexicola,2012-07-13T14:09Z,"if you're wondering what i mean, i was watching it online and about 30 minutes in the volume went blank, it looked as if they couldn't go to commercals  and when there was volume it was kinda choppy..."
,Ibarehere,2012-07-13T16:15Z,Yes this version is very choppy the sound does drop out and there are black moments. On the other hand you for once get to see what goes on after a match. The cleaners coming into ring etc.
,Ibarehere,2012-07-13T16:48Z,"Also guys as a second thought....
Please remember TNA is filmed live now so maybe this was just one of those nights if you know what I mean. I still enjoyed the show and even though as said before the sound does drop out. It is only when the guys are cleaning the ring in between matches. The show itself is still all there. TY Scene4all for ALL your downloads.
I will be looking for wwe Friday night Smackdown when uploaded as well as Impact again same time next week ;)
Thank You."
,oeyv1,2012-07-13T17:52Z,Thank you scene4all. I'm a big fan of your downloads of wrestling. You are the best :) Keep download more :)
,ToMMyHR,2012-07-14T12:40Z,"Please tell me that people aren't as stupid as they seem... it says ""UNCUT"". Therefore, it means the commercials are NOT in there, but the pause in between (where the commercials would be) IS in there! Therefore... uncut! Is that really that hard to figure out? :-/ Seriously?"
,ToMMyHR,2012-07-14T12:42Z,"BTW, thanks scene4all! :-)"
