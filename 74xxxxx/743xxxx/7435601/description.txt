Hoax Hunters #1 [IMAGE Comics]


Cryptids. Aliens. Monsters. All the worlds bizarre secrets - what if they were real? Their existence would be debunked by a reality TV show! HOAX HUNTERS is that show, publicly disproving all variety of lore. But their real goal is the opposite: as the worlds dark corners surface, the HOAX HUNTERS cover them up.
