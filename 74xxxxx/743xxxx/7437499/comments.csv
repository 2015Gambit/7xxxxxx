,daba_1,2012-07-13T17:03Z,"Jazz enthusiasts frequently refer to Bob Koester's Delmark Records as a ""Chicago jazz label,"" but it is better to describe Delmark as a ""jazz/blues label"" because the blues have also been a big chunk of Delmark's business. Indeed, the impressive list of blues greats who have recorded for Delmark over the years includes, among many others, Sleepy John Estes, Magic Sam, Jimmy Dawkins, Big Joe Williams, J.B. Hutto, Junior Wells, and Roosevelt Sykes. Most of those artists had long since passed away when, on March 7, 2008, Delmark celebrated its contributions to the blues with an event/concert at Buddy Guy's Legends (one of Chicago's top blues clubs). But as It Ain't Over: Delmark Celebrates 55 Years of Blues demonstrates, the company continued to have a healthy blues roster in the late 2000s. That event/concert of March 7, 2008 (which Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley officially declared ""Delmark Records Day in Chicago"") is documented on It Ain't Over, which Delmark released in both CD and DVD versions; the DVD contains some performances that aren't on the 63-minute CD. Much of Delmark's late-2000s roster was present at the Legends event, and a mood of enthusiasm and excitement prevails on performances by Lurrie Bell (""Don't You Lie to Me""), Zora Young (""Til the Fat Lady Sings""), Jimmy Johnson (""Cold, Cold Feeling,"" ""You Don't Know What Love Is""), Shirley Johnson (""As the Years Go Passing By""), and others. It isn't hard to understand why there was so much enthusiasm on Legends' stage that night; Delmark has a fine reputation in Chicago's blues community, and the fact that Koester's company had lasted 55 years was indeed cause for celebration. It Ain't Over is a rewarding document of Delmark's 55th anniversary event."
