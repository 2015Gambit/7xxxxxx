P.M. DAWN DISCOGRAPHY [FLAC] and [MP3 - 320Kbps]


Also written as 'PM Dawn'. 

Current member: Dr. Giggles aka Doc G [2005]

PM Dawn was founded by the two brothers Attrell S. Cordes AKA Prince Be and Jarrett Cordes AKA DJ Minute Mix.
Their cousin Dr. Giggles aka Doc G was added to the lineup for their 2005 comeback, right after which Jarrett was fired from the band. PM Dawn continued with Doc G replacing Jarrett. It has lately been informed that Attrell Cordes suffered from a few strokes and that his health status does not allow him to continue with the band.

In the current state of affairs, their cousin Doc G has practically "inherited" the PM Dawn flag, and is touring as PM Dawn performing their songs.
