,jomjom79,2012-07-12T00:34Z,Well im trying to seed as much as i can but i might be going away for a few days now. For anyone in real hurry you can watch the part 1 live at vimeo
,johanneswiberg,2012-07-12T01:09Z,"I'm not complaining at all, I wasn't in a rush just as long as I could find it. But if and whenever you get a chance to upload more eps, I'd be much appreciated!
Sidenote: Do you know why it just says ""end credits"" at the end instead of real credits? Is this copy not a broadcasted one?"
,jomjom79,2012-07-12T02:11Z,"Sorry, didnt mean it like that:) Was more or less talking to everyone who tried to download it as my seeding was very poor.

I really dont know what kind of copy this is, it was released on Vimeo 3 months ago infact so its probably some early production version. 

Vimeo also has Part 1 of Mexico online.

,johanneswiberg,2012-07-12T14:35Z,"Can't find anything on Vimeo, not this one either... prehaps because I'm in Sweden :("
,dirtydave99,2012-07-13T04:47Z,Awesome -- Thank you. I've been looking for this for a while. Hard to find - you should get your skull for this upload!!
,jomjom79,2012-07-13T18:46Z,"Go to vimeo and search for the channel ""BuzzTaxi Travel & Adventure""

There are the two episodes
"
,Mimsy,2012-07-17T01:19Z,"It turns out that the Vimeo channel belongs to the production company, and that 2 of the 4 episodes of this show have been leaked to the public months before screening on Canadian television. 

It has Norway Part 1 and Mexico/Tiburon Part 1, all we need is the 2nd parts to these episodes. "
,altonreap,2012-07-19T00:28Z,"Hey guys just posted part 1 of Tiburon Island here:

,jomjom79,2012-07-26T12:23Z,"Does anyone know when the next episode is airing? Man, even finding a episode guide on this show is damn near impossible! Even IMDB doesnt have anything on it...
"
,trentonresident,2012-07-26T15:52Z,Also looking for part two of the two mentioned here.
,Mimsy,2012-08-01T18:24Z,"Canadians have brought shame upon their country for not uploading the remaining episodes, isn't there a single ripper in the country?"
,trentonresident,2012-08-02T16:50Z,+1 Mimsy!
,Optimus_past_my_Prime,2012-08-03T14:26Z,The show hasn't even gone to air yet and won't until August 19. Good things come to those who wait.
,Rustblade,2012-08-04T03:37Z,"thats bullshit. norway has aired for sure, both episodes. i know this because i watched them on OLN. dont know if mexico has aired yet. 

he's only doing the two specials, norway and mexico. that's it."
,Optimus_past_my_Prime,2012-08-06T15:48Z,It looks like you're right. I did read that in some article but it is currently on the OLN schedule. My bad. Carry on.
,trentonresident,2012-08-07T01:17Z,Come on! Someone find and post mofos! :)
,Rustblade,2012-08-16T06:36Z,"i don't get what's going on. part 2 of norway and mexico are literally IMPOSSIBLE to find, like they don't even exist."
,trentonresident,2012-08-16T15:44Z,"I saw a promo somewhere that these will be airing in the US this weekend, I think. Hope someone uploads them."
