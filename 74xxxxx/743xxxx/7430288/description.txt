Esquire Magazine UK August 2012

Esquire UK magazine is the discerning man's lifestyle magazine. Addressing the 
entertainment requirements and values of the modern man with wit and sophistication, 
Esquire is a magazine with cut and thrust, and none of the tackiness and banality of 
many women's lifestyle magazines. Very chunky and printed on high quality paper, 
Esquire magazine is a complete stylish package for every man with brains, 
taste, and a good sense of irony
