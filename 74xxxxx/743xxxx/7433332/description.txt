 Salim, the young man with a limp,         
 inhabits a twilight zone. At one level,   
 he belongs to a respectable, proud,       
 though poor family. Salim's roots go      
 deep into this congested, impoverished    
 Muslim neighbourhood. But Salim has       
 also discovered another world, a world    
 of deceptive charm and fatal allurement,  
 organized crime, where a little           
 intimidation, flashing of a knife,        
 unspoken threats of concrete 'mob' action,
 bring in quick, easy bucks. Tears,        
 and the price to be paid, come later.
