MSc Management of Intellectual Property -Queen Mary University.rar

this is all the study material that you would learn in one year at qmul and its free for use by anyone. 

as a former student who wasted time and money for this university and this course, i have decided to share this information to future students not to waste their time and money for such a stupid course that dosent even give you a job at the end of the day.

so please make it free and share it.if you require more information please email me and any help or advice i am ready to help.

the entire intellectual property field in the UK cosist of only ENGLISH people who wont even give a chance to coloured people whether they are british or not. 

I pity such a small field and the practitioners in it.!!
