Congrats on your skull and thanks again for the oldies, but goodies"

But providers are telling me I'm getting the maximum I can have in my neighborhood. They also say it will improve soon. By then, all the collection will be uploaded ..."

I think you have the best collection of film noir on the bay. I also like when you inform whether a copy is a bad or not. I see more folks are seeding that's great! I always look for your uploads. 
Thx for sharing."
