TOTALLY WORTH IT!

Anyways...when Fry was surfing the sewers with Leela's dad and Bender, shouldn't he become mutated? Because I remember from one of the earlier episodes that any human who touches the sewer waste water, will become mutated? It was that episode when it turned out that Leela's actually a mutant because she sacrificed herself and jumped into the sewer waste water and didn't get mutated. Even she didn't know it herself that she was a mutant, only her parents knew."
