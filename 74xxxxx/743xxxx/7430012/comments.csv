,DemiAngelX,2012-07-11T02:49Z,"No problem man, this game is a rare classic worth sharing. If anyone has a request for a game they would like me to upload, let me know and I'll check if I have it. I'm kind of a pack rat, so I hang on to everything I download :)

So if anyone has a request, any questions, or would like to play a game online etc., tell me here or add me on Skype: angel-of-sorrow89"
,DemiAngelX,2012-07-12T09:32Z,"Give me at least 10 good seeders here, and I'll upload another rare game :)"
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-12T13:16Z,"I have a request or 2, one isn't so much of a rare classic game, but it's an amazing game with 8-bit style graphics! Scott Pilgrim vs The World and the Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix! =D I have searched and I know they are both for PC, but it's hard to find them. Plus Scott Pilgrim vs The World has their new dlc coming out, online playability and Wallace Wells as a new character. Any chance you can upload either of these? Whether you have them or can find them and crack them?"
