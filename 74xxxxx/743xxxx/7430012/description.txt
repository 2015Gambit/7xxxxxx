>>>Red Faction 2, English Version<<<

How to Install:

1.) Burn or Mount first disc "RFACTION2_1" to start installation. Mount second disc when prompted.
2.) Start up the included "mfpatchsteam.exe", and browse for the "rf2.exe" in the game's folder. Select it, then click "Start" to apply the memory patch.
3.) Make sure the first disc is mounted, and enjoy the game. It does not require a CD-crack, unless you don't want to mount the disc.


I decided to upload this game since I was super-lucky enough to find it at a used game store, and I couldn't find a download for it anywhere. I can only upload this at 100kb right now, so seeding would be greatly appreciated, as always. This is a fresh Rip from the CD's themselves, and I have tested all of this myself, so it should work for most people. There is also a 1.01 patch available for this game, but I suggest that you DO NOT download it, because the Memory Fix will not work with it. The fix is required for most modern operating systems, especially 64-bit.

But anyways, enjoy the game, and seed as always :)
