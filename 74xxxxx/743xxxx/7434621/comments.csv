why are you not seeding?"
,jdizzle22,2012-07-17T17:02Z,"last torrent was stuck at 99.8% and I had to download this one, which is also now stuck because of no seeders...you have to stop wasting peoples bandwidth man, not ok...plz seed or plz stop uploading torrents. TY for the effort though."
,DMCbr,2012-07-21T16:34Z,stuck at 59% for like...1 week! no seeds at all! >.
,Jodeth,2012-09-09T13:11Z,"Just started downloading now. God I hope it downloads completely! I came from an emulated Wii version of RE4 and while it looked freakin great, it was also sluggish and sound glitchy often. I have high hopes for this one. All the mods look promising!
One question: Does it crash a lot?
I had a pirated copy before and it got very unstable later on in the game."
,Jodeth,2012-09-09T13:49Z,Stuck at 59.4%  Wtf? It was downloading FAST then went to a screeching halt. Come on w3schools! I'll buy you a drink if you'll seed!
