Meanwhile you could try with win version, I saw a __MACOSX with another exe inside the file, maybe it's made for Mac users.

I will try to find it but have a look yourself on the net, I don't need it. 

When I downloaded the Pro Shaders package there where two versions in one rar. I unpacked it and made two torrent so you don't have to download both and so that you can find it in the right section.

I do my best, and just for fun"
