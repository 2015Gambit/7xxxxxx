,TailsFan23,2012-07-13T09:58Z,Can we get some more seeders for this? 
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-07-14T10:37Z,"seed please, stuck at 80.6%"
,furikazashi,2012-07-15T01:58Z,"Katy Perry's Sweet Treats isn't apart of ShowTime, It's a seperate one. Sorry."
,jjsreps,2012-07-15T20:56Z,do you think you could get the sims 3 supernatural

,glennetic,2012-07-17T22:51Z,"When I tried to click on the other set-ups, only Pets would show up and it asked me if I wanted to uninstall it for every expansion pack. I have origin and EADM but it doesn't show up on my origin and whenever I tried playing it, it says I don't have a disc."
,furikazashi,2012-07-18T02:54Z,Update the game through the launcher not through Origins - makes it harder then it is.  and if pets is showing up on each one I don't think you're unmounting your disc image (if mounting) or you burned it Pets on all the discs (hopefully not)
,glennetic,2012-07-18T09:37Z,"All of the setups are the same size (390KB), I dunno if I accidentally burned it all as Pets in the process of trying to figure it out, but I tried to unmount something using the MagicISO but it still shows up as Pets for each set-up. Plus whenever I tried installing Pets, it said that things in the bin aren't matching up but I just clicked ignore to all of it. I spent more than 5 days trying to download it so I'm determined for it to work o:< 
if anyone's willing to help me, my email is glennrawr@hotmail.com :D"
,brunogs06,2012-07-18T21:38Z,"First, thank you for this! It's really nice! But I did everything you learnt us inside of the torrent.. but after updating everything, this updates the sims 3 into a 1.36 version.. after updating each expansion, clicking in each launc e downloading the updates, i put the cracks as usual.. when I click on the sims 3 launcher, there's a message which says that i installed a non-oficial modification in my game, not compatible with my current version of The Sims 3. In addiction, it says that I can have problems during the game and asks me if i wanna continue or close the game. If I continue, the game has problems in the beggining and it closes. If i close the game, well.. it closes!
Please, help me! I'm really sad and I lost too much time reinstalling it many times. Can you tell me what it is? Sorry for my english!"
,furikazashi,2012-07-18T22:49Z,"it will always say you uninstalled so and so , but go fourth and click continue on that and the game will work properly with no issues whatsoever =) thank you"
,brunogs06,2012-07-18T23:13Z,Everytime i click continue the game doesnt Run propperly

,theone1990,2012-07-20T12:06Z,"I created this acc just to tell u guys what i did to finally work the game. 

1st problem: Crash on loading screen
For this problem, i updated my graphics card and changed the vertical sync under the 3D settings to off.

2nd problem: Buy mode invisible
For this problem, I used the sims 3 ultimate fix.

(http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-ultimate-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems)

It also solves the problem with ""installed a non-oficial modification in my game""

I advice applying the ultimate fix b4 changing the graphic card settings 

Hope it helps."
,brunogs06,2012-07-20T18:43Z,"theone1990, thank you for you help. I'll try this. But before doing that, I should do exactly what is written inside the torrent? Just after that, I do what is written in the link you've posted?
hugs"
,akablade,2012-07-20T19:36Z,"@ theone1990

Omg Thank You!! It worked like a charm! I cant thank you enough "
,brunogs06,2012-07-20T19:50Z,"@akablade
tell me
before doing that, I should do exactly what is written inside the torrent? Just after that, I do what is written in the link that @theone1990 has posted?
hugs"
,akablade,2012-07-21T00:53Z,"@ brunogs06 
yes, first follow the instructions in the torrent, then apply the ""sims 3 ultimate fix"" then changed the vertical sync under the 3D settings to off."
,brunogs06,2012-07-21T03:31Z,@akablade but the ultimate fix will change the vertical sync under 3D settings to off? PrĂ­stino do that? And how i do that? Ty
,brunogs06,2012-07-21T08:23Z,"ooooh, this worked! thank you aaal guys!"
,RuBpErTz,2012-07-23T19:56Z,please seeeeeed! it takes years!
,mschristi,2012-07-24T19:26Z,seed! it's saying it's going to take weeks...FOR REAL?
,syllwiiaaj,2012-07-24T22:38Z,I followed the instructions and it still doesn't work;/ keeps on saying i have an unofficial game modification...how can i fix this? 
,Nimilara,2012-07-26T07:21Z,"Call me a Newb, but after I got the basic game installed and the patch automatically installed..It now tells me that 'Desc authorization failure' how do I fix this? Or, do I have to download and unzip more files from that website theone1990 posted?"
,Nimilara,2012-07-26T08:09Z,"I downloaded the link from theone1990, followed the instructions and now it went from saying 'desc authorization failure' to 'Service initialization failed (0x024e424f)'. And now, it tells me that the launcher doesn't respond either. -sighs- I'm already frustrated with this game, as I waited a week for it and now I can't even play it >< How do I fix this, before I stop seeding it and uninstall it off my comp?"
,benohmygosh,2012-07-27T19:41Z,"Step 1 - READ THIS (EVERYTHING) before installing http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1171-must-read-how-to-install-the-sims-3-correctly

Step 2 - After installing base game, open launcher and update manually and close launcher before installing next expansion. Do this for every expansion until PET'S expansion.

Step 3 - DO NOT USE THE CRACK in furikazashi's folder after installing all expansion. FOLLOW the instruction in STEP'S 1 website! Game Key Codes can be used just not the CRACKS in furikazashi FOLDER!

If you have done this steps correctly you will have no problem or whatsoever crash and shit going on in game. And if everything is done correctly and you want to mod please refer to this website  http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files

Goodluck installing!"

,darkhawk6,2012-09-09T09:30Z,"ok so i unistalled everything and reinstalled just the base game and the lifetime wishes are there, so the problem i was having must be in one of the expansions.......so if i can only use the base game there isnt much point to this torrent....."
,Rfl4222,2012-09-10T03:02Z,"It has most of the pack's in-game. But you're missing some Expansion Packs: Generations, Supernatural (Just Released) and Seasons. Also from the Stuff Pack: Master Suite, and Diesel pack. I dare not mention Katy's Treats' because that pack looks shitty. Anyways, can you please update the pack because I would not like to scramble around looking for the other stuff. In advance, it must have took you a long time to set this up, and I thank you. Now I'm going to download this."
,Rfl4222,2012-09-10T03:06Z,"Oh, and for god's sake, please put a video of this."
