Nature's Power Revealed
We can't control them, we can't accurately predict them, and they can produce some of our biggest tragedies, but nature's awesome powers have also shaped Earth, replenishing and renewing it every day. From the molten core of our planet to the protective embrace of our atmosphere and the water which supports all life, watch as we reveal nature's greatest powers.


1)  Earths Heart of Fire Proper 
When the relatively thin layer of the Earth's crust is disturbed, earthquakes remind us that our planet is continually restless. If the molten interior that is our planet's heart of fire breaks through, volcanoes show that they can be one of the most devastating of nature's powers. Watch as Mount St. Helens explodes after an earthquake. See what happens when a jumbo jet unwittingly flies into a cloud of volcanic dust. Travel across the Galapagos Islands to appreciate how volcanoes are creators of new land, and how that provides opportunities for nature to take hold. Travel to the ocean abyss to discover what life forms thrive around super heated vents.
