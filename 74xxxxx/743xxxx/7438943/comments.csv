,FastForwarder,2012-07-14T02:41Z,Yeah I agree. Why don't you confirm it works before uploading. Many of your uploads I can find on 0day boards and download a working scene release from core or lz0 instead of taking chances on your unknown please confirm uploads.

I have bought so many games from apple so I feel like it's time to get something for free ;) Thanks!"
