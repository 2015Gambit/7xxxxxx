,yobar23,2012-07-12T01:47Z,"Thanks, eztv, but for some reason this FoV stuff never works in my Bluray players.  I've had FoV mp4's and mkv's and none of it will play, even the first 2 episodes of this show.  Can't imagine why.  As a matter of fact, is there an upload of this episode that is non-FoV?  Much would be appreciated."
