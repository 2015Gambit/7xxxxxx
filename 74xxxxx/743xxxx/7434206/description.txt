Young but uniquely experienced, Phillip LaRue has an admirable grip on how to live, and the proof is written all over his debut solo album, Let the Road Pave Itself. An organic set of songs for the digital age, it was tracked live in the studio to an old fashioned two-inch tape reel, warmly capturing the sound of Phillip and his friends playing real time rock thatΓÇÖs only ever concerned with lifeΓÇÖs deepest matters of love and faith. Most everything else can take care of itself. PhillipΓÇÖs path began in California. An athlete until sixteen, he picked up the guitar after getting sidelined by mononucleosis. Without premeditation, his new interest turned into a duo with his sister, Natalie, and they scored a record deal in Nashville where the family was about to relocate from Arizona. Three albums and four years of touring followed. "I grew up on the road at that point," recalls Phillip. "It was strange having people look up to me who were twice my age, but a fun way to see the world and find my true faith in the process."
