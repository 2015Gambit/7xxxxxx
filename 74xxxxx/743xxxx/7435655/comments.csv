,SrMLove,2012-07-15T05:48Z,"@Kristyleesweetie: over 1000 seeders and over 600 leechers... and you are the only one to post a comment complaining about the file type. you must be new ..... b/c:  EZTV is #1 and they should be nothing but showered with complements and thank you's, but you're either dumb and/or lazy ass bitches about how you want an ""avi"" version of the show. D/L THE FILE AND CONVERT IT YOURSELF YA LAZY BITCH. most likely you are to dumb to handle that, so you shouldn't even be on this site... go use ""youtube"" or ""hulu"" or some other free site for people with no technological ability. oh yeah.. and enjoy the viruses im sure your dumbass self will get... who knows maybe they will infect you with a trojan and gain access to your computer and they can run your computer from theirs.... they are bound to do more intelligent things than you will.. sorry but kristy-sweety you needed a little virtual smack in the face.. hope it doesn't sting to bad. good luck."
