National Geographic - Reptiles 
Reptiles and amphibians ruled the world for nearly 200 million years and today there are still over 12,500 of them. Some are huge, the deadliest creatures on earth. Some are tiny, among the strangest to be found anywhere. Together, they not only outnumber mammals or birds but in their colourful variety and extraordinary behaviour, they far surpass them. 
So where did these ancient creatures come from? How have they transformed themselves into the bizarre and beautiful forms that are alive today? And what's the secret of their epic success?



2)  Ultimate Viper 
Vipers have been evolving their way towards the top of the reptile heap for millions of years. Armed with an amazing arsenal of deadly tools, vipers have proven to be remarkably successful predators. However, in an ever-changing world where skills new and old are constantly put to test, how will these magnificent reptiles find different evolutionary paths in which to continue to advance?
