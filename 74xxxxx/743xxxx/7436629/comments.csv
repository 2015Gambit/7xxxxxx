Installed it to my main Kingdoms of Amulur folder; at the end of which it opened 3 webpages - first to AviaRa's page, then a gaming forum, then a Romanian commerce sit. When I try to run it I get a 'System Error: The program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer' although the main game runs fine. When I do run the game it still says ""Teeth of Naros"" is available for download still and there's nothing in the 'special deliveries chest' in Gorhart. I don't think the game recognized it. "

This goes for all ""Aviara"" torrents. "
