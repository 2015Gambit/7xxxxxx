Legend knows him as an archer of unwavering   
focus, the soldier who fought a battle in     
his own heart before taking up arms against   
his enemy. This is the untold story of Arjun, 
hero of the Mahabharata. A precocious talent  
plunged from boyhood and innocence into a     
murky world of deceit and betrayal, coming of 
age to become the most powerful warrior of his
time. From the dusty plains of Hastinapur to  
the icy peaks of the Himalayas, Arjun: The    
Warrior Prince is the story of a man          
discovering what it takes to be a hero.
