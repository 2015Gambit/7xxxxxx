Phantasy Star Portable is based on Phantasy Star Universe and its latest expansion, Ambition of the Illuminus. The PSP title includes an all-new story mode with added missions and a multi-player mode that supports local multiplayer cooperative play with up to four players. Two new characters have been introduced since Phantasy Star Universe: Vivienne, a CAST whom the main character teams up with throughout the story. Also new to the PSP version is Helga Neumann, a villain who is responsible for terrorist attacks in the Gurhal System.

A few months after the events of Phantasy Star Universe, the Gurhal Galaxy appears to be in peace until Vivienne, a new special CAST, and her partner discover remnant SEED are disturbing the peace. Vivienne and her partner go out to save the Gurhal System, and on the way, learn more about humanity.
