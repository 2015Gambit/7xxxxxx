READ NFO:
  The Battle for Middle-earth II v1.06
  
  I'll Remove all the protection that remain in the unpacked exe.
  
  Now you can copy the game folder anywhere you want, you just have 
  to run 'lotrbfme2-Reg.exe' again
  
  The nasty check that destroy your base after ~5min is also dead !
  
  And the last but not least, now you can play in LAN with other players.
  
  I Removed :
    CD Check, 
    CRC Checksum, 
    Serial Checksum, 
    Harddisk SID, 
    Computer SID, 
    Network CRC Check
    ...somes others ;)


note: first run take long time ~2min, due to user profile creation, 
next run are normal. The intro video has been removed.

  Have phun!
