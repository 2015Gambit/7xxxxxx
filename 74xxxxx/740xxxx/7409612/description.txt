For those of you who have enjoyed my other Mystery Collections and those contributed by other uploaders here we have a new collection from Shane Maloney.


Most are from CD, except #2 and #4 which are from tape. All are 48 kbps / 44 kHz Mono Fraunhofer CBR MP3.
Most are unabridged and read by Mike Bishop, except for #5 which is only available in abridged format and read by Tiriel Mora. 


Enjoy and Seed!!
