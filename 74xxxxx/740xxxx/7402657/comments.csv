If that does not work you can run the game with compatibility mode for Windows XP. If all else fails you can just simply wait through the white screens and then it will take you to the menu. The first time you run the game it forces you to play through these long movies."

Codecs didn't work, compatibility modes didn't do it, and idk how long the white screen is supposed to be up but I never got passed it. Got it to work by going into the ""bond"" folder then ""movies"" and just deleting all the files, booted right to the menu. Wont' have any cut scenes though."
