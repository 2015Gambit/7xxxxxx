,wegger,2012-07-03T08:20Z,"I copied the folder 'CLEAN' in Programs Files / Scania Truck Driving Simulator. I deleted the file 'bin'. Then I run the patch 1.1.0, to install it. And finally I copied the folder 'SKIDROW' in Programs Files / Scania Truck Driving Simulator.
 But the game does not work anymore.
 Can you explain me better. I do not understand"
