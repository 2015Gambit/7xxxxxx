,Emb170Capt,2012-07-02T03:28Z,"THIS IS GREAT!!! I do have a quick question however! I know I know.. ""Read the manual noob"" But maybe it can be quick to get a tip this way?  
Installation and all went smoothly, Fsx Starts and the software runs just fine (EZCA). I tried testing it out.. For i.e. the BE58. What I noticed is that the camera is fixed!!! Yes you see the effects and all, but if you trying moving your head around in the VC or even External views... it always resets itself in 2 seconds or so pointing straight ahead. How on earth is this fixable!? =/ "
,Emb170Capt,2012-07-02T03:34Z,"Oh, I dont use a joystick yet.. im sure its still workable?"
,world1p,2012-07-02T04:24Z,much waited for this.. Thanks really a lot...
,pluxi,2012-07-02T09:02Z,"Brilliant, works great... But why would you add a nag? Aren't we crackers supposed to hate nags? Anyway I'll get rid of it, but it's quite annoying to have to open up olly after downloading this. The only complaint!"
,SirWolfguar,2012-07-02T10:31Z,Thanks for download but how do I remove the nag
,atlas12,2012-07-02T15:55Z,"Wow, waited for this release forever. Thanks. Only ground service x remains uncrackable now. "

,Felidae17,2012-07-03T12:03Z,"The nag seems to bring an access violation by me when I am not quick enough to depress the OK button?? Ten or more error messages pop up, I've to remove one by one!"

,mickyfinnny,2012-07-03T22:02Z,"My stupid ip has banned tpb connection,but managed to logon through very helpful suggestions off suprbay,now just got to figure the uploading part.@
Emb170Capt,make sure you have edited the EXE.xml and not dll.xml"
,Emb170Capt,2012-07-04T03:41Z,"hey micky!, thx honestly for you assistance in tryin to help out! i appreciate it much :). Umm okay so I have to edit that exe.xml but what exactly do i have to edit in that to make sure the view doesnt always point to a fixed position every few seconds in flight !!

Thanks again :)"
,mickyfinnny,2012-07-04T10:53Z,"Backup your EXE.xml,add this line to it:

    EZdok camera addon
    false
    C:Program Files (x86)EZCAEZCALoader.exe

There is a readme file which explains the installation process in this dl,hope this helps."
,mickyfinnny,2012-07-04T10:56Z,Okay the translation hasnt come across properly{useless comments} Just copy and paste from the Readme file.
,godfitzham7,2012-07-04T23:32Z,"Don't get me wrong, I really do love this upload, and sometimes it may seem as if the trivial things upsets us but, this stupid 'nag' is truly a bother.
Does anyone here have a clue as to how this can be disabled ?? Thanks."
,godfitzham7,2012-07-10T17:00Z,"Hey pluxi, I noted in your comment that you said you can get rid of the nag; how do you do so ? Please share your info. Much appreciated."
,kais17,2012-07-15T02:30Z,"Thank you for this share,i have been waiting for this upload since long time."
,FieroGT,2012-08-06T21:26Z,"ok, so how we get rid of the stupid nag???????
i figure it must be in one of the 2 crack files... ?"
,M.D.T.,2012-08-12T20:01Z,Have a problem here. I cannot configure the cameras as they always turn into the default settings when i switch its. Any ideas?
