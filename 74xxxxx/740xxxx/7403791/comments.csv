,Itchiga,2012-07-01T21:53Z,Why it have another 20 mb? is it unpacked? 
,NexiumCore,2012-07-01T22:04Z,"Nope, its archived."
,NexiumCore,2012-07-01T23:17Z,"I downloaded this directly from the source about 2 minutes before uploading, so it might be a bit newer. That would explain the larger size."
,Donkeyboner,2012-07-04T14:51Z,"i downloaded it, and it works fine! scary game, tho"
,Killer3474,2012-07-08T06:29Z,Works great. I only wish my computer was faster and didn't have an implemented GPU.
[T],swebarb,2012-07-09T21:11Z,virus?
,L0RDFR3NCHY,2012-07-10T16:18Z,thank you
,Killer3474,2012-07-11T02:49Z,@swebarb It checked out on my virus scanner. Did it crash or something on your end?
,VitorCz,2012-07-14T23:00Z,"lol you can't find this game on internet anymore, only in TPB"
,v3gard1,2012-07-15T03:08Z,"Thank you so much, the torrent works great!"
,NexiumCore,2012-07-18T19:09Z,Am i the only one that almost shit their pants when they turned a corner or turned around and saw the slenderman? 
,foxeiy,2012-08-01T04:59Z,"@VictorCz

You obviously don't know how to find things on the internet properly"
,zac8679,2012-08-01T07:29Z,um this game is free just google slender and it will let u download it 
,numb1zero,2012-08-06T00:38Z,"thanks for the upload, nexiumcore"
,T-R3X,2012-08-07T10:41Z,"@zac8679 I don't think you understand the point for people putting this on here. Yes it is free to download, but the reason why its on here:

Downloading from the website takes too long. When you have peers helping seed it, you download a lot faster, Saving time. This is why I love P2P"
,NyanKitty,2012-08-21T10:55Z,LOL. There are 666 seeders! 666? Get it?
,noobvisibleninja,2012-08-27T17:05Z,@NyanKitty EVIL!!! XD seeing your username I think you like internet memes?? :D
,Sploder,2012-08-31T15:45Z,"This game made me shit so many bricks the first time round. Now its just a bit boring, whenever I see him I'm just like ""hey dude hows it goin brah?""

He never replies though......"
,Sploder,2012-08-31T16:04Z,"Also this version of the game is far better than the newer ones: ur flashlight drops when you run etc. 

Will seed 4eva"
,nearbrute,2012-09-02T00:00Z,omg dude freeking scariest game ever 
,theswagpirate,2012-09-03T19:17Z,Great upload NexiumCore! Love the game and it is a badass one. If only I had a gaming computer that dosent have that much lag :(
,miguel0914,2012-09-07T02:13Z,So boring. Of the 3 times I played this game I only saw Slender when the music starting getting louder and he just turned my player around and made me lose and stare at his polygon face. But this game has potential to be made into something completed and more modern.
,mr_z_rocky,2012-09-12T13:17Z,This is a FREE Game Everywhere !!!
