omfg hahahahahah seriously? SERIOUSLY?

[V],psspss,2012-07-02T09:39Z,"as stated in ep2 already
==

anyone with a interest in UFO watches.. over 1300 download this episode so far

its entertaining if anything.. i think it gets better
roswell one they find something.

we lack current shows .news on UFOs.. so anything is better then nothing.
if ratings are poor their wont be any more
so they need usa support

I still say ufo hunters and mufon should do their own shows with investigations and share them
freely on p2p and ask for donations or sell merchandise to support it.. fans will support them to keep it going.. having to rely on discy and hist chan editing is bad news and pulling shows

as he said in the interview on other ufo torrent above they hope its popular so next season they  get to edit the episodes their way

plus as usual people dont give a shit about your opinions here :) "
[V],psspss,2012-07-02T09:41Z,"and stop -1 rating my uploads..

its for quality not what you think of the content"
,cinemaniac905,2012-07-02T15:15Z,this is not better than nothing...this far far worse than nothing.
,carrigart140,2012-07-14T20:13Z,+1 for super quality
