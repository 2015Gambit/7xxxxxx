If you like it you should also try SCP containment breach, if you havent already. I could play Amnesia all the way through to the end and, but i cant handle that game for more than ten minutes or so without feeling like im going to have a heart attack.

By the way Maverick, thanks for posting this, the creator's site seems to be down so this might be the only place to get it for a while."

Played game. Crapped self. Going to find a puppy and play with it so slenderman doesn't haunt my dreams (And change pants)."
