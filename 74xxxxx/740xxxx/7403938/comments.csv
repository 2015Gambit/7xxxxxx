,johnniebrasco1,2012-07-02T01:42Z,"hmmm. why is that? not that i use that client, but how is it affecting you? why should you care what client people are using?"
,atomicBS,2012-07-02T01:50Z,@johnniebrasco1 Because using those programs may cause intense leeching and choked peers and I want everyone to get my torrent the fastest way possible so I don't want people who use programs who just leech and don't seed.

i got a 24 mb fiber optic con and its only going at about 5 - 10 kbs

,atomicBS,2012-07-02T10:40Z,"@Beowulf6666 Well I don't use seedbox yet (don't have a job, yet) and why don't you check those guys who have the most % than all If you did you would have seen that they have the best download speed bcoz they ""suck"" all the upload available in the swarm and by then you shouldn't be complaining about it. As soon as they finish you will have your turn to a higher download speed. Thanks for your patience."
