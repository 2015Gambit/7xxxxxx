ABOUT

A lot of ECG girls cannot come out of their State to visit me so I sometimes have to go to them, and our little ECG whore this week is from beautiful San Diego, California! I think every guy, and girl, would love to have this girls sexual experiences. I know I would have loved too! At only 18 years of age, Amber has had more experiences that could be in Penthouse Forum than any other girl I have exploited to date. This girl looks like a wholesome flower, but wouldnâ™t you just love to have her as the neighborâ™s daughter!
This girl is so innocent and enjoys sex so much, I almost felt guilty for what I was about to put her through! LOL! Although she has had lots, and I mean LOTS of hot, naughty, and oh sooooo illegal sex! (U just have to watch the video to find out), she was still a novice little grad school girl when she walked through my hotel room door. It was so cute how she got a little embarrassed after she orgasmed while I was fucking her and again when I licked her pussy. Those were cute embarrassments.
Its nothing like the embarrassment she will feel when her school faculty and / or friends from class see her videos on ECG! And after I blew my load all over that pretty little face of hers, I asked how her 1st video shoot was, and she muttered, “it wasssssss…. Different” LOL!!! Well this girl is a lot different than her appearance. There is just so much about this girl that is surprising that you just have to hear it from her. So make sure to watch her BTS video and get to know this week's little college whore! Cheers, Steve
