QED 21 - Electrical ENERGY

The equilateral geometry behind Electrical Energy as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Building from a simple geometric premise the geometry of all the Electrical units are developed from geometry of Planck quanta

Maxwell, Gauss, Ampere, Faraday and Joule and their laws are revealed as equilateral geometries and the motive force behind electricity is revealed

The twenty-first chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia
