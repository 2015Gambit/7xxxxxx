,creative_expansion,2012-07-04T01:17Z,is this the entire game u can play for free on steam? or different? i believe this game has 5 chapters but not positive
,creative_expansion,2012-07-04T01:26Z,"sorry I'm an idiot i thought u could play all chapters free, how do i unlock four and five?"
,zombird,2012-07-04T06:03Z,"creative_expansion, this only includes the first three chapters. So either they're not out yet, or the uploader only has the first three. "
,creative_expansion,2012-07-04T07:39Z,oh i see thanks man
,creative_expansion,2012-07-04T07:39Z,cool game so far!
,WinterGale,2012-07-04T11:05Z,"I checked the Steam store, the fourth and fifth chapters aren't out yet."
,creative_expansion,2012-07-04T13:48Z,"cool game WinterGale. I'm glad to see u on here more n more lately, everything u upload runs so smooth on my macbook, thank u, I'm kind of hooked lol u think u may be able to get the next few chapters after they are released? i love that u have the more obscure indie games thats what i love playing! thanks again love!"
,mattchoi365,2012-07-19T21:11Z,Very good game! I really like it WinterGale! However there is one problem. You need to upload chapters 4 and 5! I mean I finished your game and I need these two more chapters. Write back!

,coffeybreak1,2012-08-06T21:31Z,Yes please make this to pc! I love this game!
