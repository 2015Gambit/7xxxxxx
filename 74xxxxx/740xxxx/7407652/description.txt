QED 29 - Absorption~Emission lines

The equilateral geometry behind Spectral lines as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The geometry behind RydbergΓÇÖs formula and constant is revealed along with its relationship to electron wavenumbers and relativistic Lorentz corrections of the [K]EM fields of electrons in motion.

All of the Hydrogen spectral lines can now be easily explained as a function stemming from the geometry of equilateral energy momenta 

The twenty-ninth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
