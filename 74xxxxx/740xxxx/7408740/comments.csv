,jsaucy11,2012-07-04T04:15Z,"It is beyond me why you would do this? If you are a Christian who hates pornography, then don't watch the show. People who censor other people's vision, words or other content should find out what it feels like to have tape strapped to their mouth and hog tied so they can feel that for a little while.

You have no right to modify someone's artistic vision because you are offended. It's called Freedom, and if you understood the concept even a little you might understand why its wrong.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, If you want to see Game of Thrones watch it the way it was intended to be seen. If you don't like seeing people naked, umm go live in a cave by yourself forever and hope to never have children.

There is no pornography in Game of Thrones, its called Sex, and not only is it suggested or simulated, its done so poorly its not even jerk-worthy material.

Any asshat who would edit such a masterpiece of  work like this has a serious screw loose. You must be one of those douchenozzles who enjoys editing classic books written hundreds of years ago just to remove anything you don't like, or one of those idiots who only buys music from walmart because its been sanitized. You're a useless piece of garbage and everything that is wrong with freedom."
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-04T06:14Z,"You seem very closed-minded. People are entitled to their own opinions and just because you don't care about nudity or sex in your shows, doesn't mean you need to impose your view on everyone else. I'm not imposing mine.

I'm also, not ruining anyone's artistic vision. The sex adds nothing to the show, and even if it did, this is a simple torrent that isn't being imposed on anyone. If it was censored on television, and the author was forced to cut parts of their show, then perhaps your argument would hold true.

The definition of freedom, is people are free to have their own views. Let people enjoy media the way they want to. If I don't like parts of a show, I can enjoy it without them. I do the same for music. Lot's of times, they'll be a great song, and it just happens to have some random screaming in it, which gives me a headache. Why shouldn't I be allowed to enjoy media the way I want?

Lastly, this was made for personal use. I have many friends who kept hearing how great the show was, but don't appreciate all the sex. I made it so they can enjoy the show as well.

Stop trying to impose your beliefs on other people. "
,jsaucy11,2012-07-08T11:54Z,"You contend that the sex adds nothing to the story but of course you'd be wrong. Sex is a very real part of life, and season one or book one: Game of Thrones, sex is responsible for most of the bad events that transpire throughout. 

For instance the incident with Bran, Cersi, and Jaime in the tower. 

The sex between Drogo and Dany, another instance of importance to the characters and events of the series.

The sex between the king and his mistresses, a very important part of the story, again.

The sex between the imp and his whore, also important for establishing the events that transpire in season2/book2

Sex is a very real part of life without it you wouldn't be here to edit this content at all. Your idea that freedom means you can just edit whatever you like to suit your needs is wrong. That isn't freedom, it's censorship, the very opposite of freedom. Freedom is accepting something as it was intended. While its easy to suggest that freedom can apply both ways understand that if such were true you could walk around destroying just about anything you don't like, claiming you have the freedom to do so. It doesn't work like that.

See the difference between what the original author does and what you do is NIGHT AND DAY. You see the original author has the freedom to reshape his words or story to fit the events that unfold. You don't have that option, the only option you have is to cut, and that is censorship.

Next time you try to give someone a lesson on freedom, first try and actually understand what it means. 

Also what kind of friends do you have that don't appreciate sex? I mean seriously? WTF does that even mean? Who the fuck doesn't appreciate sex? You need some friends other than the 12 year olds you hang out with, or you need to find some friends who want to actually have children one day instead of sitting around in their PJs telling scary stories and asking their parents to tell them how the stork brought them into this world."
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-08T19:01Z,"Well, what I meant was the sex scenes them self added nothing, but having watched the show, I know it's important to know that sex is going on, it just isn't shown in this edited version. By editing it intelligently, anyone viewing will know what is happening, and know that characters had sex, if it was important for them to know, so that isn't an issue.

Also, like I said, me editing this for my needs is practicing my freedom. It's not being imposed on anyone. People have the freedom to watch it in unedited. By uploading this, I'm giving them another option. I'm not destroying the other option. 

""Freedom is accepting something as it was intended.""? I think you would disagree with this if you thought about it more.

If I but a table, and trim the legs down, since I thought they were too high, did I ruin the artistic vision of the person who made it?

If I buy a sandwich, and remove some ingredients I don't like, am I not enjoying it as it was intended to be enjoyed by the cook?

This is no different. I am not demanding that everyone needs to cut their tables down, or remove ingredients from their sandwich. I'm not restricting anyone's freedom, I'm giving them more freedom to choose.

Also, of course people who would want it censored don't hate sex or the naked body. They just don't want to see people other people have sex, and other people other than their spouses naked bodies for entertainment purposes. You can let the audience know that people are having sex without showing it. Not everyone likes watching others have sex.

So, why do you care how people enjoy things in their own privacy? "
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-09T17:23Z,"Guys, I've seeded 60GB of this so far, and I'm still the only seed. My internet connection has a cap, and I'm seeding from a laptop that moves with me, so I'm not always available to seed. If you guys don't start seeding, when I have to stop this torrent will die, and the 26gb one that has the one episode as 10gb will have to be the one people use.

So, basically, everyone will have to download 10 more gb then they should if they download the old one, so seed this one, because I'm not going to be able to seed it forever."
,Random.,2012-07-11T00:33Z,"Thank you for this. Even though I have seen both seasons uncensored, It would be nice to have this.
Don't pay attention to that guy, please. Downloading S02E02 to see how you did it. I guess this ""Fix2"" in name is confusing people."
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-12T05:50Z,"Sorry, fix2 is since I uploaded it once with a mistake, and this is the fixed version. Let me know what you think, this is my first time attempting anything like this, so any feedback is appreciated. "
,Random.,2012-07-12T16:44Z,"Season 2 episode 2 - 40:56.

Cut is too ""violent"". Imply that sex scene is coming but don't show it. Cut when she begins to take her clothes off. You could do ""fade to black"" with music being silenced at the same time.

Otherwise, good. Nice job with Greyjoys riding a horse. Nice job with Greyjoy in a boat cabin. Boy, that Greyjoy guy gave you many headaches, didn't he?"
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-12T16:55Z,"Yeah, he seems to have sex all the time for no reason. Not really any story during these. I thought ""giving yourself to the lord of light"" may be enough, but your right, it is to 'violent'. I'll do the edits you suggested and re-upload that episode. Please give more suggestions if you find problems with other episodes."
,NonNativeHawaiian808,2012-07-20T20:19Z,"Hey Flame_Leg, I made this temporary email to get your true one so we can email back and forth.  It will be up for a week (so I will get a week of spam)
C1I6DeKYLxWwuWYm@ unpentant. trillianpro. com

I've added spaces in the temporary email.

I absolutely support what you're doing and want to offer my 30Mb pipe to help seed (besides just normal seeding)."
,dumonttt,2012-08-27T03:24Z,"please some one seeeeeeed! :( its taking 3 days per episode thats a killer....
