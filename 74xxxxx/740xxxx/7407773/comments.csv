,derce927,2012-07-03T06:25Z,says there are 18 seeders and 43 peers. cant ever connect to a completed seeder. dont know why we all have to go 1 percent at a time. will take hours. are you just making copies and seeding at a set amount of like 10kb a second?
,derce927,2012-07-03T06:27Z,if you let people download the entire video they would seed and put less download pressure on you. i also seed for 24 hours automatically after i finish my downloads.
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T06:55Z,"a few shows collect faker seeders or antip2p

hence why you should be blocking them with peer block and level 1 ips so they wont appear int he client

also vpn is wise.. should use both together
even if peer block dont hide ip it blocks the nobs"
,derce927,2012-07-03T07:03Z,"i know what vpn is. i used that on my seedbox when i had it but dont now.

that to keep anonymous?

what is peer block and level 1 ips? i use vuze azureus. are these softwares or something you pay monthly for subscription?"
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T07:07Z,"now utorrent says 2 seeders but stats here say 58

I can tell you its only me still 57 are bad

and its onyl down like 20 perent.. will speed up when other more popular torrents seed out.. got limited upload speed "
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T07:10Z,"peer block is system where people report media and lawyer spies and you load them into the tool
to block the connections with you.. wont hide your ip
but stops them collecting info or sharing bad blocks
slowing it all down

google peer block.. read up on it..

but you should always use a vpn now in a non usa country else you migth get a isp letter

always use max security.. 

of course most soft is windows only.. "
,derce927,2012-07-03T07:17Z,how do i add beer block and level 1 ips to my computer and azureus? i did some google searches for info but most looks years old. should i use software like peer guardian or bluetack?
,derce927,2012-07-03T07:21Z,"my upload speed is maxed out at 125 kb a second. thats why i had a seedbox for months and helped my ratio on scenetime.com, got my ratio up to 12.3. are these free or paid softwares? or a monthly fee subscription? so outside the united states its more of a risk? thought it wasnt safe in the US!?"
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T07:37Z,"peer guardian 2 will work also.. but its old
it blocks.. it dont need to be updated.. the soft works
however it needs a rewrite to work with win 7 and 8

but now peer block taking it over.. its less advance though

you only update the ip lists it blocks

,BaronCurb,2012-07-04T00:49Z,"Always great uploads! Sorry I haven't gotten around to downloading anything til now, will seed for the usual ratio minimum, but since its your torrent, i'll leave it on overnight. Thanks, and again for the following!"
,Pendaws,2012-07-04T02:01Z,Thanks.
[V],psspss,2012-07-04T04:39Z,"alas my isp called today and want to reduce my data cap while charging me more.. so I will have to cut back sharing sadly

means everyone will suffer I think asi I have to share
only select stuff

lets hope afg keeps adding xvids.. they very slow adding though I notice"
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-05T03:59Z,You can cut back on this show and keep the UFO/Alien stuff coming ;)
