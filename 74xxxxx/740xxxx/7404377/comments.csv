,LymphN0de,2012-07-04T00:21Z,So this is an English version? I have Fatal Frame 4 and modded the ISO with English translation subtitles. This has English voices?
,LymphN0de,2012-07-04T00:28Z,Oh I forgot to mention I'll be testing it on a console with uLoader on Wii version 4.3U. If you would like I can post if it works or not. Kinda slow downloading so you might be able to test it before I do but just to let you know ;)
,fenixstorm,2012-07-04T01:11Z,would seeders be good :
,truemaster,2012-07-04T14:28Z,yes is english voice and subtitles yes if you test it coment back we want coments so others can trust and download this torrent 
,proudzecu,2012-07-04T20:15Z,Please people seed :(
,LymphN0de,2012-07-04T22:10Z,Yes this works on softmod wii version 4.3U in uLoader. Don't forget you may need the hd cables cause it's pal if your on an US wii.
,truemaster,2012-07-05T14:22Z,works for me to my wii is pal 4.2e softmoded usb loader gx
,truemaster,2012-07-05T15:52Z,to some impatience idiot people i just see coments in my utorrent and people said i upload slow let me clear some things iam and i live in greece. greece telecomunications are slow my upload speed is max 115kbs  do you realy people beleve that i like the fact that i need one day full to upload this: no i wish i could do faster but i cant. atn least their are a lot of seeders now that can upload  fast so others can dl faster one more thing dont complain for things you take for free 
,LymphN0de,2012-07-06T00:39Z,"You are absolutely right truemaster. I got it in about a day which is good. And yes people cannot bitch for something they're getting for free. I'm seeding plenty, so far I've uploaded 2.19 gigs so they shouldn't be complaining. They must be a bunch of impatient kids who want it right now. 

Don't worry about them man, you at lease have one person who understands and is on your side ;). Also I've left my laptop on for almost 2 days to seed this and yet they complain there are no seeders. And I bet the ones complaining are going to download and not share back."
,truemaster,2012-07-06T14:26Z,thank you LymphN0de and youre right too about those impatience people after they complete their download they always stop seed selfish stuborn kids
,omegaweapon2008,2012-07-21T03:49Z,"If I download this torrent, can I play it on my wii US version using homebrew channel?"
,truemaster,2012-07-21T06:28Z,yes you can usb loader doesnt care about region
,shinigamiinochi,2012-07-23T21:05Z,"I downloaded this torrent, but when I try to open it, it asks for a password for some reason. "
,truemaster,2012-07-24T01:41Z,password???? how can this possible this is uncompresed iso. are you try to extract it? no need to extract. burn and play if your wii is chiped. copy it on your hard drive if youre softmoded
,shinigamiinochi,2012-07-24T06:32Z,"I don't really know which one we have. I do have the fatal frame 4 download on a flash drive, with the homebrew channel and the usb loader to play ff4. I don't really know what to do here because it won't let me transfer the file to a flash drive and my roommate says that burning the dvd probably won't work. What would you suggest? Sorry, I'm really not good with tech stuff. "
,truemaster,2012-07-24T14:39Z,i play it via usb loader gx my hard drive is formated with wbfs manager and the wbfs manager is what i used for transfering the file the file is in iso format. thats why i tell before no way about pasword i have also beat the game
,shinigamiinochi,2012-07-25T04:34Z,"I downloaded the manager as suggested and tried to format my flash drive, but it keeps saying that an error has occurred. "
,truemaster,2012-07-25T16:36Z,not all flash drives are compatible whith wbfs manafer or wii usb loader gx check compatibility list
