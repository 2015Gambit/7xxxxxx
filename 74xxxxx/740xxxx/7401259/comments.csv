,Skyknows,2012-06-30T19:57Z,"Tried all the other torrents but all are sh*t, Can't wait for RELOADED release any longer so i'll be trying this out. Can someone confirm this release? are all the files there?"
,nipunb,2012-06-30T20:02Z,"hmmm... why everyone is uploading both episodes in a single archive, most of us already have the 1st episode and its a waste of bandwidth to download it again...."

,xxela,2012-07-01T09:40Z,"@henre
 So you can play from Ep 2  with old savings if you already finished Ep1 ?"
,Stefanovics,2012-07-01T11:18Z,"It works, but to USE the old SAVES you must see that are now 2 FOLDERS in the Telltale Games folder, one is where your saves are
The Walking Dead
and one where the NEW installer PUT this game SAVES in, The.Walking.Dead
i just copied the saves from one folder to another, and presto the game found them."
,MrAssistance,2012-07-01T12:51Z,"Great job, pal. I forgot to bring the 1st episode from my former PC. So this 2 game in 1 surelly did alot for me :)
