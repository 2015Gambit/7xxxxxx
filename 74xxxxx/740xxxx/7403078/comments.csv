,dougcanpwn,2012-07-01T23:30Z,when i type FC over 100 results come up.
,dougcanpwn,2012-07-02T00:02Z,Gibberish instructions. 
,dougcanpwn,2012-07-02T00:03Z,Ive done everything you said. too many results and none are connected to uniblue. just random strings and values with the word FC in them.
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-07-02T02:51Z,And why didnt you just make the necessary .reg file and include it in the torrent ? Thats just pathetic. it does NOT work
,gt4steve,2012-07-02T11:09Z,"MANY thanks for the upload, but I cannot work out what the 'Click 2x FC' step is.  ????  )-;  Please help someone, maybe had a beer too many??"

,dougcanpwn,2012-07-03T23:40Z,"ok people i got it to work.
make sure only value is checked and also check match whole string only.
make sure uniblue is fully closed. (exit in tray icon)
good luck"
,seanpb,2012-07-07T10:01Z,Works great...Thanks
,gask8,2012-07-11T14:40Z,"   worked for me, just followed the instructions and bingo! 
   I realised that you can do the procedure even before you install the program, it will work the same way.
   thanx dude"
,Bonnev,2012-07-15T12:11Z,"Yeah, nothing hard. Just when you're searching with Ctrl+F in the regedit you have to check ""Mach whole string only"" and ever if you check all of the above boxes you will still find it easily. And when you put the new string with the name ""Licence"" you put the value PS-FAQ2S-KCVE7-3JWEA-YNUK5-X57S9-D25YZ and that's it. The program must be closed and when you're finished here, just close regedit and open the program. In the Overview says ""REGISTERED"""

,mikepuff,2012-09-01T05:27Z,"Folks, I've done everything the instructions say. As of 8-27-2012 this serial does not work."
,mikepuff,2012-09-01T05:49Z,"Use the 2009 version. It's the same program, without MicroGreed blocking all the serials. https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7328902/Uniblue_Registry_Booster_2009_-_velvetfog
