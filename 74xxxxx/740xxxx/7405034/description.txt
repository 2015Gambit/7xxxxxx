I finally found a source for the 3.4.1 version of datamaster EE. I applied the crack to the EXE already, and originally this only works on XP.

The unique thing about this version is I have made it work with Windows 7 as well.
On Windows 7, it will give a notification about something on start, but otherwise this program is good to go.

Instructions:

1) Download
2) Run the program! Already cracked =)

I have included 6 runs of my cammed LT1/T56 vehicle that were recorded using the NEWEST version of datmaaster EE just for reference. I was curious to see if it really read them with this older version.

Feel free to read the note to the developers.

If you are a developer, no hard feelings. I just don't agree with what you are doing to people.
