[T],SecTPB,2012-07-02T04:28Z,"There are a lot of fakes out there tonight, guys. Be careful what you are downloading and stay safe. Watch out for .rar files. I think I have the only legit copy right now and it's a TS. You'll have to wait a while I guess for some SD or 720p releases."
[T],SecTPB,2012-07-02T04:29Z,Lol. And there are also trolls like that guy who did the first post on my torrent here. (See above).

[T],SecTPB,2012-07-02T04:48Z,"Well, if you don't want my actual TS of this episode, you'll have to wait for an encode of it. 4GB more or less is about the normal size of a one hour broadcast before encoded. It's ""as seen on TV"" basically. 

And anything that says fake or whatever, just ignore. Look at the files or my history. You're safe, don't worry."

,kathrynobvious,2012-07-02T04:57Z,If you'll look at the other torrents this user has uploaded (and the comments on them) looks pretty legit to me.

TS = Transport Stream. 
Transport Stream is a container that holds the actual video and audio streams of a broadcast on any TV. It is uncompressed and used as a base for encoders to use to make the releases you normally see. Basically, it's exactly what was on my TV when I watched it."

,theshape31,2012-07-02T05:15Z,"I simply cannot believe how many fools don't realize that this is a legit release.  It's full 1080p, so it's going to be bigger than the 720p release (that's also a hefty 2.5GB).  And look at SecTPB's other uploads, how could you think he's a spammer?  If you want scaled-down quality, just wait a little bit.  Darned kids..."

,drummerpunk7,2012-07-02T05:23Z,"unless you are uploading this at 2+Mbps then it is a wasted effort. No one wants  to wait 10 hours for a 1 hour show.

1 hour shows should take 15 minutes to download. maybe 30 if it's HD.

And who the hell telesyncs TV?"
,theshape31,2012-07-02T05:35Z,"drummerpunk7-
Look at how many peers are on this torrent.  There are plenty of people that would be happy to wait as long as it takes to download, myself included.  I won't have time to watch it until tomorrow, anyway.

And I don't mind that it's a telesync.  If you don't like what's being offered go somewhere else, and stop trying to speak for other people."

People also need to start reading previous comments.

TS stands for Transport Stream.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_stream

This is unaltered, original, raw video and audio stream as shown on TV. Basically, there's no higher quality than this because this is the actual stream broadcasted onto TV.

TS is user friendly. The fact that it's 1080i (The 'i' meaning ""Interlaced"") means you need to simply use a player with a built-in Deinterlacer. Media Player Classic Home Cinema does it automatically. VLC deinterlacing can be enabled in its ""Video"" option(Use ""Yadif"" option).

This is what rippers use to encode the files you normally see. This is the source.

They're simply, again, losers who must live out in the sticks and have truly crappy internet and cannot fathom downloading a 4 gig file which, for me, takes on average about 30-35 minutes. Totally worth it given the quality involved. For those of us who know and appreciate the difference between 720p and 1080p, your efforts are appreciated. To the losers talking shit, PLEASE just shut the hell up. This is a real download meant for people with very fast internet. If you don't qualify, be quiet and move your ignorant ass on."
