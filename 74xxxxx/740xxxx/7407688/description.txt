QED 31 - Balmer Spectral lines

The equilateral geometry behind the Balmer spectral series as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The equilateral geometry that dictates the specific energies relating to Balmer spectral series lines is revealed.

The specific energies required to achieve electron transitions in Hydrogen nuclei are explained in terms of their Tetryonic geometry, along with the revelation of how the Math reflects the Tetryonic geometry of the associated KEM fields of the electrons.

The thirty-first chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
