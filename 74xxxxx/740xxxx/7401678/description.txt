Hi. We are out of Hartland, MI, a band called Mizmazduh. You could say this was our first EP. Recorded in Winter 2011 - early spring 2012. Our band's members have changed since then and we are a different group now, performing under the same name.

1 - "Paris on a Paper Plate" [27.36] (Barbee, Oxley, Ward) 
2 - "Aspirations" [4.37] (Gess, Ward) 
3 - "I Get Sleep When I'm Bored" [30.56] (Gess, Gogiashvili, Oxley, Ward)

Despite this record being called "Greatest Hits", it is no such thing.

Tracks One and Three are long, completely spontaneous jam-wankery. Tedious at parts, bizarre at parts, boring at parts, kickass at parts I think honestly. Track Two is a cover of The Bicycle Thief song of the same name.

Good music to blaze/trip trip.

Why are we distributing our music for free?

Cuz we can



Namaste
