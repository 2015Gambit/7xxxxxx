ReleaseNotes:

Just like Black Sabbath is the founding fathers of modern rock, Marvin Gaye is one of the founding fathers of Rap/Hip-Hop/Pop. Sure, performers before him where writing and singing of the same things that he was, that was what the jazz/blues movement is all about. Marvin Gaye gave mainstream acceptance to a sound that might have never come to light without him.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.
HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.
We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!

Hey! RIAA snitcher David Brooks from Devon. What did you tell them?
That HHI is dropping rips like LSD? Call us crazy...We think they might already know that. Didn't your parents ever teach you that it's not nice to snitch? Especially when the people you try and snitch on can figure out who you are. Here's our doc drop dedicated to you. We're sure the information looks familiar, as it's yours.
