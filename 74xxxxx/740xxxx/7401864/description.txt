Parkway Drive's killer live performance @ Festival Hall, Melbourne Australa on September 29th, 2010. 

The show was an incredible one. Whist it's good that Parkway got coverage on national tv, I don't believe the production team behind the audio/video did the gig justice. It's lacking in something special. But what footage ever captures the feeling of a live show?

Converted from .TS file that I ripped straight from TV. I used Handbrake to covert the file and it it turned out wonderfully for the size. Basically identical to the original quality.
