Requirements: Android 1.6 +
Overview: Official Build. For more details see  
http://www.scummvm.org


ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

ScummVM supports many adventure games, including LucasArts SCUMM games (such as Monkey Island 1-3, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, ...), many of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (such as King's Quest 1-6, Space Quest 1-5, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword 1 and 2, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of Kyrandia 1-3, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more. 



NOTE : RAR Archive contains ScummVM Emulator APK + Plugins APK, start installing emulator then plugins you need.

PS : Iwanted to upload Monkey Island trilogy (and maybe other games) but realised (by the moment I test them) that they're all french version only :/ Must of them are CD versions. I suppose that it's not really usefull to post games only in French...
