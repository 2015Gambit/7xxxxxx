HP Media Smart Server EX470 and EX475 OEM Recovery Disc v1.1
------------------------------------------------------------

Since HP has discontinued any support what-so-ever for the Media Smart EX-47x series Home Servers, I had to find this file to get my EX-470 going again and thought I would upload it for anyone else with a EX470 or EX475 server in the same situation.

This can be run from an ISO Loader such as Alcohol 52% or Daemon Tools. You have to use a 32bit OS for it to correctly interface and recover the Media Smart Server. After it is recovered, do all the system downloads and then you will be able to use a 64bit OS to access the server.
