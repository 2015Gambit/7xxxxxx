Wow this has to be the shortest Weeds episode ever.  I'm extremely disappointed in the length of this episode."
,eb121209,2012-07-03T09:17Z,"Hey eddy and kingda, are you two morons? This episode is the same length as every episode. Look up ""weeds"" on imdb, it says they are 30 minutes long, minus the ads will be around 26 minutes."
,nuggz503,2012-07-04T09:04Z,You are beautiful. Thank you!!
,kingda74,2012-07-05T08:31Z,"Hey eb121209 get off our dicks.  Weeds was a hour long show on Showtime but I guess you wouldn't know that having caught every episode on the TV Guide channel.  Those are 30 minutes because they are edited.  The edited version of this episode is probably like 14 minutes or so.  So next time you have ASS on your face, remember it don't come off!  Fuck you and have a nice day"

Weeds is a 30 minute show.
A 30 minute TV episode is typically around 21 - 22 minutes long when the commercials are removed.
The Weeds episodes are actually a bit longer than that, at 26 minutes.

When weeds first came out, it was an hour long episode on Showtime, it might be 21 minutes long now but when this show first came out it was a hour long"
,MaGicbush,2012-07-08T07:05Z,"@ kingda74:

Wrong, every episode of Weeks has been 30 minutes. I have all seasons on file and all of them range from 25-29 minutes long..."
,MaGicbush,2012-07-08T07:06Z,"Grr how how you cannot edit comments on this site, has to be the only site I post on you cannot.. But meant ""Weeds"" not ""weeks."""
,MaGicbush,2012-07-08T07:07Z,"Grr Hate you can't edit comments on this site, my one gripe with TPB. I meant ""Weeds"" not ""weeks."""
,MaGicbush,2012-07-08T07:09Z,"And now it double posted even though the first reply I made never showed up, add a damn edit feature to the comment please!"
,MaGicbush,2012-07-08T07:13Z,"@ kingda74:

This maybe a 5th post because TPB keeps acting wierd, I tried editing but apparently you cannot here which is the only site I have posted on which you cannot. Now the other posts I made disappeared, so a final post...

Weeds has had 30 minute episodes since the first season. I have them all on file, if you don't believe us it's easy to see this by checking out a Season 1 episode on TPB being 100mb or less... Stop posting crap you obviously have no clue about please."
