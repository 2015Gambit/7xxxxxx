This is the Soviet Red Bear compilation book. I did not make this pdf and still havn't found a torrent for it so I am releasing it since the v1.2 release of all the books doesn't have this one. Thanks to the guy releasing the big release as I still need Grey Wolf!

Someone please do BG&G and Devil's Charge!

This is my first torrent and I have no idea what I'm doing. I will seed with maximum upload and just see how this goes.
