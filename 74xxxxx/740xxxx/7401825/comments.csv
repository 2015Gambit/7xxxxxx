,bob-420,2012-07-01T19:44Z,"Fuck off Namorax, you douche.  The budget for the original Paranormal activity was 15,000...fifteen thousand! and it grossed almost 200 million.  The only reasons that a films' budget is high, is if there are the typical A-list assholes in it and they need their 10-20 million a movie, all the special effects, whose companies charge exorbitant rates averaging out to around 2 grand or more per hour.  Take Avatar for example.  Like 10 percent of that movie was real...maybe less, and the budget was like 250,000,000.   "
,Flamestrike,2012-07-01T20:29Z,the acting in this movie is horrible
,Gear27,2012-07-01T20:49Z,"3.2 in IMDB, don't waste your time."

,Namorax,2012-07-01T23:07Z,"Actually a better example of a low budget quality film is El Mariachi, Robert Rodriguez first film. Thats a masterpiece that he originally shot for $7000, and then the studios polished up with another 200k or so. But for 200k he launched a franchise, and a major career, and is pioneering the Digital and 3D technology in film today."

,armchair.53,2012-07-02T05:21Z,"so i take it that some people believe that the quality of the movie = its budget.  Personally, the standard I use is whether or not I liked it."

,hatepig,2012-07-04T10:23Z,@bob-420: you justify a movie's quality by what money it makes? Fucking pathetic. Get the fuck out of here with that shit.
,hippiekiller1977,2012-07-05T11:20Z,"this is the worst movie I'v ever seen. and iÂ´v seen some pretty bad movies.
