I would reinstall windows but I got to much stuff I do not have space to back up.   "
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-07-03T22:24Z,Hmm it looks like if i move very slowly at the character select screen w/o my wireless xbox 360 controller I can do it but if I use my controller and go straight through all the people to Ryder white it crashes and reboots my PC

,zero1zero,2012-07-23T23:21Z,Is the Ryder White campaign incomplete? It doesn't play the intro movie after you start a new game with him. It just gives a blank screen. I'm wondering if any other videos are missing from it.
,Capt.Bay,2012-07-24T02:17Z,"Why is there no souuund??? plzz heelpp, everything is perfect except the sound plz i need help"

,Maselli,2012-07-27T07:57Z,"The game runs fine but I have a problem, when I try to access the arena, it takes me straight to the main menu.  Is there something I'm not doing or is there something I should fix in the game folder, thanks"
,MISTAH1N1,2012-07-27T18:24Z,"Guys I have a problem. I cracked everything fine. I start the game, change visual setting, play thru a bit. BUT when I start the game again, it crashes in the intro screen. I hate it. Im guessing my settings have been saved somewhere by the game and it cant access it anymore? I have the game run on admin by default. 

Any help would be great. Thanks"
