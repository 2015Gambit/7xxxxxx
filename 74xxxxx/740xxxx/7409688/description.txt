Fixes:

Added ConVars sv_rcon_maxpacketsize and sv_rcon_maxpacketbans to allow server admins to control the maximum RCON packet size and whether or not users get banned for exceeding that limit. The defaults reflect the existing behavior.
Fixed not being able to import custom spray images on Macs
Fixed Macs cancelling http map downloads that take longer than 30 seconds
Updated the HTML renderer for displaying server MOTD
