Morenatsu (μ╝Åπéîπü¬πüñπÇé "Summer break.") is an adult-oriented Kemono Bara Genre/Boys' Love Genre Visual Novel by the Morenatsu Project. It was led by the Kemono artist ╬│, but after his contributions he has since left the project. Morenatsu was originally only available in Japanese, but was translated by the community under the banner of 'MTL Project' (Morenatsu TransLation Project). 

The game takes place during summer vacation in Japan. The main character, Hiroyuki Nishimura (one of the few humans in the game), gets a letter from a friend in the village where he spent his childhood, Suigou village (μ░┤θâ╖μ¥æ Suigou-mura). He moved away to the city five years ago. His grandparents currently live there, so he decides to return there.

Please note that this game is ADULT'S ONLY. It is a GAY VISUAL NOVEL containing explicit sex scenes.
