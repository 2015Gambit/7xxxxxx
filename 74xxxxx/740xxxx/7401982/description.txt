In POP! The Balloon Dog Puzzle Game, you use the arrow keys, or G, J and Y, to guide the puppy across the universe by having him jump on the safe balloons (green ones with nothing on them).

The yellow balloons are OK, but don't linger on them because they tend to sink. The green balloons with the pointed things sticking up are to be avoided - they puncture the puppy and send him down. The red balloons with arrows explode in the direction they point when the puppy lands on them and may or may not aid him in the direction he is headed.
