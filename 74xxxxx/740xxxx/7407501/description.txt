Paradise Lost

A long vacation is just what the doctor ordered for Bethenny and Jason, but the ups and downs that come with it are not. On the second leg of their trip, Jason decides that he has waited long enough to break some news about their new apartment and where they may have to live before they can move in. Willing to put themselves out there again, literally, Jason and Bethenny find themselves on yet another boat ride from hell. Bethenny and Jason can't seem to escape from their own personal issues and a lengthy discussion about work, life, and love forces Jason to face his deepest fears.
