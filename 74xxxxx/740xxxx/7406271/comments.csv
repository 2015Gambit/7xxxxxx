,naff99,2012-07-06T05:20Z,"Just so you all know, this is in hindi......"
,fume0101,2012-07-06T12:11Z,"Seriously...Another Hindi release of the precise same quality? Why exactly do we need so many separate variants? It's odd that there aren't any English versions up yet, considering the movie was released in the U.S. 3 days ago, and it generally takes someone less than two hours to upload one."

,Nemesis85,2012-07-08T10:07Z,Downloaded this for the hell of it and it is terrible. The person that filmed this had it on zoom the whole time. I only watched a few bits but its terrible. Lets hope someone uploads a better quality because this one wouldn't even be worth putting english audio on it. Thanks for the upload though.
