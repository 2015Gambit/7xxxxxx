
Use the Wolfenstien ET-=AviaRa=-.exe to install Enemy Territory and to extract the AntiCheat tool TZAC. If done so check the text below!


In case you are playing Enemy Territory for the first time take a look at the useful_links.tx

Open the TZAC folder to install the newest "Anti-Cheating" tool - which is required for competition play and 
used in most of the current online leagues such as ESL, Clanbase, Crossfire.



If you got problems running this version with Windows 7 or Vista try to start the ET.exe with admin rights.


If it still does not work try this:

-> Run ET.exe and ETDED.exe with administrator rights.
-> Go to your Windows hard drive, Windows, System32 (or SysWOW64 if you run on 64-bits version) and look for :

		PnkBstrA
 		PnkBstrB

-> run both with administrator righs and check the windows XP SP2 compatibility.
