Trivia :---

Film historian Paul E. Gierucki discovered a 16mm print of this previously "lost" film in 2010. In a surprise, it contained Charles Chaplin in a bit part as a Keystone Kop.

Synopsis :---

This Keystone comedy features Charlie Chaplin making an extended and very funny cameo as a policeman. Chaplin had claimed in interviews that he'd played a bit-role as a policeman while at Keystone Studios. The film was believed lost and Chaplin's appearance unknown until a print was discovered in 2010 at a Michigan antique sale.
