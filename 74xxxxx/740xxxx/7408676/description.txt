The life cycle of a plant can be truly remarkable to observe, and the energy of plant life can be truly mystifying; consider how certain environments are inhospitable to life, yet they're sprinkled with various forms of vegetation. Plant reproduction can occur asexually or sexually; the method of reproduction sets the stage for the plant's growth and maturity. This flourishing volume examines the processes of plant reproduction and the stages of plant life, while also spotlighting the role of plants in various ecological settings.
