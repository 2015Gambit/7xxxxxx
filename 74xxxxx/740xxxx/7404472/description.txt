The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the live Sunday, July 1st edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the huge backlash that's forming from governors in response to the Supreme Court's legitimization of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act socialist healthcare law and its flagrantly obvious betrayal of the US constitution. He'll talk about what this signifies in the grander scope of things and asks if this sets a precedent for government being able to force a tax to pay to private interests. He'll discuss the progressively deteriorating global economy and review evidence that indicates the world is in the grasp of criminal banks.
