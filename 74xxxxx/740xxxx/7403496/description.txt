erotic,romance,comedy

A mix-up of identities occurs as an engineer is mistaken for the author of an erotic memoir book. The book concerns the noble inhabitants of a certain manor-house. The trouble is that the current lord of that estate is a very puritanical and intolerant person. What he doesn't know is that his unmarried aunts wrote the scandalous tome.
