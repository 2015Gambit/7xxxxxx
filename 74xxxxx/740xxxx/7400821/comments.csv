Its already been explained to other people that i've seen on here, but I guess u missed it, so here it is again.  On Pirate Bay everyone shares everything several times, and when a new version comes out, same thing happens.  Take a look,  all the different uploaders are putting up the same thing.  Thats how pirate bay has always been.  I've noticed allot of new people lately cursing and calling the uploaders names.  Those of us who have been using the bay for a while appreciate all the green skulls. They can only post what they are given.  9 out of 10 of them don't record the movie.  They get it from a source and try to clean it up, then post it for what seems to be, mostly, ungrateful downloaders! I'm not talking about those of you who have been here, and know the deal.   If you don't like it, don't download it.  Go buy a movie ticket!  Bottom line, you shouldn't talk about what you don't know, and don't come back at me saying you do! You don't! And you shouldn't call people names! Stop it fag!"
,ulickmylips,2012-07-07T04:17Z,"Here! here! budcar, well stated! Thank you for telling it like it is because I totally agree that those that complain about the downloads yet never upload themselves should keep their nasty opinions to themselves. In fact, they should instead put their hand in their pocket and actually buy a ticket!"

This has gone on since the beginning of the public internet....

I made the most popular map for Age of Empires II game, ""Land Nomad""  throughout the years everyone and their mother have put out their own ""version"" of Land Nomad.  I opened the scripts for several of them to see my exact script  with someone else's ""file name"".  I didn't go around yelling at everyone for re-posting my script as their own....   Most would change little things here and there and re-post the script.  I did get invited to Alpha test ""Age of Mythology,"" the next game released by Ensemble Studios because I made ""the map."" 

By the way, Land Nomad is STILL the most popular map used for the game, even after all these years :)"
