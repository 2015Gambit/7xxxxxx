,cormaczoso,2012-07-23T22:53Z,"thanks for these dvds ... this was the first tour i ever saw bruce on and my then favorite album of his ... probably still my fave ... lied to my parents that friends were going with me and we were staying with a friend's cousin to get their car to drive to cleveland to see bruce at the awesome, amazin, best show ever at the agora, parts of which are captured here ... i went by myself and some nice bruce fans invited me to their house, their parents still up and waiting and a bit wide eyed seeing me and hearing the story lol ... but they were so nice, the mom packed me a lunch for the drive home the next day and the dad slipped me a ten for gas and 'in case' ... 8 hour drive ... never forget it or forget that show ... my friends who didn't want to go because darkness 'didn't sound like born to run' were all like 'well i'd have gone if i'd known, if you'd been more persistent' ... fucker lamers ... if i'd been more persistent ... it's my fault right? lol ... we weren't friends long after that little comment made in a big way ...

thanks for the dvds again ... this is one of the most intense tours and that cleveland show was so intense, start to finish, so all out and no holds barred and fast ... if one didn't know better you'd think they were coking but even then bruce didn't allow drugs or hard booze backstage ... just beer but everyone came to play ...
