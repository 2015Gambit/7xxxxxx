  Conjuring the glimmering sunshine, crisp breeze, and carefree vibes of the West Coast, it comes as no surprise that Chicago-based indie pop purveyors Gold Motel began working on their second album by traveling to California. From the hills of Laurel Canyon to a pool house in Glendale, these early sessions set the foundation for what became their self-titled sophomore record. Where debut record Summer House was more of a vehicle to showcase singer/keyboardist Greta Morgan, with Gold Motel a full band with all its unique personalities is on display (hence the decision to make the album self-titled), revealing expanded musicality and matured songwriting.
