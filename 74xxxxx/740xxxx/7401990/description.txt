Storyline
**********

Mitch, Ray, Abbie, and Claire make their escape, rendezvous with Tammy and call Coleman. Mitch wants to meet with Andrew. Jump back two days. Mitch is defending one of his first clients, now accused of attempted murder but claiming he wasn't even there. The prosecution has DNA evidence, so Mitch advises against a "not-there" defense, then finds he's boxed himself into a corner. Is there any way he can help his client? Abbie revisits Moxon's widow; Tammy makes more calls to people on Moxon's list and finds more surprises. Thinking he's figured it out, Mitch goes to Sarah Holt to confront her. Will she finally help, or is she too burned out from war to defend herself?
