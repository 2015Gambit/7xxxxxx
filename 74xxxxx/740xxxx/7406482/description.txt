i found all these episodes here on The Pirate Bay, as they were all in MP4 format i had to convert them to XVID to be able to watch them on my dvd player, so i am uploading them for anyone who may prefer an xvid format they came with a couple of subs files so i have looked the rest up and included them for anyone who might need them i have only watched the 1st episode so far but have found it was a very good story and well worth the download the aspect ratio is 624x352
