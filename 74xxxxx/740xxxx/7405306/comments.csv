,banzai014,2012-07-02T22:26Z,"Why not 720p? I remember downloading The.Brest.Fortress.2010.BluRay.720p.H264 from you. I had never seen a hi-res video before and I was absolutely blown away by the quality, yet dvdrip file size. You could see the pores of skin, the individual dirt marks on the soldiers and the grain of wood, which I never saw in dvdrips."
