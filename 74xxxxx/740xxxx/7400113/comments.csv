,00rimme,2012-06-30T10:33Z,I'm unable to splice the 2 avi segments together maybe someone can put them together and re upload. Anyone know a simple app that's cheap or free that can do this?
,kelleytoons,2012-07-01T12:51Z,Use MKVMerge and both create an MKV file (much better than AVI) as well as merge them together.
,00rimme,2012-07-01T16:14Z,Thanks I'll try that. Tried video joiner no good wont create an output folder. tried several others with similar results.
,00rimme,2012-07-08T06:02Z,"No demand for this any more. If you want this send me a message I'll start it again. I backup all files I upload. Unless something goes horribly wrong.
Also tried several video joiners and have yet to find one that works. I don't have a way to convert to .mkv so I'm stuck with converting to AVI's. If you have one that works that is cheap or free message me at the 00rimme link near the top."
