A Greek-only premium CD, released with the music magazine 'Jazz & Tzaz' (Issue 95)



These are fifteen of the tracks recorded by Charlie Parker in the decade of'40 for independent companies Savoy and Dial, having next to him the young trumpeter Miles Davis.
The sound and music quality of these recordings are already in the field of classical and is one of the most important pages in the history of jazz. 
Essentially, this is the birth of the genre bebop and is the basis on which developed modern jazz until today.
