With former hosts Paul Simon, Michael Palin, and Ralph Nader.
Plus the return of James Taylor, U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan, 
and ex-regular John Belushi.

Fortunately this wasn't done as a "clips" show, because during 
that 1979-1980 season NBC was also running
"The Best of Saturday Night Live" as a 1 hour show on Fridays in prime time.

John Belushi's last appearance on SNL was early in the 7th Season in 
October 1981 in the cold opening, where after Eddie Murphy convinces 
guest host Donald Pleasence to vomit in the sink...they leave the 
men's room complaining about the smell..... 
and then Belushi comes out of the stall, but doesn't say a word!
