The complete works of Darren Shan. (O'Shaughnessy)
            The Saga of Darren Shan.(Cirque Du Freak)

You can tell from Darren Shan's writing style that he struggles a bit but he has managed (against my expectations at least) to churn out one timeless epic after another  so kudos to him.
     Enjoy.
P.S. Please seed; it costs virtually nothing.
P.S.S. Does anyone know where I can download a bluray digital copy of the Darren Shan movie? (Cirque du Freak;The Vampire's Assistant)
