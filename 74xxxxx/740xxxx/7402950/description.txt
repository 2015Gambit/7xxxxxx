Grimm Fairy Tales Presents: Call of Wonderland #2 (of 3)


Julie's continued research in Lovecrafts personal journal leads her to discover the location of the site of the original experiment that unleashed the first portal to Wonderland. But that knowledge may prove to be deadly as the Red Knight strikes out from beyond at any who stand to oppose him. Elsewhere a tattoo artist named Salome has no idea that the tattoo she is about to complete will let loose a horror that might destroy them all.
