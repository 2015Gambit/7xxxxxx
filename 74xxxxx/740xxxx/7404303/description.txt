Deas Vail is an indie rock band, whose lyrics are influenced by their Christian faith, signed to Mono Vs Stereo label. The name "Deas Vail" is a combination of Latin and old French, roughly translated as "Humble servant of God." The band's third full-length album, "Deas Vail", has earned them respect as well as slots at Bonnaroo and a headlining performance at CMJ.
