,dezMoZone,2012-07-02T06:08Z,"Seriously, this poster puts up constant quality, usually before anyone else and in a sea of crap. Anyone calling fake needs to sit down and think things through. If you don't like the size, wait for something else. "

,eightyth_attempt2register,2012-07-03T03:49Z,"@ratliff33

Eztv doesn't have a high resolution one yet.


@theshape31

1080i, not 1080p


Also this is a good quality version because it's not 58 rar files like the other one."
,Sperious,2012-07-06T23:53Z,"I'm watching on my LG BD390 Network Player. All previous seasons of True Blood have looked fantastic, however these new season 5 IMMERSE episodes stutter when I watch them. It's particularly visible during camera panning. I have not changed anything in my setup. Anyone else with this problem?"
