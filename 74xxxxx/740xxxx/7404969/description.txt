Jesca Hoop returns with her third album The House That Jack Built on her own label on June 25th 2012.

The House That Jack Built deftly showcases its authorΓÇÖs unflinching tendency to pull focus from widescreen to close-up. Part siren song, part grim warning, it achieves a perspective-warping balance between the haunting intimacy of HoopΓÇÖs delivery and an unconfined air of horizon-scanning grandeur from the outset ΓÇô tempestuous, moodily melodic opener ΓÇÿBorn ToΓÇÖ shares this striking duality with later highlights ΓÇÿWhen IΓÇÖm AsleepΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿPeacemakerΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿDeeper DevastationΓÇÖ.

It arrives with more than a few splashes on its hands. Life and death; light and dark; sex and war; head and heart: The House That Jack Built offers up as much in celebration of the macabre as it does in mistrust of the familiar, with a twist of humour. ItΓÇÖs steeped in an allusion to biology, nature and humanity, but drops precious few clues as to whether its next rush of imagery is set to beguile or repel.
