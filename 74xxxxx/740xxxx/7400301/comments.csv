Can anyone confirm they installed and used this successfully? Also, does anyone know if it is possible to install the Real Tracks (by themselves) into a Mac version of Band-in-a-box? (I already use the program on a mac, but mainly wanted to try the Real Tracks from this torrent). many thanks"
,CatMan100,2012-09-01T19:10Z,"Dear riley79

I think this files are only for pc and not for mac
but in PG page maybe you can investigate it!!
good luck !

,riley79,2012-09-03T05:27Z,Thanks CatMan. Just wondering - did you get this to work on a PC? I also have that option. But 79 GB is a lot! I was hoping someone on this thread could confirm it worked ok.

this compilation is 'pure Gold'Actually I've only 40 gb and it works ok! and now that I find /79gb in the piratebay that sounds great I've some earlier versions of BIABs like Version 10.0/11.0/2004 and there are a great advantages !
good luck riley79 !! "
