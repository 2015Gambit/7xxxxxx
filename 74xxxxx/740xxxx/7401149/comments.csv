USE THE MAGNET LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION

Why? Cause when I found the original torrent it was only a magnet link, and I don't know how to make a .torrent from the magnet link. "
,crimzind,2012-07-03T17:40Z,"Don't suppose someone could verify that this is actually legit?

I mean, only upload by someone name SourceFM, and it's not even really an upload, it's a comment telling people to click a Magnet link, which you can't see the contents of before it's actually started downloading stuff, etc. It's fishy. "
,damoggen,2012-07-03T18:14Z,Torrent doesn't even start
,Weses,2012-07-03T19:35Z,"It's legit. You just gotta start sfm.exe with -nosteam or -nonsteam after it, with ""run"" or whatever. The only problem I have is that it doesn't seem to render anything above 360p... even if I select higher. It just upscales the 360p image... how to fix?"
,Nabakin,2012-07-05T20:52Z,The torrent is downloading and at lightning speeds!  I'll report if it works or not.
