QED 38 - Wave~Particle mechanics

The equilateral geometry of Wave~Particle mechanics as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Tetryonic geometry provides a complete explanation of the wave-particle geometry of Electromagnetic waves.

The relationships between Transverse quanta and Longitudinal photons that constitute EM waves along with Wavefunctions as a probabilistic description of the quantised geometry of EM waves is revealed

The thirty-eighth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
