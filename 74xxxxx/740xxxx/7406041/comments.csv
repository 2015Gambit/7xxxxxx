P.S: don't try to play game through the Activation DLC.exe (because it is impossible)"
,Soboller,2012-07-02T21:42Z,"Thanks Lingvort, it works :)"
,kentcave,2012-07-03T03:04Z,CoA all corrected? Woot!
,Ixor779,2012-07-03T04:57Z,"Works perfectly, thanks."
,Aodr,2012-07-03T16:21Z,"Works perfectly. Thanks for the great upload. Even fixed the terrain issue, which had been showing up incorrectly in other torrents and my legit copy.

Bought a legit copy only to be forced to resort to a pirated version anyway. Last time I buy from paradox, 10 dollars for any DLC is way too much."
,Sathyro,2012-07-04T22:47Z,it works HORRIBLE in spanish
,sergio_sos,2012-07-05T01:31Z,"@Sathyro, I used to play in spanish but after some patch (can't remember) the traduction was terrible. I don't believe it's a problem of this repack.

@Lingvort, thank you for this upload! All DLCs are working ;)
Sadly when I patched this version to 1.06b the CoA for the minor dinasties is still messed up. Anyway it's no biggie, game works fine."
,Ixor779,2012-07-05T02:11Z,"@sergio Generaly the COA of minor dynasties change after every patch. I also was able to patch the hotfix without dlc issue, though the map textures are once again messed up."
,kentcave,2012-07-05T03:20Z,"Salute Lingvort. This up works perfectly!

Wait..1.06b out? Hmm..gonna check whats the improvement first before messing up anything else..again.

Lingvort..we gonna wait for you to up a perfect version again. Thanks."
,Lingvort,2012-07-05T12:22Z,"@kentcave
i'll look if there is a new SxSxL repack and (if there is) i will upload it.

P.S: not only the CoA for minor dynasties are messed up, the game creates new summary each time you end and start game

P.S: 1.06b? crap, need to download it."
,kentcave,2012-07-06T09:05Z,"I stopped wishing for 1.06b..at least till I finished up my current run of my game (200+ years into Empire of Brittania)..since the save games WONT be compatible with 1.06.

Plenty of new holdings added all over the map. Was happy and eager to try it..BUT wont appears in continued games..only new games. So..beware.

1.06b have plenty of nice addittions..but those can wait. In a month or two..patience rewards us a fuller experience of the game. Many screamed for SoI..but I think they still have their current Christian rulers game running. Such a shame/waste to abandon those.

I notice a huge memory-leak in patch 1.06, making the game almost unplayable once you own 1/4 of the world. Such was the state of my current game. Just scrolling through the map became dragging pain. 
Only Arabia/Mesopotamia/Cumania are left for me to conquer..the rest are all under the heel of British Empire. lol"
,4331a,2012-07-14T01:47Z,Any idea where to get 1.06b? Lotsa small fixes.
,kentcave,2012-07-14T03:31Z,"with SxSxl version, you can just choose to manually update and dl the patch..and just patch it once dl finish..
but be warned..the COA will be mess up, lots will have black COA and the new holdings wont show up in saved games anyway..
even the mali/songhay wont appear..although map will show their countries but be blank out"
,kentcave,2012-07-14T05:32Z,"Empire of Britannia and Francia both :

,kentcave,2012-07-18T09:37Z,"Ignore his comment..this torrent WORKS perfectly. Just follow instructions or make sure your specs are okay..mmmkay @,-p.."
,drskn28,2012-07-18T18:21Z,Hey Thanks a lot Lingvort. Game installed perfect and working smoothly so far. Keep it up ;)
,NephilimNexus,2012-07-23T15:01Z,"I bought this game off Steam when it first came out and loved it, but sadly the latest 1.06b patch actually gave me more problems than it fixed, so I'm just going to run this version (hopefully 1.06 original) in a new directory until that gets resolved.

Great game, by the way."
,kentcave,2012-07-24T03:53Z,"aint compatible with many mods too..agot?

but if you wanna play as moslem, its essential.

new game started has many MORE holdings too

1.06 has many essential improvements..the strong/weak claims, 7 new empires and plenty more kingdoms, the new martial traits, etc

1.06b only has moslem bug-fixing and new holdings as incentive..but improment is improvement @,-p.."
,hotriceguy,2012-07-24T22:49Z,Excuse me where is the DLC shop pop-up? Is it the one inside the game?
,kimmj,2012-07-26T01:01Z,"Hello, thanks for uploading Lingvort. I am bit confused how i can use the dlc. You said launch Activation DLC. exe but I can't find this in my game directory. Maybe it might be due to the fact i have installed crusader kings 2 from this site   http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7201402/Crusader_Kings_II___1.05b__amp_amp__Ruler_Designer_DLC

can you recommend where i should get torrent for crusader kings 2? Also, since i didn't find this exe. I launched the game and dlc didn't work. (Not to mention dlc i got in the site i mentioned maybe that might be the cause. However, i tried to get crusader kings in different site but they or offered same types of installation) Thank you for reading"
,kentcave,2012-07-26T03:02Z,sigh..
,Lingvort,2012-07-26T21:52Z,"@kimmj
the version you downloaded does not have these exe.file and DLCs included. You need to download this one. It will have DLCs and Activation DLC."
,Lingvort,2012-07-26T21:52Z,"*this (not ""these"", sorry)"
,tetrapax,2012-07-27T08:17Z,Does the kill plot work because i dont have the option of killing someone even if the plot power is above 100%?
,noekk,2012-07-28T04:22Z,"Hi, I have the Skidrow version updated to 1.06b already, can I download this and install just the Islam DLC ? Thanks."
,Froststahr,2012-07-29T20:41Z,"I click the setup thing and nothing happens, i mounted with virtual clone drive. and my specs are fine to play CK2. is there anything i need installed?"
,Turcca,2012-07-30T07:53Z,"If you get black screen and your computer freezes on lauch, check your firewall. It solved the issue for me."
,noekk,2012-07-31T01:07Z,"Does this have *all* nine DLCs ? If not, where can I get them ? I want the complete package. Thanks."
,noekk,2012-07-31T01:51Z,"How do I disable some DLCs ? If I uncheck them in the launcher they become checked the next time I start.

If I delete them from the DLC folder I get the store popup on the title screen and don't even know if the other DLCs are active.

This release may work but it's shitty. That 'repacked by sxsx' on the title screen is also very annoying. And it says v1.05 not 1.06."
,thisisme4,2012-08-05T01:28Z,only about 400 MiB? Interesting... We'll see if this works
,bpiq1,2012-08-07T17:04Z,"HI, i heard there's the latest 1.06b patch out, can anyone tell me if it's a huge improvement or not so much that i can live with 1.06 anyway ? if it's the former, can i just download this, then download the 1.06b patch and install that ?

and how about the other DLC's, what's the story about them ? thanks "
,bpiq1,2012-08-07T17:06Z,oh and also how about mods will they work with this ? i heard there's a new game of thrones mod that i'd like to try
,bpiq1,2012-08-08T05:06Z,"hello i do not understand how to activate the DLCs...

so i launched the Activation DLC.exe and when i'm in the in-game menu nothing happens... i mean should i wait for a pop-up ? but i've been waiting like 5 mins and nothing... how do these pop-ups look like anyway ? is it the red bar with the text inside it that says new DLC content available ? 

anyway like i said i'm not able to activate it since there are no pop-ups "
,bpiq1,2012-08-08T05:09Z,"ok forget my last comment got it to work, you're supposed to start the game several times not wait for it to happen 

but my first two questions still stand though (re mods and 1.06b patch)"
,Dag0Red,2012-08-14T03:36Z,"There's a problem. I've installed the whole game just fine, but I've noticed many of the noble family coats of arms are not properly in place.

What I mean by that is that the wrong families have custom coats of arms that belong elsewhere, while the prominent families that were supposed to have the custom coat of arms have a generic one that changes every time you start the game.

Some custom family coats of arms are fine, but others aren't. We've lost the custom coat of arms of the Salian German imperial family, of the Aleramicci family (the famous crusading counts of Montferrat), and others as well.

There used to be a fix for similar problems. I remember someone talking about editing the coats of arms.TXT file from the ""interface"" folder, but I have no idea how exactly. Does anyone know how to fix this?"
,Dag0Red,2012-08-15T01:53Z,"We had a similar problem before with the coats of arms. It used to be fixable by way of editing the coats_of_arms.TXT file in the ""interface"" folder of the game directory.

If one edited that file, scrolled down to the reference to the dynasties.tga file with the coordinates 
x = 16 y = 4 
and changed them to
x = 51 y = 1 
the problem would go away. 

I tried fiddling with that, and I fixed some of the dynasty coats of arms, but others were messed up.

Clearly, there's need for a new set of coordinates that will restore the messed-up dynasty coats to their owners. That's my take anyway, a fix is necessary either way fellas. I myself have no idea what the coordinates even mean."
,Vigilanceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,2012-08-22T12:19Z,"Hey Ive been trying to get the ""Game of Thrones"" mod to work with this, is there any way to get it to work with the dlc as well?
When I use the launcher all the dlcs deactivate themselves."
,zatoeechii,2012-08-31T04:29Z,whatta an annoying release
,vicknen,2012-09-03T18:54Z,anybody got the ck2plus mod to work with this?
,vicknen,2012-09-03T18:54Z,and thank you so much for the upload. saved a lot of time. :)
,PowerOfThePoor1992,2012-09-07T10:01Z,"wow lingvort you must bee the stupiediest uploader of all time how da heck is people supposed to install the game clean and good when there isn't a clear and nice instructions for us to follow.

there is no point in fucking downloading this shit because it will fuck upp you whole game.

your download is a file, when i mount it doesn't work, so i said well then i must rar, when i did that i got the 1.06 patch which is in some kind of fucked up languauge you no understand maybe thats where you come from lingvort.

and then when you try it for a bit you will find a way to get around and install it when you have done that.

you say something about activating dlc from somwhere n the game dir which is bullshit i searched it all over and the only way you can find is when you search when you do that the exe comes up but the exe is shiiit and doesn't give what you call shop pop-up whata fuck is that anyway you twaaaat 


anyway so i'm guessing that where i start game from well i click it and boom the holegame is messed nothing works.

First of don't upload a torrent you don't understand or even know how it work or if you don't know how to fucking explain and put some time in to it"
