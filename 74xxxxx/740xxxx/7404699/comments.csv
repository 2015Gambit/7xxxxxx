,soonerchad,2012-07-02T06:31Z,"Dont waste your time with this one, it has a password and you have to go to a website and do a stupid survey!  NO JOKE!"
,ElSofoque,2012-07-02T06:35Z,What fucking password are you talking about JayUchicha? This is not fake rar crap!
,ElSofoque,2012-07-02T06:37Z,Omg don't be greedy guys download speed is abysmal...SEED!
,smokinq,2012-07-02T06:38Z,SEED DAMN IT!
,craiglive,2012-07-02T06:42Z,"When one considers that this is an ettv upload who, by the way, is a VIP member, it becomes hard to imagine that this torrent has a ""fucking RAR password"". As many ettv torrents as I've downloaded, I don't know that I've ever gotten one in any other file format than a video file format."
,BreakingBadFan,2012-07-02T06:43Z,"if you are asking if this torrent is real then your obviously a troll. ettv is always a real upload and NO there are not any fucking rar passwords. Asshole trolls, go fuck a horse"
,BreakingBadFan,2012-07-02T06:44Z,"sorry these trolls are pissing me off, i forgot to leave feedback on the quality. Again, this is ettv so you should know the quality is great as usual. A/V 10, thanks ettv!"
,ElSofoque,2012-07-02T06:46Z,Seed or perish!
,drummerpunk7,2012-07-02T06:55Z,45kbps is awesome. or not.
,tiffiny.xo,2012-07-02T07:17Z,"Download is a bit slow, but no doubt it will be worth the wait. Have never had any issues with ettv before :)"
,hales89,2012-07-02T07:18Z,Seed :( PLEASE!!!
,BitMound,2012-07-02T07:22Z,"And here we go with the cascade of moronic dipfucks screaming about their slow dl speed and bitching about seeders.   Let me explain it in retard speak so you dopes understand:  ""a lot of people taking from a few people means it be slow"" "
,skky_d,2012-07-02T07:24Z,"always DL from u, just wanna say thanks! "
,skky_d,2012-07-02T07:25Z,oh and it DL at 680-699 for me...perfection!
,pipi8,2012-07-02T07:30Z,thanks a lot :)
,craiglive,2012-07-02T07:36Z,"As can always be expected from ettv, this is a top notch download! Never mind the trollls too! This isn't a RAR file and there is NO password either. It's a video file in the mp4 video format. Nothing shady here. A=9 V=9"
,xp1794two,2012-07-02T08:25Z,it is a .rar file and THERE IS A PASSWORD
,inasaw,2012-07-02T13:40Z,"After downloading for an hour or so I find out this is a rar file and you have to get a ""password"" from bowad.com. This is junk! Someone remove it please."
,grimnar,2012-07-02T13:43Z,"I know ettv is a VIP uploader, but this is FAKE. I is a passworded .rar file"
,machspee,2012-07-02T15:23Z,"@grimnar 

You are a fucking retard. You think people are stupid enough to believe  what you type with your shitty hands? "
,Shiloh25,2012-07-02T17:43Z,"While I'm new to this site, so far I have always dl'd my True Blood episodes from this user. Excellent quality!!!"
,anyutak,2012-07-02T18:11Z,Just downloaded this.  ettv is always a great download but there's a problem here.  Definitely a scam.  RAR file and then sends you to a web site for a password.  Asks you for your mobile number to win something.  Waste of time.
,grimnar,2012-07-03T02:51Z,"@machspee

Hey shitdick, don't you think if there really wasn't an issue people wouldn't be commenting about this torrent being a .rar file and password protected? 

True Blood S05E04 HDTV XviD-AFG[ettv]  Works perfectly without any issue"
,berserkers,2012-07-03T13:58Z," No fucking rar and password . Eztv fanatics , guys posting on wrong torrent or simply born moron  are the one saying this shit

Mp4 , fast download , 10/10
thx for up"
,forgoremembering,2012-07-10T04:51Z,"People are not being trolls....the download that has .rar and password crap   is ""True Blood S05E04 We ll Meet Again HDTV x264 -ASAP [ettv]""  ...vs this one which is ""True Blood S0504 HDTV x264 -ASAP [ettv]"".  the other file seems to have been removed, so not sure who it was exactly since I had only looked at title when downloading it, but they used ettv in their title and copied most of the title format.  "
