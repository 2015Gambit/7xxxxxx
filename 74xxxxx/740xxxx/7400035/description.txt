Ek Adesh(Command For Choti)|2006|CFSI|DVDRip|E-Subs|Phantom

Choti belongs to a farming community in a semi-desert region of Rajasthan where her people are known for conserving the environment, especially the deer. One day she notices a man from a community of hunters who depend on hunting deer as their source of livelihood, trying to shoot a deer. Chhoti rescues the deer only to cause a flashpoint between the two divergent communities. This short film sensitively portrays the moral dilemma caused by a clash between different ways of life and the need for protecting the environment.
