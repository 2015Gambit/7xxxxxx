Notes: A zombie film, from the creator of 30 Days Of Night. Based on the comic
of the same name. Retail date is August 7th. For whatever reason, Shout! Factory
released this film on BlU Ray and DVD with a 2 channel audio track, instead of
5.1. I left the bitrate at 384, as this is encoded from a DTS-MA track, but it is
still 2.0. 720p to follow

AXED! We do this better
