Bett the maker of it, is now part of the 1% with all the income hes due to have made. And i might add, made, becouse people are so desperate to belive in something else.
What truly is the difference between beliving in santa claus, zeitgeist or an allmighty god. 
None of it is based on facts:/"
,lapis2,2012-07-02T22:08Z,Im pretty sure High Quality Zeitgeist is an oxymoron.  Seriously this shit is such vapid nonsense.
,Phoenix70,2012-07-02T23:19Z,"If the two of you above have any better ideas relating to the topics and info covered in the films and movement, I'm sure we'd all like to here it... :)
The truth is usually hated by the masses, originally...
Stick around. When the dust settles, reality is getting clearer every day.
Peace and love to all, we'll get our acts together eventually. E:)"

It's like holding the door for the person behind you.
A little love goes a long way, especially when it's rare.
Peace, out... E:)"
,bluesborn,2012-07-12T07:02Z,I just was wondering about video audio quality and really could have done without the politics.It's nauseating. I'm with you Phoenix-the world needs more LOVE.
,Phoenix70,2012-07-29T22:07Z,"As far as info about the quality...
These are the original Dvd Iso files downloaded from Zeitgeist The Movie, which were then converted to avi.
All three Dvds were originally 720x480.
However, the first film was Full Screen (4:3), and the other two were Wide Screen (16:9).
So, the resolutions were expanded to keep all the original detail... E:)
As always, Love and Peace, brothers and sisters... xo"
,MatadorZA,2012-08-08T20:37Z,"this shits legit. even if you disagree with their views on pretty much anything, it doesnt hurt to be educated a little, there are lots of valid points or facts in these films"
,MatadorZA,2012-08-13T21:26Z,"To the idiot that said this film made the producers and everyone involved rich, you're retarded. these films were released for free on the internet "

,effector1980,2012-09-16T13:26Z,"Sun goes up, yay god rocks!!!
Sun goes down ahhhhh underworld, pray!!!
Sun goes up got forgave us all!!!!

C'mon people, 1,500 similarities between religions created by man, smart men trying to manipulate, that is all, you die, you rot (or burn if your cremated)"
,Phoenix70,2012-09-20T20:01Z,"Thanx to everyone who commented...
That's really the point of all this (Zietgeist, Pirate Bay, David Icke), to start a real conversation...
Don't just zone out on your iPod, talk to the person next to you about something real...
And finally, don't just quote what you've heard unless you have really understood and agree...
p.s. Check out Julian Assange - The World Tomorrow, peace and love xo E:)"
