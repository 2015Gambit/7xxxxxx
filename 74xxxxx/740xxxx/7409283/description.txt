Mary Mary is an American gospel music duo, consisting of sisters Erica Atkins-Campbell and Trecina "Tina" Atkins-Campbell. The duo are often credited along with Kirk Franklin for broadening the fan base of urban contemporary gospel in the 2000s by introducing elements of soul music, hip hop, funk and jazz. Mary Mary broke onto the music scene with their popular song "Shackles (Praise You)" which is considered one of the pioneering songs of urban contemporary gospel music.
