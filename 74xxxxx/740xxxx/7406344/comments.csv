,loveheart,2012-07-03T03:50Z,can someone upload the movie in english please!all available cam's are in fucking hindi!
,Creyme,2012-07-03T07:01Z,"Be patient, everyone. No need to be mad about the wait considering the movie didn't even premiere in America until just an hour ago or so. We'll get an english version soon. It shouldn't be annoying that the only videos we've gotten so far are in hindi and russian. What is annoying though is that neither of them LABELED the language (and the hindi one labeled incorrectly as English)"
,Vaders--,2012-07-04T01:35Z,"potu1468 and sohelparvez ???

We are pirates, we steal our gold, we don't look at it through windows... get lost already"
,BOOGY350,2012-07-04T05:52Z,finally its out! I saw it 3 years ago in  my time machine also you can download it at eatadickspammers.com
,sycozax,2012-07-04T23:03Z,nicely put creyme for those bitchin about a different language why dont u go record the audio see how you do we want 10/10 so get to it....or just be quiet
,Creyme,2012-07-05T07:51Z,"@sycozax:  Yeah, it's pretty sad really. Like us pirates are getting this shit for free anyway... they can't... wait? Plus I don't know exactly where in Europe and when it was released. It's possible that it wasn't even released in English at all before the 3rd (except maybe at special early screenings of it).  The english version will be up soon now that it's been released in America and if people are really dead set on watching it now... well just go to the movies. "
,Aly1369,2012-07-05T13:01Z,"Calm down, ppl, give it a few days, a cam will come out thats English, and a better quality as well, its NOT as tho your paying to watch it......"
,zvengar,2012-07-06T05:33Z,"SCENEBALANCE .... WHAT A JOKE!

THEY ARE A BUNCH OF LAZY, RIP-OFF, UP-LOADERS.

90% OF THIER UPLOADS ARE FROM COPYING FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S UPLOAD THAN POSTING AS THERE OWN.

HENCE THE REASON FOR JUST LINKS IN THE INFO BOX.

BUT HEY,TRHATS BEEN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE "
,4nt1trt,2012-07-06T18:11Z,"if its released in july 3rd, why havent any english torrent?"
,SchichtimSchacht,2012-07-06T22:28Z,no its 1080p full HD tripple audio u can watch it on 150 inch screen
,tweaker61,2012-07-07T02:15Z,It IS July 3rd. The Reason there are no english torrents YET is because no one has actually bothered to put one up. 
,goya_online,2012-07-07T08:57Z,What kills me is the fools that have the nerve to be sooooo nasty about uploads. I understand if its fake & has a virus or says its hd quality when it isn't. But stop being a cheap ass!!! If u wanna see it goto the theater. Otherwise you gotta wait!!! Shout out to the uploaders that find these movies & 2thumbs up for those that edit/enhance these movies. #pirate bay all day
,Nwa-El,2012-07-07T11:08Z,come on i want an english version i'm in saudi arabia and theres no theaters here fuck this country =(
,fume0101,2012-07-07T13:02Z,"@Creyme

Generally, I'd agree with your patience is a virtue policy. However, it's been out for 5 days in the U.S. now, and there isn't a single upload in English. I'm going to go so far as to say that this is a cause for concern, as it usually takes less than 12 hours for the early english cams to start popping up. I read that the Sony Pictures is employing some new form of anti-piracy security checks in the theatres, but the article mentioned that it was only overseas. Not sure what the score is, but something is up. Thoughts?"
,4nt1trt,2012-07-08T10:02Z,"still july 13th has left for release in europe, is it any chance for us or not?
maybe one month later someone upload an english version.
oh god I dont wanna watch on theatre, seriously dont like to pay money.
hope a bro upload it soon."
,ndylostkid,2012-07-08T22:01Z,"@Nwa-El: u're not alone !!! im in KSA too...Lol
still waiting for Bluray, or at least DVDrip..."
,infernal92,2012-07-09T00:12Z,"Ok, now It's getting weird. 6 days after the movie premiere and still no english cam releases?
First time I've seen this... problem? Don't know how else to call it."
,Animeman1000,2012-07-09T01:47Z,"@sirajul12 You spamming fag. You have to pay for that shit. If we get it for free why the fuck would we wanna pay for it and why the fuck do you link it on a Torrent site. Now if you somehow download it and upload it here than good for you, but since you probably won't, then get the fuck out of here with that shit."
,DanBCooper,2012-07-10T06:54Z,"How about you warn somebody that it's not even in English, the most spoken language on the planet."
,Juxhin_666,2012-07-10T20:49Z,It's 2012...and people still can't find a way to record with a decent cam for minimal watchable quality....God damn it. Stupid lazy fags.
,D_Junkie,2012-07-11T03:08Z,"A-1

don't waste time by downloading it"
