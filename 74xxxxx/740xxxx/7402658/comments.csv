I can't download them since it requires skyrim to be installed (i install the game with a borrowed modem, that's why i hate steam) while my gaming pc is at home and the only way to access internet is via hotspot with my lame netbook."
,-xbt-,2012-07-02T18:31Z,I will add those in my next Update! I'm releasing Update 2.1 soon =)
,-xbt-,2012-07-02T18:34Z,"Dragon Age Ogre has already been removed, due to ""not proper permissions"". I don't think it's anywhere else so unless the uploader uploads it somewhere else, we are SOL."
