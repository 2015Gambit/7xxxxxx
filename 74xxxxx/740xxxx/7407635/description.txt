QED 28 - ElectroMagnetic waves

The equilateral geometry of EM waves as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The geometric combining of Photons into group EM waves by way of their photo-magnetons is explained.

Transverse & Longitudinal EM waveforms along with their EM wave functions, polarisation, and the mechanics behind ΓÇÿaction-at-a-distanceΓÇÖ are explained in full for the first time in recorded history.

The twenty-eight chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
