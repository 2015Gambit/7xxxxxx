1st you must download POWER ISO = http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7418729/Power_Iso_5.2__Serials_-_[EC]

after installation extract all zip files from Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition PC

after extracting you will get a ISO file of that game DVD

Mount that discimage file with poweriso by clicking TOOLS->Virtual drive->Mount image to drive.

after this step you can see all files in your DVD Drive.

then simply install game by clicking setup.exe

after installation copy all files from SKIDROW folder to your game installed folder. "
