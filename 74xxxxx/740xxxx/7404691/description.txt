another mixed bag of music. this one contains industrial, punk, dubstep, world music, alternative, synthpop, metal, electronica and more. list of artists: dead can dance, depeche mode, enduser, lagwagon, linkin park, machines of loving grace, mashur, massive attack, mesh, ministry, pendulum, recoil, rednek, shonen knife, spk and tool. some of these rips are mine, some are not. all mp3s, most to all are very high quality. all files have been run through mp3gain so that their volume is set by perceived loudness, not normalization. normalization is absolutely horrible. artwork is attached. the genre tags are probably debatable, but there are a million sub-genres and i'm too lazy to nitpick. they are basically tagged so that they are grouped together with songs that have similar traits and each genre can be played on random without any songs causing wtf moments. all are in directories that you can plop into itunes or your listening thingy of choice.

enjoy, and please seed. i will be posting a lot of torrents in the future, and i'll have to start deleting old ones so that i can put new ones up.
