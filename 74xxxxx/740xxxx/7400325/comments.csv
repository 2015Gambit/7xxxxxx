,tigo123,2012-06-30T18:00Z,HOW DO YOU ADD THE SAVES FROM EPISODE 1 TO THIS ONE?!?!
,Flyer_10,2012-06-30T18:16Z,"One exe wrapped in a rar spells trouble for me.

The rar isnt even compressed so install at your own risk. Especially as theres several hundred extra mb in this release and its his only upload."
,BigG95,2012-06-30T18:37Z,"@tigo123 
In the documents folder go to telltale games then you'll see two folders of the game..the one you previously played and the one you installed now just simply copy everything from the first folder into the new one...worked for me"
,JackMike16,2012-06-30T19:19Z,SEED PLEASE!
,odbyd,2012-06-30T20:03Z,"just finished 2nd episode... 2 months of waiting just to play it for 3 hours and there we have another months to wait for another episode XD 
great game!"
,SenorSkur,2012-06-30T20:15Z,The first chinese torrent didn't have anything on it. 
,mustaine.86,2012-06-30T21:13Z,"@BigG95  thanks for the tip =D, but... SEED D:"
,jakenator,2012-06-30T21:23Z,works perfectly! and thanks BigG95 for telling us how to move the game save. And thanks mptjedude for a great upload! been waiting a while for this one.
,bewilled,2012-07-01T14:15Z,"game worked, at first was a little suspicous about .exe inside the .zip. Took the risk and seemed to be worth it. "
,joekey311,2012-07-02T10:10Z,"Just wanted to chime in that this works 100%, if you happen to already have the first game, simply uninstall it.  You don't even have to backup your old saves for this game, I didn't bother backing up my saves, started this game, and was able to continue the 2nd game with my previous save state.  Very happy with this download ty mptje"
,mo63090,2012-07-02T23:03Z,Works great!
,j_ulysses,2012-07-04T02:43Z,"just started dl today, hope still works."
,revan09,2012-07-04T03:01Z,When i open the game DOESNT OPENNNNNNNNNNNN F**k Dont download folks i think is Virus 
,PPierce34,2012-07-04T03:12Z,Anyone else get the glitch in chapter 7 where no conversation options appear and Brenda just shoots you every time as she's dragging Katjaa up the stairs? I googled it and just found a bunch of forum posts of people begging for it to be patched...
,Utorrentj,2012-07-06T11:31Z,Seed!!!
,kogaboy,2012-07-08T20:00Z,"amm, I downloaded the game, and when I start it, an error pops out saying it didnt fount d3dx9_41.dll"
,java4u,2012-07-16T22:00Z,Working great! thanks
,PPierce34,2012-07-18T14:38Z,"The ""glitch"" I was talking about is actually just poor game design. If you experience what I described, just move forward slowly, when Brenda speaks STOP and do not move forward or backward, aim at her waist and the conversation option will appear, click it"
,MemberTPB,2012-07-29T13:07Z,"Just Downloaded. Seeding with Amaizing speed at the moment, this how the installer looks alike.

That means you cant see what's it is doing, that could mean it haves few fake files that went to TellTale GamesWalkingDead... 
But it might be a Server whitch are easy to FUD"
,Wolfcock,2012-07-29T21:36Z,"It works fine, no viruses, etc... Thanks to the uploader."
,GuyFromPa,2012-07-31T23:32Z,"Downloaded, installed, and working great!"
,mad.man,2012-08-01T03:58Z,"Anyone else having an issue starting episode 2?  I played the first three or four minutes just fine, then I started over and now I can't load episode 2 at all.  It just goes to a black screen with an axe on the left of the screen, I can hear birds, trees rustling and wind blowing, but that's it....  Any clues?"
,UrF4CEizN00B,2012-08-09T09:12Z,"PPierce34 OMG pierce YOU ARE A FUKING NOOB!, thinking that was a GLITCH lmao."
,PPierce34,2012-08-30T00:01Z,"1. Nobody really uses the word noob anymore bro, it's kinda played out.

2. If you were calling me a new inexperienced player, I was, and anyone else who plays a new game for the first time is.

3. Like I said, I googled it at the time and all I found were countless forum posts from all over the net saying it was a glitch that needed to be Patched."
,kayman1979,2012-09-16T01:45Z,"PPierce34, actually A LOT of people still use the word noob especially amongst gamers and I don't see it going away anytime soon"
