Ancient Lives
Unlocking the mysteries of DAILY LIFE in ANCIENT EGYPT 
How did ordinary Egyptians live in the time of the pharaohs? Renowned British Egyptologist John Romer explores the ruins of an ancient village just outside Thebes, where generations of craftsmen and artists built and decorated royal tombs. There, relics reveal the most intimate details of the people's daily lives: their meals, their loves, their quarrels, and even their dreams. 
Go inside the pharaohs' most magnificent tombs and see astonishing art and priceless treasures. Meet the scribes, stonemasons, and high priests who presided over this city of the dead. Learn the secrets of the tomb raiders and the tricks devised to thwart them. This four-part series provides fascinating insights into a civilization now lost to the ages. 
As seen on public television. DVD released Nov 2009.
