Dust Up - Canadian CropDustingReality Series (2011) S01 Complete xvid avi

I converted from a web stream to xvids.. sadly they would only send
400bitrate so some pixelizing happens.. hence why the files are
smaller then 180mb for a normal 30min show

take it or leave it..

follows a team of crop dusters (yep another show with planes!)
it must of been a pilot series (no pun intended LOL) since
only 6 made and no sign of another series 


havent watched it myself.. but might be interesting or funny

BUT HELP SEED if grabbing.. too many are hit and running
and torrents ending up dead or deleted by the torrent sites
if they have no seeders

enjoy
