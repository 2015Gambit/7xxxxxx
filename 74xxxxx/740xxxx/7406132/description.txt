Bugs! A Rainforest Adventure 
Bugs! A Rainforest Adventure is a 2007 Imax 3-D presentation, here reduced to the much more modest scale of DVD. The expensive and exacting show is a peek at the insect life in a Malaysian rain forest, featuring macro photography of exceedingly high quality. 
Explore the extraordinary hidden world of insects, where a leaf weighs more than a car, rain drops feel like exploding hand grenades and a blade of grass soars like a skyscraper. Shot on location in the Borneo rainforest, Bugs! brings the beautiful and dangerous universe of its tiny stars up close and personal with cutting-edge technology that magnifies them up to 250,000 times their normal size. Don't miss this unforgettable, stunning film that reveals the dramatic, savage and awe-inspiring lives of these fascinating creatures. Narrated by Judi Dench
