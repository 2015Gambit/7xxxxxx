QED 26 - Photon properties

The equilateral geometry behind properties of Photons as derived from  Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Reveals the distinct properties of Photons including their role as a quantum Harmonic oscillator.

Faraday rotation, EulerΓÇÖs formula, the inverse square law and Compton scattering are all applied, along with super-positioning of EM waves to create white light.

The twenty-sixth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
