Hidden Track/PC Art Audio from Mechanical Animals by Marilyn Manson
I apologize for the 64kbps quality, but the track is low regardless.

Ripped this audio from the Flash art gallery of 2 pieces of his art work 
that plays when you insert the Mechanical Animals CD into your CD-ROM.

Enhanced with Audacity as best as I could before it became distorted.
