Unfortunately it didnt work for me..I did all as per your instructions, and it seemed that i had registered the product successfully..However when i went to use it i got the message ""Register Code is not correct.We strongly recommend that you copy/paste it""

Any suggestions??

Thanks"

I haven't been able to duplicate the problem, so I've not had a chance to fix it. Very sorry about that mate."
