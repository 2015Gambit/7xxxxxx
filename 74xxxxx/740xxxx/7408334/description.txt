Promising "a new adventure with bears", it offers a new guide Bumblina to replace the hideously irritating flying ferret-thing Bumble. For those interested, the choice of starter bears includes Grizzly, Cinnamon, Black, Glacier and Polar Bear cubs. (I don't know what the difference is between a glacier bear and a polar bear. You'll have to excuse my ignorance.)
 
It looks like the actual game will be largely the same, with similar mini-games and activities, but we've asked Microsoft for confirmation. It will be available as a downloadable add-on for existing Kinectimals owners, entitled Bear Island
