Aspen-ational

Bethenny decides it's time to give Jason an early Christmas present, but the gift backfires when Jason decides he may not be ready for all that it holds. When Bethenny brings up her obstacles with Jason to Dr. Amador for the first time, she understands it's time to take a step back and listen. Soon after, Bethenny leaves for the launch of the Skinnygirl Cranberry Cosmo in Aspen. Finally, when the idea of working together rears its ugly head again, Bethenny takes a lesson from Dr. Amador and learns to let Jason come to her instead of the other way around.
