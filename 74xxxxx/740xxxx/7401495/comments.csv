,krysoul,2012-07-12T09:03Z,"for those who couldn't start the episode-2 when clicking on PLAY option.
I had the sem prob too. when i clicked on play, the game just freezes but then i closed the game n den reopened it. later i simply clicked on rewind option and it shows chapter. just click on it and the game will start just fine. also, the save files from episode-1 is still intact i.e all my choices were saved (carlie-alive, doug-DEAD). but still got some prob. when a zombie attacks Lee while saving Kyle's wife, at some point the game just freezes and non of the clicking works. maybe u guyz can figure it out."
,roimoi,2012-07-12T18:36Z,Why are all the files in .ttarch format?  How do you install this?
,roimoi,2012-07-12T18:47Z,"I copied the files to the pack folder, ran episode 1, tried to continue my last save in the end of episode 1.  after a brief summary of what happened in episode 1, everything goes blank with strange sounds of like the zombies eating or something...I thought it is part of it, but this just played on and on for a very long time with nothing happening.

how do I fix this?"
,ShinkuEX,2012-07-15T01:12Z,"This is for everyone who are not having their decisions carried over:

It's a simple fix. Load up your saved game and pick Episode 1. 

Instead of clicking PLAY, click on REWIND and pick the last chapter, which is you talking to everyone at the Motor Inn. 

Play that chapter the way you did before, and go through the credits. 

Once you're back on the main menu, pick Episode 2 to play. 

You'll see all your reflecting choices on the prologue. Hope this helps you as it helped me."
,moosies,2012-07-16T00:30Z,"Bugged release, don't bother.
SPOILER:
When Mr. Parkers attacks you on the truck bed, there's no way for you to fend him off after kicking him in the face. The game simply cuts to Lee getting eaten, then bugs out and has Parker clipping through you."
,ShinkuEX,2012-07-16T04:18Z,"Sounds like you need to upgrade your drivers, moosies. This torrent works perfect for me."
,Dean.Winchester,2012-07-16T19:28Z,I'm getting the same issue as moosies... 
,countryraj,2012-07-17T11:27Z,"NOTICE :

@roimoi
Dont copy as the files into the ""PACK/DEFAULT"" folder like you copy the crack files in other games.

Copy the downloaded folder ie, "" THE WALKING DEAD 102 "" straight into the ""PACK"" folder. Now you will have 2 folders in ""PACK"" folder. ie, the ""DEFAULT"" folder & "" THE WALKING DEAD 102"" folder.
Now you can play the game."
,Malaris666,2012-07-18T22:40Z,I'm having audio issues. Voices come through but get no other sound. I see through the comments that others have had the same issue. Anyone got any idea how to fix it?
,Euro234,2012-07-20T14:19Z,"@moosies u have to hit Mr Parkers to the right or left, simply just move ur mouse "
,dookiebd,2012-07-22T02:07Z,"@Malaris666 i'm having the exact opposite of you.. no voices and only background sounds.. 

also, there's no way for me to hit the ESC key to bring up any sort of menu to save/exit the game.  I have to alt-f4 to close it.

any ideas on what could be wrong? ep 1 worked just fine."
,c6burns,2012-07-22T19:59Z,Dont be a complete fucking useless tool and write spoilers on the game puzzles in the goddamn comments of the torrent. If someone is stupid enough to  ask for them here instead of using google just ignore them.

,nexuszord,2012-08-01T12:27Z,"@JussiWarcon You installed Episode 2 Incorrectly, Read the top comments, you must put the folder into Pack, not the contents."
,zan154,2012-08-02T16:37Z,This torrent is not working. I copied WalkingDead102 to the patch folder (not the default folder) and i've tried starting where my save is which is at the very end of ep1 and it still acts as if ep2 is not installed.
,veton1x,2012-08-13T18:33Z,"it worked to me in this way:

rename WalkingDead102 folder to ""default"", then delete the original ""default"" folder of Episode 1, now Start  the game from the last saved game, it will start automatically on the new chapter or episode 2.   Hope it will work. Cheers"

,c0ugar_08,2012-09-04T11:27Z,"there was a bit problem i encountered on the game .. when i'm playing the game the ESC button won't respond so i have to  press alt+f4 to close the game.. plus the hints on the upper left of the screen doesn't appear... and there are some place or parts of the game that the character ""lee"" can't move or get stuck especially on the barn when i'm checking on the stables...

 how can i fix this... do i need to erase the files that i have pasted on the default folder?"
,g4laxy,2012-09-14T19:23Z,"All right, so I'm having some trouble with this.  I was playing through ep 2 and quit out of the game.  When I came back to it later, the game had some trouble loading, so I restarted my computer and the game loaded fine, but my save was gone.  It doesn't even recognize that I've played the game at all, it's like I opened it for the very first time.  How can I get my saves back so I can continue with the game?"
