                         Hardcore Pawn | s00 | XviD


truTV has this thing for showing a pilot and then months later if it went well you can find season 1 on the schedule. With Hardcore Pawn there are two such episodes. They were shown on 21 December 2009. They are absent from every torrent of HCP i have ever found. But they are listed on Wikipedia, IMDb, and similar sites. 

If you are going through some HCP withdrawal here is a little tease that probably won't hold you over until season 6 but, hey, it's only 2 episodes. 

After some time on direct download i thought it time to bring them over here for those who prefer torrents.
