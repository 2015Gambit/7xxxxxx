Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 98 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "

,Benishdamenish,2012-07-03T23:55Z,"@babybluetits24, I absolutely agree and second that. People should seed for one week, or at least 48 hours."
,(hotrodder),2012-07-04T02:56Z,"i seed 24/7 on everything i get, i have one in my finished from jan. that I'm still seeding, doesn't hurt your bandwidth so -why not right.
 on certain files i can download in seconds because of that, so, ya, great advice!"
,RaveHippie,2012-07-04T07:22Z,does seeedin rely not effect ur bandwith???
,mrulrich,2012-07-04T12:22Z,"hawkman57: of course uploading/seeding will affect your upstream bandwidth... What do you think, that the uploadrate is made out of small butterflies flying from your computer to their destination?"
,coolhanddool,2012-07-04T18:43Z,"When you are allowed only a certain amount of MB or GB per month on downloading and uploading, which seeding is part of uploading, you cannot afford to seed."
,willytakum,2012-07-04T19:28Z,"Seeding Definetly effects your DL speed...does anyone think there is a seperate cable that transmits uploads? Sure, it's a different process but only a moron would say that it doesn't ""crowd"" your bandwidth...plz...if you don't KNOW...keep your fuckin' mouth shut...dis-information is just lying...stop trying to be a super-tech here...for those of us that know better, you are only showing your ignorance"
