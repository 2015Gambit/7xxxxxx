Any chance for new releases soon?
thx"
,crossmr,2012-08-15T09:21Z,"This says complete, but it is not. For example, the first Paper Mini PDF I checked seems to be missing several pages. The description of the burnt offerings mini states 80 different minis, but the pdf is a single page with only 26 total. Also several of the paper minis are missing. The store page lists 41 different PDFs available, but there are only 13 in the file, only about a third. Lots here, but some stuff missing. "
,_jones,2012-08-17T01:50Z,"@futuregary - Can you suggest a good blocklist? I'm using the blocker native to Transmission, I'd really like this torrent but I obviously don't want to get entangled with any of that shit."
,elmalvado,2012-08-26T18:08Z,"@darkok - There are no new releases because of troubles with hidden watermarks in Paizo pdfs. We're still waiting for someone to dewatermark July & August books.

@crossmr - It's complete when it comes to core books, modules, APs, chronicles, bestiaries & companions. I don't care for PF society, decks, maps and minis. Sorry to disappoint you."
,crossmr,2012-08-30T16:18Z,"@elmalvado That's fine I guess, just the title is a bit misleading. I guess when I hear complete, I would expect everything. It's just odd to me how you ended up with the first page of a PDF and not the whole thing. Was it just a sample or something? The paperminis would be handy for me, as I'm living somewhere where I don't have access to a lot of RPG materials now and I was hoping to use those. I'll dig around though maybe someone else uploaded them somewhere. "
,crossmr,2012-08-30T16:20Z,"What about the paper minis that go with the adventure paths? I mean if you want to have the complete adventure paths could you at least toss in those PDFs? I don't know know how you're getting these, if you're buying them yourself and sharing them or finding them elsewhere, but if you do have access to them, I'd appreciate them. Thanks!"
