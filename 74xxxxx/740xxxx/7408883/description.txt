DESCRIPTION:

The current level of popular interest in health and behavior reinforces the urgent need for better information so practitioners, academics, and the public can perform research and make lifestyle choices based on sound science. 
From adherence to a doctorΓÇÖs advice, to emotions and health, to obesity treatment and prevention, to womenΓÇÖs health and all topics in between, the Encyclopedia of Health and Behavior comprehensively covers all aspects of what has become the dynamic domain of behavioral medicine.

This A-to-Z Encyclopedia was designed with the overarching goal to collect together in a single resource the knowledge generated by this interdisciplinary field, highlighting the links between science and practice. 
In it, scholars, health care practitioners, and the general public will find a wealth of information on topics such as physical activity, stress and health, smoking, pain management, social support and health, cardiovascular health, health promotion, and HIV/AIDS. 
This two-volume set includes over 200 entries on topics covering all aspects of health and behavior. In addition, the Encyclopedia of Health and Behavior includes a comprehensive set of additional resources with both entries on selected organizations and an appendix with a detailed annotated listing of such organizations as well as Web sites of interest.
