:___[RELEASE NOTES]_______________________________________:

     From Sleeve: "International celebrity
     DJ/producer/remixer Danny Tenaglia
     returns to the forefront of clubland
     with his first new recording since the
     succesful "Ohno" over one year ago.
     The first track from his forthcoming
     full-length LP, "Elements"
     is an epic house track in pure Danny
     fashion.Dark, moody, and true Tenaglia,
    "Elements" dissects the making of a
     house track, as demonstrated by one of
     the masters of the craft. Five mixes
     cover all the bases: vocal mix, chant mix,
     dub mix, extended bonus beats and acappella.
     Picking up where "Ohno" and his classic
    "Bottom Heavy"leave off, "Elements"
     is certain to become one of the
     crown jewels in Tenaglia's musical crown,
     and one of Twisted's shining moments!"
     Mastered at Frankford Wayne Mastering
     Labs, NYC.Special thanks goes to:
     Joey Nieves, Kevin McHugh,
     Lula, Marcello, Joe Ulloa,
     Chuck Aronson, Adolpho,
     Ramon and to all my new friends at DTour
