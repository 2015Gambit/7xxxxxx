""One thing government should handle is defense...but to what extent?""

Even their priorities are not sacred...the Right is truly doomed to a self-destructive race to the bottom. The sad thing is how far from reality they really are. They'll still be occupied with their self-inflicted defense problems when the all the other problems that should have equal priority come home to roost..."
