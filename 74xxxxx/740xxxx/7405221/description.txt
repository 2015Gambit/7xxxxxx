This Dover edition, first published in 1979, is an unabridged and corrected republication of the second enlarged (1969) edition of the English translation lirsl published by Corvina Press, Budapest, in 1966 under the title Chess Olympiads. The work was originally published in Hungarian in 1958 by Pub Sport (Medicina, Budapest).
Gens una sumus! This was the motto adopted by F. I. D. É., and the series of Chess Olympiads which has lasted many years serves as positive proof of it. Over fifty nations now send their players every two years; every continent has been represented. Almost all the World Champions and contenders for the title have taken part in the Olympiads, not to mention numerous grandmasters and international masters, the 'common soldiers' of chess. Differences disappear over the chessboard; aristocrats by birth, fortune, or intellect are found side by side with those who have had to make a hard living as, for example, cabmen, fishermen, or waiters. There are players who devote most of their lives to chess and travel, while others, of amateur status, must largely confine their international appearances to the Olympiads. The Chess Olympiads are becoming more and more popular, but the singleness of purpose of the participants remains the same; namely, to be worthy representa-tives of their country in a noble contest.

This is one of my old & rare chess books that I have scanned for you. I had bought it almost 30 years back & it is still in perfect condition. Full cross-tables & individual player scores of teams are given along with a large number of games in descriptive notation for each olympiad.
