A trio from Israel which doesn't fit into any mould of mainstream music.


In 2009 drummer tomer tzur and guitarist Gidon Schocken met in ΓÇ£MuzikΓÇ¥, a music production school. Combined with bass player Lior Yarkoni the first project was created. In the end of 2010 bass player Lior Yarkoni left the band, and was replaced by singer- songwriter Orly Eittan. A new and different style emerged, ΓÇ£futuristic old school all night flightΓÇ¥.
