,fragnito,2012-07-04T18:07Z,"dude, you are consistently amazing! thanks so much for the time and effort you put in. i don't want to request but was wondering if you're gonna upload batman begins and dark knight to go with the dark knight rising being released. "
[T],tr108,2012-07-06T00:05Z,@fragnito - BB & TDK will be up in about a week
,Tyron083,2012-07-08T20:19Z,i really doubt there is anybody else on all the net that have better quality. i tried ur preset with handbrake but quality is nowhere near as good as your's. so i decided to leave it to the master.
,Tyron083,2012-07-08T20:22Z,"one thing. 
can you do some new releases pls"
[T],tr108,2012-07-11T00:51Z,"@Tyron083 - I know I've been slacking on new releases and it's (unfortunately) gonna be a little light on all releases these next few weeks.

I tried to reply to your email, but it kept bouncing back. Anyways, you can peep the presets I use for HandBrake (these are updated & include basic instructions) at

A lot depends on the source file you use, of course, I've been ripping directly from BDs recently. Also, you gotta use the Nightly Builds of HB, 0.9.6 won't work so well..."
[T],tr108,2012-07-11T01:38Z,"Btw, Tyron083, I've had some success with adding sub with YAMB (on a PC) but the big caveat is the file can't have any other text tracks (so no chapters) and only a single audio track (so probably only AAC) and any metadata (movie name, cover art) is stripped out and needs to be added again."
