   The day after London won the Olympic bid, terrorists attacked the public
 transport network killing 52 people and injuring over 700. Seven years
 later, as the eyes of the world are once again focused on the capital,
 '7/7: One Day in London' gathers the testimony of over 50 people directly 
 affected by the bombings, exploring the long lasting effects as they reflect
 on their experiences and how their lives have changed.After the conclusion
 of the public inquest in 2011, a multitude of previously untold stories 
 emerged of the bravery, difficulties and horror that people experienced
 on that day in 2005; many of these have been included in this film as well
 as testimony from people who have never spoken publically before. 
 This is an ambitious retelling of the story of what happened on that day, 
 with contributions from commuters, emergency service workers, TFL 
 staff and families of victims. With enormous compassion for one another, 
 ordinary people tell extraordinary stories of the day when they were thrown
 together, and their struggle to cope in the wake of the blasts that shook     London.
