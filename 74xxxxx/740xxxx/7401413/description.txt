Plot: The whole ΓÇ£zombie thingΓÇ¥ has been hyped up so much that everyone thinks itΓÇÖs the end of the world! Of course, where one man sees the dead rising from the grave, another sees opportunity. Q had a plan: drive the robbery getaway van, deliver everyone to the safe house and get paid ΓÇô a nice, simple, plan. Unfortunately, life is never really that simple, and to top it all off, this is the first time Q has been a getaway driver. HeΓÇÖs coping pretty well though, considering; TONY (the guy who is ΓÇÿin chargeΓÇÖ of the job) is a murderous nut case, DANNY was shot and is now bleeding all over the money in the back of the van, the Sat-Nav has a mind of its own, thereΓÇÖs a guy in the back living up to his name ΓÇ£CRAZY STEVEΓÇ¥, the safe-house already has police at it, and this whole ΓÇ£zombie thingΓÇ¥ seems to be quickly becoming more of a ΓÇ£zombie apocalypse thingΓÇ¥ΓÇª
