,wharfrat22,2012-07-03T15:47Z,NICE :)
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T00:51Z,SEED MOFOs SEED!!
,EdgarS789,2012-07-04T01:04Z,"How about YOU seed, MOFO. This guy's uploaded this same file three times, except it can't really be the same file or it would have the same hash. All three copies of this 1.35 GB file by this UNTRUSTED uploader have plenty of peers but NO SEEDS.  I smell a prank to get suckers to waste internet."
,meeped,2012-07-04T03:27Z,"I have 87% of the file and it's not a prank.  I can watch whats downloaded so far.
The copy is decent enough. 
Nice job wharfrat22, thanks."
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T03:42Z,"Hey Edgar, do you really think I'd spend two days trying to upload this for some ""prank?"" Ive been trying to share this but I'm not sure what the deal is. AND I have been seeding for 2 days homchicken, so shut ya mouth.  I'm doing this to share not for trickery.  I'll admit i may have done something wrong because its my first time trying to upload a torrent, but I followed the directions to a tee. If you have an idea why this is happening Sir Edgar please feel free to share, instead of being a conspiring douche.    "
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T03:44Z,THANKS MEEPED!! My plan to overthrow the inter-webs has been foiled!!! ARRGHHH!
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T03:50Z,I really do suck at this though. Sorry...
,muddicks,2012-07-04T06:03Z,It appears everyone is stuck on 88%
[M],BigDadE,2012-07-04T09:48Z,Please do not upload duplicate content.  The other uploads of this have been deleted.
,EdgarS789,2012-07-04T10:07Z,"Now Vuze tells me the file has two seeds, but neither is active, and none of the peers has over 88.7%. I tried, but can't play the partially downloaded file with Quicktime. So tell us how you did it, if you want us to believe you.

The file has a note that it was downloaded from another site, but I can't find it there. Pretty suspicious."
,rzilla1,2012-07-04T13:42Z,Edgar the partial file plays in VLC. its legit
,EdgarS789,2012-07-04T16:20Z,"OK, thanks for that advice. I confirm the partial file tries to play in VLC and looks legit and a good show. I also note that the file is now at 89.1% complete, up slightly from 88.7%. So maybe you are trying to seed. You asked for my advice. Here it is. This is for Vuze. continued..."
,jeffwin,2012-07-04T16:29Z,I'm stuck at 89.1% and what I played so far looks good.
,EdgarS789,2012-07-04T16:37Z,"Limit upload connections to two. This is the fastest way to create more seeds. If you're seeding anything else, severely limit upload speeds on those other files. With Vuze I can limit the upload speed of a collection of files to 1Kbps. Allow unlimited upload speed for this file. For further dialog, I've opened a thread ""Jim Norton PLEASE BE OFFENDED"" on the Suprbay forum."
,meeped,2012-07-04T18:58Z,"yes that would be great if you could do as edgar has suggested and limit the number of people you are uploading to, otherwise this download will take a week."
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T20:00Z,"I will try and do that now.  Edgar the only reason it has the other sites txt file id because I uploaded it over there too. This has really turned out to be a pain, when all I wanted to do was share this..."
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T20:07Z,"dude, I'm trying to sign up on suprbay but it keeps asking me to fill in the image verification but its not showing anything? No captcha, no Q and A type thing, nothing?"
,wharfrat22,2012-07-04T20:10Z,"I GOT IT, it was Chrome. "
,itsavirus,2012-07-05T00:35Z,seed.....
,ZebTheCyClops,2012-07-05T01:01Z,i just made an account so i could ask you to seed this damn thing!! i'm at 89.1% downloading at 0.3 kb/sec
,jeffwin,2012-07-05T04:01Z,i've been stuck at 89.1% for hours.
,EdgarS789,2012-07-05T04:22Z,"Suprbay wants us to use PM's. I have sent you a PM. Please reply to that, and I will try to help you."
,EdgarS789,2012-07-05T04:25Z,Suprbay wants us to use Private Messages. I have seent one to you. Please reply and I will try to helpl you.
,ZebTheCyClops,2012-07-05T20:42Z,what the hell happened to the seeders? and who do i PM?
,EdgarS789,2012-07-05T22:38Z,"I'm EdgarS777 on Suprbay, but I only have 89.1% of the file like all of you. I think wharfrat22 has the only complete copy. I think he's trying to seed, but something's wrong and no data is beeing sent. I thing his ID on Suprbay is wharfart22; note slight spelling change. I haven't received any reply to my PM to him some hours ago.

,keithh85,2012-07-06T03:31Z,Uploader got it finally on the other site. I got the file and seeding it and only it until this torrent takes off. Major thanks to WHARFRAT22!!
,ZebTheCyClops,2012-07-06T03:40Z,"my download just picked up to 300 kb/s and it has 13 min to go, i'll seed until it's ""old"" or there are better versions of it"
,keithh85,2012-07-06T03:42Z,Not sure why I don't see my comment anymore... TPB kinda sucks BUT WHARFRAT22 got the rest of it uploaded and this should take off now. A lot of people have it 100% downloaded and seeded. Thanks again uploader
,keithh85,2012-07-06T03:43Z,Now I see my comment. WTF this site sucks... Old reliable though. I wouldn't have this without this site. Or really demon.... oid.... dot.... com.... 
,ZebTheCyClops,2012-07-06T04:04Z,finally finished! i'm seeding and already converting to iphone 4s 1080p
,keithh85,2012-07-06T05:49Z,Care to upload your converted file? .mov is not convenient for me but it will do until someone uploads something better
,ZebTheCyClops,2012-07-06T18:38Z,"the video is almost too laggy. i prefer to have mp3S of standup.. but i can upload ""apple iPhone 4 HD  1280x720 if you like."
