,BayGhost,2012-07-16T09:36Z,"Guys, here are little pointers for those of you who are confused about installing this game and how to do it. First off when you download, you'll see 27 .rar files. Just right click the first one -> Extract here. You'll then get the .iso file. Mount it via any image mounting program (MagicDisk, DEAMON Tools...), and run the setup. If you played the first episode, and want to continue from where you left off, all you have to do is have the first episode installed on your computer, and install the second episode in the same folder as the first one. It should automatically create a subfolder, and when you start the second episode just clikc play, the game will offer you to choose your saved game, and you pick up right where you left off, with all of your choices saved. Good luck survivors ! "
