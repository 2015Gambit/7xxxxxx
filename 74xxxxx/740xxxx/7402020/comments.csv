,baybeh,2012-07-01T10:57Z,"Hi Auge, Straw Dogs Criterion disc 1 is here, though terribly seeded. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4556271/Straw_Dogs_(1971)_CRITERION_NTSC_DVD9_Disc_1
I'm downloading it myself and it hasn't budged even a bit in days."
,russell1nash,2012-07-01T12:59Z,"once again, a great classic upload! "
,disimagery2,2012-07-01T14:53Z,"Auge, how do I contact you regarding 'getting you what you want' off the 'want list' mentioned...they are available."
[T],Auge,2012-07-01T19:55Z,"disimagery2 
If you are at Demonoid you can IM me.
If not let me know, maybe work something out."
[T],Auge,2012-07-02T00:50Z,"I got this disc last week; an officemate had four Criterion Collection DVDs that I did not have:

WR: Mysteries of the Organism
Hard Boiled
The Silence of the Lambs
How to Get Ahead In Advertising 



They were all still in shrink-wrap and all but one was out of print.
This incredibly cool officemate let me peal the wrappers off and rip the discs . . . pretty cool huh?


I have yet to watch the extras, but am looking forward to it.


I watched this one when it came out in theaters, I was 21 years old and living in the University District of Seattle I was young, single and worked and lived within walking distance of three cinemas so I watched a lot of film. These cinemas are ran by Landmark Theaters, both then and now they are the place to go for art house, foreign and festival films."
