Mitch McVicker is a GMA Dove Award-winning Contemporary Christian Music singer-songwriter. In the early 1990's he met and befriended the late Rich Mullins.  By 1995 Mitch began touring and writing songs with Mullins.   On the night of September 19, 1997, McVicker and Mullins were en route to a benefit concert being held in Wichita, Kansas, and were involved in a serious auto accident after the Jeep they were riding in flipped and ejected both occupants. McVicker was seriously injured while Mullins instantly died at the scene after being hit by a semi-trailer truck.
