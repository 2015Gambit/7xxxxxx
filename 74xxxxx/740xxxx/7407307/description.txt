J. D. Crowe & The New South is an album by American banjo player J. D. Crowe and The New South, released in 1975 (see 1975 in music). It was reissued on CD in 1992.

After Bluegrass Evolution, Ricky Skaggs replaced Larry Rice and Jerry Douglas joined the group for this eponymously titled album, more commonly known by its Rounder Records catalogue number ("Rounder 0044"). Stylisticly, this album marked a sharp turn from Bluegrass Evolution as the majority of the album traditional bluegrass instrumentation on songs by up-and-coming singer-songwriters such as Gordon Lightfoot, Utah Phillips and Rodney Crowell, as well as incorporating traditional songs.
