The Tolvan Big Band is one of Scandinavia's most experienced big bands. Located in Malmö, in southern Sweden, this orchestra has been working since 1979 and, under saxophonist/musical director Helge Albin, has collaborated with notable Americans such as Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Liebman and Michael Brecker, British composer Mike Westbrook and Danish saxophonist Lars Møller - the band has even dedicated one of its programs to new arrangements of the John Lennon/Paul McCartney songbook.

On Tarantula Suite, reed player Cennet Jönsson takes the leadership. Jönsson composed and arranged an impressive eight-movement suite that stresses this big band's masterful collective musicianship and warm sound. Jönsson is a versatile composer and his compositions use the group's powerhouse energy and tight interplay, and its members' broad musical knowledge. (allaboutjazz.com)
