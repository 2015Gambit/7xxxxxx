The third release in the Celestial Bodies series, a 12-month galactic collaboration between Ruined Machines and artist Michal Brodka spanning the entire Solar System and beyond. 

Enter Celestial Bodies, chapter three: Venus. The goal for this month was to tell the story of Venus through one longer piece of music, rather than multiple smaller tracks, as "Mercury" and "The Sun" have been. Venus is meant to encapsulate a thick, warm vibe, while utilizing production methods so far unseen in Ruined Machines work. Mike's visual counterpart is the result of almost an entire month's worth of illustrators' block. As far as the final product goes, it looks like we both rose above our respective artistic pitfalls on this one. 


We are next in space.
