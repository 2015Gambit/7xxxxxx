,ejkul,2012-07-03T10:15Z,"ok maybe i did something wrong, but the casino does not appear in my game. all the objects are there, like the blackjack table and slotmachines, but there is no lot to be placed. is it working for anyone else?"
,kakosenazvati,2012-07-03T11:57Z,"Oh... My... God... Thank you very, very, VERY MUCH!!!!! I LOVE this update, and the fixes are working!!!"

,Simmer4Ever,2012-07-03T18:34Z,"@admz0r Hi !! You are THE BEST on uploading store content and I ALWAYS download from you and seed for hours! But my stuff in-game DONT WORK :( !! Like whenever I want to use the fryer or ice cream (mexican set) the fryer stays on and my sim doesnt eat anything and the ice cream machine doesnt give ice cream AT ALL :( !! Also the new ""Multi-Tab"" doesnt work too ! Oh and the stuff arent in-place, theyre always on the side not showing! So can you PLEASE help!!"
,minaluv,2012-07-03T21:13Z,Hi everyone this is my first time using the torrents will someone please walk me through this i heard and see that you have the best torrents so will you explain to me what i have to do to get these to work 
,minaluv,2012-07-04T00:06Z,Is there anybody who can tell me why it says no able to install why is that 
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-07-04T00:43Z,for those who can't install the content except for the objects it's because your game needs to be updated that's what mine said...i tried to install the casino and it said unable to install game needs to be updated or something like that :/
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-07-04T00:48Z,"just try it try  highlight all the files from the folder ""Sim3pack.Files"" given by admz0r, then right click and open.
Wait until it's done and you will see that it says that the casino and some other files failed to install and few files succeed to install :/
BTW good torrent admz0r thanks "
,Puxes,2012-07-04T01:54Z,"@Simmer4ever 

REAAD THE  DESCRIPTIONS FOR NOW ON!!
All u have to do is read."
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-07-04T03:09Z,"sorry to bother but i updated my game to 1.34 and when i install the content i get ""Installation failed: please make sure your game has latest software updates"" :/.."

,Puxes,2012-07-05T04:22Z,"@Simkelly 
he does these every month being that sims 3 store releases new content every month."
,SimKelly91,2012-07-05T18:49Z,"@Puxes, UR STUPID...... U don't even know what I am talking about!!!  I thanked him for listening to my comment/favour in the ""Lucky Palms"" download page, to which I told him to fix all the errors on the new world. And that's exactly what he added in this package (a fixer that fixes all the error). That's the reason why I'm thanking him!!!!  GOT IT????!!"
,Puxes,2012-07-06T03:48Z,"@Simkelly91 

First of all, I didn't insult you so don't insult me. 
Now, Admz0r always posts fixes because most of the time some things don't work with the premium content. 

So next time calm your little ass down because its not that serious."
,marieoriole,2012-07-06T05:10Z,ok i'm having the same problems....is there something i'm missing?? i read the entire description and i'm not getting anywhere...keeps saying i need to update my game but it's completely up to date...i'm so confused! please help me!! 
,andre_ss6,2012-07-07T07:50Z,"can you make a compilation of all your updates, please?"
,admz0r,2012-07-07T14:40Z,at the end of 2012 :)
,gtahalo137,2012-07-08T07:36Z,Sorry but how do I get it work exactly? I paste all the fixers and the store content package at overrides and I just launch it. The store in Sims 3 still need to buy it with simpoint....
,drod1596,2012-07-09T22:31Z,Thank you so much for always uploading!
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-07-11T09:11Z,"@gtahalo i get the same thing, don't look at the simpoints objects look for the objects that you downloaded they are there! believe me "
,Duross,2012-07-13T19:08Z,Where is the overrides folder? I just don't know where to put all the package files. This is the first time im getting store items so if someone could help me learn these package files id be really great full.
,tpdoll91,2012-07-15T03:47Z,"These download great, except how do I fix the items from last month? I am using a Macbook Pro. Has anybody been able to figure this out?"
,admz0r,2012-07-18T10:26Z,@Duross: http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files
,McCoco,2012-07-28T09:02Z,Exactly when is July coming out? I cant wait!!! These are so completely amazing!!!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!!!
,McCoco,2012-07-28T09:04Z,"Will you also be doing the mystery bundles? And do you only do the stores hottest stuff, or will you do torrents on all store contents?"
,dasnawq789,2012-07-28T16:29Z,"im really noob at this 
so i wan to ask
in the previous update may,april,etc
there is .sims3pack and .package files
do i need to install both file or just choose either of its?"
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-07-29T09:04Z,@dasnawq789 choose one of them because it might double the items ..just saying
,dasnawq789,2012-07-30T14:46Z,"@XXjeanpierreXX
oh thnx a lot"
,dasnawq789,2012-07-31T17:35Z,"@admz0r or someone understand this
'cuse me i got a little confused
in the description admz0r says ""!!!! WARNING !!!! IF YOU'RE GETTING MY SET'S FROM MONTH TO MONTH, YOU MUST DELETE FROM YOUR PACKAGES THE ""Lunar_Lakes-Tree_of_Prosperity_(FiX)"" (FROM FEBRUARY UPD) BECAUSE THE NEW FIX ALREADY INCLUDES THAT FIX TOO, AND IF YOU KEEP IT, THEY GOING TO CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. !!!!""
and so when i checking my february update there is no such a file
because im downloading from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7063472/The_Sims_3_Store-February_2012_Update_%28.package%29
sorry its a little long"
,Puxes,2012-07-31T20:03Z,July set tomorrow!
,TakaiSama,2012-07-31T21:30Z,"I've updated my pirate bay bookmark to go straight to your upload list.

,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-07-31T23:18Z,@dasnawq789 you should download admz0r February update then just follow his instructions :)
,admz0r,2012-08-01T22:23Z,"yes ,sorry, u can find it in the february .sim3pack update only, because i forgot to include in the .package torrent.. sorry again about that, but u no longer need that :)"
,dasnawq789,2012-08-02T17:42Z,"@admz0r
