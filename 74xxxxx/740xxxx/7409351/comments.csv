,Darkdragontc,2012-07-03T19:08Z,"Can you get the newest version or close to it, i had problems with 4.9.2 before, unless this fixed the problem , then i will try it out."
,BagOfMoney,2012-07-03T19:47Z,"I found a great station on this app Tapinradio..

The station is: Urban Hitz Radio at 

http://www.urbanradiousa.com

I think the guy who runs it said that he uses SAM 4.90 or something like that. He said that SAM 4.9.2 had crashed for months, so he was unwilling to change back. I did not release this torrent, I simply searched long and hard at a pastebin for this.

Anyway check out that Radio station: Urban Hitz Radio, they play Urban Music, like Hip-Hop, etc."
,BagOfMoney,2012-07-03T19:51Z,I hope everyone enjoy and lets the community know how it is working out :) Have a great week...

,Darkdragontc,2012-07-04T06:44Z,"it works so far, just i hope you get the newest version or close to it"
,vandalschism,2012-07-04T09:08Z,I did. The patch says that the included file is the wrong file size :-/ I'm not sure what that means. Any suggestions?
,TooLonger,2012-07-04T16:58Z,Has the same crashing issue as every other 4.9.2 release - it's the only reason I haven't upgraded.
,Darkdragontc,2012-07-12T03:27Z,"This version doesn't work anymore, you need to find the higher version."
,bigbigbuddy,2012-07-15T04:05Z,@vandalschism Open the .nfo file with a text opener like WordPad.

,MadDogLive,2012-08-07T04:28Z,"BagOfMoney, would you mind telling us his site, or where we can find more keys from him? BTW, thank you so much for uploading this torrent!"

,BagOfMoney,2012-08-13T18:53Z,"Just a Tip, please stop using MySQL. That's the problems if SAM crashes. Use the default configuration for Firebird that comes shipped with SAM."
,MadDogLive,2012-09-01T17:42Z,"Thank you very much BagOfMoney! And yes, FreeStreamHosting is a very good site for any Internet radio station."
