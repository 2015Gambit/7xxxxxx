The Paulo family has been performing in circuses since the 1800s, and theirs is run by Big Kenny with the help of his wife Kath and their three sons.

Kenny Junior and his wife Teddi both perform in the circus, but they have a four-year-old daughter and, as she approaches school age, they must decide whether a life on the road is right for them. Ringmaster Leigh, Big Kenny's middle son, has fallen in love with a girl from outside the circus. She does not want him to travel, so could his future with the circus be coming to an end? As Big Kenny fights to keep the circus together, will 21st-century pressures force the family off the road? Narrated by Bradley Walsh .GUIDANCE: Contains strong language.
