QED 36 - Unnamed Spectral line

The equilateral geometry behind an un-named spectral line as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The equilateral geometry that dictates the specific energies relating to a previously un-named spectral series line is revealed completing the total emission/absorption line series possible for any atomic nuclei.

The specific energy required to achieve the electron transition in Hydrogen nuclei is explained in terms of its Tetryonic geometry, along with the revelation of how the Math reflects the Tetryonic geometry of the associated KEM field of the electron.

The thirty-sixth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
