This download was a solid effort, considering it's a cam. You seriously cannot tell that this is cam quality. No shaking, buriness, or random dudes walking across the screen. Very well done. 

Now the audio is another story. Some of you VLC pros might make the necessary tweeks. I couldn't.

Honestly, the movie wasn't good enough to stick through it or make the attempt to adjust the audio settings. "
