,hbobby,2012-07-02T06:04Z,so... this is my first torrent ever. If anyone has any tips on how to make it recognize that I am uploading from my computer.. would be nice...
,hbobby,2012-07-02T06:07Z,update: if you give it about 5 minutes it will pick up and start downloading. and I am uploading at 2mb/s
,hbobby,2012-07-02T06:08Z,"by the way, if anyone prefers a folder with each image rather than a rar for whatever reason. let me  know for consideration in the following torrents. "
,hbobby,2012-07-02T15:42Z,"ahh! A TYPO! the file says 260,0000 but its really 260,000. so.... sorry about that, it doesnt affect the actual images. =("
