In a land ravaged by disparity where the impoverished
must battle for survival, the fate of all is thrust into
uncertainty when rebels happen upon custody of a young
female noble and a magical spear of immeasurable power
falls from the heavens. Now, hunted by incumbent powers
desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon
capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage
war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their
oppressors.

As original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG
mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly
honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue
of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have
a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster
actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede
slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they
may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more
combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This
classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting
titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and
gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.
