QED 27 ΓÇô Photo-kinetics

The equilateral geometry behind Photo-kinetics as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Pair production and the kinetic energies of photoelectrons are explained providing a geometric model for the source of RydbergΓÇÖs formula and the constant that bears his name.

Quantum level differentials are revealed in geometric form and applied the emission/absorption lines of atomic nuclei.

The twenty-seventh chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
