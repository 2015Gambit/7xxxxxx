,dreadlocks,2012-07-03T22:24Z,"correct episode, thanks.. its window boxed and quality is not the best but its better than nothing.. thanks, seeding full blast"
,360PytoN,2012-07-03T22:25Z,"Icurnvs, Epguides.com says 

S05E05 aired 22/Jun/12   Into the Belly of the Beast
and
S0506 aired 29/Jun/12   Crossing the Line 

Your episode is E06 according to Epgudies, where is E05 then :S can't find either E05 or E06 on the entire internet."
,minde345,2012-07-03T22:29Z,its the right episode !:D but its not widescreen but the audio quality is good :D
,icurnvs,2012-07-03T22:31Z,@360pyton there is a lot of confusion with a lot of sources on the numbering scheme for the episodes. whale wars released a pre-season episode that was labeled E00 but some websites list the preseason episode as E01 Amazon had this website listed as E05 so that is what i labeled it as
,celik4146,2012-07-03T22:33Z,"Correct episode, will continue to seed, thanks uploader :)"
,360PytoN,2012-07-03T22:34Z,"My bad, this is E05 as the title says, EPGuides are retarded, they listed a E00 so that made it all fuzzy."

,praw,2012-07-04T14:25Z,I've been stuck at 27.4% with 0 seeds connected and 0 in swarm for the last 24 hrs. Anyone else having this issue?
,Vampir8,2012-07-04T14:30Z,Thanks for the up. Much appreciated.
,thecat18,2012-07-04T20:37Z,Thanks for sharing.
,praw,2012-07-05T01:00Z,"For those of you stuck at 27%, just delete that torrent and re-download. The 800mb file is dead, the new one is around 400mb and its seeded. I guess someone changed something along the way."
,luizsal,2012-07-05T01:26Z,"Donwload was great. icurnvs, you're the man!!!
Have seeded over 1GB already of it.
The bad thing is that this episode sucks... Kind of a longer continuation of 4!!! The first 42 minutes out of the 44 minutes could be resumed as ""a previously on Whale Wars"".
Like they said, Paul Watson is the only guy in the world who is trying to ruin his own reality show!"
,seediii,2012-07-05T10:19Z,Thank you!!  Have been looking for this for days...
,mdtrey12,2012-07-05T16:29Z,"It asks me for a password (like other crappy torrent sites), read me file is regular monkey crap.  I have never seen this on PB.  What is the password?"
,mdtrey12,2012-07-05T16:43Z,"Nevermind..wrong one..Awesome, got it... seeding now!"
,HomuHomu,2012-07-06T15:27Z,Lets hope we get episode 6 tomorrow(Saturday)(It airs today)
,japhater,2012-07-07T02:45Z,"this episode was only uploaded tonight by tv team and 1 or 2 other green skulls, so sadly i reckon they are all a week behind.. ICURNVS we need you lol please up episode 6"
,far_kit,2012-07-08T01:24Z,And this is AVI not H264 much appreciated
