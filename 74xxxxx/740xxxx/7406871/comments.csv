However the celebration part is a bit short. It does not have the player's kids joining in the celebrations on pitch!! Does your other 720p upload have it??

I wish you uploaded ""Collectors Edition"" version with the pre match, game, trophy, celebration like ur Champions League Final 8gb pack!!

Big fan of urs! Keep up the good work!! "
