QED 24 - Matter waves

The equilateral geometry behind deBroglie Matter waves as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Many of the material wave-particle properties of Matter: De Broglie Waves, Compton frequencies, Matter waves are explained for the first time using Tetryonic geometries 

The revelation of the true geometry behind quantum probabilities in EM waves and Matter is revealed along with an explanation of the mysteries behind Electron energy and spin.

The twenty-fourth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
