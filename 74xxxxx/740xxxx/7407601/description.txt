QED 25 ΓÇô Photons

The equilateral geometry behind Photons as derived from  Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Covering Photons specifically, it reveals the geometric properties of all Photonic bundles of EM energy.

EM field Frequency, wavelength, and the speed of Energy (along with it momenta vectors) are all related back to the equilateral geometry of Quantised Angular Momenta and a unification of all of these properties is achieved for the first time in recorded history.

The twenty-fifth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
