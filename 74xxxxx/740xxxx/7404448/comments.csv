[S],velvet.,2012-07-02T04:39Z,"Why does your torrent contain a ZIP file?
Video files are not compressible, so there is no point in ZIPing them.

Why not simply create a normal video torrent consisting of an appropriately named folder containing the video episodes?

And why did you set the anonymous flag on your torrent upload, and then go and post a comment on your own torrent?

,Maave,2012-07-02T05:32Z,"-Why does your torrent contain a ZIP file?
Because I couldn't extract it with the names intact, like I said in the description.

-Video files are not compressible, so there is no point in ZIPing them.
Depends on the compression of the videos. WMV is not very good. This archive has an 89% ratio and it RARs better.

-Why not simply create a normal video torrent consisting of an appropriately named folder containing the video episodes?
Couldn't extract properly.

-And why did you set the anonymous flag on your torrent upload, and then go and post a comment on your own torrent?
I found a solution to my unpacking problem quickly, I wasn't expecting that. I could make another torrent but a few people already have this one, not many people will care beyond the group downloading it now."
,Maave,2012-07-02T05:34Z,And I doubt anybody would have noticed the time on the comment had you not said anything. It would have just looked like a regular post.

That didnt work for me under Windows 7 64bit, using 64bit WinRAR, unless you mean change it completely to Japanese (and not just using applocale software)"
,Maave,2012-07-21T19:10Z,I have Win 7 64bit but WinRAR 32bit. Not sure why that would make a difference.
