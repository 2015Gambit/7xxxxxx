,WaterHazard12,2012-07-04T18:45Z,sorry guys it still doesn't work (even with latest patchs) i tested on the Black Box version and the normal version...
,T.F.K,2012-07-05T01:01Z,You do everything step by step?Try copy-paste in your game directory
,Piratawu,2012-07-05T14:00Z,"Can't get to work it either, you save starts from last map but everything is locked."
,Piratawu,2012-07-05T14:02Z,"Can anyone verify if this even woks? Like everything unlocked and all mission available. Off-topic, how you edit posts in tpb, you can't?"
,WaterHazard12,2012-07-06T17:12Z,"Yes i did step by step...

and why putting in the game directory would work?"
,WaterHazard12,2012-07-06T17:21Z,"Yes i did everything step by step and still doesn't work

btw how does copy-paste the files into the game directory could work?"
,BociekPL,2012-07-12T13:41Z,is only last mission :(
,jlb1969,2012-07-16T20:52Z,"This save game does work! 
Thank you very much.  You need however to do the following: Only the location of the achievement files has changed, thus they can be restored.Go to;%USERPROFILE%My DocumentsUbisoftTom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future SoldierprofilesSkidrowand move data2, data1 and data0 to%USERPROFILE%My DocumentsUbisoftTom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future SoldierprofilesSkidrow{random number}  Now I need a favour from someone. I need the English files as mine are corrupt. Who vcan help me?"
,AnonymousBasterd,2012-07-23T12:50Z,"Not working for 1.3, all my weapons have locked out after applying this saved game."
,CHAOS1972,2012-07-29T01:40Z,"Thanks!

Worked for me fine. 
I just needed to finish the last level and did not want to start from the beginning after a reinstall. "
,BociekPL,2012-08-29T12:38Z,Work but this is not 100% :(
,crazysha,2012-09-01T02:08Z,"can anybody put this into any other sites,i cant download it."
