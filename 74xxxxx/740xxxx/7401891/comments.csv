thus is interesting also.. I loved the comment about aliens and bush.. guy has a sense of humor

also the one on rockets was interesting but lost me when got into acient aliens and bible talk :)
but it all was a great story.. now someone
in hollywood should watch this.. as lots of good ideas for a great scifi movie as most of the scifis
lately are too girly and lame full of plot or tech errors or axed
as if aliens cant find humans using night vision and infra -red scanning :)"
