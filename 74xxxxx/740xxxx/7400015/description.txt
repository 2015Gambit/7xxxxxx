Legend knows him as an archer of unwavering    
focus, the soldier who fought a battle in      
his own heart before taking up arms against    
his enemy. This is the untold story of Arjun,  
hero of the Mahabharata. A precocious talent   
plunged from boyhood and innocence into a      
murky world of deceit and betrayal, coming of  
age to become the most powerful warrior of his 
time. From the dusty plains of Hastinapur to   
the icy peaks of the Himalayas, Arjun: The     
Warrior Prince is the story of a man           
discovering what it takes to be a hero.
