The files inside do not belong to me, I just mashed up a bunch of files from other Project Zomboid torrents till I finally got it right since it either Black Screened me, closes for no reason or gets stuck in loading. Also I'm not sure if this'll work for some people but in case it doesn't, Here are some information you might want.

Java 7 (86x) located in C:Program Files (x86)Javajre7binjava.exe
Windows 7 64-Bit

Once you've extracted all the files inside the zip file into a folder, Run ProjectZomboid Experimental Optimized, It should be a batch file and then you're done. If that doesn't work, I included some more batch files in there, Try them all.

Have fun!

Once again, These files do not belong to me, I just mashed them together since everyone kept getting problems.
