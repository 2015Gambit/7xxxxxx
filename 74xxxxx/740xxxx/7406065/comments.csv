,iPlunder,2012-07-04T11:34Z,"Although these files play fine as is, there's a problem with the encoding. The app I've used to convert thousands of audio files, and normally has no problem transcoding AAC files, shoots me an error message when I try to transcode these: ""Cannot open the input file.

All my other lossless files are in FLAC format, but these can't be converted by XLD."
