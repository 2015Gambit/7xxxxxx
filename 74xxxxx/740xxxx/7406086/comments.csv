,ocky1,2012-07-03T12:56Z,"arsenal, was there a highlight show for the final? if there was, are you able to post it? thanks"
,arsenal_rocks,2012-07-03T14:53Z,"ocky1 : i think so but i think you should download the full match as it's the final and it's worth it :)
I will try but not sure."
,ocky1,2012-07-04T13:28Z,"ah, after i finished watching the full game at work, my girl told me that she wants to watch it with me, so i was just hoping that i wasnt gonna have to sit through the full game again, pretending that i havent seen it. if you dont have it, thats fine. you've already put in a lot of effort. thanks again~"
,arsenal_rocks,2012-07-04T20:08Z,"ocky1 @ it's the final so if you watch it 10 times the sensation should be the same.
And Highlights can be found in youtube also."
,StevenB69,2012-07-05T22:32Z,Arsenal How long is the trophy celebration in minutes?? Can you please specify. Does it have the part where the players' kids join in the celebration?? And does it also have pre match??
,arsenal_rocks,2012-07-06T09:26Z,"StevenB69 @ this is one single file.
I put all together. And the trophy celebraation is 9.24 min. Yes i think there is players kid.
No there is no pre match, only the pre match celebration."
,StevenB69,2012-07-06T20:18Z,Thanks Arsenal!
