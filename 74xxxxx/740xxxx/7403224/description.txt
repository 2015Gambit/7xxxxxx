CBC Massey Lectures 2004 - Ronald Wright - A Short History Of Progress

Format: VBR MP3
Length: 5 x 54 min

Description:

Each time history repeats itself, so it's said, the price goes up. The twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in human population, consumption, and technology, placing a colossal load on all natural systems, especially earth, air, and waterΓÇöthe very elements of life. The most urgent questions of the twenty-first century are: where will this growth lead? Can it be consolidated or sustained? And what kind of world is our present bequeathing to our future?

In A Short History of Progress, Ronald Wright argues that our modern predicament is as old as civilization, a 10,000-year experiment we have participated in but seldom controlled. Only by understanding the patterns of triumph and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age, can we recognize the experimentΓÇÖs inherent dangers, and, with luck and wisdom, shape its outcome.
