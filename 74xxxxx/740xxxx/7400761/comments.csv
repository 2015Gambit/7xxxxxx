The animation looks like something created on an Amiga 500, the story has neither head nor tail, and the actors ... Well, I'd better not comment them at all.

This movie is so bad that it is torture for your eyes and your mind.Save yourself the torture and use your time and money on something more sensible. 

This movie is undoubtedly one of the worst ever created, and does not even deserve one star.."
,irfan214,2012-07-07T08:02Z,"This is a truly terrible movie. The only reason I watched it was so that I could give a complete and honest review here and warn people not to waste their time.

The sound is terrible as they leave a noise in the background throughout the entire movie. I assume this is a simulation of the noise that the aliens are suppose to be making. Of course, with this noise in the background it is near impossible to make out the script... but don't be troubled because the script that I heard was as bad as the movie stars acting in the film.

The acting was about the only thing worse than the movie itself. There was really no story line, so, in the actors defense, this probably is the best they could ever do with a movie this bad. We are all safe though as I am almost positive that you will never see any of them in anything else worth watching.

Alas, the fickle world of Hollywood.

Unfortunately, this picture will probably sell tickets based upon its name, but it is nothing like Battle:Los Angeles and it is almost as bad as Battle for Los Angeles. With all the crap coming out of Hollywood these days, this movie is at the bottom of the pack.

Watch it at your own risk because you HAVE been warned!"

Absolutely rotten acting. The lead actress has a very severe case of rising inflections.

The directing is awful. Film quality is pre-1960 - everything is either green or brown.

The 'special effects' are laughable. Blood stains from gunshots to someone's torso aren't on the torso but visibly inches in front. The blood splatters all have the same spray pattern. A five year old with PhotoShop could have done better.

The highlight of the entire movie was a two second scene of a blank screen and complete silence."
