Synopsis
Everyone knows someone like Miriam Knight (Stockard Channing, THE WEST WING). Dumpy, unpopular, and picked on by everyone, she wants nothing more than to blend into the woodwork and be left alone. One day, Miriam hits an all-time low when, after a campus meathead breaks her heart, she drives away in tears and suffers a terrible car accident. As a result, she must undergo extensive plastic surgery. Emerging from her bandages a now-beautiful woman, Miriam determines to extract revenge on those who have wronged her, and begins killing them off in comically creative ways. Eventually, Detective Ralph Varone (Edward Asner, ELF, JFK) picks up her trail, but he too finds himself falling prey to Miriam's charms. This dark comedy was penned by Joan Rivers (ANOTHER WORLD).
