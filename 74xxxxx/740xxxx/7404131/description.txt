    The "comming attractions" trailer from the end of the 2003 Mother Productions DVD version of Pregnant Girls #19 usually omitted from torrents. This is actually the preview to a Pregnant Girls #20 that was never made. Mother Productions closed shop and sold the franchise to Starr Productions who released their own PG#20 with a different cast entirely. So, here you will see footage of pornstar Rocket solo from a scene that never did get released, and Krista Leigh in another couple scenes that never made it out into the full light of day.
