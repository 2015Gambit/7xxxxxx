,FSallATP-2,2012-08-01T14:02Z,"instructions for JV, FS

 regarding JV/FS installation please note:
 assuming your operating system is M$ Windoze 32bit..
 a. no need to format/re-format HDD ! (as I read elsewhere...) just uninstall the Jepp products.
 b. use REGEDIT (from START>RUN etc.) to go to registry and [u]delete all JEPPESEN entries.[/u] (uninstall does leave traces...)
 c. set computer date/time to 05 Jan 2009
 d. install JV and/or FS normally ( codes in this forum and TPB ) 
 e. use cycle 25/2008 0r 01/2009 for navdata update
 f. run JV and activate via phone ( site code R00D-KCAB will work ! )
 g. run FS and activate via phone ( site code R00D-KCAB will work ! )
 h. set computer date/time back to TODAY's date
 i. install the more recent cycle...DONE ! 
 j. above for Jeppview 3.xx and Flitestar/Map v9.xx, for the newest ""Jeppview for Windoze"" check this forum for instructions (Jan-Feb posts).
