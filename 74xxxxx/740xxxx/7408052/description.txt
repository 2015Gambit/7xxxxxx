Greatest Hits (2009)




The Black Eyed Peas transcended hip-hop to become one of the most commercially successful pop groups of the 2000s. Their career began modestly, with a pair of albums inspired by the positive-minded likes of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. After adding Fergie, the group's pop instincts reached full flight. Ignited by the Top Ten hit 'Where Is the Love?' and the Grammy-winning party anthem 'Let's Get It Started,' the group scored three multi-platinum albums in 2003's Elephunk, 2005's Monkey Business, and 2009's The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies). While still connected to hip-hop, the group's sound turned toward dance-pop -- a savvy move that transformed them from a cult act into a mainstream phenomenon.
