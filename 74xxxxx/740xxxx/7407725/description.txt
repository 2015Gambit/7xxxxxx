QED 39 ΓÇô Light

The equilateral geometry of Light as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Light as a form of EM radiation is explained along with all of its mathematical properties of Super positioning, interference, reflection & refraction.

Wave functions, EM wave probabilities and EM wave super positioning are all clearly explained with Tetryonic geometries leading to the full explanation of PhysicsΓÇÖ greatest mystery: Wave-Particle duality and the interference patterns produced by the slit experiments for the first time since they became apparent to scientists.

The thirty-ninth chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
