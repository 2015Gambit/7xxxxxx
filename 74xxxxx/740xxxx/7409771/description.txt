James Maxwell stars as King Henry VII, founder of the Tudor dynasty, in this remarkable series, the prequel to the BBCΓÇÖs award-winning Tudor histories, The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R. When Henry, Earl of Richmond, ascended to the throne as King Henry VII in 1485, he would not only unite England after the tumultuous War of the Roses, he would herald the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Modern Era. His reign would set the stage for the Protestant Reformation and the cultural revolution brought about by the Renaissance. Although overshadowed in history by his larger-than-life son and his remarkable granddaughter, his achievements can stand proudly alongside anything accomplished by his descendants.
