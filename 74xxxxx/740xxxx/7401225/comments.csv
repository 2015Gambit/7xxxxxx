I'll put it in my download queue, and when it downloads, I'll seed for as long as i can."

,Warbuxx,2012-07-02T01:46Z,Game.exe will not run. Crashes to desktop after a 1 second long black screen. XP.
,slowburn420,2012-07-02T03:44Z,Warbuxx is right I get the same problem on win 7 64bit
,ahameden,2012-07-03T13:16Z,"right click , properties ,compatibilty, then disable visual themes & desktop composition, worked for me in win 7"
,devtech,2012-07-04T05:39Z,This game crashes in a x64 OS. Patches and even the graphic check downloaded from their site crashes the same way.
,arn420,2012-07-07T22:06Z,"If you have a crash saying ""Access Violation ""....install OpenAL. Run (as admin on win7
) oalinst.exe in game install folder. But it still crashing when loading screen appears after I choose new game in menu."
,magnu1969,2012-07-09T21:17Z,game.exe is infected with a virus!!
,RickyTheFish,2012-07-14T23:51Z,"@magnu1969: This is a FALSE POSITIVE. The game installs and runs just fine, even on x64, and is completely virus-free.

For anyone having trouble, just make sure to install OpenAL when prompted. I refused the first time since I wasn't told what it was for, and the game crashed about 1 second after launching. After redoing the installation and accepting the OpenAL installer, the game runs just fine at 95FPS without any compatibility options."
,VBCoder,2012-07-31T16:19Z,"I confirm, this torrent holds a virus. Kapersky deals well with keygen and cracks unlike other antivirus programs screaming for all cracks. I think the game is repacked and therefore it is not trusted."
