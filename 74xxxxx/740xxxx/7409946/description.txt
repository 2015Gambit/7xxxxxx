Description

The fun with the little sisters carry on in the new Ore no Imouto game.
This installment picks up directly after the ending of the first game.
There are more little sister characters. Girls who play secondary roles
in the first game will be promoted to the heroine list, so there are
more stories, more events and even more chaos.

Conduct discussions about life with Kirino in midnight, go on a date
with Kuroneko, see what   s behind Saori   s glasses and see what tricks
Ayase and Kana have up their sleeves. You can go to butler cafes with
Sena and meet the absolutely adorable little sisters of Kuroneko's.

But everything is going to become even more complicated now that these
little sister figures have a chance of becoming your girlfriend.
