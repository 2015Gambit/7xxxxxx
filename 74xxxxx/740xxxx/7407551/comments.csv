[V],psspss,2012-07-03T06:51Z,"i suspect you werent seeing all the trackers.. most wull be from demon and exocdus trackers

also you find more if use utorrent and have bandwidth manager enabled however since it uses udp
you canr enable it with Ip hiders as it leaks real ip
sadly"
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T11:31Z,100s downloaded and no thanks. geeh.. why do I bother :)
,Fritz.,2012-07-03T12:58Z,"thanks for the upload...

...but as to the question why do you bother, i have often asked myself why any of the uploaders bother with it.

you are not getting paid and if you ever got any legal trouble over it none of these people will ever help you. they would most likely laugh at you and say things like its your own fault and so on.

i honestly cant fathom why the uploaders ever bother.

the people running the pirate bay are obviously getting paid for the advertisements, so there is some amount of profit in it for them, not to mention at this point im sure they could easily sell the website for millions.

the independent uploaders though... you are taking all the risk for zero reward, and noone is going to care if you get caught."
[V],psspss,2012-07-04T07:28Z,"i upped  the episode and xvid version as pple requested but then I find many leeching or not sharing
even before its seeded out

anyhow today isp phone said they want to cut my data and charge me more..
so its going to limit what I can upload in future now 

true perhaps the torrent sites need to pay their main uploaders :) but then you have too much money trail for the nasteys to get you

we do this from our hearts or to keep a subject alive like UFO and other stuff you dont get on news or is subpressed is the main reason but other shows are extras and pure entertainment"
