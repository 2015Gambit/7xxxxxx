,Ninjajp,2012-07-06T22:18Z,cant someone just run it thru a subber so everyone can watch this? why put a hindi based torrent for people who speak english in an english speaking country? just dumb. 
,Blitz5462,2012-07-07T10:09Z,@Ninjajp Internet is provided only to english speaking population. So if u dont understand hindi get off this torrent. 
,cazgrl,2012-07-08T11:42Z,"im actually really grateful for this! because i of course saw it at the theater first/like any sane person would for an epic movie like this instead of just being an ass and mooching everything and anything off the web and then posting troll comments and troll negative-ratings...and first of all; if you actually did care at all about seeing this movie and can spare about 10 bucks or half of that if you just go to a day time airing, it's REALLY nice to be able to go home and just kind of watch bits of pieces of this even though you can only speak English...i'm very thankful for this.
