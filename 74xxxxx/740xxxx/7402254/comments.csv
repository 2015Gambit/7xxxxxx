,Jerpsii,2012-07-02T14:13Z,"This may be a big overstatement, but this torrent is really suspicious. After starting the .exe my pc has just freezed by functionality and the torrent installs ""BangBangRacing.exe"" into the folder of The Walking Dead. Running up my scans now. Will post results later."
,Jerpsii,2012-07-02T18:00Z,AV-scan was clean. Torrent works flawless. Thanks for upload!
,Seancpconn,2012-07-02T22:54Z,Gonna keep trying but I can't figure out how to carry over my ep1 saved game
,marko8,2012-07-03T10:05Z,thanks
,Seancpconn,2012-07-03T10:33Z,"@Rovlad, no that didn't work. The reloaded version of EP1 I had installed to a different directory. Even moving my save files to the new save directory didn't work, but I got it working by coping over the EP1 install with the EP2 install. Everything worked after that. Thanks though. "
,Raul28r,2012-07-04T06:19Z,"thanks for this release, i love this episode so much is full of suspense and unexpected stuff, way better than episode 1, also a lot more action ...sort of. I cant wait for the next episode, this one had me hooked  until i finished it, is like 2 hr of play time more or less "
,MrsHybrid,2012-07-06T00:22Z,Doesn't work. Keep installing BangBangRacing.exe in my computer. Fake!
,cburr,2012-07-06T21:40Z,Where is the crack file? I don't see one..
,cburr,2012-07-06T21:44Z,And where do I put it. ): This game isn't even starting up for me.
,Fuzzywuzzy196,2012-07-06T21:57Z,"Lol, people think it's fake. That's so cute."
,queeeennn,2012-07-08T21:26Z,can anyone please help me? i downloaded this but all i got was loads of winrar files what do i do? :(
,Andriusas,2012-07-09T10:30Z,When i play game at the beggining i give the all food then is error
,kuske93,2012-07-15T17:27Z,"not fake u noobs it has 2 episodes,i completed the first,and now im about to play second."
,SceneGuy1991,2012-07-17T00:58Z,"Works Perfectly.!!

100 Thumbs Up."
,phadeb,2012-07-22T09:32Z,"Actually it could be deceiving cause the exe is still WalkingDead101 but if you watch closely on the pack folder you can see that 102 files are now installed.

I think thats a cumulative game..."
,manitoloco,2012-07-26T07:54Z,It works if you had episode one save the SAVE file in documents/Telltale Games and uninstall episode one. then install this one and replace the save folder. THANKS ArkLum
,NickAlcapone,2012-07-30T22:26Z,thanks buddy
,NickAlcapone,2012-07-31T16:38Z,Can somebody help me????It doesnt work to me.i install the game and then the doesnt open....why????????????
,msapiens,2012-08-02T17:01Z,"FOR ALL OF YOU WHO ALREADY HAVE EPISODE 1 INSTALLED:

Unpack and install the episode 2 normally. It will install Episode 1 too. After that, just copy the folder ""WalkingDead102"" from the new installation and paste it into the ""Pack"" folder of your previous installation. So, you can discard the files of the new one. Hope it can help, worked for me."
,sxczebra,2012-08-15T12:45Z,"Someone please help?
I downloaded and then extracted all the files, then mounted the ISO... but when I go to the install directory and try to open the application file it has an error message, saying ""Application load error 6:0000065432""?"
,tofumunch,2012-08-18T17:39Z,thx a lot for sharing mate!
,unlockingdegree,2012-08-24T09:26Z,"@sxczebra
