This was a real find for me at Value Village of all places.
I picked it up not knowing her but, unlike most people, my collection was lacking a 10 inch from the 1930's in VG- condition, and at $1.99 really had nothing to lose.
It turns out this is the perfect addition to one of my favorite artists of all time, Blind Willie Johnson.
I wouldn't recommend it to Marilyn Manson fans, but if you like Blind Willie, this is for your X chromosome.
