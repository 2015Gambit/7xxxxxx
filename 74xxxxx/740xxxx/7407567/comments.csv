,Sups_Dead,2012-07-03T06:09Z,Thanx! I've been using TPB for a few months now and more than half the stuff I load is from you. I really do appreciate it.
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T06:56Z,"a few shows collect faker seeders or antip2p

hence why you should be blocking them with peer block and level 1 ips so they wont appear int he client

also vpn is wise.. should use both together
even if peer block dont hide ip it blocks the nobs

this has 16 fakers by looks.. its not seeded out yet
im only a one man band and limited upload speed"
[V],psspss,2012-07-03T08:56Z,"ok it has 60 real seeders now

leaving you to it while I seed otu the other new torrents"
