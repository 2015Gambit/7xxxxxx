another mixed bag of music.  this one contains dubstep, folk, electronica, jazz, alternative, industrial, synthpop, industrial rock, metal, hardcore, emo, grunge and more.  list of artists: earl hines, einst√ºrzende neubauten, fad gadget, frankie stubbs (track 3 is missing.  i don't know where it went), goldfrapp, i can make a mess like nobody's business, ini, isobel campbell & mark lanegan, jane's addiction, john k. samson, kenny burrell, lea luna, lento, machines of loving grace, mark lanegan, matt pryor, mesh, milt jackson sextet, modestep, ornette coleman, polar bear club, porno for pyros, r.e.m., recoil, screaming trees, sine here, sluggo, slum dogz, sonny moore, the early november, the stooges, trever keith and willis jackson.  some of these rips are mine, some are not.  all mp3s, most to all are very high quality.  all files have been run through mp3gain so that their volume is set by perceived loudness, not normalization.  normalization is absolutely horrible.  artwork is attached.  the genre tags are probably debatable, but there are a million sub-genres and i'm too lazy to nitpick.  they are basically tagged so that they are grouped together with songs that have similar traits and each genre can be played on random without any songs causing wtf moments.  all are in directories that you can plop into itunes or your linstening thingy of choice.

enjoy.
