[b]Moyers & Company, June 29 2012: Confronting the Contradictions of AmericaΓÇÖs Past[/b]

Bill opens this weekendΓÇÖs [i]Moyers & Company[/i] with a reminder that behind this Fourth of July holiday are human beings, like Thomas Jefferson, who were as flawed and conflicted as they were inspired, who espoused great humanistic ideals while behaving with reprehensible racial discrimination. That conflict ΓÇô between what we know and how we live ΓÇô is still a struggle in contemporary politics and society.

No stranger to the contradictions of history and their racial touchpoints is BillΓÇÖs studio guest Khalil Gibran Muhammad, head of the New York Public LibraryΓÇÖs Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and author of [i]The Condemnation of Blackness[/i]. Muhammad and Moyers discuss the importance of confronting the contradictions of AmericaΓÇÖs past to better understand present issues of race and equality.
