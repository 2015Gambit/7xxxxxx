Brazilian DJ Rafael Lelis' take on the major hit single
Oye! from Gloria Estefan's 1998 album gloria!.

Translated excerpts from Lelis' bio at his web site:

"I always understood that what I felt for music wasn't
normal, that I wasn't just another kid who liked music, but
it was only at the age of about 16, when we bought a PC for
our home, that I had in my hands the ideal tool to venture
in the world of music production.

At the beginning it was all just for fun. I carried on with
doing it for a while longer until I discovered, at the age
of 20, the side of house music that still fascinates me:
club or tribal house.

The powerful vocals plus the absurd talent of such
producers as Thunderpuss, Junior Vasquez, Victor Calderone
and others really made me disbelieve what I was listening.

From that moment I truly found myself. I knew what I
wanted. That was when I started learning more about the
club house genre and improving my musical knowledge. I've
always been computer-savvy, which also helped me a lot and
allowed me to begin all the work you know today."
