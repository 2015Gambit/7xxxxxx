The definite live recording from the Davies/Hodgson days of Supertramp; this is a fitting reminder of the powers of a band at the peak of their commercial success. This is reflected in the song selection, which is largely drawn from the band's two most popular albums, Crime of the Century and Breakfast in America.
Recorded in the wake of the global success of Breakfast in America, Paris is a competent but ultimately unnecessary live album that fails to live up to the standards of Supertramp's studio material.
