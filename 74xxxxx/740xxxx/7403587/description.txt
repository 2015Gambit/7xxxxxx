(from the liner notes):
The Stanley Brothers were already one of the top bluegrass 

bands in the country when they recorded these ten gospel 

songs in 1961. Acclaimed for their hard-driving aand 

authentic bluegrass sound, the Stanley Brothers had a 

special gift for gospel music and few bands did it better.
