,p1r4t3r.,2012-07-02T17:45Z,"Ok thanks for clearing that up, but is there anyway to go back to your old OS?  Out can you uninstall this?

 I do not understand Portuguese and this system won't let me connect to my wifi (I used my smartphone for this comment)."
,floridaotario,2012-07-02T22:34Z,"You have to install another version of windows ... you can find it here on pirate bay...

I'll try fixing/living with this computer until I get a new one

Oh well, thanks for the torrent and help floridaotario (I'm assuming you fixed the torrent or will fix it)"
