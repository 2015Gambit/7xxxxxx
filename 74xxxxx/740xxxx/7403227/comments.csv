If you don't know how to seed, then you ought not post torrents where millions of people might see them.

,BartmanLA,2012-07-05T05:22Z,Kind of pointless post as even though it has 2 seeds listed there aren't any and there's no way to download this! 
,LoveDemon,2012-07-08T13:27Z,"Definitely want to get this album.
@leoggs, just leave your torrent client active with this torrent loaded, and make sure you do not move/delete the album folder from original directory from which you made the torrent.
Just keep your torrent client upload the album to some of the peers. As soon as some peers get 100% of the album, then we will help in seeding. So atleast a few of us have to get 100% first.
Leave your client active and connected to net.
Hope the problem is solved ..."
