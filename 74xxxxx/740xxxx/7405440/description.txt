How to Write a Song is a crash songwriting course for writing great, catchy songs on guitar.

Don't believe that you need to already know how to play guitar well in order to learn how to write a song and become good at song writing! Anybody can do it... 

Songwriting is a SKILL just like any other! If you don't learn how to write a song NOW, then you'll be struggling LATER when you are finally good at playing guitar! 

This songwriting report will show you how to write a song, however this is ONLY a report on how to compose music for your songs, not lyrical songwriting.
