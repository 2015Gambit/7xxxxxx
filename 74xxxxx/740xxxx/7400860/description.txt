PLOT:
This tragedy is about a man caught at the crosshairs where British colonial rule stifled Indian freedoms, told from the Indian point of view. Francis Massey (Raghuvir Yadav) works as a secretary for a British government officer in central India. The time is the end of the 1920s and a long way from independence. Francis tries to out-British his superior in every way. He dresses British and even marries British, in the sense that he has a church wedding. He is not the most efficient or talented worker, and his boss, the Commissioner Charles Adam (Barry John), often intercedes on his behalf. Massey's ironic destiny, however, is quite beyond the Commissioner's intercession. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide
