A sequel of sorts to the 1985 original Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust sees the highly skilled 'D' take on another mission that involves hunting down the breed he despises so much. Written and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the man behind such fan favourites as Lensman and Ninja Scroll one thing was assured from the moment Bloodlust went into production, and that was a film that should easily match the quite average originals action sequences with any other benefits considered a bonus. Fortunately Kawajiri and his team at Madhouse Animation Studios delivered and in this reviewerΓÇÖs opinion, bettered the original.

Set in the distant future the world of Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust is not that of the sprawling metropolises seen in most anime but instead a desolate wasteland littered with remote villages where people live in constant fear due to the recent rise and superiority of the Vampire breed. Fortunately there are many bounty hunters who delight in ridding the world of these creatures (at a cost of course) and 'D' is one such individual. There is however something unusual about the dark brooding signature character, who we discover is a Dunpeal, a human/vampire crossbreed who benefits from many of the Vampires' strengths, but few of their weaknesses.
