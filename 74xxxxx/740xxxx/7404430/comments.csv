Here's a non-kiddie version of this game. Keep pirating this, this guy deserves no money for blatantly ripping his game off of Toady's."
,SleazyUnicorn,2012-07-02T22:34Z,the only reason people are playing it is cuz its simpler then DF and the slight increase and graphics it appeals to some i agree its a ripoff and he doesnt deserve money thats y i screwed him outa 10 codes and i pirate it
,cowshit,2012-07-04T16:53Z,"Well this game is arcade version of DF, Who the money really belongs to is Bay12. But never the less the torrent works perfect. I did have a false positive, but that shouldn't be nothing to worry."

I haven't noticed new version. Nor indieDB nor desura does not inform me about this. Uploading new version anyway :)"
