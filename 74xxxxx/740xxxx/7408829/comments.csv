[T],nobody2007,2012-07-05T17:13Z,"v3.9.8 is available released in May, 2012"
,macomaniac,2012-07-06T06:36Z,"In case someone is fed up staying stuck at 0,0 % download, you can download MacX DVD Ripper Pro 3.9.8 at this address : http://www.filecluster.com/downloads/MacX-DVD-Ripper-Pro.html

Then, the following serial did work for me yesterday : BD-O7UEA5U-TZDVRUE

I hope it will do the same for you. If not, go give a glance at this page from TPB : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6090247/MacX_DVD_Ripper_Pro_v3.0_[Mac]-[CyberPiraten]. A series of serials were given for the version 3.0. Perhaps one or the other are susceptible to work still. Good luck."
