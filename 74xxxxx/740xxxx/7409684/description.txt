About the game:

Resident Evil 6 will allow players to select between three scenarios with connected storylines. The player characters from each scenario will have their own partners in a similar fashion to previous games. The game will have two primary enemies including the returning zombies and the newly introduced J'avo. Unlike zombies, J'avo are able to interact with each other to plan an attack, use weapons, and heal themselves. Also the game will allow players to be able to move around while shooting, an element largely absent from the previous games.
