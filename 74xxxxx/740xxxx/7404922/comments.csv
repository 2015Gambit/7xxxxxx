[T],scuba-doo,2012-07-03T18:59Z,"@EXOCEPTION malwarebytes report 4 False Positives when crazyXP is installed, due do some registry tweaks i made (1 tweaks was to make old style control panel...it reports that as some hijack registry entry or what ever :P...forgot the rest) ... they are not malicious...but can be easily removed if you don't believe me.

just a heads up :) .... enjoy"
