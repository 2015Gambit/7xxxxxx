,sherwinx666,2012-07-03T16:25Z,"@pulkit147
really? from yify??? then.. you must be ahead of yify's upload.... coz i don't think yify has this movie yet..."
,pulkit157,2012-07-03T19:24Z,please think and check before you start typing random shit... http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7398077/American_Reunion_(2012)_UNRATED_1080p_x264-_1.5GB_-_YIFY_
,sherwinx666,2012-07-04T04:43Z,"@pulkit157

is there a ""pie"" in that link? or in any labels or descriptions? im only reading it as ""American Reunion (2012) UNRATED 1080p x264- 1.5GB - YIFY"".. and not ""American Pie - Reunion"" now... who needs to think and check first before typing random shit?"
,xPorteR_,2012-07-04T21:08Z,WHY REUPLOAD? FUCKTARD..
,jordan2412,2012-07-04T23:40Z,"@sherwinx666

Yify does have an upload, i'm getting it right now thanks to pulkit. American Reunion is the name on the movie. Search American Reunion instead of American Pie Reunion and you will see Yify's upload...

I can't verify for his copy, because I didn't download it.."
,pulkit157,2012-07-05T15:28Z,"it's a strange world we live in...instead of thanking you for an upload people call you a fucktard...

@sherwinx666- I admit that I made a mistake in writing the title, but i'm sure you agree that a mistake like this one can be easily made by a person uploading his first torrent.

@xPorteR_- just wanted to do a little good, unlike you who instead of saying thank you very much goes from torrent to torrent swearing at uploaders.

@jordan2412- i appreciate your kind words and I can assure you that this is 100% legitimate."
,xPorteR_,2012-07-05T17:19Z,"pulkit157; The dvd and b-ray was released 05/07-12. You suck reuploading torrent that's already uploaded.  

You are not doing any good at all. "
,pulkit157,2012-07-05T20:58Z,@xPorteR_ just out of curiosity did u actually download the torrent?
,damouse1,2012-07-06T02:10Z,"I appreciate the idea of low sized alternatives, but the weakness of TPB search engine makes it annoying to get all these low quality releases poping up all the time. We could use a special YIFI movies section. ;P"
,xPorteR_,2012-07-06T16:15Z,"pulkit157-no, i can wait for the dvdrip /b-ray rip"
,pulkit157,2012-07-09T18:48Z,"@xPorteR_ this is blu ray quality. it's a solid upload from my side, i hope you actually download this because there's nothing wrong with it. you can read what the people who have downloaded it have to say about it in the ratings section in utorrent. (you don't even have to download the movie, just magnet it and read what people have to say.)
Hope this clarifies any doubts. Cheers."

Good job!"
