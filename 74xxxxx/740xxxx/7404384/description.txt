MxPx is a pop punk band from Bremerton, Washington with connections to the Christian punk scene. All the members of the band are Christians, and this is reflected in some of the band's songs. However, they prefer not to be called a Christian band. On the topic of their faith, Mike Herrera has been quoted saying "We are Christian. ItΓÇÖs not a cult or something. ItΓÇÖs part of our story and I guess itΓÇÖs different and controversial. But itΓÇÖs a personal thing. ItΓÇÖs what we choose to believe. ThatΓÇÖs all there is to it. We donΓÇÖt preach to anyone."
