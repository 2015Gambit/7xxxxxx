In the medieval and Tudor world there was no question in people's minds about the order of God's creation - men ruled and women didn't. Yet despite everything that stood in their way, a handful of women did attempt to rule medieval and Tudor England. Historian Dr Helen Castor explores seven queens who challenged male power, the fierce reactions they provoked and whether the term 'she wolves' was deserved. Helen looks at what happened when England was faced not just with inadequate kings, but no kings at all.
