ITV Tour De France 2012 Stage 2 Highlights PDTV x264 AAC

Presented by Gary Imlach, Chris Boardman and Ned Boulting. Commentary: Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen. Highlights of Stage 2, Vise to Tournai. Only one categorised climb today, but the roads south of Brussels are rarely flat. Even so, this one should be for the sprinters, so expect the World Champion Mark Cavendish to spring out of the pack in the final 200 metres.
