QED 40 - The Coupling Constants

The equilateral geometry behind the Universal Coupling Constants as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Using Tetryonic geometry to explain Lorentz corrections, Charge, permanent magnets and electromotive forces the quantum electrodynamic properties of EM mass-ENERGY ΓÇôMatter previously explained with Special relativity can be corrected.

The source of Charge along with the application of SR to Matter is corrected with the clear concise distinction between EM mass & Matter; and the universal coupling constant (alpha) is revealed as a geometric property of Q[A]M that forms the geometry of all constants.

The last chapter in the QED release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
