Having had a dear friend who used this method after having tried AA, rehab numerous times, and everything else, let me tell you firsthand, the Sinclair Method works. The Cure for Addiction now means that one doesn't have to travel to Finland for treatment. One doesn't have to abandon life as they know it to endure 30 days of rehab or attend AA meetings; the Sinclair Method integrates into normal life and no one has to know you're on it if you choose to keep it private. The Sinclair Method gave my friend back his life, and all those love him, reason to proselytize it in any way possible.
