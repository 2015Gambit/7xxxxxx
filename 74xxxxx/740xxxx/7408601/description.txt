|Yes, it's what it sounds like. This is game of thrones censored. Well, it's not |completely censored, there's still plenty of cussing. Basically, all the sex and |nudity is gone. There were other small things removed too, but not much.

|
|Why would some one want this?
|
|-If they did not watch the series since they didn't want to watch borderline |pornography.
|-If they want to watch it with a friend who does not want to watch borderline |pornography.

|
|Don't worry, I removed them in a way that the story would still make sense if |there |was important dialogue. I did one of three things of the combination of |the three.
|
|-Removed a part completely, if it didn't add anything to the story.
|-Removed the image and replaced it with a freeze frame of the character talking |so |you can still hear the dialogue without the nudity.
|-Removed the part and replaced it with a black screen ans text to explain what |was |happening.(almost never did this.
|
|So, you can still get all the action without the "action".
|
|Enjoy!
