ReleaseNotes:

The Temptations Sing Smokey leans heavily on a great soul-music tradition: the
practice of Motown artists' covering each other's hits as album tracks. Not that the Temptations' versions of Smokey Robinson-penned Miracles and Mary Wells singles
qualify as filler. Hardly, as Eddie Kendricks's falsetto makes a convincing stand-in for Robinson's on remakes of "You've Really Got a Hold on Me" and "What's So Good About Good Bye." Many of these tracks also underscore the strong doo-wop roots at the core of the Temptations' style, none more so than "Baby, Baby I Need You," which barely bothers to update its '50s influences for mid-'60s ears. This minor gem comes complete with three hit singles in "My Girl," "The Way You Do the Things You Do," and "It's Growing." --Rickey Wright

We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
