Jason and Bethenny are back in NYC and very much back to the business at hand -- getting their apartment renovated and making sure they have a place to sleep. With Julie leaving, Bethenny wants Jason to come onboard, but every time she tries to push him to make a final decision, there always seems to be a reason not to. With the stress building day-by-day, Bethenny indulges in a little NYC R&R -- a night out with Jake and a yoga class with Nick that has her worried more than ever about his health.
