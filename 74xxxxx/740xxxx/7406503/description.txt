The Filmmakers
Among the strong creative team assembled for the film are Director Mike Slee and co-writer Abby Aron, who together conceived the idea of turning what was an episodic piece into a story about the lives of two insects: a butterfly and a praying mantis who are born in the same part of the rainforest. "By following the life cycle of a praying mantis and a butterfly, one predator and one prey, the film is structured to provide dramatic tension while being educational," notes Phil Streather.
Jonathan Barker, Executive Producer adds "We've brought together a team of visual masters led by Peter Parks, a macro/micro specialist from Image Quest 3-D in the UK, who has won two Oscars┬« for designing film equipment and who designed a brand new optical system for Bugs!. Parks worked in collaboration with Director of Photography Sean Phillips, widely considered the leading stereographer and 3D cinematographer in the industry."
