"DJ Khaled remains an absolutely ridiculous and indefensible rap-universe presence, but heΓÇÖs still better at rounding up A-listers to perform on songs together than, arguably, anybody else on earth. His latest is ΓÇ£I Wish You Would,ΓÇ¥ an anthemic stomp that features Rick Ross in triumphal boss-mode and Kanye West, returning to his 808s & Heartbreak/ΓÇ¥Put OnΓÇ¥ singing-through-AutoTune style."
