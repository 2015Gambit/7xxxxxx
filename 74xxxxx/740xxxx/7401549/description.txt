The End were a mathcore/metalcore band who hail from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. They have been repeatedly compared to bands like Dillinger Escape Plan and deathgrind group Discordance Axis, as well as Neurosis. Their third album, Elementary, was released on Relapse Records on February 6, 2007. The albumΓÇÖs sound is unlike previous albums, with sung vocals and pop song structure. This change in sound has pushed many to compare the band to similarly accessible metal acts such as Tool, In Flames and even Opeth.
