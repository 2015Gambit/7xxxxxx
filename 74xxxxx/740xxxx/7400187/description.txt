Hacked Key Files for Project Zomboid 0.2.0r RC2


Zomboid.exe just does everything automatically which is unnessessary (well its good for morons lol) its an auto extract exe made with winrar, run it, hit install, done (win 7 tested only).
OR
For smart peepuls just put the 2 files that are in the zomboid directory
in your user profile directory Zomboid save folder which is USUALLY
Win7: C:Users(YOURUSERNAMEHERE)Zomboid
WinXP: C:Documents and Settings(YOURUSERNAMEHERE)Zomboid

Game Issues
if you have troubleness aka it not running
#1 install java 7 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1637588.html)
#2 edit the included ProjectZomboidEdit.bat in notepad (right click the bat file hit edit) and change only whats in the first quotes (C:Program FilesJavajre7binjava.exe) to correctly target your java 7 install directories java.exe, save changes and close notepad, then put the ProjectZomboidEdit.bat in your zomboid folder where their shitty ProjectZomboid.bat is and run the edited one.
#3 if game continues to not work beat head on keyboard and complain on their forums.
