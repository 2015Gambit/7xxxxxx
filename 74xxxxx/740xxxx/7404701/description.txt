Happy 145th Birthday, Canada!

Ripped with IMGBurn at low speed.
You can either:
1. Load the .cue into burning software and burn the image to a blank CD. You will then have an exact 1:1 copy of the original.
2. Load the .cue into ripping software, create individual songs in any format you like.
Remember, Google is your friend!

Enjoy!
