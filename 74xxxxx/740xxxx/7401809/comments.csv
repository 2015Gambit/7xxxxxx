[T],tr108,2012-07-02T20:53Z,"you're welcome guys.

@lilsean23 - sorry, no A Thousand Words. I will probably do Lockout - i'm a sucker for dumb action/sci-fi movies - but little else that's just released. (I'm trying to clear my backlog of older movies that I want to upgrade to 1080p)"
,lilsean23,2012-07-02T22:33Z,"Lockout is ok!!!!
Thanksss"
