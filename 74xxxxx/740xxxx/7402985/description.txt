another mixed bag of music.  this one contains dubstep, industrial, harsh ebm, ebm, hardcore, gothic rock and more.  list of artists: bassnectar, bauhaus, beats antique, chu ishikawa, combichrist, cookie monsta, covenant, dave navarro, die sektor, dj fresh, drumcorps, dubsidia, flux pavillion, your demise, 2nd communication, plus several compilations of various artists.  some of these rips are mine, some are not.  all mp3s, most to all are very high quality.  all files have been run through mp3gain so that their volume is set by perceived loudness, not normalization.  normalization is absolutely horrible.  artwork is attached.  the genre tags are probably debatable, but there are a million sub-genres and i'm too lazy to nitpick.  they are basically tagged so that they are grouped together with songs that have similar traits and each genre can be played on random without any songs causing wtf moments.  all are in directories that you can plop into itunes or your linstening thingy of choice.

enjoy.
