Episode 3 : The Entebbe Raid

The skill and audacity of Israel's special forces was first shown in a daring raid on a vital Egyptian air-defence radar installation on Green Island. Seven years later, in July 1976, the world was amazed as a special forces team flew more than 2000 miles to rescue 94 Israeli citizens and the crew of an Air France Airbus, who were being held hostage in Entebbe, Uganda, after a hijacking.
