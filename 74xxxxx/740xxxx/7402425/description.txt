Mass Effect 3 fan trailer - Sovereign vs. Humanity 

I'm a big fan of ME series and I'm waiting for the ME 3 release. I wanted to create this trailer to build the hype towards the final game of the trilogy. For me, although this is a great action game, Mass effect also is an exciting emotional journey. I just can't wait to see what happends to all the characters. This was one of the key points I wanted to show in the video.
