Here's a cool tune by the band Vibrolux "Can't Stop The Rock" used on the Mtv show 
Teen Wolf (season 2 ep.5) aired in July 2012.

It was originally released by the band in January 2011, but aired on the show in July 2012. 

I thought it sounded cool..(kinda like Dandy Warhols) so I looked it up.
It wasn't here- so I'm sharing! 

Peace!
