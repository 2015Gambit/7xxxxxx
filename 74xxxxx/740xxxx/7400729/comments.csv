,aarque,2012-07-01T19:48Z,"This file is not pirate material. You should post this where it belongs, regardless of it's efficacy. Likely it is already on some obscure support forum somewhere. I experiment with FSX a TON. When I damage it, I rename my scenery and sim object folders, run the FSX and Acceleration repair, delete the stock scenery and sim object folders, run my scenery mods like GEX and REX and fly. But that's just me.
