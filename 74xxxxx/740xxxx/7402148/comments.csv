The Aztec UFO Hoax was the work of Variety columnist Frank Scully who was hoaxed by two con men, Silas M. Newton and Leo A. Gebauer"
[V],psspss,2012-07-01T14:40Z,"was it a hoax though? its not actually proven is it?
stanton is on this docu normally he states the facts
that can be verified as best can

I havent listened to the c2c though and been a while since I watched this docu.. i think the docu talks about hoaxing and proving the story... as been a while since I watched the docu myself

didnt ufo hunters go looking for debri also to
debunk or proove it"
[V],psspss,2012-07-01T14:50Z,"its a interesting story and plausible though,,

a new radar tech using intense microwaves 
where a ufo accidentally flies into it and is crippled
and crashes

this is always the problem though.. where people
try to make heaps of money from selling videos
and books on UFOs.. makes it less credible each time.. instead of offering it freely and asking
for donations to support the cause

[V],psspss,2012-07-01T16:42Z,"Hoax or misinformation

new research.. so both these docu/chats cover

this subhect all very interesting regardless
