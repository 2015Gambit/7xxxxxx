QED 22 ΓÇô Electricity

The equilateral geometry of Electricity as derived from Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Electricity, its geometry and the source of its motive power is geometrised and its true relationship to electrical power is revealed

Electromotive force, Displacement current, Poynting fields and electromagnetic induction are explained along with the role of Bosons as electric exchange particles

The twenty-second chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
