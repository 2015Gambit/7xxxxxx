look here:  -->  https://thepiratebay.se/search/Game%20of%20Thrones*/0/5/208"
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-02T00:12Z,"Also, whenever someone finishes this download, and if they find there are some parts they think should be censored, or some parts I missed, I'd be happy to re-upload that episode with the edits you suggest."
,LotusLee,2012-07-02T07:43Z,"I for one really appreciate the effort. I will give it a shot and let you know how it went. I am getting terrible download times though with only 2 seeders. I guess everyone wants the boobs, and I can't blame them. These shows are awesome though, and I think they could still be as powerful without being so graphic on the sex scenes. Thanks again! You are awesome."
,47th_ronin,2012-07-02T09:55Z,"I think the word 'castrated' is the one more suitable, not 'censored'."
,Pulldown,2012-07-02T12:58Z,And all the killing. Horrible scenes what have you done with them? Is it OK for a family to see that?
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-02T14:47Z,"I didn't do anything with the violence. Honestly, I did this for personal use. I got hooked to the show, and wanted to watch it with friends and their is no way I'm watching sex scenes with them. I never appreciated them in the first place. I want to watch a series with lots of action, not a pornography. No reason for me to remove the violence, see? The series still 
makes sense if you remove the sex.
--------
Sorry, I should be the only one seeding for now, and my internet only allows 300kbs upload speed, so it will probably take a few days of continuous uploading for anyone to get this done. Thanks for holding out though, and hope you enjoy it."
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-02T14:54Z,"Also, just a warning, although I did get rid of some swearing, it wasn't really the focus, and there are still plenty instances of the F-word throughout the show. I basically just removed the nudity ans sex."
,mssacca04,2012-07-02T20:21Z,"This is great Flame_Leg. I really appreciate you taking the time to edit this and make it available to all of us. I love the show but don't want all of the nudity like some. Can I ask you what program you use to edit? I edit movies at times and when I export the file after editing, my file size is like 10 GB for a 1 hour tv show. I was wondering how you fit 2 seasons of Game of Thrones in HD into 26 GB? Thanks again for the upload!"
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-02T20:54Z,"I use adobe premiere pro, and export them as mp4's. Actually, I originally downloaded them in 720p as mkvs(each were a lil more than a gig), but premiere doesn't support mkv, so I converted them to mp4 with handbrake. The converted files were a little less than a gig each and after cutting things out and re encoding they were around 800-900mb each.
-------------
Also, I just realized I made a huge mistake. I accidentally encoded episode 8 from season 2 as an avi, and it is 11 gigs on it's own... Also, the quality is really bad. This should have been 15 gigs not 26. This is my first time uploading a torrent, is it possible to edit the contents? If not I'll reupload that episode..."
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-02T21:26Z,"Okay, I don't think there's a way to to edit the contents. When I finish encoding season 2 episode 8 again, I'll upload it, and also upload a new torrent with both seasons so people don't have to download 26 gigs again. 
------------
If your just starting this torrent, stop downloading it, and wait for me to post a link to the new one, it will be much smaller."
,mssacca04,2012-07-02T21:37Z,"Awesome, thanks for responding. I have never uploaded a torrent here before so I don't know if there is a way to edit the contents. I'm sure someone else will respond that knows something about it. Thanks again Flame_Leg!"
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-03T12:41Z,"Alright here is a link to the fixed episode 8:

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7408612

and the link to the new torrent with the fixed episode, only 16GB this time.

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7408601

Enjoy!"
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-03T13:47Z,"Sorry, use this torrent for both seasons.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7408740

Soon, I'm going to stop seeding this torrent, and start seeding the other, since it is only 16gb, not 26, and I don't really have the upload speed to support 2 torrents by myself. Barely enough for one. Sorry if this inconveniences anyone. It would probably be better if you just switched to the new torrent if your not extremely close to finishing it now."
,mssacca04,2012-07-03T22:21Z,"Flame_Leg I hope you don't mind me asking you a few more questions about your process of editing. I want to edit a few movies for my parents and I am impressed with the quality of your videos but I can't get mine to match in quality. I downloaded the trial version of Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. When it first opens it asks for a certain preset (AVCHD, Widescreen etc.) do you have a certain format that you like? Then after editing the video, you mentioned that you export in mp4. I am fairly new to Adobe Premiere and so all of the different options on the export screen are overwhelming. I tried exporting to mp4 but I only got an audio file. I've tried exporting in a few different formats but every time the file is very large (5GB) for a 1 hour clip. I was hoping you could explain the entire process of exporting and keeping the file under 1GB. Do you use handbrake after exporting to shrink the file? Thank you in advance for any help!"
,Flame_Leg,2012-07-03T23:51Z,"I used handbrake before editing to get it to mp4, since premiere doesn't support mkv. When you export the video choose H.264, then it should retain the original quality as an mp4. It should be in the preset Android Tablet. You shouldn't have to change anything after selecting H.264 as the format. Hope that helps!"
,mssacca04,2012-07-04T04:07Z,That is exactly what I wanted to know. Worked great. Thanks again!
,neocrosby,2012-07-14T18:25Z,"borderline pornography?  really? I take it you've never actually seen real pornography before.  Wow, its just a naked body, some people are huge prudes."
