Yep, you read it right. This is Game of Thrones censored. What does this mean?


-All of the nudity has been removed, some extreme swearing removed, and some other small things.

Don't worry, it has been done in a way that that will preserve the story. If a sex scene had anything important to the story in the dialogue, the dialogue was preserved without the nudity.

Why would someone want this?

-You don't want to watch a show with borderline pornography.
-You've seen it, but want to watch it with family, or a friend who would disapprove of the nudity and sex.

Enjoy!
