,xpacific,2012-07-03T18:39Z,Same problem here i cannot download the game data does anyone have a solution?? 
,ajmason63,2012-07-04T11:18Z,don't mean to sound dumb but don't you get the option of carrier network next to WiFi I downloaded this and got that option and it worked.but I guess mines a Sony live and not every phone is the same.
,meraj666,2012-07-05T22:09Z,No solutions yet... M dying to play this game.... If anybody has a solution or finds one then plzzz tell me.
,cisco1983,2012-07-05T22:40Z,what is the point of posting this up if its not the whole game? someone needs to post all the data that way we can just copy and paste in proper folders
,KillaKhronic,2012-07-07T22:09Z,"I had to find my freaking pirate bay password just so I could rage on Cisco and others. I'm so fucking tired of hearing that. If you don't like it, take it up with Game loft. It's the way they've been doing it since Asphalt 1. Not the uploaders problem. On another torrent I've seen ""Why is this torrent file so big?"" Well its because the apps are big. And If you want them zipped up, I don't really give a damn. If your talking about extra DLC, I would imagine that's a bit more difficult to get ahold of. But I swear to god I shouldn't even have to say any of this Its like these people are 2! And perhaps they are. I saw someones comment ""ive been playing gameloft games since i was a little kid"" That scares me. It really really does. I'd also like to thank BONE for once. Thanks man. I may not have several hundred android apps without you "
,Dannation,2012-07-08T11:32Z,"I'm getting the same issue, it's telling me it needs to download required files, doesn't work on the carrier network or wi-fi. :("
,frndfrvr,2012-07-08T21:52Z,"Even I'm getting the same message : cannot download due to network problem, even though my wifi is switched on on my mobile"
,anime1frk,2012-07-19T08:00Z,plzzz upload sd card files for galaxy s2 because i m unable to download via wifi 
,rakib.BD,2012-07-23T17:04Z,Same prob .BONE.
,ethan5432,2012-07-25T06:57Z,The ones who downloaded it earlier were lucky :/ We're getting the error because gameloft took it off android market for some reason. The only way to play it now is either wait till next week or someone uploads the files.
,dummy_office,2012-08-10T12:35Z,Hey BONE. I am in trouble. I started the game with wifi on and it gave me error: Cannot download gamedata. do you want to retry. I pressed YES but it keeps giving me same error. even though my wifi is working perfectly. Plzzzzzzzzzz help me.
,rkn123,2012-08-17T13:18Z,"He bone, I love your work man but in this game it is showing me error and automatically the game shuts down whenever I try to open it. Can you please upload some of x plane 9 planes for android ???"
,ymcmoney,2012-08-20T22:04Z,Why does this app need to uses services that might cost me money? The original app doesn't even request this permission.
,tspin89,2012-08-29T05:27Z,"Can everyone pull their head out of their ass?
The game is not available anymore on android market, so the DOWNLOAD WILL NOT WORK.

Might as well remove the torrent"
,Benishdamenish,2012-09-09T07:33Z,"@tspin89, thats not true. Its on the market as of 09/09/2012. Dont make shit dude!"
