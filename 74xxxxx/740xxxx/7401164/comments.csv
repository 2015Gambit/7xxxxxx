[V],psspss,2012-07-02T09:34Z,"anyone with a interest.. over 1300 download this episode so far 

its entertaining if anything.. i think it gets better
roswell one they find something.

we lack current shows on UFOs.. so anything is better then nothing.

plus as usual people dont give a shit about your opinions here :)"
,cinemaniac905,2012-07-02T15:17Z,"this is not entertaining...far fucking from it...this was the most unentertaining crap ive ever had the unpleasure of viewing. 

this is worse than nothing. detracts heavily from the subject while offering absolutely nothing of value.

if you dont agree with me you are a fucking idiot...straight up. 

worst show ever."
,cinemaniac905,2012-07-02T15:19Z,if you get off on spreading retarded and fraudulent bullshit...dont be surprised when people call it and you out.
,carrigart140,2012-07-14T19:28Z,many thanks for your hard work
