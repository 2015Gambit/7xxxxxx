,CainUAC23,2012-07-04T22:17Z,"last i checked VLC media player plays everything, and runs on ANYTHING, so how is it not compatible with anything????

furthermore, if you don't know how to play a ripped movie, you shouldn't even be on TPB."

,dlarrym1111,2012-07-11T07:34Z,"@CainUAC23: I totally agree, VLC is a great media player and can be custom tailored to get the most from your Videos. Not to mention it is free and YES It DOES run on everything! (or at least I am not aware of an OS it will not run on )

I have NO IDEA what  is talking about. It runs on both UNIX an LINUX, MAC OS with PPC and the newer ones with INTEL CPU's, Windows, VISTA, EVERYTHING!!!

@fastaa :  Got to WIKIPEDIA, you should find some decent explinations of how to use BIT TORRENT files. It does require that you download another app to ""re-assemble"" your torrent back to a video format that it is listed as when you browse the video selection here at this site. 

NO ONE can take a downloaded torrent file and instantly place it in a media player like Quicktime and expect to be able to watch it.

An app like uTORRENT, or TRANSMISSION (both are free by the way. THEN run utorrent, place the torrent file into uTorrent and it will begin rebuilding the described video file from the many listed here. 
Again, try WIKIPEDIA, you will find a better explanation there.

Don't speak of thing you know not. You obviously don't understand how to use a torrent file, or you wouldn't have made that TOTALLY INCORRECT statement. Cheers all.

A-9 - V-9

great quality and an interesting movie."

,Asshole88,2012-09-15T06:44Z,hey jack ass mkvs r a waste of fuckin time the reason behind them is great quality and smaller size for resolution but yours sucks both ways   try avi or mp4 at least you can play them on something besides vlc which is a great player but some people want to watch on something besides their computer
