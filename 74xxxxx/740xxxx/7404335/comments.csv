Season 13 just got finished dubbing. If I made another torrent, this one would be left unseeded. Sorry, but I'll wait untill the seasons pile up and then upload everything at once."
,Cryptic19,2012-08-28T00:55Z,"I downloaded awhile back and it was fine until i hit season 5 and discovered that some of the episodes wouldn't play so I looked and found episodes in season 7 that wouldn't play and that seasons 8, 10, and 12 i couldn't play any episodes what so ever. It keeps telling me that they are ""Unsupported Format,"" which i know us not true because the videos are in formats which i have played many times before on that player. So are these vids corrupted or not encoded right or what, and if so is there a fix of some form? Its kind of annoying to download this and find that 3 of the seasons don't work and 2 others have episodes that don't work either."
,Cryptic19,2012-08-28T00:59Z,Great UL thx

Just checked, I found no problems playing any of the episodes. I'm using VLC media player 2.0.2 on Windows 7 and I strongly advise you to update the media player your using if havent done so already. You might also want to check the size of the episodes that you cant play-sometimes there might be an error downloading a file and it just skips leaving it unfinished, though it doesnt happen as often as in your case."
,Cryptic19,2012-08-31T22:50Z,"Thx for the response Spetitais its fixed. I just downloaded the VLC player and it works now, i was using divx and it was obviously having issues so now i'm using VLC. Thx again :)"
