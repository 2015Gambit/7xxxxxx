QED 37 - The Photoelectric effect

The equilateral geometry determining the Photoelectric effect as derived by Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Building on the quantisation of energy by Max Planck and further work on the Photo-electric effect by Albert Einstein, Tetryonics provides a concise geometric model of the quantum mechanics behind the Photo-electric effect.

With a complete model of electrons, KEM fields, spectral lines and the quantum mechanics underlying them Tetryonics can now provide the geometric foundation for the explanation of wave-particle duality.

The thirty-seventh chapter in the release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quantum Electro Dynamics and electrical energy in the new millennia.
