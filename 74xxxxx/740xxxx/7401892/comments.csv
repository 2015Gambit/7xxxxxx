,josh1960,2012-07-01T21:37Z,"Brian Lumley is, quite simply, the best horror and fantasy writer alive.  He stands head and shoulders above, or perhaps on the shoulders of, H. P. Lovecraft.  I've already killed (read to death) two complete copies of this series.  Perhaps I can save a few trees now ;-)."
