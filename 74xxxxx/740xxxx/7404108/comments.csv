In RAR file download.
Sorry dude Shitty file, get better at this before posting and making available. Download other."
,osterac,2012-07-02T20:12Z,"I appreciate the speed at which this torrent was delivered, but what is the x264 TV standard you go on about? Video files have built in compression, and when I extracted the files I noticed the archives are actually 10MB larger than the video files themselves. Not only that, I think putting video files in archives discourages seeding. People don't want two copies of their video, one of which they can't use. The're just going to delete the RAR files to save space. RAR-ing video is just a pointless extra step that takes up needless time of both the uploader and the downloader."
