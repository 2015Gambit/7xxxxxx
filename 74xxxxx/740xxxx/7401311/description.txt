Under siege at night, Mitch's family runs out the back door. Two weeks earlier, Mitch takes the case of a condemned murderer, scheduled to die in Virginia, who wants to offer his heart to the teen daughter of the man he murdered; the girl needs a transplant to survive beyond a short time. Tammy and Abby visit the relatives of the individuals whose Noble Insurance case numbers Moxon provided: the pattern is not what they expect. Tammy gets an unexpected phone call that sounds like good news but imperils her relationship with Ray. Ray meets with Sarah Holt's ex-husband, who leaves Ray her military file.
