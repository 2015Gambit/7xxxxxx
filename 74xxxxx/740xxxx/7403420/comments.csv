,hiszpan2004,2012-07-01T22:53Z,key the win 7 enterprise working fine thanks guy good lock!!!
,mobileITservices,2012-07-02T01:24Z,No problem! I want to keep everyone enjoying the latest and greatest. When Windows 8 Enterprise comes out I will also provide those keys as well
,xpmule,2012-07-02T06:02Z,"if it was possible for MS to block this i would say bad idea. but i believe what you said and that ALL parteners get the same key ? the well done and good job :)
i would hate to think you would lose your own key because you share it etc..

I use Ultimate though so i don't think this is of any use to me. I use windows loader AND a hosts file patch"
,mobileITservices,2012-07-03T00:04Z,"Ultimate and Enterpise are the same version, with the same software features. The only difference is the licensing model, with one being Retail and one being MAK. My advice: Upgrade to Enterprise and be able to use the license on as many machines as you want with no hacks or Windows Loaders."
,tustard,2012-07-04T01:06Z,"Not sure what I'm doing wrong. When I use the Enterprise MAK key, I am prompted that it is incorrect. "
,xpmule,2012-07-04T08:56Z,"i'm familiar with windows keys
i think the most impressive crack i've seen
is the source code to the windows xp keygen.. blew me away how the guy reversed the PID/SKU system and the algo using eleptical curves n shit lol
I bet MS was suprised and pissed off way back when that happened lol

anyway i have doubts that all partners get the same key as you claimed.. Is this true ? Just like Win XP x64 uses the same key ?
If not your sticking your neck out and that key can and will be tied back to you and that technet sub shown in the pdf.
There is no way they don't log the keys given out and today they announced that because of piracy they are cutting customers keys in half roughly.. google it for more info

Don't take offence to what i say..
It takes a pretty cool guy to go and get those keys and share them so
thank you "
,mobileITservices,2012-07-04T20:27Z,"In response to what was said RE: the product key allotments for technet subscribers: I read an article here http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-slashes-product-key-allowances-for-technet-subscribers/4644 
that discussed the issues. What I would like everyone to understand is that the keys given to Microsoft Partners and the keys given in Technet are two completely different animals. As a Partner, we are given access to MSFT Internal-Use licensing that have no activation limits. The reason for this is that these keys are a part of the program benefits granted to us, but also that MSFT expects us to sell such software to clients and institutions. This is a tit-for-tat type of arrangement and therefore we are given a fair amount of latitude. One example is with virtualization or installation on our own internal computers. This would amount to an enormous number of activations and with these keys, thats OK. On the other hand, the Technet keys are really just meant as preview keys for enthusiasts who want to try the software on a test basis. The problem was, that because the keys are MAK keys people were abusing them and continuing to use the products without bothering to get a full license. A fair amount of the blame goes to MSFT for not limiting the number of MAK activations for each key, but also others who are choosing to pass those keys out and sell them for profit. 

this is going to sound hypocritical coming from me, the person giving out keys, but these people had no business bypassing the licenses granted to them and trying to make a profit. In my case, the licenses are unlimited and reimaging rights are inherent in my licensing model. This is the basis for me being ""allowed"" to pass the keys to others. As far as MSFT is concerned, I am activating on my own internal computers or that of my clients. No harm, no foul.

And as far as the XP crack, I would agree that is a pretty slick hack, and i think exactly what MSFT figured people wouldnt be able to do. "
,tghost414,2012-07-05T21:24Z,I must be doing something wrong when the Enterprise key is typed in I get an error that states wrong key as well. Am I missing something???
,mobileITservices,2012-07-06T02:13Z,"I looked at my file again and realized that I mis-typed the verifications. The best workaround I have found is just to zoom in to the PDF and use the product key in the screenshots. Also, be careful when entering anything that looks like a ""B"" or ""8"" as in the font MSFT uses they look the same."
,KalleKocko,2012-07-09T14:11Z,"I suppose the keys will work with any copy of Win 7 Pro or Enterprise ?
Downloading updates from from Windows servers would also work, right?
Thank you in advance!"
,xslntx,2012-07-15T07:21Z,"Enterprise key is done. Activated one PC successfully about a week ago, tried again and it failed. Didn't bother with the Pro key, may still work. Thanks a lot for the keys, though. Much appreciated!"
,Kokolisso,2012-07-21T20:14Z,"Professional Key failed just now:(
