,Lockrendan,2012-06-30T16:23Z,"Seeding.

,ZyLogic,2012-06-30T16:35Z,Is there a way to just install episode 2?

,Lockrendan,2012-06-30T16:41Z,...
,henre,2012-06-30T16:52Z,"Installed, pressed to play episode 2 and ''WalkingDead101.exe has stopped working'' what to do now?"
,Shahar135,2012-06-30T17:32Z,"listen i had already installes episode 1 and finished him. how can i install episode 2? i mean, how it works? there will be 2 games on my desktop - ep. 1 & ep. 2?"
,Mehrdadmaskul,2012-06-30T17:32Z,"If nothing's converted, then what's repacked? and well, where to find the 2nd Ep only?"
,Mehrdadmaskul,2012-06-30T17:37Z,"Oh and BTW, I just checked my 1st Ep's .ISO file and the size is 469MB which is the same as this file named ""Setup-4.vansik"" in this torrent, so could someone just get the ""Setup-1.vansik"" one (which is ~350MB) and just mount it as an image to see if it installs the 2nd Ep only that way or not and tell us about it? I'm limited on Bandwidth and cant try it to see it fails!"

First download I've ever gotten from Hero that DOESN'T work. Installer gets stuck at 63.8%, just as ""lockrendan"" had mentioned. Please fix this.

NOTE: The download is fully ""downloaded"", Its when you try to use the walking dead installer that it hangs at 63.8%"
