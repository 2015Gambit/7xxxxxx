Thank-you Nastia for entertaining us for so many years with your World Class talent... and Thank-you Valeri for sharing your Princess with the world. I can only imagine what this world would be like if every parent nurtured their children like Valeri did. Nastia is very well spoken as we have seen on Network TV. She will do well with whatever Network she signs with. Thank-you Nastia once again. All your sacrifices and hard work for your sport and all the glory you have achieved will not be forgotten.
Love. Bart."

,Anjalena,2012-07-28T21:32Z,"Hi TvTeam. Thanks for posting this! I'm downloading it right now. I'm trying desperately to find someplace where I can watch the Olympics online for free, or if I can't watch it live, at least get the recordings of it. But I can't find them. My TV doesn't get reception so I can't watch it that way. =(  Do you know a good place where I can find recordings of the 2012 Olympics?

>>> The rest of this is about the TorrentDay site.  =)

Hey, I'm curious about your site, TorrentDay. (long message here, sorry. i don't think you can P.M. on TPB?) I'm always looking for good, reliable torrent sites. First, you said it's open for signups. That was earlier this month but it seems to already be closed. Do you plan to open up signups again at any point soon?

Secondly, how long has TorrentDay been around? I haven't heard of it before. It looks promising. I do love the banner/header art and Logo. Very nicely done! =)

Anyway, can you tell me about your site (it is YOUR site, right?)? How long has it been open and how diverse is it as far as what type of torrents you have?

I love ThePirateBay but it's always good to have a couple of other sites in case I can't find what I'm looking for on TPB. I have an account over at Demonoid which I've had for quite a few years now. 

Anyway, I was just curious about the site. Hope you don't mind me asking questions about it. I hadn't heard of it before. If it's not going to open up for signups again, I was thinking about donating the $12 for the VIP account, if I can get my hands on $12. I'm both disabled AND poor. What a combo, right? *laugh*

Sorry about that huge post. Didn't know how else to get info about it. =("
