DESCRIPTION:
"Teutonic Order" - a historically authentic tactical war-game, which harmoniously combines two game modes, so that the tasks assigned to the user, are not limited to participation in the battles. Playing on the strategic map - a journey through vibrant and holistic world in real time. Total freedom of action, dialogue with the residents, RPG-elements and system tasks - such are the features of this regime. Fighting on the tactical map - the player commands his troops in battles with enemy armies, manages large-scale sieges of towns and castles, using special assault guns and cars and sending soldiers to fight on the walls and fortifications, protecting their own possessions. The game reflects the key events in the history of the Teutonic Order in the XIII century - namely, the conquest of pagan Prussia. Over 25 battles in a united campaign scene. The player will play the role of the provincial commander of the Teutonic Knights and the Crusaders repeat the feats of arms, despite the small number of troops and fierce resistance to the Gentiles.
