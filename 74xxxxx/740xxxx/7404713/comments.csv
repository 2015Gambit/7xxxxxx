,Foxx01,2012-07-02T09:49Z,There's a lot of scenes in this that turn white and through out the show the lighting keeps changing. Other then that everything is good

Nobody cares that you're using NetZero and AOL dial-up to download, upgrade to DSL or Cable..

I swear these people could get a million dollars and complain about it being all hundreds..

WTF STFU"
,kingda74,2012-07-02T20:57Z,"@Foxx01 Get a video converter preferably Roxio and convert the file.  This process will make sure all media servers will play the file without error, in other words no more white screens."

,dennistremp,2012-07-15T15:10Z,How annoying is Tara? I thought her mom was annoying as hell but after Tara turns it's like she turned into a psycho bitch and she didn't talk for the longest time and just stared with her stupid face and bug eyes like a little freak. I wish she had died... or true died. Whatever.
