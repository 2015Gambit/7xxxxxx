Sheila Chandra (born 14 April 1965 in London) is an English singer of Indian descent.

'I ride the waves of each deathly breath / Waiting to be awoken and born by your calling.' So sings Sheila Chandra on Moonsung's 'Waiting,' effectively giving plain words to the actual experience of her remarkable genesis through both breath and sound. Quite simply, Chandra's evolution of making sounds that in turn make music has given her permanent reverberation in a temporal world. A career that began as a teen pop star fronting Monsoon in the early '80s has not only deepened and matured but also broken ground with her last three LPs. It is from these recordings that Moonsung is culled, with the addition of two new tracks. Whether locking into unaccompanied drone, melody based on Indian raga, or revisionist folk balladry, Chandra's mutable voice is an instrument like no other, channeling that which is nothing if not ancient past and prognostication at once.
