This is an x86Mac torrent.

Aditional Information:

This has been zipped with Mac OS X so it should unzip fine. 

The game may have to be run once or twice before it runs perfectly.
If you have any issues, go to the file in finder and right click: Show Package Contents. Then select and run ""Wineskin"".
Mess aroung with the ""Set Screen Options"".


PLEASE SEED!

I am only able to upload at about 30kB/s so the survival of this torrent depends on those who continue to seed at as fast a speed they can."
