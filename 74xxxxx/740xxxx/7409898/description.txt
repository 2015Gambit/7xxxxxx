Description

Conception: Ore no Kodomo o Unde Kure!! is an Adventure game, developed and
published by Spike Chunsoft Co. Ltd., which was released in Japan in 2012.

Itsuki is bad with people, and even worse with girls. But he is entrusted
with the missions to birth children with 12 maidens to save a dying world.
Granpania is under attack, it needs a hero and star children desperately.
So the King summons Itsuki and his childhood friend Mahiru to his world.
To return home, Itsuki needs to fight monsters and get along with the ladies.
The closer he is to the maidens prior to their union, the more power his
prospective children have.

To make matters even more complicated, Mahiro confesses to him that she is
pregnant, but doesn't know who the father is, or whether there is a father at
all. Is the child one of the Star Children? Or is he something else altogether?
