CMT has inked a development deal with actor and former WWE superstar Steve Austin, tapping him as host of a new 10-episode series REDNECK ISLAND, it was announced today by Jayson Dinsmore, EVP, Programming and Development, CMT. Produced by 51 Minds Entertainment, REDNECK ISLAND takes 12 red, white and blue-collared Americans out of the South - and far away from cold beer - dropping them in a tropical paradise where they will compete for $100,000. The redneck-style competition series will debut in June, paired with a second season of CMT's hit series MY BIG REDNECK VACATION. As part of his development deal, Austin will look to produce additional series for CMT with his production company, Broken Skull Ranch Productions. (Source: CMT)
