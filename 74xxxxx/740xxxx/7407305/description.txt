-XBT- Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of the Phantom Edit - Compressed

This is the second movie of the acclaimed "Phantom Edit". Basically the creator took the original Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones, and re-edited the whole thing making it much more like the older Star Wars movies and attempted to make a much better movie by re-editing the whole thing.

I only saw a huge 4+GB files for each of the movies here, so I went and grabbed the TS source files, and removed the Title Screen and Extras.
I compressed the files using DVD Shrink, at 42% quality of the original. However, 42% sounds like a lot but is practically unnoticeable. Really all it does it make the file faster to download and frees up your hard drive for other movies! =)
Lastly I turned the TS into a playable and burnable .ISO file.

Play with VLC Media Player (FREE) by opening VLC and dragging the ISO file straight into VLC and it will play the movie.
