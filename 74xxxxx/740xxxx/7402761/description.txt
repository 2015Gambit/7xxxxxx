Plot: British medical student Martin E. Blake (Orlando Bloom) transfers to a Southern California hospital to start his residency. Charming and handsome, Martin is in reality an arrogant individual who longs to wield power over others. After starting out badly with patients and on thin ice with his superiors, 18-year-old Diane Nixon (Riley Keough) comes in suffering from a kidney infection, which gives Martin a boost of self-esteem. However, when her health begins to improve, Martin fears losing her and begins tampering with her treatment to keep her next to him in the hospital. An orderly, Jimmy (Michael Pe√±a), discovers this and threatens to expose Martin unless Martin gives him a steady supply of drugs.
