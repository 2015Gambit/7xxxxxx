,FastForwarder,2012-07-02T15:50Z,mphsdave1 it's the same thing every update. Some newby clains to block this or that and the blacklisted serial worked. People smarter than me and the uploader already tested the serial and it failed. They also tested known blacklisted serials with a fresh os install and never allowed the internet on and the serials always failed.

,loadeddice,2012-07-02T18:46Z,"If you installed this, shit-can it before it allows your software to start calling home. I took it off immediately and put the previous version back on, which works. "
,pryingeyes,2012-07-02T19:54Z,"Just to be clear, the software doesn't ""call home."" The provided serial is already imbedded in the software, and the first time the app decides to try to ""call home"" it recognizes the bad serial and disables itself immediately. That distinction is important so that nobody continues to think that properly setting up LS to prevent it from checking its own serial will work.

If you've installed this new one and, a few hours later, watched it die, you can find tutorials on the web for completely removing it, and then you can install an older version. Simply running the ""uninstall"" process in the software is not enough. There are additional files in /library and ~/library that need to be removed. Uninstall first, so that those files are no longer active and thus can be trashed. (Remember that you can access ~/library by holding down the Option key while clicking the Go menu in the Finder.) Then empty the trash, reinstall, disconnect from the internet, serialize the old version of the app, and block the connections noted above. Only then can you safely reconnect to the net."

This is how I understand  after trying iDAQ on some relevant files but too lazy to dig deeper: LSD got 2 separately jobs, checking locally if the key is correct (key checker is in LSD, corresponding key generator is on their server) and killing the app. The kill function uses a timer which is reset when LS is started at boot (that's why LS works again after reboot), it kills LS if no key confirmation received from server at the end of the 3hour count. I did not try to see what happen after 72 hours, first time I heard about that."
,PeterHolbrook,2012-07-15T11:50Z,"Yes, I saw the key that has surfaced. Actually, I just announced it immediately before your message.

Once LS is deactivated after three hours for using a revoked key, you DON'T need to reboot. It goes on working for another three hours if you enter another revoked key (at least, a recent one).

In any case, I'll remember your method for future releases of LS. Extremely useful and reliable. Thanks."

,aldo45,2012-08-01T17:12Z,@alexpires - Nonsense mate. LS 3 is a devs preview and will work only until the end of Aug/start of Sept. You don't need a serial for it. It's free because it's not the completed version. Works on ML for those who need it. For the others having problems you need to use LS to BLOCK LS after registering the serial. Remove all previous versions>reboot>disconnect from the internet>install>use key>use LS to BLOCK LS>turn internet back on. Same process for nearly ALL apps.

Thank you Anonymust!"
,bullitt08,2012-08-04T18:41Z,"For those who are having problems with invalid serial #s., follow this fix:

1) uninstall your current Little Snitch using the uninstall feature in LS 2.5.3 installer.
2) After the re-boot, make sure these files are deleted. The uninstaller does not remove them all so  delete manually:

From the MacHD: 

/Library/Application Support/Objective Development/Little Snitch/

From the Home Folder:

/Library/Application Support/Little Snitch/

/Library/Preferences/at.obdev.LittleSnitchConfiguration.plist

/Library/Preferences/at.obdev.LittleSnitchNetworkMonitor.plist

/Library/Preferences/at.obdev.LittleSnitchInstaller.plist

 3) Install Little snitch 2.5.3

4) BEFORE you use the supplied serial number, you MUST do the next procedure or else LS will call home and download the list of Blacklisted serial #s and the game is over.

a) Open Little Snitch rules and create a new rule.
b) Select ""Deny Connections"".
c) Make sure ""All Applications"" is selected in the next line.
d) In the Server drop down menu select ""Hostname"".
e) On the next line enter ""obdev.at"" without the "" "".
f)  On the Port and Protocol lines it should say ""Any"".
g) Hit the ""OK"" button.

 5) Next,  create another rule and enter the following:

A) Select ""Deny connections""
B) On the next line, use the drop down menu and select ""Choose Application"".
C) Look for ""Little Snitch UIAgent"". It should be in /Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UIAgent.
D) The Server should be ""Any Server"". The Port and Protocol should say ""any"".
E) Hit the ""OK"" button.

Final Step:  enter the Serial # and enjoy!"
,enzo5900,2012-08-05T06:25Z,^^^ Is that not the standard cracked install instructions for LS that we should all have done before with any prior version? Looks like it. So... does that mean many here were using the serial wrong? =P
,bullitt08,2012-08-05T23:34Z,"@enzo5900

Yes, this should be the standard procedure anytime a new version of LS is installed.
It guarantees that LS cannot call home to download the blacklisted serial numbers. LS  does not know that the Serial is not kosher until it calls home to verify. As long as it cannot do this, the program runs just fine. "
,koplersky,2012-08-06T01:46Z,"@bullitt08
I tried to follow your instructions, but after I've used the uninstallation tool that comes with the software all of the folders you mentioned are already deleted. I then followed the rest of the instructions but my serial expired after the 3-hour period."
,bullitt08,2012-08-06T02:38Z,"@koplersky
That's because you did not look at the TWO library folders.

OSX creates TWO library folders, one is located in the root directory or your boot drive which is usually labeled MacHD. The other library folder is located on the user account or your home folder. 

If you can't see one of them, make sure that you set "" show hidden files "" On your file browser to see them. Take my word, you probably missed at least two of them. "
,Anonymust,2012-08-06T05:11Z,"@bullitt08 The uninstaller now removes most of those folders now. I think only the pref/ ones may still linger but honestly I think with this new edition once its uninstalled your fine, no more deleting ""hidden"" files. Also some of the 2.5.3 apps have been updated and hard coded with a blacklist of serials, so no matter what rules you setup or even leave your internet access off it will still display invalid after 3 hours. I guaranty that if someone downloads 2.5.3 from obdev and follows all of your steps and inputs the serial within this torrent it will catch it. You are misleading people. "
,RoleyBirk,2012-08-06T10:02Z,Concur with Anonymust - despite those instructions after 3 hrs the serial is invalid.
,bullitt08,2012-08-06T18:25Z,"@anonymust

You are correct that the uninstaller removes most of the files but NOT all. Maybe the problem here is that if you are using OSX Lion or Mountain Lion the library home folder is hidden by default and unlike in previous versions of OSX  there is no way of showing hidden files  by activating it from finder however, it can be done from Terminal, heres how:

You can force Finder to show hidden files by editing a Finder property through Terminal. Open Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities) and enter the following line:

    defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 1

To stop showing hidden files, enter:

    defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 0

Entering these lines into Terminal will not have any immediate effects. You will have to relaunch Finder for any change to apply. You can relaunch Finder by logging off. Alternatively, you can relaunch Finder through the ""Force Quit Applications"" window, which you can open with the keyboard shortcut Command+Option+Esc (known as Alt+Windows+Esc on Windows keyboards). 

you will then be able to see the other  ""library"" folder in your home folder. all hidden folders will have a more pale color to indicate that they are usually hidden.

at that point open it and look for the LS files that are eluding you as previously mentioned.

I apologize for not including this step in my previous instructions I had forgotten about this issue."
,Anonymust,2012-08-06T20:21Z,"@bullitt08 Thanks but I am aware how to show all files. The 2.5.3 uninstaller removes ALL FILES now except for 2 *.plist files in the preferences/ folder. And I am almost positive they do not effect future installs. I have been using LS for years now and before it was imperative to remove these left over files once receiving an invalid message, but I don't think they hold any sort of serial blacklist anymore. Although of course for good measure you should just delete those 2 remaining files anyway."

And I want to be clear that these serials fail because Obdev updates the apps with a blacklist of leaked serials, not because the app called home.

If you really think about it...it could only fail after 3 hours because the program wasn't really blocked properly...  If thousands of people are using the same serial....then it must be the procedure that differs in the failure

,Ben2537,2012-08-26T06:17Z,"Hi everyone. 

It's gotten to the point that Little Snitch is incredibly good at doing it's job. In fact, after the 3-4 hours I spent trying to get around the program's ability to phone home and spot blacklisted serials, I realized that this difficulty indicates how great of a program Little Snitch is.

When I stopped to consider the monetary value of how much *ahem* 'stuff' Little Snitch can block, 30 bucks didn't seem so expensive. It was so much easier for me to just pay the dough. It took 15 seconds to play along with the system and fork over the money via PayPal.

I probably could have run an errand for my grandmother and earned the money back in less time it took me to realize that I could not beat Little Snitch at its own game. 

And I felt a lot better never having to worry again about software updates to Little Snitch or having it suddenly bail on me (and lord knows what sorts of 'phoning home' could have happened without Little Snitch staying on top of things).

This isn't for everyone, and I respect ya'll for trying (god knows I did). But for me, just purchasing the damn thing was so much easier. 

Happy hunting :)"
