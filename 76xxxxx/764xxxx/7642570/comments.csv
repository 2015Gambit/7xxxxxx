And he dies!! Filmed *entirely* in the coffin. WOrst movie to come out in many years. The fact that it gets a decent rating on IMDb just shows how gullible and stupid most people are.

Sorry, i have never posted a spoiler before, but this movie was so bad it made me want to punch someone. I'm just glad i didn't pay to see it."
