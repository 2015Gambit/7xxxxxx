,Oddington,2012-09-17T11:08Z,"isnÂ´t 0,1 and 2 the same? 3 and 4  is just stupid. And 5, standard quality, is compared to what? Non standard quality? BR is better than DVD, DVD is better than cam, cam sux and is better than nothing, watcable or not... Just DL and be happy or DL and bitch, but let people make up their own mind  about quality and quit the strange and useless selfmade rating systems..."
