Lost Worlds: Volume 3 WWII 
LOST WORLDS journeys through time to relive some of the most crucial events in world history within the walls where they occurred. In each revealing episode, discover secrets of the past with a team of historical detectives using evidence from recent excavations, state-of-the-art scientific studies, and historical documents. History comes alive before your eyes


1)  Secret Cities of the A Bomb 
In 1939, a group of scientists--Albert Einstein among them--warned FDR of the possibility that Hitler's Germany might be close to producing an atomic bomb. Roosevelt issued an order--the U.S. had to do it first. It was the most costly and labor-intensive engineering program ever undertaken, but within three years they were well on their way to creating a hidden world of secret cities and classified nuclear facilities. Six decades later, Lost Worlds returns to the places where history was made, visiting three top-secret cities in isolated parts of Tennessee, New Mexico, and Washington State. Using classified material, eyewitness testimony, and cutting-edge graphic technology, we recreate the secret world of the Manhattan Project.
