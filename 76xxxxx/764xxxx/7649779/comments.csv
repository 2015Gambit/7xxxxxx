,nefariousP1G,2012-09-18T18:07Z,same question as the one above. (Mahoraba3's question)
,Darshe42,2012-09-18T18:07Z,My guess would be WillowGame

,Mahoraba3,2012-09-18T18:12Z,"Still can't see comments as they're posted, which is retarded but on the same note as retarded, I've realized that I too am retarded.

The file names show exactly where they need to go, per my retardedness I did not notice this."
,Mahoraba3,2012-09-18T18:13Z,"Also, I've had this running for 10 minutes and its not connecting to any seeds, seed please."
,Mahoraba3,2012-09-18T18:26Z,"This whole unable to see comment thing until you post a comment thing is beyond annoying.

I've had this downloading for 15 - 20 minutes now and Its not even at 0.1%, wait scratch that I JUST NOW watched it tick over to 0.1% after 20 minutes, it seems to be actually finally starting to download after I updated the tracker 19 times."

,taturner,2012-09-19T02:47Z,Please seed people. I have been downloading for 5+ hours
,Mahoraba3,2012-09-19T04:35Z,"@taturner Make sure you right click the torrent and update the tracker every now and then, it won't detect new seeds unless you do.

As you can see, there's alot more seeds then leechers now, I was getting 200 Kpbs when there was 60 more leechers then seeders."
,BoxedUp,2012-09-19T08:13Z,"This Hit worked great for me. Just copy and paste the folder in the willowgame folder. This game is GREAT. They added just enough to make it better, but the gameplay is exactly like the fisrt. Almost like just an enhanced version of the first one. I ran it for about 2 hours on my asus laptop I7 2ghz GTX560m 2gb wide open no prob at 30 frames just with physx on high. Not bragging my shit is old LOL I'm just putting out that info incase anyone is worried about hardware like I was. This shit is crazy optimized for pc. No shitty port here! Enjoy guys. "

,BoxedUp,2012-09-19T08:25Z,"This wors 100%. Im about 2 hours in the game and it has been smooth as hell. 30+fps and im on one of those asus gaming lappy's with an I7 and a GTX560m. good enough but no where near a powerhouse and i run it pretty much maxed and by the way, physx on HIGH is a must. Fuckin TITS! "
,BoxedUp,2012-09-19T08:37Z,Sorry about the multiple posts with bad spelling......time to lay off the shit. but ya i'm happy :)
,preda96,2012-09-19T18:31Z,"Thanks man, working great with steam unlocked version.."

,da-rkside,2012-09-20T06:00Z,"Cannot get this to work with the game have been trying atleast 2 hours, can someone please help"
,JLYap,2012-09-20T23:14Z,"After countless hours of trying I found out that you shouldnt copy both the audio files and paste it on ""WillowGameCookedPCConsole"" instead you should copy English(US) file and paste it on ""WillowGameCookedPCConsole"", don't understand why it matters but it works"
