,hulivar,2012-09-18T03:10Z,"Hmm...I've definitely downloaded a 10,000 ebook thing before...I can't remember the file size though.  I do know that a 10,000 ebook upload exists though.  If you want to double check go to DC++ and search for it in the audiobook hubs.  I might just go do that...not sure yet lol."

At least this one has a txt file with the titles."
