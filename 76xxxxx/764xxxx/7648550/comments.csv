,PureHarm,2012-09-18T21:30Z,"i would like to recall my statement, this is the real deal. sorry for the hostility modman, every copy ive tried to see has been a fake or an attempt on my computers very life. i appreciate you, and cant wait to find your copy of this very important film on tpb."
,pySHtr,2012-09-19T01:14Z,thanks dude. can't wait to see the film!
,xboxmodman7369,2012-09-19T03:22Z,PureHarm I have run into the same problem trying to find a real version too. I saw it at the theater and can't wait to share it but for now this is everything I could find and is basically the same as the movie just in parts. Trust me I have been to hell and back trying to get a copy to upload. Thanks for recalling your statement dude. We need to all thank Dinesh D'Souza for such awesome work! If only we could get the Obama lovers to watch the film rather than chant Obama throughout the entire film maybe they would open their eyes to who this man is and how he is destroying the country we have worked so hard to defend! GOD BLESS AMERICA and all who have fought to make this country what it is!
,CG1969,2012-09-19T21:47Z,Many thanks for sharing!
,mickdundeeaussie,2012-09-19T23:12Z,Obama sucks! thaks for the great post. if the stupid son of a bitch is in power in 2016 we are screwed

I am in Israel & waiting impatiently for the movie. I know we would have a full house to watch it if it we could it here. The get out the vote movement is very strong & very anti-Mr Obama, so anything we can do to add to the upsurge of voters voting against him would be a great help. My email address is mamamitzvah@gmail.com. Please let me know when you get the movie. "

What do you have to say about Romney?  As Governor of Massachusetts, his crowning achievement was state health care, yet now that Obama has gotten national health care, Romney is doing all he can to distance himself from the state health care that he worked so hard to get.  Now, he is saying that the first thing he would do as President is repeal Obamacare.  Why?  You don't just do a 100% flip-flop on issues as big as health care.  "
,jojojojjo,2012-09-25T07:13Z,"Idiots who claim this movie a piece of propaganda are worst than ostrich sticking head in the sand. This Kenyan punk is turning America into third world country. You idiot need to wake up and act before you look like Kenyan and Pakistani running  behind a piece of bread like Egyptians  by 2016...........
If you can comprehend! This whole movie is based on the facts spoken by Obama family and friend in Kenya.
Wake up!!"
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T16:38Z,"""What do you have to say about Romney?""  He's a much lesser evil, period.

As the Republican governor of Massachusetts, he had an incredibly difficult job of trying to bring as much sanity as he could to that state government while having to compromise with the Dem-dominated legislature.  That's politics - we were forced into this irrational and corrupt game; we are just playing defense.  Romney performed very well as governor under those circumstances, and he has a great executive track record in business and non-profit / NGO management as well.

People who don't understand the difference between forced socialist health schemes in Massachusetts and forced socialist health schemes on the Federal level are not mentally fit to vote!

If you're in a state where your vote cannot possibly influence the outcome, vote Libertarian on principle instead.  If you're in a swing state, however - do anything that you can to send Obama to the ash-heap of history where he belongs!"
