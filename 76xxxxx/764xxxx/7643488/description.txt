The novel takes place in the 'North American Confederation' of 1992, wherein 
technology has advanced to the extent of permitting civilians to reach the 
Moon and psi phenomena are widely accepted as real. The protagonist is Joe 
Chip, a debt-ridden technician for Glen Runciter's "prudence organization", 
which employs people with the ability to block certain psychic powers (as in 
the case of an anti-telepath, who can prevent a telepath from reading a 
client's mind) to enforce privacy by request. Runciter runs the company with 
the assistance of his deceased wife Ella, who is kept in a state of "half-life", a 
form of cryonic suspension that gives the deceased person limited 
consciousness and communication ability.

When business magnate Stanton Mick hires RunciterΓÇÖs company to secure his 
lunar facilities from telepaths, Runciter assembles a dozen agents for this 
task. The group includes Pat Conley, a mysterious young woman who has an 
unprecedented parapsychological ability to undo events by changing the 
past. Joe Chip is shown at several points to have sexual feelings for the 
defiant Pat Conley, who once gives the impression of reciprocating them.

When Runciter, Chip, and the others reach MickΓÇÖs moon base, they discover 
that the assignment is a trap, presumably set by business rival Ray Hollis. A 
bomb explosion apparently kills Runciter without significantly harming the 
others. They rush back to Earth to place him in half-life.

Afterwards, the group begins to experience strange shifts in reality. 
Consumables, such as milk and cigarettes, begin to deteriorate prematurely. 
Also, the group sees Runciter's face on coins and receives strange messages 
from him in writing and on television. Most of these messages imply that 
Runciter is in fact alive, while the others are in half-life, or "cold-pac" as it is 
informally called. Group members who separate from the group are found 
dead, in a gruesome state of decomposition.

Note: Except for a modification of the file names, this is a verbatim repost of files
posted in this group in 2009. I finished listening to Ubik 2 weeks ago, and enjoyed it.
It's more cerebral from your standard airport novel.
