3)  Churchill's Secret Bunkers 
During WWII, a vast complex of secret bunkers was constructed under the streets of London. It was a vital refuge from the nightly onslaught of Nazi air raids, and only recently has its full extent been revealed. The existence of Churchill's Bunker is no secret, but the fact that there was an entire subterranean city built to keep the British government running is only now being revealed. Very little of this covert network, which also sheltered American General Dwight Eisenhower, has ever been revealed to the public. Now this lost world is brought back to life--the tunnels beneath the heart of London's great buildings; the underground command center from where the Battle of Britain was coordinated; the ultra-secure chambers that could withstand the most deadly weapons in the Nazi arsenal. Beneath the streets of London, Lost worlds expose wartime secrets we were never meant to know.
