I have been noticing a very big problem with the new u torrent ver 3 very bad speeds and acting funny,  so after checking everything i could i uninstalled my u torrent then i installed my original from a very long time ago because it was always promising and sure enough not only was it the problem so was tracker udp://tracker.istole.it:6969 and udp://tracker.ccc.de:80 i removed them and switched my utorrent to ver 1.77 and i have amazing speeds again,  however if there is a torrent download problem i have this one Ver 2.0.4 which is told to me as a few extra features and more stable,  im running it now and yes its great...no more issues with certain torrents either!
