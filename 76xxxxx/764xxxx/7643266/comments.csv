,ap2882,2012-09-17T21:37Z,There's plenty of others that are confirmed for XBOX. This is most definitely fake. Move on to a better seeded and confirmed torrent.

,Ripclaw187,2012-09-18T20:10Z,I don't know why you're having problems with audio. I extracted the folder and recopied to my harddrive and it's working fine. I will be uploading the testament of sherlock holmes after I test it and make sure it works. Everyone please seed.. 
,Ripclaw187,2012-09-18T20:23Z,I updated my utorrent last night and didn't notice it had removed my seeds. I apologize to all that have been stuck and it's up and running again.

,croftsco,2012-09-24T04:48Z,doesnt work at all for me. the file was not even named right. it was like filename.7z.filenumber wich doesnt work. then i fixed it and it couldnt extract. too much work either way. dont recomend

,Ripclaw187,2012-09-27T06:41Z,If having trouble with extraction try 7zip. That's what I used to make the files. I'll use winrar for now on.
