Storyline:


When a young drifter is drawn into the dark world of a psychopath, he soon learns that, sometimes, excitement can have deadly consequences. Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary, Drugstore Cowboy) and Andrew McCarthy (Mulholland Falls, St. Elmo's Fire) star in this taut suspense story packed with action, intrigue and powerful performance. An engrossing tale of small-time crime, Kansas is a big-time thriller you won't want to miss!

Slick scam artist Doyle Kennedy (Dillon) has yet another con on his mind as he helps down-on-his-luck wander Wade Corey (McCarthy) hop a speeding freight train. Kennedy's been looking for a partner in crime, and he's determined to take Corey along for the ride. But though Corey finds the danger and adventure intoxicating at first, he soon realizes he could be looking at some serious jail time - or worse - unless he finds a way out fast.
