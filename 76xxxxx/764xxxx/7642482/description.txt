Abraham-Hicks 

1998 - 2008  Transcripts of 107 + Workshops


The Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle 

called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions 

play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our 

experience. 


In 1985, Jerry and Esther Hicks began dialogs with Abraham. 

But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? Abraham is a name. 

A symbol. A feeling. Abraham is a Non-Physical entity ΓÇö whom 

Esther calls "infinite intelligence" and Jerry stated, "the purest 

form of love I've ever encountered."


Check out Abraham for yourself. It's the only way to go and the 

only way to know.
