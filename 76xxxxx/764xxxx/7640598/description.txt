The first Zombie Nation record contained the song "Kernkraft 400", German for "Nuclear Energy 400," which is considered one of the most famous songs of electronic dance music[citation needed]. The song is a remix of a tune from the 1984 Commodore 64 game Lazy Jones by David Whittaker called "Stardust". Soon after the first independent release in 1999, the song became an underground hit in European clubs, and was licensed to various countries including a more commercial remix version by Italian remix-producer DJ Gius.

The song, specifically the "Sport Chant Remix", is popular at North American sporting events for goals and other celebrations. It is believed that the first use was at Marquette University in 2002.
