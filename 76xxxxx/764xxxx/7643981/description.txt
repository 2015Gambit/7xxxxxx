QG 61 - Space-Time

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The equilateral geometry of Space-Time relating Zero Point and Vacuum energies to their interactive energy momenta and coupling constants.

The speed of light is established as the foundation for Cartesian and Riemannian co-ordinate systems.

The geometric relationships between Charge-Time and mass-ENERGY are revealed along with the pressure gradient created between Tetryonic nullspaces and the Vacuum energy Aether [Gravity]
 
The sixty-first chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
