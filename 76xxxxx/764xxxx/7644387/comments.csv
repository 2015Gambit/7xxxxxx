,piranical,2012-09-17T08:32Z,"thanks again HeroMaster for another awesome upload. you are one of the best pirates...@EliteBeast thanks for the breakdown. i know it feels like you need to do this to be able to faithfully and credibly give a points assessment of a movie torrent...my 2 cents? rating according to ur scale, I agree with ur assessment, but i'd be inclined to give the v a solid 8.5. it's that close to dvd quality imo. m, i'm not going to rate because 1, i haven't watched it yet and 2, i don't go there. just flicked through to rate quality."
