StatusBar+ is the FIRST custom status/ notification bar for Android, no root or custom ROM required!
It works in any orientation and appears consistently for ANY and ALL applications. In full screen applications it automatically hides and in some applications like ZPlayer it becomes transparent for seamless integration.

In order for StatusBar+ to handle third-party notifications it MUST be enabled in System Settings > Accessibility and NOT in the app itself1

StatusBar+ is more than just a custom status bar. It comes bundled with its own MIUI-style battery bar, the ability to change any and all indicators to any color your heart desires, features for users with AMOLED screens to avoid pixel burn-in, popup notifications, and much more.

Currently supported system indicators include Signal strength (GSM, EVDO, and CDMA. 4G HSPA+, WiMax, and LTE experimental), Data network type (ie. EDGE, 3G, 4G, etc.), WiFi signal strength & WiFi Access Point, Bluetooth, Language, GPS, Battery percentage & icon, Time (automatic 24-hour detection based on the system preference), and more coming soon.

Signal Strength:
Signal strength calculation may not work properly on your device. The Samsung Galaxy S II line and Sony Ericsson Arc running Gingerbread 2.3.X, for example, have a documented issue (see http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=16862). If you run into problems with signal strength please try our other application, Signal Strength Detector (see http://market.android.com/details?id=com.tombarrasso.android.signaldetector), available for free on the Android Market and submit your results. This will help us further improve calculation.

What's in this version : (Updated : Aug 27, 2012)

    Added the ability to hide in the homescreen/ launcher.
    Fixed a number of bugs with Accessibility, Jelly Bean, and more.

Required Android O/S : 2.1+
