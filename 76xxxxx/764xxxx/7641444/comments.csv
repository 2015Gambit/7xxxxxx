Besides the color, there's a fully annotated reader's guide which ""fills in the gaps"" and places in historical/literary context every scene from AoB.

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-16T19:10Z,"Hey, thanks for the info AoBColors. If I supported iTunes I'd be over there in a hot second for the annotated readers guide portion alone! (I don't, though, sorry. Nothing against purchasing books, I do that quite regularly. I'm just not an Apple supporter.) I'd definitely recommend those who do taking the time to plunk down four bucks in support of this great book. Any idea if there's a plan to eventually do up the collected versions in that format (preferably in print)?

Yep. I quite enjoy the b&w version. Love it, in fact. But I'm a big fan of the b&w comic book. Nothing against color, I like that, too. But b&w books are what I cut my comic book teeth on so I've always had a soft spot for a story told well with words, pencil and ink."
