,mrthiago14,2012-09-16T05:26Z,go to torrentday.com and get invited. if you dont no anyone on it than donate for 12$ as their accepting donations in return for an account. That website is built on seeding. and is carefully watched by the admins of this website so you or no one cannot leech. Im downloading borderlands right now with 1mb a second with 200 seeders and 50 leechers. I suggest paying a one off 12$ for unlimited games movies and shows. Which realistically isnt such a bad bargain if you ask me.

,bluegizmo83,2012-09-17T04:06Z,"Just an FYI guys, not sure if its a bad rip or what, but I've burnt this game twice now on my iHas324 iXtreme FW drive and then ran both discs through KProbe. Both discs burnt fine and seem to play fine (played for about 45 minutes), but KProbe readings are NOT within the recommended specs. I've burnt other XGD3 games with the same settings and from the same batch of discs and the KProbe results for them were within the recommended specs.

iHas324 Settings in ImgBurn:
Force HyperTuning = ENABLED
Online HyperTuning = ENABLED
OverSpeed = ENABLED
SmartBurn = ENABLED
Clear OPC History = Done before every burn

Blank Discs:
Verbatim MKM001 Singapore's
Burn Speed = 2.4x

Antivirus disabled, nothing running in the background and computer is untouched during the burning process and KProbe scanning process.

First Burnt Disc KProbe Results:

,Smallz94,2012-09-17T04:11Z,GUYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS YOU NEED IHAS BURNER TO PLAY THIS GAME. I USED THE TRUNCATE METHOD AND DIDNT WORK SO I RATHER BUY FROM MY FRIEND WHO SELLS BURNED GAMES. GET IHAS BURNER AND FLASH IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET THESE PROBLEMS OUT OF THE WAY.. :))) 
,tmgforever,2012-09-17T06:06Z,"GUYS, I FOUND THAT YOU DON'T REALLY NEED A IHAS BURNER IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS GAME. I USED TRUNCATE METHOD AND IT CAN STILL WORK:-

1. IF IT SAYS DISC UNREADABLE, INSTALL THE GAME INTO THE HARD DRIVE

2. WHEN YOU RUN THE GAME FROM THE HARD DRIVE, IT WILL SAY 'DISC CANNOT BE AUTHORIZED'. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET AN USB DISC, PUT A MP3 FILE INTO THE DISC, PLAY IT THROUGH THE XBOX, USING ITS OWN MUSIC PLAYER. 

3. THEN LAUNCH THE GAME. THE GAME WILL WORK WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION FAILURE. YOU CAN STOP THE MUSIC WITH, AFTER THE GAME HAS BEEN LAUNCHED USING THE XBOX BUTTON.

I AM PERFECTLY ENJOYING THIS GAME WITH THE TRUNCATION METHOD WITH LT2.0+. HOPE THIS METHOD HELPS!

,twohearts_left,2012-09-17T22:43Z,"@cc178700

ill start from the top. I have a flashed xbox. I use my laptop burner which IS NOT an ihas or anything special. I use memorex DVD- R(DL) to burn my games using imgburn. I truncated. 

step one: put any .mp3 song on one(1) flash drive (we'll call it flash drive A)

Step two: insert it into xbox

Step three: install game from disc onto HDD or separate flash drive (we'll call it flash drive B)

step four: go to xbox dashboard.

step five: play song from usb.

step six: start game WITH MUSIC PLAYING (it will stop momentarily when the game start just let it go)

step seven: play game WITH MUSIC PLAYING for around 5-10 minutes 

step eight: stop music and enjoy game. 

Yes you have to do this every time you start the game. or atleast until tuesday when the game becomes verified i assume. but it works. Let me know how it goes for you cc.



@Swiftwinter

because not everyone has a high end gaming pc or one capable of handling a game like this. didnt that ever cross your mind? "
,Tezert,2012-09-17T23:16Z,"@Swiftwinter
There are a few reasons why people downloading and burning x360 v. instead just simply download and crack pc version. They might have computer which is not good enough to launch this game on at least low details (laptops), on cracked pc version you can't play multiplayer, xbox 360 allows you to play multi on illegal version of game, or they can be just like me, im downloading pc games only if they has awesome graphic, crysis, skyrim, BF3 (i bought this one but i suppose that you understand what i mean)"
