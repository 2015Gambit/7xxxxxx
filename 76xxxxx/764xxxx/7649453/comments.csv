,Drapes12,2012-09-20T08:35Z,Setup works but cannot adjust game settings making it un playable due to resolution being horrible... maybe stay away folks
,mamadoudieng,2012-09-20T14:45Z,Does it works perfectly ?
,Yaminabo,2012-09-20T18:03Z,"Well it really works, but in my opinion is not even like the good pro evolution that we are used to.

This one only shows Ronald's face everywhere and you wont be able to change resolution or any graphic detail so, its like downloading a shit game and deleting it 5 minutes after."
