[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-18T08:34Z,"So, way back in the Summer of 1982, this was one of two comic books that grabbed a hold of my guts and grey matter, and with much joy and wonderment, permanently attached 'the bug' to the very core of my being. I've not stopped reading comic books in one form or another since that fateful Summer afternoon.

This book (Elfquest) in particular, I followed with near religious devotion until well into what is referred to as Elfquest Vol II (sometime around 1998 or 1999). With Wendy and Richard turning over so much of the work to other people who weren't up to what I considered their own very high standards I just couldn't be bothered anymore. I've since caught up and do in fact own a physical copy of every Elfquest comic (monthly) ever released.

After the realization that comic books were becoming available in a digital format some years back, I kept waiting for the Elfquest books to turn up, because in my mind, EVERYONE should have been reading Elfquest! Well, they weren't. As popular as the first three series were (and they were insanely popular), it seems that by the time the digital revolution got to comic books, most people had lost interest in Cutter and the Wolfriders. Further, once the books did start showing up it seemed, for a very long time, like the only thing that was available was the colored trade paperbacks. I gather from 'teh interwebs' that this is what a lot of people prefer. Well, not me buddy! All the magic is in the original issues, for me.

The years go by and I start seeing more and more of the latter series turning up at 'the usual spots'. Eventually it seemed like pretty much everything was out there, or would be very shortly, OTHER than the original 21 issue b&w, magazine sized issues published by Wendy and Richard. 

A few years ago - I don't know exactly when, three or four I guess - I decided I was going to bust out my issues and do my first scan. I did that. I scanned them all. Possibly at the wrong size and/or resolution, I'm still not sure. And certainly not in the easiest way to edit and finish them (nearly every page needed to be turned, leveled and cropped). It was so time consuming that I actually stopped for a while when I began to lose interest. During that time, my PC died a quick and sudden death! Thankfully, all the images were on an external drive (and backed up to boot!). Unfortunately, all the software I was familiar with from YEARS of use left my life with that PC. I started over again with another PC... that died last year.

Cut to last month - several years and two PCs later - and I finally decide to try uploading something to the Pirate Bay. It worked. It's fun. There seems to be a small core group of downloaders who dig the same stuff I dig. That and the fact that I have a whole suite of software that I'm happy and comfortable with again made it time to dig out the old raw Elfquest scans and finally finish that project.

So here it is, just finished this evening. Cover to cover scans of my personal copies of the original b&w magazine size Elfquest comic books published by WaRP Graphics. Over 1000 pages, all done to the same standards as all the books I've been 'Restoring'.

The best part is that as of today, when I do some searches at 'the usual places', it looks like these are finally available. Puckernuts! Oh well, I hope somebody enjoys these."

,starwolf1001,2012-09-18T19:35Z,one of the best series EVER!!!
,blattsucker,2012-09-18T20:09Z,"My undieing gratitude. I got more then 80% of your postings up to now. 
I have 2 questions/requests.
My real collection and digital of Cerebus is complete up till issue 300. But everything after that like companion, fanzines, Glamourpuss is missing.
Do you have these things and can you post them?
And he 2nd question is : do you plan a RESTORE of issue 1-300? Many of the scans were taken from reprints. About the same as my real collection that starts between 60 and 70 with first printings.

Many thanks in advance, and I will follow your posts as long as you make them.
Do you"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-18T20:42Z,"First of all, thanks everyone! I had fears that there would be no interest in this upload. It warms my old (well, middle-aged, I suppose), dry guts to know that even a few people still care.

Second, blattsucker, get out of my head! Yes, I'm already working on a 'Restore' of 1-300 (Cerebus was the other book I discovered in the Summer of 82). Although a lot of issues 1-25 will be the Cerebus Bi-Weekly releases (not a big deal in my opinion, since the creator of the book is starting the digital side with High Society anyway). I'm pretty sure I'll be 'Restoring' a lot of the same files you have, but it will still be all 300 issues, scanned cover to cover. All the Notes From The President, Editorials and Letter Columns. All 6000 (plus!) pages bright white and the same size. With the recent news that Dave may actually be stepping away from comics for good and his STILL rigidly stubborn thoughts concerning the idea of letting anybody else publish Cerebus (even a great company like Fantagraphics), I think it's time to get this done.

Also, Glamourpuss? Yeah, today! Spooky man, spooky.

,m0rdant,2012-09-18T22:21Z,I've got the other version that is out and yours is much cleaner - thanks for the hard work.  Hope to see more b&w comics you've restored.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-19T00:17Z,"Thanks for the kind words m0rdant, and you're very welcome. Good to hear that you can tell the difference between the two. That's what makes it worth the effort. In regards to the b&w stuff, a pretty vast majority of everything I've uploaded as 'Restored' is b&w (probably 2/3 of it). I just labeled this one as such to be make it clear from the jump that these were not the same colored versions that have been around at TPB for quite a while. You can be sure I'll be upping MANY more of them, though. Probably this afternoon, in fact."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-19T00:27Z,"Also, it's been so long since I did the original scanning that I forgot to mention there are added pages in these books.

When Epic reprinted these books in color for the first time they ran them at the normal page count, which stretched the series out to 32 issues instead of the original 20. As such, some of the cut points didn't make any sense, so Wendy and Richard had to write and illustrate new ones to fill in the holes. Then, at some point over the years, either in the back of one version or another of the collected series, or maybe through the Elfquest website, those new pages were made available in b&w, even though they were first seen in color (got all that?). I've inserted them into each of these original issues at the appropriate spot. Also included one short color story that belongs with the contents of the issue it's in. "
