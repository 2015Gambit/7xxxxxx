Stanley Ipkiss is a bank clerk that is an incredibly nice man. Unfortunately, he is too nice for his own good and is a pushover when it comes to confrontations. After one of the worst days of his life, he finds a mask that depicts Loki, the Norse night god of mischief. Now, when he puts it on, he becomes his inner, self: a cartoony romantic wild man. However, a small time crime boss, Dorian Tyrel, comes across this character dubbed &#x22;The Mask&#x22; by the media. After Ipkiss&#x27;s alter ego indirectly kills his friend in crime, Tyrel now wants this green-faced goon destroyed.
