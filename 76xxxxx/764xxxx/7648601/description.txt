Description

Graham GreeneΓÇÖs evocative analysis of the love of self, the love of another, and the love of God is an English classic that has been translated for the stage, the screen, and even the opera house. Academy Award-winning actor Colin Firth (The KingΓÇÖs Speech, A Single Man) turns in an authentic and stirring performance for this distinguished audio release.

The End of the Affair, set in London during and just after World War II, is the story of a flourishing love affair between Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles. After a violent episode at MauriceΓÇÖs apartment, Sarah suddenly and without explanation breaks off the affair. This very intimate story about what actually constitutes love is enhanced by Mr. FirthΓÇÖs narration, who said ΓÇ£this book struck me very, very particularly at the time when I read it and I thought my familiarity with it would give the journey a personal slant."
