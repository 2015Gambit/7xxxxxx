This torrent contains all Bryan Ferry solo stuff from 1974 to 1988. These are old unremastered versions of the albums for those of us who enjoy vintage and uncompressed CD sound. All these releases are no longer pressed so grab them now. 

Whimsically, I have also included his wonderful "Bete Noire" album from 1987.

FLAC format.


P.s. - Bob Ludwig sucks...
