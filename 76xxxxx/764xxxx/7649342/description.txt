Notes:

The last from 5 shows, performed in 1989 at Paris Bercy in France.
A part of European 'Another Lapse' tour, promoting 'A Momentary Lapse Of Reason' album.
Very good quality, material comes from CDR copy of very nice low generation tapes from Recorder 1.
Loud and enthusiastic crowd... but not extremely loud in general.
As usual in Francophonian countries Dave hosted the show in French.
Discs' division compatible with the course of the show. Very carefully indexed.

Audience recorder 1. From low generation tapes. Revised version (normalized, speed corrected,
reindexed).
