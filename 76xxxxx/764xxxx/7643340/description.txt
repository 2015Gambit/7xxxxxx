Wyrd Sisters [1997]
Code: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159931/
Based on the Terry Pratchett novel. On Discworld,
(a world carried on four elephants standing on a
huge turtle travelling in space), in a small country
called Lancre, three witches, the flowery Magrat
Garlick, the lively Nanny Ogg and their leader Granny
Weatherwax find themselves dragged into royal politics.
The king of Lancre, Verence, has been murdered by Duke
Felmet and he has taken over control of the country
(but he is trapped under the control of his over
powering wife - the Duchess.) However there are two
problems, firstly the Duke hates Lancre and the actual
kingdom of Lancre is pressing the witches to find a
king that would take better care of it. The second and
bigger problem is that Verence's baby son has escaped
and has fallen into the hands of the witches prompting
the Duke's fury towards the witches. The son must be
protected but Granny doesn't want to get involved with
the situation but it looks like she doesn't have a
choice in the matter...

Soul Music [1997]
Code: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159914/
This animated version of the bestselling novel by
parody master Terry Pratchett is a cautionary tale
about the dangers of Rock Music--which in the
Discworld is literally Music with Rocks In. A
restless harp-playing teenager from the countryside
is determined to become the Disc's greatest musician.
His prospects look dim, especially after he forms a
band with a rock-bashing troll and a horn-playing
dwarf. Until, that is, he stumbles upon a guitar with
a life of its own and renames himself Buddy. Meanwhile,
reeling from big-time job stress, Death takes a holiday,
leaving his teenage granddaughter to look after the
family business. Like girls all over the Disc, she falls
for Buddy, a problem since he's living fast and soon will
need her professional attention. But while the beat goes
on, no one (almost) is immune to its spell.
