,morriso4,2012-09-17T16:25Z,Anyone else stuck at 99.9%?
,Hatshepsut,2012-09-17T17:22Z,"Oh yes, morriso4: 
Stuck at 99,9 % and have been for hours :("
,jeansy2,2012-09-17T18:09Z,"Me, too. 99.9% for a couple of hours now."
,Hatshepsut,2012-09-17T19:40Z,"Yes. And my bittorent-client keeps telling me ""only 8 min left"" and then ""only 13 hours now"". There hasn't been any seeders since this morning. 
Why does scenetime do this? "
,CaptPeacock,2012-09-17T20:03Z,"Me also.  Stuck at 99.9%  Can't say for how long.  But, it's been too long?  Where's that last 92.8kB?  Aaaargh!"
,Praetorian909,2012-09-17T20:08Z,"Yup... 99.9 percent for HOURS!  But I just went ahead and watched it to made sure all was well.. and it was flawless.  But shame on scenebalance!

-1 for them"
,Hatshepsut,2012-09-17T20:32Z,"Agree. Shame on scenebalance. I can't watch it, I get the message that the file is broken."
,Karyobin,2012-09-17T21:32Z,"Working version here:

Downton.Abbey.S03E01.HDTV.XviD-KWS

Seriously, I just downloaded it (an hour or so). Enjoy."
,Praetorian909,2012-09-17T21:54Z,Cool... but there's no place to download that.. and its not on TPB
,Praetorian909,2012-09-17T22:06Z,"File does not exist, Kay..."
,Hatshepsut,2012-09-17T22:20Z,Don't buy it!  Karyobin is a fake and maybe something worse.
,Hatshepsut,2012-09-17T22:24Z,"""We care to share . Join us on  http://www.scenetime.com ""

I'll never be fooled again."
,Karyobin,2012-09-17T22:49Z,"True, it wasn't on TPB. I just re-did my search and it came from here a rapidgator link, but the earlier address was accurate. It was on the first page of Google so should be pretty easy to find."
,Karyobin,2012-09-17T22:50Z,"'something worse'?!

Goodness - what could be worse?"
,Praetorian909,2012-09-18T01:08Z,1. Kay.. you never gave an address just a file name and 2. All those links when you look on google want you to download toolbars and programs like that.. THATS how its worse!
,Praetorian909,2012-09-18T03:06Z,I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong... and I do.  Karyobin I finally found it on the rapidgator site.. Downloaded it and watched it.  Was perfect.  So I'm seeding it on TPB.  Thank you.
