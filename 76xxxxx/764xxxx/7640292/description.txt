Overview: Looking for a Home Screen for your Android Tablet? Introducing Chameleon. Chameleon replaces the standard Android Home Screens and App Launcher with one that isn't just more useful. But more beautiful as well. 

You can set up multiple Home Screens with your own layout of widgets and apps, giving you the most relevant information that you want, when you want it. So whenever you unlock your device, you are presented with the Home Screen that is immediately valuable to you. Chameleon Home Screens can be set up based on GPS locations, WiFi networks and time ranges, allowing you to define which Home Screen is the most relevant for the situation.
