Guy is buried alive, calls on his cell, they try to find him, and think they did just before his air runs out, except... they're at the wrong spot! And he suffocates!  Worst movie to come out in a long time. The fact that it gets a decent rating on IMDb just shows how undiscriminating (or desperate) most people are.

Sorry, i have never posted a spoiler before, but this movie was so bad it made me want to punch someone. I'm just glad i didn't pay to see it."
