Just in case some naughty person wants to harass you for downloading this, and probably because it might try and connect with Steam and stop you from playing your non-Steam copy. -=x

Thanks for the upload, Test...I tried another version and only got at most 25 kbs but with this one actually made it up to 2 mbs. -=)"
,shock9191,2012-09-19T06:45Z,"Hey guys, I just finished installing it, but even though I follow instructions, I can't get game to start...   B2Launcher works just fine, but when I click Play nothing will happen.

Usually everything works like a charm, but wow that game just won't start...

Any help appreciated,

Everyone read this article and comment on it telling the guy he's completely wrong. He compares Borderlands 2 with COD and Halo. WORST ARTICLE EVER. It's all over the internet and it's ruining the name of this game. This is such an awesome game. We can't have it ruined. Here's the link;

,IAMDANIEL,2012-09-19T10:54Z,"Okay. So this torrent totally WORKS.

follow the directions. and when its done installing, install ALL the pre-reqs. if that still doesnt work for you go download a different crack for it. and try that. i just played for over an hour and this is the one i downloaded. good game. worth 60 bucks."
,crdeath27,2012-09-19T14:50Z,"@shock9191, and anyone else having the issue with the game not launching:

I had the exact same issue.  You just need to install Steam - don't need to register or sign up for anything, just install it and the game will launch just fine."
,WW2BOY,2012-09-19T14:59Z,"Guys. THIS. WORKS.

I don't know what you are doing wrong, all you do is mount, install, and copy over the binaries folder to your install directory. THATS it.

I didn't even have to TOUCH B2launcher.exe.... the game is already in english. Also, it says to disable the game through your firewall, I didn't do that, I just turn my wifi off on my laptop when I want to play. Either way, EVERYTHING works FINE!"
,krdonnell,2012-09-19T16:36Z,"Thx SKIDROW, a day one release, top notch. This does work and is the premiere edition. Although I already had cracked steam working and Im running win 7 x64. But for those of you who cant get it to work. Just mount, install, copy crack from iso to directory in which you installed (binaries) (make sure you to add them and copy over the original when applicable, and be sure not to delete all the other files in the binaries that you are not making changes to. There should be 70 files and 14 folders in the binaries folder), copy both the b2launcher and the normal borderlands 2 app shortcut, and put them on the desktop. Use the b2launcher to adjust settings but not to actually launch the game. Use the other icon to do so. Make sure you installed steam, blocked borderlands 2 from the internet thru firewall (keeps the FBI away from your front door). Mark the borderlands 2 in your antivirus as trusted (as to ensure it doesn't delete files that you just added( this is because cracks can work it the same way a virus does, and tricks antivirus programs into thinking its a virus)). And pls make sure you install all the extras at the end of the bl2 install, be careful because for once there actually all unchecked (ie. directx, windows redistributed c++ 2005, etc., if you dont have these you will get errors.) Game should work, if not, reinstall and try again. As I said Im running win 7 x64 which from what I understand has the least problems. Thx SKIDROW, and Test_Verify for the upload. Thx gearbox for the awesome game, wish I had the money to actually buy it and support you guys, you deserve it for this masterpiece of a game. And last but not least....                    LONG LIVE TPB!!!!!!!!!!"
