This is a personal dump of my NTSC USA disc for anyone who may be interested in getting the NA version.   

There is NO fixed Eboot with this.  It is a straight rip from the retail disc.   Perhaps a group will release a fixed Eboot for the NA release.

Sorry, but I'm on a 1Mbps upstream connection.   It may be slow to get started but once there are some peers and other seeds active, it should be fine.
