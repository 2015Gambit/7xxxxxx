An abandoned Uruguay community rails against Hollywood's purchase of an antique locomotive in this comedy drama from sophomore director Diego Arsuaga. Despite the locals' joy over the sale of the train, the Friends of the Railroad Association views the purchase as the selling of an important part of the town's rich history. In a last-ditch effort to sabotage the sale and keep their beloved locomotive, the group hijacks the train and attempts a daring escape to Brazil. With the police in hot pursuit, the daring feat inspires new hope in a town who lost their connection with the outside world when the train stopped running years ago.
