Dubstep long player from True Tiger stalwart Sukh Knight. Split over two plates, you'll get six tracks taken from the dubstep rave skool of Rusko, Bar 9, Benga etc. meaning lots of dubby vibes, old junglist samples and raving arranegments made to excite the dance. The best cut on offer has to be 'Ganja Dub' featuring a cool Rodigan sample and a turbo charged rave synth. For fans of raving to dubstep.
