,SomeGuy1999,2012-09-18T10:18Z,"Don't take the comments personaly, course i guess u did since u or the admins removed the critical ones, we all appreciate the work all the uploaders(except fakers) do, but this show stands for everything that is rotten in E-industry!

The fact that a talentless bimbo and her family of equaly moronic bimbos gets prime time on air where so many talented people get their shows cancelled while this piece of garbage is into it's seventh season thanks to the moronic couch potatoes that are the audience is just tragic, and so is the fact that u as a ripper put work and effort into this crap where there is so much quality material that never gets any attention

Just my 5-cents!"

Deleting your comments were a subtle way of asking you to fuck off. I see you didn't get it.
So, if you want to keep your account, don't leave any more troll comments here or anywhere else."
