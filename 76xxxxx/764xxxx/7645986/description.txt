########Darksiders 2 PC - saves :

These saves are on level 11 to 14.
It is mostly just saves of important parts of the game.

The saves are : 
1 - Awaking the Guardian. (at the 2nd stone).
2 - The Guardian.
3 - The Tree of Life. (After beating the Guardian).
4 - The Crucible. (You can't beat it with a low level).
5 - Bheithir.
6 - After killing Bheithir.
7 - The Tree of Death.
8 - The Arena's Champion. (you'll have to collect the 3 stones to awake him).
9 - Story finished. (Note : This save isn't by me, it is from "FLeEviLe", so if the save doesn't work, don't blame me :P)

########Where to put the saves :

~Windows XP path for Darksiders 2 save game :

"C:Documents and Settings\My DocumentsMy GamesDarksiders2"

~Windows Vista/7 path for Darsksiders 2 save game :

"C:Users\DocumentsMy GamesDarksiders2"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And in the "Darksiders2" folder, you put the "English" folder of the save you want to play with.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Skidrow :
"C:Users\AppDataLocalSKIDROW50650Storage"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here you just put the two "dssaveX*.dsav" from the "Darksiders 2English" folder in the "SKIDROW50650" folder.
X* = number, example : 0 and 4, so your files would like "dssave0.dsav" and "dssave4.dsav".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Steam (if your game is Installed on Steam) :
"C:Program Files (x86)Steamuserdata4179320050650remote"
