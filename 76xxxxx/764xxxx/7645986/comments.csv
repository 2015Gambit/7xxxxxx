,N3xS,2012-09-19T21:30Z,"@tufel : In the ""C:UsersDocumentsMy GamesDarksiders2"" you have to copy the whole ""English"" folder of the save you want to play with, not only the ""dsave0.dsav"" and ""dsave4.dsav"". So both files would be inside the English folder, and the english folder will be inside the darksiders 2 folder.
But for Skidrow, you only copy the two files, not the English folder, and it should work."
