[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-20T00:46Z,"Rzrshiv, I knew there were one or two doubles in there.  Errors happen.  I didn't know there were five.  I guess I should be flattered that you're following my torrents this closely.  :) "
,rzrshiv,2012-09-20T15:56Z,Haha. Well since you missed your goal for last year I would hate to see that goal missed again by 5 dups. But obviously you made it this year. Looking forward to 2013. Your efforts are appreciated. Cheers.
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-20T23:23Z,"Rzrshiv, yeah I think I'm looking forward to 2013 as well.  I'm kind of winding down for 2012.  There's not much motivation for me to continue.  I asked everyone if they wanted me to continue 2012 in one of my recent bundles, and I think only one person responded."
,clardx1,2012-09-22T07:27Z,Hey please don't stop I enjoy being able to get all of the music that you supply. I really appreciate all of the work that you are putting in. Like I am looking for Le Andria Johnson the experience. I know that you have helped me with so much music.
,AlKeel,2012-09-22T13:44Z,No don't stop your hard work is appreciated and  you should continue. I've heard amazing music from artists I've never known. Basically this is my radio it's where i hear new songs because i don't listen to the radio. God bless you!
