,mendan,2012-09-24T03:16Z,It's very slow! I'm stuck at 80% and how come upload speed is totally faster than download speed? :(
,eviepunk,2012-09-24T10:16Z,"The upload speed is faster cause there are no seeds, only peers. I'm also stuck at 80%. This is torture."
,valuepack,2012-09-24T18:44Z,No problems here. Download fairly quick given the size of this torrent (about 20 mb). Took 4 hours. Seeding now. Thanks OP!
,caspifx,2012-09-24T21:19Z,does it works at windows 7 32x?
,XxLoneSurvivorxX,2012-09-25T00:00Z,"I dont think this will work. I'll bet most of you will have problems as soon as its done downloading....

For any of you brave souls who think this will work, use PowerISO to mount the Sims 3: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm

If you do not mount the finished Sims 3 file, IT WILL NOT WORK. And I'll be looking over this download for stragglers."
,macht102,2012-09-25T01:53Z,yes it will work with windows 7 32bit
,macht102,2012-09-25T08:05Z,also you dont need to mount this install because its not an iso. it is a setup file made with setup factory 9. 
,TheSheepFarmer,2012-09-25T21:02Z,Download rates from 1MB down to O.1kb... Seed people?
,Avarice6,2012-09-25T22:01Z,Seed please... I'm at a whole 0.2-0.5 kb/s  but I'm 99.4% done
,macht102,2012-09-26T00:01Z,"everyone stuck at 99%, the ""note please read"" is broken. so dont download the text file. and if its the setup.2 that isnt downloading fully let me know and i will reupload torrent. sorry about that my comp glitched out on me and says im uploading at 99% not sure if its true or not."
,Avarice6,2012-09-26T00:35Z,no joke 99.9%
,jbizzle10,2012-09-26T01:12Z,"I am stuck at 99.9%.. Please seed, this is ridiculous!"
,jbizzle10,2012-09-26T01:14Z,"I am stuck at 99.9%, this is hell , please seed!!"
,whatzitooya,2012-09-26T01:26Z,yeah you need to redownload setup 2 its been stuck at 99.7 for a day now
,Nolifegod,2012-09-26T01:44Z,Seed.... this is pretty ridiculous.. 
,macht102,2012-09-26T01:59Z,"FIXED TORRENT: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7673006

Sorry for the problems."
,P2anda,2012-09-27T13:37Z,Am I the only one who isn't able to just install the damn game on another disc than my c-drive? For some reason I can't change the target directory when I start the installation... 
,mtgguy,2012-09-28T07:14Z,"Says that it's stuck at 99.7 of the Setup.2 file. I tried installing it anyways (was taking forever to download), but game crashes. Guess there really is something I need in it, but it won't download. Any help/ideas?"
,Gnuclear,2012-09-28T22:26Z,"If you're stuck at 99.9%, here's what you do:

Add this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7673006

Point it to the same folder as the download for this one, and force re-check."
