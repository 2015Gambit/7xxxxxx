,meagain01,2012-09-16T20:02Z,i guess just even a clue regarding quality is just a hopeless dream :-(
,musclestud1,2012-09-17T00:41Z,shut up meagain!  TV rules are NEVER EVER give ANY info whatsover!  They are strictly uploaders!!
,LJE111,2012-09-17T08:13Z,Here's an idea: How about YOU download a movie first and then comment on the quality?
,evol76,2012-09-19T09:09Z,How do people cry over free... I don't get it.... 
,Calamakuya,2012-09-19T22:42Z,"Regardless of what you all say, one wishes to know if at least is possible to hear the dialogs. It's a human habit."
,cujimmmy,2012-09-20T19:36Z,"They are certainly uploaders but rotten ones at that, very poor."
,BCchicken,2012-09-20T22:09Z,why not just say if its a good copy and stop btchng about everything else..... IT'S FREE....
,Neraforesta,2012-09-22T03:27Z,"STFU all you trolls. I believe that the number one bullshit complainers around here are the ones that try and pie off their self interest on other people by calling other people petty, and saying that other people shouldn't complain because its free. Fuck you...who are you...and what the fuck have you done in your life to believe you are entitled the right to tell other people that they can not post a request without having to deal with your unconstructive ill willed bullshit.  Do us all a favor and just shut it. I personally have been comin here for years now, and all this newbie bullshit is killin me. We...the ones that DL regularly and actually make money for the site make our requests to the uploader in efforts to establish a relationship with them. This is all in efforts to make more money for them. So before you come across with that tired ass shit, go ahead and write your comments on a piece of sand paper, fold it in have and fuck yourself with it."
