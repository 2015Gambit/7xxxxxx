,Ravenicus,2012-09-16T16:50Z,Thanks for this! My first up to date One Piece episode... I don't know if I can keep watching it like this. One episode a week isn't nearly enough!
,kambengurooon,2012-09-16T17:40Z,i have full episodes of one piece. wohooo!
,xhizors,2012-09-16T19:39Z,"@Ravenicus: Haha, I don't watch for weeks just so I can have a couple episodes to watch back to back. "
,WiseShot,2012-09-17T17:15Z,"First of all great job on the torrent :) We really appreciate it. Second, the opening theme is a bit off... When the guy says ich, ni, sunshine, yon, we go! and it's translated One, two, three, sunshine, four, we go. Yon is actually five and sunshine is actually a clever thingamabob for sun shi (three four). anyway that's it! "
,xhizors,2012-09-19T07:42Z,@WiseShot: Translations are done by Funimation :P
