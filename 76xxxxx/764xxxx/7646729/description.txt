Twist, turn, and  move  like never before with fun, motion
controlled  experiences  that  come  bundled  with the Wii
Remote  Plus controller! Grip  it  like  an  umbrella, and
tilt  it  around your body to ride gusts that blow you up,
down, and  to  the  finish line of a windy race course, or
hold  the  controller like a mallet to strike pesky vermin
from  stealing  vegetables  from  your garden. Players can
even  point  the controller around the  room  to help find
and  capture  invisible  spooks! With  multiple difficulty
modes and  game  variations to unlock, up to 4 players can
get  caught up  in the big  action of the Wii Play: Motion
game. For  anyone  looking  to  pick up another Wii Remote
Plus controller, Wii Play: Motion  is a  great value  that
features 12 games and a bundled Wii Remote Plus controller
