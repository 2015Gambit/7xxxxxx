I see that many people are looking for this DISCOGRAPHY of SOUL II SOUL. A previous torrent stops at 82 percent and never restarts. I found the missing songs and have included them for a COMPLETE DISCOGRAPHY. Hope you all enjoy this group because I certainly did during the late 80s and into the 90s
