Synopsis - In 1937, Japan occupied Nanjing, the Chinese capital. There was a battle and 
subsequent atrocities against the inhabitants, especially those who took refuge in the 
International Security Zone.

This is the Japanese film City of Life and Death with hardcoded English subtitles. The film is in 
720p, and the audio is stereo 96kb. This was made as a request, and I figured I can't be the only 
person that hates it when the sub files aren't picked up when streaming films through the home.

Please seed!!! And remember, sharing is caring!!!
