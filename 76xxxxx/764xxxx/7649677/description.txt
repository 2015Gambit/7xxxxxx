Borderlands 2 furthers the distinct blending of First Person Shooter and Role
Playing genres to create the true evolution of the Role Playing Shooter. Team up
with up to three other players for four-player online goodness or go old-school
with two-player split-screen couch sharing mayhem as you spend hours leveling up
your character and equipping them with one of the millions of badass weapons.
Borderlands 2 features a new visually stunning array of procedurally generated
guns, shields, grenades, artifacts, enemies and more. Choose one of the four new
character classes to be taken through a carefully crafted and connected story to
all new and surprising environments across the living planet of Pandora. Make
new friends, arm them to the teeth and fight alongside them on your relentless
quest for revenge and redemption.
