,FatBoxx,2012-09-18T17:54Z,"Wtf is a ""Premier Club Edition"" and why does this have no seeders? Also it's only 4.69 GB whereas the Skidrow release is 7.14, something is wrong."

,Darshe42,2012-09-18T17:57Z,"I gotta say, just the sound files in a separate torrent would be nice..."
[T],azaq318,2012-09-18T17:57Z,"FatBoxx

It is a RePack. Everything is fine here."
,Mahoraba3,2012-09-18T17:57Z,Would be awesome of you to upload the audio/subtitle files as DepressiveMan68 has indicated.
,ween01,2012-09-18T17:58Z,"Wtf, no seeders. What is the point of this torrent????????????????"
,Darshe42,2012-09-18T17:58Z,^ disregard that. and Thanks!
,Mahoraba3,2012-09-18T17:58Z,"Forget my last comment, for some reason I was unable to see that comment link until I posted a comment..."
[T],azaq318,2012-09-18T17:58Z,Dont forget to block your internet to play the game!
,FatBoxx,2012-09-18T17:59Z,"Also, I can't see any comments for this torrent and this one only..."
,nefariousP1G,2012-09-18T18:04Z,does this work!?
,Cr4ck_69,2012-09-18T18:22Z,Does it come with the crack
,IceBlueCat,2012-09-18T18:53Z,does this actually work for coop via hamachi or stuff like that?
,tops.c,2012-09-18T19:01Z,This was only for XBOX PS3
,sbseed,2012-09-18T20:00Z,amazing to see how many people dont know how to use the refresh button on the browser... or just cant read lol.
,beardred,2012-09-18T20:59Z,"thanks again, as always Azaq, love your uploads.

but people, please be decent enough to share the love if you have been able to download the full game.

seeding is what keeps these things going for other people. im uploading at 400kBs and only downloading at 100kBs, so come on people."
,cost69,2012-09-18T21:50Z,"it's working! great game!

,Pharmit24,2012-09-19T06:23Z,This looks like 3 times repack lol...the first one was 13gb then skidrow 7gb and urs 4gb..what was the repack files for urs?
,Pharmit24,2012-09-19T06:33Z,And also what's the difference between premier club edition and normal borderlands 2?? thanks.
,tops.c,2012-09-19T09:22Z,It don't work
,ween01,2012-09-19T10:31Z,"It does work for me. Just a question, when i change direction in the game a kind of hazy shimmer appears for a second is this normal?"
,ween01,2012-09-19T10:33Z,"It does work, am playing it now"
,Philonetic,2012-09-19T12:14Z,"Working perfectly for single player.
Thanks azaq, outstanding torrent.
Confirmed all npc voices working, perfect repack (except no LAN play arg!)

Anyone have news on getting LAN play to work?  We're dying to try co-op but can't connect to each others game.  Tried tunngle + smartsteam with no luck."
,Philonetic,2012-09-19T12:16Z,"Also only plays in x32 dx9   ????
Any way to get a higher DX version working with this?"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-09-19T12:54Z,Worked fine for me on Windows 7 64bit Ultimate. Haven't tried lan play yet.
,coreninja,2012-09-19T13:47Z,"are you able to upload the different ""premier"" files from this release so that they can be copied and overwrite the files from the regular borderlands 2?"
,whateverthefuck,2012-09-19T15:31Z,"I'm already downloading the Skidrow version, so I'm wondering, what's so special about this ""Premier Club Edition"". Anyone? I mean, are there any extras that come with this?"
,gonmanmun,2012-09-19T17:30Z,"@whateverthefuck Hello brother, the premiere club edition contains a Golden key which allows you to open a secret chest somewhere in the game, a relic that gives u 5% more rare item find and 3 gold guns to start with. BUT there is absolutely no need to download this one since the skidrow version includes the premiere club edition extras aswell. Tested and confirmed"
,genocide44,2012-09-19T18:59Z,is this rip in english?
,orange7,2012-09-20T16:02Z,Its interesting that the english audio files wont work for me until I block the game from the internet.
,myprecious121,2012-09-21T08:17Z,i have to problem with game crashing at the loading screen as well. any solution for this?
