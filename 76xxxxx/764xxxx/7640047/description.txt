But things are about to get much worse. A nuclear bomb has been planted in Los Angeles. 
President David Palmer has no choice but to call Jack back to CTU for another day of hardships. 
Mason, the new head, is, of course, not happy about this. 
Now, his daughter Kim is running from her employer, who is threatening to kill her. 
Palmer now must deal with his political staff, most of which are plotting against his actions on how to deal with the crisis. 
And Jack must face the toughest challenge of his life... finding the bomb with aid from the woman who killed his wife, Nina Myers. 

The clock is ticking.
