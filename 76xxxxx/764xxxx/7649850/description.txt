Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Anita Rani and Justin Rowlatt, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Anita Rani and Justin Rowlatt embark on two epic car journeys across China, navigating congested cities and winding mountain roads, to explore how the country's economic growth, symbolised by its booming car industry, is affecting people's lives.



Part 2.
Anita and Justin continue their epic car journeys across China, heading for their final destination, the financial mega-city of Shanghai. On her route through the industrialised east, Anita visits some of the country's most sophisticated and luxurious cities. In Qingdao she discovers a little piece of the Loire valley: a Chinese wine chateau with an accompanying vineyard. In Hangzhou she joins a couple on their wedding day, complete with a luxury car fleet. Meanwhile Justin continues his epic journey through the poor, remote Chinese countryside in his loaf-shaped bread van. He bumps rather precariously up the potholed Aizhai Highway, one of China's most dangerous roads, and visits the brand new engineering marvel of the Aizhai Bridge. He explores the life of farmers from the Miao ethnic minority deep in the Hunan countryside, and tries to get to the bottom of Mao Zedong's legacy in contemporary China.
