Hey Guys!
Another soundtrack here.

This time it's the soundtrack from the pc port of Namco Bandai and From Software's Dark Souls- Prepare to Die Edition.


When you listen to it you can just imagine getting the shit beaten out of you over and over by monstrous demons. WHAT FUN!





They all work just dandy.

23 tracks, each titled. too easy.

As per usual, if you like it please seed and leave a quick comment to show appreciation.

Enjoy!
