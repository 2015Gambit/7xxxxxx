Adriatique - Body MovinΓÇÖ EP

Although theyΓÇÖve shared credits on some Diyanmic 12ΓÇ¥ compilations over the last few years, AdriatiqueΓÇÖs Body MovinΓÇÖ EP represents the duoΓÇÖs first full release for the German imprint. And you get the impression from this four-track collection that the Swiss duo are more than ready for their chance, that theyΓÇÖre chomping at the bit for the chance to prove themselves.

Pleasingly, the four tracks present serve as a very impressive calling card for AdriatiqueΓÇÖs Adrian Schweizer and Adrian Shala. Opening cut Deeper Love sets EPΓÇÖs the soulful, nostalgic hue with its amorous vocals, gloom-tinged synths and a funk-slapped guitar that emerges mid-way through. A tender breakdown accentuate the trackΓÇÖs groove and strut, giving it a gloriously summer sound.

By Your Side also looks back to the past, crafting a classic house sound through its deep bass , climbing chords and distant Gospel influenced vocals.

The proceeding Motions stays on the bubbling synth and guitar tipple. ItΓÇÖs a slow, no-frills low slung fusion of disco and house sensibilities, with a hypnotic vocal and dark synths warping into big drops and reprisals, that confirm it a dancefloor number regardless of its BPM.

Body MovinΓÇÖ closes the package in style, offering a distinct final flavour with its up-front pads and squelching pads. However itΓÇÖs the use of a vocoder vocal hook that gives the track its infectious edge and confirms it as a future terrace weapon.

Adriatique have clearly had their ears to the floor in the last two years; the gestalt of melody, breakdowns and basslines are certain to make this a package that works across the house and disco board. And with the four synth-heavy cuts oozing more funk and soul than youΓÇÖre likely to hear in half a dozen lesser EPs, expect to hear much more from these two in the coming months.
