A great deal happened for the San Francisco indie folk duo Two Gallants in the five years that followed the release of their self-titled third album. The band went on hiatus for a while, guitarist Adam Haworth Stephens and drummer Tyson Vogel each released solo albums, and in 2010, Stephens nearly lost his life in a van accident while on tour in Wyoming. Returning to active duty in 2012, Two Gallants are a changed band on The Bloom and the Blight, or at the very least, they've given their studio approach a serious overhaul. On their first three albums, Two Gallants performed with a scrappy immediacy that was informed by both country and indie rock, like the quieter, bass-less children of Uncle Tupelo, but The Bloom and the Blight is the work of a band that has come to rock.
