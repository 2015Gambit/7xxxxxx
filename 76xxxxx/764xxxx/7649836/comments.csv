Must be a re-encode of this then: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7649547"
,kellogg9,2012-09-18T21:06Z,"Curious...why do people claim its 720p when the video isnt??

For those who are fapping to the thought of posting a video and arbitrarily labeling everything as 720p, a real 720p video is: 1280x720 in resolution."

You're a noob.
They don't encode the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.
It's 720p still. 
Don't talk about something you clearly have no expertise in whatsoever."
