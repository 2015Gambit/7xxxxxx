,lizardomanson,2012-09-17T12:49Z,"Thanks, i still use avi because my dvd player usb port dont read mp4."
,AriGold45,2012-09-17T13:43Z,Thanks so much for uploading the .AVI... My computer is from 2000 and for some reason .avi is the only one it will play without skipping or blacking out.
,WrestleManiaC,2012-09-19T02:11Z,"avi is the only format guaranteed to play on my PS3.  all the others are hit or miss.  Thanks, you rule."
,annabananabee,2012-09-21T23:53Z,"Yes thank you for the avi, we use xbox to watch on tv and it wont play other files.  Also my computer won't play the others properly either.  It is so nice to have the avi option. I have noticed a lot of these are only available in mp4s lately too, so thanks so much!"
,M16A3,2012-09-23T02:28Z,"Yep, Thanks for the .avi format as i use to watch it on my PS3"
,Sabvegas,2012-09-24T00:28Z,Thank you very much for the .avi! 
,petermartyn1,2012-09-28T12:36Z,Same here on the AVIs - thanks as the stupid MP4s do not read on anything other than computer and who watches on computer ? So much nicer to view on big TV
