"The Future in the Past"

Having been accused of murder, 
Brennan is on the run from the FBI, 
with help from her father Max. Booth 
and the Jeffersonian team are 
convinced evil tech genius 
Christopher Pelant has manipulated 
key evidence in the case to pinpoint 
Brennan as the prime suspect. Then, 
an anonymous tip leads the team to 
the remains of a high school 
guidance counselor that may hold the 
key to proving Brennan's innocence.
