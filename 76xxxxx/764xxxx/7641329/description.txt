Information
------------------------------

Journey into lush jungle foliage, up fog-bathed mountains, under flaming desert sands, back in time. How would it feel to be the first one, to be a bold explorer, to make a one-of-a-kind discovery? Return to the golden age of exploration as five men set out into the world to make their names. This exciting five-episode Discovery Channel series will take you to South Africa, the Gobi Desert, the Andes Mountains, Egypt's Valley of the Kings, and the islands of Crete and Santorini to discover the missing link in human evolution, the bones of new dinosaur species, the lost city of the Inca, the undisturbed tomb of King Tutankhamun, and the lost civilization of the Minoans.



5)  Tutankhamun - The Last Pharaoh 
Deep in the Valley of the Kings, ancient Egyptian rulers lay buried beneath tons of rubble in tombs of astonishing complexity. Despite the many raids conducted by grave robbers, the tomb of the boy-king, Tutankhamun, eludes discovery until English adventurer Howard Carter uncovers the clues that reveal the hidden labrynthian catacombs. Despite the fame and wealth they achieve, Carter and his team are dogged by tragedy, believed by many to be the manifestation of The Curse of Tutankhamun. Tutankhamun provides an exceptional view of the discovery of the ages and the haunted men who lived to regret their great achievement.
