I, and probably others, are at 93% for quite a while."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-09-18T01:57Z,I answered this quite awhile ago. As this file is almost a year old I am not able  to grant your request as the file was removed several months ago.

Righto, I didn't see the answer when you wrote it, or at least forgot the answer."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-09-18T16:09Z,"@l214l: I may still have this on a back-up BR-disc, but it will take quite a while to look for it . Only so many hours in a day."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-09-18T21:53Z,@l214l : Seeding your request as of now.
,l214l,2012-09-20T12:34Z,"Yes, thanks. Patience has paid off, I have the file now.  I am seeding two others at the moment, and will continue to do so.

Congrats for the green skull."
