,BretLeduc,2012-09-18T23:57Z,I just voted this movie down (in the Quality: section above) because the video quality is rather poor and I'm in the process of making a better quality file.  I will post it shortly and post the link here as well :)
,BretLeduc,2012-09-25T11:32Z,"Hi again!

Im currently uploading a MUCH better version (1.26GB AVI with perfect video/audio quality and aspect) into Microsoft SkyDrive.  I will post a link here when it's done so you can download it directly without having to wait for people to download it and hope that they leave their laptops open :)

I tested this new version on Windows and Mac, under several programs and it works fine.  Unfortunately, it gives the ""unsupported data"" error on the PS3.  If anyone knows how to fix this (I tried using several programs and nothing worked), please fix it and repost, and let us know here too!

One more thing.  When I played this new AVI in VLC, the aspect was correct (widescreen) by default.  When I played it in DivX Player, I had to change to aspect in the menu."
