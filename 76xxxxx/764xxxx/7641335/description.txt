This is my first ever torrent upload.

This movie is my favorite.  It's about a couple of girls frolicking around New York in 1984.

I ripped this myself from a DVD using Toast Titanium.  It was my first attempt at ripping a DVD and it was a few months ago, so I don't remember the settings.  The video quality is rather poor, but it's better than YouTube.
The spoken language is English.  There are no subs.
I have not been able to find this movie online anywhere except on YouTube (in 19 parts).
