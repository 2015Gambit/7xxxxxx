Summary :

After breaking out of a moon-based maximum security prison, Boris the Animal decides to go back in time and eliminate

the person who arrested him - Agent K. When he does so, Agent J realizes that the time line has been changed and he too

travels back to July 15, 1969, the day before Agent K is killed. After overcoming some disbelief, J manages to convince

K and others of just who he is and why he's there. With the help of a being who can see all time lines, they track Boris

down. J also learns a secret, something K had never told him.
