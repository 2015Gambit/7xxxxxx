,Teshin,2012-09-17T00:21Z,"come on people, comment it... is it watchable?"
,frailwordscollapse,2012-09-17T00:25Z,"Thanks! This is probably the best copy so far. Only watched the sample, but I'm sure the rest of it is fine."
,frailwordscollapse,2012-09-17T01:00Z,Watching it right now and it's excellent. Will seed as long as necessary. Thanks again!

V: 9
A: 5/6"
,Discobee,2012-09-17T23:03Z,Anyone have English subs?
,FireIsHot,2012-09-18T01:26Z,"Looks Pretty Good, Judging from sample and screens I'd guess A/V 7/8. 

Great for a TS, better than any copy I've found, with the exception being the loss of color in this, it's kinda washed out.

Thanks for the up, and @ZENOCHERRY, there is no way this is better than DVD, maybe a really poorly done compression of a DVD down to 700mb, like a copy of ""The Five-Year Engagement"" I downloaded last month.

,nonobvious,2012-09-18T02:10Z,TS SHOULD NOT BE IN THE HD SECTION!
[H],EverybodyLies,2012-09-18T02:34Z,All 720p videos are HD. The quality of the video is not considered while classifying it.
,andrewjho,2012-09-18T03:51Z,"Compared to other movies in this section, the quality of this particular torrent is NOT up to standard."
,mac_user777,2012-09-18T12:07Z,THIS MOVIE WAS SHIT!!!
,mac_user777,2012-09-18T12:07Z,But thanks Horrorspoke for the upload.
,esteban972,2012-09-19T07:19Z,Best copy ive seen so far!
,JAYNICOLE4ALWAYS,2012-09-19T22:11Z,you need to learn how to focus all through the movie the focus goes out other then that it was fine i'd say a/10 v/4
,sheriff88,2012-09-19T22:50Z,Not terrible for a TS but a movie like this should simply not be viewd in this quality.

,axiotrd,2012-09-22T13:12Z,"This is a cinema copy. Quality acceptable but there are several scenes at the end lost focus for a while. Overall, not bad."
