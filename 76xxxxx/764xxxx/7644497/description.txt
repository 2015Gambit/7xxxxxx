Every spring, across 700,000 square miles of flatland between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains USA, changing weather patterns and colliding air masses combine to create the recipe for catastrophe and the Storm Chasers are there to capture it all. Battling extreme weather conditions and each other, the images and data they find inside the Tornadoes could help decode the secrets of natures most intense storms.
 
Join Meteorologist Reed Timmer, IMAX filmmaker Sean Casey and weather engineer Tim Samaras - armed with their 14,000lb TIV and wits of steel - as they venture head first into natures unleashed fury.
