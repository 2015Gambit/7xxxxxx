Hatchi is a retro-looking Android app sure to get the nostalgia burning for all those who cared for a virtual pet back in the 1990s when they were at the height of their popularity. Just as with the keychain-sized pets of the 90s, you can now feed, clean, play with and generally look after your pets to ensure they grow up to be healthy, happy little Hatchis.

Your Hatchi monster will go through several stages of growth, and will evolve differently depending on the quality of care the player provides.
