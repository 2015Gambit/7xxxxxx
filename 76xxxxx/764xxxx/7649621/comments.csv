Wouldn't it be simpler to put the remaining 27 years out as one torrent? I would seed them all indefinitely..."

However, it's like 6. something Gigabytes, had like 2 seeds and it's all in one iso image. So when I downloaded the file it took forever and ever.

I like the idea of picking and choosing what files and shorter download time. Also, I'm putting it out like this in the hopes that it will be a slightly healthier seeding."
