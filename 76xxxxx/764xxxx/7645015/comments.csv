,k81689,2012-09-17T22:44Z,Is this real 480p or just 400p?
,k81689,2012-09-18T00:13Z,"Downloaded first eps, check, and cursed
It is 704x400.
Get a mediaino.exe and post the real res.
There is no need to lie about it."

[V],twentyforty,2012-09-20T14:44Z,"If one can read, of course - frame size is explicitly mentioned both in nfo and scree-shots.
640x480 pixels is 480p for 4X3 AR.
704-720x400 for 16x9.
Idiots gets wrong numbers by not been capable understanding what terms ""progressive"", ""interlaced"", ""square pixels"" and ""non-square pixels"" mean and together with Aspect Ratio form final frame size.

However, I can put in name whatever I want, right?

480p or 480i is native frame format of DVD and SDTV and as for computers - as 640x480 for 4:3 AR and square pixels (16x9 displays are 4 years old as new market-standard)  - defined probably before most of you have been born."
