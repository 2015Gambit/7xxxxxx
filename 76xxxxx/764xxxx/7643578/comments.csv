,BranHun,2012-09-29T11:35Z,"THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing. I needed the 4 bonus/special edition tracks most of all. I am having trouble downloading. I am fairly new to uTorrent, so I do not understand what it means when it says: ""The file you are trying to DL is already added to the list of torrents. Would you like to add trackers?"" or something like that. HELP! (btw, you rock...AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH)!"
