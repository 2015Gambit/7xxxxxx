Andras Field is located at the foot of the alps in southern Bavaria, near the German/Swiss/Austrian border. Sixty minutes of fast cruising you can be in Milan for an evening of opera or in Berlin for some serious shopping. It started out as a military airport (the complete history is on the forum) and you will still see many parts that remind you of this past life. 

Andras Field has a wide 5000 feet runway suitable for heavy aircraft (it used to be a military airport after all), a 6000 feet water runway, helicopter landing sites and even a long glider grass strip. Both the seaplane base as the airport got hangar space for visitors and for larger aircraft based on Andras Field. The project is very much intended to cater for all kinds of FSX flying.
