Heads up, found these in pieces online, its not the complete set, sorry, they werent there. Now as for quality, on a big tv looks like crap, small player, not so much. So don't be expecting HD quality here they weren't collected in that format. And the downloading of the "HD Links" were trash and useless cuz they kept dropping 0 byte files on me instead. So I didnt tamper any further than recombining the pieces back together to make full episodes. We need Episodes 17,20,21,22 in full. I'm not sure how many I'm actually missing past 23, its just all that i could find. Trying to show my kid how many different Voltrons there were in the past before this new Voltron Force cartoon showed up to prove it wasn't a new concept at all.
