The first new Saint comic book in America in over 60 years! The Robin Hood of modern crime returns! He robs from the evil and heartless rich, and gives to the wronged and deserving poor - in the process, keeping a percentage for his own expenses. He doesn't work for the law, the government, or anyone else. He is a lone wolf, an adventurer, a detective, a rogue, but always a gentleman! The Saint travels to Texas in pursuit of a man who has been sabotaging weapons factories, but when his quarry turns up burned to crisp, he has to contend with both the local police, a trio of mysterious men behind the sabotage, and a beautiful Russian. This issue is a preview of the upcoming graphic novel, and it will be the only time this story will be seen in color!
