Book Description
================
THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE
by Philip K. Dick
Narrated by George Guidall
-A Hugo Award Winner

In his critically-acclaimed science fic-
tion novel, Philip K. Dick creates a shock-
ing vision of the United States of the 60s
that stands in direct opposition to 
history's
records of that uninhibited decade. The
Axis have won World War II, Japan and
Germany occupy America, Nazi rockets
rule the skies, and slaves again are forced to
serve harsh masters.
