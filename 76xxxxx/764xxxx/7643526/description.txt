Book Description
================
From the Inside Flap
What could an omnipresent and seemingly omnipotent entity want with 
a humble pot-healer? Or with the dozens of other odd creatures it has 
lured to Plowman's Planet? And if the Glimmung is a god, are its ends 
positive or malign? Combining quixotic adventure, spine-chilling horror, 
and deliriously paranoid theology, Galactic Pot-Healer is a uniquely 
Dickian voyage to alternate worlds of the imagination. 


Amazon Reviewer
According to the author's biographer, Laurence Sutin, Dick didn't much 
care for this book. I can't imagine why, except that in his more determinedly 
resolute moments he may have considered the ending too patly pessimistic. 
I agree with Sutin's rating: Pot-Healer is a gem. Rarely for Dick, it 
has only a single point-of-view character, the pot-healer (not mender), 
stranded in a Stalinist USA of the 2040s, who is somewhat circuitously 
approached by the Glimmung - a possibly divine, certainly whimsical 
entity of faraway Plowman's Planet. The Glimmung is putting together 
a collaborative enterprise of life-forms from around the galaxy in order 
to raise a sunken cathedral, and along the way our hero meets with some 
spectacular inconveniences, including his own corpse and a book in which 
his future (or one of them) is inscribed (possibly), occasionally in 
language he can understand. This is one of Dick's funniest and most 
enjoyable books, putting a light touch to many of his favourite issues. 
It's as packed with energy and invention as any of his more famous works 
and, perhaps because of the single point of view, feels more focused 
and coherent than many - and this in spite of the fact that its epic 
plot and impressive special effects all take place within the space 
of less than a hundred and eighty pages.
