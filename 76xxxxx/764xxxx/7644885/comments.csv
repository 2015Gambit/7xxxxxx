V/6 (somewhat blurry)
A/5 (there was a distortion the whole way through the movie although apart from being super annoying it doesn't stop u from understanding what the characters r saying)
M/2 (wow, this was bad)

Does anyone else remember Rae Dawn Chong from the 80's/90's? She was awesome...sadly those days r long behind her. "

The technical name for what you got is 'contact diarrhea'. On the plus side, it's nice to have a clean out. :) "
