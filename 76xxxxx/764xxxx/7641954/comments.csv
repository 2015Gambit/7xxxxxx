,Kenso19,2012-09-16T15:25Z,"Good job HeroMaster, but iam wating for the pc version on this one. When is it coming gahhh!!!"

,phlak69,2012-09-16T18:05Z,When we burn can we truncate or is the iHas burner a must have on this game?  Sorry I have been just doing the truncate method on the games that work by doing that.  Thank you for the torrent I will seed!
,Smallz94,2012-09-16T18:43Z,Guys i download the torrrent from the other uploader. I use the truncate method and then i got an error in my xbox360 while i was playing so use ihas burner i guess which i dont even have one :/ I will download from this guy but pretty sure it is the same thing that is going to give me problems. message me or whatever to let me know i should not download this. 
,shadbaze,2012-09-16T19:11Z,XDG3 Games wont function correctly without an ihas. http://www.abgx.net/filename/?ch=6 as you can see here borderlands 2 is XDG3.

,The_Human,2012-09-16T23:12Z,"Downloaded other torrent, didn't mess with the ISO, burned it, installed it, ran it till I got an error, deleted it from my HDD, played off disc for about an hour, got disc unreadable. I'm re-installing it to my HDD and I'm gonna try and continue through that process. I don't have an ihas and used the truncate option. "

,twohearts_left,2012-09-17T04:30Z,i pretty sure its because it wasnt verified by the abgx360 database. thats why it says game isnt verified after a short time.

,xboxmodder305,2012-09-18T21:53Z,@ taloohi101 I would wait till it's Verified on ABGX360 cause of the fact that CRCs might not match! That's begging for a ban... This is the second time I'm DLing this game cause the other copy from Alik0 was a bad rip. BTW: Thanks uploader! I hope this checks out okay. I'm DLing now.

,KockBurn,2012-09-19T03:07Z,"Thnx for the up!! All you guys to cheap to buy a iHas burner deserve to get a ban, truncuate doesnt cut it for XGD3, and the others asking how to flash or use this file really have no business here.

,windefredrik,2012-09-19T17:29Z,"Hi!
Is this realy lt+3.0? why is the name on the fil called lt+2.0?
the reson i ask is beacuse now i have burnd over 5 dvds and no one works. I have tride on cloncd and in imgburn (latest version), i have tride whit verbatime and other dvd`s. I have the new flash 3.0....but still this dosen`t work for me.......workt perfekt for 2 days ago when i burnd tekken tag.....but not whit this borderlands 2. WTF is wrong....i tried 2,4 X speed and 16X speed....i will try again whit 4X. but i dont think thats the problem. I check it whit abgx....dosent work....it says lt v 2.0??"
,windefredrik,2012-09-19T21:52Z,"Hi again.....now i have ceck it whit abgx and it made a fix about the ""topology""?? burnd it whit imgburn at the speed of 4X. for the first time in 6 dvds the xbox started the game, but i onley got to the intro and i get a ""disc unreadable2 :(...wtf??"
,SeNoRxSmOkEy,2012-09-19T22:33Z,@windefredrik you need liteon ihas 124 burner
,briebee72,2012-09-20T00:46Z,"OK so as of 9/19/2012.. this game works perfect if!!!  OK listen people if!!! you have lt3.0 (latest firmware) and burn the game with an IHAS drive ...  GO GET AN IHAS DRIVE AND UPDATE YOUR FIRM WARE for gods sake. and you wont have to keep coming here asking why your games dont work.

this image (as uploaded)  has the lt2.0 topology so if you burn it as is with out running it through abgx360 first then NO it will not work on updated firmwares. you will have to run the game through abgx360 to update the topology. 

If you are still rockin lt2.0 or have a dvdrom in your xbox360 that cant run lt3.0 then leave the image as is and burn it for the correct topology. 

either way you need to burn all new games with a IHAS burner  and you will stop making coasters. for the cost of the coasters you are burning you can buy an ihas drive from newegg. and do things right.

some new games can be burned useing imgburn and not useing a ihas burner image burn will truncate the game image(take parts out) and fit it to your disk size.  but seriously you are removing parts of the game when you do this and some games not all but some and i think this is one of them need all the info from the disk so trucating this image will cause problems.  just liek forza 4 did forza 4 is a well know game that can not be trucated and you have to over burn the blank dvds with a ihas drive. 

for gods sake just drop the 20 bucks get a ihas drive and stop pulling your hair out wondering why your games dont work.

This image works fine as i said because i burning it correctly and have current firmware that is all. best of luck.

here ill even help here is a list of ihas drives on new egg pickone that works for you and get it http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&N=-1&isNodeId=1&Description=ihas&x=0&y=0"

I have spent days reading about this on forums, and everybodey have a diffrent point of fixing this. Don`t know if I whant to go and by another burner, I don`t think that will help....or will it??"

,windefredrik,2012-09-21T00:07Z,"Downloaded borderlands 2 and did an ""overburn"", Put it in to my flashed xbox LT+3.0 didn`t work, got the ""disc unredeable"". I have used different brands on the dvd`s, but normally verbatime of curse. I have tried with games that have been comfirmed in abgx360 and those that haven`t. I have burned in all different speeds, I have used the old imgburn and the latest (2.5.7.0), I have tried to do ”overburn” and ""truncet"", I have used the 2 different options in layerbreaker. I have used my normal burner: HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT30N ATA DEVICE. I have used my new computers burner: TSSTCORP CDDVDW SH-22AB ATA DEVICE. I have also read that many others with the burner ”liteon ihas” have this issue, so don`t ask me to go and bye a new burner. I have tried to install the game on to my harddrive, that works 100% but when i want to play it`s ”disc unredeable” , What is the problem here? could it be that we think the LT+ 3.0 works but it dosen`t?"
,briebee72,2012-09-21T02:21Z,"windefredrik: how are you over burning it if you are not useing an ihas burner?? no other burners overburn.  allso if you are useing lt3.0 this game has 2.0 topology. you have to update this games topology to the 3.0 version in order to run it. that can be done with abgx360.  as for getting a new burner or not well thats your call all I can tell you is I have been a seinor member of xbox360mods forums for years now I have NEVER had any issues with burning games EVER and I do it the right way complete over burn with verified images on ihas burners and im playing this game just fine.  I have never short cut the process and truncated any game. common sence would tell you when you trucate a game you are removing game data and if you remove game data well stands to reason then some games wont work right. its about the same as taking a wheel off you car sure it will maybe still drive but how well?

so anyway you guys keep playing music first, burning 10 coasters, posting countless posts about how you cant get it to work, blame the poster of the image, tell everyone else they are stupid for saying to get ihas drives and well... Ill sit here and enjoy the game while you dont so.. the choice is yours.  when you truncate a game you are cutting off almost 200 megs of the game image would stand to reason if the game didnt need that last 200 megs then why did the game makers put it there???   Like i said a ihas burner is 16 bucks really your gona drive your self nuts over 16 bucks??  I am sure you have wasted more then that in coasters!!  alos just some info pirate bay is NOT the place to come looking for help. you need to go read up on a reputable website for modding like 360mods.net  they have answers for just about anything and if not just ask most moderators will answer fairly quick. but your gonna get the same answers there they are gonna tell ya if your running lt3.0 then you should be over burning your disks on an ihas drive."

Can someone be so kind and help me ASAP!

What am I doing wrong?"
,taloohi101,2012-09-22T01:13Z,"Barcelona88, just having an ihas is not enough. You need to make sure that it an an ihas b model such as 124b or 524b. They don't sell them in most places anymore but easily found on eBay. 

Secondly, your iHas burner MUST be flashed in order to read and burn 8.7GB onto the disc. You can do it yourself (youtube) or buy one perflashed, again from eBay. If you have a flashed iHas b burner, then you are ready to burn and you WON'T be asked to truncate. When you insert a disc your computer should show 8.13GB free instead of 7.96. I hope this helps. "

,briebee72,2012-09-22T02:53Z,"barcelona88: The game image as downloaded has the topology for lt2.0. You are running lt3.0 so you have to run the image through abgx360 in order to update the topology data for lt3.0 if you do not do this you are gonna get disk unreadable errors.
1.download abgx360 2. erase all files you downloaded with this game image everything but the image itself. 3. run the image through abgx360 with auto fix set to level 3.  .. abxg360 will fix the image replace the 2.0 topology with the correct 3.0 topology and it will create a proper dvd file for image burn with the correct layer break info. 4. then just click the dvd file created by abgx360 and image burn will auto launch and  you just click burn...

now all this is taking for granted you have the proper ihas burner and it is flashed correctly with the current firmware to allow over burning and this will work.

to everyone else. honestly I have no idea why everyone is having such problems with this game. READ people READ READ READ>  if you have lt3.0 on your xbox360 then NO THIS GAME WONT WORK AS IS you have to update it with correct topology info with abgx360. no matter how you burn it it will not work if you have not updated it. This image as is has topology for lt2.0. so go figure then people with 2.0 are running it through angx360 then complaining it dont work well duh!!! you just updated it to 3.0 for gods sake people read."
,briebee72,2012-09-22T03:03Z,also one more thing just having an ihas burner will not burn these disks you have to upgrade the burners dirmware to alow it to over burn the disks. again a ihas burning just out of the box will not over burn these disks like needed you have to upgrade the burners firmware NOT ITS DRIVERS but its firmware. a full guide to do this is located here http://www.team-xecuter.com/forums/showthread.php?t=73745 read read read it first then do the firmware upgrade.  Look microsoft is making this harder and harder if your not willing to put the time in to do it right then you need to go get your games from gamestop because you are gonna waste more time and money here then just buying the games retail.  But if you invest the time to set things up right then burning your backup games will be fast and work perfect everytime.  if you are one of those who wont listen and is allways trying to short cut everything well then you deserve the agravation you are causeing yourself.

I did a VERY long text message about what I did to try play this game....i have also done this for many years. And i use my burner in my computer....it has never been flashed or anything and i have burnd games thata are xgd3 games for almost a year with cloncd and overburn just fine....you DON`T need a ihas burner for that. That is also why many that have an ihas burner ALSO have this problem.
And one thing: ofcurse i ceck the game in abgx360. it was ok, i use verbatime, i have tried cloncd and the latest imgburn, i have tried overburn and truncate, i have burned in ALLA the different speeds.....but nothing works......NOW i have to do the MP3 trick to play....it WORKS but it`s not fun.

BUT i will see if i can find a ihas burner....is this a seperate burner? lika a portable? or is this a burner that are supposed to build in to a computer?"
,briebee72,2012-09-22T22:14Z,"ok seriously this is the last post im gonna do on this i have put all the info out there i have put links to tutorials i have tried to help more then anyone and you gys just arent reading or its not getting through to you i dont know which.

windefredrik: you have NOT been over burning with clone cd it may have told it was but I can promise you it was not. there is NO WAY to over burn a dvd dl with out an ihas drive that has had burnmax firmware installed. If you have figured out a way to do it with that piece of crap software clonecd then you my friend need to join the hacking community and post a detailed tutorial because you will be held high as a god. bottom line you have not been over burning dvds with clone cd period. I dont care what you say. just because the games worked just means they were trucated is all and yes 95% of the game sout there will work truncated but your gonna have the ones like this one that either just wont load or your gonna have to do some stupid pain in the ass mp3 load crap like you are doing. clone cd is a piece of crap and laughable at best everyone uses imageburn because it WORKS. and yes a ihas burner is an internal dvd burner unless you buy a houseing.

barcelona88: I am sorry I could have been clearer. Only delete the .dvd file that came with the image the reason is that abxg360 will recreate a correct dvd file after it auto fixes the game image. then you should use the newly created dvd file to launch image burn. and yes open abgx360 load the borderlands imageinto the software then under the auto fix tab select level 3 so that abgx will completely check the image and fix anything that is wrong with it. other then that my friend i am afraid we have a bit of a launguage barrier as i dont really understand wht it is your asking.

lewhag: thanks for verifiying this iso works truncated and on imageburn. did you leave it with 2.0 topology(as downloaded) or did you run it through abgx360 and fix the topology back to 3.0?  also do you know what version your firnware is? is it lt2.0 or  3.0 thanks man. I think the problem most people are having with this is the topology data they arent useing the correct data for thier firmware and that is where the issues are comming from."
,lewhag,2012-09-25T09:58Z,"Briebiee72: I ran it through abgx and I have lt3...im not a genius at this (and haven´t flashed my box myself). But how hard can it be to just try different methods? When I first tried it, the ""dirty disc"" popped up, but then I realised I didn´t have my hdd in. I restarted the console and put back the hdd and now I´m almost completed the game...don´t know if the hdd have something to do with it but it worked for me! :)"

download + abgx : didnt work, lost 2 dvd.
used xbox backup creator (the may 2012 version is still ok), inject topology bin (the first topo i downloded from internet didnt work, inject fail, it was lttle hard to find the good topo file), burn with imgburn with truncate, using my stock laptop burner 2.4 X and regular memorex dvd double layer. Install in xbox hdd stpped at 39%, tried 2-3 times but same issue. ive repeated the whole thing (inject with xbc, imgburn..), install in xbox hdd now is 100% fine. but still have to do the mp3 trick to not get error after few minutes playing (usb stick with a mp3 song plugged before turn on xbox, play the song and turn sound to min, and then play the game).
By the way, resident evil 6 works also for me using the same process (no abgx at all, xbc, imgburn, memorex dvd and stock laptop burner).
One question : i got many disc errors while i was trying different possibilitites to get this thing work. is there some chance to get banned the day i'll go online to play or just to use netflix for example. (i never played online before). does the xbox store this info in the nand or something and once ure online, ure done? "
