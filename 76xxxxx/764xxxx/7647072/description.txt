Here we go again, September 9th through the 16th. I'm still hoping someone can post the Art Belll SIT shows, I do miss those. Like they used to come out at the other place, these will be posted weekly. I'm on a DSL line.....so it's up to you people to keep this going. I'm not going to seed all night and day and kill my bandwidth. I put it together, you guys keep it moving. Until the other place is back I guess this is my role. If you want to hear some really profound radio....go here:

Jesse Ventura with all seriousness asks Howard Stern to be his Vice President and run together in 2016. It is riveting and powerful. I heard it live and could not believe my ears and think that I just heard the beginning of something, to quote John B, "with a few million of my closest friends", that could change the face of history and humanity since it's actually feasible. A bonus is whatever Dreamland is still posted. It has Linda Multon Howe on it. It's probably good, I haven't listened to it yet to be honest. 'Til next Monday night if everything continues as normal.....
