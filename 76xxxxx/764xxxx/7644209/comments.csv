I'm sure it will help spread the word about the dangers of GMO's.

Many thanks for the great DL! This needs to be shared and talked about.  "

It's actually pretty sad that most people don't seem to realize that modification of our food has been going since man first learned how to farm.  Just do a quick search of corn and learn how it has been modified from its original teosinte wild grass form over the last 7,000 years.  Same with tomatoes and most other foods that we eat.  

""Everything"" has been modified in some form or another and people are living longer than ever.  I'm no fan of these big companies, but you ""chicken littles"" stirring up controversy are equally, if not more-so, duplicitous!"

Instead of writing what immediately came to mind, which would have been a scathing discourse on how ass backwards misinformed you are, I'll try this the *nice way*. There is a HUGE difference between the way someone such as Gregor Mendel went about hybridizing pea plants, and the ways in which it is done now with a gene gun.

They shoot foreign genes into a plant to attain traits such as the plant itself making pesticides, or being able to withstand Monsanto's highly toxic Roundup. Today's food model benefits the chemical companies, not the consumer. 

I think you should do more research into the subject before speaking on this subject. Either you are misinformed, or you are working for/with the multinational agribusiness companies as a disinfo shill. Either/or, you sir are mistaken ;)"
,Blazedbill,2012-09-27T20:19Z,"Oh, and one other thing. The mainstream media (MSM) is not to be trusted. The stocks of the pharmaceutical, media conglomerates, and food manufacturers are very intertwined. As well as a large majority of congress persons having money invested in said stocks, thus ensuring speedy passing of bills that benefit those companies. 

Take that chicken little ;)"
