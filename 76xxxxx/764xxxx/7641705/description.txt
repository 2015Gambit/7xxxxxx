"Pain is temporary - Glory is forever" 
Once again, Olaf Obsommer and Jens Klatt have been out in search of the ultimate Sick Line. However, this time our heroes had to learn the hard way that it is a very fine line which separates immortality from doom. But pain passes, and fame is forever. And it is not only fame and glory which drives them to push the envelope year after year. Sick Line is a philosophy! Anyone who finds their own Sick Line draws strength and energy from it, nothing more can stand in their way, come hell or high water!
