The Minority Report-(1991)
A collection of stories by-Philip K Dick

This volume covers a wide span, from late 1954 through to 1963, the years during which Dick began writing novels prolifically and his short story output lessened. The title story of this collection has been made into the Steven Spielberg-directed movie of the same name, while "The Days of Perky Pat" inspired one of Dick's greatest works, the novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch; The Penultimate Truth grew from "The Mold of Yancy". Philip K. Dick is shown at his incomparable prime in this fourth volume of the definitive collection of short fiction.

Rippers Notes
=============
I have joined together the stories that were spread across the
CDs.  During the readings, you will hear about 30 seconds of
music fade out and in.  This is where the CD breaks were.
It made logical sense to store the books this way.  If you
prefer them in CD sized rips, I believe Sciguy has ripped them
in that format.  Ask him to post them.
