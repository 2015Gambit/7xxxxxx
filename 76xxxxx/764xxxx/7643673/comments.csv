Thanks Vero for your quick uploads but its hard to watch a singing contest out of sync. "
,rok68,2012-09-17T13:22Z,"if audio is out of sync, just use VLC player to sync it...

While you're watching the video, just press the J or K keys to move the audio back or forward 50 milliseconds, respectively.

some people told me to use Ctrl+K and Ctrl+L, but that didn't work for me, J and K worked fine."
,drocket11,2012-09-17T14:06Z,thank you
,husn2503,2012-09-17T14:12Z,"keep uploading mp4 or mkv versions please 

thanks anyway"
,geoffp,2012-09-17T15:29Z,"It's not the sync problem I'm concerned about, most of Vero's recent X Factor/Xtra Factot uploads have been badly pixalated. "
,jayland,2012-09-18T02:12Z,"Thank you Rok68 for your great advice.
I will try that. However, I mostly slide all these videos onto a flash drive and plug the flash drive into my tv and then play. So, how could I control the speed during this process? anyone know>?"
,jayland,2012-09-18T02:19Z,I agree Goeffp. These episodes all seem to be very pixelated. Perhaps if VeroVenlo  could take his time uploading these precious episodes and put more care into checking to be sure the audio is in-sync.
