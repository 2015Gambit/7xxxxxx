This is a program that will let you program your hardware synths.
The synth library inside is rich so it has support for all those racks that are PITA (or impossible) to program from the front panel.

Unfortunately right now it's really impossible to obtain this software for Windows since Emagic was bought by Apple (unless you will find it and buy it secondhand) so here I'm sharing it.

This is a scene release by OxYGeN from 2005 but it wasn't properly cracked (you will need to re-authorize every 30 days) so read the included 'readme.txt'. It's nothing serious or hard - just a minor inconvenience.

Have fun!
