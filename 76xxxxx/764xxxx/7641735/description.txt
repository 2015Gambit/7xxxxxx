Peer Gynt Suites - Edvard Grieg - Full Symphony- 320 kb/s - fully tagged for mobile devices.

Well, most of the classical music fans upload FLAC files for a good reason, BUT not everybody has a fast internet connection and there are people out there who want to listen classical music on mobile devices. I have adujsted this file esp. for mobile phones (volume is adjusted and it is fully tagged). It's very good quality and there is no "clipping" - the file is relatively small, so give it a try.
If there are any problems with the file or if you are not satisfied please leave a comment, so that I can make it better next time. Thanx. 

Oh yes, PLEASE SEED !!! This classical stuff is not so popular so you got to seed !! Please seed for at least 24 hours. Thank you and greetings.
