Spoutcraft Version:

=What is spoutcraft?=
Spoutcraft is a client mod that enhances gameplay performance. You can easily customize the graphics with view distance, details, shaders etc. Spoutcraft also enables you to set up your own keybindings. Whether it be commands binded to a key, or change what buttons make you move.

If a server is using plugings that require spoutcraft (GUI plugins such as SpoutHelp, or item plugins like Guns+ or ManaBags) you must use spoutcraft to get the full potential. However, it is not required to play.
