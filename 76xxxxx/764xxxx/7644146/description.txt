┬íMayday! is an American hip hop group from Miami, Florida that consists of lyricist Bernie Garcia (aka Bernbiz or Bernz for short), lyricist Ben Miller (aka Wrekonize or Wrek for short), producer, keyboard player and guitarist Aaron Eckhart (aka Plex Luthor), percussionist Andrews Mujica (aka NonMS), drummer Terrel (aka L T Hopkins), and bassist Gianni Perocapi (aka Gianni Cash).

The band were featured in two music videos for rap superstar Lil Wayne, both videos - Da Da Da and Get a Life, were filmed on the roof of a building in the middle of the day, with spectators seemingly having a free concert below.
 
More recently, on June 3, 2011, Mayday signed with the largest independent record label of Strange Music, founded by underground legend Tech N9ne. Their newest album, Take Me to Your Leader was their first major album released under Strange Music on March 26, 2012. Their hit single off of that album with Tech already has over half a million views on Youtube within the first two months. Currently, they are conducting their largest tour in music history. 90 shows in 99 days across the US.
 
The band has held residencies at two Miami hotspots: Jazid (South Beach) and Transit Lounge (Brickell).
