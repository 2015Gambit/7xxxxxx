Product Description
San Francisco lies under a cloud of radioactive dust. People live in half-deserted apartment buildings, and 
keep electric animals as pets because so many real animals have died. Most people emigrate to Mars - unless 
they have a job to do on Earth. Like Rick Deckard - android killer for the police and owner of an electric 
sheep. This week he has to find, identify, and kill six androids which have escaped from Mars. They're 
machines, but they look and sound and think like humans - clever, dangerous humans. They will be hard to kill. 
The film Blade Runner was based on this famous novel.

From the Inside Flap
"The most consistently brilliant science fiction writer in the world."
--John Brunner
THE INSPIRATION FOR BLADERUNNER. . .
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was published in 1968. Grim and foreboding, even today it is a masterpiece 
ahead of its time.
By 2021, the World War had killed millions, driving entire species into extinction and sending mankind 
off-planet. Those who remained coveted any living creature, and for people who couldn't afford one, companies 
built incredibly realistic simulacrae: horses, birds, cats, sheep. . .
They even built humans. Emigrees to Mars received androids so sophisticated it was impossible to tell them 
from true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans could wreak, the government banned them f
rom Earth. But when androids didn't want to be identified, they just blended in.
Rick Deckard was an officially sanctioned bounty hunter whose job was to find rogue androids, and to retire 
them. But cornered, androids tended to fight back, with deadly results.
"[Dick] sees all the sparkling and terrifying possibilities. . . that other authors shy away from."
--Paul Williams



It was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill.

Somewhere among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue 
androids. Deckard's assignment--find them and then..."retire" them. 
Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't 
want to be found!

The classic novel behind the cult film classic directed by Ridley Scott. 
As atmospheric and even more compelling than the film. A dystopian tour 
de force.
