Γÿà A picture frame widget that does a google image search and displays the images it finds, instead of just showing the images on your device.

Γÿà This is the paid-for version. It has the same functionality as Superframe, but without the nag screen.

Γÿà It can also find and display pictures of your location, meaning that if you're on the move, you can set it to automatically update with relevant images.

Γÿà You can zoom and drag an image within its frame without going into an app, share it via facebook or email, change the frame color, only download images when there's wifi, and more.

Γÿà If you're stuck for inspiration, there's even a feature that suggests beautiful things to search for.

Γÿà There are four different sizes of widget, in case your version of android doesn't support widget resizing or you have Samsung Touchwiz.
