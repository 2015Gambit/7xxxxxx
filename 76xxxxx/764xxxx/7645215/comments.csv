,w4r3zh4ck,2012-09-28T22:13Z,Update your graphics driver and make sure your monitor is big enough.
,Wild_Bud,2012-10-03T22:42Z,yo if you want to change the resolution you have to change it under options before you load or start a new game. Otherwise the resolution will be grayed out and can't be changed until the next time the program is opened.
