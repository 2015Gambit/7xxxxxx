Unique torrent that I found at internet so now I going to put on PTB and keep it alive til my ratio gets 20 (from 21:00 to  8:00 o'clock UTC-03:00) .  

No other ways to have this soundtrack because neither the dear ones owners RCA / BGM France are selling this CD anymore (what shame). 

ONLY PTB CAN SAVE THE WORLD SO THANKS TO CREW, THE REAL HEROS! 


For the movie take this perfect copy:
