I'm an italian NFL fan and here we have to pay to watch the games but they air at strange hours so i would pay not being able to see them live so..thanks a lot Neptou for the last game and this.

Please keep posting Ravens games, i'm a huge fan of them!

Just a quick question(which is NOT a critic): is it me or the quality of this one is slightly worse than the last game? It's still amazing don't get me wrong, it's just something i've noticed..but i may be wrong.

Thanks again :)"
