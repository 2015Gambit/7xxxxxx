,deyyan,2012-09-17T18:49Z,Full screen not working! Why? :(
,kaise123,2012-09-18T02:30Z,"@deyyan; Go to your start menu, find 'Minecraft by Kaise123, open the 'Alternative Launcher (Fullscreen)' and that will make fullscreen work. If it does not open for you go to my forums and ask for help, or email me and I can help you out with it."
,KarathorHikari,2012-09-19T20:44Z,It works great! Thank you.
,KarathorHikari,2012-09-20T09:07Z,"I tried going into multiplayer, and it seemed to work fine, but it wouldn't let me talk and kept telling me to register."
,kaise123,2012-09-21T02:56Z,"@KarathorHikari; Most offline servers require you to register so that other players cannot log into your account using your name. To register, You just need to type '/register  ' without the quotations and the ''s. If you need any help go on my forums and post a topic and I'll make a detailed reply on how to do it"
,kaise123,2012-09-21T02:58Z,"@KarathorHikari; For some reason TPB removed part of the command. Here is what you type (Replace PASSWORD with a password of your own choice, you require it to log back into the server whenever you reply)

/register PASSWORD PASSWORDAGAIN"
,KarathorHikari,2012-09-21T07:48Z,I'll give that a try. Thanks for your help.

,lolipopus,2012-10-01T01:54Z,"A question kaise, sometimes when i play the whole world kinda flimmers and become transparent so i can see like caves and stuff. It's quite annoying.

I'm running on the modded version.. is this caused because of some mod?"
,lolipopus,2012-10-01T02:00Z,"I think i found the cause, it's the Multi-core chunk loading. When i had it on ""Multi Core"" the flimmer starts and when i switched it off it stopped, the ""Smooth"" option seem okay tho."
