This activator is a 'Frankenbuild' Loader, meaning it swaps out files in order to activate.

- Activate any edition (without reducing default activation abilities)
- Trial Reset (get back 4 rearms and 30 days)

Installs/Uninstalls/Detects public SLIC emulators:

- W7 Loader
- Open W7 Loader
- SLIC Driver
- Vista Boot
- WOW7 Loader
- MBR SLIC Loader
- Vista Loader


It does work and will activate all Win 7 editions.

Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition 3 uses retail MSDN keys, this is misleading as it combines them with certs in the UI, making it look like an OEM key.
When the keys reach their maximum activation limit or Microsoft blocks them, this will become useless, unless Napalum has an unlimited supply of MSDN keys.

Back up your tokens.dat file if you must have a version other than Ultimate.
