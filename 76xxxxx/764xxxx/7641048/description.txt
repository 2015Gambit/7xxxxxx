
Pink - The Truth About Love (Deluxe)

Deluxe digipak version with 3 extra tracks

Having taken time out of the limelight to start a family, P!nk (aka Alicia Moore) is back with her brand new album 'The Truth About Love'! The song's infectious melodies and kick-ass lyrics have let the world know that P!nk is back and at her absolute best!
P!nk has teamed up with producer Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foster The People & The Shins) for the very first time on this release along with long time collaborators Max Martin and Shellback, Billy Mann and Butch Walker. She has also worked with songwriter/producer Dan Wilson (Adele's Someone Like You). The album is P!nk's unique take on the different shades of love - the dark, the light, the happy and the sad.
