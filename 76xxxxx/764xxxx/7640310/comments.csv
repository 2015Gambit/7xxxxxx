dd you have to update your xbox 360? it wont let play the game unless i update? but if i update will it reflash my xbox??

i dont want to play online, just by myself? is there anyway to play the game without doing the system update?? thanksss"
,dudelove420,2012-09-24T05:45Z,"Yeah, when you update it works. My console was banned now it isn't because it has the latest update. It's telling me I am good for gold and all of that and is not giving me the online error messages it was giving me previously. Thanks etgamez and yes, if you have the latest dashboard with LT 3.0 Firmware you do not need to worry when updating I think. I'm kind of new at this, but I learned a lot already."

how did you manage to burn the disc to a dvd rdl?? coz the discs are 8.5gb and the game was like 8.7 so its too big, thats what imgburn keeps telling me! any tips?"
,dudelove420,2012-09-30T09:44Z,"You have 2 options: 1) to overburn without a ihas and just a standard dl burner leaving out a little bit of space in which case you shouldn't play online and some games will still get errors every now and then, to overburn when it asks for trunicate and overburn just choose overburn and it will pop up with a message saying file size is to big, forget that by clicking yes, at the end of the burn an error message will appear, click cancel and then click to close the track and finish the burn session, you should have 97% of, 2) the other way is  to go out and purchase a Ihas burner and flash it with burner max and then you can convert 100 % of the files that you download that have bigger image file then dvd size and you are pretty much safe to play online then.
