[T],trialNerror,2012-09-18T07:38Z,"i can't believe people actually like this show. yuck. but good on ya for bringing it to the small crowd of likers.

anyway, i saw you trying to brag about you doing more shows than me.  that's cool you think that, but truth is i probably do 2, 3, sometimes up to 5 shows every night, just under a different name. i do a lot more shows than just paranormal, but only release the paranormal as tNe. hell i have probably 6 recordings that i need to process and release. even when the release wasn't ""tNe"" you have still converted my work to this xvid stuff.

soooooo..... yea.  you don't know what all i do. and what i do is original releases while you're still just a re-encoder; you have nothing without the work of real cappers.

but go on n brag about number of releases, that's fine, there's a few that know the truth and maybe one day i'll fill you in, too.  ;)"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-18T07:40Z,"heh right now i'm working on my 4th release for the day, but you won't see them under trialnerror or have tNe at the end."
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T07:45Z,"dont know what your on about TNE

you sure it was me?

I dont brag

ive always said I find many missed and rare shows espc in the paranormal from other countries other then USA
if thats bragging then so be it?

this show is actually good.. shes funny and loud
with it.. 

and some of her readings seem geniune.. I dont see how a strangers details could be known unless its setup she just comes out with too
many weird personal things.. before she cold reads with does that make sense comments :)

but cheaters always get found out in the end"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-18T10:17Z,"@tNe I think you might be wrong on that.call me a try-hard but I checked pss's torrents going back about 5 pages & I don't see any bragging about content or amount of it.I know the way you act on here enough to know you woulda jumped on bitching about it alot sooner if it was any further back than that so I didn't bother going back any more.maybe you saw some one else say that & you think its pss using another name (& out of fairness it very well could be for all I know)or maybe it was in a comment on Kat or ET or a forum somewhere.or maybe your having one of your bi-polar emo fits again...you can't spout out something like that without explaining its source.and as far as re-encoding goes thats pretty much what you do.you record some one else's work,change it to a format you prefer,upload it to the interwebs & call it yours.so quit your bitchin & deal with the fact that the world isn't the way you want it to be....welcome to life kid"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T10:25Z,":O I thought the comment is way out left field too
i certainly havent said anything about you for a while now and I reply to stuff normally when someone has a go at me "
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T10:30Z,"it might not be TNE though hes given out his id and password here for friends.. I think maybe some confusion about when I got vip and it was cos mods thought I uploaded 5 to 10 xvids a day for the excluded xvid lovers and also mods thought I filled in the hole of missing content here /episodes scene missed or p2pmules missed to upload here


I see MrJoshGates is back with new ID like Zacbagas and back to trying to stirred things again.. perhaps its him using tnes acct 

either way Im way passed this non sense of bittering here.... and Im cutting back shares here as you might of noticed since torrent sites under attack lately and of course data caps of isp"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T10:31Z,:o darn comments wont show again LOL oh well
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T10:43Z,"and again both are attacking me in the other torrent ghost stories s02

leave it out.. we had enough of it already here
and the mods will delete people

for fook sake.. you change like the wind one day your normal and other days you psycho

I dont have to leave tags in the names if I convert them.. I dont have to say thanks for or add source brags in descriptions (even if I do it most of the time) all thats just plain crazy stuff

and know mp4 and mkv is better thats why media coys are targetting torrent sites more cos its all HD now competing with their blu ray sales

I dont need HD i dont need 1gb files etc etc etc"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-18T11:25Z,"well,he did say he up'd under another name so who knows man.what I do know is no matter what name its under he does good work.but I think in real life he's an un-liked person in some way...maybe a highschool kid with no friends or he has a bad home life of some sort.he could be a weak person in an aggresive place,who knows.& I know your gonna see this tNe so I don't want you to think I'm downing you,I'm just calling it the way I see it & I've seen it quite a bit where I'm from"
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T07:07Z,"hes pm-ed at Kat going on about giving credit and being a bad pirate.

those darn rogue pirates huh

so it was him.. so sad.. thought he grown up a bit but guess not

hes defending his friend

frankly I dont see any other sources here so if people want credit on p2p they best to upload their own shit so others dont have to

as I told him not all sources have tags some are streamed even and p2p is about sharing not
getting credit for ripping and stuff

if I wanted that i have psspsp tag on my names as well..

Im not part of a scene group and wouldnt want to be

I dont my own thing and do it my way people can choose whom they want to grab from or follow

else it would be called a scene dictatorship"
,tibird,2012-09-20T20:01Z,I dont care for this show either but I respect that some people like it and want to help keep it going for those who do like it. you provide good shows that others dont so bravo. dont worry about the haters you cant please everybody but you can please yourself. I hope you dont stop doing this on account of a couple idiot haters.
