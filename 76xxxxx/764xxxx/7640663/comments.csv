That would require some serious amount of time, I might do it at some point but no guarantees."

NYT's 100 bestselling books of 2011??

Are you kidding?

Will you be able to finish reading them?

@ azizex666

You can ignore gdbala's request. It is very unlikely that they will be able to finish reading all the 100 books."

Not all publishers will publish their books as ebooks, meaning it will be impossible to upload NYT's 100 bestselling novels even if the OP wanted to."
