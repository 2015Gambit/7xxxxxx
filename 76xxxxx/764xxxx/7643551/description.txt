Book Description
================
In The Divine Invasion, Philip K. Dick asks: What if God--or a being 
called Yah--were alive and in exile on a distant planet? How could a 
second coming succeed against the high technology and finely tuned rationalized 
evil of the modern police state? The Divine Invasion "blends Judaism, 
Kabalah, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity into a fascinating fable of 
human existence" (West Coast Revew of Books).
From the Back Cover
God is not dead, he has merely been exiled to an extraterrestrial planet. 
And it is on this planet that God meets Herb Asher and convinces him 
to help retake Earth from the demonic Belial. Featuring virtual reality, 
parallel worlds, and interstellar travel, The Divine Invasion blends 
philosophy and adventure in a way few authors can achieve.

As the middle novel of DickΓÇÖs VALIS trilogy, The Divine Invasion plays 
a pivotal role in answering the questions raised by the first novel, 
expanding that world while exploring just how much anyone can really 
knowΓÇöeven God himself.


Poster's Note: I'll try to find and post the other Valis books, unless 
someone beats me to it.
