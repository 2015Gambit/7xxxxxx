Pierre Rivière murdered his mother, sister and brother in an attempt to free his father from a life of drudgery brought on by her wilfulness and profligacy. The film is powerful because Allio chooses to show the crime from different perspectives as well as calling on the astonishing testimony of Pierre Rivière himself, which he wrote in prison and from a narrative that examines the historical milieu in which the action was set and our notions of what truth is.

This film is gripping because the cast inhabit their roles with such conviction and because it is both a portrait of a psychopathic killing and its aftermath and a truly accurate historical reconstruction. The film also makes much of the fact that this case was historically unique because it was the first to allow psychiatric testimony to be used.
