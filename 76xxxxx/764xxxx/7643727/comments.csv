It's said she was hanged after trying to help her lover escape the stockades and now she forever haunts the islands.

I've camped on and driving by at night numerous times and on a couple of occasions was spooked by mysterious lights myself~Not sure if it's the same Georges Island or inspired from it at all.

Edgar Allen Poe was stationed in these islands during the wars of the times.  He has said to been inspired from these catacombs and those on the nearby Castle Island also.

Nearby Long Island is the setting for the Movie Shutter Island, in general it's a very spooky place to be, especially in bad weather!
