TPB is a great source for video but without your contribution the e library what be slim pickens.  I have been looking for Stephan Ambrose but not having much luck, maybe you could help. Thanks much."

Did you mean Stephen E. Ambrose?"
,Bmack7263,2012-09-20T03:28Z,"Sorry, I cop to lazy and bad speller. Yes I did mean Stephen E. Ambrose. He wrote one about the trans continental railroad that I would like to find. Also looking for anything and everything by Arianna Franklin and Mel Starr. Keep up the good work. Just curious are you a reader or a collector or just like sharing the data?"
