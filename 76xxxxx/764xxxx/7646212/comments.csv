HDTS is a Telesync done with a High Definition camera.

That doesn't mean the movie will come out in high definition like a blue-ray, it's only a high quality cam.

UltraTorrents is not lying. tflagger997, you just didn't know the meaning of the term HDTS. It's easy to jump to conclusions thou when you see HD in the title.  "
