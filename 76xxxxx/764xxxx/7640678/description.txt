Gary Lineker presents highlights from all of Saturday's Premier League matches. Champions Manchester City meet Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, which was the scene of a Peter Crouch wonder strike when then teams drew there last season. Manchester United entertain Wigan, while Fulham manager Martin Jol sees his team play West Brom, a club he represented in his playing career.

Arsenal play host to Southampton, hoping to score their first league goals of the season at the Emirates after being held 0-0 there by Sunderland on the opening day. Other fixtures include a west London derby, with QPR also looking to banish memories of their most recent league game at Loftus Road, a 5-0 thumping by Swansea - but Mark Hughes' side face a tough task, with European champions Chelsea the visitors.

Elsewhere, Liverpool travel to Sunderland, Norwich host West Ham and Swansea visit Aston Villa.
