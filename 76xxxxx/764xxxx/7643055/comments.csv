,cybergodsig,2012-09-18T17:30Z,"The vinyl is a 16 bit digital transfer, so this version is as good as it gets."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-18T21:11Z,"I like to run and ride my bike and you can't yet put a 24bit 96khz vinyl on a portable media player yet.  I have the sansa clip zip and its perfect for flac, thats why I get the best digital versions.  many people don't realize that a lot of vinyls are cd digital tranfers to vinyl.  Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Primus are prime examples."
