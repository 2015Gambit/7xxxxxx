And it even has all the underscore fights and everything, couldn't be more pleased, many thanks to the uploader, if I had one complaint it's that you could have uploaded it a little sooner, but it's still perfect."
,thunderlungz425,2012-09-17T00:19Z,"I take my comment back, the quality is great, but there's a few issues with it, black screen for a few seconds in some spots and shit."
