Around The World In 80 Gardens 
Around the World in 80 Gardens is a BBC series that follows broadcaster Monty Don as he travels all over the planet searching for world-class gardens - ancient and modern, large and small, grand and humble. In total, exactly eighty gardens are featured during his 10 journeys, and include the Alhambra, the gardens of the Taj Mahal in India, the gardens of the Villa D'Este in Italy and many important botanic and royal gardens from Thailand to Bali, from New Zealand to Europe and from China to Mexico.




2)  Australia and New Zealand 
This week he travels to Australia and New Zealand, two of the youngest gardening cultures in the world. But it is not just about dreamy climates and wonderful plants. Monty sets out from the aptly named Botany Bay to uncover a story of culture clash and plant invasion, where the gentle habits of the indigenous people and the extraordinary natural landscapes have been dashed aside in favour of imported plants and a surprisingly English style of garden. By the time he finds his feet in New Zealand he's soon gasping for native plants and sets off in search of the wild heart of New Zealand, where he revels in a magical rainforest garden created entirely of native plants.

Due to the 1st part 2 of Australia and New Zealand being jerky i have re- encoded it


garden a construct?
