,madlax10,2012-09-18T20:18Z,"Works.  Still not getting any NPC voices...  But that is an issue with the game release, not the crack.  Download the Skidrow release and you'll be fine.  The Steam releases are the issue."
,Food2doog,2012-09-18T20:35Z,this crack working?
,Jet-Five-,2012-09-19T00:40Z,hey this is skidrows cousin skidtoe... I am sick and tired of people talkin' shit. I'm a gangsta and I pirate shit and I'm popular and my dick is 12 inches long.. fuk wit me and your gunna get dealt with..

,Djghost13,2012-09-19T01:47Z,"lol jet, are you brain damaged?"
,Hypersync,2012-09-19T02:02Z,Can I play online after I install this patch? 
,royalcola,2012-09-19T02:43Z,@Hypersync The fuck makes you think you'll ever play this online without buying it? It's a Steamworks game; you'll only be playing this offline unless you shell out a ridiculous $60.
,Milosz006,2012-09-19T04:04Z,"@royalcola: the original Borderlands could be played with people who bought the game, even with a cracked copy."
,sanitysama,2012-09-19T18:24Z,"piss poor shitrow release as usual. no i won't ""block it in my firewall"". that isn't how cracks work. lazy pieces of shit."

,g2thebeast,2012-09-21T04:07Z,can someone tell me how to put the files in?
,br1ng1t0nh0,2012-09-22T09:03Z,"This looks suspicious, to say the least hmm"
,RaW-D-Coy,2012-09-22T12:56Z,3dm worked for me no need for this one if u're not having any more problems after 3dm crack =3 now when are the dlc's coming out so i can apply them =?
,ddashh,2012-09-24T15:13Z,"Nice work once more Skidrow, thanks for sharing. If you are having trouble with getting the install to play- YOU MUST HAVE STEAM INSTALLED. You don't need to run it though. Thanks again, free stuff rocks, huh?;-)"
,VegitoDBZ,2012-09-25T18:58Z,"sanitisama, then go buy a game, you lazy piece of shit. You want everything done for you >_>"
,MossyAces,2012-09-26T20:50Z,"I cant get it to work, i am missing a file called XINPUT3.dll Or something like that"
