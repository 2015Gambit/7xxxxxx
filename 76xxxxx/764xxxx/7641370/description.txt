Nick Waterhouse

Waterhouse, whose retro vocal style and stylized look has been compared to original rockers Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly as well as neo-soulsters Mark Ronson, Mayer Hawthorne, Amy Winehouse, Charles Bradley, Allen Stone and Sharon Jones, was pumped to be part of Live from DarylΓÇÖs House. ΓÇ£Playing and hanging out with Daryl was simultaneously beyond belief and totally naturalΓÇª just playing music. Any nerves I had went out the door eight bars in when I saw that we were all in the same pocket.ΓÇ¥

He also added: ΓÇ£DarylΓÇÖs a real soulful, smart cat, and was totally open and warm as a host. The man, the band, and his whole family really showed me a great time, something I will remember for days and years to come.ΓÇ¥

For Nick Waterhouse, it all began with a single vinyl 45, ΓÇ£Some Place,ΓÇ¥ which he recorded with ΓÇ£a band of twenty something kidsΓÇ¥ and sax player Ira Raibon, a veteran of some of the same bands which produced the kind of lost classics that the singer-songwriter attempted to emulate. The release sold out shortly after it was released, and now changes hands for upwards of $300 on eBay for the rare copy. A fan of ΓÇ£vintage, over-modulated R&BΓÇªa time-honored tradition that evokes the back-alley thrill of New Orleans, Detroit and Memphis in their heyday,ΓÇ¥ Waterhouse recorded on magnetic tape direct to mono on the same Gold Star Studios lathe once used by Phil Spector and the Beach Boys. ΓÇ£The important thing to me was I did everything myself,ΓÇ¥ he says. ΓÇ£On my own termsΓÇöthe way I wanted.ΓÇ¥ The subject of a June GQ profile and photo spread, Waterhouse begins a tour Sept. 26 in Denver , CO , which runs through Oct. 21 in L.A. at the El Rey Theatre.

Daryl found he had a lot in common with his LFDH guest. "We really bonded over our love of vintage R&B and soul. NickΓÇÖs a real scholar of this music, and it turned out to be a great match.ΓÇ¥
