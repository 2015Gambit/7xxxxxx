,MB20,2012-09-21T14:16Z,Thank you so much! :)
,maskid,2012-09-22T12:46Z,on rutracker already have full show of Matchbox Twenty in 1080p
,MB20,2012-09-22T13:50Z,@maskid Thank you for sharing that info! :)
,iG2012,2012-09-26T14:41Z,"Great stuff, thanks for this. Any chance you could record any of the following:
Labrinth, Example, Mumford and Sons, Ed Sheeran, Plan B & Biffy Clyro - or share what I'd need to do it myself ;)"
,nate_drake,2012-09-27T05:01Z,"@iG2012: I already have Mumford's and Biffy's ready, will start seeding soon. The others will do if I can."
,lordclarkson,2012-09-30T23:46Z,"Any chance of MUSE, once/if their show goes up?"
,nate_drake,2012-10-01T03:20Z,@lordclarkson Check back later on ;)
,lordclarkson,2012-10-01T08:29Z,"Woohoo! I watched it through iTunes, but my internet kept crapping out so I missed bits :("
,BradKtulu,2012-10-04T03:45Z,"Thanks for the upload!

Will you be getting the Mumford & Sons performance up soon?"
,nate_drake,2012-10-04T05:27Z,"@BradKtulu I already have all performances I wanted, but will upload slowly since my upload speed is not that great and I don't want some serious bottleneck."
,nate_drake,2012-10-04T05:28Z,"Sorry all for misinformation, for some reason I didn't think and put 1080p but this is actually 720p, and that is the max available resolution of the show as streamed by Apple."
