[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

You've heard Obama's and Romney's pitches.

"We're moving America forward!"

"We did build that!"

I'm tired of hearing from just them.

(The Romney and Obama impersonators pictured above are Mike Cote and Maxwell Price from Politicos Comedy)

There are other voices we don't hear, because the media rarely covers them.

Declaration of Independents author Matt Welch and Theresa Amato, who wrote Grand Illusion: The Myth of Voter Choice in a Two-Party Tyranny, argue that we should pay more attention to third parties and their candidates.

Then we're joined by three of them:

Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson: "Free markets and limited government are the foundation of prosperity."

Stewart Alexander from Socialist Party USA: "We support the needs of the working class people... make sure we don't have disparity in income between the rich and the poor."

Virgil Goode of the Constitution Party: "We support limited government as outlined in the Constitution."

The three candidates will state their case and question each other. I won't let the two guys pictured enough talk, because it's time we hear from the "others."

I say: One of them would be a better president than Obama or Romney.
