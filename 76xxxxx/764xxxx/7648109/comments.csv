,ThatTunechi,2012-09-18T10:53Z,thats what i said and he said its fine.plz fix this issue  if u can.thanks
,SCSA420,2012-09-18T13:00Z,"OK I will tell you what I'm have done here I have adjusted the color saturation on my HD capture card from the default setting of 115 down to 85 which is a difference of 30 and my last 3 720p releases of Friday Night Smackdown , Saturday Morning Slam and this episode of Raw have been captured using the above reduced color setting however the video looks perfectly fine here on my brand new 55 inch LG 3D LED Smart HDTV, my Core I7 2700k Sandy Bridge cpu desktop PC running a Nvidia GTX 680, my Core I5 Ivy Bridge  3427U cpu Laptop PC, and my Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. The only thing I can say is it must be your equipment maybe you should try adjusting the color level on your TV or PC monitor I cannot find anything wrong here with the color at all. Are you guys aware that new 3D LED HDTV's and BluRay 720p and 1080p HD video has much more vivid colors then older TV's and dvd quality video does? My captures are done using a Monster Cable Version 1.4 HDMI cable from my DirecTv equipment to my capture card which is the best quality cable you can get."
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-18T14:34Z,its only ur vids that r like that 4 me.i know its not my tv or my laptop cuz it looks the same on both.i still download ur wwe/tna cuz i love the quality even though the color is weird.i even played it on my bros 52 inch 3d smart tv and its still the same.like i said its just ur uploads that look like that 4 me.its kinda hard 4 u 2 fix it cuz u say it looks fine for u but most of us it doesnt.all 3 of the screens i tested the vid on look the same so i dont think its me.if any1 else has this problem plz comment 2 let him know so he knows its just not us 3 that can see it

,shaban96,2012-09-18T16:50Z,"ok a couple of things.

even i have a super LED sony bravia 55 inch 3D

I also get the live feed of raw. the color is perfect on the usa network & sky sports.

only ur uploads the colour is a bit too much than required.

P.S. its not called Supershow anymore since the 1000th raw.

if u wanna see how the real colour should look like try dling other guys who upload raw"
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-18T21:57Z,see SCSA420 its not just me.we do really thank u for ur uploads cuz there good just this 1 fix will make urs the best out of all the wwe/tna uploaders.
,PAuLo96,2012-09-19T01:24Z,yep the color is kinda bit too much compared to others but still your uploads are still the best when it comes to quality.
,shaban96,2012-09-19T22:20Z,"without a doubt we are thankful for ur dedication & i know how much effort is required to upload something like this.

If I may advise you.

the color is a bit too much. secondly i think all WWE shows are broadcasted in 50 frames not 60

correct me if im wrong.

lastly u really need to crank up ur upload speed it takes almost half a day just to completely dl ur shows"
,bbcown,2012-09-20T03:29Z,"To everyone complaining about the color, are you guys aware that the middle rope is SUPPOSED to be pink..?"
,SCSA420,2012-09-20T03:41Z,"All the WWE HD and TNA HD programming is broadcasted in 1920x1080i on USA, SyFy, and SpikeTv channels on DirecTv. I have the option to record either in 1080i or 720p from my DirecTv equipment using my capture card here which I usually record at 1080i then convert to 720p when I edit out the commercials before I actually upload the shows here. As far as uploading faster goes I can only upload as fast as my connections will allow me to do. I have access to 2 broadband connnections here DSL and cable internet so when I upload and seed I'm usually always seeding from 2 PC's and 2 connections at the same time. I wish I could get a faster internet connection like Verizon FiOS here but it isn't available in my area yet so I can only get what is available here currently. I do the best I can with what I have here. I have completely checked and rechecked all the settings on my HDTV and satellite equipment and my HD capture card here and the video looks fine here on my equipment and the color is perfectly fine here, so I don't know what to say at this point. I even have a friend of mine who is a professional broadcast engineer at a CBS HDTV station says there is nothing wrong with my captures and he would know better then I do as he is the one who helped me get the proper equipment setup here to do the shows I do. He also says that in the USA where I live 1280x720p High Definition and 1920x1080i High Definition are broadcast at 59.940 - 60 frames per second which is the ATSC standard. 29.976 - 30 frames per second is the NTSC Standard Definition television. 25 and 50 frames per second is PAL Standard Definition and DVB High Definition standard in Europe. I hope that explains it for you. "
,shaban96,2012-09-20T07:01Z,"would u possibly consider to just try to lower the color saturation by 15 points?

we will give u instant feedback if its ok or not"
