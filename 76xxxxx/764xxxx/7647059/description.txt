QG 62 - Gravitational Matter

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Building on the definitions of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter as provided by Tetryonic Quantum Mechanics, a formal definition of a quantum of Gravitational Matter and its Gravito-Electro-Magnetic [GEM] interactions is developed 

The sixty-second chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
