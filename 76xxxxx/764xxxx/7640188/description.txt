Cowboys & Indian are a balls to the wall 3 piece rockabilly band from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  They are currently working on original material, but took a break to record some of their favorite songs at Hot Damn Records, an Albuquerque based analog recording studio.

As a bonus for audiophiles, the uncut recording sessions are also included, that means you get all the outtakes, bitching and moaning, and fuck-ups.
