,gabriel1475,2012-09-18T18:58Z,"If what was said two posts ago is true, this uploader is an ignorant idiot lying asshole of the worst kind.

Im going to get this file. If its really just another TS uploaded by dick-smoking LIARS, I'll come back here to warn everyone.  Gimme a few hours and check back."
,gabriel1475,2012-09-18T19:27Z,"Ok, got it.

LIES LIES LIES!

This is nothing more then another TS with bad sound, uploaded by no-integrity pathetic losers! Its not even close to HD. Its been converted to 1280x544, but it sure as shit didnt start out at that resolution.

Why do assholes do things like this?

If you absolutely cant wait a short while longer, and are ok with watching a shitty TS copy, then by all means. Have at it.

Dishonesty is a sign of weak character. "
,gabriel1475,2012-09-18T19:32Z,"LIES LIES LIES!
I went ahead and got it, and its just another crappy TS. Why do pathetic fools lie about these things?
Bad karma, losers."
,DownSpace,2012-09-18T19:43Z,"Please look at the screenshot before download, and I never said this one is HD or BRRIP version, just another rip version with 720p solution. Thanks!"
