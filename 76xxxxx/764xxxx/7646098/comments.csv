,Q__boii,2012-09-20T13:41Z,"Crack doesn't work. Installation works fine, but the program icon just says ""Please insert CD, click OK and restart application. While copying ""speed.exe"" nothing happens, the Most Wanted folder doesn't even contain a file called ""speed"". 
While replacing the ""nfsMW.exe"" with ""speed.exe"" and renaming it to ""nfsMW.exe"", I still get the same problem. I'll try out a no-CD crack or something like that."

Make sure you delete the old Speed.exe"
