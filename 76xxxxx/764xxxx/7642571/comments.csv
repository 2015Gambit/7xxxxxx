,gangman57445,2012-09-16T23:25Z,its only multiplayer
,Psychozoa,2012-09-16T23:56Z,"OP didn't specify this, so please read.

THIS IS LEGIT, however you CANNOT play it at this time! This is ONLY a menu! You can access options, but you cannot get passed a login screen on the ""Xbox Live"" selection!

You NEED a RGH, JTAG, or DevKit system! Retail/xKey/Flashed systems don't work!

If you are aware that this is ONLY a menu, then go ahead and download it. However don't expect to be able to play anything. System link and split screen are not options."
,gangman57445,2012-09-17T00:31Z,unless you have a online jtag/rgh
,XeLiveBypass,2012-09-17T01:35Z,"Psychozoa, you're so wrong. You can play online? Look, I've been on for hours now with a few mates... http://imgur.com/a/qY1nJ#0"
,gangman57445,2012-09-17T04:13Z,everyone is leeching this and not giving credit
,boyznacne,2012-09-17T05:52Z,"Yep its JTAG/RGH only.

Look at the files, there is a BlackOps2.xex file in order to launch the game either through FSD, XeXMenus, XexLoader, etc."
,neCso_23,2012-09-17T07:06Z,"Hey, guys. I don't have a JTAG, so  cannot check this out. I really want to learn something about split-screen options, so it would be great if someone write down all options in split-screen available. I mean, is there leveling up, bots and etc. Please."
,trust187,2012-09-17T12:02Z,"doesnt work, just freezes .

,AXSC,2012-09-17T16:01Z,"@trust187

I'm not 100% sure but open up XeX menu and put the file (BO2) on a flash drive. From there, go to your flash drive and start the .xex"
,trust187,2012-09-18T00:11Z,Thanks mate il give it a shot and see what happens
,trust187,2012-09-18T00:36Z,"nahh didnt work guys, i dont even get the esrg warning at the start. it goes straight to the menu and if i click into anything. it freezes staight away. "
,dog10dog,2012-09-19T02:12Z,To everyone that it won't work for. Unload dash launch and relaunch the black ops 2 and it will load. 
,trust187,2012-09-19T07:42Z,How do u unload dash launch ? 
,yowis97,2012-09-30T22:31Z,anyone want to share the files to get jtags online :3 i wont share it with anyone
