Aikido is a traditional Japanese martial art with roots in the samurai era. It is definitely an art in every sense of the word. Its dedication to harmony and natural, fluid movements lend the art a genuinely beautiful, flowing aesthetic. On the other side, Aikido is also a very practical system of self defense that does not require much strength in application.
