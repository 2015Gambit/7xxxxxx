Don't they teach Torrents and Piracy in Greek school? 8)"

Im always at 100kb/s up max. and then down speed Unlimited.  It will balance out in a few minutes."
,Leopardi,2012-09-21T19:47Z,Freezes on PS3; LG usb tv doesnt accept the file; COMPLETE SHITE TORRENT. Learn to make compatible files.
,t_amante,2012-09-28T21:32Z,"""Lower quality, please"". Never thought I would see this kind of request.

@Leopardi: Watched it on PS3. Perfect. Watched it on Samsung usb TV. Perfect. Complete SHITE comment. Learn to buy better TV's, clean you PS3 (soon it will have YLOD) and be polite."
