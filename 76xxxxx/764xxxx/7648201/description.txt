The Secret Race is a definitive look at the world of professional cyclingΓÇöand the doping issue surrounding this sport and its most iconic rider, Lance ArmstrongΓÇöby former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle.
 
Over the course of two years, Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke candidly with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anythingΓÇöand take any risk, physical, mental, or moralΓÇöto gain the edge they need to win.
 
Tyler Hamilton was once one of the worldΓÇÖs best-liked and top-ranked cyclistsΓÇöa fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stagesΓÇöand grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance ArmstrongΓÇÖs most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of ArmstrongΓÇÖs record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by ArmstrongΓÇÖs side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacleΓÇöwinning the gold medal at the 2004 OlympicsΓÇöhis career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.
