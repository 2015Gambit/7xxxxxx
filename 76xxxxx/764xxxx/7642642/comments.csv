,yellrebel,2012-09-23T12:21Z,I've deleted any trace of the original Titanium Backup and the data from trying to patch it with lucky patcher and it tells me I don't have enough space yet I have 40+MB free internal and 1GBfree on my SD

i had the same probl 
you have to go to data/app with root explorer and remove any trace of titanium 
i found this file com.keramidis.titanium......
if you cant delete it just open luckypatcher and will remove the file itself
it worked for me 
and titanium is cracked and ready to go
