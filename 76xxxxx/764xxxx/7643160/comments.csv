And the windows loader is it placed on dvd ?

Tanks alot."
,gonz621,2012-09-18T05:04Z,.net 3.5 and .net 4 included in this one?
[V],Maherz,2012-09-18T19:47Z,"@tomkar789
It's English, but you can install any display language you want from Windows Update.
The Loader isn't in the DVD, it's alone beside the ISO file.

@gonz621
The original one from Microsoft for Windows 7 SP1 which is .NET 3.5"

,Heartofthorns,2012-09-22T12:16Z,"@ afhamhilman
You can update to .NET 4.0
Did mine using Windows update.

@ simer_cool
As long as you used a Daz loader to activate, I'm sure you can update using Windows update.
Not sure of other methods. Hopefully Maherz can give more info if you need so.

@ shilohhaika 
If you do a CLEAN install, yes they will get deleted. Backup any data you need. If you have different partitions, you can save them on another partition and format just the Windows drive, (Mostly C: drive) Again, if you need more info, Maherz can provide it."
,kieran2793,2012-09-22T21:31Z,whats the difference between this windows dwnload and the 86 dwnload underneath this torrent on the search page. 
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-23T01:48Z,"@ kieran2793
This one is the 64-bit Windows 7.
The torrent below this (x86) is the 32-bit Windows 7.
Google has many links if you want to know the difference between the two. Here's the microsoft link explaining the difference. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions"
,Volkan-K,2012-09-23T02:57Z,"ive read that if we install update KB971033 then windows will be unregistered, is this true? what can you tell us about KB971033?"
,dperdure,2012-09-23T08:37Z,Thanks a lot Maherz ur uploads r jus 'perfect' ! No other word.
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-23T13:21Z,"@ Volkan-K
Use the Daz loader (it's in Maherz's torrents) and you should be fine. Read the description in the Daz loader, it fools the system into thinking it's genuine. Thus if you use that, you should have no trouble. 
Used it myself and checked for the genuine thingy on microsoft website, and it said it was genuine. So KB971033 shouldn't affect anything even if you install it. And just in case you're paranoid, don't install that update from Windows Update. In case you have installed it, just google for ways to uninstall it, there's plenty of links.
But like I said, use Daz loader and you should be fine."
,streetraceros,2012-09-23T14:25Z,"tnx for the upload.
can you make both x86 and x64 versions integrated into one disc?"
[V],Maherz,2012-09-23T20:09Z,"@afhamhilman
Turn on automatic updates and update .net framework ;)

@simer_cool
Yes, you can safely turn automatic updates on after using Windows Loader to activate.

@shilohhaika
If you do a clean install they will get deleted.

@Heartofthorns
Thank you :)

@kieran2793
@Volkan-K
I have nothing to add to what Heartofthorns said.

@streetraceros
I don't really have much time to do so. Sorry.."

,kirbyofdeath,2012-09-25T21:05Z,Can you use a Iso program to just run the iso? or can u put this on a USB. Cuz i dont have a CD at the moment
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-25T23:25Z,"@ kirbyofdeath
1. A CD would be insufficient as the file is 3.68GB. You would need a DVD at the least.
2. (i) You can install it using a USB. However, you will have to turn the USB into a bootable device.
Just search google for ""How to install Windows 7 using USB"". There's plenty of links which should help.
OR
     (ii) Use WinToFlash software to install Windows 7 on the USB. Here's the link to the website  http://www.wintoflash.com/  There is a video tutorial on the website itself on how to install Windows on the USB. You can then use the USB to install Windows 7 on any computer. 

You might have to set the Boot Device Priority in the BIOS to Removable Drive/USB Drive so that it boots from the USB.
Hope that helped."
,kirbyofdeath,2012-09-26T06:50Z,@Heartofthorns Yes that did help thank you. I just used the windows tool on the windows website. It is putting it on the USB now. Lets hope it works. Also i have currently a 32 bit version of windows but i have 8gb of ram so i need to get a 64 bit version which is why im am downloading this. If i just did Upgrade would that work?
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-26T18:20Z,"@ kirbyofdeath
No, you can't click on upgrade to upgrade from 32 bit to 64 bit. You will have to do a clean install.
I read a post on google some time back where a guy asked if he installed 32-bit windows twice, would that make it 64-bit. No, you cannot xD. Well, back to topic.

You have 8GB Ram, so ofcourse 64-bit is better. However, you will first have to make sure your hardware supports 64-bit. This is the microsoft's link  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions  Check the section, ""How do I tell if my computer can run a 64-bit version of Windows? "" By the way, most new processors support 64-bit.
Hope that helped."
,afhamhilman,2012-09-26T19:52Z,"for this version, can i install microsoft security essentials? i mean will somehow they detect the windows is not genuine?"
,Tysaunis,2012-09-26T22:20Z,Can i use this on a disk for a new computer build?
,ChiefChilly,2012-09-27T03:28Z,"I get an error when I put the disk in, it says it's not bootable. Could someone walk me through this, if you would be so kind?"
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-27T05:30Z,"@ afhamhilman
This copy is not activated. You will have to use Daz's loader to activate it. It's in Maherz's torrent list. The loader fools the system into thinking it's genuine, so yes you can use Microsoft Security Essentials after that without problems.

@ Tysaunis 
Yes you can.

@ ChiefChilly
1. If you're using ImgBurn to burn the DVD, 
   (i) Open ImgBurn
   (ii) Click on ""Write image file to disc""
   (iii) Select the source where you have downloaded the .iso file (In short select the place where you have downloaded the file)
   (iv) Click on Write (the big icon at bottom)
OR 
2. If you're using Nero Burning ROM
   (i) Open Nero Burning ROM
   (ii) Click on New 
   (iii) Select ""DVD"" in the drop down menu (top left corner)
   (iv) Select DVD-ROM (UDF)
   (v) Click New and then drag the iso file there.
   (vi) It will ask to burn the compilation, select yes. Then Burn it.

Note : It's better to write at low speeds so that all the data is written to the disc without any errors.
Hope that helped."

Works better than the BIE release I had before. Some core fonts were corrupted in that. Not sure if it was my fault or the BIE release itself so not placing blame on anyone else. Was unable to fix the problem.

,Heartofthorns,2012-09-29T07:26Z,"@ werld
Besides BIE being a scene release group and their Windows not needing separate activator (as I heard it's already integrated) I honestly have no idea what's the difference. 
Hope someone else can expand on it or correct me if I'm wrong.
