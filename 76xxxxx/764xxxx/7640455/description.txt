Sahara (1983)

I could not find any good quality video of this movie in english, only a very poor quality VHS rip with half the screen cut-off. So I took a non-english version with good video and i took the audio from the VHSrip and it took me about a week because the 2 versions are not excatly the same movie but I got it edited and synced well enough I think. This is one of those older scenic movies that having a wide screen and nice video makes all the difference. Enjoy.
