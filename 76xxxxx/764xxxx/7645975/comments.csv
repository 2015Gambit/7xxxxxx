,sitapea1,2012-09-18T09:39Z,"People should learn something that 720p and 1080p are nothing, but only resolutions. They have nothing in common with quality."
,xsh4dowditx,2012-09-18T16:45Z,"No,but R5-6 usually suggests that it is a rip from a dvd-bluray in a different region. I knew by the screen when downloading this that it was not a bluray or a dvd for sure. I was just mentioning it for the folks who usually jumps to ''OMG it's HD'' because it has 720P in the title."
,hello40204,2012-09-18T17:04Z,"disagree . just watched it and compared it to a ts . this is at least like a dvdrip higher resolution. and yes, the 720p, has more details and colors . so no "

The point regarding 720p, is that you can take the crappiest quality and give it a high resolution, but doing so doesn't *** IMPROVE *** the actual *** QUALITY ***, it will never be better than what is was recorded as, having a high resolution boosts the ability to maintain the finer details when it is recoded / resized / edited / etc... But a TS or Cam, is still a TS or a Cam regardless of it's resolution.....

FYI - I'm a graphic designer :P

[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-18T20:26Z,"^^^ Yes - of course it 'Is what it is', that's why it's in the High-Res category, because it is High-Res. Not because it's a bluray, otherwise it would say 'Bluray' in the torrent title.

FYI - I'm a tax dodger :P"

Ok, it's surely TS quality, but picture is as good as you can expect a TS to be, kinda like watching a modern movie that looks like it was filmed in the 80s. Audio is a bit out of sync. But if your a big fan and are dying to see this film, then you will be satisfied.

FYI - The federal income tax was never ratified, (Didn't have enough states to support it) but Woodrow Wilson pushed it through on Dec. 23 while congress was off for the holidays. The federal income tax is unconstitutional and you can not actually * FIND A LAW * that says you have to file it on your income tax."
,s1nt3k,2012-09-19T01:50Z,"@darkrose6, your right but you would still loose in a  court if you try to argue based on the constitution because it wouldn't apply to the case. Most people loose when they bring up the constitution or if they ask for proof of a law that states you have to pay your taxes even though there is none. How most people loose is because they bring up things that have no merit to the case. 

You see where they get you is when you open a bank account you agree to follow the rules and regulations of the bank. One of the rules that the banks have is that you agree to pay all of your taxes when you open an account with them. 

The reason why most people loose is merely contractual. You violated the contract that you made with the bank and so the IRS goes after you. Food for thought."

Interesting, yes food for thought. However I do have a nice edge in the sense that I haven't had a US Bank Account in 12 years :)"
