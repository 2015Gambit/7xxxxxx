,el_guapito,2012-09-18T16:31Z,THANK YOU!! ...uhh if you have time could you rip the subtitle also? subscene is delayed in these kinds of things....
,MIAMIRON9,2012-09-18T20:22Z,good luck asking for the subtitles when he cant even provide a Description on any of his uploads. TV TEAM IS LIKE McDonalds you'll get the item but forget about anything xtra

,netgrazer,2012-09-19T20:14Z,"Audio level is ridiculously low... I understand the need for subs and complaints about ""no audio""."
,culatr,2012-09-20T20:24Z,"@ MIAMIMORON - how many torrents do you have available for download???  That's pretty much what I thought.  If you don't like TVTeam, go somewhere else you indignant little prick...Don't let the big words scare you."
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T09:51Z,@culatr you mean word not words & YOUR the one who seems angry.@miamiron9 is being truethfull if anything & he didn't even need to google a word to do it like you did
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T09:57Z,"oh ya,@culatr you realy shouldn't bring up the lack of torrents other people have available when you yourself have nothing to offer....fucking noob ass teenagers"
