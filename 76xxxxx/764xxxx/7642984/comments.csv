,tflagger997,2012-09-18T01:24Z,"Not HD, just more automatically re-posted lies by green skull groups.  Their defense - well the site we took it from called it HD and we cannot be bothered to verify before we spam TPB with it."
,s1nt3k,2012-09-18T04:43Z,"TS; Telesync means a copy which was shot in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, directly connected to the sound source. 

HDTS; is a Telesync done with a High Definition camera.

 That doesn't mean you will get a blue-ray quality cam, it only means that it's a high quality cam. The green skull means the upload is from a highly trusted source."
