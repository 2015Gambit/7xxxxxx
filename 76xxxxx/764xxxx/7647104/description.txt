Best Look and Feel Recommendations

    Turn App Drawer transparency to 15-20 or so, This makes it look more like TouchWiz 5
    Keep Stock Backgrounds (There are only 5 GS3 Official wallpapers)
    If GS3 Icon's don't show for your STOCK Apps (Email,Contact, etc)
    Press and hold the icon, Click "Edit", Click the Icon, press "Select from icon packs", choose "Galaxy S3 Apex Theme" and find the icon needed.
