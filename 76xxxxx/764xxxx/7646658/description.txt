The Race for Colour

Technology Documentary hosted by Antonia Quirke, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Antonia Quirke looks at the history of the colour film industry to find out who produced the first moving colour images. Movies were a wonder of the Edwardian age, but they were only in black and white. With a fortune at stake, a desperate race began to be the first to invent moving colour images, with back stabbing businessmen, amazing engineering and a tragic death all involved. Now, researchers at the National Media Museum in Bradford have made a remarkable discovery that rewrites film history. Brighton may have been the Hollywood of the Edwardian age, but the question is: who actually came first in the race for colour?
