As for the recording, wow. I'm speechless. 

As for what I did, a few hard line frequencies needed to be controlled, then slightly enhanced and maximized. 

As for why I did it, the ultimate hope of having it be even more enjoyable for me to listen to. It is indeed. 

As for sharing, that's for you to decide.

PRE-13 SOURCE INFO
====================
====================

Here it is, the infamous Meddled ROIO, feverishly sought after by
Floyd fans wanting to hear what Meddler was supposed to sound like
before being mistakenly editted to mono.

It came from an FM broadcast over the BBC in England.  The stereo
dimension adds so much to the recording, you can actually hear very
distinctly what each band member is doing.  

This ROIO is just an incredible listen from start to finish.  The 
sound is amazing as is the performance of the Floyd.  Fat Old Sun
never sounded better.  It is important to note, Embryo and Blues
came from a different original source I believe.  You can read all
about this title (and Meddler) at the following URL:

One of the best Floyd ROIO's ever made, bar none.  Sit back with a 
nice big fat one and enjoy the music.
