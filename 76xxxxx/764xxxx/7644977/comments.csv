,mf-den,2012-09-24T07:39Z,"@southak: I don't understand as to how u r saying its not HD, is it based on the size that u r talking abt. Our main aim is to provide quality 480p and 720p HD encodes at smaller filesizes thats why we encode them from the original size and post it in sizes where ppl with low bandwidth can afford them. I assure u we do our encodes from the 720p HDTV sources and not any avi source. That is why, I even mentioned re-encoded to 480p."
