VHS rip English. This is a redo of my other torrent, to reduce file size.

Please Note: Crappy vhs equals intermittent brief distortion flickers in spots courtesy of my vid card, not too too bad. Additionally, the picture clarity is fairly poor, faces at distance are blurs. Other that that ; ) Not too bad, complete.

For the fan who has never seen it.

the Little Tough Guys in Newsboys' Home - 1938

A very different film, murder mystery/newspaper circulation war. Today, newspapers are going out of business as technology pushes onward.

Also featuring Jackie Cooper as Rifle, who soon takes over.
