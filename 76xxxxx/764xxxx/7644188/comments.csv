English phonetical equivalent).  There is no teaching of Hangul in the book.  To do so requires outside study which would probably render this book useless.  Further, most of the text tells the reader to listen, which suggests there is a missing audio component.  That's confirmed on the last page (16) which tells the reader about the accompanying CD which is absent from this download.  At the time of this writing the CD does not appear to be on tpb."
