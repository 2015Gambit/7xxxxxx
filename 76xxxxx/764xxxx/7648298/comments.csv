Thanks.

I also have The Dark Knight (2008) in 60FPS but the file size is huge... 12.4 gb if there is anyone interested."
,.KRAAG.,2012-09-20T10:40Z,"Why bother with 60fps? is this for 3d tv's or something?

human eye/brain can only render around 25fps..."
,supergogo,2012-09-21T20:32Z,"@.KRAAG.
Wrong. Read the reviews of 3d ready 120hz monitors raving about how smooth the desktop become at 120hz. Search youtube for ""Can Linus See More than 60Hz??? NCIX Tech Tips."" Even my sister could see a difference on 120hz vs 60hz in a ""blind test"" (where she doesn't know what the monitor is set at).

If the video has motion blur, it looks smooth, but not solid. If the TV can interpolate the frames, it looks smooth and solid. I wonder if this 60fps video has frames interpolated, or is 3d...?

So there :P"
,C1hrisin,2012-09-22T15:57Z,This didn't work for me. All my media players said could not render
,chalotn,2012-09-23T08:43Z,"@supergogo thanks for clearing that up... the video looks smooth and solid.

@C1hrisin Try downloading k-lite mega codec pack"
