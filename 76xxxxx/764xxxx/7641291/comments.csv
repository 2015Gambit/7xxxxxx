,lough,2012-09-30T09:42Z,"The original core.lib (the one in this torrent) failed to remove the 15 day killswitch, only removing the 50 data export limit until the deadline, after which the program reverts to a permanent trial. I have fixed this oversight, but am wondering whether any of you are going to seed; otherwise, I will not waste my time uploading. You four currently waiting for an seeder, are you going to screw the next four the way others have now left you hanging? Vote up the quality for this torrent and leave comments when you leech; maybe the update will come soon.

To those who can't be bothered to use a miniscule fraction (~1kbps) of their bandwidth to give back to the community that benefits them:

Enjoy your trial program! The core.lib file was not intentionally hamstrung, so I guess it's just your karma! Looks like she got you again, moochers."
,dzakrk,2012-09-30T11:01Z,sup lough can you seed this. Or at least can you give some insight on the core.lib .. as I can see it is not a dll file so it's just a data file which also has the limits hardcoded into it?
,dzakrk,2012-09-30T16:08Z,"ok, I'm done with this.. it was pretty hard because of the messy Python interpreter. If you want a tip, try Tsearch :) good luck lough, I'm no moocher."
