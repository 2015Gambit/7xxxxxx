Synopsis - As sadomasochistic yakuza enforcer Kakihara searches for his missing boss he 
comes across Ichi, a repressed and psychotic killer who may be able to inflict levels of pain 
that Kakihara has only dreamed of.

This is the Japanese film Ichi the Killer with hardcoded English subtitles. The film is in 720p, 
and the audio is stereo 96kb. I made this as a request. I figured I can't be the only person that 
streams their movies and hates it that the sub files are not picked up. 

Please seed!!! And remember, sharing is caring!!!
