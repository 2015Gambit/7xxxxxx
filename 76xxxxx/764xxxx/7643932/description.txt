ItΓÇÖs the end of the world. Six students have taken cover in Cortege High but shelter is little comfort when the dead outside wonΓÇÖt stop pounding on the doors. One bite is all it takes to kill a person and bring them back as a monstrous version of their former self. To Sloane Price, that doesnΓÇÖt sound so bad. Six months ago, her world collapsed and since then, sheΓÇÖs failed to find a reason to keep going. Now seems like the perfect time to give up. As Sloane eagerly waits for the barricades to fall, sheΓÇÖs forced to witness the apocalypse through the eyes of five people who actually want to live. But as the days crawl by, the motivations for survival change in startling ways and soon the groupΓÇÖs fate is determined less and less by whatΓÇÖs happening outside and more and more by the unpredictable and violent bids for lifeΓÇöand deathΓÇöinside. When everything is gone, what do you hold on to?
