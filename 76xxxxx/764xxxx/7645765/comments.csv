The quality was top notch (it's an inexpensive doco so it doesn't look amazing but I assume this rip reflects the best it'll ever look).

I'd not heard of the subjects before. I'm not a big fan of MDMA or else I expect his name would be already revered.

However, I found watching it to be a very poignant experience and I think the Shulgins deserve better (not to mention his DEA agent friend who seems to have a few regrets).

Thanks again for the upload. You brought the light."
