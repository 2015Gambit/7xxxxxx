How to play Special ops. online (L.A.N.) using TeknoMW3 2.92:
            ------------


Method A:
--------

- Install the game updated to 1.4.382 version (or update it to that version). I recommend "Modern Warfare 3 1.4.382 repack full (2xDVD5) FINAL" from "http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7145705".

- Copy all the files and directories which are inside the folder "UPDATED_FILES" to the folder where the game is intalled and overwrite. Your game will be now updated to 1.9.446 version and with all DLCs.

- Start the game with "TeknoMW3.exe" and see the ".txt" file within "#JIMBO" folder.



Method B:
--------

- Download Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 directly from Steam using GreenLuma. You'll get an updated version of the game, but without the 3 DLCs.

- Copy all the files and directories which are inside the folder "UPDATED_FILES" to the folder where the game is intalled and overwrite. Now you will also have all DLCs and Teknogods' files.


- Start the game with "TeknoMW3.exe" and see the ".txt" file within "#JIMBO" folder.
