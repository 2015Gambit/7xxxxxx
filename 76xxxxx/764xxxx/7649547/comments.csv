,Kv99,2012-09-18T16:41Z,Any chance of a 1080p version soon?
,zilebg,2012-09-18T16:42Z,real or fake?
[T],xxbel,2012-09-18T16:43Z,WEB-DL? =.=''
,rossi046,2012-09-18T17:02Z,"Is this real hd or just another upscaled sd dvd rip?, anyone?"
,Simonus18,2012-09-18T17:08Z,"Perfect quality after long waiting, thank you man. I guess 1080p gonna be after oct.9, or sooner"
,srmea,2012-09-18T17:50Z,"Thanks dude .....

Thank you very much dude...

I was waiting for it.

,BloodKil_,2012-09-18T18:54Z,"Its real...   

For those that are QQ  WEB DL WTF.  Its the Digital DL version that was to be released ahead of bluray.

Still hoping for a full disk BRRip soon, but this is the absolute best you will get until someone leaks a disk."
,kyenahjab,2012-09-18T19:49Z,is it free of cinavia?
,rossi046,2012-09-18T20:13Z,"Its hd alright, shame its mkv, PS3's dont recognise that format"
,kow626,2012-09-18T20:19Z,Runtime indicates theatrical cut. I'll hold out for the extended version in 1080p.
,gozinya,2012-09-18T21:25Z,"@rossi046, just download freemake video converter and convert this to mp4, ps3 will play it no problem."
,Ajube0476,2012-09-18T21:28Z,"@rossi046

Just use mkv2vob.. it converts mkv to ps3 compatible video."
,Ajube0476,2012-09-18T21:30Z,and don't listen to gozinya.. he would have you re-encode this to mp4 which is much much slower.... mkv2vob takes only a few minutes to convert.
,Oblivilot,2012-09-18T21:50Z,"That, and it's uploaded by BOZX. That alone tells me it's 100% legit..."
,gozinya,2012-09-18T21:51Z,Just trying to help a guy out. Didn't know of MKV2VOB until now...excuse the fuck outta me.
,name112,2012-09-18T22:39Z,@gozinya lol I know what you mean..
,rossi046,2012-09-18T22:50Z,"@ gozinya, ajube, thanks"
,DownloadSafe,2012-09-18T22:51Z,@rossi046 imho the best way to watch mkv's on PS3 is to use PS3 Media Server. It will transcode on the fly and u don't need a very powerful pc to do so.
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2012-09-18T23:18Z,"Hey @rossi046, @gozinya, @Ajube0476, PS3 will play your mkv files untouched if you stream them from your pc, mac, boxee... in your network. All you have to do is have your pc on. Even the original WMPlayer streams it or you can dowload divx player"
,k00bz,2012-09-19T03:30Z,"This movie is such a disappointment. It has a terrible story line, nothing makes sense. Unlike the previous 'Alien' movies, this is just a piece of garbage that is beautifully wrapped in CGI.  Just saying.

If you love great scifi, this movie isn't it.  But see for yourself. "
,Ajube0476,2012-09-19T04:38Z,"@k00bz, Sorry to hear that for 'you'.. ""nothing makes sense"". But thankfully for people who can think and that understand this movie takes place prior to the first Alien movie.. it makes perfect sense and helps expand the story. 
I'm not saying you aren't welcome to your opinion.. you are of course. I'm saying your opinion is wrong.
@victor.brazil.qwerty, yes I know that already.. already use PS3 Media Server. I love it for the ability to copy super-large bit rate brrips over to my PS3, 16gb and such. ;)
@gozinya You're a noob.. and your ignorance is poison. Stop infecting the community with it. Your 'help' as you call it is no help at all."
,leecher820,2012-09-19T06:55Z,"what's the video quality? Is it 10? pls let us know, anybody?!"
,Enzaki-DK,2012-09-19T07:22Z,you the man Bozx :D:D will upload all i can 
,ronin324,2012-09-19T07:32Z,"I gave up using the PS3 as a media player for my downloaded movies a long time ago, cinavia can suck it.and tired of converting them and transferring..I just use my old desktop that I don't use and hooked up to my TV via HDMI..no more hassles.."
,joky29,2012-09-19T07:44Z,"Can anyone who have downloaded tell us the screen time of this rip?
is it 2:27 or 2:04 ?"
,stumpalump,2012-09-19T08:44Z,"This copy was way better than I thought it would be.

Watched it on 72"" and I give it:
V/10
A/9"
,rossi046,2012-09-19T14:38Z,"@joky, it 2:04, its the theatrical version not the extended"
,gozinya,2012-09-19T14:54Z,"@ajube0746, funny, you call me the noob and your ""help"" sucks ass. I tried mkv2vob last night, and yeah it's fast and will play the movie on ps3, but it renders the scene menu useless because the ps3 sees it as ""unsupported"". I didn't see the point in making an issue of it, I figured I'd leave such childish behavior for you. You are an opinionated little prick who thinks he knows it all and gets a cheap thrill from knocking other peoples posts. Everyone has a different way of doing things and they can take it or leave it, all without your obnoxious commentary. I use freemake converter for it's ease of use and it's multi-functionality. Yeah, it takes 10-15 minutes (oh no!) but the end result is flawless. I'll say what I please to whoever I please, got it?"
,gozinya,2012-09-19T15:38Z,"And furthermore ajube, you may have noticed that there is vast difference of opinion on this film. While it's beautifully crafted it is widely known that the story has many implausibilities, and just like the rest of the community I understand the film and it's place in the timeline perfectly well. Stop trying to boost your insecure little ego by attempting to make others feel ""smaller"" than you. Grow up."
,skullcrush,2012-09-19T15:45Z,seed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[T],Gondy10,2012-09-19T16:30Z,"I must say buy Samsung TV (plays almost all format) or WD TV HD Media player, so no more hassle in converting.."
,SR4T9US,2012-09-19T17:53Z,"gozinya, great comment, you're right, he is a fucking smartass. Everybody has their own way of doing things but i don't fall for pissy little sissyboys who get uptight because you don't follow their advice. fuck it now to watch this great movie again in hi format..."
,S.C.I.,2012-09-19T18:26Z,"Hi guys,before hand thank you for another great upload,i have a nice expectation about this movie although it won't be 10/10 as far as people say.
I would like to ask you more experienced pirates why everytime i download new torrent with more than 5000 seeder it takes few days (or more) to have full download (my internet is 100/120 Kb/s).It's a pita see the torrent for 2/8 Kb/s for the first days.
Any help is appreciated.I use Bittorrent by the way
Cheers"
,gozinya,2012-09-19T18:30Z,"@SR4T9US, lol, I hear ya man. I couldn't help feeding into it, I've got this thing with bullies. On another note, yes, this is a great film (thanks to Ridley Scott) even with the story flaws. This rip is great quality (finally!) and looks awesome on my 67"". Thanks BOZX!"
,joky29,2012-09-19T21:23Z,@rossi046 Thanks.. !
,PauloFran,2012-09-19T22:08Z,"Extraordinary video quality.
Thank you!"
,Pacina,2012-09-20T00:04Z,"Thanks UL been waiting ages for this didn't want to watch it in a cam same with a few others eg. batman and spiderman will enjoy this while waiting for others.
On an other point what is with all the bitching in the comments about how to convert something?!?Gozinya gives an answer to a question the way he dose it and some asshole tells him/her that the idiots and to keep there sh!t advice(assholes words not mine) to them self's just because they use different software to them what kind or loner dick are you????? If you think mkv2vob is better just say that and let the person that asked how to convert to try both out and use what they like because if we all did it your way I'd tell you that you a retarded spastic that doesn't connect your laptop/PC to your TV and be done with the converting and then it wont take 2-15 mins to convert jack sh!t"
,gozinya,2012-09-20T01:24Z,"@Pacina, thanks for the backup...It's appreciated. Just so whoever cares knows, I use a converter rather than plug in because I don't have a wireless mouse and I don't want to have to get up to pause/rewind, etc., and because I download a ton of shit for my kids, and they are NOT going to be messing around with my laptop. In other words, I'm not a retard spastic, lol."
,themene,2012-09-20T02:15Z,"Your all idiots.  Get a computer for your tv, download a simple media player that's not WMP and connect it through HDMI or DVI.  Make sure your HDCP compliant and you don't have to convert shit."
,Gal3n,2012-09-20T02:43Z,"BOZX, nice as always!
But, what about a BluRay version?? 1080p? This doesn't look that hot..."
,k3Ck,2012-09-20T03:07Z,"The movie is really disappointing.

3/5 at best."

,obvious2me,2012-09-20T08:15Z,"Whats is up with everyone running these videos through a game system? Grab a 25 ft HDMI for $10 and plug your pc into your receiver, or HDTV.

I haven't come across any issues with downloaded vids."

Coming from someone who never has seen an Alien movie all the way through, I really liked this movie, it's like the inverse of Avatar, and very visually epic."
,zickboi,2012-09-20T13:10Z,"@Gondy10 i was surprised at how many video formats my Samsung can play straight from the tv i just have all my stuff on a portable hd, very cool"
,Brut_AY,2012-09-20T14:37Z,Great video and audio quality. Subtitles separate from movie itself. AAA+

,cjewelz,2012-10-01T13:13Z,"@icepilot, you should get a good quality surround sound system.  You talk so proudly of that samshit system you have.  samshit and lg'ay (and all other korean monkey brands) have been lowering the standards set by great Japanese brands such as Sony."
