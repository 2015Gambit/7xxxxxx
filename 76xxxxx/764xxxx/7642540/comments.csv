,InnerWard,2012-09-17T23:36Z,"Hello elegant_pie!  Just wanted to ask; 555 MiB for STEP seem a way bit small, is this a ''medium setting'' or...? Not that i would complain...i don't posses a i7... by the way..what is your own setup? running well with your STEP installation?   Heh...sorry for the so many questions...but do hope you answer ^^

Take care! (and a possible big thanks!!)
