Want to use Skyrim Total Enhancement Project, but can't be bothered to mess around with all those mods, sorting the load order etc?

Don't worry. Just download this and copy it over a vanilla Skyrim install. Magic!

I've wanted to do this for a while, since I first used STEP, but they kept saying they were totally going to reboot the project, so I waited for that. Now they have, and it's better than ever!
