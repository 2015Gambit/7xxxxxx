What's in this version : (Updated : Sep 13, 2012)

    Move all the root operations to the background thread. This change has a few advantages: if a superuser call is made and for some reason gets blocked it won't block the UI thread anymore. The application will also opens much faster than before. All in all the app its much smoother to use, specially swipping the tabs.
    Post in the respective XDA threads of send me an email if any problem occurs from this update - the unforeseeable can happen.

Required Android O/S : 4.0+
