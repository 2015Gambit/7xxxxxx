I didn't understand you man, sorry!
Would you please explain?

@moe451175
I'm not Egyptian, are you Russian? :)
You need to burn it using any burning software but with minimal speed.
Or you can install it from a USB drive using Microsoft tool.
Good luck.

@winx86
You're welcome. and thanks for your trust ;)"

,chocolateTitties,2012-09-23T18:22Z,"Why do you people never make it easy for the noobs? Why lord, why?

I downloaded the file. I burned the file onto a dvd using Nero Express Essentials. (i don't know how to change the speed). I changed the bootup sequence to run the cd/dvd drive (i think). Then when i boot up, it looks like it's trying to boot something (there's a flashing white line on the top left corner of the screen) but then it just goes on and boots up my regular windows xp. And yes, i already checked that my system supports windows 64. Is 86 different from 64?
What am i supposed to do with the ""windows loader""???. I thought it would just boot right up?
HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLP MMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEE"

16385 is for Windows 7 RTM while 17514 is for SP1.

@ibraram09
Anytime ;)

@chocolateTitties
Easier than this? May be you mean I come to your house and do it for you? :) That's easier, huh? :)
Sorry, just joking..
Why don't you open Google or Bing and type:
""How to install Windows 7""
You will find tons of helpful articles.
Regarding the architecture, if your system supports 64 and you have 4 or more gigabytes of RAM then you should use the x64 version.

By the way, I like your nick :)
Good luck."
,chocolateTitties,2012-09-23T22:18Z,"@Maherz 

Oh, thanks for responding. I actually found out how to do it in the end. I was burning the ISO image wrong.
The only conundrum i'm facing now is i want to PERMANENTLY delete my old windows files (windows.old). How do i do it?
I came from Windows XP.
If i had viruses on my old windows xp, would they still be on my computer now?
So basically i want to know how to permanently shred the entire windows.old folder. I know if i just delete it it won't be securely shredded.
Thanks!"
,chocolateTitties,2012-09-23T22:21Z,"@Maherz

Oh, also, why didn't i have to put in a serial key? All i did was loaded the Windows Loader.
Windows Loader said it was a free trial. Was it talking about windows being a trial, or Windows Loader?
I went to my computer and it says windows is activated though."
,kieran2793,2012-09-24T04:24Z,once this is downloaded how do i install it n that thanks
,Mengg,2012-09-24T16:36Z,ok now i want know what is the service pack 1 release date?i go see wiki beta is july 2010 and public is 2011.but i buy a dvd i check the exe file.is created in november 2010... is beta or public?
,rondo_h,2012-09-27T03:24Z,Thanks.
,jibbybobbob,2012-09-27T03:38Z,"One word-   VIRUS

If anyone's stupid enough to download this, then you DESERVE to have the virus. Maherz is a known trafficker of VIRUSES that track everything you do. If you already downloaded this then you might as well smash your computer and buy a new one because he has ALL of your information now.
Better hope you didn't take nudies of yourself."
,Mengg,2012-09-27T15:09Z,why u say got virus?and a trafficker?is really?
[V],Maherz,2012-09-27T20:10Z,"@chocolateTitties
Hello, happy for you girl :)
Just delete the Windows.old folder and you'll be fine.
Regarding the loader, it was talking about the status of your windows when it said trial.
After installing the loader run it again and you will see activated instead of trial ;)

@kieran2793
Search Google.

@Mengg
Is it SP1 the one you bought?

@rondo_h
You're welcome.

@jibbybobbob
Where did you get that from?
Why would I want to do that?
Is that what I get for helping people?
The virus you're talking about is coming from Windows Loader file, which isn't mine! I added it for people to be able to activate Windows.
And it isn't a virus actually, that's what they call false positive.
Try scanning my work and tell me if you find any viruses ;)
Good luck.

@Mengg
Read above."
,chocolateTitties,2012-09-27T22:18Z,"One last question:
Why is it that when i have multiple tabs open, on the corners of the tab it will flash like it's a bug or something. I've had windows 7 before and it never did this."

.Assalaam Walekum Bro :)

Can You Please Make x86+x64 ISO ? (Updated Off-course :P)"
[V],Maherz,2012-09-29T12:22Z,"@chocolateTitties
Don't know what you're talking about.
But did you install your video card driver?

Waalaikom assalam.
Sorry, don't have enough time.."
,nigz,2012-09-29T21:52Z,"hi maherz thanks for the upload, i have downloaded it and burned the iso file to a disc and when i run the disc it gets as far as the blue windows instalation screen which says ""setup is starting"" and it dosnt get any further. any help would be very much appreciated?"
,medicidudu,2012-09-30T14:08Z,"Hi Maherz, 

Thanks a lot for your upload, I really liked.. But I have something to ask you. In the first time that I burned to the DVD I forgot to put on MINIMAL speed and it was running at MAXIMUM speed, than when I tried to install, in the middle of the process it said that some files were missing or corrupted.. Now I'm burning again at MINIMAL speed :D, but is there a chance that the corrupted files are in the zip file that you uploaded? Or the corrupted files are from the burning process? Did anyone else successfully installed windows 7? 

(I don't wanna waste more DVDs xD)"
,medicidudu,2012-09-30T15:39Z,"Yeah Maherz :( .. 

Like I said in my previous comment, I just finhished burning again the DVD at MINIMAL speed and tried to install it, but in the exact same place (middle of installation) said that some files are missing or corrupt. :( 

Error code: 0x80070570"
,Mrinal0,2012-10-01T07:09Z,can it be updated ?
,medicidudu,2012-10-04T04:27Z,"Hi Maherz, I've commented 2 days ago.. and I just solved the problem.. The problem was that the program CCleaner that used to clean my computer made some damage in my system files.. to solve the problem I used the program RegCure Pro (awesome software by the way :D) to fix.. then when I tried to install windows 7 again it was a success, everything working just fine.. Thanks again for the upload ^^

One more thing.. your files of windows 7 doesn't have virus on it ;P .. but the windows loader (not created by you) has :/ I had to remove it, but nothing that a good antivirus doesn't do it ^^"
,lamportyx,2012-10-04T07:02Z,This is great man i just install this on my bnew laptop and it works and the activation is permanent and can download updates just like the original.. maherz you are my idol!!!
,lamportyx,2012-10-04T07:03Z,when will you upload the the october version?
