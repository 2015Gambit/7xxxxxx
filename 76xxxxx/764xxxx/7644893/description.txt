It&#x27;s a world where everyone tells the truth - and just about anything they&#x27;re thinking. Mark Bellison is a screenwriter, about to be fired. He&#x27;s short and chunky with a flat nose - a genetic pool that means he won&#x27;t get to first base with Anna, the woman he loves. At a bank, on the spur of the moment he blurts out a fib, with eye-popping results. Then, when his mother&#x27;s on her deathbed, frightened of the eternal void awaiting her, Mark invents fiction. The hospital staff overhear his description of Heaven, believe every word, and tell others. Soon Mark is a prophet, his first inventive screenplay makes him rich, and he&#x27;s basically a good guy. But will that be enough for Anna?
