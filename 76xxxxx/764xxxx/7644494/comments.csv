,SimmShady22,2012-09-17T17:50Z,"It's sad to see an awesome show like this get cancelled with all the crap that's on tv these days. Goodbye weeds, thanks for keeping me entertained."
,FamiliarStranger,2012-09-17T18:25Z,Sigh... i used to love Weeds. This was the worst season finale ever. Really disappointed.

,dee60,2012-09-17T18:49Z,Thanks for sharing.
,monkybizz,2012-09-17T21:29Z,ok peeps...this show has NOT been cancelled...the creator and the crew decided it was time to end the show...it was going to end with season 7 but they wanted one more season to finalize the characters...
,Jack0ff,2012-09-17T23:39Z,an incredibly shitty finale for an incredibly shitty show. i used to love weeds like everyone else here but the last 2 seasons are just fucking insulting. FUCK YOU Jenji Kohan!
,kingofmiami6,2012-09-18T02:16Z,"Update.. The finale actually was great since it told how all their lives end up. The very last scene was awesome.

,pimpmobile,2012-09-18T04:53Z,Kingofmiami you are crazy this episode sucked they could have ended it with something going on other than a bunch of talking there could have been a shootout or some naked sluts anything but all the talking! 
,TtToker,2012-09-18T07:36Z,"@PimpMobile, this show was for adults, not horny teens. If you followed the series and took the last episode as what it was meant to be, the last scene was full of emotion and somewhat brought it all around full circle. they had all moved on but they were all together again but it'll never be the same, ie its over.. "
,finsupfan,2012-09-18T19:11Z,eztv... thanks for all the episodes!  
,crashbang99,2012-09-22T05:19Z,"I personally think the finale was good, we got to get one last glimpse at all the main characters, and it was a clear calm believable way to end the story."
,SULTAN_201,2012-09-25T05:03Z,i really felt bad for Silas and Shane becuz the did not get a chance to go to school in the all seasons
