,piranical,2012-09-16T19:14Z,"imo, i'm not sure this is actually better than Unique's copy, but i do appreciate the effort. thanks froggie...uploaders are always trying to improve what's available so the more cam rips, the better. there's plenty of cam rips that just keep getting better and better in that regard eg. look how far the dark knight rises has come. obviously an actual dvd rip is some time away because this one has only recently come out at cinemas throughout the world.

Right!  They repost the same thing over and over, and somehow it just gets better according to you.  If you bothered to check your facts, you would see the video source is the same for all these versions.  The only thing that is changing is the audio, and it has not improved very much in the three versions here.   

At least we can thank froggie100 for not spamming like the other groups.  He seems to only post what he thinks is worth it."
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-16T21:58Z,"@tflagger997 - He does mean versions yes. Sometimes one group can come up trumps and deliver something great out of nowhere. Some people have preference and wait for a particular group to release their version. No problem with that, and it's all free!

Each to their own, that's all I say. I tried encoding for a while and I didn't have the patience, so give everyone their dues man!"
