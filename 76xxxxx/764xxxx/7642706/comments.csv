The picture quality is seriously lacking, unless you happen to be watching it on a mobile device; plus, it's framed at a 4:3 aspect ratio, meaning there's black bars above and below the image. And at certain points after the one-hour mark, a computer screen image can be seen popping into frame, which leads me to believe that this isn't a DVD rip, but a video capture. Audio quality is okay, though the volume level is low, and there are audible clicks and pops at various times throughout. See it if you must, but a proper DVD rip should be out soon, considering the movie hits stores next month."

,MarineLCP,2012-09-18T18:09Z,There's black bars above and below the image and different stuff popping up though out the movie covering the picture. the volume is low and it makes crackling noises. 
,maduke52,2012-09-19T01:48Z,should have read the comments  dont wish to repeat what others said but they are right. audio is terrible and some computer images start popping up after about 40 minutes in. Movie is ok if you have nothing else to watch  like a lifetime movie.
