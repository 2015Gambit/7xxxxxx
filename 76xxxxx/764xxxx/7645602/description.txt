Description:

These are original scans of the book Fuel Economy of the Gasoline Engine ISBN:0740991321 published in 1977 by Shell Research Limited in the UK. I am going to try to get it all into one nice PDF file, but for now here is it.

This book details the operation of the gas engine, and how inefficient it is. Shell scientists dabble with fuel vaporization and achieve upwards of 100mpg.
