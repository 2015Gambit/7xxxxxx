,Frucika,2012-09-18T08:59Z,Is this the pilot?
,13ip0lar,2012-09-18T09:33Z,I'm wondering that too. I guess I'll dl and report back since no one is likely to ever do the same. :/
,americas666,2012-09-18T09:44Z,is this one the same as yesterday or is it episode 2 
,tdk.kush,2012-09-18T10:02Z,This is exactly the same episode that was uploaded as the 'preview' about a week ago. (Just found that out the hard way)
,13ip0lar,2012-09-18T10:06Z,Same deal. It's the pilot. 
,tdk.kush,2012-09-18T10:06Z,This is the same episode that was known as the 'preview' that was uploaded about a week ago. So if you downloaded that don't download this as its the same. But as always eztv your torrents are excellent and very high quality.
,13ip0lar,2012-09-18T10:07Z,"Well I posted, but didn't show up. So if this double posts sorry. But this is indeed the pilot episode. No difference."

,Drakola,2012-09-18T12:05Z,strange storyline !no electricty??? evrything is !!!u can make it by rubbing two sticks ?????
,Jimmm90,2012-09-18T13:20Z," I don't get it...why would they air a ""pilot"" episode and then air the same episode again as episode 1, 2 weeks later? -.-"
,humpahoe,2012-09-18T13:54Z,^^ welcome to bullshit tv
,lovecat66,2012-09-18T15:41Z,"What a Hell is going on here ????!!!!! Why did they aired TWO times the same ""pilot"" ?! Last week SEP11,2012 the exact same episode was aired !!!"
,FK-Ramone,2012-09-18T17:59Z,"The previous releases was preair webrips, this is HDTV. I'm amazed that some of you actually manage to get dressed in the mornings..."
,Drakola,2012-09-18T20:25Z,"Yepp! it`s the pilot! i dont have a tv, but next week im on!!"
,devasko,2012-09-19T00:56Z,"This series is clearly made for geniuses, cause only a genius could figure out how to explain all the weird shit going on... IÂ´ll pass on this one cause im a dumbass. And even if im unemployed and got all the time in the world to download TV series I aint gonna watch this because the plot is obviously way too intricate for me and the greatness of the story will in all likely hood swosh right over my head anyway. Thank you very much tough eztv."

,janoslg,2012-09-19T22:13Z,"Really stupid show, how come humans are alive? our bodys are running on electrical impulses, not one muscle would work :)"

,Sknmissle,2012-09-20T07:25Z,"lol what garbage, bring Spartacus back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,xsadx,2012-09-21T02:41Z,JJ Abrams is a great writer 
,hoping4more,2012-09-22T05:04Z,Thanks for the upload!
,iamchrislechat,2012-09-24T10:03Z,"the reason for this being ""re-released"" is because the other one is what is know as an early release pilot usually shown weeks or months before the season starts to build interest.
as far as the show goes it isn't bad..... although highly unrealistic and probably brain boggling so for anyone with the slightest grasp of physics. i still think J.J is gonna fuck this up like he does all his shows and as always EZ rocks"
,Ammo8,2012-09-24T19:16Z,"@janoslg You DUMBA$$!!!! You really think that humans are affected by things like EMPs (Electro-Magnetic Pulse, as you were probably too much of a moron to know) and things like that? Unfortunately, we are NOT cyborgs, so we are not affected by it."
,Ammo8,2012-09-24T19:17Z,WTF kind of quality is it anyway? I'm not downloading till i know!
,stonefone,2012-09-25T20:02Z,@Pawas hahahahaha you watch Stargate?! gtfo
