I had some trouble getting the seeding to start and had given up. This is only the third movie I am uploading so I am not a pro in this.

BUT...it's now seeding.... :) It has english subtitles embedded that will play automatically when you play the movie in VLC or other media player.

I will seed 10 GB of this, or roughly 15 times the file size. For the movie to survive I ask you to seed too. 

It looks like I posted the movie twice. I will only seed on this link, where I managed to get the poster up too (a first for me).
