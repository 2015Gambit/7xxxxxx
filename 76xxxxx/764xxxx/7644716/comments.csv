I'll upload the corrected version.

You can fix this yourself. Get VirtualDub, load in this file,
click on ""video"" and select ""direct stream copy""
click on ""video"" and select ""frame rate""
Click ""change to"" end enter 23.976 and click ""OK""
Click on ""file"" and select ""save as avi""
Enter a slightly different filename or save to a different folder (so it doesn't try to
write over itself). The resulting file will run correctly."
