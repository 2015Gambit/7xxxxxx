can an admin please delete this cause i cant :/"
,bloodred125,2012-09-18T13:44Z,"borderlands 1 is 12Gb's installed, so im expecting larger files than this on release day."
,GLMC_Trax,2012-09-18T14:22Z,this is the legit version its just compressed extracted its still only 5.11gb
,asqw9,2012-09-18T16:21Z,I'll wait for peeps to test this but the size sounds about right. Borderlands 1 was also around 5gb when it first came out. Only when all the DLCs were added it became around 10-12gb.
,Darshe42,2012-09-18T17:45Z,"For those who haven't tested yet, if this is the set of pre-load files from the skidrow site, then it is lacking the audio files. When characters talk in-game (not in cutscenes) there is no audio or subtitles."
