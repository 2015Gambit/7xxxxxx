,Tgod420,2012-09-27T07:39Z,Aweseome thank you!
,fuctyou,2012-09-28T07:19Z,"Thank God for Strange Music. They put their heart and soul into every album they put out and it shows. REAL music in a world of fakes and phonies; music the way the artist intends it to be heard and not produced for radio and MTV. Turned on the radio lately? Glad to see comments from other true fans who will buy the album when they are able like myself. Lets keep these guys going, a shining lite in the darkness that is music today. "
,fuctyou,2012-09-28T07:23Z,Oh and thanks to warcry for the upload. It's like im 6 years old and its Christmas morning when Strange puts out a new album.
