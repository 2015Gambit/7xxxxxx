The Stephen King Collection: Stories from 'Night Shift' 10-CD audio book was released in 2005 by RandomHouse Audio. The selection of stories is read by John Glover.


Included in this torrent are tagged FLAC copies of the actual discs, as well as lossy copies that are appended together into their respective stories and encoded with the new Opus codec at 32kbps mono. The quality of the lossy copies far surpasses any other audio codec at 32kbps, and I enjoy quality so I decided to share them with you. As far as I know there are not a lot of applications that support the Opus codec at this point -- Firefox, foobar2000, and Videolan will, though.
