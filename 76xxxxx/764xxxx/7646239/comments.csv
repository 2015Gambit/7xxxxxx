,ramsqb13,2012-09-18T00:32Z,"WDM...I've loved your Stern torrents for many years. Is there any chance you could start doing Eddie Trunk on Hair Nation on Monday Nights, too? I would too grateful as I'm sure many others would be, also! Thanks for all your excellent hard work!"
,rev3n,2012-09-18T05:33Z,"I  had a few problems connecting via VPN for a couple days last week. It took a lot of tries to get the trackers to connect. All seems well now though, so I'm not sure why you guys are having problems with the trackers. I'm getting well over 2mb down on this torrent alone so no problems on the backend for now"
[T],MusicIsCoolio,2012-09-21T22:31Z,when it's first upped it may say 50 seeds but its lying.the same 700 people are all trying to get it at the same time everyday.we all finish at the same time and seeds got to 700+ in seconds.wait til an hour after its upped and it should be fast.
