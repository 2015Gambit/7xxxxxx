Muppet Show - Season 1 Mp4 converted, pulled the original avi's here, converted them for storage and handheld portable players. Looked actually pretty good off the tv as well (i aint as picky as some of ya), watched the Johnny Cash one and it sounded good enough for my 11 year old to say "Hes a good singer" So enjoy and help seed.
