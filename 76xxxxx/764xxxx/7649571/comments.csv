The game literally just came out not even a couple hours ago, people have to actually finish downloading in order to seed, it's going to take a while for a lot of seeders to develop.

,muff1nman,2012-09-18T21:36Z,@morp3d You can seed while you download. It doesn't matter how many people are done just how many copies of the game there are total for people to get pieces from. I'm only getting 40kbps at best and seeding THE SAME FUCKING AMOUNT. There are 18k people taking up all the download without putting any back in. Then we have 1.5k people who are actually being gentlemen and seeding. So each seeder is sharing to about 18 people at once. The reason you seed while you dl is that people can get pieces they need from you without wasting the bandwidth of people who have complete copies. You're pretending that a torrent is downloaded in order. It takes whichever piece is most available. If all of the people with complete copies are seeding to faggots then it slows down the torrent because the leechers are the only ones getting the game and not passing it on.

Even though I didn't download from you personally (way to slow, decided to download from a private site @ 8.7mb/s) but you rock for getting this up so damn fast! It came out today you guys, and for everyone bitching about the thousands of Leechers and no seeders.. Well most people download at 1mb/s or LESS, so most of them need to download for the entire day if not more.. So give it a day or so before they start to balance out and stuff.. 

Another thing for people saying this isn't legit, EVERYTHING from extremezone is legit.. Everything, not one thing thing that I have downloaded from him/her was not what it says to be nor harmed my computer.. Yes your Anti-Virus may say, ""ALERT"" but the code has been hacked thus giving the appearance of a virus.  Now some may be virus infected but this game comes a very, very trusted source Extremezone and Skidrow... Stop your bitching about it...

Also I get really sick and tired of reading the same comments over and over again about installation problems or sound issues, when there has been a posted solution.  I understand if there is not yet one created to get peoples attention but read the damn comments before posting an already solved issue. :) Thanks...

,nbsohdrov,2012-09-19T08:27Z,"Why you need to block games in your firewall:
The crack normally bypasses offline checks, but groups like skidrow don't have time to root out all the possible timebomb and online checks that the devs could have embedded. The game could for example update without asking to a newer version for which there is no crack, discover that you're using a cracked version and delete the game, etc."

There is NO virus or whatever else you idiot's think there are in this torrent.  The uploader is one of the most respected members/uploader on this site.  Go and download an actual virus scanner and not Norton or McAfee.

,PhreakingPanda,2012-09-19T15:36Z,"Also, as a secondary note, this game works flawlessly with Tunngle. Also, it seems to include what I assume to be the ""preorder"" status as well as the function that gives you extra stuff for having Borderlands 1 save file. There are NO viruses in this torrent. I didn't even get a false positive set off, even though extremezone warns to add an exclusion in your virus protector. 

Another thing to note, as I've noticed alot of people saying the sound doesn't work (most likely meaning cutscenes), I have no issue whatsoever with the sound in normal gameplay or cutscenes. As I said above, it works perfectly.

Again, good luck with the download/install and enjoy the game once it is installed. If you enjoy this game(Which I'm sure you will, I did), support the developers!"

,brianxxx,2012-09-19T18:17Z,"@xstinct
No problem if you need help. EVERYONE was a NOOB at some point, even the cocky assholes likely to mock you. 

First of all, what you are goingt o do is copy the SKIDROW folder files to a location in the game installation directory. This is going to be a common task for all future games, not just this one.

Second - before you do this, make sure you make backups of all files that are going to be overwritten, in case you need to start over without uninstalling/reinstalling entire game.

OK - in the ISO is the Skidrow folder and within that is a tree of other folders - the top level folder is BINARIES. Copy that folder and contents to X:Program Files2K GamesBorderlands 2 directory. NOTE - X is your correct drive letter and Program Files might be Program Files (x86) if 64bit OS.

Example - mine is G:Program Files2K Games(x86)Borderlands 2 because I install all my games to a second hard drive and I run Win 7 Pro 64bit."

Yes, you can upload while you download, this is the point of bittorrent. The seeds don't send you the entire file, they send you some of it and the rest to some other guys and then we're supposed to exchange what we have. Now if you don't have proper upload rate, this has to be at least 30 kb/s, I have it at 500 kb/s. It depends on your connection. Get it as high as you can without affecting download speed. This is important! If everyone does this within half an hour everyone with slow download speeds will get this game in an hour.

Secondly, this torrent is 100% working. How ever, you CANNOT play ONLINE multiplayer. If you wish to play 4 player co-op with your friends you will need a VPN such as Hamachi or Tunngle and you will have to play thru a LAN. It's quite simple.

If the torrent is still loaded in your torrent client try right-clicking on it and choosing ""Force Recheck"" (You might have to stop the torrent first).  This will go through the whole thing and check the CRC's of each piece, and the ones that are corrupt it will remark as needing to be downloaded again.  Then you restart the torrent and get the pieces you still need.  (I'm assuming the torrent is correct because so many people have posted about it working)."

You should be able to put the dll file in the same directory as the borderlands2.exe file, as it always looks there first.

If it isn't working it might be because there are a few different versions of that dll with the same name (out on the net), I had that problem once."

Blocking the program in firewall keeps it from ""calling home"" and finding out that it's not a legal copy.  This will also prevent online play, but usually you can't do that anyway with these cracked copies.   (borderlands 1 was a rare exception).

Telling your antivirus that buddha.dll is a safe file keeps your antivirus from blocking the file from running  (Almost all anti-virus companies label _every single_ bit of cracked software as a virus, usually a malicious one!, even if they aren't malicious at all.  It's kind of a collusion with software producers to scare everyone away from cracked software).

2) After I could move it, double click and game won't start.

Added in Microsoft Security Essentials (My AV), and added exclusion specifically to buddha.dll and it worked - Able to copy

first windows7 when u hit the play option from the game launcher and it wont do shit (nothing at all) download the steam game cliant. I would provide u with a link but just googgle it you will find it.then open the cliant and hit the login option....STOP you dont need to regester with steam or loggin just open the cliant to loggin and run borderlands 2 shuld work now:)
as for playing borderlands2 online download a program called Tunngle. Again google it.
once you have Tunngle and you have regestered with Tunngle and you are logged in.
type ( borderlands 2 into Tunngles network search engine. ok shuld bring up lotts of options./Join a borderlands network/i found lots of them. Anyways once you are connected to a borderlands network from Tunngle/ open your borderlands2 game select the LAN  network option from the main menue
After that just go to the find game option and choose a game or tell yer freinds what network yer on and BAM YER ONLINE
thanks...."
,BloodKil_,2012-09-20T09:50Z,"@cootery

As opposed to re-dl a whole other torrent, you can simply have your client re-check the files and if there are errors with some of the blocks it will simply redownload them only.  Thats the beauty of torrents.

(eg. it might check and find a handful of bad blocks and restart your dl with 98.6% complete)

As for anyone else having issues its either your PC or its you, because its not the game.

As said before must have steam on PC (dont have to be logged in to account, just steam installed)

Make sure when the DL is finished you allow it to install the latest direct x and distributable packs (even if you think your up to date it doesnt hurt to install them)

Make sure you are on the latest GPU drivers.

Make sure you copied the binaries folder over (crack)

If it doesnt work from there, its a issue with your PC and youll have to do a bit more digging.

Been playing this since Tuesday night and it works flawlessly on and off line.

,moeburn1,2012-09-22T08:46Z,"guys, this is a popular torrent.  This is how the download speed is for every popular game on the first few weeks after it was released on torrent.  My max DL speed is 1mB/s, but I get an average of 100kB/s.  In this torrent, and in all the other very popular ones.

The simple fact is that there are more leechers than there are seeders.  While I'm sure some people are turning off their seeding once they finish dling, that isn't the main problem.  There just isn't enough bandwidth to go around for everyone.  If you're like me, you'll get your max dl speed for a few minutes every now and then, and then it will drop back to 0.

It's enough to finish downloading within 2-3 days.  For a 7GB game, that's plenty fast enough.  If you want maximum bandwidth, go download some tv torrents."

For those of you who actually know how to properly install cracked games and are still having a certain issue in particular... 

I'm referring to the one where the game freezes after around five to ten minutes of play. 

All I did to fix this was run the game with the original Borderlands 2 Launcher, not the one that comes in the crack folder and lets you set and save the game's language. 

(It's also worth noting that I did use the 3DM crack regardless of not having any issue actually getting the game to start up in the first place.) "

Secondly, for anyone having the issue I had and has an ATI card, if you are getting massive slowdown like less than 20 FPS and single digit FPS in combat, install the PhysX driver and set phyiscs in game to low. My FPS shot up to 65 FPS. To all the fucking whining ass children out there I GOOGLED IT and after 30 minutes of researching found  the solution. Stop posing shit like ""OMG HOW DO ICRACK!!!!!

Follow your own advice. I was bitching about the link spammers posting the fake free games links, and the idiots who apparently cannot read. What the fuck are you bitching about?

For fucks sake... You cannot even spell loser correctly. 

The game works perfectly for 99% of us. Those with problems are the vast minority. And reading the comments, they either do not have Steam installed, or are somehow unable to complete the simple install methods.

The 3DM crack is the only way to go if they cannot or will not install Steam. Otherwise it is useless. And you are repeating advice given before by suggesting it as the magic bullet to slay the problem.

Does it get you hard to insult a person you do not know in the comments of a torrent on the Internet? That is all you did. Your post is as useless as this reply to your post.

Were you one of the bitches posting links to a survey scam that pretends to give you the full game for free? If not then what the fuck is your motive to bitch at and insult me?

To all the non-cry-babies out there: This game is pure awesome. I am buying it next payday. I advise you to do the same when able. And if you cannot, then I feel for you. But you will still enjoy the hell out of the Skidrow version until the price drops enough."
