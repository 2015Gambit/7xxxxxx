Lithic transforms your photos into realistic mini comic book / graphic novels providing customisations for layout, captions and more. Its state of the art filter creates effects from Van Gogh's painterly style to the harsh and gritty film noir look of Frank Miller.

Features:

    Eight photo layouts.
    A highly customizable filter that lets you achieve a range of creative effects such as graphic novel, woodcut, pencil and oil-painting.
    Customizable caption for each panel in the layout.
    A gallery for viewing your stylized images.
    New features and improvements are in the works so keep watching this space!
