Ask any audiophile -- you can't encode a lossy encode to a lossless one. Itunes generally run their m4a's at around 256 kbps --lower than 320-- so encoding these 256 m4a's to 320 mp3's is the equivalent to creating fool's gold.

If this however is a genuine 320 kbps mp3 copy and the source is simply referring to where you can purchase it legitimately, then I aplogise and thank you humbly regardless for taking the time to upload any content at all."
