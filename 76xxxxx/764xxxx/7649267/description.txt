China on Four Wheels

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Anita Rani and Justin Rowlatt, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Anita Rani and Justin Rowlatt embark on two epic car journeys across China, navigating congested cities and winding mountain roads, to explore how the country's economic growth, symbolised by its booming car industry, is affecting people's lives.

Part 1.
In the first programme, Anita takes the high road through the rich, industrialised cities of the east, driving a Great Wall Haval, the best-selling 4X4 in China. Meanwhile Justin drives a 'bread van', the loaf-shaped workhorse of the countryside, through China's poor rural hinterland, and discovers that here donkeys are often more common than cars. He visits the 'ghost city' of Ordos and puts his bread van through its paces on China's second-biggest racing track. On the first leg of their journey, Anita and Justin discover a country that has developed rapidly, raising millions out of poverty. But it faces important challenges that may affect us all: a potential property bubble, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and growing inequality.
