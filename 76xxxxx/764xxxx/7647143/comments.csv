Thanks for this torrent, but before I download, I would like to confirm the version(s) with you. Is this the FCPX 10.0.5, Motion 5.0.4, and Compressor 4.0,4? If yes, thank you very much.

If no, nevertheless, thanks for sharing.

Also, would be great if you could say something about future updates. Would there be a requirement to re-download and reinstall or can be just directly update from Apple Store, after having installed from here?

Regards
-LORD-"
