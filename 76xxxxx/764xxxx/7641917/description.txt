First of all, this torrent wasn't done by me, I just found it on another site and downloaded it, and since it has very good quality of a show that I like.. I decided to post it here to share it with a bigger group of people.

So if you like it keep seeding and share.



This contains the fist six episodes of Space Battleship Yamato 2199, in BlueRay 1920*1080 H.264 resolution.

Of course the language is Japanese but English subs are contained with the video file itself.

If you're having trouble playing the files or viewing the subs with it, just use KM KM Player or VLC Media Player.
