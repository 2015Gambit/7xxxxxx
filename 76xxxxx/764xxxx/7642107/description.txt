Source Engine source code (dated somewhere between 2007-2010, includes Half-Life 2, Half-Life 1: Source, Counter-Strike: Source, Portal, Team Fortress 2, HL2: Episode 1, HL2: Episode 2 source code) without content (compatible with hl2, hl1:source, hl2: ep1,hl2: ep2, tf2, portal content).

This is not a fake, this is the sources from CSmania.RU, which were leaked on 12 September. I can prove it in any possible way.
