,DenMorph,2012-09-21T22:40Z,"Actually, the title explains it completely.  It really doesn't even need a description.  So I suppose the description is 100% useless, since you don't even need it.

If you are looking for aTV Flash, you would know what it is and what it is used for.  Also ""Seas0npass"" in the description is a dead giveaway.  This is software for jailbreaking Apple TVs.  So, it's assumed by even looking at the torrent that you know what it is for - otherwise, why would you be looking at it?  Hence, the description is 100% useless (but probably not in the way you meant).

I suppose by your logic that if I put up a torrent titled ""Mac OS X Mountain Lion DMG"" that the description would need to explain what Mac OS X is, what OS X is for, what it does, etc.  However, it's assumed that you know what OS X is, so the only instructions given in the description (if any) would be a few tips on how to install it."
