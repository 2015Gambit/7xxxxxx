Crazy people need to reap what they sow.  
Please Westerners, give them what they want.

Quit giving them money.

Quit giving them access to our technology.

Let them roll around in the mud while our technology allows us to develop ourselves uniquely, like nature intended, instead of spending our lives working for bare survival.
