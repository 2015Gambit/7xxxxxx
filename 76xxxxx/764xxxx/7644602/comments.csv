Cool, thanks. I can't keep my laptop seeding starting tomorrow due to school, so I'm hoping to seed as much as possible by then."
,black.hat,2012-09-17T23:24Z,"first off, thanks for uploading this @Presidium

it took me over nine hours, but i finally got the entire file. so you can shut down your laptop for now and know that your torrent will live on  :-)

good job with your first torrent, by the way...i think some folks create torrents and don't realize that they have to seed them.  this one was steady for the whole day

how long do you want this thing seeded?  i'll do whatever i can to keep a good torrent alive"

Thanks for the feedback. This is one of those long-term torrents, I hope. As time goes on, Halo 2 will only become more scarce, and hardcore Halo fans will love the opportunity to still get Gamerscore points on Xbox LIVE via Halo 2 (PC), which is very unique. I'm gonna continue to seed it whenever my computer is home. Any support is nice as well. Thx"

,Presidium,2012-09-24T14:35Z,"@prodallas

Its not useless for those who already have a key, legally obtained or otherwise.

As stated in the description."

What about someone who hasn't ever had d game before or purchased it, therefore, he wouldn't have a key. could d game still go for him?"
,Presidium,2012-09-29T16:25Z,"@poseidon1155

Because this file is not altered in any way (it's the exact ISO image from my disc), without a key, you cannot play the game. Sry :/"
