2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Now we're up to 1011 titles for the year.  Finally reaching my goal!  This 38th bundle today contains only Christian hip-hop and rap music.  I have a 39th as well as a 40th bundle in the making, but I thought it might be a little different to include only one genre of music in a bundle.  And since I had a lot of unshared hip-hip and rap, it only made sense.

So the 23 titles in this 39th bundle today include...

 * Big Mic - 2012 - Go Hard Or Go Home, Vol 3
 * Cixx - 2012 - Tha Terminator - Salvation, Vol 1
 * DJ KC Perfect - 2012 - Church Boy Riding
