Abraham-Hicks 1993 AV-1 Intro to Abraham VHS Rip+MP3


In 1985, Jerry and Esther Hicks began dialogs with Abraham. But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. Abraham is a Non-Physical entity ΓÇö whom Esther calls "infinite intelligence" and Jerry stated, "the purest form of love I've ever encountered."


The Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience. 

Abraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Non-physical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self.
