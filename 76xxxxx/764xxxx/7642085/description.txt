Here's a re-pitched, de-clicked, de-hummed and EQ'd version of that upload. 
It was hard trying to improve this recording since there was nearly nothing 
to work with, but I thought it was worth a try... Hope you'll enjoy!

Here's another one i picked up at that long gone Beatles torrent site. Claimed to be an audience tape, i think its an AM radio b'cast. This is a remaster of the silver cd that is most certainly an improvement over it. I have no info about the extraction or remastering methods. The above notes were supplied in that original torrent.
