Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the continuing drift toward war as the Middle East burns in response to an amateurish video purportedly produced by a network of neocons to rile up Muslims and produce an October Surprise for presidential candidate Mitt Romney. 

Alex also covers the Fed's latest effort to bail-out the banksters and decimate the living standards of average Americans by devaluing the dollar and ushering in punishing inflation. 

On today's show, Alex talks with historian and author Webster Tarpley about the situation in the Middle East and also former trader and television show host Max Keiser.
