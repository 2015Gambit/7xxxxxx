[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-16T09:15Z,"gravitysewers, well, crap! It seems I don't have the version you're looking for. In fact, I don't have either of the books Villarrubia has done with Moore, so I'll keep working on that. 

The version I have is a very quality printing and scanning of the Veitch's 'Heartburst and Other Pleasures'. That version is by Alan Moore, Rick Veitch and Steve Bissette. I'll go ahead and up that one, because it's not available right now, and continue to look for the other Moore/Villarrubia books."
