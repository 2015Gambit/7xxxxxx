"Survivers" is a horror game made in Russia that takes the terrifying Slender concept where youΓÇÖre casually walking around the forest searching for pages to collect, only this time around youΓÇÖre being hunted by something else. Something loud and it also features Co-Op mode! The game still in a very early stage of development and might be updated in the near future.

Don't forget to turn up the volume. It'll help! ;)


Mind the misspelled "Survivers" for the game title, it is because the game was made in Russia so im just gonna leave it there as it is.
