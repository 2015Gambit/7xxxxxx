Recorded live in Verona, Naples, and Rome, the Arena Concerto finds the renowned composer conducting the Rome Sinfonietta Orchestra, with several different choirs and some soloists, in a selection of what might be called his greatest hits, starting with his best-known theme in the U.S., the main title music from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Morricone's arrangement is much subtler than the 1968 hit version by Hugo Montenegro, but still identifiable, and it introduces a set of cues from spaghetti westerns, the music that people immediately identify with the composer. But that is only the curtain raiser; Morricone goes on to present some of his most lush melodic themes, notably music from Cinema Paradiso, along with a large chunk of arguably his most ambitious score, The Mission.
