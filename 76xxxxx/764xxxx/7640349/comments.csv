There's really nothing special about any of these Japanese releases except being overpriced..."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-16T21:03Z,"This Jordan is an idiot, the japanese versions have much better dynamics and are original."
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-16T22:24Z,^^^ opinions are like assholes.  Everyone has one.... 
,cybergodsig,2012-09-16T22:58Z,Compare this Japanese version vs. Jordan's remaster and you'll see what I mean.
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-16T23:19Z,listen to the first 20 secs of Don't Kill the Whale and tell me which version sounds like Steve Howe's playing behind a towel...
,cybergodsig,2012-09-17T21:40Z,"Jordan can you be any ruder?  Everytime I put a torrent up, you put a link up to your shit.  Fuck your shit it sucks.  I'm going to see what torrents you have and put the better version up everytime, fuckboy."
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-18T13:09Z,"^^^^ The mentality of a 12 year old.... How mature.

You don't get it.  None of this music is ""yours"".  

When you say something is the ""best"" and I have a different opinion, I'm going to voice it."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-19T22:06Z,jordan is a piece of shit
