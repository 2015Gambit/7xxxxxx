Movie star Tessa Flanagan has retired from the Hollywood grind with a string of popular and critical successes behind her. Now her days revolve around time with her daughter Laya and launching a new career in philanthropy. She doesnΓÇÖt expect a brief encounter with Eleanor Chapin, LayaΓÇÖs new kindergarten teacher, to make a lasting impression.

As the end of the school year nears, however, Tessa realizes that her daughterΓÇÖs beloved Miss Chapin may be the perfect nanny for the summer. Natural and direct, Eleanor already understands LayaΓÇÖs need for life out of the public eye. Even though it means inviting a stranger into their household, Tessa is certain her own carefully guarded secrets will not be at risk.

For Eleanor, L.A. is merely a stop between Boston and a long-awaited Ph.D. program. But the job offer from Tessa Flanagan is so lucrative she is tempted to put her plans on hold. The idea of working closely with Tessa is equally enticing, but the job is about Laya. ThereΓÇÖs no reason not to take itΓÇöafter all, sheΓÇÖll be leaving L.A. soon.
