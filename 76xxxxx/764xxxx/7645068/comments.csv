what in the world are you talking about? the script? this is just wrestling, yes fake. you act like you never seen wrestling before? have you seen Raw on 9-17, he is perfectly fine. you are just really lost or really stupid. CM Punk and Cena been great friends and still are, but in the story they are not...GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!"
