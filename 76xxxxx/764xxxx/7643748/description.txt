Colin Murray presents highlights from the day's Premier League match between Reading and Tottenham, along with all the goals and talking points from Saturday's eight games.

Reading and Tottenham haven't met since the 2007-08 season, when Spurs did the league double over Reading, and also beat them in the FA Cup, albeit after a replay. Those league victories included an astonishing 6-4 win at White Hart Lane, which included four goals from Dimitar Berbatov.
