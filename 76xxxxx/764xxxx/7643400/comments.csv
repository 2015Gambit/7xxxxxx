Thanks Vero for your quick uploads but its hard to watch a singing contest out of sync."

,bdvj,2012-09-19T16:42Z,"Hi verovenlo,

I am a big fan of your uploads of the X(tra) factor uk.
Sadly are the most torrents of season 5,6,7 dead.
Are you still in possession of these seasons of x and xtra factor?
and is there a way to reupload may be?

Sincerely,"
