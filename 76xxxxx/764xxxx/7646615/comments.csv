,bahasniper,2012-09-21T04:25Z,is there any better copy quality sucks :/
[T],samir_ar,2012-09-21T07:44Z,"bahasniper ... first of all, you are welcome. This is currently the best copy available at this time. This is to be expected seeing that the movie premiered in late July. This is a cam version. For a good clean version, you will have to wait some time  until a dvd quality comes around."
