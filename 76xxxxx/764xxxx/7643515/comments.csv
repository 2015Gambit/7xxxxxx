,Lilcrowe,2012-09-23T01:25Z,"Funny how you say it's fake, it's not fake because they got the type of video settings wrong. The movie is the actual movie shown in theaters not so long ago. Just because they said it was a dvd which it wasn't doesn't make it a fake and those who make the FAKE comment like @foobar000 are just making themselves seem sort of mentally inept in other words I'm saying you are making a fool of yourself."
,rcr29budcar,2012-09-23T10:40Z,"Ok! For all you jack asses saying its fake and making complete douche bags out of yourselves....Do you see where it says R6 right after DVD? Do ya?  R6 is a bootleg DVD from China that is pretty much a TS.  So by bootleg standards, this is a great copy, and the best you can get right now!  In case you don't get it, let me explain in simple terms!  It      is     a     real     copy     and     it     is     labeled     correctly!             DVD-R6!       R E T A R D S    "
,cuzeen,2012-09-29T22:17Z,is anyone else having picture with no audio? i tryed a coupkle different players and have no sound. any suggestion? thanks in advance
,Ninjajp,2012-09-30T22:37Z,i need a good copy till the actual release. even bootleg chinese should be more legit than the average TS. 
,dbuck53,2012-10-03T22:20Z,"Region 6 (R6) indicates a distributors dvd release for China, now including Hong Kong. A region 6 dvd should be the same quality as a US region 1.  A TS bootleg of a movie, no matter where it comes from, is not a DVD rip. Ergo ""fake"" is an apt description."
