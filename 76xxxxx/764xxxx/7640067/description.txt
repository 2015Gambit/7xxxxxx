This time Max and Stacy discuss Jamie Dimon's collateral transformation desk feeding the multitude of banksters with five quadrillion in infinitely leveraged toxic derivatives and two Treasury bills of a bankrupt nation. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Joshua Mellors of SocialJusticeFirst.com about financial suicides and the government and banking policies that cause it.
