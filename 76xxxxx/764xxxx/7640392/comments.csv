[V],rr-ne,2012-09-16T06:58Z,Thank you
,kosciusko,2012-09-16T08:17Z,I have enjoyed your previous mp4 videos of the X Factor. Thankyou. However this AVI file seems to be heavily pixelated and not up to your usual standard.
,genwolf,2012-09-16T14:21Z,"yeah heavily pixelated. At least sound in sync this time (so far).

Thankyou though - not as if there are alternatives"
,geoffp,2012-09-16T14:39Z,Wish I'd read the comments before download this - it's as bad as your Xtra factor uploads :-( 
,husn2503,2012-09-16T15:04Z,would love to have mp4 versions all the time.
,jayland,2012-09-17T02:22Z,"Warning !!!...every x factor episode that VeroVenlo has posted this season is out of sync.
Thanks Vero for your quick uploads but its hard to watch a singing contest out of sync. "
