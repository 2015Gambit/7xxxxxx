Super hit movie Aur Ek Takkar (2009) (Telugu Hindi Dub) Synopsis : It is a battle of wits between Dr Raja (Rajeev Kanakala) and Ravi Varma (Allari Naresh) . The two complete strangers meet on train and in that ultimate moment of male bonding, pour out their hearts to each other. While Dr Raja is traumatized because of his alcoholic father, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Ravi Varma wants to get rid of his wife. In fact, they even plot to kill each other's 'troublesome family member' for fun. However, once they reach their destination, they part ways and endeavor to continue with their lives. Destiny does not bring them together till Raja's father is admitted to his hospital after a serious injury. As if this were not enough, he dies after being poisoned. Naturally, all eyes are on Dr Raja as the son who despised his father. On the run, he once again bumps into Ravi Varma. Only this time, he finds out that it is Ravi Varma who has murdered his father and that it is his turn to murder Ravi Varma's wife as they had discussed in that fateful train journey.
