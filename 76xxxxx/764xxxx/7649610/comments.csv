,canopener,2012-09-19T01:35Z,Thx BOZX! Any 1080p versions out/coming soon?
,brussell,2012-09-19T02:36Z,"thank you!
I'm assuming this is the 2D version of this 3D movie?"
,pajretbey,2012-09-20T14:20Z,Its a fucking cartoon... not the movie in theatres right now...
,moo_g_boo,2012-09-20T18:04Z,"@pajretbey Maybe from now on you'll pay attention to the actual title of the movie instead of blindly clicking on the first RE movie you see.

Fucking idiot. Enjoy your shitty Milla Jovovich teenage boy soft porn when you find it."
,odbyd,2012-09-21T07:33Z,"pajretbey This is how suckers end.

great quality of the torrent!"
,ro4eva,2012-09-21T17:30Z,"Pajretbey did you even bother to look at the picture of the Resident Evil Damnation Blu-ray cover?

Anyways, even though it's a cartoon, it's done REALLY well (well, IMO).  If you're a big fan of Resident Evil, I recommend you at least play RE0,1,2,3,CVX,4, 5, Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles and then watch Resident Evil Degeneration (the first cartoon) and then this one (the second cartoon)."
,Color_Harmony,2012-09-21T19:00Z,I actually prefer the Resident Evil movies that are straight from the Capcom studios... And it follows the true Resident Evil story line!

,franky1991,2012-09-22T16:19Z,Subtitles are in Chinese omg

Thanks uploader"
,Cra5h91,2012-09-24T01:05Z,@pajretbey damn you re right! actually this movie and the degeneration before it are the best ones around based on the real game franchise. So just watch it the movies are like cartoons to this one.
,11770,2012-09-24T19:28Z,"for those of you like me who cant read chinese or just plain dont want them there; use vlc media player then video ->subtitles- disable or download this program ;mkvtoolnix:http://www*mediafire*com/?80rfn045at3j4tl, not sure about outside links so if not allowed a mod can remove it. also you dont have to install any .exe just extract it to its own folder and in this case run ""mmg.exe"" the ""*"" are ""."""
