,C1hrisin,2012-09-22T15:56Z,Really good DVD rip not filmed in cinema (actually might be bluray I dont know too well) Downloaded FAST and is only 2.2 GB
,splinter48708,2012-09-22T21:40Z,"A head's up...You might want to take a precaution and disconnect from the Internet before watching this.  As the film has not been released yet, this *may* phone home and you get a nasty email.  Not the fault of the uploader, though as these suckers now can let studios know if they are not where they are supposed to be.  Just a word of advice ;)"
,moondog62001,2012-09-24T14:33Z,Thanks.  Will seed.
,ticl,2012-09-25T04:54Z,Audio is terrible. This must be an R5 rip. Video is OK though.
