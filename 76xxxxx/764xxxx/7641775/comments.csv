,MAD3X,2012-09-19T18:57Z,"I actually got this one to work. I had to try at least 4-5 times before it finally worked. Try rebooting both the pc and playbook. It takes for ever to send it with DDPB. Just leave it there for a while and it should work. I almost gave up also, but it did eventually work for me."
,MAD3X,2012-09-19T19:00Z,It did work for me eventually after many tries. It does take DDPB a long time to load it on the playbook....
