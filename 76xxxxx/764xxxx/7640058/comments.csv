I beg to differ

The 3D in the concerts is excellent, The credits mention 2D to 3D occurred, but that was probably applied to the non concert scenes (similar to the ""Never Say Never"" 3D film with Justin Bieber"

,pjones452,2012-09-19T12:39Z,from what I saw the 3D wasn't worth it. The Avengers was converted but it still looked great.
