This disc was ripped via EAC into a single WAV file (see the accompanying log file), then converted to FLAC (which is how I received it). I then converted the FLAC to WAV via Trader's Little Helper, imported the WAV into Audacity, split the songs into individual tracks, exported each as a separate WAV file, and converted those into FLAC via Trader's Little Helper (in which form I now share them). I also created the md5 checksum via Trader's Little Helper.

Comments (from BootlegZone):

This is the new 'HBNL' source. True intro to "Money" and "Hello Little Girl", possible longer outros to some songs (haven't fully compared). Basically this was one of the 1st dubs from the master edit reel which was possibly used for the bootlegs that came out in the 70s. Though just google this title and you might find out more about this material from other forums. This is as good as it gets though people might argue. Can this source be remastered? Should it?

Beatle people who have heard this already say:
"Get this NOW! It cannot possibly be improved upon. As far as Decca Tapes go, all other issues are now officially obsolete."

"Sounds really good!"

"Congratulations on this! I did some very careful listening to "Like Dreamers Do" from about a half dozen sources and this one not only seems the best, it is amazingly close to the Anthology version."

"Sounds incredible."

"Thank you for this. Finally got a chance to do some in-depth analysis on this, and it is indeed better than what I thought was previously the best source.. Plus, yours is at the correct speed!"
