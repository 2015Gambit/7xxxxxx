OK, but next time try to fulfill ""directions"" I asked for when doing Request (like Which frame-format, file-size and specific Reason why do you ask and not getting torrent someplace else).

And - please, try to step on a brake, because it is you third or fourth request in a month. It is over the top and might ""deplete"" your prospects here."
