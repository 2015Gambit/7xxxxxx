Requirements: all Android versions, supports App2SD
Overview: The ONLY app that allows you to edit and delete records in any SQLite database on your phone. For root users, lists all installed apps which have local internal databases. You can then select an app and edit any of its databases.

Fully integrated with Root Explorer. When browsing files in Root Explorer, selecting a database file automatically launches this app instead of the database viewer that is built into Root Explorer.

Non-root users can browse and edit databases on the SD card.

Data is displayed in a smooth scrollable grid and records can be filtered on any field value.

What's in this version:
v2.0.1
Fixed the start-up FC on some devices. Sorry! Thanks to Ben, Shawn and Victor for your help.
v2.0
Changed the main screen to use swipe-able tabs.
Added Bookmarks and Recent tabs for quick access to regularly accessed databases.
Can now quickly sort records by clicking on a column header.
Added action bar icons for Honeycomb, ICS and JellyBean devices.
Improved stability when returning to the app during multi-tasking.
Fixed lock-ups when selecting apps containing lots of local files.
