But before she and her best friend Tiny (Kelli Giddish of ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'') can split the loot and start a new life, they'll have to find the money, dispose of a dead body,distract the nosy sheriff (Ray Liotta) and outsmart a persistent private investigator (Wayne Duvall of O Brother, Where Art Thou?). Richard Riehle (Office Space) co-stars in this pitch-black comedy/thriller about nasty double-crosses, bloody doublewides, and a whole bunch of unexpected twists that will leave you Breathless.....
