,Oblivilot,2012-09-18T06:03Z,"Looks great, works great - for everyone in the US, this doesn't hit the air until Jan.6, 2013!"
,gc04,2012-09-18T17:14Z,"if you cant play this, make sure you have ""VLC player"" and/or the latest codecs installed.. .mkv is an oddball (but very efficient!) codec that needs a specialized player

thank you so much for the up! would hate to have to wait 4 months for PBS to air this."
