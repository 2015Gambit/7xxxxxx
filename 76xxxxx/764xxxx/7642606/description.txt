All are US iBook ePubs converted to ePub, Mobi, and AZW3. Yes, I converted an ePub into ePub so that if added to Calibre all the metadata would be attached without having to do it yourself. Though the description has Prey on Patmos: An Aegean Prophecy as the 3rd book in the Series, Prey on Patmos was dropped in favor of just An Aegean Prophecy for US Release. I've read Murder in Mykonos and it is an AMAZING story. The rich, detailed descriptions of Greece and the outlying islands claimed by them give you a vivid picture to plant as you read.
