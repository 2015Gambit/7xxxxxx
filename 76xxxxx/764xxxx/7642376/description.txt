David Tennant's Comedy World Cup 1x01
Channel 4

David Tennant hosts the competition to determine which of
Britain's comedians have the biggest fountain of funny
knowledge. Each team is made up of three comedians: a
team captain in their 30s or 40s, an over-50 comedy
legend, and a relative comedy newbie in their 20s or 30s.

Team captains featuring during the series include Alan Carr,
Andy Parsons, Phill Jupitus, Omid Djalili, Johnny Vegas and
Micky Flanagan. At the end of the series the final two teams
go head-to-head, with one team crowned winners of the Comedy
World Cup 2012.
