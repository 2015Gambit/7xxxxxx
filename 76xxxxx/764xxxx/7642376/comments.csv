That's how many references to American comedy I counted in this one, and two of them were Simpsons-related.  I think the British comedians missed all of the answers on them - except for ID-ing the ""Cheers"" theme song as early 80's.  If you're an American who's watched Monty Python and some of the other Brit stuff that's come available over here, you might have better luck - but I doubt they'd still get more than 30% enjoyment out of this show."
