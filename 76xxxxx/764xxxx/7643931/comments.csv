Ya then we got the assholes complaining on not enough seeders when its doesn't take that long to seed this torrent for a day but i guess people are just that greedy now days so its not my fault, i have 100gb uploaded so if there not seeding i really can't do anything about that, but those who want to seed this please do thanks"
