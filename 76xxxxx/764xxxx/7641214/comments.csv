So we were overjoyed to find Aug 15--of the right year--posted here last month.

Sad to say, the bullshitters are back in business relocated to TPB. To find this out, you don't need to ""restart the application""; just check the date modified in the get info window.

This KCN, like the other ""Sept"" issue uploaded to TPB, is Aug 15, 2011."
