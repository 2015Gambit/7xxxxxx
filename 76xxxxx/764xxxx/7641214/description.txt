This is the KCNcrew Pack September 15 2012 Issue. 

It's like Serial Box, which has SN's, cracks and patches. It would be best to have both of these collections, as this Pack often has serials you cannot find in the SBox.

Unlike SBox, no readers are required. Just open the dmg file, drag and drop the app where you like.
