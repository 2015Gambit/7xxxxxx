	Some call methamphetamine the "Devil's Drug." Often made in less
than an hour from a common cold remedy, this powerful stimulant is
sweeping across the U.S. and Asia. Follow a raid on a suspected meth
lab, stake out a neighborhood pharmacy where addicts attempt to
accumulate cold and flu pills, and meet a neuroscientist urgently
searching for a cure for addiction. See the dangers of meth and the
unexpected physical damages caused by the drug.
