thx

Encode:

Finally a nice audio and video came up for that Entertainment Movie.
The Russian DVD was ok just the colours were off a lot, all is yellowish and blue is grey. (and the weird pink umbrella)
Tried couple things with the video but there was no way doing the complete movie with one coloursettings.
Dancing Scenes and Scenes at daylight differed a lot, so i had no other choice than to split the movie in parts and treat every part with different colour settings.
Kept me busy for 2 nights, but finally got there with a decent video.

Apart from that, did the usual, brightness,sharpness and denoise

For the Audio, first i wanted to use adtrg line which was nice, cleaned that up nicely, just when i was ready the resistance track got out, which was much clearer.
So i used that track, cleaned that up too, removed voice from the russian 5.1 track and entered the cleaned track into the russian one to get some nice music effects.

also answering here the first question right upfront, before it will popup about the runtime:
both adtrg and resistance version had 24 frames(??), every russian dvd has 25 frames as usual so why change that
So i had to resync audio to the dvd again, hence the runtime is different, nothing is missing.

all in all still got very nice, and will do till the bluray comes around
enjoy
