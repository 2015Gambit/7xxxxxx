Plot:


The new 3D stop-motion comedy thriller from animation company LAIKA, 
reteaming the company with Focus Features after the groundbreaking 
Academy Award-nominated Coraline. ParaNorman is, following Coraline, 
the company's second stop-motion animated feature to be made in 3D. 
In ParaNorman, a small town comes under siege by zombies. Who can it 
call? Only misunderstood local boy Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is 
able to speak with the dead. In addition to the zombies, he'll have 
to take on ghosts, witches and, worst, of all, grown-ups, to save his 
town from a centuries-old curse. But this young ghoul whisperer may 
find his paranormal activities pushed to their otherworldly limits
