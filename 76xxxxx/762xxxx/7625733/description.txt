Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, Alex covers the current state of the movement and continuing efforts by the establishment and its subservient corporate media to push the official and widely debunked narrative of what happened on that day and who is responsible. 

Alex also confronts the threat posed by InfraGard, the dangerous "public-private partnership" shock troops spawned by the FBI. 

Alex covers other important news, including the FBI's claim that hackers did not steal the personal identification data on millions of Apple device owners from an agent's laptop and the FBI grilling of a 16-year-old after he posted a Youtube video.
