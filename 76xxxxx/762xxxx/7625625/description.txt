If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: Android 2.3+
Overview: This is the first Nintendo DS emulator for Android with a dynarec. 


Right now the NDS emulator is in beta so there are many bugs and it runs slow. However, I'll try and update it frequently so it gets much better!
Please email me if you have any problems. I can't really fix bugs if you just post a 1 star review saying it crashes.
Other functions to be added
-Save States
Save files do work however. So you can save during the in
save points, but you can't pause the game and create a
save state
-Microphone
-Sound

Based off of desmume and exophase's dynarec

What's in this version:
Sound and multitouch fix
