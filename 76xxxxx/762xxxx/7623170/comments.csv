,topeak,2012-09-12T11:22Z,"Ok, this is for all the fucking morons out there:

No, this isn't fucking Dark Knight Rises. It's part 1 of a 2 part adaptation of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, which pretty much kicked comics in the balls back in the 80's. 

Yes, this is Part 1 of 2, because it's a long fucking story, and to tell it all decently they had to split this shit up into two parts. Part 2 is coming later. Did you all bitch this much when you found out The Hobbit was going to be split up or what? 

As for the DL itself:
A:10
V:10
For a DVDRip anyway. It's not bluray, or HD, or fuck else. If you need that, just wait a day or two and I'm sure it'll show up. 

There, that's all any of you need to know. Oh wait, one last thing: Michael Fucking Ironside is the voice of Batman, and he's perfect for this role. Now shut the fuck up, and either download it, or don't. If you do download it, seed, and thank the originally uploaded. "
,fibernachi,2012-09-12T11:42Z,"shit people i can't bealive the stupid ass comments i'm reading here! so i want in to !
 THIS IS MY STUPID ASS COMMENT!
HAHAHA...."
,gekfoot,2012-09-12T12:44Z,"WARNING: This is not the kick-ass Batman movie you were hoping for. 

It is the virgins-only version that is absolutely terrible horse shit but will be praised by hipster losers because it's obscure, unlike the real batman movie we were all hoping this would be.

If people don't avoid you or refer to you as 'that creepy kid' then you don't bother wasting your bandwidth on this piece of shit.

M: -1/10"

,Discontinue,2012-09-12T13:30Z,"Why does Batman always appear to be so FAT in the animated versions?? lol.  
Great quality, thanks for the up!"
,BigTDrift,2012-09-12T14:03Z,"I finally registered after coming here for years just so I could comment about this (And the other comments).

No it's not the Nolan movie.  That's not due out on DVD/Blu-ray til December, thus prolly not a scene release til mid to late November.

I, for one was looking forward to this more than the Nolan one anyway.   It is not a comic book and not anime.  It is animation based on a great comic series.
I do not live in a basement.  I have a good Job, Good wife and kids, good house, good friends.  All you haters out there need to grow up a bit.  Either mentally or physically.  Animation is not just for kids and dorks.  It can sometimes provide a much more engaging and emotional story than any live action movie ever could.  All of  the DC animated movies from the past few years have been outstanding.  I absolutely hated everything from the DC universe until the superman Doomsday movie a few years ago.

Anyway, Thanks for the up."
,isinaipodda21,2012-09-12T15:15Z,"either way it is.. it's still awesome.. read the title well bitches!! it says ""returns"".. not 'rises"".. dillholes!!"
,Zanteater,2012-09-12T19:18Z,"People are focusing too much on the haters of this because its not the fucking Nolan movie.

Heres my take on it:

Scene4all did NOT upload this thinking it was the Nolan movie, he specifically chose this for people like ME and everyone else who actually WANTED this!

Stop worrying about all the fuck ups who thought it was the movie, instead read their comments AND LAUGH AT HOW FUCKING STUPID THEY ARE.

Troll the earth and your life will be full of entertainment.

Thanks yet again scene4all "
,ProphetZarquon,2012-09-12T21:18Z,"Wow, amazing how many people are able to Write comments even though they obviously can't read.

THIS IS NOT THE LIVE ACTION BATMAN MOVIE
That is called The Dark Knight Rises
THIS IS AN ANIMATED FEATURE FILM
This is called The Dark Knight Returns

It is not for little kids, but it is a PG13 movie.

FYI, IMDB rating: 8.4/10 from 646 users

Some people just don't like animated films, or haven't seen any they liked.  This movie is pretty good, but it probably isn't going to change that.

Seriously, I don't know how the uploader could have made this any more obvious:

The name is different.
It says Part 1 - Rises is not split into two parts.
It's a DVDRip - Rises won't be out on DVD anywhere for at least a month.
The cover art is completely different and obviously drawn, not photographed.

It even says DC Universe Animated Original Movie right on the cover art.

If you like DC comics, you'll probably like this movie.
If you like any of the darker Batman animated series, you'll probably like this movie.
If you hate cartoons and you thought this was going to be The Dark Knight Rises, well, you're an idiot and you'll probably be disappointed many more times in your life, so get used to it.

V: 7
It's animated, even for XviD, this should look a little better at 800mb...
A: 9
Audible and MOSTLY reasonable dynamic range, better than 90% of films!
M: 6.5
Better than most animated stuff.  Not as good as some of the other Batman cartoons I've seen.  A lot of stupid poorly drawn hair and lame villain art.  It's a Warner production, so it was predictably childish.

Reminds me a bit of Batman Beyond, both in artistic style (though less ""noir"") and in concept."
,seednope,2012-09-13T04:13Z,OMG I can't believe those people got killed because of a cartoon!?!  WTF
,ProphetZarquon,2012-09-13T04:24Z,"@seednope

,steaz55,2012-09-13T04:26Z,If people would only look at the screenshots and shut the fuck up.

A:10, except for the sneak peek at The Dark Knight Returns Part 2. There was no audio whatsoever.

Awesome movie. I've been waiting for this since i first finished the graphic novel.
Bummer that Kevin Conroy didnt voice Bats, But Robocop did a decent job."
,h_skelter9,2012-09-13T07:33Z,bigTDrift WTF! who d fuck cares about ur personal data sheet..nobody gives a shit about u.. just thank d uploader..download wat u want& get d fuck outta hr

,PigLARP,2012-09-13T08:02Z,"Great quality for both A/V, Movie was really good and worth a watch to anyone that's a Batman fan."
,obelisktorment,2012-09-13T11:22Z,"Okay.. oh my damn, what the fuck people! Apparently no one has concepts that The Dark Knight Returns comes from a Graphic Novel.

This is not the Christian Bale movie, it's animated. No one got shot because of this. People got shot because one psychotic fucktard chose to go on a killing spree. I feel horrible for those people who just wanted to watch The Dark Knight Rises. This howerver is not that movie!

Thank you to whoever U/L'd this, I didn't have the luxury of reading this Graphic Novel but a friend told me about it and when I saw it was going to be an animated version, I was happy.

Read before you post, all I'm gonna say!"
,mcrowley,2012-09-13T11:58Z,"I clicked this link just to see how many dumb bastards had to complain about this not being The Dark Knight Rises.  Predictable.  Hilarious.  But kinda sad.  People are fucking stupid.

,nobodynever,2012-09-13T18:45Z,"I thought Ben Linus was going to be the Joker in this.  He has like one line in the last fifteen seconds of the film.  And yes there is no audio for everything after the movie (not the movie its self, that was fine). "
