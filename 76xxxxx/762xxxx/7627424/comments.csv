,shane3900,2012-09-14T16:15Z,definately NOT 1080p. would only be a dvdrip. look at file size 1.8 gb.
,shane3900,2012-09-15T08:30Z,"hey yify, how about uploading some REAL 1080's. you know files 7gb and above. that way they may have some detail to the movies and make audio dts and ac3 instead of crappy mp4 sound."
