,autoblank,2012-09-11T07:53Z,"Man, thanks a million for all your wonderful torrents so far! Where do you even get these obscure comics? I've never even heard of this one from Enki Bilal! THANKS! You are a true collector!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-11T08:05Z,"Hey thanks for the kind words autoblank, and you're most welcome. 

Regarding this comic book, yeah, I think the reason it's not as widely known is probably because it's an early one and the interior is b&w. But I read it and I enjoyed it. 

In regards to where I got all these books, people keep asking that and I can't really give a clear answer. They've come from a number of different places, including my own collection. The reason why I have the stuff I have is just because these are the kinds of books I like. I like the weird, underground, independent and alternative stuff. Been into it since the early 80s, so when I started collecting books digitally I went after the same stuff.

,autoblank,2012-09-11T09:33Z,"Wow, you're awesome mate! I wished more people would get into reading indie and foreign comics instead of the usual mainstream fare of superheroes and manga, because so many of these underground and obscure stuff are just incredible and thought provoking. 

LOL, I'm quickly running out of disk space just from your torrents. But hey, they're all very, very much appreciated! You're even dedicated to restoring the older comics, and that is something I really respect.

Many cheers!! :D"

Any chance you have Satan's Tears by Alex Nino?"
