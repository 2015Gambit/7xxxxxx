Synopsis - A Jewish man has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use 
that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp.

Found a raw Blu Ray source believe it or not. Compressed it down to 720p, cut the audio down 
to stereo 96k, and hardcoded the English subtitles.

any comments or critiques. If you have something you would like done, please suggest it. And 
if it's something I would like in my collection, maybe I will add it.
