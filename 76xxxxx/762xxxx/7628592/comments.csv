Thanks dellefs0.

Do you think you can compress this 19GB Russian classic down to around a couple of gigs?

I did not expect such speed!  I'm downloading your version of ""Andrei Rublev"" now. It'll probably take me longer to download than it took you to encode. I'll grade the quality on its own post site when I get a chance to see it. I'm sure it'll be A10, V10. Thank you again."
