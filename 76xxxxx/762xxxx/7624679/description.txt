Melissa Harris-Perry; Sunday, September 9, 2012.

Sunday, MHP and her guests looked at power from a number of perspectives. First, they introduced the latest edition of This Week in Voter Suppression!^[TM] (they're about to trademark that), digging through the fine print of Pennsylvania's voter-ID legislation. Then they looked at how power is used in actual governance, from domestic to foreign policy. And as the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks approaches this week, they examined the power of violence and terrorism in our lives, and how the definitions of those words have changed since that horrible day. Lastly, Melissa ended the show with a hopeful Footnote which you don't want to miss.
