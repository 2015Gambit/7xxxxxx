I mean the avatar located just beside my name on the scoreboard, i successfully change my name and clan tag as what installed, but regarding avatar photo, I have no way to change it."

No, steam must be off when game start.

Copy any .jpg or .png files to /platform dir and rename picture-file to avatar.dat"
