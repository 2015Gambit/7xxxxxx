You are welcome to waste your time here as much as you want...

Recent events in Libya where an enraged fanatic muslim mob murdered several people at the US embassy show they are following their evil prophet's footsteps. In the West nobody would dream of such acts because of fun being poked at any religious book or character. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE between fanatic and liberal attitudes.

And the so-called Muslims who are angrily banning it on the same media that produced the movie? Don't they see the futility in it? Anyway, thanks for the upload if not fr the opportunity to at leat review the information and make my own opinion."

I was also looking for it but couldn't find it. This is the closest I could get and I think the other one couldn't be very different. The point is showing through their own religious writings what bastards these muslims are and how they deceive themselves and try to deceive others that they are a 'proper' religion wen in fact, they are fanatic, oppressive, intolerant, male-chauvinistic backward people whose religion would collapse the moment they allowed freedom to leave it.

The muslim texts cited in the these movies are not invented, they are taken from your own unholy religion, so if you want to ignore all that and continue to believe in Muhammad's concoctions, it's up to you, but no muslim can deny that they belong to a murderous religion that denies personal freedom, the only that kills people who are born or converted into it and then change their mind. What is happening in the world now shows the real nature of your evil and hateful religion.

I'll write this in capitals just to emphasize and call 
attention, because I think this is very important:

ONCE I WATCHED A DEBATE BETWEEN MUSLIM 
PROMINENT PEOPLE AND ATHEISTS. ONE OF THE 
MUSLIMS STARTED TO GET ANGRY AND TALK IN 
A LOUD VOICE, BUT HAD THE TREMENDOUS CHEEK 
TO ACCUSE THE ATHEISTS, WHO WERE QUIETLY 
EXPLAINING THEIR POINTS, OF BEING EMOTIONAL 
AND ANGRY PEOPLE !!!!

IT IS CLEAR THAT BEING MUSLIMS SO USED TO LIE 
TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS, OUT OF FEAR,  
SINCE IF THEY EXPRESSED ANY DOUBTS ABOUT 
THEIR RELIGION IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES THEY 
COULD GO TO PRISON OR BE KILLED, THAT THEY 
**LIE NATURALLY**, WITHOUT ANY FEELINGS OF 
GUILT OR SHAME.

SO THEY ACCUSE THOSE WHO EXPOSE ISLAM FOR 
WHAT IS TS, OF BEING UNEDUCATED, EVIL, JEWS, 
IGNORANT OF ISLAM, ETC., ALTHOUGH THEY ARE 
QUOTING TEXTS FROM THEIR OWN EVIL RELIGION
AND SHOWING THE BACKWARDNESS AND STUPIDITY 
OF THEIR INVENTED GOD, ALLAH, AND THEIR PROPHET.

IT'S SO SAD AND EVIDENT, THAT IF MUSLIM COUNTRIES
EVER BECOME DEMOCRATIC, WITH PERSONAL FREEDOM, 
THE ISLAMIC RELIGION, BASED ON FEAR AND IGNORANCE, 
WILL COLLAPSE LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS...

,raenkae,2012-09-14T13:30Z,"sakstroy: Im for criticism of Islam. The religious zealots of that religion have done nothing to convince me of its legimitacy, and the falsification they do to the history is discusting, but

I dont think any decent humans on this Earth will gain anything by making ""muslims"" as a group into victims. That plays only into the hands of the imams and other powerful men (always men) of the Islam theocracy. They want an unified ""muslim"" world so they can rule over it. They are planting missinformation about ""colonialism"" and breeding christophobia in all ""muslim"" countries. Christians are getting killed all over the ""muslim world"", just so that aristocracy of Islam can gain more power over the ""sheeps""

Whatever your reasons are to bash Islam, the right way is by using real facts and grow self awareness, tolerance and national pride among all the peoples that the arab muslims conquered and subdued! An arabian God? It is as mad as an ""jewish"" God (YAHWE) in my opinion!

Arabs are not the master race. In my humble opinion we are all equal!"
,raenkae,2012-09-14T13:58Z,"wasifmehmood: Did you know your fathers father?

Maybe you are persian? What do I know? If you for example did come from Persia your ancestors were NOT muslims, but zoroastrians and worshipped Ahura Mazda which were an very large religion before the muslim zealots conquered the then weakened Sassanid Empire. If you come from Egypt your ancestors were coptic christians, and before that worshipped the panteon of the egyptian gods. I can go on an name countless of other interesting cultures that have been conquered, subdued and enslaved by the islamic theocracy.

To say that you shall follow the foolishness of your fathers are just hypocracy, and makes you as foolish as them!

Lets say that a man with power and money says that he is a prophet, without witnesses. He use his influence and power to gain more followers and then inspired by other monoteistic religions in the area decides to get rid of the panteon of gods that his own tribe controls except one of the many gods and goddesses. The followers decide to write an book after his death and they decide to be claiming it was written by ""God"". They conquer, pillage and plunder until several miljons are subdued. This is what you believe in! The claim of just ONE MAN to be the ""messenger of the god Allah""

Oh man is easily fooled!"

I've taken the trouble to read the Quran and listen to muslim scholars talking and writing about many subjects.

Although I've found that people from all religions write ridiculous things based on their beliefs, in the case of muslims ir reaches absurd levels. At least neither in the christian bible or the jewish torah or buda writings it doesn't say like in the Quran that the sun every night sets into a 'murky pond'... It's an ignorant religion that produces ignorant and fanatic people, intolerant and murderous and people who hate personal freedom, because with it, without fear of death, their followers would soon leave it and that religion would collapse.

Let's help those among them who use their brains to consider the origins and nature of islam so they can get out in time, before they kill someone or made some woman's life hell on earth.

Current events in the muslim world show them for what they are: murderous fanatics whose governments keep quiet and condone their evil doings. They can conceive people can dislike their religion with good reasons.

,sunnyfatrix,2012-09-24T21:13Z,is this Movie Insulting Prophet Muhammad????
,sakstroy,2012-09-25T09:34Z,"
I don't understand you. If someone says that Jesus was favourable to Roman oppression of Palestine in his time, or that he was soft and spoke in favour of prostitutes at the time, that is no insult but statements based on facts as written in the christian gospels. 

Saying like these movies say that Muhammad was responsible for the murder of many people or that he married a nine year old girl after ogling her at age six, those are horrible things for anyone today, but muslims in the fanatic and brutal attitude demand that we don't say that and if we do, threaten people with violence.

THAT is a wrong and unacceptable attitude we should not tolerate in the west or anywhere, because any person in the past or present who did or does questionable things, should be denounced and free to do so.

Muslim brutal intolerance in this respect should be confronted firmly and deny them the 'right' to do violence as a result.

Is it clear to you now?

I know muslims come from countries where personal freedom is unknown, but that will change in the future, whether you like it or not...
