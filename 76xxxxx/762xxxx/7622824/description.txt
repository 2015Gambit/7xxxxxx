Marillion are one of the UK music sceneΓÇÖs best kept secrets; purveyors of soulful, powerful, and often deeply-moving music, with a long-standing reputation for blistering live shows which have earned them an impressive and faithful global fanbase.
[Notes]: This is a peer2peer leak using Scene rules rip (Lame 3.98.4 with v0 preset) and September 17, 2012 is the release date for their new album. Also, Some of the tracks are very long (over 10 minutes), thus the filesize. Have a good one.
Description: With Sounds That CanΓÇÖt Be Made, Marillion continue their successful musical journey. The 17th studio album is as soulful and powerful as ever, including 8 brand new songs. Recorded at Racket studio in England, the album echoes the great layered sound of albums like Marbles and Afraid of Sunlight, all that Marillion fans hope to hear on a new record. Songs like Gaza and Montreal show once more, that epic progressive songwriting can speak the musical language of the new millennium. Power and Lucky Man remind us that pop-rock music can also be powerful and deep.
The new album cover has been designed by Simon Ward while the booklet will feature the contribution of artists including Antonio Seijas, Andy Wright, Carl Glover and Marc Bessant.
