,CptKlink,2012-09-12T18:01Z,I don't see it as a stolen release as you can see he even put the origional relese group name in the torrents title and also its a re-encode which means they are just trying to make a release better with the sources they have
,superfido1,2012-09-12T20:19Z,"Well, how is it?"
,buddhistmom,2012-09-13T04:56Z,It was a nice try and thanks for it but it was just too dark to watch :)
,ChasUGC,2012-09-16T03:28Z,"It's funny how pirates are calling those who upload the pirated movie a thief. And, then those who pirate the pirated movie are calling the uploaders thieves. It's confounding.

You can't steal something that has already been stolen. ""Officer, he stole my stolen painting.""

Doesn't make a bit of sense."
