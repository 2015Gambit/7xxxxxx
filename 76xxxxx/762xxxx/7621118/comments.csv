,tbraybrook,2012-09-14T02:59Z,I download a lot of torrents but am new and uploading torrents and sharing them. I am uploading(seeding) this torrent at Unlimited. Why if I have the upload limit and download limit at Unlimited would it only show presently an upload speed of about 12? Normally it shows higher but only shows 12 now. I even had my bandwidth at high but put it to normal. I am using uTorrent.

Some ISP are known to be not torrent-friendly.

Anyway, love the upload. Great many thanks!"

You could be right about the ISP but don't think that is it if they let me download super fast.
Glad you like the upload."
