Customer Centric Selling by Michael T. Bosworth and John R. Holland

The Web has changed the game for your customersΓÇö and, therefore, for you. Now, CustomerCentric Selling, already recognized as one of the premier methodologies for managing the buyer-seller relationship, helps you level the playing field so you can reach clients when they are ready to buy and create a superior customer experience.

Your business and its people need to be ΓÇ£CustomerCentricΓÇ¥ΓÇöwilling and able to identify and serve customersΓÇÖ needs in a world where competition waits just a mouse-click away. Traditional wisdom has long held that selling means convincing and persuading buyers. But todayΓÇÖs buyers no longer want or need to be sold in traditional ways.

CustomerCentric Selling gives you mastery of the crucial eight aspects of communicating with todayΓÇÖs clients to achieve optimal results:

    Having conversations instead of making presentations
    Asking relevant questions instead of offering opinions
    Focusing on solutions and not only relationships
    Targeting businesspeople instead of gravitating toward users
    Relating product usage instead of relying on features
    Competing to winΓÇönot just to stay busy
    Closing on the buyerΓÇÖs timeline (instead of yours)
    Empowering buyers instead of trying to ΓÇ£sellΓÇ¥ them

WhatΓÇÖs more, CustomerCentric Selling teaches and reinforces key tactics that will make the most of your organizationΓÇÖs resources. Perhaps you feel you donΓÇÖt have the smartest internal systems in place to ensure an ideal workflow. (Perhaps, as is all too common, you lack identifiable systems almost entirely.) From the basicsΓÇöand beyondΓÇöof strategic budgeting and negotiation to assessing and developing the skills of your sales force, youΓÇÖll learn how to make sure that each step your business takes is the right one.
