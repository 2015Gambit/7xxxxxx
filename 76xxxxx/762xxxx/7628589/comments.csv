,AquaticLightning,2012-09-18T05:40Z,"Could you please upload Batman #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, and #12? It's a lot to ask for, I know, but you're the best at keeping up with these comics. Also, only if it's not a problem. If any issues arise, then by all means, you don't have to. Thankyou if you could!"
