Then why comment and rate the movie? 

Seriously, what's wrong with you people? If you don't like it, don't watch it. As simple as that."
,relu22,2012-09-14T19:15Z,"very good movie, thanks a lot man, you did good job"
,luisbaeta,2012-09-14T19:50Z,"A/V 9/8 the sound is low but acceptable, you will need to up the sound. Anyway this isnÂ´t the avengers so the sound is not the most importante. Want to have a great night of sex with your girlfriend or wife, then I highly recomend you showing them this movie the chicks REALLY dig it."
,K_Ranger,2012-09-15T02:53Z,"V/8 
A/4

Color is washed out.
Sound is very hollow. Need to turn volume up a lot to hear most of the speaking scenes. 

As for the movie itself, pretty horrible.  I can appreciate a good looking dude and all, but not even the eye-candy factor made the story worth sitting through.  Definitely just made to showcase these guys bodies and dancing and all that, not meant to be any kind of story. So chicks and gay dudes and dudes who aren't insecure in their own sexuality, watch it for the dudes if you want, but there's really no story here worth focusing on.  And to all those who have to hate and go on about fags and homos, ets.  Remember this - We hate in others what we fear most about ourselves.  So you go off on the gay people, pretty much says that you're one yourself, just too afraid to admit it.  So seal with it, freaks.  "

Fantastic job!!!"
,jayrockskee,2012-09-16T06:36Z,"So if I watch this entire thing without it moving, am I straight, or will I wish I was gay for 20 minutes and turn it off? 

I mean these are some really good looking guys, but I'm not into dudes, so what's the point? Is there a deep life lesson I will take away from this? Will I be doing pushups after the movie? Learning some new homo-erotic dance moves?

I noticed that Es2Kay is on her period and really is behind this movie. 

@Es2Kay: So how fat are you? How many times did you pause this movie to have another orgasm? If it's more than 5x I won't even bother."
,KKKDownlow,2012-09-16T18:31Z,Any male that watches this is definitely gay just like those that sat through Humpback I mean Brokeback Mountain. lol
,noomin,2012-09-17T12:01Z,"@jayrockskee, sorry dude, no deep life lesson to be learnt here, just alot of penis.............and you took the words right out of my mouth with Es2Kay mate, the chick was getting pretty worked up defending this peice of shit, probably couldn't even call it a movie and I think my 6yr old could write a better script about the dog shit on the bottom of her shoe. I would probably rather nail my eyelids to the ceiling than watch this again. So here's my rating: Dont waste your time. Instead get the fuck off your couches you lazy bitches and go out and watch a live male strip show if your really that desperate. I'm talking to you there Es2Kay, wink wink, nudge nudge!! "
,paolofabri,2012-09-17T19:09Z,"The reason you homophobes exist is because you don't know what to do the erection in your pants when you were watching this. Why watch this movie if you are so against it, fucking geeks."
,Glenn_K9,2012-09-17T19:37Z,"I must say for an R5 this was pretty good quality.  
So I'm rating based on the R5 format:

V-9
A-9
M-6

I was disappointed in the story line, I thought there would be something in this that grabs you, other then the fleshy hot guy stuff sorry but lost respect for these actors I really expected more.  If you are interested in just hot fleshy men then go for it but don't expect more."
,samy007,2012-09-17T21:06Z,"Pretty good copy considering the date of this upload. Thanks !

I liked this movie and I would like to give another point of view about it (this is still a Verhoeven movie !):

Try to compare this film to American Beauty. The storyline about the male strip club is a mere excuse to dress a metaphorical landscape about two generations of american youth. The guy who reaches his thirties (channing tatum) and the young one who is just starting in his twenties.

Both of them are struggling with economical pressure, moral dilemmas, culture and history gaps, and general confusion about ""What to do with their life ? What about posterity ? And what does work mean when you want more than money ?""
The strip club is a way to artificially emulate very intense experiences about drugs, money, success, and moral dilemmas in a limited time period (or camera time...). 
At the end the director does not serve you with a moral lesson: he shows you two different choices, and leaves you with your side of the story.


This may not be a ""master piece"", but this is a very entertaining movie that gives you a special glimpse about today's youth.
Plus: very impressive scenes of stripping that will please anyone hungry for perfect chocolate abs !
I recommend.

"
,noomin,2012-09-19T02:48Z,"@samy007 Yeah, when you put it that way I guess you're right. But fuck, you'd have to look pretty damn hard for that conclusion. I honestly think it was made because of the fact Channing Tatum was once a stripper and they built up a story around that, knowing full well that bitches are gonna love it and then milk them clean of their $$$$$. 
Btw, @paolofabri, I'm a bisexual adult woman, I have gay family and gay friends. I appreciate a good looking man as much as a good looking woman. I love a good movie too. This one just didnt do it for me, and just because I think its a shit movie doesnt make me a homophobe. So calm the fuck down you fuzzy little manpeach.  "

,Savre,2012-09-23T04:04Z,"Strange how I actually liked this film. The two leads have pretty good chemistry and the love interest is actually really good actress and is cute in her own way. It also has a good story that I think most people can relate too. None of us wants to end up in a dead end. 

Not what I expected which is why I liked it.

Ideally if you're promoting the idea of ""Anonymous"" which this site may be doing directly or indirectly, you must value and respect others without the blatant personal attacks.  *Understandng the concept of Anonymous means that you understand that -every- person matters and is wholly valuable, sans bias.
