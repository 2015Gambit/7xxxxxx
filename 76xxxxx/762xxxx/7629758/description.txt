The Kinks - One for the Road 2010 [MP3@320](oan)

If you only know the Kinks for the hits (as I did) this album is a good introduction 
to some of their latter work in the 80's. The live album is well produced and has a 
good vibe to it. I've had live albums in the past where the band has sounded very 
lackluster and you wonder why they bothered. However here Ray and Dave are on fine 
form and the gig takes on a punkier/hard rock feel as they blast their way through 
songs.
