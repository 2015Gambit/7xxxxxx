Just keep your torrent running after it has finished. It seeds on its own."

,Kataron,2012-09-12T07:03Z,"Awesome. Didn't even know they were doing another animated one! Marvel may have a better track record for the live action superhero movies (with obvious exceptions), but DC can really rock an animated film.

Thanks, Extremezone!"
,mighty_zeus,2012-09-12T07:04Z,My point being... do you know how many people will download this thinking it's the movie?
,shablah,2012-09-12T07:17Z,"What Batman movie is called ""The Dark Knight Returns""? if you downloaded this thinking it was the 1992 movie you could almost be forgiven. Good work like usual EZ!"
,phaaiza,2012-09-12T10:28Z,"its ez it must be great ill tell after downloading just for new comers here

,darkangel86,2012-09-12T20:53Z,"It is supposed to be released Sept 25! Bless you, I may just by the DVD so they will continue making DC animated movies, the best thing DC ever did (live action..not so much)."

,yousef86,2012-09-15T17:53Z,"Excellent Quality DVD Rip! A/10 V/10!

piratepedia Earns My +1 of Approval!"
,samoantree,2012-09-18T08:16Z,Never ceases to amaze me how many retarded people there are in the world. The movie you idiots are looking for is the Dark Knight Rises. One look at the DVD cover and you could tell this was a cartoon.
,andre.amir,2012-09-18T09:51Z,"Awesome!! Thanks Extremezone! *to everyone else, download this only if you're a fan. Cause if you are, then you SHOULD KNOW that this is the animated feature of Dark Knight that comes in 2 parts; adapting the 4-issue comic of the same name from 1986. THIS IS NOT the Live Action movie."
,faizaan10,2012-09-19T04:56Z,:D
,Romeo1983,2012-09-19T20:35Z,So this is the movie that connects Batman to Batman Beyond?? 
,M3TALxSLUG,2012-09-22T03:00Z,"wow, most of you are idots. yes its a cartoon and yes its a full length movie!! ever herd of google or imdb? do a little homework before you get all pissed off about this not bing ""The Dark Knight Rises"" plus, doesnt the animatd image up top show damn well its not live acton? this movie has been advertized all over he net and tv so fck off if youwere dub enough to thnk it was anythingother than what it is. great torrnt btw."
,Lyxnman,2012-09-23T23:46Z,"My quick summary:
The adaption of the 1986 4 issue mini series, which has been collected as a graphic novel form. This is the story that changed batman in the world, for better or worse. This TRULY re-grounded him after years of being a space adventure who wore technicolor suits to fit the day of the week. Bruce retired after the death of the Second Robin, Jason Todd(the one not brought into any animated SERIES to date, due to the death of his character being a large part of why the third robin was brought in).The graphic novel depicts a lot of elements Nolan would use in Dark Knight Rises, such as an intercity war between the gangs and the people of Gotham, and a pair of fights between Bruce and a bad guy that first Bruce badly loses, then the second time around wins in a vicious beat down. 

While it is animated, this movie is probably dark and realistic batman tale ever written made into movie form."
,Lyxnman,2012-09-24T01:09Z,"A few elements you need to know about before watching this with your child: there are very violent acts of murder either shown or talked about(including a few nuns and childern), one case of an off screen suicide, and sexual slang tossed toward a 13 year old (""Chicken legs"" when the mutants talk to Carrie). Batman fallout even kills a few people."
,stijr,2012-09-29T15:42Z,thank you man!! a ton motherfuckAAA
