Appreciate the upload.

Why use Lame VBR V0?


FROM   http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LAME

===
Maximum quality and archiving

Maximum quality is achieved when, regardless of listening conditions, you are unable to detect a difference between the MP3 and the original. As demonstrated by blind ABX tests, LAME-encoded MP3s typically achieve this level of transparency when encoded with the default settings, at bitrates well below maximum. Encoding with other settings will have no effect on the quality.

For archiving, only lossless formats like WavPack, FLAC, etc. are ideal; they will preserve the audio with no changes, sample-for-sample, regardless of encoder settings. In contrast, lossy formats like MP3 are designed to save space by changing the audio in subtle, often imperceptible ways, even at the encoder's maximum settings.
[edit] Very high quality: HiFi, home, or quiet listening, with best file size

-V0 (~245 kbps), -V1 (~225 kbps), -V2 (~190 kbps) or -V3 (~175 kbps) are recommended.

These VBR settings will normally produce transparent results. Audible differences between these presets may exist, but are rare.

So please

1) for losless use FLAC
2) for lossy use Lame -V3; all above V3 is a waste of bits.

Would be great to have a FLAC encode of this one."
