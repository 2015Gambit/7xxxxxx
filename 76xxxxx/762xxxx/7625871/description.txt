Foul-mouthed Australian comedian Jim Jeffries puts everything out there in this raunchy HBO comedy special that marks his full-length solo debut -- and shows off his skill for skewering sacred cows with brutal honesty. Over the course of a no-holds-barred evening during which no subject is safe, Jeffries dissects double standards when it comes to women, men and sex, and explains why being a slut is easier than being a stud.

Career

He first achieved international popularity after he was attacked onstage while performing at the Manchester Comedy Store.[4] At one time, Jefferies even incorporated the incident (and its video recording) into his act. This can be seen on his 2008 UK home video release, Contraband. He is now well known in the USA after his extremely popular debut stand-up special on HBO.[5]

Jefferies has performed at numerous festivals, including the Edinburgh Fringe, Montreal Comedy Festival (Just for Laughs), South African Comedy Festival Cape Town, Reading and Leeds Festivals and the Glastonbury Festival. He has appeared on BBC television shows, such as Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Have I Got News For You, The Heaven and Earth Show, and 8 out of 10 Cats. Jefferies has also performed spots on The World Stands Up, Comedy Blue and Edinburgh and Beyond for the Comedy Central.

He has also been featured on various programmes, including BBC Radio 5 Live's Saturday morning sports show, Fighting Talk,[6] and is a regular guest on the The Opie and Anthony Show.[7]

Jefferies has now started a podcast Jim and Eddie Talkin' Shit twice a week, with his fellow comedian and friend Eddie Ifft. It is recorded from Ifft's home in L.A.[8]

In June 2012 FX picked up Jefferies new comedy series 'Legit'. It is due to start in January 2013, and is set to have 13 episodes.[9]
