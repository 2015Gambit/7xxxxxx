 Tyke continues to craft his own unique sound and build on his reputation for
 producing dirty analogue Bass music with his latest gruesome release on Grid
 Recordings. After starting the year with the massive "Infected Headphones" and filthy
 follow up "Drug Pusher", Tyke now unleashes the Nightmare EP - 6 tracks of grimy
 dance floor orientated Drum and Bass which stand out from the crowd for all the right
 reasons!

 "Nightmares" kicks off the EP, and after chilling synths and an eerie sample, Tyke
 brings the pain with his trademark bass once again taking no prisoners. Offering no
 let up "Dr DeathÆ, æAliens", and "Jaguar" all hit home Tyke's talent for producing
 tracks that rock the dance floor every single time. "The Number" and Own It's round
 off the Nightmare EP in manic fashion. Featuring chaotic breaks and yet another rude
 bassline, "Own It' bares all the hallmarks of another outrageous Tyke release.

 Support for this EP already from Crissy Criss, DJ Hype, DJ Marky, Hazard, Grooverider
 and many more.
