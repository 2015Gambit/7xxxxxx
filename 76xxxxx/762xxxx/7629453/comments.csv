,MagiciansFR,2012-09-13T02:08Z,"Thank you so much for this. Particularly S.M. Stirling ""Lord of Mountains"". Since Demonoid went down, it's been hard to find lately published books and audio books. You wouldn't happen to know a good source would you? Other torrent sites pretty much suck as they throw all their books and audio books in together and you can't even filter for Sci-fi/fantasy. IRC is VERY limited and slow. Boy I miss Demonoid!"
,micron66,2012-09-13T03:05Z,"@MagiciansFR

IRC is good for ebooks (due to their small size) but audiobooks via IRC can take a long time to download due to the much larger size.

Sadly,at this point no other public torrent site has filled the void left by Demonoid with regard to Ebooks/Audiobooks,the noid had the best book community for sure.

Try these -

,micron66,2012-09-13T22:15Z,"@StellaMahonney

hey,i really like the Sandman Slim series too!!"
,wcott,2012-09-14T17:17Z,"Great stuff, micron!! Also am in the Demonoid mourning group - they had a great book collection.
Can you grab the Atticus series by Greg Rucka??
I've only seen the odd one here and there.
Again...very cool stuff. Thanks."
,wcott,2012-09-14T19:57Z,"One more question - your earlier uploads from 2011,( wonderful stuff BTW) they're great and all...
but is there a way to sort the titles in some fashion? By author or series? There's so much wicked stuff...but it's really overwhelming."
,ineffed,2012-09-14T22:05Z,Thanks again!
,micron66,2012-09-14T23:15Z,"@wcott

You mean Fantasy,SciFi,Thriller,Mystery,Horror- New Releases 1-14 right ?

I'm not really sure what you mean by 'sort the titles',couls you explain more ?

All my ebook uploads are sorted this way - 

Author name - Series name - Series no. - book title"
,wcott,2012-09-15T00:49Z,"Sorry...I was clicking on ""Files"", and your files would come up..but it seems it wasn't sorted. There'd be a book by an author listed - and then 20 down, there'd be another book by the same author. I'll figure it out. Excuse the newbie."
,micron66,2012-09-15T02:45Z,"@wcott 

ah,i understand what your saying,those earlier torrents had been uploaded without using the ""preserve file order"" featire in my torrent client,that's probably why they show up randomly when you clicked on 'files'.

But you can still see the correct file order in the torrent description and furthermore the correct file order will be preserved when you download it so it shoudn't be a problem."
