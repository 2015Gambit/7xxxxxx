,anti-shit,2012-09-12T16:27Z,"As said on the other torrent, I'm encoding 480p rips and will have them up soon. Since there is a noticeable difference between the HD and SD resolution I wanted to put up 1080p and 720p (soon). Lots of people asked for it. Especially from Plan 9 and House on Haunted Hill which uses HD res in the riffed movie itself.

My bad if this size isn't for you. Like I said I'll have smaller ones up in a day or so."
