Achhoot Kanya|1936|Ashok Kumar~Devika Rani|Xvid|MP3|Phantom

Achhoot Kanya (Untouchable Maiden) is a 1936 Hindi film. Among the early super-hits in the Bombay film industry, the film deals with the social position of Dalit girls and is considered a reformist period-piece.

The film was one of several successful Bombay Talkies collaborations between Franz Osten, Niranjan Pal, Himanshu Rai, and their leading lady, Devika Rani. Music is by Saraswati Devi and lyrics by J.S. Kashyap.

The movie stars Ashok Kumar (cast after the original hero had eloped with the producer's wife and leading lady) and Devika Rani (the producer's wife who decided to come back) in the lead roles.

This movie stands out as one of the heralding social dramas of pre-independence Indian film. It was the story of a Brahmin boy falling in love with a girl from the so-called untouchables in Indian society. It was a big hit and started the trend of socially committed films.

This movie has the most famous song of the black & white era, "Main Ban Ki Chidiya, Ban Hi Ban Mein Dolu Re." A duet sung by Ashok Kumar & Devika Rani live on the shoot with the musicians sitting behind the camera & playing live music. An era when there was no technology of recording studios etc.
