Taking the screen for a second season, VH1's "Basketball Wives LA" rebounds with new friendships and fresh additions to the team. Familiar faces returning are Jackie Christie, Gloria and Laura Govan, Malaysia Pargo and Draya Michele. Other friends also join in to make season two even spicier than the first.

 A big thank you to all original cappers and posters
