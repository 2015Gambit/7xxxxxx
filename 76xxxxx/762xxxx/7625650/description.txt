#Description
Advanced Task Manager (ATMGR or ATM) is basicly a task killer. It can list all the running tasks, and you can select some of them to kill. It is also a task manager tool to manage all the apps or running apps, you can long click on the task that you want to kill, and you will get a poped up menu with more options.

You may found that some apps are restarted again and again after killing, for some tasks are restarted by system events automatically. And we suggest that you enable Auto Kill in settings. Then it will kill tasks on every screen off. It will help to save battery and extend the battery life by terminating some apps that drawns too much battery.

There are many task killer apps in the google market. What is the difference between our app with other task killers? Basically our app killer list more apps then others, because the way we use to get system running task list is same as the android system panel. Another important difference is that we have an uninstaller feature in our task killer, and you can uninstall useless apps. Most of the task killers have one click widget, but our widget can show available memory. It's not default enabled, users should enable it in settings. Overall our app killer is the best one of so many task or app kill tools in the market.
