[T],MrDowntown,2012-09-13T17:55Z,"As stated in the description Issue 2 is missing - I have searched everywhere - hopefully it will appear someday - Hell, someone finally scanned the last 2 issues of Supurbia like 6 months late... guess theres hope"
,Llewoj,2012-09-14T10:47Z,"Well we can all hope for issue 2, or maybe a TPB scan once the whole series is complete...  Who knows...  Thanks again for the upload Downtown.  Cheers."
