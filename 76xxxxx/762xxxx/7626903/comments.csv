I don't know if there's any patches for this, or if their included, but it's not my system. I don't normally have this happen. But the game before this crashed many times, but it did that for everyone. 
That was Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier. The pc version of that is a real mess to play. This one is older but has great graphics. I have everything turned to max settings and it looks good.

I have:
Amd-960t cpu-w/6cores running-3.8ghz.
8 gbs ram
Nvidia 560
cooled with Antec 620 liquid-current game temp is around 50c-idle is 32c-
good game-worth the dl time-(2 days)"

It would really be nice if you could work on Max Payne. I know it has issues, but your a smart person! Hell, they need your team over at Valve to help get the long overdue, final chapter of Half Life 2 finished and launched. Now, that one may really give you a challenge! 
Thanks-I'm only an hour into this, and it has crashed to the desktop one time. I have Win 7 running. We'll see how it goes."
,Robspace1,2012-09-24T07:18Z,"OK-sorry for all the posts but you need to know that it keeps crashing to the desktop. I'm about halfway through and I have Win 7. And I am running in administration mode. This is a known issue with the pc version and I can finish it, but just know about this issue."
