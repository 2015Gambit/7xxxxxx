If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: Android
Overview: Get the number one selling refrigerant charging and diagnostic HVAC app - HVAC Buddy.

If you are servicing equipment the best way to begin diagnosis and determine the proper refrigerant charge is to use HVAC Buddy, a set of gauges, and a thermometer.

ΓÇó Superheat for fixed capillary or Subcool forTXV/EXV systems
ΓÇó Calculates targeted vs. actual Subcooling
ΓÇó 71 refrigerants including R-22 (Freon), R-410A (Puron), R-404A, R-134A
ΓÇó Airflow / Delta-T / TEET Calculation
ΓÇó Diagnosis tab for leaks, overcharge, contaminants, etc.
ΓÇó Email System Status Report
ΓÇó Imperial (IP) or Metric (SI)
ΓÇó Use Target Superheat and Subcool tables or enter manually
ΓÇó Fast! Update values realtime with Temp and Press sliders
ΓÇó User friendly with several pages of step by step instructions

if the early outdoor temperature is 75F and you charge the system to a ΓÇ£beer can coldΓÇ¥ suction line your system is likely improperly charged. Later in the afternoon high temperatures will increase head pressure and the resulting overcharge means a lower than desired superheat and wasted energy. Not good!

Features:

Use HVAC Buddy to enter refrigerant, temperatures, and pressures. The math is done for you to display Superheat or SubcoolingTarget, Actual, and Difference. Use temperature and pressure sliders to see what happens in realtime when these values change. HVAC Buddy contains generic charts for target Superheat and Subcool as well as pressure-temperature tables for 71 Refrigerants. Temperature data for your pressure is displayed on the refrigerant row and changes can easily be viewed by moving the pressure slider. Add or recover refrigerant to get the Actual value to within the displayed target Superheat or Subcool range.

This app does NOT have a traditional PT Chart display. However, you can view temperatures in the upper left hand corner given any vapor line pressure (Superheat tab) or Liquid leaving pressure (Subcooling tab).

Recent Changes:
Version 1.3.2 - Added Localization for French.
