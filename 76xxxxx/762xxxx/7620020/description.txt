Paper Mario, known as Mario Story (πâ₧πâ¬πé¬πé╣πâêπâ╝πâ¬πâ╝ Mario Sut┼ìr─½) in Japan, is a video game for the Nintendo 64 released in 2000. It was originally in development for the Nintendo 64DD[2]. Originally a sequel to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, the game became the first in its own series, and it was succeeded in 2004 by Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, which was then succeeded in 2007 by Super Paper Mario which will in turn be succeeded by Paper Mario: Sticker Star. In July 2007, the game, requiring 270 blocks of memory, was released for the Virtual Console in all regions for 1,000 Wii Points.

In this game, King Bowser steals the Star Rod from Star Haven and imprisons the seven Star Spirits. He plans to use it to get all his selfish wishes, while everyone else's wishes go ungranted, and after using the Star Rod to destroy Mario and kidnap Princess Peach, he uses his castle to uproot Peach's Castle into the stratosphere. Now, Peach's Castle is teetering on top of Bowser's. It may look as if the Mushroom Kingdom is doomed with Peach and the Star Rod in Bowser's sinister clutches, so Mario, with the help of his partners and the Star Spirits, must embark on a mission to set free the Star Spirits, defeat King Bowser, rescue Princess Peach, and take back the Star Rod.

It's just the ROM in a .zip, please 'if you don't own this game, delete it'. 
You can't really support the makers by buying this, anymore, but It's a great game, and I'd like more people to be able to experience it. 

Please seed!
Thanks, new man -Mehwter.
