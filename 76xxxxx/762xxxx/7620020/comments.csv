,staticstato,2012-09-11T11:58Z,"Ha ha for real mate 20mb? For one this isnt a PC game and you probably havent included an emulator to play it, and two you can easily get this and every other rom that came out for the n64 at doperoms. I appreciate your effort for uploading this torrent but have in turn, upset me for being so rude about it. take it easy."
,black.hat,2012-09-12T15:13Z,"unfortunately most people don't seed until they get to a 1.000 ratio or even a 0.500 ratio.  even the well-seeded torrents are supported mainly by a top group of ""super seeders"" that may be 5-10% of all downloaders.  sad but true

but it is only a 22 MB file.  i don't think you needed to kill / unseed your torrent because the first bloke to download it from you didn't do his fair share"
