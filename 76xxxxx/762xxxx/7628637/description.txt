Begun in the late 1970s and published sporadically through to the mid-1980s, Commies From Mars is a uniquely funny comic. It combines a fondness for alien invader science-fiction with good old-fashioned anti-Communist paranoia and a hippieΓÇÖs love of sex, jokes, and sly humor.

Ted Boxell was the organizing force behind this anthology series, and he invited a collection of underground comic artists to contribute short stories to each issue. Although all based around the theme of Communist invaders from Mars, each has its own take on the subject. Expect to see everything from depictions of President Reagan as a Martian lizard creature, to lowbrow alien sex strips, to truly devilish tales of Martians using our own stupidity to help them destroy our world.

Issues 1-6. Copmplete series I believe.
