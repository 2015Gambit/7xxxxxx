In this off-beat, pro-Indian western, a West Point graduate with a lot of knowledge about the Seminole Indians is stationed in the Florida Everglades to oversee the outpost. As soon as he arrives he goes to see his old flame, who has fallen in love with his childhood friend, now the leader of the local tribe. Seeing a prime opportunity, the lieutenant decides to use the girl to enact a new peace treaty. Unfortunately, his superior officer, a real Indian hater mucks things up when a member of his scouting party murders a high-ranking tribesman. As more terrible events occur, tensions between the Seminoles and the whites escalate until the lieutenant is forced to turn against his own commander in a desperate bid for peace.
