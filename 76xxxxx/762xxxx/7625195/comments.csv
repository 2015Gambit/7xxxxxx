,m88k,2012-09-12T20:15Z,Is the movie good?
,ZlaZena,2012-09-12T20:40Z,IMDB says 8.3 - so either it is a really good movie - or a really strange movie..
,sudopin,2012-09-12T23:11Z,only 10 reviewers atm. could mean anything
,Whitegard,2012-09-12T23:25Z,"@ZlaZena

8.3 with 16 votes. That's not enough votes to give an accurate score.
Most titles on IMDB decrease in score as more vote come in (atleast i've never seen a movie get higher score as votes go up)
So don't get your hopes up."

,pilot234,2012-09-13T07:50Z,I saw the movie just looking at the screenshots and the display pic and still wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
,JGardinerEntropy,2012-09-13T08:22Z,Incredibly horrible movie. Not worth the download. Movie - 2
,OvOvO,2012-09-13T10:07Z,"its five short stories and its good

6/10"
,skulldragon,2012-09-13T10:39Z,"I don't get it, how do IMDB critics rate movies?
There are only few movie mistakes indeed, but it's so damn cheap I can make this film myself using only sockpuppets. The stories are boring and this is more like soft.. pussycore horror for 3 yr olds and younger. I stopped watching this movie after 30 min, opened YouTube and watched all Gangnam Style song versions - now that was entertainment! After that I watched on, with skip-forwarding... If I had gone to cinema to see this, I would have asked my money back and sued the cinema for visual damage. Somebody nuke Hollywood!"
,dubblue4,2012-09-13T16:09Z,thanks
,FriendlySpidey,2012-09-13T19:18Z,"It's not that hard to figure out. When there's a low number of votes and a ridiculously high score, it's usually because all the votes are from people who were cast/crew in the movie. They give it really high scores to get people to watch it. "
,mindless92,2012-09-13T20:15Z,you cant look at the imdb ratings when only 16 have rated the movie..
,bionikspoon,2012-09-14T01:07Z,"everyone is saying this is a terrible movie, but imdb rates it at 8.3!!!  What's the deal?"
,Zanteater,2012-09-14T01:46Z,I can't believe this is a real movie...
,Kiriyama87,2012-09-14T02:41Z,"imdb 8.3/10, 16 voters

not even the cast of the movie gave it a full 10, because I'm assuming those are the only voters so far.

I'd give it a 1.5"
,dfl3506,2012-09-14T02:48Z,"A10, V10. Movie is strictly amateur hour. Watched the first story and it was so bad I couldn't bother after that. Waste of time."
,serb_1982,2012-09-14T11:31Z,"Another ""clown movie""...

Why are Americans afraid of clowns?"
,treetops422,2012-09-14T12:19Z,"Wow that picture reminds me of the movie IT, by stephen king send a chill up my spine, that movie freaked me out when I was a kid."

and all the rest of you fucking morons that tells ppl to avoid this; you guys are fucking hollywood-brainwashed turds and should get some fucking help



to re rest of ya'll, this movie is far from gr8, but if you are a fan of horrormovies, you will probably enjoy this more than those cocksucking retards mentioned above, so just don't listen to them"
,arnaiz08,2012-09-23T01:27Z,horribly thanks
,omgwtfnoob,2012-09-24T12:06Z,"cover and title does not tell the story... if you're expecting a scary movie like i was, you're mistaken. not at all scary, and overall a pretty bad movie. hard to get into the plot when it changes 4 times.

A: 10
V: 10
M: 1 - not worth the watch, even just to see how bad it is"
