I am also in love with these french, belgian and danish comics, that are tickles your imagination.

I love the style of Jean-David Morvan. Do you also have the Zorn and Dirna series by him? Also looking for the latest Percevan. Can you find those?

Keep up the good work! You are deeply appreciated!"

As for Percevan, it depend on what you mean ""latest"", there are 4 books out in english, 3 issue sin each book, so 1-12 out total. 13-14 is not out in english."

I dont know if they will be released in english at all?

Just getting to know these gems, that otherwise might be forgotten is great. This is truly an great work for the spread of culture and art!"

Fantasy Flight Games was just doing those, no other comisc, and no clue how well they sold (so buy them, CHEAP for 150+ pages hardcore book), but they were 3 pr book, and knowing Luguy, its anyones guess when 15 is out in french, and nothing will happen before then :)"
