Valerian and Laureline 01 - The City of Shifting Waters - Extended Edition!
Here is a little surprise that I bet that noone saw coming, Valerian and Laureline 01 - The City of Shifting Waters - Extended Edition!

Most people don't know this, but almost all printings of this book are actually missing 5 pages, and have 2 changed pages to make up for the cut.
I put a little info in a txt file in the book about why, so read the text popup for once :)
