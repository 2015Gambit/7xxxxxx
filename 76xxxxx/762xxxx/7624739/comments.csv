,wn143,2012-09-12T06:09Z,"I downloaded and viewed the SAMPLE.avi file and it clearly is not a native 720p HD  copy.  It is however as advertised, an upscaled DVDR.  Not bad quality,  (V-5, A-6), quite watchable, but I think I'll wait for the real HighRes rip for this movie."
,moshster,2012-09-12T10:02Z,Can anyone comment on the audio specs plz?
,DeanMachine16,2012-09-12T11:05Z,"I think it looks really great considering.
A whole lot better than I thought it would.
Maybe 8-9/10 all around (cause I know the legit 720p versions will be better when they come out).
Better than any DVD rip and reminds me of those lower sized hi-def torrents we see, only at 3gigs, it's not a lower size file.

Not sure if these will work but here's some screens I snapped:

,toxicstone,2012-09-13T15:41Z,"DeanMachine16 if you think thats good quallity you are really dumb, i have downloaded 720p 4.36gb and that was good quality, this just sucks, why not bann people for uploading this shit!"
,granyx,2012-09-13T15:50Z,"Downloaded and played on PS3, great video quality but sound is WAY out of sinc."
,31Romulus,2012-09-13T19:37Z,"@ toxicstone:
Considering that this movie hasn't been released on BluRay Discs, this quality is just great! So, if you don't like it, just wait for the BluRay disc to show up, and buy the damn thing!"
,shingoy,2012-09-15T03:05Z,"sound is crappy, it's clicking, the picture is quite good for an upscaled version tho"
,slopet6,2012-09-17T22:58Z,"Not even close to 720. Hell its not even as good as a 600 meg divx. Ive seen TS prints better than this trash. 

Please remove this from the Hi Res tag and atleast include a screenshot if not a sample. Will never seed this rubbish. "
