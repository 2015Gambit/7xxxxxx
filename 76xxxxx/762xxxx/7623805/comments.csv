[V],twentyforty,2012-09-11T19:19Z,"@krisnisc: Moonrise Kingdom is not out yet. Some weird non-English rip is floating around - and many many fakes.

Please, listen: Do not use street or local slang on international sites. Please. You just called me like ""Hey, pair of tits, do me a favor..."".

We ALL have our ""handles"" (screen-names) for addressing."

Thanks."
,critic89,2012-09-12T10:26Z,"hi sir, your white collar encodes were excellent..i expected it to be hdtv..but u doing it as web-dl..was a bonus..thank you for that,although i wondered why you name white collar season 2 as hdtv..it consisted of all web-dl..except 1..:/
the show is nice..and moreover it has different charm as watching it in web-dl,rather than hdtv.:)
sir could you please do teen wolf season 1

[V],twentyforty,2012-09-12T13:20Z,"BTW, Teen Wolf is MTV and stupid - I don't touch MTV series, Bravo and such shit."
