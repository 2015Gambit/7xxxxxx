Coloritsts - Rachelle Menashe, Chris Chalenor

Issue Two: No credits in the scanned version.

'Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Special' 
1st and 2nd editions - there are slight variations between the two versions, including the cover. I'm sure there is a reason why two different versions of the same book exist, but I don't know what it is. First edition was released in Jan, second edition released in Aug, 1995.
Dark Horse Comics
Pretty much the same credits as the five issue mini...
