Sources were unmodified win7ultsp1 oem and win7sp1ent oem dvds

From there I added all the post-sp1 kb files that were missing. (Except 971033)
I excluded 971033 because it is an anti-piracy hotfix and even though it supposedly 
does not affect windows loader and possibly kms, I felt it was a bad idea to 
include it.

Then I added a $oem$ directory to add:

Directx June 2010 runtimes
.Net 4.5 full (includes 4.0)
kb2533552 (doesn't allow offline integration)

That's all I did.  I used microsoft dism for the package additions and gimagex to 
compress the install.wim to maximum.  I have not tweaked any settings or added any 
unnecessary programs other than dotnet 4.5.

To crack simply open the Activation Cracks subdirectory on the dvd and use the 
appropriate one.  KMS is for enterprise, loader is for everything else.
