This file was ripped from YouTube and credit should go to uploader. Contains the watermark LP2008 in the upper left hand corner. Video appears letterbox framed, still playing with encoding resolutions but the file is watchable (bare with me). It is the full race commercial free.

Please seed at full speed during and after download so that others can also enjoy and be sure to check out other CARG releases.
