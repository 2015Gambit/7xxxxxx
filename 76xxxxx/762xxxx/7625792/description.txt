And now I transform from the negative guy to the positive guy.
I don't actually think that MP4 sucks - I just hate the way it was jammed
Down everyone's collective throat. There became something to protect.

But, enough of the hatin' and on to the lovin' ...

I love AVI and recently a comment merely stated "thank you AVI guy".
It had the cadence of "Thank You Mask Man" (This first offering).
And therefore I now transmogrificate into AVIGUY

MP4SUX now tags every file with AVIGUY.
MP4SUX will still do all the posting.

Please hold your cheers down to a dull roar.
All previous posts will be seeded for as long as is practicable.
