,MagiciansFR,2012-09-13T07:46Z,The aurthor is Kelly Armstrong. I've been looking all over for the third book in the series - The Rising. Does anyone have it? Please post if you do.
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-13T07:46Z,"Thanks for this. Since Demonoid went down, it's been hard to find lately published books and audio books. You wouldn't happen to know a good source would you? Other torrent sites pretty much suck as they throw all their books and audio books in together and you can't even filter for Sci-fi/fantasy. IRC is VERY limited and slow. Boy I miss Demonoid!"

""MagicianFR"" Your are wrong!!"
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-14T00:17Z,"The Torrent Heading had Armstron, not Armstrong, just pointing out a minor error. Does anyone have the third book in the Darkness Rising Series - The Rising.? If so, please post upload."
