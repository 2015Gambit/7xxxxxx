This version work fine with lucky patcher.The 1.0.1 works too and it needed the lucky patcher too."
,HrBingR0,2012-09-12T19:27Z,"Hey bobiras, I can't get either 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 to work.. 1.0.0 tries to connect to the server, fails (because I have no internet) then closes. 1.0.1 tells me it needs to connect and then immediately fails. I gopy the folder in ""SD Data by Bobiras2009"" into /sdcard/android/data but it still won't work. Tried using lucky patcher on 1.0.1 and it still doesn't work, despite being connected to the net when patching, and I have the latest version.. Can you please give me step by step instructions? Also, I use a Huawei S7 Slim with CM9 (ICS 4.0.4) and all your other uploads work great. Also, thanks for uploading Kaspersky Mobile Security - Lucky Patcher worked well for me with that one."

This only work in rooted devices till now.If you have root it will work fine in all devices."
,HrBingR0,2012-09-13T18:07Z,"Hey Bobiras, me again. I'm having problems with 1.0.2 now. I have root, I used TB to restore the data, and use lucky patcher (without internet) to remove the license verification (4/7 succeeded), I copy the data to /sdcard/android/obb and I still get the license verification failed. Do I need internet to use lucky patcher? If not, can you please give me a step-by-step on how to use lucky patcher for this game? I click it, choose patches, choose license verification, and choose auto, and check auto and extreme. Is this correct? I really want to play this awesome game.

Seeding, and will seed for the next 2 weeks, maybe longer."
,HrBingR0,2012-09-13T20:07Z,"Okay, I got past the license verification error, but if I put the data in /sdcard/android/obb, the game crashes. If I don't put the data there, it tells me it needs to download additional data, and immediately fails. This is really frustrating, because the game immediately crashes when I put the SD data where it should be. Can anyone help me?"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-15T06:52Z,"@HrBingR0
Just see your comments.You must put the folder inside the SD Data By bobiras2009 to sdcard/android/obb and not the folder sd data by bobiras2009.

The steps are:

Put TB files in titaniumbackup folder and restore apk+data
Remove license verification with Lucky Patcher
Copy com.atv.blackops folder to'sdcard/Android/obb/' 
Launch the Game

With this way it must work 100%"
,Akhil0309,2012-09-16T12:12Z,"Hey bobiras2009..i have done everything right..

,br1ng1t0nh0,2012-09-20T22:21Z,"getting ""corruption error"" this thing took so long to download.=("
,SceneModz,2012-09-22T04:34Z,"To all the guys getting the dreaded download error it happens even on the market game.

You just need to reinstall the APK over and over until it works.Thats the only thing I had to and it works just reinstall the apk part and eventually it will work."
