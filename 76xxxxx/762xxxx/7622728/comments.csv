[V],mirrormaster82,2012-09-11T18:14Z,"Thanks for this,I'm currently up to 12 track and around 3rd minute the volume suddenly goes way up!?I'm hugely disappointed by this album btw..."
,selfloadingpistol,2012-09-12T01:35Z,"Very odd. The volume on tracks 9-11 and the first two minutes of track 12 (""Battle Born"") is down 6 dB compared to the rest of the album. Look at the tracks in any program that shows the waveforms. It'd be nice if somebody posted a unflawed rip."
,g8aso,2012-09-12T09:44Z,"It's only in joint stereo, I'll have to wait for a proper stereo version with 2 separate channels."
,xebrake,2012-09-12T10:51Z,Damn. Really wanna hear this but not if the sound is messed up. Gonna wait on this. Might even buy it to support them. I still remember listening to Day & Age for the first time back in Fall 2008. Love the Killers.

Thank you! That looks much better! The sound level is consistent throughout the album."
,g8aso,2012-09-13T17:39Z,"I'll have it in FLAC in a day or so, I'll put a link up here, you can convert it into MP3 Dual Channel, or anything else you fancy."
,g8aso,2012-09-14T16:44Z,"As promised, here are links to this in lossless FLAC, you gan then convert it into any format you like, if it's MP3, try and preserve the stereo by using Dual Channel as Joint Stereo and Stereo are not stereo at all."
