Various Artists - Psych Bites Vol.1 (1967-74/2009) [FLAC]

Genre: Aussie, Dynamic Acid Freak Rock

Australians have a well-deserved reputation for liking their rock & roll hard, heavy, and without a lot of gingerbread, and it should come as no surprise that a lot of their psychedelic stuff doesn't dwell much on peace, love, and flowers.
