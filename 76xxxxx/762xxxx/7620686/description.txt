Audio and texts in Spanish and English.

The movie at the caves has been deleted; the rest of them and every animation have been kept.

Lan/vpn (Hamachi, for example) cooperative play works perfectly. It also works online using the XLIVE platform if you know how to do it (Google it!).

Some antivirus may say some files are infected (trainers and Teknogods' files), but they are not.

It is very recommended to use the file "options.cmd" to see all the options of this release before saying it does not work.
