When a favor to a friend leaves Cal Jardine caught up in the Spanish Civil War, he finds himself with an interesting assortment of fighters, though they make an effective team.

Starting as a bunch of athletes, his new compatriots are primed for the fight, however with a communist fanatic in the ranks trouble is brewing and a murderous betrayal lies ahead. He meets the revolutionary, Juan Laporta, and if his companions do not make a perfect combination as fighters they form an effective one, both in Barcelona and then as they advance into the interior. But trouble is brewing in the person of communist diehard Manfred Drecker which threatens the fight and Cal himself.

From the street battles of Barcelona to the fighting in the countryside, Cal finds action as well as friendship, but following a murderous betrayal he must have suitable revenge.
