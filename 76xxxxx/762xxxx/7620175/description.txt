GPS Speedometer & Flashlight app is a free software for Android devices with built-in GPS receiver. It acts as a normal speedometer, showing the speed of the vehicle you are in.

There is also a flashlight available. You turn it on and off by simply clicking the green button, located in the top right corner of the app.

NOTE: This Android application is still in BETA phase, so please, be patient. I will update it as soon as possible.
