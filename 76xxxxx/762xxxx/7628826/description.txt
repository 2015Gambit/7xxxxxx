Dvd Vol.1 to Vol.5 of the anime series SF Saiyuki Starzinger including episode 1-60. Ripped in the highest quality. Therefor you must have Double Layered Dvd discs when burning these onto Dvd. If you want to look at the files on the computer, Vlc Media player is the best to use.

I'm missing the last and final Volume and that is Vol.6, so if anybody out there is having or can obtain it, please feel free to write in the comment field. Would like response to this upload also, so write if you me to continue and releasing the last Dvd when I get it.

There's an ongoing project of subbing this anime to English, as of now you can find the first two episodes here, check that site out and please help if you can:
