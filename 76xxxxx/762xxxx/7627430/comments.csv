So, this is actually a pretty bad ass movie, bunch of people find themselves in a room where they gotta inflict pain on each other, sure why not?

Seems to appeal to anyone who liked movies like Saw, or Exam, along those lines, but why did I give it a crappy overall as a movie?

The actors.

I swear none of them seemed very good at acting! The film, the cameras, the lighting, even the plot was all done very well, just picked a bunch of actors who wouldnt even make it on a made for tv movie.

I managed through it though, but be warned, SUB PAR ACTING THROUGHOUT."
