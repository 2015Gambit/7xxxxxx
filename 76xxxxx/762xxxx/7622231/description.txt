A Collection of Questions and Problems in Physics by L. A. Sena.

The aim of the present collection of questions and problems is to develop practical skills during study of one of the fundamental sciences, physics. The Collection is intended for the self-instruction of students of technical colleges. The best way to use it is to solve the problems while preparing for term exams. The Collection contains more than 400 questions and problems covering all the sections of the physics course.

All questions and problems have detailed answers and solutions. For this reason the two main sections of the book, Questions and Problems and Answers and Solutions, have identical headings and numbering: each chapter in the first section has a corresponding chapter in the second, and the numbering of answers corresponds to the numbering of problems.
  
  A special feature of the Collection is the drawings and    diagrams for most of the questions and answers. The diagrams use a variety of scales: linear, semilog, log-log, and quadratic.
    Arrangement of the material in this Collection corresponds to the structure most commonly used in college physics textbooks. One exception is the questions and problems involving the special theory of relativity. These are placed in different chapters, starting from the one dealing with mechanics.

The book was translated from the Russian by Eugene Yankovsky and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1988.
