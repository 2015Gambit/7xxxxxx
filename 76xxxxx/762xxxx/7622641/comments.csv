,MsMuffet,2012-09-12T12:08Z,"This week will be quite a milestone with the exit of Ronn Moss on the 14th ... he's going to be missed by many of his fans and it signals a close to the old days of the ""Core Four""!
MsFenmore, thank you for bringing us B&B history! 
Cheers from Down Under ;-)"
,disneydreams,2012-09-12T17:37Z,thanks for doing these every day Ms Fenmore
,atzensuisse,2012-09-12T20:43Z,I'll second that MsMuffet-Ron Moss will be missed on this mega show!!! I wonder who will replace him??? We will have to see eh!!!
,mwalsher,2012-09-29T21:05Z,"I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t watch soap-operas but my mother does, so Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;ve become second-hand familiar with it (against my will :-P) so I know what a big deal it is for Ridge to leave.

Who is Taylor going to stalk now? Maybe one of her daughters will get married so that she can go after another son-in-law."
,mwalsher,2012-09-30T00:22Z,I meant Brooke not Taylor.
,mwalsher,2012-09-30T00:25Z,"Oh, and apparently Stephanie is leaving too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Bold_and_the_Beautiful_cast_members

That leaves Eric wide open (again) for Brooke. *sigh*"
