""WILL NOT get ANY better THEN THIS! Enjoy"" 
Does this means we should not expect Original audio scene?"
,j3ff78,2012-09-12T19:28Z,No that means he his best to make the audio as clean as it can get and such.
,haggie,2012-09-13T04:32Z,r5.cam? Isn't it one or the other?
,a-mac,2012-09-13T05:25Z,"-haggie

r5 refers to the video and cam the audio. r5 are usually in movies dubbed russian which are released early over there in order to combat russian piracy. So they are often synced to an english audio source by p2p and scene groups, usually line audio from telesyncs. However if none is available, such as this case, cam audio is used "
,Falkkon,2012-09-13T19:42Z,"When, oh when, are people going to realize that Steve Carell is NOT FUNNY?"
,vitlook,2012-09-13T20:30Z,"@Falkkon About the same time ppl will realize that lettuce doesn't taste good.

one man's meat is another man's poison."
,nurocuz,2012-09-13T20:56Z,seems legit
,Dynasaty,2012-09-13T21:13Z,Sample looks great.  Thank You.

V/8"
,Quantico7,2012-09-14T14:15Z,"yeah its a fuckin good movie hey, well worth the download, sort of a quirky comedy with some sombre moments and a bit of romance, i really liked it

V: 8.5 (as good as any R5 i have seen, basically dvd rip)
A: 6 (bit compressed in some parts, as expected with its source, but doesn't wreck the movie at all)"
,hijikata76,2012-09-14T18:25Z,"Yeah... right. I think I'll pass. Thanks anyway.

The thing with Steve Carrel is that people expect him to be something he's NOT. A proper actor, that is.
He's a douche. Sometimes it can be fun watching a douche be a douche. Most of the times it's just pointless.
When Ricky Gervais casted 'The Douche' for US 'The Office', I thought: brilliant. What a f*** genius. But then, hollywood ass-grabbers decided to cast him on non-douche roles... As if that would make him less-a-douche. It didn't. Instead, we now have the world's biggest douche playing several roles intended to proper actors.
That's a whole lot of wasted film. What a shame..."
,davilou143,2012-09-14T22:34Z,"I Can never understand why people are on a torrent page to go on & on about how they dislike the actor in the movie... Why are u even on the page! Keep it moving if you don't like, then don't download! Some of us just want to know the quality of the torrent in question. Jeeze... have nothing better to with your time? Thank you to the uploader who went through the trouble to offer this torrent for free!"
,i_am_NEO,2012-09-14T23:24Z,"hijikata76...

,Ext_in_use,2012-09-16T10:44Z,"Thanks for the upload'' I loved this movie but then i love this genre, that is end of the world movies, i think that someone could have played the role alot better than steve carell, but it is what it is and i will definitly watch this movie again, 
Video=10
Audio=9
Audio is completly in sync it just doesnt sound ""perfect"""
,Fritz.,2012-09-17T06:45Z,"was good quality. the people downrating must expect 1080p quality from a 1.3gb r5 ... lol. 

the movies was decent enough. steve carell actually does a pretty good job playing his role and the girl is adorable. "
,siiiix,2012-09-18T04:58Z,"for a cam, its actually impressive

,siiiix,2012-09-18T10:05Z,"i watched the movie now, its actually really good

,karljohnson070991,2012-09-18T18:58Z,"A/ 7-8 didnt effect the overall quality of the torrent.
V/9 Amazing for a cam R5
M/7 Steve could of been funnier. There was a few parts where it was pretty funny. all in all it was a pretty descent movie to sit down and watch to kill some time"
,MyKrossini,2012-09-19T01:03Z,"Just to set things straight... R5 is not a CAM rip it is a Region 5 DVD rip, the audio is CAM audio. So this is a R5 DVD with CAM audio. Whoever you people are who just invented the new term R5 Cam in your heads... Do some reading, educate yourselves. And also, this is MATiNE's release uploaded by scene4all as noted in the info pane. Thanks for the upload. A/V 7/9"
