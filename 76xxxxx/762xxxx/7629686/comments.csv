,sasebastian01,2012-09-13T04:55Z,can I install this on my iPad 3?
,LucaDC,2012-09-13T05:12Z,Thank you so much! will definitely seed!
,Waydezilla,2012-09-13T08:38Z,"Thanks for sharing, but does this work on an iPhone 4 without the S?"
,530anon,2012-09-13T10:31Z,"Worked for me!

I was jailbroken, upgrade did not work for me. But restoring did."
,srslywhitebread,2012-09-13T11:19Z,"@sasebastian01 No, but you can find every other version of iOS 6 at http://jailbreakios6s.com/download-ios-6-gm-ipsw-direct-links/ - you can download the one you need from there.

@Waydezilla Unfortunately, no. Each version of iOS is different for different devices. If you follow the link above, you can find the version for iPhone 4 (be sure to choose the right one between CDMA & GSM) and every other supported device."
,lukbut,2012-09-13T13:24Z,Can someone confirm that this works and that it hasn't been tampered with?

If it was tampered with then the phone wouldn't be able to load it. It has to be clean :)"
,530anon,2012-09-13T20:23Z,I CAN CONFIRM IT IS REAL AND CLEAN I AM RUNNING IT ON MY PHONE. WORKS FINE.
,ezequiell,2012-09-14T05:07Z,"Can anyone confirm if this can be installed in any iPhone 4S or you need to have a developer account or an iPhone with the UDID registered?
I don't want to attempt an installation if my phone is not going to work as I'm not a developer."
,djantz,2012-09-14T06:40Z,"it does indeed work, and i'm not a developer"
,djantz,2012-09-14T06:42Z,@srslywhitebread I'm having trouble restoring back to my backup. It keep freezing at a certain point and time remaining begins to increase. Have you any input on what I may be doing wrong? I can confirm that iOS 6 is working though.
,srslywhitebread,2012-09-14T11:37Z,"@ezequiell AFAIK, Apple no longer requires a UDID for these. It may be all betas, or simply the Gold Master, not sure on that. Either way, this one is 100% fine and requires nothing on your part but the installation.

@djantz Is your backup on iCloud or stored on your Computer? If the latter, I could see Internet connection being a possible problem. I had initially tried to go the iCloud route, but for whatever reason (I highly suspect a less-than-stellar-WIFI connection) my was acting quite slow as well. I never got to the point of time remaining increasing, though. 

If you're going through iTunes though, I would worry that the backup is somehow corrupt."
,srslywhitebread,2012-09-14T11:38Z,"@ezequiell I should say, they no longer require a REGISTERED UDID..."
,vicky20jak,2012-09-14T14:35Z,Does it work with iPad 3 Wifi+4G LTE?
,srslywhitebread,2012-09-15T01:13Z,"@vicky20jak This one is only for iPhone 4S. You can find a download for any other compatible iOS device here: http://jailbreakios6s.com/download-ios-6-gm-ipsw-direct-links/

You'll just have to choose between the GSM & CDMA models, as each requires a different build of iOS."
,skweets,2012-09-15T07:59Z,"Does anyone know if the iOS text spoofing bug been fixed in the iOS 6 GM??

Thanks."
,cclloyd9,2012-09-16T00:12Z,"Are you people really that stupid.  It says in the title 4S, not 4, not iPad 3 (wtf?), NOTHING BUT 4S DUMBASSES"
,nickirich,2012-09-16T13:48Z,Works great!! Thx
,Sindarrr,2012-09-17T06:34Z,I'm on a mac (10.8.1) running iTunes 10.7 (21) and this ipsw file isn't even attempting to open when I try to install it.  Any suggestions?
,77Monk77,2012-09-18T05:16Z,"worked like magic, thanks! I'm on 10.6.8"
