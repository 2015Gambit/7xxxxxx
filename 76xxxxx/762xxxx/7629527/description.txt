Notes: Video has a watermark that appears and then disappears,
the watermark will fade and then pop up in another corner of the
video. Unlike the other video this doesn't have hardcoded foreign
subtitles for all the speaking parts. The audio IS English and
appears to be LiNE audio (If not it is damn good) It will drift in and
out of sync a little but you get used to it after a bit. Don't know
what else to say...
