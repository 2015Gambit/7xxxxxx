V: 8
A: 8"
,luvtpb123,2012-09-13T06:21Z,This will have to do...Cheers BONEYM!
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-13T07:44Z,"Out of Sync and unfortunately not an R6, more of a TS..."
,HRHhira,2012-09-13T12:16Z,"Well, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting. However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. I saw it on latest.haxshells.us they have great quality. I recommend the movie, a great one! "
,johnpaulmathew,2012-09-13T13:36Z,@ Hrhhira: You cant get better quality than here in tpb. so suck it up.
,yerisan710,2012-09-13T19:18Z,Sync audio????????????
,markcle,2012-09-13T19:35Z,"sorry to be a party pooper folks but isn t downloading a hot new film like this just asking for trouble? I would like to see it but don t want to get some letter from some scumbag lawyer demanding a huge payoff so they don t prosecute me ( I heard this happened for other new releases- the hurt locker,etc) Am I being too paranoid? Anybody?"
,dfm2,2012-09-13T23:26Z,"@markcle, yes, you are. Chanses are not bigger here then with any other high budget movie out. Get VPN if u want to be shure not to get caught."
,panosol,2012-09-14T00:14Z,"@markcle dont worry, download this movie and you'll be safe... http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4802896/The_Golem_1920   its old enough and all the cast is past away...i think  hahahahahaha"
,tokerator,2012-09-14T00:28Z,"This is a unique situation where the file actually plays better in WMP than VLC.  The video freezes for me if I skip in VLC but it doesn't in media player.  And yes, the audio goes in and out of sync but it's not too bad. Better looking than cam rip and audio is clean."
,dubstep3,2012-09-14T20:39Z,"For those of you who don't know. In VLC there is an option to speed up or slow down the audio, helping you sync it and enjoy your movie better. In the player there is a button the looks like three I's |||, similar to that. Click it and change the audio sync. Cheers *"
,JChoo,2012-09-15T02:00Z,ide wait for a good copy. These files  from china always freeze when the action gets fast. 
,highlander888,2012-09-15T12:25Z,The AVI file is messed up. The video won't play in VLC or in WMP!
