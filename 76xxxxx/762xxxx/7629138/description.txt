This week we go on a wild ride as I try to fulfil a boyhood dream.  My plan is to catch a fish bigger than the boat I am in and the only thing that may bring me unstuck is that the fish is a lot bigger than I hoped for!!  Jervis Bay really turns it on for this one.  Then itΓÇÖs off to Tassie in an attempt to lower the heart rate.  A spot of fly fishing in a crystal clear stream and the fish play their role beautifully.
