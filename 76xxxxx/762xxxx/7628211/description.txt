Various Artists - The Essential Pebbles Collection Vol. 3 (60's) (2CD) [FLAC]

Genre: Europe, Garage Rock

This double disc set focuses on European freakbeat from the lands of Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland. Disc 1 is a rollercoaster ride of entertainment, from great peaks of garage bliss to barren lows of wannabe-Stones and Kinks. All the selections from Holland and Denmark are here, with the latter half hailing solely from Sweden. Disc 2 kicks off with Swedish freakbeat before taking the train to Germany and finishing the tour in Switzerland.
