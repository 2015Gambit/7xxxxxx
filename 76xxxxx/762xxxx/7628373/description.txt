Four friends lose themselves in a carefree South-East Asian holiday. Only three come back. Dave and Alice return 
home to their young family desperate for answers about Jeremy's mysterious disappearance. When Alice's sister Steph 
returns not long after, a nasty secret is revealed about the night her boyfriend went missing. But it is only the 
first of many. Who amongst them knows what happened on that fateful night when they were dancing under a full moon 
in Cambodia.
