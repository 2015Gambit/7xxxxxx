"He Got Game, She Got Cats"

Ryan comes to grips that he doesn't 
have Janie around to cook or shop for 
him anymore. The group discovers that 
Lauren caves under pressure when 
taking tests and decides to help her 
study for her grad school entrance 
exam. Meanwhile, Steven has broken up 
with his girlfriend and enlists Ryan 
to be his wingman to go out on the 
town.
