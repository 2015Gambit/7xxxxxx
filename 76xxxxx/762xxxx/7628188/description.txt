T&N,is an American heavy metal band formed in 2011 consisting of current and former classic-era Dokken members (George Lynch, Jeff Pilson and Mick Brown),that will release their first album "Slave To The Empire" on Halloween, October 31 2012.But your new friend KrazyKeith has it for you 6 weeks early..Thanks to WackyWendy..
George Lynch says: "We actually did two records. The first one, which will be released on October 31, and then the band will go out on the road; West Coast tour, then play Loud Park festival in Japan as well as visit a few other Asian cities before heading to Europe for a couple weeks.
Then it's back to the States and we will finish up before Christmas, and we were mixing the second disc for 2013".
Tooth and Nail were forced to change their name to T&N because of legal reasons. The band stated; ΓÇ£We cannot keep [the name] as Tooth And Nail as there is a label that has it trademarked. [Fans] can still call us Tooth & NailΓÇª We canΓÇÖt.ΓÇ¥

"Slave To The Empire" includes new original material and reworked Dokken songs.
I like most of the material, resembling Lynch/Pilson past album and of course Dokken, with good vocal performances by Jeff Pilson.
There's also guest singers SASS Jordan, Doug Pinnick (KingsX), Robert Mason (Lynch Mob), Sebastian Bach and Tim ΓÇ£RipperΓÇ¥ Owens.
