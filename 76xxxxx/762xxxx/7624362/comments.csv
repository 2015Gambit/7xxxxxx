,Anroid869,2012-09-12T12:54Z,"Maybe you should consider to put ""Russian language"" in the torrent name!?"
,ileumfour,2012-09-12T14:24Z,"read the description before downloading. ""The Light (2012) PC [RUS]"" ""Made by russian programmer"""
,GoodGravy,2012-09-12T15:08Z,"This seems to be a fairly simple to understand game; I'm English speaking only, buy I realized I don't need to know Russian to play it, ie: a locked door needs a key to open it, so find the key. Character audio is in English though. To enter or exit the game press P; to use the torch, press F, you should figure this game out pretty quickly. Thanks for the upload azaq318, +1 worthy, cheers."
,opaleg,2012-09-13T03:52Z,the title should have RUS in it. Plus just because it's made my a russian programmer doesn't mean it has an english option.
,opaleg,2012-09-13T03:52Z,doesn't have an english option*
