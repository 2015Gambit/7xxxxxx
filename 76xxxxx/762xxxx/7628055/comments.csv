Thanks as always."
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-09-13T01:00Z,"I don't know if it is the dumbest,but I gave up after issue 5.Marvel is really fucking things up year after year with the crossovers...lame and uninteresting,well at least to me.I think that Fear itself was a tad worse,but not much.Main problem is that when they do these huge events,they spread it to 99% of their books.The only things that I'm reading at Marvel are Punisher and Daredevil books,since they are more street level ( underdog ) books,but more important they don't have anything with this shitty event..."
,NinpoLore,2012-09-13T10:34Z,"I'm definitely with you, mirrormaster - AvX started off really strong and I was super psyched to see all the kick-ass battles and twists that would ensue. Unfortunately the writers just dreamed too big and now they can't properly keep hold of things. I will say this, though - I'm glad they brought back Olivier Coipel for this issue, and hopefully the last one too. His pencils are some of the best in the Marvel Universe right now, and I was not happy with Adam/Andy Kubert taking up the reigns the last few issues. Those guys just can't pull it off like Coipel can.

Regardless of my opinions concerning the quality of this crossover, many thanks for the upload!"
