,atzensuisse,2012-09-16T13:11Z,Downloaded the whole set - Snowwhiter- took ages-but well worth the trouble - we're totally hooked on Scandinavian dark - dark & moody alrite!!! Got Sebastian Bergman too!!! Any other Varg's episodes or Bergmenn's out there? Hardcoded of course coz we understand english only!!! Many thanks - great job.
[T],Snowhiter,2012-09-16T18:09Z,Only the 2 Seb Bergmans made atm - another Varg Veum set for upload in a day or two... Glad you appreciate the uploads - regarding the speed - I can only seed for 8 hours per day at approx 400kb/s. It'll get faster the more seeders there are so Seed SEed SEEd SEED ;)
