Fans of Tarzan will love this but it should also appeal to fans of simple
straightforward adventure films and for those of us of a certain age they
are magnificent nostalgia .Two of the films here are certainly amongst the
best ever Tarzan movies and arguably are the best .
This box set wets the appetite for the RKO movies that followed on .
To me it's a series ripe for a (serious) contemporary re-telling but they
would have to go some way to better the best of these vintage classics.
The picture quality isn't that great but is probably as good as it's going
to get .The sound is the real problem. It's rusty to say the least and is
best watched with no other noise distractions.
