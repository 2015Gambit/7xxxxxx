Issues 1-2 of 'I Before E - Stories With Art by Sam Kieth'

Fantagraphics, 1991

Written and Illustrated by Sam Kieth

Over 100 pages of comic book short stories and portfolio pages, many of them previously unpublished, from Sam Kieth's vault.

Issue one looks great at any viewing size, but the original scans on issue two were very small (like 500 x 770) prior to the 'Restoration', so some of you will need to click them down a couple sizes to get a good image quality in your comic book reader. Still worth a look for the IS story and the portfolio pages.
