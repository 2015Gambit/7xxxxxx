Thanks everyone! 

Weird morning. Came over to the computer just now and saw that Windows hard done one of those ""we're going to make you update and restart whether you like it or not"" deals. Probably only happens, like, twice a year. So I'm thinking ""grumble, grumble! Going to be torrents that were stopped before they were properly seeded."" Then when I go to TPB, I've got a green skull! lol "
[M],BigDadE,2012-09-13T08:29Z,Cheers for your Green Skull!
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-13T10:05Z,"Thanks BigDadE and 'ThePirateBay'.

I had NO IDEA that receiving a skull would make the captcha disappear. Holy wow that's a HUGE amount of awesomeness right there!"
