I am getting the following error when tried to extract the iso with ultraiso for adding my drivers.

Last version has also given some problem.
Same problem when tried with winrar also.
Probably file name format error.
further , Request you to keep .network and also keep movie maker or separately provide as silent installers."
,Antraxy,2012-09-13T17:15Z,"This could be because the directory path is too long try to keep it shorter like WinXP_32-bit_BE.

You can also try to use 7-Zip or anohter Zip-Archive program to extract it if you have problems with UltraISO."
,LuxLOL,2012-09-13T21:26Z,Antraxy is right your extracting directory path is way too long. :-)

,LuxLOL,2012-09-17T02:36Z,"Yes the startup is the same it only has some extra WinXP Themes.
Make sure you do a format of your hard disk drive before reinstalling."

,LuxLOL,2012-09-20T12:25Z,"You can try another burn program like the ImgBurn, but you should first try this (Read Me file):
1. Burn the Disc at the lowest possible speed.
2. Don't use old scratched Discs.
3. Try to clean your Optical disc drive(s).
4. Use another Optical disc drive.
5. Try to install Windows XP from a USB Flash drive (WinToFlash)."
,llKoDoMoll,2012-09-21T14:39Z,how can I install this with out using CD or usb? please

,excalibur63,2012-09-22T20:41Z,No program (archiver or CD Burner) recognizes this file.  Tried it as is and also tried adding .iso to the end.  What am I doing wrong?
,LuxLOL,2012-09-23T02:04Z,"The downloaded file is a ZIP file and in there is the ISO file that you should extract.
To see the file extensions disable the option at:
START -> Control Panel -> Folder Option -> Hide extemsions for know file types"
,21egghead42,2012-09-24T00:28Z,"Need some help, I got it extracted, got it burned to CD using ImgBurn.

Now I did a test, used a single SSD (formatted correctly) and it can load.  But I have two mech. hard drives, I set them up as RAID0 in BIOS and in the Intel Matrix Storage area.  Windows XP loads, either using my Intel drivers or the Windows XP ones, then I get to the ""Welcome to Setup"" screen.  Hit Enter to install and it immediately says it cannot detect the drive(s)

It only works if there is just a single drive whether one mech. or one SSD.

Is this O/S for RAID or is there something else?  Both drives formatted (not quick), using ICH5R board which had a RAID set up.  I want to try out this version of Windows.

Can anyone chime in if they have installed this in a RAID?"
,21egghead42,2012-09-24T00:41Z,"Just tried another XP I had (not a spare though) and it works for RAID.

Any help would be great.

Again i tried using a floppy with the RAID drivers and also tried just using what the ISO has, no joy.  :-("
,LuxLOL,2012-09-24T05:28Z,I didn't had any problems last time with a RAID system but PM me over the website so i can send you a version without the RAID5 patch in it so you can try if that fixes your problem.
,21egghead42,2012-09-25T18:32Z,"okay, heading over to the forums area"
,NexisX,2012-09-26T23:34Z,"My intel drivers don't install properly in this.

Intel GM965 ftw."
,NexisX,2012-09-26T23:37Z,The Manufacture (Dell) provided default graphics drivers do complain of a modded dll file but I forget which one.
,NexisX,2012-09-27T00:05Z,"Ok the message I get from during installation of my intel GMA driver (manufacture default), which I get twice is "" The Application or DLL C:WINDOWSsystem32igmedkrn.dll is not a valid Windows image. Please check this againest your installation diskette."""

Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the start button, and then click search"". that's the reason why i cannot install windows until it finish. "
,LuxLOL,2012-09-27T21:47Z,Try to run a corrupt file check after you burned the disk to make sure no files on the CD are corrupt.
,poepveeg,2012-09-28T15:07Z,"Very very good!
