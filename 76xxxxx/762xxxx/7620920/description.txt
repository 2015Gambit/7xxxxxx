Our Cracked client comes with Rei's minimap mod and Faithful 32x32 texture pack already installed. Rei's mini map is a vital mod for playing SSP and SMP. If you choose to join our Multiplayer server he have already added a few handy way points and Faithful's texture pack is a much needed HD update on the default.
