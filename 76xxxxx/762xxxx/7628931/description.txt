A posthumous audio collection of Judi Bari's most poignant speeches and actions. As an IWW labot organizer and Earth First! Activist, Bari became a target for government and corporate repression. From her hospital bed just days after she was bombed (evidence points to FBI involvement); from the front lines of the timber wars, as well as on radio and in the lecture halls of universities. Her wit, humor, class-consciousness, and  organizing shine through on this release. She will be sorely missed, but in the words of her, and many others...ΓÇ¥don't mourn, organize!ΓÇ¥
