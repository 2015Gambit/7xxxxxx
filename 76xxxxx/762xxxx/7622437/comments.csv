,zophras43,2012-09-11T18:47Z,I'm guessing that this is the original DVD that all of the other DVD rips are based upon. Am I right?

,wildy63,2012-09-12T02:45Z,"@Agent666 - what is the easiest way to burn this?? I usually use ConvertX, but I can't get all the files to merge...."
,Agent666,2012-09-12T04:11Z,"@wildy63 - I used DVDFab - you can use it to remove all unwanted and then burn the folder to a standard DVD5 disc, that's assuming you want a standard DVD. Use DVD Copy, un-check what you don't want, put a standard DVD5 disc in and burn away!

If you don't have DVDFab, you can get it here:

This is a great program, I've been using it for many years!

I hope, that, this helps! "
,wildy63,2012-09-12T17:47Z,"Thanks Agent666, so weird... usually DVD Shrink works. Didn't this time, but I will give that a try!  :-)"
,xxLotusxx,2012-09-13T02:51Z,"Thx ;)
DVD9=better pic quality...but why remove the DTS=much better sound ?"
,lizardomanson,2012-09-13T15:16Z,"Video quality is good but not perfect, specially in black parts where some kind of compression, pixels or artifacts can be seen. That's if you are too picky about, so if you are then wait for a DVD9 to avoid compression."
