There are several ways to add a link from the browser to the program:
- tap on link and from a window "Complete action using" select the program (supported by Android Stock Browser and Dolphin);
- long press on a link cause the context menu, tap "Share link" and from a window "Share via" select the program (supported by Firefox and Skyfire), or tap "Copy link" and program service intercepts the link;
