MUST BE ROOTED!
MUST HAVE CYANOGENMOD THEME ENGINE!
Will NOT work on stock ROMs... Don't ask!

I run Inverted apps mostly and that's what this is tested on, so grab the inverted copy of the app you're thinking about complaining about! (Inverted apps are apps that once were white and now are black... all the backgrounds and fonts were swapped in color)

If you get a "Theme Improperly Compiled" error message... follow these steps:
Apply system theme
Reboot
Apply Theme (theme applies)
Reboot
Enjoy

What's in this version : (Updated : Sep 11, 2012)

Required Android O/S : 4.0+
