You kind folks are exactly what the Internet was supposed to be about.
Many thanks for the consistently high quality and pertinent programming.  May all your torrents seed at 10:1 and may all your VPNs never leak."

It's not normal for free documentaries to be only available to UK IP addresses. Discrimination, anyone?"

Yes, there's a massive shitstorm brewing. If we are able to continue discovering adapted antibiotics, fine, but I have the feeling Western science is hitting roadblocks and even regressing --- out of technical fields like computers, of course."
