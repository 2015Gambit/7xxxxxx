Breaking Amish is an American reality television series on TLC. The plot revolves around four Amish and one Mennonite young adults who move to New York City in order to experience a different life and to make a difficult decision regarding whether to return to their communities, or to remain in New York City and face potential ostracism by their family and friends.


The show follows the cast members as they experience the realities of living in New York City and face new situations involving work, friendship, romance, and lifestyle. It also tracks the drama that develops between cast members as they undergo various experiences. The move to New York City by these young men and women differs from Rumspringa, the rite of passage in which some 16-year-old Amish are allowed to experience the outside world and to decide whether or not they wish to remain with their home communities. Unlike Rumspringa, the move to New York City and participation in the show for the cast members was not sanctioned by their communities and may lead to them being shunned.
