Jo Jo is an Edinburgh Goodfella with a sharp mind and
a cavalier attitude to the law.
In the bleak, edgy climate of the 1980's Jo Jo is seen
by many on the estate as a hero; out-manoeuvring the
police while supporting his close-knit family.
What is it that draws the confident and charming Jo Jo
to Lorraine, a vulnerable woman obsessed by Marilyn Monroe?
What figure from his past is fuelling his fantasies and
driving him towards darker crimes and the quicksand of heroine.
Can Jo Jo look after himself when he doesn't know who he is...
