,TheRealKeyserSoze,2012-09-12T02:28Z,"You mean this is the x64 version, not x86."
,murphy78,2012-09-12T06:03Z,"Yes my apologies, this is x64. There are a few updates available that just got hotfixed on sep11, but I will not make a new version of this until the Tuesday patch day in October. So don't fear downloading this for the time being. "
,it.person,2012-09-24T03:53Z,"Hello murphy78, you don't need to add DirectX runtimes on Windows 7 SP1 since DirectX 11 was already included in Windows 7 when SP1 was released on March 18, 2010 and KB2533552 patch is not recessary, even if you don't install this update, future updates are enabled one way or the other."
