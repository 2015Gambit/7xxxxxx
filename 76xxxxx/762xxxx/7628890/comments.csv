,noelnyc,2012-09-15T19:41Z,"its look like windows without ...Windows Media Player, I know you removed it  why you have to do this..? "
[V],Maherz,2012-09-15T23:33Z,"@noelnyc
Do you read English? :)
Read description please.
Where does it say that I removed WMP?
:)"
,passerbyo,2012-09-17T01:45Z,ok thanks but is it possible to install this with usb flsh driv  using wintoflash 
[T],480v,2012-09-17T07:17Z,Your decision to replace ie6 with ie8 and remove messenger & msn is fine by me. (although not exactly untouched). But why must you add Flash Player 11.x?? Can't you leave that up to the user. If you really must insist on flash player then install 10.3 instead. It's WAY more reliable. 11.x always is always having issues. 10.3 is smaller as well.
[V],Maherz,2012-09-17T14:04Z,"@passerbyo
Yes, possible.

@480v
If you add something it must be the latest stable release ;)"
,passerbyo,2012-09-18T02:21Z,yes tested and working using wintoflash :)
,paulbras,2012-09-18T02:39Z,This looks great.....  Will it link up to windows and update with out any issues? This is exactly what i need!  Thanks for the upload. 
,paulbras,2012-09-18T02:51Z,where did my comment go? weird.  Can you tell me if this will update without any issues? thanks
,Rakeesh,2012-09-18T14:27Z,Does it need activation after install?
[V],Maherz,2012-09-18T19:52Z,"@paulbras
Yes, you can update it using Windows Update.

@Rakeesh
No, it's activated."
,HlTLER,2012-09-19T12:44Z,"This is awesome, thanks so much, I HATE the black edition, your's is the best."
,pbzone,2012-09-21T06:53Z,"@ Maherz wanna say TIA 
Will ready my client to DL SP3 after W7U is done
Thanks 4 the OS releases dude"
[V],Maherz,2012-09-23T20:14Z,"@HlTLER
@pbzone
Anytime guys ;)"
,TrekkerZ,2012-09-24T10:02Z,"Thanks Maherz, nice one.
I think you should consider this :
1. Very few people still using IE for their browser.
2. Flash Player update comes frequently."
,shawn998,2012-09-25T04:27Z,Can i install this if my computer does not have sata i have all normal ID drives
,daveo76,2012-09-27T08:26Z,I tried this and I kept getting so many error messages throughout the installation. Then when finish installation it kept getting the blue screen of death Also it wouldn't install network frames during the instalment. Then windows xp had to download it from it updates. I should had gone for the untouched windows xp sp3 from the start. Which gave me no problems at all. Windows iso files shouldn't be modified. It can lead to trouble 
[V],Maherz,2012-09-27T20:05Z,"@TrekkerZ
You're welcome.
1) Even thoug, IE should still be in  the system for those who uses it.
2) I know, but now it updates automatically.

@shawn998
Yes, you can.

@daveo76
Why everyone isn't having those problems? :)"

,DrMemory666,2012-09-29T11:51Z,"Hi.  I do appreciate the upload, just looking for the CD I can't find.

Do all note that this is a volume license version, and when I tried my OEM version key on it, it won't buy it.  So if you need to stick to your real CD key and have OEM, not going to help. :-("
[V],Maherz,2012-09-29T12:23Z,"@elex123
I'll check it when I log in to the forum.

@DrMemory666
Yes, it won't work."
