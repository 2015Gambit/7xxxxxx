This is the entire Mormon Temple Endowment Ceremony (with movie) that is in every temple in the world except the Manti, Utah and Salt Lake City, Utah temples. (Those two temples have temple workers act out the endowment ceremony instead of showing a movie in those two temples.) 


Mormons believe they must wear special underwear (which can only be purchased in special Mormon Church owned stores) and learn secret Masonic handshakes in order to go to Heaven. 

Take special note of the ΓÇ£Law of ConsecrationΓÇ¥ that is at the 58:40 mark. Mitt Romney has sworn to obey this oath countless times. Do you really want the President of the United States to be a man who has sworn to ΓÇ£consecrateΓÇ¥ all of his ΓÇ£time, talents and everything with which the Lord has blessed him with or with which he WILL BE blessed withΓÇ¥ to the Mormon Church?!?!

It seems to me that THAT oath might conflict with the oath of office.
