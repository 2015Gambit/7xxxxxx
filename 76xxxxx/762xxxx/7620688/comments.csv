[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-11T14:48Z,"@ibenimble

Due to the ridiculous and growing size of my library,I house my books on my server with a search engine,it's the only way I can house them without being overwhelmed.That's how my books are indexed 

There is software like ""Calibre"" that you can house your collection in,it's free and works well,I use it to convert books from one format to another.

You might want to google ''Indexing eBooks"" to see if you can find something on the subject :)"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-11T15:27Z,"@2010sj

I'm sorry,I don't have anything on ""Hugo Chavez"" at the moment

[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-11T15:37Z,"@romeo2539 

I have had many requests to upload that series again.The problem is that those files had the wrong file extension,instead of "".txt"" they were labeled ""epub"" so I thought they were epub.I don't know how that got by me but it happens and I'm sorry about that

I will try and get that series in ""epub"" and upload it as I don't have it on hand :)"
