,Jailroll,2012-09-11T02:44Z,"Hey T.T, wondering when ""An Epic, No Less will be included in your Bundles. And another thing I would like to ask is that I guess you missed that comment I posted on that Insyderz Torrent. Or I posted it too late but there is another ska band out there called ""Bunch of Believers"" Wondering if you can find them, great band... 

Thanks. And Keep up the great Work!!! :D

THE Jailroll."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T03:49Z,"Jailroll, yeah I've got those two bands someplace on my hard drives.  I've got a few other discographies in the works right now, but I'll spend a little time working on An Epic No Less and Bunch Of Believers for ya too.  :)"
,jboog3085,2012-09-11T05:28Z,Hey TT don't know if you put one up before or not but could you throw a August Burns Red discography up?
,jboog3085,2012-09-11T05:58Z,"Hey TT sry I forgot I wanted to ask you about another band, do you have any Starfield, if you do would love to see it up also, thanks again!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T15:23Z,"Jailroll, bad news of that An Epic No Less.  I wasn't aware they only had two releases.  One in 2010 and one in 2012.  I don't yet have the 2012 release, and I can't make a discography out of a single album.  So I'm going to have to hold off on it for a while.  I was also surprised to learn that Bunch Of Believers only has two albums out as well."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T15:24Z,"Jboog3085, I have access to 13 August Burns Red and 6 Starfield. I believe both discographies would be complete.  I'm working on them now, and will torrent them both for you in the days ahead.  :)"
,jboog3085,2012-09-12T05:02Z,Thank you sir its much appreciated!
,Jailroll,2012-09-14T04:20Z,Well I knew that An Epic No less is barely starting thats why I thought they would come up on your 2012 bundles and much thanks for the REAL B.O.B ^.^ My Ska collection is about complete
