NOT for iphone 4S

Just so you know."

,aeZ0bii7,2012-09-13T08:40Z,"Not from me, only downloaded the iphone 4 version since thats my current phone."
,Ander5,2012-09-14T08:00Z,Do you need to have an active Developer account in order to install/use the GM?
,aeZ0bii7,2012-09-15T08:59Z,No need to be an Apple developer. Anyone can install this.
