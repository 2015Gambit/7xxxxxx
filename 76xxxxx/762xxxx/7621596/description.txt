Ripped with the original 1920x1080 resolution.

Note the white noise on the audience shots - these were actually worse 
on the original video - I tried to denoise what I could without degrading
the quality.

The main feature, Plan 9 From Outer Space, has HD resolution, which makes
the difference in the RiffTrax Live BluRay releases.

Enjoy, and donate!
