,hardykyle,2012-09-26T15:53Z,"Season 9 is simply Season 8 after episode 8, as in s09e01 is just s08e09. Season 9 is the 2nd half of Season 8 that was relabeled ""the final tour"" after Tony announced he was ending the show. Most will probably be labeled as s08 not s09."
,Rokovak,2012-09-26T17:00Z,"Ok. But there still hasn't been any new uploads for a couple weeks now, and two more episodes have aired in that time. If I had a way to record and upload I'd do it myself, but I can't, so I'm just curious as to what's going on."
