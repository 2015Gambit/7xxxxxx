We now come to Problems in Physics by A. A. Pinksy. 

    This book offers the reader over 750 problems concerning the same subject matter as is treated in the two volumes of  the "Fundamentals of Physics". The order of presentation of the theoretical material is also the same.
   

The book was translated from the Russian by Mark Samokhvalov and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1980.
