The League of Legends Public Beta Environment is the beta version of LoL, created for users to test new champions and such for bugs before they reach vanilla LoL. Users are given frequent infusions of IP and RP. To play, you WILL need a PBE account, which can only be created on the 1st-3rd of each month. I advise you create several accounts, in case one gets banned or you have friends who want to play the Beta.

To install, place the extracted folder inside your League of Legends folder. Run lol.launcher.admin[the one inside the PBE folder]. It's updated through today[9/12/2012], but it updates VERY often, sometimes daily.
