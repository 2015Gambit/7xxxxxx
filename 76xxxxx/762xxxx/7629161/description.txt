Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy
In the past several years documentary filmmaker Gary Hustwit has made a trio of fascinating movies about design: Helvetica, Objectified and Urbanized. Taken as a whole they explore design in an elaborate fashion, ranging from the small (with Helvetica discussing graphic design and its tiniest details in typography) to the very large (cities and city planning in Urbanized). Hustwit is at his best when emphasizing the small details.-from the pixel of Helvetica's computer screens to the chairs and cars of Objectified to the roads and buildings of Urbanized-not a single detail will be missed. Every piece of our world, from smallest to biggest, is accounted for and explored for the vast amounts of thought, creativity, and pain that goes into its realization.


1)  Helvetica 
Helvetica is a feature-length independent film about typography, graphic design and global visual culture. It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which celebrated its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of urban spaces in major cities and the type that inhabits them, and a fluid discussion with renowned designers about their work, the creative process, and the choices and aesthetics behind their use of type. Helvetica encompasses the worlds of design, advertising, psychology, and communication, and invites us to take a second look at the thousands of words we see every day. The film was shot in high-definition on location in the United States, England, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France and Belgium.
