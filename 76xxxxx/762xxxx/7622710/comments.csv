,Dimmis80,2012-09-11T16:47Z,"Yeah good mate Scene another great release from u..;-)And some thoughts just my humple opinion for a matter.Ok Ryback this guy Rules..Tottaly.Very very strong and powerfull he is a beast.But a beast that did not test himself with for now with the other beasts of Raw/Smackdown like Big Show,Kane,Shena,Rock,Brock Lesnar and the list continues..If he manage to win some of them or a lot of them we will be talking for the next bst thing for the WWE.!For now ok with a lot of power he gets wins with the Indian guy..!And second clash or even third clash volunterrs wrestlesrs and stuff.We will see.!But for now-""Feed me MORE"".."
