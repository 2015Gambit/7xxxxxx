Requirements: Android 2.2 and up
Overview: Wake Up Screen is a fun, handy and useful tool app. It allows you to wake up the screen upon shaking the tablet or phone and saves the power and other buttons that you use to turn on the device.

IMPORTANT TO KNOW PRIOR TO INSTALLATION:
1. This app requires shake algorithm enabled devices.
2. This app requires ΓÇ£bootΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£keep screen onΓÇ¥ permissions upon installations.
3. This app may not function on rooted devices or third party ROMs that disable ΓÇ£wake screenΓÇ¥ activity.
4. This app uses between 4 to 8% of battery power and about 7 MB memory which is very low compared to system use. If needed, you can easily deactivate app processes to free up memory and battery use.

Finally: We encourage our users to contact us via email to discuss any concerns or suggestions regarding the app, if any. We cannot address review comments due to the fact that most negative comments that are left without prior contact with the developer are placed with the intent to lower app ratings and misguide the consumer.
