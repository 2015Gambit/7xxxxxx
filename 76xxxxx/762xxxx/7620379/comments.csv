,lahma,2012-09-12T20:03Z,"The tasker 1.3.1 apk you are hosting is IDENTICAL (same MD5 checksum) to the original trial version apk from the tasker website. And installing it over the old cracked apk you are hosting doesn't work. It gives an error and you must uninstall the old cracked apk before you can install the new trial. I suspect that is the case on all devices, but I am running Galaxy Nexus with Jelly Bean."

The only thing we can do for this is to take backup from the old data of previous version.Install the new version and restore only data.Then with sd maid pro we can freeze the app."
