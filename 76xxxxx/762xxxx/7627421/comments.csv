,macstar2012,2012-09-20T14:08Z,"lol..YIFY love your rips buddy, but got one suggestion if you don't mind. The rips you you produce are excellent and a lot of work goes into them, but the only thing i would love to see is 5.1 sound either added or as default. If you can do that as long as it does not screw up your process, my home theater and pc would love you, not that they don't already :) But 5.1 would make you my soul mate.."
