 CM8 Doing It Right The First Time
 
Source: French Retail DVD-R
 thx winnie13
 
Notes:
 
Took more than a day for winnie to upload that dvd that early, thx again for that
 In the meanwhile some groups who knew the dvd will be out soonish, decided to waste your bandwith with cam audio dubbed to the french low avi that was out earlier
 that was not nice, just to get some hits for the sake of uploading. wrong tagging, misleading tagging. i dont know, what a waste
 
I waited for the dvd to finish and made you a nice version from the source, if you want a quality rip here it is
 Also nobody mentioned so far the 10mins deleted scenes which are on the dvd, waiting to be watched
 they are included on my version as an additional avi, for you to enjoy too
 
Encode:
 
DVD had good quality, needed brightness,sharpness,contrast and rgb fixed, looks way better now. check the pics below
 There were 10 mins of deleted scenes on the disc, which are included now as a additional single file
 Made you some english subs for the hi
 
all in all a great quality rip, and will do me till bluray date in around 2 weeks or so
 
enjoy
