Overview: Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure


You tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. YouΓÇÖve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - theyΓÇÖre everywhere. Zombies. ThereΓÇÖs only one thing you can do: Run!

Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies youΓÇÖve collected while running to build and grow your base.

BBC NEWS - ΓÇ£The only way to save yourself is to run for real.ΓÇ¥
WIRED - ΓÇ£In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.ΓÇ¥
LIFEHACKER - ΓÇ£A really cool way to get outside and exercise.ΓÇ¥

WALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE
Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail.

What's in this version:
Fixed:
- We fixed the "missions not completing" issue that many players experienced this weekend. Your phone will now correctly show missions you've already run as completed.
New:
- LONG PLAY MODE. Do you run for more than an hour? Adjust your mission length to suit on the settings page.
- Seven supply missions that you can play again and again
- Review your runs - on the missions screen, choose "Run Logs" from the menu
