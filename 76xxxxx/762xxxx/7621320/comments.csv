,downants,2012-09-14T15:29Z,Does my Xbox has to be modded for that ?
,scetopismo,2012-09-15T00:30Z,"In my opinion, to play the demo's from xbox live you don't need modded console, so you just put it on usb using usbxtaf or horizon and play."

I put the demo file in Content 000000000000000 using usbxtaf in my usb but it shows up as a corrupted demo on the xbox."
