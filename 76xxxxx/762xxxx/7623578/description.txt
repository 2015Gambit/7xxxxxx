Overview: Easy unrar allows you to extract rar and zip files with ease. It has a browser to browse the files on your phone or your tablet.
In addition, Easy Unrar can also browse the files of an archive without decompressing. You can select files to extract.


Once extracted, the files can be directly executed in the application without using another browser.
