WEB-DL was simply a much much faster download.  The only Blu-Ray out there on torrent would have been the classic super super slow download with lots of peers and very few seeders.  I usually look around bitsnoop and find torrents with like 10-15 seeders and only a couple peers, and they download super fast.  And, in fact, there are episodes with spanish on them, so because the source is WEB-DL, the subs are hardcoded in, which is a plus.  Earlier, I was downloading the blu-ray episodes part by part via various file-sharing websites, but that was taking so long, so I went to torrents, and the only torrent I found that would have been a fast download was a random WEB-DL off bitsnoop."
,AGiX-HD,2012-09-13T07:33Z,"Thanks mike953100 for the kind and thorough reply, I perfectly understand your decision. As a side note I would recommend you sign up (or get invited) to some private trackers, most of them (dedicated to tv series or general) offer this in bluray (720p and even 1080p) with extremely fast DL speed. Anyway, thankyou very much for this :P"
