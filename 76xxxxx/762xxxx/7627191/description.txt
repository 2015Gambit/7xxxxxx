A review:

Shakira flawlessly reminds us why the sun comes out, when she's around, July, 2011
By Said Cruz "Firebolt" (San Diego, CA USA)

I was fortunate to see this amazing concert live. Shakira humbly reaches out to her fans throughout the entire night and is entirely devout to her audience. This performance shatters her stereotype as a "hip shaker". The stage set up was neat, Shakira was and continues to be the firework that makes the crowd roar. If you are a Shakira fan no need to convince you to buy because chances are you have 2 copies pre-ordered already, for everyone else this is a must have as a demonstration that true talent still exists. Not only did she deconstruct all her songs, she flawlessly re mastered them into a raw electric eargasm. Not to mention that she actually sings and dances from start to finish, there is no doubt that this petite woman packs the power of the sun not only in her voice but her soul as well. 5 stars does not do this justice!
Bravo Shakira que continue saliendo el sol!
