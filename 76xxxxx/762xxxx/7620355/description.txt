This is the official version from Mercedes, with Teleatlas (TomTom) Maps!

NTG 2 V.14 - 2012-2013
Part # A169 827 83 59

From my experience, the Teleatlas(TomTom) version is very bad in some countries (especially East Europe)
I recommend the Unofficial version of the DVD, with maps from Navteq.

You can get the Navteq version from here:
 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6970741/ or search on google for "Mercedes NTG2 Comand 2012 Navigation maps Europe, UNOFFICIAL"

Write the image using IMGBurn, Nero or Disk Utils (Mac) on a good DVD+R blank (Verbatim recommended)

Use 2.4x speed!
No advanced settings needed, as there is no protection.

Start the engine and insert the map DVD, wait 1-15 minuntes for the Command to reboot.
