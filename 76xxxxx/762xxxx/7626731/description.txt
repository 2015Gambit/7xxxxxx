How the Universe Works Series 2
The universe is made up of wondrous statistics that detail the incredible range between large and small, near and far, and light and dark - but what any of these inexact terms really describe is still open to debate. We are surrounded by laws that govern everything - determining the colour of the stars, the gravity controlling our solar system and the beginning and end of the universe itself.




8)  Birth of the Earth 
The Earth is an amazing place. It provides everything needed to sustain billions of creatures, plants and human civilization. We owe our very existence today to the planet's turbulent past. Our world was formed by a series of cataclysms, from the most powerful blast in the Universe to a planetary collision that could have destroyed it. Yet without these events, the Earth would not exist. Nor we. Could the same extraordinary chain of events have created other earth-like planets elsewhere in the Universe? Inhabited by creatures like us? The odds seem slim. But the incredible story of the birth of our world reveals that earths must be abundant. The question is no longer "are we alone" but "how far away are our neighbors?"
