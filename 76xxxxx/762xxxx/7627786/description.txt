These are the 5 booklets of the Blu Ray Disc release of Fam, The Silver Wing/Ginyoku no Fam.



They contain background information on the Last Exile universe, in addition to rich art boards.


They were not scanned by me, rather by an anonymous.


The files come in .jpg and .png formats, the quality is alright.
