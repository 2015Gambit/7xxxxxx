Discoveries from Ancient Civilizations:
Recordings from the visit of Francois du Plessis and Walter Veith to southern California in May of 2011. Topics covered include: the middle east; ancient civilizations, its people and their prophetic relevance today; rekindling the reformation; the church and political connections. Sponsored by the Beaumont Seventh-day Adventist Church, most meetings were held at the Loma Linda Filipino Church.

The video presents outstanding pictures alongside commentary while accurately describing historical Biblical events as found in modern archeological evidence and scriptures.  Enjoy!

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
