 What's in this version:
 Bug fix
 Widgetsoid need to be rewrite from scratch.
 I just start dev and it will take few month to get a new version.
 So version 4 of widgetsoid will be optimized, some bug will be fix and other bug will be new... But this new version was not compatible with widgetsoid 3.x so you will have to uninstall and install again widgetsoid.
 Thanks for your patience and your comprehension.
 If you want to test and help me with the new version please send me an email
