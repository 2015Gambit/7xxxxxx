DJ Sarcastic: Distort the Artifacts EP 

An Exorcise in Phonological Futility 

This 5-track EP finds Sarcastic at his most abrasive and inaccessible. Grinding distorted guitars meet archaic drums in an ashen no-man's land where culture and good taste evaporate in the dessicating wind of social unease. Confusion, pain and rebellion seethe through discordant layers of jagged noise.
