,hal4000,2012-09-13T13:52Z,"Cybergodsig, shut the fuck up. There's an ISO and there's flac files. Great upload. Thanks anonymous."
,tverlaine,2012-09-13T16:41Z,Superb upload ! First commenter is obviously a troll and a douchbag!
,tuubazz,2012-09-13T17:03Z,"Well look who's talking, cybergodsig. Why don't you shut your mouth and go back to seeding your torrents?

Try to understand, that YOU AND ONLY YOU can and MUST seed the file to 100% before others can take over. You can't just upload 30% and then cry out ""SEED!!!!!"" to other people. YOU MUST DO THE INITIAL SEEDING.

Now go and seed something right. Maybe then you'll earn the right to complain about other peoples torrents. Otherwise you are just an annoying asshat."

If you want DFF files; they are very easily extracted with Scarletbook. Then, if necessary you can convert them with KORG Audiogate to PCM (WAV or FLAC) Superb sound. Thanks again."
