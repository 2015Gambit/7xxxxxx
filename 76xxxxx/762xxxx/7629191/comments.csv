,MagiciansFR,2012-09-13T02:12Z,"Thank you so much for this. Since Demonoid went down, it's been hard to find lately published books and audio books. You wouldn't happen to know a good source would you? Other torrent sites pretty much suck as they throw all their books and audio books in together and you can't even filter for Sci-fi/fantasy. IRC is VERY limited and slow. Boy I miss Demonoid!"
