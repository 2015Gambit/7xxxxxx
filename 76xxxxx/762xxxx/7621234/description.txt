Synopsis - The new teacher at a severely administered boys' boarding school works to 
positively effect the students' lives through music.

This is the French film Les Choristes (The Chorus) with hardcoded English subtitles. The film 
is in 720p, and the audio is stereo 96kb. I made this movie because I wanted it for my collection. 
I figured I can't be the only person who streams their movies and hates it how the SRT sub files 
do not get picked up.

Please seed! And remember, sharing is caring!
