Best played on VLC Media Player.

Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users).

Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is (Find it in TPB itself) coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic.
