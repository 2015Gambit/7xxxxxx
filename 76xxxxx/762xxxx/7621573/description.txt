Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, September 10, edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the case of a commercial fisherman who was investigated by the cops for buying a few boxes of ammunition. 

He also talks about economy and how we are not being told the truth about the real economic condition of the United States as the globalists move forward with their takedown agenda. 

On today's show, Alex talks with New York Times bestselling author Tom Woods, a senior fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He is the author of eleven books, most recently Rollback: Repealing Big Government Before the Coming Fiscal Collapse and Nullification: How to Resist Federal Tyranny in the 21st Century.
