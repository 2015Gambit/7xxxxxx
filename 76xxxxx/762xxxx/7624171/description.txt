How the Universe Works Series 2
The universe is made up of wondrous statistics that detail the incredible range between large and small, near and far, and light and dark - but what any of these inexact terms really describe is still open to debate. We are surrounded by laws that govern everything - determining the colour of the stars, the gravity controlling our solar system and the beginning and end of the universe itself.



7)  Asteroids - Worlds that Never Were 
Asteroids have a bad reputation as deadly rocks from space. They wiped out the dinosaurs and will be back for us. But that's only half the story. Ancient asteroids built the Earth. And they may have brought life to its barren surface. Asteroids will shape our future as much as our past. They are the perfect location for deep space colonies and could be the stepping stones that eventually send humans out into the cosmos. From icy worlds with more fresh water than Earth to flying mountains of pure metal, a hundred miles wide, scientists are striving to unlock their secrets. Could these enigmatic space rocks hold the key to how life in the Universe arises and is extinguished?
