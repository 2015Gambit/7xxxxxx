                           DESCRiPTiON    

 Watchdog has been campaigning for consumer rights since 1980. It was orginally 
 a weekly slot on the BBC news programme called Nationwide. It was launched as 
 an independant programme in 1985.

 In 2009, the show was completely revamped. Anne Robinson returned as host, a 
 role she'd previously occupied between 1993 and 2001, alongside her was the 
 only survivor of the revamp Anita Rani (who was then replaced by Chris Hollins 
 in 2010) and Matt Allwright, who's show Rogue Traders now featured in a 
 condensed format as a item on the show. The show has also broadcast live from 
 here onwards.
                                 Enjoy!
