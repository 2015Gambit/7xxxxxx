,azynkron,2012-09-10T22:57Z,Appreciate your opinion.. but it would have been way more useful if you had given a A/V rating.

Thanks UltraTorrents!"
,moshster,2012-09-11T00:00Z,"Agreed.  For RIdley Scott, this is a terrible movie."

,Namorax,2012-09-11T06:37Z,"av? dude there are 179 copies of this on here today, if you havent figured out the av yet you arent too bright..."
,Talonkardex,2012-09-11T08:11Z,keep your opinion to yourself noone likes a hater
,ozeshin,2012-09-11T12:15Z,"Well if this IS the same version as all the other up's then the raters here need to put away the crack pipe...is it the same shitty cam audio as the rest?
With the useless pricks in the cinema sounding like they're partying rather than sitting the fuck down and watching the flick?
If so it's a very shakey 4.5...and I'm being fucking generous here..!!!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-09-13T08:36Z,"As always ViSiON has a very good rip.

A=9 V=10 [for a DVDRip]. 

This size was the choice of the ripper to obtain

QF [QualityFactor=Bits/[Pixel*Frame]=0.358 

not as usual an average 0.150-0.180

Cheers and Thanks."
