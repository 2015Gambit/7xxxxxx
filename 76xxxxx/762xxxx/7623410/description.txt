Notes:

Took more than a day for winnie to upload that dvd that early, thx again for that.
In the meanwhile some groups who knew the dvd will be out soonish, decided to waste your bandwith with cam audio dubbed to the french low avi that was out earlier.
that was not nice, just to get some hits for the sake of uploading. wrong tagging, misleading tagging. i dont know, what a waste.

I waited for the dvd to finish and made you a nice version from the source, if you want a quality rip here it is.
Also nobody mentioned so far the 10mins deleted scenes which are on the dvd, waiting to be watched.
they are included on my version as an additional avi, for you to enjoy too.

Encode:

DVD had good quality, needed brightness,sharpness,contrast and rgb fixed, looks way better now. check the pics below
There were 10 mins of deleted scenes on the disc, which are included now as a additional single file.
Made you some english subs for the hi

all in all a great quality rip, and will do me till bluray date in around 2 weeks or so.
