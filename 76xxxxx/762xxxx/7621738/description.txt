HOW TO INSTALL SIMS 2 (WITH ALL MAC EXPANSION PACKS) ON OSX LION

1. OPEN THE SIMS 2 DMG FILE AND COPY 'THE SIMS 2' FOLDER INTO APPLICATIONS

2. GO TO THE FIRST EXPANSION PACK "UNIVERSITY" RIGHT CLICK THE 'UNIVERSITY INSTALLER' FILE  

3. CLICK 'SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS' NOW GO TO THE RESOURCES FOLDER AND CLICK 'UNIVERSITY.PKG' 

4. INSTALL THE EXPANSION PACK AS FOLLOWS 

5. DO THE SAME WITH EACH FOLLOWING EXPANSION PACK
YOU CAN DO IT IN THIS ORDER (BUT REALLY IT DOESNT MATTER):
UNIVERSITY
OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
NIGHTLIFE
PETS
SEASONS
BON VOYAGE

6. MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD EITHER SEASONS OR BON VOYAGE SO YOU CAN GET A NO CD CRACK FOR IT !! 

7. FOR SEASONS TRY THE UBCRACKED.APP WHICH WILL WORK WHEN YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS !!

8. I STRONGLY ADVISE TO INSTALL BON VOYAGE AS IT MAKES LIFE EASIER AND ITS FUN

9. ONCE YOU HAVE INSTALLED ALL EXPANSION PACKS INCLUDING BON VOYAGE YOU CAN NOW USE THE 'SIMS 2 BON VOYAGE NO DVD CRACK' BY UNZIPPING THE 'THE SIMS 2' ZIP FILE IN THE BON VOYAGE FOLDER AND THEN PLACING THE 'THE SIMS 2.APP' FILE IN APPLICATIONS/THESIMS2/

10. YOU CAN NOW INSTALL THE STUFF PACKS IN WHATEVER ORDER

11. THE ICONS IN THE 'THE SIMS 2' FOLDER WITHIN APPLICATIONS MAY STILL HAVE THE WHITE 'POWERAPPS' LINE ON IT BUT DONT WORRY JUST DOUBLE CLICK 'THE SIMS 2.APP' AND IT WILL SURELY WORK :)
