I was able to get the source code for the Honorbuddy Authorization Server 1.4b.

However I am not good with C# so I thought I would share it so that maybe somebody who know C# can form this into a more up to date product.

I'm sharing this because it doesn't look like the project is being worked on any more and I know a lot of people would like to have it updated.

Any questions email hypozeus@gmail.com
