,openarena,2012-09-14T07:41Z,"why didint you upload 0.8.1.1 and o.8.1.2?

Id like to have all versions :))))"
,dejwbot,2012-09-16T13:32Z,"@openarena
I bought Gnomoria when it was 0.8.2 so I couldn't get earlier versions :)"
,Quayzar666,2012-09-20T03:26Z,Has anyone gotten this torrent to work besides the same 3 people?
,Alchem811,2012-09-22T23:21Z,"@Quayzar666 I have, the problem (if you could call it that) is that you have to rename the file to Gnomoria_v0.8.12.1.exe in order for it to run.  Hope this helps. "
,Alchem811,2012-09-22T23:24Z,"Also, (sorry for the doublepost) It's incredibly buggy, though I'm presuming that's not the torrent's fault but the game it'self. "
,epilepticow,2012-09-26T06:57Z,"please upload the latest version, nice job with the others.

thanks"
,PwnFrog,2012-09-27T02:19Z,"Guys, I uploaded the very latest version here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7676607"
