,flamesong,2012-09-11T14:55Z,A list would be useful/nice.
,oneslider,2012-09-11T19:08Z,"Your right it would flamesong.
But either typing in 46 file names or copy and pasting them is more time than I have, so download and be thankful."
,jakefreed,2012-09-11T19:10Z,I agree with flamesong. Maybe somebody who has downloaded?
,oneslider,2012-09-11T23:01Z,"And when you get the list what will you do, Ohhhh I only want six of the files, you still have to download the whole DMG.
Has common sense died?.
It's 374Mb, Stop whining, jeeezus."
,qskenzer,2012-09-11T23:11Z,LOL......so true! Thanks for the upload
,iPlunder,2012-09-13T14:16Z,"I don't care what your excuse is for not including a proper description, you're either lazy or inept, and it sounds like both. Thanks for sharing, but if you aren't able to include a description, then you shouldn't be uploading.

Are you aware you could simply select all the files and past them into a text editor, and you'd create a list? Took me about 5 seconds.

BTW, this is the SAME collection that was uploaded a year and a half ago and is still being seeded.     http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7621056/Screensaver_Collection_OS_X.dmg

Since I couldn't tell what was in this, I downloaded it and it turned out to be the same thing I downloaded last year. That's 392 MB of wasted bandwidth for TPB and myself.

,iPlunder,2012-09-13T14:31Z,"Great, NOW my first attempt at posting a comment shows up, as soon as I submitted it again. It showed up then disappeard so I re-posted. Sorry 'bout that.

Of course there was no wasted bandwidth on TPB's part since they don't host the files, I should have said it wasted the seeders and peers bandwidth."
,oneslider,2012-09-14T06:36Z,"@ iPlunder.
Your so much better than me and everyone else, run for office.
Ohhh and BTW, this is a DMG ""I"" made not a copy of anyone else's, if there is another, it's pure coincidence.
But I don't expect you to believe that of course, you'd have trouble believing very much at all.
Unless of course you said it or wrote it."
,iPlunder,2012-09-14T10:00Z,"Sorry, I guess you did add to the original - it only contained 26 savers.

And I goofed and posted the link to this torrent, not the other. I used a short url, but TPB wouldn't let me post it so I had to change it to a full url and then I copied yours by mistake. That's what I get for typing at 1:30 in the a.m. (Ha - it's 1:00 in the morning now).

The other torrent is here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6277632/The_Ultimate_MacOSX_Screensaver_Collection__Shockwave_

My point was that no one should upload a torrent without a description, especially if it's a compressed file and you can't see a list of what's in it. It wastes people's time and bandwidth ddownloading things they may not want. IMO that should be a PirateBay rule.

Hopefully you learned something and can now quickly make a list from filenames. You can also use an app like Print Window to do it (free for private use). http://searchwaresolutions.com/

BTW, Snow, Strands and Ignis Fatui are demos."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-15T16:23Z,"Seems to me as if the majority has spoken, not to mention the fact that the quality marker up there indicates that this pretty much sucks simply because of the laziness and rather catty / bitchy response from oneslider.

Frankly, I think a list would've been nice ... but ... it is what it is.  Too many uploaders fail to give even the most basic of information, which is (IMHO, essentially due to disregard and laziness) kinda sad.  Seems like a great torrent, to be honest.

Major kudos to iPlunder for making the effort - and taking the time - to give the information that oneslider should've provided in the beginning.

oneslider?  Appreciate the effort on your part, but dude ... it requires very little time or effort ... you've got some good torrents out there, so why ruin it all (and your work) by being such a smart-ass? Say ""Thank you"" to the folks who comment ... constructive criticism and all."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-15T16:25Z,"This comment right here:

""Your right it would flamesong.
But either typing in 46 file names or copy and pasting them is more time than I have, so download and be thankful.""

The mark of a childish asshole.  Is that how you REALLY want to come across to people on here?  If so, then continue by all means ... and then somewhere down the line, folks will probably quit downloading your stuff.

YOU should be the one who's thankful ... NOT us."
,oldr_4_me,2012-09-16T19:19Z,"Wow, I suppose that obtaining a great deal of ScreenSavers for nothing out of pocket was not good enough for a few out there...you probably want someone to install each one for you and then tell you if you like it or not.  In the absence of a list start the torrent download and then check the contents of the package under file header.  Don't want them just cancel the transfer.  Think things through and STFU."
,oldr_4_me,2012-09-16T19:35Z,ClubQBall...your comment made no sense whatsoever...why would the individual making the effort to upload a torrent for you be the one who is thankful?  Thankful that you just might be the special one that he can provide you with something free and then have you be critical as well?!  Perhaps pulling your head out might help regain some logical thinking?
,ClubQBall,2012-09-16T20:28Z,"@oldr_4_me ...

Apparently you lack the necessary reading and comprehension skills to fully understand the gist of my post.  So, until you can develop more than an elementary and rudimentary grasp of ""See Spot run"" reading abilities, I suggest you stick to ...

MINDING YOUR OWN MOTHERFUCKING BUSINESS.

I wasn't speaking to you, now was I, genius?  NO, I wasn't ... so, kindly, go sit down over there in the corner, pound your pud a little longer, have a Coke and a smile, and just shut the fuck up, you silly-ass twat.  

Goddamn, I loathe motherfuckers who think they know it all ... and DON'T."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-16T20:33Z,"Oh ... and oldr_4_me?  It's not the point about ""getting something for nothing"".  Had you been able to actually fully understand the point of all the posts thus far, you might've been able to ascertain that we were complaining about a list if what the uploader FAILED to include.

Thanks to iPlunder, we have that list.

Are you REALLY that fucking stupid, shit-for-brains ... or do you just enjoy being a smart-ass - yet completely simple-minded and clueless - randomly posting on uploaded torrents?

Fuck off, asshole.  Go elsewhere ... and learn to speak only when spoken to."
,oneslider,2012-09-17T04:31Z,"Hey, ClubQBall.
When I want your opinion I'll give it to you.
You lost your argument.
Download it or not.
Personally I don't give a shit."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-17T13:21Z,"Hey, oneslider ... LMGDFAO.  Is THAT the *best* you can come up with?  Fuck you and that sway-backed nag you rode in on, you silly. simple-minded lugnut.  I didn't ""lose"" shit ... LOL.  Your torrent is shit ... and apparently 18 other people agree with me.  Who's the loser now, fucktard???"
,HITECH_DUDE,2012-09-18T16:25Z,Now-now children... let's all just get along.  You should all insert a tampon and move on.
