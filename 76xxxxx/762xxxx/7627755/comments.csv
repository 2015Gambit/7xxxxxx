Guess I can just quit looking over at SU, eh?  Every day I go there first, hoping beyond hope to see some new 2040 goodies..."

There would be fewer and fewer new encodes/uploads. 99% of new uploads here are in fact re-uploads of things I have already and is seeded on SU (still are) -  but after fresh 'fiasco' where just handful people there seeded back - I can't rely on uploads to SU anymore."

But, I'm still grateful for what you put up, no matter where you do it.

cheers!"
