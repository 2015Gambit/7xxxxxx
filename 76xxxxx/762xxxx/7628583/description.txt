Information
------------------------------

Journey into lush jungle foliage, up fog-bathed mountains, under flaming desert sands, back in time. How would it feel to be the first one, to be a bold explorer, to make a one-of-a-kind discovery? Return to the golden age of exploration as five men set out into the world to make their names. This exciting five-episode Discovery Channel series will take you to South Africa, the Gobi Desert, the Andes Mountains, Egypt's Valley of the Kings, and the islands of Crete and Santorini to discover the missing link in human evolution, the bones of new dinosaur species, the lost city of the Inca, the undisturbed tomb of King Tutankhamun, and the lost civilization of the Minoans.


1)  Skull Wars - The Missing Link 
In the early 1920's, Professor Raymond Dart uncovers a tiny skull in a South African quarry that ignites one of the greatest controversies of 20th Century science. Believing he has found the Missing Link in the evolution from ape to man, Dart's theory directly challenges the prevailing wisdom of British Anthropology and Dart is soon pitted against his former mentor in a bitter battle over whose theory of evolution is correct. From struggle and heartbreak to triumph and the discovery of an astonishing scientific fraud, Skull Wars chronicles an epic tale from the Golden Age of Exploration--a tale that changed the very story of mankind.
