I've contributed over 300 torrents, reported fakes, worked hard, got me my pink skull. Its time to give back yet again. Musically this time. And if you'll notice and you've been paying attention, I....never upload music here. And I'm not sure who's all who here, but I dunno if a pink skulls ever uploaded their own full album here. But here goes anyways...Why you ask? Cuz the world needs to dance and sing. With that being said. N2KMaster presents his first released full album in MP3 format my most successful songs that I've produced, remixed, and collaborated on. I never ever wanted to earn money from my tunes. Nothing more than spinning on main street with a laptop and a can for the change to be thrown into. Since I'm not out to earn any profit from these, where can i possibly go to pitch a good idea....Where have i gone before to release the coolest stuff in my vast collection....Where indeed! 12 songs, free to the happiest place on earth....Pirate Bay

Love you kiddies....N2KMaster.

PS - Please help seed, music should be free and that wing nut who sat at the campfire and went ooga booga and then thought "Hey i should charge money for this" should be shot in my opinion.....A friendly opinion would be nice as well. I give this in love in hopes love comes back. I could never give enough for the main page or to have people help out with my album, doesn't mean it doesn't deserve a place here.
