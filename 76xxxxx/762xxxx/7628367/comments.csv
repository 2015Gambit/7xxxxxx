The ones who are interested, my guess is they wouldn't have no problem muxing them into the mkv container.
Thank you for sharing!"
[T],HighCode,2012-09-13T21:26Z,"I was probably the only one who added the optional audios separate (see older multi...[mkvonly] torrents) and folks were bitching about it ( comments like ""...where is the God damned sound?...you f**ing idiot"".. and didn't raise your voice (or others) then saying you're glad to have them separately. 
People will never be satisfied even with free staff.
People find it easier to blame others then to fix the problem themselves. Muxing/demuxing mkv-s is too much work for them poor boiz."

As for not standing on your side when some morons complained, I'm sorry but I wasn't aware of such ungrateful pricks, and I think that is one of our moderators' job to ban the cavemen back to their cave... Just one more thing; I'll give you an example that I congratulated you regarding the way you encode the movies, and hoped that others would follow your footsteps: thepiratebay.se/torrent/6803223/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoos_Nest_1975_720p_multi_%5Bmkvonly%5D
Keep up the good work, and hope that are more like me to change your mind..."
