,dududus,2012-09-14T02:24Z,"Does this work with DEX?

Ie is it worth installing the DEX 4.21 firmware to play this?"
,checkinboarder3,2012-09-15T05:11Z,"Thanks Alik0.

@dududus: You can play every single 4.x game on DEX as long as they have an official update PKG that you can either fix manually with some tools or use a n00b-tool (that I think is out since last week).

It's totally worth it, specially for some of the games to come. Think right now of this, NHL, FIFA, Sleeping Dogs, and so on (and not only that but also playing things like Skyrim, if not fixed on 3.55 with latest PSN update on 4.x firmware)."

,Betelguise,2012-09-23T22:36Z,"Seed please , more !"
,dududus,2012-09-25T04:27Z,"I recommend this fix:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7659052/BLES01702-Tekken_Tag_Tournament_2_%28v1.01_Fix%29.rar

1. does not overwrite any game files, ie nothing is modified
2. updates to v1.01
3. does not change region to JAP unlike the eboot fix.

Download and run the pkg on your PS3, thats it! Ignore the SFO file."
