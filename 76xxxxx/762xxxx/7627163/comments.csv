Install the application. Make sure the program isn't running. Go here: C:Program FilesWondershareVideo Converter Ultimate and minimize. Open Crack directory, right click ""VideoConverterUltimate.exe"" and select ""Copy"". Then maximize the Video Converter Ultimate directory you just minimized and paste ""VideoConverterUltimate.exe"" overwriting the file that's already in there. 
Done!! "
