Called 'Festival of the Flame', the Closing Ceremony of the London 2012 Paralympic Games celebrates the exuberance of festivals and the changing of the seasons. British band Coldplay, one of the world's bestsellling music acts, lead the evening's celebrations with a live concert.

Coldplay have been working with Artistic Director Kim Gavin and ColdplayΓÇÖs live show co-designer and Paralympic Games Closing Ceremony designer Misty Buckley to play a set of their most iconic music alongside a cast of almost 2,000 in the Olympic Stadium. The Closing Ceremony celebrates the achievements of the 4,200 athletes at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, and includes a Handover to Rio 2016 and the extinguishing of the Paralympic Flame, signalling the end of the Games.
