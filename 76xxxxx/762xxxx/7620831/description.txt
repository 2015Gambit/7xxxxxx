Description:

Dr. Adrian Rogers as part of Love Worth Finding, which began in 1987, Dr. Rogers states "I believe God wants us to proclaim the message of salvation in the power of the Holy Spirit by every means possible ... That's our commitment at Love Worth Finding." In response to many who are asking, has that purpose changed since the home-going of Dr. Rogers? No, God wants us to continue to proclaim the message of salvation. The messenger may be gone, but the message must continue. Millions still have not heard the precious name of Jesus or know His redeeming grace.

So our race is not over. We must still run -- until Jesus comes. If you believe in what God has called LWF to do, we invite you to help us proclaim God's truth. Our prayer is that you will join with us in running the race and in broadcasting the Good News that Jesus Christ is truly the greatest Love worth finding.
