Yeah, I think the description I included and maybe some peoples lack of knowledge regarding Henry and Glenn (man, I am getting old) might be keeping them away from this book. But if you know ANYTHING about Henry and Glenn (PARTICULARLY 'I'm Glenn Danzig, I'm short but I'm tough, look at these muscles!') it's pretty damn funny."
