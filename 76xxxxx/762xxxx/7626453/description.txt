"Sarcastic gives it up and turns it loose with this very literally titled 12-track release from the depths of his crates. Sarcastic doesn't subscribe here to any one identifiable genre, melding the many, many samples employed into an exercise in musique concrete that should perhaps be described as uneasy listening... Sharp ears shall remain tuned-in to this for a long time." (Darcy MacDonald, Montreal Mirror Vol. 27 No. 49)
