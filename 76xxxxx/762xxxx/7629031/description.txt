And here you go, on request for JJ and Alice to upload this, their work on the complete Lanfeust of the Stars, a sequel to Lanfeust of Troy (of which we just need 1 album out, then I will up that too).

Lanfeust of the Stars is another great series from Christophe Arleston, who also made The Shipwrecks of Ythaq, which I already posted.


On the planet Troy, everyone has different magical powers. Our hero, Lanfeust, use his power in amazing adventures.
But it cause interest from outer space, and one day, the pretty agent Ice shows up in a spaceship, and inform him that he and Thanos are the result of an experiment with psychic powers, and soon our hero, along with Cixi, Hebus, and Thanos, are off to the stars.
