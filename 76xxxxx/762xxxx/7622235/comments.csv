,lontrus,2012-09-11T09:32Z,why the name was changed back to just american chopper but in tvrage and like sites still have it as sr vs jr
,mars696969,2012-09-11T09:37Z,thank you my friend great timing :D +1
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T09:38Z,"Not sure why mean.. they name is correct
why would they change it back to the old name
cos they made up?

since they 2 operations not one roof they cant rename it back.. wouldnt make sense

but you could call it season 10 and sub name snr vs jr.. I put all mine under am chopper like that"
,mars696969,2012-09-11T09:42Z,how many ups roughly do you need to even get a trusted skull ? just wondering
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T09:44Z,"remember theres fake seeds on the trackers not sure if tpb is doing that to throw off spies

but just me seeding and seeing already some leeching and slowing it down... 100kb.s should be possible will take 1 hour to seed out no doubt though"
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T09:46Z,"other vips or mods have to promote you
theres no set number I suspct a month have to be a member like other sites unless special case but its more on variety of shows you share and how many a day up like 4-5 

espc missed scene episodes and rare stuff"
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T10:11Z,"so why no p2pmules added the scene mp4 yet?

seems im the only one sourcing and converting stuff found else where on the web lately

and the media spies think closing p2p sites down will have a impact on sharing stuff? hardly"
,lontrus,2012-09-11T10:19Z,"well in facebook there is a commercial as dont forget to change your recording name back to shorter version as american chopper .. it just got my eye few weeks ago

but well thats not importent anyways how the name look like"
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T10:27Z,"still the comments dont always show here LOL


remember I dont do 729p and mp4s only xvids

if fact lucky Im uploading this as Im over my data cap big time again"
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T10:29Z,right might have a watch of this episode now my self I did do random preview and check for sync issues before sharing.. why I spotted the left in ADs and removed them
,mars696969,2012-09-11T10:41Z,sweet cheers bro just wondering how it works :)
,beechyboy,2012-09-11T14:18Z,"Thanks for the upload.

Lontrus is right about the name. It's just American Chopper now.
Check out the official web site -> http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/american-chopper/"
[V],psspss,2012-09-11T15:09Z,"well thats lame changing it back I think
they are still competiting for business
so its still VERSE

and messy for naming now

so I guess its going to be called Season 7 and not 10 now right? cappers.. hmm.. "
