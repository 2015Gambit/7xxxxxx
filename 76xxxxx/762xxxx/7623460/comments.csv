,Xiaopangzi,2012-09-12T05:22Z,"This upload contains four files that I have desperately wanted, except that it includes the 6th edition rather than the prefered 7th edition of Wheelock’s Latin. It does not include the new “Workbook for Wheelock’s Latin,” “Scribblers, Scvlptors, and Scribes,” “Cumulative Chapter Vocabulary Lists for Wheelock’s Latin,” or the new “Readings from Wheelock’s Latin.” Nevertheless, I really appreciate this upload!"
