This is a modified version of Firefox Portable coupled with Torr Browser Bundle, combined with X-Pidgin, qBittorrent, PuTTY, FileZilla, Skype, Mozilla Thunder Bird, and Server2Go masked by the Torr Network and more to protect your privacy online. And be a bit of a file leech at the same time.

Requirements:

Windows XP/XP 64/Vista/7

I dont have full linux port yet for it, firefox is giving me issues. The entire thing is portable. Firefox is modded for faster surfing, ripping entire backdoors to file folders online (it will stun you when you see on some sites whats all running), it will rip all the streaming sites, file lists, txt, php, html, right down to the css and js even. Various checkers to keep you safe online, and if all else fails a back up bit defender virus checker's built right into firefox for you.

Its fully portable, just extract to your usb drive instead of your hard drive.
