[T],n2kmaster,2012-09-19T04:24Z,"Thanks guys. The entire idea is based around the original tor browser bundle when they had Pidgin included with it. Then i started sniffing around for what is portable and would set the proxy settings in stone. While the programs individually are not my creation. The hand tweaked firefox setup, bookmarks, presets to the browser, the menu launcher itself, thats all me. Facebook freaks all the time on it to cuz it can't recognize ya and I've had a couple prompts from google for a cellphone number to contact me to make sure its really me. So if thats any inclinations how secure you're gonna be, google and facebook 1/2 the time don't even recognize you, your device or ip address. I noticed they ran into a problem with the firefox bundle they created where the torr button can't be disabled anymore (some flaw in firefox) The FoxyProxy plugin preset to torr was the solution. I really wish it would port to linux, i cant get it to do it (My skill level, not impossible)
Sorry for those with low res monitors, the menu was built on a monitor at 1600x1200 for poster work for indy wrestling and i work beyond HD."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-09-19T04:26Z,"Also people ask ""Why the kill switch"", you've obviously never worked with proxies and firefox before. I got hangs and everything during the V1-3 testing, i needed an option just to click, shut er down, restart again, without the program hanging. The Do Not Continue button is for those having problems with the program hanging in memory, it kills all the processes it could be running and then kills itself."
