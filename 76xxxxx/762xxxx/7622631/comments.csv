We're a very small team who dumped 3 years of our lives and a lot of money into making this game, and it has not been selling quite as well as we were hoping for. We really need the sales if you want us to continue making games, and we want to continue making games, so if you enjoy it please feel free to support the game and spread the word and stuff.
