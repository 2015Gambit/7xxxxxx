Episode 15: Vacation, All I Never Wanted
The "girls' trip" continues to unravel, as a double date drives a wedge in the group.
While Aviva, Reid, Carole, and Russ are busy setting up a double date, Ramona realizes that the girls trip she thought they were on has definitely turned into a couples retreat. As Carole tries to explain to Ramona that it will be a quick dinner, the discussion quickly escalates and takes a turn for the worst when Aviva walks in. On the final night, the women go out for an early drink before taking off to see Russ perform, but Sonja and Ramona add fuel to the fire when they opt to return to the villa instead of going to the concert.
