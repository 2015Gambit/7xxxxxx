No 720p version coming? like the cowboys/giants game you uploaded?"
[V],Nepotu,2012-09-12T10:51Z,I'm sorry but the ripper made only the 540p version of this game.
,thankyo,2012-09-12T18:30Z,Thank you very much for sharing. Good quality even for a 540p. A 720p would be nice if possible. Appreciate very much the effort. Looking forward to your next Chargers rip.
[V],Nepotu,2012-09-13T15:30Z,you're welcome and thank you! Sorry for the 720p!
