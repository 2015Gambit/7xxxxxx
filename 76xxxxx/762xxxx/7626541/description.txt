Book Description

Even as data is turning the world upside down, the next revolution is taking shape: realtime data analysis. Data tools like Hadoop are batch-oriented; theyΓÇÖre good at taking a set of data, analyzing it, and giving you the result later. But these tools are not particularly good at handling streaming data: data that is constantly arriving, and results that are changing as fast as the data arrives. Storm is a new tool that solves that problem. This book gets you started with it.
