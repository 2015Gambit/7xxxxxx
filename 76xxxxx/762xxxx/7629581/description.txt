Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the September 12, 2012 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the murder of the ambassador to Libya and three members of his staff by al-Qaeda. 

He also talks about the latest mechanical monstrosity produced by DARPA, a robot that will be used to track and kill people. Additional news includes the latest on the downfall of the dollar and continuing bad omens for the beleaguered euro zone. 

On today's worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with best-selling author, political commentator and policy adviser to president Reagan, Dinesh D'Souza. He is the author of The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11.
