[V],psspss,2012-09-13T05:43Z,"i see scene have mp4s out now took their time

ep10 is good but ep9 you might want to replace with a 1000bit version as I could only get 300bit one which causes pixels on movement

as I know some will moan at my rips quality

im not in usa after all so shows anyone can sourcer a tv show and make it if they try

its more risk as a uploader doing it though"
