Who knows if it's theft but its awesome that this torrent is now the #4 most leeched HD movie on TPB after MIB 3, Snow White and the Huntsmen & The Avengers! Those movies probably cost $200m each and we only spent $150k on ours! Suck it big studios, although hiring Whedon for the Avengers was brilliant."

,Desu7x,2012-09-13T05:56Z,Love the fact that SG is embracing this instead of auto-hating and lawyering up or some shit.

It you download the film and dug it, go give them some love!  Stop by their shop and grab a shirt, some stickers, another film or sign up to become a member!  It's not to support hot tattooed and pierced women!"
