Long Tall Sally by The Beatles was their fifth official EP release, and the first British EP that included songs not previously released on an album or single in the United Kingdom[2] (two of the tracks had seen an American release earlier in the year on The Beatles' Second Album, with the other two released on the North American album Something New). It was released by Parlophone in mono with the catalogue number GEP 8913 and released in the UK on 19 June 1964. It was also released in Spain and France.
