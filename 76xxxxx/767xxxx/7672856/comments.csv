,Savre,2012-09-26T14:58Z,"A/V = 9 M - 6

Quite boring and unbelievable. Its just that you never believe the main character can do what they make him out to be, a hard core killer. The action scenes are weak and the relationship between the two leads never goes anywhere. 

You sort of get the feeling that this might have a kind of Bourne style to it but it never gets there. The action scenes just weren't believable and you feel let down. I wouldn't recommend. "

,milgaviel999,2012-09-26T23:56Z,"@mwcrutcher Chill out please - all you're doing is making yourself look silly with big rude swearwords that you wouldn't say to anybody's face.

Thank you uploader for the upload, thank you people who have left file quality opinions and thank you those who have given their opinions about the film itself.  

I'm going to download but I don't expect to be enthralled, but I also don't expect to be bored to death. Here's hoping I will be pleasantly surprised. And of course I'll seed."

you the man who decides the rules?
can't see that written anywhere, that it's only made for ""quality rates"", and I believe the intention is that the commentary field is made for any comments about the specific torrent.

since he is just giving his opinion about the quality of the movie as a whole, he is absolutely fine to do so, and if you don't like it, just skip reading that part.

but that was just to friggin hard for ya, wasn't it, troll?"
,Jaymark_prs,2012-09-28T23:02Z,"It's fricken hiklarious how ppl on here complain about ""zionists"" and have no real undestandign about what the synagogue of satan real is and the Jews that are in it. There are zionists, yes, but they are the Jews that involves themselves with the Illuminati and seek to enslave mankind. The Jews that are not part of this group are just as deceived as the rest of the world. And so, what are we to do?Are we to generalize a whole ppl group just bcuz of a few and follow either extreme racist ethnocentric madmen( and believe me I see nothing wrong with healthy racism that celebrates it's own culture and preserves that culture. I just dont see a need to exterminate ppl based on their race. Separatism that is peaceful and healthy...no problem). or just as equally mad the Islamist jihadists that want to convert everyone to extremeist islamic shiteism or else be put to the sword! Ha! Wake up! Learn and research what ou speak against before spouting off like some radical idiot! I find it equally hilarious that ppl that curse out zionists and then come on here to fill their minds via movies by ""so-called"" zionists and then write in the comment section og their disdain for the makers of such films! It seems they are not only ignorant but also hippocrates!"

,piranical,2012-09-30T15:01Z,"v9a9 m...agree with Future_TV & note to zionists/hollywood/whomever the fuck directs these movies - if you are going to make a movie based around a hardcore surreal jesus christ come rambo cia assassin and weapons expert, it won't blow your budget to get your main actor to point the gun where he's looking ie straight out in front of his line of vision and not up in the air...unless he's a hardcore killer of ducks.
