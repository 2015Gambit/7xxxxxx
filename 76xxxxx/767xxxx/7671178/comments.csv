,HEAVEN13TH,2012-09-25T20:53Z,Darn. Mine stopped at 96.5% also.
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-09-26T00:17Z,"It's not corrupt, the people RayCort seeded it downloaded it and didn't seed much in return so there is nobody else with the full file, all the people trying to download it have 96.5% of it. RayCort needs to return and seed it, since they have the full file."
,HEAVEN13TH,2012-09-26T00:50Z,Meanwhile I'm still seeding a lot of the older Hollywood Heights. Those hit and run buggers. lol.
