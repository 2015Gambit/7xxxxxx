,dontlikefake,2012-09-26T20:44Z,where are the seeders for this
,talbot10,2012-09-26T22:14Z,Thanks! Subtitles??
,dontlikefake,2012-09-26T22:30Z,"hmmm  im starting to think that this might be 
FAKE FAKE "
,ItaloDiscoManiac,2012-09-26T23:30Z,"1. It's not a fake. But you have to be patient because, until now (23:21 CET), I've uploaded... let's see... 1800 MB. I guess tomorrow morning (September the 25th), It'll be OK. Please?
2. NO subtitles;
3. And THIS IS MY FIRST, MY LAST, MY ONLY comment - I will respect my promise, seed 24/ 7 until 2012 Christmas.

CHEERS!

P.S. @dontlikefake: Jesus Christ! Didn't know TPB have a Police department... So you're here only to verify the torrents' status... Mine has (now) 3 seeders, 11 leechers. Would you... will you... kindly FUCK OFF?? Bloody wanker..."
,dontlikefake,2012-09-26T23:35Z,3 seeders?  hmmm  i dont think so  there not even 1 seeder seeding this
,dontlikefake,2012-09-26T23:39Z,"no, you FUCK OFF dumbass"
,dontlikefake,2012-09-29T00:15Z,by the way this is going which the download is very very slow as there is not any seeders to help us. it looks like that we are going to be here this time next year trying to get this downloaded
,zee_searcher,2012-09-29T16:09Z,"checking zee uploader's IP you can see he/ she's from Spain (hello, neighbour!), a country which holds one of zee slowest & most expensive ADSL in Europe; & worst, zee number ""2"" at zee beginning of zee adress means ""Wi-Fi"". so zee only chance is that smbd will finish zee dnld or smbd (a computer-savvy) will teach zee uploader how to fasten zee upload (by doing i-dunno-what with zee band width or other things - you see that he/she's using BitComet 1.34).

np, i'm not in a hurry

... but zee waiting is SOOO boring!"
,dontlikefake,2012-09-30T02:24Z,i must say that it is moving up. but very very very slowly and everyone is on 4.6% beacause there aint no seeders.. so if it keeps like this then we will be waiting untill next year to get this done lol
