And with our expert's assessment, they will find out their chances of survival if their worst fears become a reality.


12)  Extra: American Doomsday 
America's Doomsday plan. It's the government's ultimate playbook, with a strategy for even the darkest hours-developed when Cold War tensions were high, but never used until 9/11. In American Doomsday, fly in an E4-B-the president's command, control, and communications centre for times of national catastrophe; go inside the secret bunker used by government officials on September 11; and witness how the luxurious Greenbrier Resort became a critical, top secret congressional bunker.
