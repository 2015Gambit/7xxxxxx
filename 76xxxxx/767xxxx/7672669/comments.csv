,JauffreBlumpkins,2012-09-26T10:55Z,"@area051 you're a retard.

@karkid Are you burning this with A Ihas drive? I just ordered one from Ebay. IHAS324B for $30 and Bought 50 Verbatim disk for $15 as well. "
,SeNoRxSmOkEy,2012-09-26T11:02Z,@karkid so your saying you made 6 copies how about you seed asshole
[T],thenoobish,2012-09-26T11:32Z,It's out on other trackers and this looks real.
,pcdaley21,2012-09-26T19:26Z,"Its 100% working, some improvements over Fifa12.  Looking for English NTSC ProEvo13 if anyone has it."
,DanQuiros,2012-09-26T20:46Z,seeeeed people. don't be greedy. because of those not seeding is why the community is dying. everyone just want and want without giving anything. F*ck You
,Oreynoso1,2012-09-26T21:25Z,How are you guys playing the game on-line if the game isn't verified through abgx? or did you guys do the topology inject? I just want to play it safe to not get banned. any ideas?
,Oreynoso1,2012-09-26T21:31Z,Where is the patch for this game? abgx hasn't verified it yet?
,siwel00,2012-09-26T23:54Z,Please do not download this Im burning with Ihas burner and I just wasted a verbatim on this torrent. So people dont waste your time. 
,pcdaley21,2012-09-27T01:10Z,Update to my last posting - I've played half dozen quick matches with no problem but when tried career mode I get disk read error :o(
,GTBDarkchamp56,2012-09-27T01:48Z,pcdaley21 Yeah i'm having the same problem
,db2000zxc,2012-09-27T02:05Z,is it ok to update from the disc?
,db2000zxc,2012-09-27T02:11Z,can i update the system from the fifa disc as required to play the game?
,alfzone,2012-09-27T04:14Z,"Same problem, made 3 copies, and froze after a game"
,alfzone,2012-09-27T04:15Z,get disk read error 
,pcdaley21,2012-09-27T04:21Z,Yes you can update from disk. I've heard if you install a retail copy to the hdd (rent/borrow) then you can play the backup version with no errors. I've yet to try it.
,DeadLockBR,2012-09-27T13:12Z,This does not work. Do not download.
,Smallz94,2012-09-28T01:10Z,WTF i was so happy after i finish downloading it and when i went to career mode  ERROR!! WOW WTF!! uploader! 
,Smallz94,2012-09-28T01:43Z,i guess career mode doesnt work. I need this game to be verify so i can play xbox live.  thats the only way to play this game and play kick off mode.. 
,Smallz94,2012-09-29T00:53Z,abgx360 still didnt verify fifa13
