I. Description:
-----------------
The sequel to 2007's Game of the Year, Portal 2 is a hilariously 
mind-bending adventure that challenges you to use wits over weaponry in 
a funhouse of diabolical science.

Using a highly experimental portal device, youΓÇÖll once again face off 
against a lethally inventive, power-mad A.I. named GLaDOS. And this time 
you wonΓÇÖt be alone. Meet an expanded cast of characters as you think your 
way through dangerous, never-before-seen areas of Aperture Laboratories.

Break the laws of spatial physics in ways you never thought possible, 
with a wider variety of portal puzzles and an expansive story that spans 
a single player and co-operative game mode.
