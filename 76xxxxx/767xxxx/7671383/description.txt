Hi,
 
I like music that comes close, is honest and clear. Solid tracks that stand their own. This month, I had to look very hard. Fortunately I found some nice and recent Indie music (Pop, Folk, Rock, Chill) which comes close.
 
One important source (thank you all) was late. So it took some time to finish part Two. Part One has been released two weeks agoΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇª Enjoy.
 
Remark:
Somebody said ΓÇ£These are the best Indie Playlists aroundΓÇ¥, and I felt some resistance to call it best. But when I think about it; if you select all the ΓÇ£bestΓÇ¥ tracks from all other playlists (plus), then you probably end up with something like the ΓÇ£bestΓÇ¥ of all Indie Playlists......... I would like to think that.
