Nature: What Females Want and Males Will Do
In nature's mating game, it's a jungle out there! In this fun and fascinating two-part Nature miniseries, you'll be surprised at what animals will do for love! This fun and fascinating look at courtship in the animal kingdom reveals amazing new discoveries that give new meaning to the words "animal attraction." In part one, "What Females Want," the answers to the age-old question, "What do women want?" just might be found in the animal kingdom. Scientists using unorthodox techniques and the latest technology are probing the mysteries of attraction. What makes a male gelada baboon a good catch? Do "clothes" make the barn swallow? What can a "fembot" tell us about the sage grouse's ritual mating behaviour? Discover how females are shaping the future of their species by choosing the best mates. In part two, learn "What Males Will Do" to win his mate. He will make music, fight, overdress, change body colours, develop astonishing anatomy, illuminate, even agree to be eaten alive...all in the name of love! From dancing spiders and drumming monkeys to a bird impressionist, discover what males will do to show they have what it takes! Narrated by Academy Award-winner F. Murray Abraham.



2)  Males Will Do 
Apparently, there is nothing a male will not do for the right to mate with a female - dance, sing, fight, change body colours, illuminate, even agree to be eaten alive. There is often a surplus of males, and they are instinctively driven to compete in order to pass their genes to the next generation. But it takes two to tango. Now, scientists are learning to what extremes males will go in order to find that dance partner.
