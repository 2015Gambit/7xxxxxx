A refreshingly Christian look at the history of how and why America was founded. Our study reaffirms that America's cultural national heritage was solidly based upon Christian principles and Biblical doctrine. This study begins in 1580, with Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Francis Bacon, and continues to our Founding Fathers.
