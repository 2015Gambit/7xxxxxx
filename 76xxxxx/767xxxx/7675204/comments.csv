Thanks mdusanjay!!!!"

Ah....what do you mean finishing ?  No more spiderman ?"

The way Dan Slott has come across with his statement that he will have to go into hiding for fear of death threats from Spider fans, after #700 hits the shelves, suggests that maybe he won't be writing Spider-Man after that.

Avenging may turn into his premier title or they may launch a new title. I haven't seen the solicits or previews for a new Spidey title launch yet however."
