,kakuichi1,2012-09-27T17:54Z,"Do you remember the name of a series that has the same concept as America's Got Powers, but it's about a girl that wins the same type of tournament but she brings about the destruction of the world.  It's from some comic company that seems to only do comics w/ female heroines I believe?  I can't remember the name of the company or the comic!  Thank You!"

,giggidyp,2012-09-29T02:47Z,all of your other dls work fine so why change now???
[T],mdusanjay,2012-09-29T04:51Z,lot of people complain that its broken..thats why i commented to use cdisplayex..if its fine just ignor it..and happy reading
,Joecooler2u,2012-09-29T06:13Z,I use cdisplayex and still get that broken archive error. Re-downloaded a few times and still have the same problem.
,Joecooler2u,2012-09-29T09:02Z,Something must have gotten messed up in the original compression. I went to check the individual files and nothing was messed up so I made a new RAR file and it works perfect now. Weird.
,keviner,2012-09-29T18:03Z,"I have dl several mdusanjay comic torrents with the Broken Archive complaint. I have had NO problems and they have scanned Virus Free. Most likely it is an end user problem (which they easily fixed) so ignore them.
Huge props to the uploader! Thanks for all the great scans!!!
(winrar sux, comicrack sux. Pffffffftttttt!)"
,Inter69,2012-09-30T02:10Z,">> keviner 
making comments such as ""winrar sux"" and sticking your head in the sand does not make the problem go away. Its a valid problem and users have commented so the uploader can address the issue."
,sven_svengali2,2012-09-30T15:09Z,"@keviner
Thank you for your most well rehearsed comment in the debate.
As you have read in the comments ,""as the devil reads the bible"" ( ancient proverb  ) I simply remarked there was a problem reading the *.cbr
in question and that winrar referred to ""broken archive"". I used winrar as a reference !
When asked to use cdiplayex instead I answered
 ""am using cdisplay"".
upgraded to *ex and met the same problem.
As for ""7-zip rules"", please do your homework and read what the fuck cdisplayex uses as a base!!!!Â˝! = 7-zip!
stupid cunt.


@mdusanjay

meant no ill will or bad stuff in your direction since IÂ´m most grateful for the stuff you provide.
Works of quality and hard work.
Thank you"
