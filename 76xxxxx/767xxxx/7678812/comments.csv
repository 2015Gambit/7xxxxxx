Ok, i will help you. First start with a port-Check. http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/  Write in the actual port from your torrent programm and check it.

If the port is closed and you're behind a router check the port forwarding http://portforward.com/routers.htm

If this is ok, back to step 1. and check again. 

Stop and Restart the torrent, so the trackers are loading the hashtable again. If you see my IP 95.91.66.149 (superkabel.de), then is all ok. Just wait a little bit, sometimes it needs more time to update.

Sorry for the sarcasm in the first comment. Usually i'm not an Asshole. =)"
