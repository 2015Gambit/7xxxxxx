'Elfquest Gatherum' 

WaRP Graphics, 1988

The 'Gatherum' is a 'behind the scenes' archival collection of Elfquest ephemera.

This it the second edition (or tenth anniversary edition, 1978-1988) of the original Elfquest Gatherum. The is NOT 'The Big Elfquest Gatherum'. I never purchased that one and I've never seen a scan of of it anywhere. But since I've never seen a scan of this one, either, I went ahead and scanned it myself. 


'Epic Covers'

When Epic reprinted the original series Wendy Pini had to create 32 new covers. This is those covers, minus issue 28 - I'm missing that one, plus the original b&w art for each cover up to issue 14.
