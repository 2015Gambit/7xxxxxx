I. Description:
-----------------
Black Mesa (formerly Black Mesa: Source) is a Half-Life 2 total 
conversion remaking of Valve Software's award-winning PC game, 
Half-Life.

Utilizing the Source engine, Black Mesa will reintroduce the player 
as Doctor Gordon Freeman, along with the original cast of memorable 
characters and environments seen in Half-Life. Black Mesa was built 
and founded on the basis that Half-Life: Source didn't fully live up 
to the potential of a Source engine port of Half-Life. As such, Black 
Mesa was founded to fully reconstruct the Half-Life universe utilizing 
Source to its fullest potential in terms of art detail, level sizes 
and code features. It should be noted that the project is being built 
from the ground up and is not a simple port of Half Life maps and 
models into the Source Engine. The idea is to remake the storyline 
used in Half Life into a new polished Source Engine version with new 
models, maps, soundtrack, voice acting and textures.
