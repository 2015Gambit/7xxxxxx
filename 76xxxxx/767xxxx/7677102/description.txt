Hi folks;

The recent Warfield shows were such a compelling experience for me that
I?d like to share them with you. To that end, we?re releasing the
soundboards of all three shows for free download with the invaluable help of
our friends at philzone.com and all the mirror sites.

Get a costume ready (I have mine) for the festivities at our upcoming
Mardi Gras show on February 12, 2005.

Happy New Year!

- Phil
