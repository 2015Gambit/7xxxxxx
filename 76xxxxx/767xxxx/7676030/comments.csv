All of 73 minutes drenched in live sound & vision of SATB in their absolute live prime time. Shee & the He's just out on The Juju Tour, one of the greatest tours of all time. OMMFG (Oh My MotherFuckin Goddess!) Britain's first lady of punk, the godmother of goth, a female firework... Her Regal Zone owns me. This woman in this show, is one of Britain's finest hours in Germany. "
