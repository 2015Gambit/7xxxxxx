Per wiki, Rockpalast (Rock Palace) is a German music television show that broadcasts live on German television station Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR). Rockpalast started in 1974 and continues to this day. Hundreds of rock and jazz bands have performed on Rockpalast. Some acts were recorded for broadcast throughout Europe.

Note: UB40 performed on the same bill, and with SATB apparently opening. Siouxsie razzes the audience about the pop coming up.
