,Toperharrier,2012-09-28T01:43Z,"It seems people in America like racist propaganda told by a negationist whore with some $$$. Good job with the directed doc, it clearly reflects what ur mind on different people is.

So sad America was made of inmigrants who got to the new continent in sight of a better future, and now they just pretend to deny others the same thing.


Tell me another tale M. Lynch, but a better one."
