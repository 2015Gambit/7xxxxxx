Because ^^nosTEAM^^ are not crackers, they are just repackers. And since  nobody cracked version 1.02 yet, obviously ^^nosTEAM^^ are being lying bitches again. Don't download."
,radurall,2012-09-26T19:35Z,"@ dahaka47  
- never ^^nosTEAM^^ has take credits for crack 
- never write ""we are crackers""  
- this is version 1.0.2  "

LMAO, do you see what you are saying? You're practically saying ""there is no crack for version 1.02, but this is 1.02"".

HOW is it 1.02 if no one cracked it? Space hamster magic?"
