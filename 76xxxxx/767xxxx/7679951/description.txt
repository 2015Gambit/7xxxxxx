Everything that you live today is traceable right back to the Oval Office, right back to the White House. Every bit of this is Barack Obama. He's out there... People here on the other side of the glass are nervous that I called him a serial liar. Okay, forget that. Not serial liar. We'll go with "delusional." Does that make you feel better? He's delusional. Obama says he created 4.5 million jobs. Now, to arrive at that figure, 4.5 million jobs... It's absurd! The math doesn't work out.
