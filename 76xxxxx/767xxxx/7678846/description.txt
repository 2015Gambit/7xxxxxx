As promised... Here is the complete Gord the Rogue series by Gary Gygax.  The first two books are also the first two books in the Greyhawk Adventure series.  Due to Gary quitting TSR after the second book was released and his retaining the rights to the characters he completed this series separately from Greyhawk.  For those interested in Greyhawk Adventure Novels as well, I have a post with those books as well.  And if you like my posts or would like to request a author's or series collection please leave a comment.
