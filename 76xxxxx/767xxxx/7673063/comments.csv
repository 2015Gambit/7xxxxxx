,morhirwen,2012-09-28T01:32Z,Does this have the director's commentary? Thanks for the upload.
,gotholympians,2012-09-28T02:47Z,"Aw, but I like commenting. And there's no way I'm downloading this crap. A 1-1 rip? That's even dumber than I thought it was. "
,justregisterme,2012-09-28T07:37Z,"Warning, spoiler!

I just tried to play this and it ended just after the
engine was blown out on the aircraft carrier.
Quality looks excellent until then.

Tried using three vid players including VLC.
Running WindowsXP, NTFS

Is this incomplete or am I doing something wrong?"
[T],jimevjr,2012-09-29T02:09Z,IT MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG AS  ITS IS  COMPLETE  
,emptymuse,2012-09-29T05:28Z,I had the same problem as justregisterme had. Got to the scene where the engine blows out and the movie ended. A little less than 2 hours of the 2.5+ hour movie. Such a waste of my time to download.
