Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection 

Combining three top-selling titles, Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection includes the original Zoo Tycoon game and the Dinosaur Digs and Marine Mania expansion packs, allowing players imaginations to run wild as they care for more than 100 land, aquatic and prehistoric animals in the most beautiful and lively zoo imaginable. Additionally, Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection comes with loads of bonus content, including the entire new Endangered Species Theme Pack. This bonus theme pack features 12 animals on the endangered and/or threatened species list, such as orangutans, whale sharks and Komodo dragons. Zookeepers can tend to these rare animals using more than 40 new objects based on four new themes, and can challenge their inner zoo keeping skills with three new scenarios.
