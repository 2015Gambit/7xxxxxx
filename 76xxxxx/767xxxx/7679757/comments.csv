,NinpoLore,2012-09-30T22:50Z,"I won't download this since I'm a bigger fan of your Marvel uploads, BUT, this occasion is too great to ignore. You've done an amazing job of providing quality comics to passionate fans - as someone pointed out in poignant comment on another torrent, the Piratebay comic community is an absolute mecca of positive vibes and great uploads. We don't argue or debate or flame like the fans over on the music/movie/book pages - we live for comics and it's thanks to your hard work that this community continues to grow.

Truthfully, I think it's because of your efforts that I fell back into comics again at all. I was a huge fan as a kid, but as my teenage years waxed I slowly fell out of love. Credit the ridiculous ""X-TREME!"" story arcs of the 90's. It wasn't until I was an adult that I discovered digital comics on TPB, and that first download absolutely hooked me. 

Not only are you keeping us fanboys (and girls) happy, I firmly believe you're helping to keep the art-form thriving. I buy more comics because of what you upload than I ever did before. So thanks again, mirrormaster - you're an effin' hero, dude!"
