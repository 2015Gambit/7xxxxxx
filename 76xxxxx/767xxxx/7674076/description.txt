'The Pink Floyd Super All-Action Official Tour Programme For Girls And Boys'

AKA the 1975 Pink Floyd Tour Comic Book

Written and Illustrated by Mipgnosis and Nick Mason, Gerald Scarfe, Paul Stubbs, Joe Patagno, Colin Elgie, Richard Evans, Dave Gale

This is a comic book, but the inside front page has a list of everyone associated with the production and performance of the tour. I've always assumed that this was actually sold at the shows, which is pretty cool (yeah, I could probably do some searching and figure it out, but it's almost one in the morning and this is my last upload, so no searching for me!) Cover price was twenty-five cents.
