I am not sure I have the time or energy to write a tutorial on torrenting. There are already
lots of them. And mine would probably not be any better than existing ones.

Read the tutorial at thebox.bz about how you seed a series when they ""repack"" the files from
torrents for individual episodes into a torrent for the full series (and eventually remove the
individual torrents). The process you use is the same as there. You queue/start the new torrent
for seeding rather downloading, by pointing it at a folder that already has the files. Now
however the files come from the public torrent, not the individual episode torrents.

As they say in their tutorial, back up the files first just in case they get trashed!

Besides this torrent, these public torrents posted by me came from torrents on thebox.bz:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7214563/Heartbeat_-_Series_4
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7224923/Heartbeat_Series_5
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7356639/Heartbeat_-_Series_6_(1996)__[TVRip_(XVID)]
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7395655/Heartbeat_-_Series_7_(1997-1998)__[TVRip_(XVID)]
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7668885/Heartbeat_-_Series_8_(1998-1999)__[TVRip_(XVID)]

The name of the torrent appears in the notes.

These public torrents not posted by me also contain all of the files (same file and
folder name too) as torrents on thebox.bz as follows:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6768109/Heartbeat_-_Series_1
  is Heartbeat - Series 1 (1992) [DVDRip (Xvid)] on thebox.bz
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6769180/Heartbeat_-_Series_2
  is Heartbeat - Series 2 (1993) [DVDRip(XviD)] on thebox.bz
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6798085/Heartbeat___(Season_3_-_Complete)
  is Heartbeat - Series 3 (1993) [DVDRip(XviD)] on thebox.bz"
