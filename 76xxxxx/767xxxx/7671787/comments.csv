,GeekyGamer01,2012-10-01T00:21Z,"@SeraphimPerezz: Never seen that error before, if your in an emulator you might want to use 'save state', or change your Flash type (in the tools/options menu)

@Rengade: Download 'DeSmuME' (google), open it, click File > Open then browse to the download folder of the games and open."
,Djghost13,2012-10-04T03:27Z,I was actually surprised to see this working. I currently only started white 2 and in the wifi menu its all in japanese but the game appears to be in english (you have a choice of choosing english or jap when you start a new game) so thanks for it.
,Djghost13,2012-10-04T03:30Z,Its actually only partially in english since theres still plenty of japanese writing ingame.
