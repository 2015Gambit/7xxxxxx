,kingda74,2012-09-30T01:57Z,"This is not Grease or even close..  It's just fucking stupid..  This film, simply put, is gayer than 5 guys humping 6 guys :|

Tom Cruise just needs to retire, and why is he playing a rock star and he's like 60?? Hold on, OK I just checked wiki and it says Tom Cruise is 1000 Years old :)

If my comment didn't make you laugh, you are an ass-facer"
