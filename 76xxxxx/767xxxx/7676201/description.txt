Mrs Biggs is a 2012 television series written by Jeff Pope based on the true story
of the woman behind Britains most famous villain, Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs
and journey from na√Øve young woman at the hands of an overbearing father to the joy
of freedom and motherhood as a gangsters moll.

Finally, in this run-of-the-mill biopic, we reach the episode in Ronnie Biggss life

But as Biggs(Daniel Mays) becomes Britains most wanted man, she is put under close

He isnt the Ronnie she once knew; he has undergone botched plastic surgery in an
attempt to change his appearance. Still, he has a cunning plan, they should all move
to Australia.
