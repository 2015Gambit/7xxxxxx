[V],twentyforty,2012-09-26T07:16Z,"WEB-DL, clean, no station logo, no glitches from airing.  AV is BluRay-like.
Unfortunately, WEB-DL comes to iTunes usually next or two days after actual airing and tend to be left out of the scope of guys who made subtitles.

So - pro&contra... It depends, in short."
