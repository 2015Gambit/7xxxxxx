'PS Preventive Maintenance Monthly' 

Issue No. 104, 1961 Series

Published by the Department of the Army for the information of organizational maintenance and supply personnel. 

Written and Illustrated (I believe) by Will Eisner (I know he did the cover and created the characters, just not sure he illustrated it cover to cover, but I THINK he did.)

There is supposedly MANY of these out there with contributions from a lot of masterful hands, but this is the only one I have right now.
