I'm no noob at any of this, been at the scene since net came out, but this one has got me stumped.  Lot's of clicking noises in the audio throughout the whole movie and I've tried every media player out there and tried various tweaks.  Could you check out the rip for yourself and let us know?  Thanks again YIFY, you truly are the #1 movie ripper!  Sorry Axxo, but YIFY just has that certain something. ;)"
