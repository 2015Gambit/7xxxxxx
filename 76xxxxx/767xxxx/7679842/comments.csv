,vatel88,2012-09-28T16:02Z,FYI this show airs on Travel channel not SYfy.
,vatel88,2012-09-28T18:12Z,"Also this episode aired on 9-19-12 not on 9-26-12.

On 9-26-12 the episode is the 7th in the season and called ""its chiller time"" 

Nice try on the up, next time some research and attention to correct titling would help. These are essential for earning a Skull on the site. Just trying to help. "
,vatel88,2012-09-28T18:30Z,"Lmao @Royboy you deleted my post informing you that this episode was not aired on 9-26-12. You shouldn't be embarassed or upset that you labeled something wrong. As i said in my message you deleted if you correctly title things and put the time into researching it you will earn that Skull i know you want. 

@ those looking for correct info- This episode was aired on 9-19-12. Most recent episode was aired on 9-26-12 was titled ""it's chilled time"" and was the 7th episode in the first season. "
,vatel88,2012-09-28T18:31Z,"never mind on the deleted post issue, apparently TPB is having posting issues on the comments as it appears and disappears with refreshing. My apologies for double posting the info."
