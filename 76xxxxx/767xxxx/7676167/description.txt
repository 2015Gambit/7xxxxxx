All of the thoughts we waste
Under weight of the world
All of the time we spend
Under weight of the world

Don't waste your ways
Don't miss living
Long live my pain
Long live this feeling

Blind and childish
I won't fight it
Here I hide
Underneath my innocence
Grow. Grow.

Blind and childish
I won't fight it
Here I hide
Underneath my innocence
Grow. Grow.

All of the lies we bent
Under weight of the world
Caught, beaten by the edge
Of the weight of the world

Long live this pain
Long live this feeling
I Don't need to change
Need to believe in

Blind and childish
I won't fight it
Here I hide
Underneath my innocence
Grow. Grow.

Blind and childish
I won't fight it
Here I hide
Underneath my innocence
Grow. Grow.

Here I hide (Here I hide)
Here I hide (Here I hide)
Here I hide (Here I hide)
Here I hide (Here I hide)

Blind and childish
I won't fight it
Here I hide
Underneath my innocence
Grow. Grow.

Blind and childish
I won't fight it
Here I hide
Underneath my innocence
Grow. Grow.
