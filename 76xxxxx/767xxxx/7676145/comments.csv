Thanks."
[T],MrDowntown,2012-09-27T00:37Z,"I would have to say Robert Kirkman is the best comic writer out there.

Yes there's Bendis, Snyder, Johns ...

But Kirkman has two of the absolute best series that he has consistently written amazingly to 100 issues on top of ALL the other things he writes."
