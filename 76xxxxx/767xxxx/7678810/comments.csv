I could go higher with the audio, but then i'd be thinking, ""I wish I could go 1.5mbps DTS!""  And even if iTunes were capable of that, I'd think ""Why not DTS Master Audio?""  Anyway, I used to use 640k.. then I dropped down to 448 (since some older stereos can't handle > 448).  Then I realized that most of my DVDs used to be 384k, and I never complained about the audio then.  And since the whole point (to me, anyway) of this AppleTV is convenience, I decided to start keeping the file size down as much as possible.  If I REALLY want the best picture and sound, I'll pop in a Blu-ray.  That's why I shifted from using RF=20 on the video and just doing a targeted file size based on iTunes store sizes (using a 2-pass Average Bit Rate).  I guess I'm just trying to keep the quality somewhere in the neighborhood of the iTunes store.  Convenience vs. Quality.  Convenience wins out for me.  

Plus, I currently have a very cheap surround sound system, so it wouldn't make much difference to me right now on the sound anyway.  :P"
