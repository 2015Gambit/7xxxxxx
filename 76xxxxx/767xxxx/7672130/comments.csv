,ScarletteSpider,2012-09-28T21:35Z,"thnx for the great quality uploads of UltSprmn OJ, but do us a favor plz? Stop cutting off the alert files on the ending credits? Tired of hearing my kids whine and cry that they don't get to see them. Their classmates are spouting factoids from these and it's making my kids look stupid because they aren't getting access to the same info that other kids with rich parents that can afford cable get access to. Single mom, single income, get torrents first to see what we watch over and over again before I buy. Anything that gets watched once I delete. So stop jipping my kids huh? plz?"
