Prager 20120926     3 Angrier at Relatives: Liberals or Conservatives?

Prager H3: At family get-togethers, who gets angrier ΓÇô liberal relatives at conservative ones or 
 conservative relatives at liberal ones? All callers said it was their liberal relatives who more likely 
 to express anger. Dennis acknowledged that since most of his audience leans conservative,
 this was not a scientific poll. Nevertheless, it is his opinion that the liberal relative is more likely
 to express anger at the conservative relative rather than vice versa. A Best of Prager Hour.
