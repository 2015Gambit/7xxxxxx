,Mega_troll,2012-09-28T00:53Z,"OBAMA: Lets turn America into a third world Kenya!

FOLLOWERS: Yeaaaaaah!"
,billy_the_poop,2012-09-28T01:14Z,"It boggles the mind how many Americans got caught by this soundbite.

For those still in blissful ignorance:
""You didn't build that"" referred to stuff built by the government: roads, schools, the invention of the internet, etc. It did NOT refer to businesses. 

It is very clear, once you hear what Obama said right before the quoted fragment. He didn't formulate his thought in the clearest way and people are making a use of that. Fox News and other propaganda outlets leave that out on purpose and feed disinformation to its retarded lemming audience.

(I mean, how stupid one needs to be to watch Fox News or NBC.)"
,dumbson,2012-09-28T03:28Z,nice to see mega troll living up to his small penised name
,Mega_troll,2012-09-28T03:48Z,"@dumbson

SORRY TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS!
sound like one of his FOLLOWER :-)"
,GourmetPrince,2012-09-28T04:02Z,It's pathetic. Obama sucks for so many great reasons and THIS is the one you choose... Guess even the stupid know how to hate.
,wonderwang,2012-09-28T04:09Z,"You had to be simple minded to get fooled by him the first time since everything about his was such a secret.....you have to be a brain damaged idiot to ignore the mess of the last 3 years and 9 months to vote for this fraud, liar and cheat a second time."

,LemonJ-Lo,2012-09-28T16:18Z,"And so we should all vote instead for a multimillionaire who hides his wealth offshore and who thinks that 47% of Americans are greedy leeches sucking at the government tit?  And whose Vice Presidential choice thinks we should turn Social Security over to the same bankers who helped us out so much when we all were buying houses, and should turn Medicare over to the same insurance agencies who have been happily raising our rates by 15% every year?

Sounds like a great deal to me.  What I can't understand is how you anti-Obama haters think that the Republican party is your friend and has your interest at heart.  (Unless you are also multimillionaires, in which case it makes perfect sense)."
,Retrenched,2012-09-28T16:19Z,"Lots of mindless TeaTardisms here to be sure.

Rmoney's now going down in flames, hard and fast - as any self-entitled loser should.  I can smell Sheldon Adelson's $70 million burning from my porch.  Hee hee!  Chortle..."
