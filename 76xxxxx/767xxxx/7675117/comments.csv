does it have subs?"
,DreaD151,2012-09-27T17:54Z,first off MKV and mp4 are not new they have been around for years especially mp4 and it has to do with quality when you compress video and decode it from devices such as camcorder format or  cellphone or even dvd format it goes into the most basic of resolution and quality it might look good if you you record something with a $50000 camera in a theatre it would look really good hahah but most of the time its not even a name brand camera its a korean or chinese camera with a generic name stamped on it and those might say 14 mp but be a 800x600 resolution so when people up the quality they have to do it in a format that wont be shitty or make the file like 10gb
