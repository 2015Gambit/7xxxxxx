,azidtrip,2012-09-26T02:48Z,"NetBlaise 

You can use various decompressors like winrar, winace etc to open this. But thesse cost money. I recommend you use 7-zip. Its free and one of the best out there. :) www.7-zip.org www.winace.com www.rarlab.com"

,Snake2012,2012-09-26T06:41Z,The only add on it finds is the Zygorviewer how do i get it to see the Talent Advisor? When I extract it it only has one file... I noticed within that file it has the Talent Advisor file in it. Tried to cut and past that out into the addon folder. But was no use. Please help. Thanks
