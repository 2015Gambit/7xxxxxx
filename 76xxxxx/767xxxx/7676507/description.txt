[ENJOY AND SEED - YahSoft]

Lyrics:

Here you go way too fast
Don't slow down you're gonna crash
You should watch - watch your stay here
Don't look out you're gonna break your neck

So shut, shut your mouth
Cos I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
Enough to last a life time through
So what - what do you want of me?
Got no words of sympathy and if i go around with you
You know that i'll get messed up too with you

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na

Here you go way too fast
Don't slow down you're gonna crash
You don't know what's been going down
You've been running all over town

So shut, shut your mouth
Cos i'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
Enough to last a life time through
So what - what do you want of me?
Got no cure for misery and if I go around with you
You know that i'll get messed up too with you, with
you, with you, with you....

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na

You, with you, with you
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Don't slow down you're gonna crash
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Don't Slow down you're gonna crash
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Don't slow down you're gonna crash...
