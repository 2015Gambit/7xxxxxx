you may think that He  ""produced religion of hate and terror"" but with 1500 million flower ? there must be some thing more then hate about it .
any way its not bad to know about people ways of life ..we all read about Hitler do we admire him?     "
,raenkae,2012-09-26T17:40Z,"sotile: Yes! He produced a religion of hate and terror! You cannot use the amount of followers as an measurement of ""accuracy"" of an religion. Then as christianity have the largest group of followers at 2 billion, is the only religion that are right, and as christianity deny the prophethood of muhammad, islam is wrong.

But now we dont measure anything as this ludicrous. The Fact is really that islam was spread by an combination of threats, persuasion, terror, persecutions and so on. We as humans are very easy to adjust ourselves to an group. The larger the group, the easier for us to DELUDE ourselves that the group is the bearer of ""truth"". And if the religion have mechanism in it that condemn impulses from outside, the group is ENFORCED in their delusion!

This is a religion which is centered around just ONE man and his claim to talk to the hebrew achangel Gabriel/Jibreel.

It is THERE you need to be critical! Not in the amount of followers! Humans can really be an dumb animal in our needs to follow others!"
