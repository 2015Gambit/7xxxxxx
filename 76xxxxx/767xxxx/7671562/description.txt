A secret software created by the American government leaks into Mumbai, India and is at risk to going completely underground. An American spy is sent into India to recover the software.

It is a spoof of Casino Royale but with a Indian Twist to it.
It is a fun movie to watch on a lazy day when you have ran out ofAlso for anyone who is interested in filmmaking, this movie is a perfect example of how a low budget movie can be made of superior technical and digital(post-production) quality.

Thanks and please seed.
