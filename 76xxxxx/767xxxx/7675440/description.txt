Directed by long-time visual collaborator Lasse Hoile, Get All You Deserve was filmed in Mexico City during the recent Grace For Drowning Tour. The set captures the spectacular live experience that Steven Wilson and Hoile created for the tour on Blu-ray, DVD and 2CD. Following the release of Grace For Drowning, Steven embarked on his first ever solo tour, assembling a virtuoso band, featuring Marco Minnemann (drums), Nick Beggs (bass), Theo Travis (flute and sax), Adam Holzman (keys) and Niko Tsonev (guitars), to accompany him. For the shows he worked extensively with Lasse to create a show unlike anything else he had attempted with his other bands, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No-Man or Bass Communion. Get All You Deserve captures one of the key shows from the tour. Recorded at a sold-out Teatro Metropolitan in Mexico City, the gig features tracks from both Wilson’s solo albums along with the new, as yet unreleased, track Luminol.
Steven Wilson (born Steven John Wilson on November 3, 1967, in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England) is a self-taught guitarist, producer, audio engineer, bass guitar and keyboard player (among other musical instruments). He is perhaps best known as the lead guitarist/singer and songwriter for progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, but his projects are numerous, including collaborations with Israeli superstar Aviv Geffen, Blackfield, long-running partnership with Tim Bowness, No-Man, and teaming up with Dirk Serries , Continuum, as well as his own solo projects Bass Communion and Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, and the albums Insurgentes and Grace for Drowning under his own name. In addition to his prolific musical output, he has also undertaken production work with such high-profile artists as Opeth, Dream Theater, Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, Anathema, Orphaned Land, Marillion, Fish, Yoko Ono, and friend Robert Fripp. He is also part way through remixing the back catalogue of King Crimson into surround sound and new stereo mixes.
Currently, he is planning to record a collaborative album with Opeth’s singer, guitarist and composer Mikael Åkerfeldt, called Storm Corrosion. Wilson, also known for the high production quality of his music, employs synthesizers and programmed music along with live instruments to create a unique atmosphere for each song he works on, including otherwise-simple pop tunes.
