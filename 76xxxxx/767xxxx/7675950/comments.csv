,Olathural,2012-09-26T21:55Z,So now i should be able to play online right? xD
,tapp3r,2012-09-27T00:04Z,Kinda useless update unfortunately. They're not fixing anything important.
,dallaskhl,2012-09-27T06:45Z,I install this update but when i click play at the launcher the launcher disappears and nothing happened. anyone having this problem too? pls help
,likeitis69,2012-09-27T06:45Z,"Excellent!

HERE IS HOW I FIXED THE DX9  ""CRASH AFTER A FEW MINUTES"" UNREAL ENGINE BUG

(D3DERR_DRIVERINTERNALERROR, video stops, sound continues)

,OmniNegro,2012-09-27T10:12Z,"How many updates before they do anything worthwhile or actually fix something?

The sole reason they do these is to make it harder for pirates to play multiplayer."
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-27T10:29Z,"What are the problems that they arent fixing? i've never found a problem in the game. Just relax and let them do their job.

@OmniNegro
Doubt that's their main concern...."
,OmniNegro,2012-09-27T11:59Z,"@alexisthebest

As you said, there are no real bugs at current.

I installed the first patch without reason. No harm done. But what is the point? I think I will wait until there is a patch that fixes issues I care about. These first two just make it slightly more difficult to cheat."
,.human,2012-09-27T12:58Z,I'm not installing any patch unless it enables head popping headshots.
,br1ng1t0nh0,2012-09-27T16:38Z,"fake

tried both layer breaks
do not waste your bandwidth and dual layer discs and your time does not work"
,autumn15,2012-09-27T19:13Z,do i need to install update one before this or no?
,spikeabercrombie,2012-09-27T19:46Z,anyone know when 1.0.3 (Update 3) will be cracked??
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-09-28T18:58Z,Soon
,cconway82,2012-09-28T22:47Z,Hey whats the jig on 1.0.3? you almost done with it? cant wait!
,cconway82,2012-09-28T22:50Z,Hey how close are you to releasing 1.0.3? today maybe? :D
,spikeabercrombie,2012-09-28T23:21Z,thanks for the reply Gh0st! just wanting to play with my legit steam friends lol
,sixor,2012-09-29T15:04Z,"does not work on windows 8-64

but i trust the torrent, just win8 fucking"
,OmniNegro,2012-09-29T15:38Z,"@idiot
This is not a DVD Image in case you did not notice. Be sure you post your comments on the correct torrent or you look like a total idiot.

I am sure there are many fake DVD images posted here. But layer breaks are something that s not going to be restricted to just two possibilities except in the most extreme situations. 

Use ImgBurn and set it yourself. A bad burn does not always mean the image is the problem. Besides, you should just backup the image itself and mount it when you need it."
,MrTTAO,2012-09-29T16:47Z,"There is a concerning amount of downvotes on this torrent but why?

The best I can see from the comments is the complaint that update fixes very very little (and no, its not because there are ""no bugs"")."
,SolarPWR,2012-09-29T16:59Z,"@br1ng1t0nh0
it works.. u just need to have Steam app installed (doesn't need to be running), and for your info you never need to burn images to real discs, just mount them with double-click with app like WinCDEmu."
,spikeabercrombie,2012-09-30T00:24Z,is update 3 harder to crack or have extra protections or something? have a feeling update 4 might release on steam before someone uploads update 3
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-30T03:12Z,"@spikeabercrombie
The newest update doesnt have much, they might just not think it's that important.

Also, if you plan on playing with friends who have real copies, they should ALWAYS disable auto update. If you dont, you'll just keep running into the same problem of being behind.

you could just make them install this patch and copy their player data over, but probably not worth it."
,spikeabercrombie,2012-09-30T03:22Z,"@alexisthebest
yeah it wasn't a major update, just was hoping someone would upload it lol"
,Olathural,2012-09-30T10:45Z,doesnt start the game... flashes the ballon with the 4 characters and then closes.. any way around this?
,willybillydoe11,2012-09-30T14:50Z,shelling out a little extra cash is something better then the headache of getting these games to work =P
,Performer81,2012-09-30T14:58Z,"paste 3dm crack over it.
run skidrow update 2 setup. Paste the skidrow files in bin 32 folder. run launcher.exe"
,spikeabercrombie,2012-09-30T18:49Z,"@Applesauce,
yeah my friends aren't very computer savvy and they paid $60 for a game, doubt they want to crack their legit version to play with one pirate friend lol oh well lets just wait and be patient, maybe update 4 will be uploaded after it releases =P"
,TaZeRz,2012-10-01T02:26Z,"Anyone get this to work with Windows 8, except for version 1.0 with the Windows 8 specific crack?  I wanna play the latest update on Windows 8, who uses that old Windows 7 junk os anyway?"
[V],alexisthebest,2012-10-01T03:20Z,"@spikeabercrombie
yea, they might just be waiting for the next update that's actually significant.

@AppleSauceCanadian
In that case, purchase the game. 1. you'll be helping the devs 2. you dont have to worry about being a patch or two behind.

I cant release the 3rd update if it was never made by SKIDROW. They never put out an update so there is nothing to upload."
,s1raz1,2012-10-01T07:42Z,"So update 1 was to kill the key xploits and this one is to kill infinite money xploit.
Plenty of folks  playing base version so far on tunngle.
Thx for upload ill keep it just in case.
So far game works flawless, i havent even found a stuck spot yet, am like 60 or 70% in game no issues."
,User264,2012-10-01T08:29Z,Please - does this work with BlackBox version of the game?
,User264,2012-10-01T14:07Z,"Or, to make it more general, can I use Skidrow updates for installations other than theirs? In this case, BlackBox?"
,MrTTAO,2012-10-03T16:24Z,"Pretty minor update (they still haven't fixed any of the more irking bugs) but an update nonetheless.

Changes:
- Fixed issue with trading negative credit values.
|Never seen this bug... but still, a bug fixed.
- Fixed issue regarding pre-order incentives.
|Using skidrow update 1 I did not have preorder cheat items (DLC). Now I do.
- Fixed issue regarding connectivity problems involving routers with restricted Firewall UDP settings.
|Irrelevant for a cracked copy."
