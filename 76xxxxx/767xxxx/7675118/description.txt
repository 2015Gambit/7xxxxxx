PLOT:

The story centers around two best friends, Kevin (Rosano) and Gina (Reid), who do absolutely everything together.. almost. Unfortunately, despite harboring a major crush on her, Kevin has never been able to move their relationship past the "Friend Zone." So, when Gina suggests that they try their hand at online dating, Kevin's fear of losing her pushes him to do the unthinkable. Stealing the identity of his coworker, Cameron, and creating a fake online profile, he sets out to woo his best friend, Gina. But when she falls for her online suitor and demands that they meet in person, Kevin will have to risk everything by telling the truth. Will his deception destroy their entire relationship, or will they finally step outside the "Friend Zone?"
