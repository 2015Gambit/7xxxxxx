This movie is NOT 16:9.. it's 2.35 : 1 
..and you can clearly see the black bars in the screenshots you provided in the link.
But Thank You again for the up.. been looking for a Super-HQ rip of this for awhile now."

I'll be putting the right Aspect Ratio next time and the next and the next.., won't forget!
Thanks for noticing it and your nice comment. 
You are sooo welcome here. :)"

so when you fullscreen it, you should see the clear difference that i'm talking about this FULFILS the screen NOT like the ""extra software cropping"" feeling that you get with an encoded version of this movie.
Just to make sure there's no mistaken people here."
