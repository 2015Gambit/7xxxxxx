,BoonesFerry,2012-09-26T10:25Z,"@J3rryKo42O, by the way, WRONG!
You might want to check a tv listing guide before commenting ;)

Season 4 is RESUMING after a mid-season break.

Season 5, info: In September 2012 Tosh.0 was officially renewed for a fifth season of 30 episodes. This is due to begin airing in January 2013."
,J3rryKo42O,2012-09-26T15:28Z,"@boonesferry if you actually WATCH the episode he says at the beginning ""all great things must come to an end"" referring to season 4. Try paying some attention instead of making stupid comments. 

@UAofE exactly thank you. "

You two are idots...and apparently you don't mind flaunting it. 

Unlike the two of you, I do research before commenting. 

S04E20 at 16:58 ""Welcome back to the closing ceremonies, this is our last episode of the SUMMER and it could not have come soon enough"" ... ""Keep up with our blog it will constantly be updated during the BREAK"". At 20:50 ""See you in Autumn, jerks"".

S04E21 at 00:35 ""We have returned. Welcome to Tosh.0 it's been exhilarating 57 days without you, but all good things must come to an end (referring to the 57 day mid-season break). This Fall the wardrobe will be overpriced concert Tees"".

There are many shows that take extended mid-season breaks and continue/resume many days, weeks, and sometimes months later.  A ""Season"" is whatever the show's contract says a season is (30 episodes for season 4) and does not necessarily start and stop (coincide) with the four, weather, seasons of the year. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF SEASON FOUR!!!

TVGuide & ZAP2it are the two top authorities in tv show listings and they both list the show as continuing after a mid-season, summer, break...as do every other mainstream authority in the industry...INCLUDING THE TOSH.0 BLOG

So either you two are correct and the rest of the world are wrong, or the two of you need to pull your heads out of your asses and accept that someone else is correct."
,J3rryKo42O,2012-10-04T17:46Z,"so TVguide and ZAP2it are apart of comedy central? thats interesting cause i never hear them mentioned so their information MUST be right. 

why dont you go on daniel tosh's twitter and scroll down until you see ""season 5 premiers tonight assholes""

I mean jeez you did mention a bunch of random websites that zero people use but I'm pretty sure i'll trust the HOST of the damn show in question lol

this is the 5th season and i dont need to post 7 random links to prove it. :) 

ps you mad bro? lololol"
,J3rryKo42O,2012-10-04T17:49Z,btw you clearly didnt need to post 5 of those link mentioning season 5 because this IS season 5. So clearly the show has already been renewed. Thanks for coming out though.
