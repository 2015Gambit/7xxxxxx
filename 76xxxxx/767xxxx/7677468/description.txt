Avengers vs. X-Men (abbreviated AvX) is a limited series comic book crossover event published by Marvel Comics, that involves the return of the Phoenix Force and the subsequent war between the Avengers and the X-Men. The 12 issue bimonthly event first published in April 2012 features a storyline by Jason Aaron, Brian Michael Bendis, Ed Brubaker, Jonathan Hickman and Matt Fraction and a rotating team of artists including John Romita, Jr., Olivier Coipel and Adam Kubert.
The event was preceded by the four-issue limited series, Avengers: X-Sanction by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness, and Avengers vs. X-Men #0. The event also ties into the limited series, AVX: VS, described as "the fight book" which expands upon many of the one-on-one battles featured in the main series, the digital series, Avengers vs. X-Men: Infinite, and into a number of ongoing series, including Avengers, Avengers Academy, New Avengers, Secret Avengers, Uncanny X-Men, Wolverine and the X-Men and X-Men: Legacy. The event will be succeeded by the limited series, AvX: Consequences and A+X, which will feature a team-up of different Avengers and X-Men following the main series.
