Whether you have been a fan of Marvel Comics for 40 minutes or 40 years, chances are you have one or two favorite issues; or one particular story that entertained or inspired you has stuck with you since the day your first read it; or one great issue taught you something about the world we live in, or about the nature of the people who populate it. Over the years, between the astonishingly brilliant covers of countless comics, we have seen acts of unspeakable evil and of unwavering heroism; the very worst and the very best humanity (and super-humanity) has to offer. All of this can be seen on the pages of any Marvel Comic. Marvel's powers-that-be wanted to know which issues resonated most with the Marvel readers. So, they printed and tallied over 50,000 ballots, and in doing so discovered that everybody has their own favorite comic.

This collection is dedicated to anyone who has ever bagged and boarded an issue. If you have ever lent a prized copy to a friend, or ever waited for a comic book store to open to see what was going to happen next in the lives of the heroes, you are cordially invited to download this torrent, which comprises the top 100 Greatest Marvels Of All Time, as voted for by you, the reader.

This torrent contains ALL 100 Marvels, not just some of the reprints.
