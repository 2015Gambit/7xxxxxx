,MagiciansFR,2012-09-28T00:35Z,"I meant ask, not as in the previous note. And, by the way, do you have any good sources you could share for lately published sci-fi/fantasy books and audio books now that Demonoid is down?"
,Xoremus,2012-09-28T01:45Z,"The Robert Conroy book dont come out till Dec. and thats in hardcover...i didnt see anything on amazon about it even being released as an e-book so that might take some time.  The other book i cant find at all, the title and author brings up a 20 page short story by the same name..ill keep looking"
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-28T02:34Z,"The Rising Sun is shown as a new e-book this month, and the Ring of Fire III and When the People Fell are shown as newly published this month on this site:  http://www.baen.com/
