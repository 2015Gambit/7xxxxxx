Version three of the torrent. This is a pretty big update.

Both DVDs have brand new encodes. Hatsutaiken is entirely optional, though; it's 10-bit this time and has proper deinterlacing, but it's nothing major. Sayonara, Gotou-san has a new encode straight from my DVD, 10-bit x264 with FLAC audio. This also includes the music videos from the bonus DVD (all of which are now the proper resolution). There are scans and stuff from both included as well. Note, however, that each DVD is now in its own folder. (There's also a live PV for Yukiko-san. Be sure to check that out.)

There's quality updates for a couple things, namely Shimizu and Swing. I've added as many scans/album pics as I could find, but please excuse the poor quality of some of them.

Mariko now has her own folder. Just move the album into it as is and it should be fine. Nothing was changed there. There are some new live videos and an interview, too. The interview starts right in the middle of Drone, so that's why the video cuts short.

There's not much else I can add anymore, to be honest. Until I can buy the rest of their stuff, I probably won't be updating unless something major comes out. The initial seeding should hopefully be better this time around. I ask that you please, PLEASE seed as long as you can. It would make the process less painful for everyone. This stuff is hard enough to get as it is.

Enjoy.
