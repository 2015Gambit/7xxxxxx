,pangit55,2012-10-01T07:50Z,"I've only listened to a few tracks and skimmed others, but this is excellent stuff!

Retro in spots (the wahwah guitar in 'Devil's Lullaby, for example) with some metal influences, folk and even some trance-y drones here and there.

These kids have a nice vision for their music."
