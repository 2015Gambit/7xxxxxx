,xboXtrme,2012-09-25T18:21Z,"all games works on JTAG! doesn't matter if it is PAL or NTSC and it needs JTAG 'cause it's RIP. ripped games doesn't work on LT firmware

BUT, I bet this torrent is fake"
,Tegra3,2012-09-25T18:35Z,"Thank You, F*ck Jtag that sh*t is old. RGH is the new way. I am calling out at work & telling my girl the we need a break. heheh"
,dogmatichangman,2012-09-25T18:43Z,"I suppose this is unplayable with XK3Y then, guess I'll give it a shot anyway. 
I thought ""JTAG only"" was stuff like homebrews and DLC's, not actual games released on DVD's, supposedly. Seriously, where do ppl pick up this shit?"
,DeadSilencE69,2012-09-25T21:33Z,"Thank you thenoobish, you make my day !"
,DJ_SEVEN,2012-09-25T23:23Z,"tag is the ONLY way, if you want to wait forever you go for at RGH fucked up machine, lamers run RGH because youre stupid enough not to know how to Jtag ;D"
,ravendrow,2012-09-25T23:48Z,seriously guys JTAG and RGH are Basically the same!!!!!!! they both run unsigned code they just use differing methods to accomplish the same thing how many times does that have to be said before you get it !!!!!!!! as for people in PAL region who say they cannot run NTSC games.... you guys need to check your Dash launch Settings make sure the Region switching option is enabled and you should be able to play all NTSC games i have a NTSC Slim and i run PAL games all the time. @ thenoobish thanks for the upload bro can't wait to check it out
,dududus,2012-09-26T00:13Z,"JTAG and RGH almost the same.. but hardly any JTAG exploitable boxes.. for RGH there are millions.

RGH changed me from a casual gamer to a hardcore one!"
,xxatawxx195,2012-09-26T00:29Z,thenoobish :) i thank you for releaseing this :D  i will seed for a day we o you because its a week sooner :o it's usally 2 days max thank i ask you to not seeding thank you 
,nos4r2d2,2012-09-26T01:36Z,If you have JTAG/RGH but don't use dash launch you can make the default.xex region free with X360GameHack. This will make NTSC run on PAL or vice versa but the problem is Title Updates will be incompatible because the default.xex has been changed.
,KunHulk,2012-09-26T06:20Z,thanks noobish 
,Super-E,2012-09-26T06:55Z,Whats about the Wasabi 360 that can execute ISO
,brock1384,2012-09-26T10:00Z,"Thank You. Can someone explain how to get this to work, I have an RGH console."

Into content are going only XBLA games, all JTAG rips and games goes to folder GAMES that you created before on your ext. hdd or usb... Use google to sort out your problem. Only wuestion is, how that you have JTAG and you don't know to transfer stuff from pc to box???"
,sharmaankur23,2012-09-26T15:17Z,how toput this game into hdd
,brock1384,2012-09-26T16:22Z,"OK, after extracting everything drag the last resident evil 6 folder onto your hdd inside your games folder. Its that simple."
,sharmaankur23,2012-09-26T18:02Z,Thanks for the help actually i have downloaded testament of sherlock homes that too was jtag but file was of unknown extention. Thats why i was wondering abt that

,FreakAlchemist,2012-09-27T01:14Z,"I have a J-Tag and a RGH

,DJ_SEVEN,2012-09-27T17:53Z,"Thanx noob, worx 100%, do feed on the bullshit the other lamers throw up!, if you cant or dont have the brains to get it to work, its really simple.

GO TO A STORE AND BUY THE FUCKIN THING!"
,fauzan18,2012-09-27T19:18Z,"can someone please tell me how good the gameplay is of resident evil 6 is it as good as resident evil 5 and 4,please tell me."
,slapdownhos,2012-09-27T20:03Z,"I know no one will answer this but i put this into the game folder like ive done with many others, I mapped it to the xbox 360 folder and the boxart shows up as biohazard 6. And it dont work when i hit play. kinda bummed. i know im doing something wrong. Something stupid."
,jakenator,2012-09-28T20:55Z,Thanks thenoobish works great! For people having trouble just extract everything until you have 1 resident evil 6 folder. Then put it in your games folder and load with xexmenu. Simple
,slapdownhos,2012-09-29T15:08Z,Thanks noobish. thanks jakenator
