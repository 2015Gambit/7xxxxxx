,DeipFTW,2012-09-26T01:41Z,"I think we should stop downloading these things illegally. I am. This is like almost 100,000 people lost because of the other uploads on this site and others, even streaming websites. Everyone who worked hard on the show didn't earn from them."
,adpen12,2012-09-26T02:14Z,"@DeipFTW

You do realize that this shows are broadcast over the air for no charge..The actors' pay isn't directly influenced by total viewership"
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-09-26T07:16Z,"@DeipFTW,
You have an account on TPB, and you're telling people to stop using torrents. If you have such a problem, just stay away. Stop saying stupid things.

@VTV, Thanks :) "
