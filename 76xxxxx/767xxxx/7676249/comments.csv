Its real. It got released on steam today. "
,Kayshu,2012-09-26T23:58Z,Works like a charm! Thank you!
,diablo124,2012-09-26T23:59Z,"Okay, for those of you that are having issues with finding setup-1.bin, when it prompts you to do it, stop the installation, unmount and remount it, then open the folder to view files. Then copy the setup-1 to your desktop or somewhere easy to access. Re-run the installation. When it prompts you to find setup-1.bin, browse to where you put it and select that folder. It'll install and you can enjoy it!"
,lambo517,2012-09-27T00:11Z,Hell Yeah! Thank you!
,UNIK_GOD,2012-09-27T00:26Z,Can somebody upload a torrent with the set-ups please ?
,HungryHitmonchan,2012-09-27T00:27Z,works 100% :D thanks jvarnell
,HungryHitmonchan,2012-09-27T00:29Z,-THIS DOESN'T WORK ONLINE-
,Brando328,2012-09-27T00:46Z,"Install Instruction:
1.Make a new folder (call it Castle Crashers or something)
2.Use a program that can mount/burn disc images (my preferred is PowerISO) to extract the contents of fan-cacr.bin to the folder you made
3.Then you may either run the extracted setup.exe or mount the image to a virtual disc drive to install
4.When prompted to find the next disc destination simply choose your folder you created and press ok.
5.The game will install and you can play :)
NOTE: I havent found a crack yet so unfortunately only single player is available"

No shit dumb fuck"
,HungryHitmonchan,2012-09-27T01:06Z,@sqad5 just trying to stop the incoming questions u dumb shit
,scrapy_94,2012-09-27T01:50Z,"Thank you very much :) this works perfectly maybe later i gonna upload a crack to play on multiplayer sorry for my bad english ^^ ;)
"
,Kayshu,2012-09-27T02:11Z,"@scrapy_94 if you get it, post here for us!!"
,shadowswimer,2012-09-27T02:42Z,"@UNIK_GOD

when it ask's for setup-1.bin, navigate to computer then select the drive that you mounted the iso, it should work, or you can open up the drive when its mounted and take the bin out of there and put it somewhere else :3"
,Speedwolf12,2012-09-27T04:04Z,"this is bullshit. i exactly know how to do this but its a VLC media file
which means i cant click on the file so all it appears is Castle_CRushhers Faniso And No ""arrow"" next to it to open it"
,dafamily,2012-09-27T04:55Z,"which button do you press when your on the map to go to the next stage??  I tried all the buttons but the game doesn't do nothing, and I'm using a keyboard!

Thanks for the help."
,tylerhw,2012-09-27T04:55Z,"@Speedwolf12: Trivial issue.

Hint: there's another button on your mouse that's not left click, it opens this magical menu that could lead you to a list of other programs to open the file with. One of them should work, I wonder which one? 

But you know what you're doing, so yeah, you can figure it out from there."
,s3xkitten,2012-09-27T04:58Z,"@Speedwolf12
You need to fucking learn how file types and virtual drives work before you start torrenting."
,tylerhw,2012-09-27T04:58Z,"Actually in reality you wouldn't even need to do that.

That's just to reassociate the file with the right program for luddites who prefer to just double click every file and have it open up all pretty for them."
,ufodave1947,2012-09-27T05:27Z,"The setup.exe is infected with Trojan.Zeroaccess!inf4

Download this only if you want a trojan.
You have been warned. "
,Keshire,2012-09-27T06:09Z,"The setup is a wrapper that contains adobejre.exe, definite trojan"
,Lmo613,2012-09-27T09:56Z,Thank you 
,Fugie,2012-09-27T15:16Z,"Thanks for the Trojan, asshole.

Everyone report this torrent."
,HungryHitmonchan,2012-09-27T22:33Z,no trojan for me. scanned it with 3 different anivirus systems
,Zebra667,2012-09-28T01:59Z,"Speedwolf12, YOU'VE WON ALL THE INTERNETZ!!1! To collect your prize, just open this .bin file and read the directions inside!...Oh wait...*facepalm*

Seriously, dude, don't come on TPB and tell everyone of your 'l33t' torrenting skillzors and then tell us you can't open the file (and thus the uploader is a dickhead for up'ing a fucked torrent) because YOU don't know how to re-associate files to open with different apps. Fuckin' dumbass, go back to playing Farmville on Facebook little boy and leave the adults to their grown-up games..."
,herpthederp,2012-09-28T09:18Z,"Hey thanks, works great."
,darelon,2012-09-28T09:32Z,"local multiplayer is POSSIBLE, u'll just need 2 or more xbox joysticks or any joysticks with xbox joystick emulator like x360ce http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/wiki/MainPage"
