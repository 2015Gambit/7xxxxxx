Seeing that this not on Pirate Bay, I thought I'd share it. This is the original theatrical release with TV extra scenes not available in any other release. Restored by fans who sent someone VHS tapes of the television broadcasts from around the world. So technically it is a TV Version, not a fan edit. And a great one at that. This was cleaned up beautifully with 2.0 stereo sound, optional subtitles that explain differences threw the whole movie, a soundtrack and more. It is however a Full Frame as it never aired with extra footage in Widescreen. This is NOT the Richard Donnor Cut or The Hybrid Cut. Someone (Steve Younis I think) put a lot of care into re-creating this.

Creator Steve Younis - "I found out about the extended cut of Superman II on supermancinema.co.uk website 4 years ago. I sought out a copy on ebay, paid 75 bucks, and got a seriously lousy copy on VHS. I was very intrigued by what I saw, especially the two extra break up scenes at the end.

Then... well... I had one of those quick silly thoughts most rational people ignore. What would happen if someone tried to rewrite history and make a better Superman II? Put back in some of the better Donner moments, take out some of the really awful Lester moments, add some new effects, that kind of thing. I was hoping to raise awareness about Donner's lost work. Before I could do anything I needed to get the footage. Cutting out the long boring stuff... I got the footage, but found myself in the middle of a strange situation. If I put in some extra elbow grease I could do something else as well... reassemble the entire International Cut to make sure it doesn't get lost. No matter how bad some of it is, there will always be those people who want to see everything, so I started there.

I first finished RIC 2 years ago, but it just wasn't as good as it could've been. Again, long story short, I took another crack at it, and you have the final results.

In the end... the project took about 4 years, and roughly about $10,000 to make happen. Now that's for everything mind you spread out over 4 years."
