Lyrics:
 I'm a sailor peg
And I lost my leg
I climbed up the topsails
I lost my leg

I'm shipping up to boston
(whoa oh oh)
I'm shipping up to boston
(whoa oh oh)
I'm shipping up to boston
(whoa oh oh)
I'm shipping off
To fing my wooden leg

I'm a sailor peg
And I lost my leg
I climbed up the topsails
I lost my leg

I'm shipping up to boston
(whoa oh oh)
I'm shipping up to boston
(whoa oh oh)
I'm shipping up to boston
(whoa oh oh)
I'm shipping off
To fing my wooden leg
