,daniel.drache,2012-09-26T20:24Z,"Awesome, I can try it before spurgling $30 on the alpha"
,isilox,2012-09-26T20:35Z,"Exactly, this is the game I'd gladly buy, let me try it first.

Anyone else waiting for castle crasher here after their fuckup lauchn on steam?"
,kirtasheks,2012-09-26T20:42Z,"soo, is this legit?"
,kodamann,2012-09-26T20:49Z,Does this torrent have any viruses? i downloaded it and avg freaked out about the main executable...curious if it's actually a virus or just avg being dumb
,isilox,2012-09-26T21:02Z,Microsoft antivir found it ok... and it seems legit.
,kodamann,2012-09-26T21:03Z,does it have problems?
,isilox,2012-09-26T21:50Z,"It runus fine, but is obviously still in alpha. I'd say wait for a few month at least before downloading, not really ready for playing now."
,Trooper11,2012-09-27T20:03Z,"Nothing working for me. None of the images in-game load, it shows the names and shadows, but can't see anything else. Do we need more than these 4 files?"
,Linus371,2012-09-27T23:37Z,"Downloaded at 5 mb/s.
Works perfectly, thanks."
,athrowaway,2012-09-28T04:01Z,"@Trooper11 Yeah I have the same problem on my main computer. It works on my netbook, so it's a bug with some computers. I'll buy the game once this is fixed."
,daniel.drache,2012-09-28T08:24Z,"No viruses, Works fairly well for me, But it is an Alpha"
,Ghastyyy,2012-09-28T21:45Z,"Cool. It works for me.
Maybe next time people will release some demos. Not gonna drop 30 for an unfinished game."
,iceburn91,2012-09-30T18:13Z,VIRUS!
,ShmadolfShmitler,2012-10-01T05:02Z,Can anyone put up the mac version?  Sorry in advance for being a gigantic faggot.
,willywilly,2012-10-03T13:46Z,"Yeah, a Mac torrent would be nice. I want to try this game before buying it for $30 fucking dollars and I get graphical errors when playing it via VMware."
,LEGOMAN42,2012-10-04T02:15Z,"i would love to see the mac version of this game so i wouldn't have to boot into windows all the time to just play it. this is a good upload though. very very fun game. it's even better when you give yourself as much money as you want.

to make it easier just search for ""balance"" in the save file and give yourself as much as you want. 

open up the save file in notepad"
,LEGOMAN42,2012-10-04T03:04Z,"@Ghastyyy thanks for being stupid. do you honestly think you ONLY get the alpha version for 30 dollars? i truly hope you aren't this stupid.

Plus this game is still extremely fun with all the bugs!"
,Menoetiuz,2012-10-04T03:37Z,"When I try to start the game, it comes up with a black screen and won't load. I have given it over 10 minutes to try to load up, but nothing happened. I had to manually turn my computer off and back on to get it to work again. Can anyone help?"
,Menoetiuz,2012-10-04T03:38Z,"Yes, I do realize this is in Alpha, so I don't expect the game to work perfectly for everyone."
,theannoyed1,2012-10-04T04:18Z,"This game is still really broke, but even then it's quite fun.
I keenly await the 1.0."
,Sl4v3,2012-10-04T23:13Z,"For those of you who gets black screen follow these steps.

1. Right click on ""prison architect""
2. Properties
3. Compatibility
4. Mark Privilege Level ""Run this program as an administrator""

This solution solved the problem for me."
