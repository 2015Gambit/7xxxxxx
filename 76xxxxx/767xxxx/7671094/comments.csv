,darkpiro,2012-09-26T01:12Z,TS Means Telesync. Meaning they took an external audio source and sync'd the video and audio together so they would match. Next time you don't know something use Google.
,Nietmust,2012-09-27T07:13Z,Why inform text england if there even aint any
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-29T06:25Z,"@darkpiro: I see you used google, but still got it wrong. 

A TS (telesync) is a camcorder that syncs its framerate to the screen, resulting in a ""cam"" video w/o any flicker. At least, that's what it used to mean, although there's so much crap online these days that you can probably find any definition you want on google.

(Hence, if this is the same cam video, it is probably not a ts--not if there's any flicker.)"
