After spending dozens of hours raiding tombs, searching for hidden civilizations and saving the galaxy, every so often itΓÇÖs good to go old-school and put in some time on an old-fashioned platformer. Thing is, sometimes the simpler a game is, the worse it is on your blood pressure. This can easily be said for The Adventures of Shuggy, which can be totally controlled using the fingers of one hand, yet can be frustrating enough to cause the utterance of rather colorful oaths.

You play as Shuggy, a very cute cartoon vampire who inherits a spooky castle filled with all manner of nasties. The castle contains 116 rooms that have to be cleared of all of their malevolent squatters before you can move in. You do this by various means, all of which involve the collecting of shiny gems.

Picture from The Adventures of Shuggy PC reviewShuggy is a throwback to the days when you didnΓÇÖt need to learn dozens of keyboard/mouse combinations to control your games. All you need are the WASD keys for movement, plus a jump button and one to trigger any special ability that might be in play. Specific keys can be reconfigured through the options menu (pro tip: when mapping the ability key, use one located far enough away from the movement cluster that you have to use your free hand. Unless, of course, you enjoy playing Finger Twister.). The 100+ rooms are spread out amongst five areas. Enter any room with an open door by standing in front of it and pressing the ability key. Once inside, you have to pick up all of the gems in the maze without touching an enemy, which results in instant death. Clearing a room unlocks others in your current hub area, and each hub has a room that houses a boss that has to be defeated.
