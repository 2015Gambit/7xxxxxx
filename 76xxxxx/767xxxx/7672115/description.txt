Don't Blame Me is a comprehensive documentary of rock superstar Ozzy Osbourne that explores in-depth his personal and professional life. Osbourne discusses information about his attempted suicide, his recovery from drug and alcohol abuse, his highly publicized stage antics, battling accusations he was a Satan worshiper, and a very personal look at his home life. This documentary includes music from his live-concert performances, such as "N.I.B.," "I Don't Know," "Mr. Crowley," "Mama, I'm Coming Home," and "War Pigs." Also included are interviews with members of Metallica, Motorhead, Mötley Crüe, Jon Bon Jovi, Alice Cooper, and with the Ozman himself, painting not only a stark examination of a rock superstar's life, but of that lifestyle as well.
