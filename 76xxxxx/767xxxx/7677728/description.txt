Episode 6 of 6

Dale Maily is at London's Gay Pride looking
for some answers to homosexuality, while
James and Barnaby are explaining the changes
being made to the NHS under Andrew Lansley's
new Health and Social Care Reform Bill. The
Google Home View team are out in force - in
people's homes. And while the Barclays Casino
comes to Canary Wharf, private school boys
are out in Brixton collecting for a local
charity - their school.
