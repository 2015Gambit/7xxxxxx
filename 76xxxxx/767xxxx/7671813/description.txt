This version of Counter Strike Source is 1.0.0.75,just install the game and you ready to play on NoSteam servers

NOTES : 
1: On this version of game you can change your name from game just type "setname YourName"
2: On this version server browser form Internet tab is not working but you have on History tab up to 1000 servers to play added by me.

With this version you can play only on updated servers  ,if you try to connect 
to one server and game reply to you "The server you are trying to connect to is running an older version of game " 
is because that server did not update to latest version of Counter Strike Source. 

If you try to connect to one server and game reply to you 
"The server you are trying to connect to is running a newer version of the game" ,it's time 
to go on www.aviara.ro/forum ,and take UPDATE PATCH.

If you have WIN7 and after installing game you have an error on your screen ,
ignore it because the game is installed correctly.


If your Video Card is older ,open game,go to Options ,Video ,Advanced and set to low or disabled.

With this version you can play only ON CRACKED SERVERS ,if game reply to you "Steam Validation Rejected ,
that server is not cracked to accept Non Steam Clients. 

VALVE IS UPDATING PERIODICALLY CS:SOURCE ,IF YOU CANNOT CONNECT TO UPDATED SERVERS,
VISIT http://www.aviara.ro/forum/ AND TAKE THE UPDATE PATCH.
