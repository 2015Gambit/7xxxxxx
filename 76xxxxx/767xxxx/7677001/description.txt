"Bringing Up Baby"

Jay's birthday is upon us again and, as 
before, he makes it well-known that he wishes 
to keep it as low key as possible, with no 
grand gestures or surprises. But leave it to 
the family to miss the mark yet again! Phil 
takes Jay on a very unconventional fishing 
trip with his buddies, and Gloria struggles 
with how to break the pregnancy news to him. 
Meanwhile, Dylan moves into the Dunphy 
household temporarily, and Mitch and Cam 
decide to look into adopting a cat as they 
continue to cope with their failed attempt to 
adopt another child.

Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
