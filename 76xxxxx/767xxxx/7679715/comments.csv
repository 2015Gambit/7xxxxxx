,Weylen007,2012-09-29T07:29Z,"Hi, firstly thanks for the awesome guides. Really appreciate it. Secondly, I can't seem to find the 1-90 guide in here? Or must it still be added? And lastly, can you by any chance get your hands on X-Elerated guides?"
,Ylts,2012-09-29T13:10Z,X-Elerated guide looks like copy of zygor :/
,TheFreeRevolution,2012-09-29T19:41Z,"Its in there, it only activates normally if you are 85, if not you have to go in and activate it manually. 

X-Elerated guides are just the common bullshit guides, Zygor is better for leveling and the gold guide is just common sense, go here: http://tarouwowguides.com/ for gold guides."
