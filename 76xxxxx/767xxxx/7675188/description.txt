Information
------------------------------

From the sea horse that mates in an hypnotic underwater ballet to the rodent who copulates until he literally drops dead, THE NATURE OF SEX spans the globe to illustrate how an astonishing diversity of life forms find their mates and conceive, raise, and protect their offspring. This Web companion to the four-part series takes a close look at the primal instinct that causes animals to come together in order to pass along their genes to the next generation. We also examine how timing can be key in the mating process, and how varied sex contracts create not only new life, but diversity, in both animals and humans.



3)  The Sex Contract 
Every year, millions of brides and grooms promise to love and care for each other 'till death do they part. It's a profound promise. But marriage is also just one of the natural world's many mating arrangements, as THE SEX CONTRACT, Part 3 of NATURE's THE NATURE OF SEX shows. Throughout nature, males and females negotiate a wide range of carefully made plans for conceiving and raising offspring.
