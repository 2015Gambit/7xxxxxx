Or if u can help me with the software name that i can use for MAC.

Your help is appreciated."

personally, i think subler for mac ought to do the trick.

also, since the source for these videos is dvd i.e. not an HD source, this is the best quality that can be achieved. Sure, u will find '720p DVDrips' but those are just upscaled, similar to zooming into an image and expecting detail to magically appear."
