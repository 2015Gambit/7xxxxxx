Marie Colvin is a remarkable woman and one of the world's more courageous human beings. This is the only documentary she appeared in before her death in Syria in February of 2012. I specifically uploaded this for someone who may be interested in her life and work. She died bravely and she died doing what she loved. Finally, albeit tragically, peace is now finally hers.

I will seed this for as long as I am alive, have electricity, and access to the internet.
