  Underneath it all, underneath all the glamour and stardom, No Doubt remain a group of SoCal kids enraptured by the ska revival and new wave. ThatΓÇÖs their common language, so when they reunited for 2o12ΓÇÖs Push and Shove, their first album in over ten years, they returned to this shared bond, using it as a back-to-roots template for an album that deftly weaves in contemporary sounds without ever pandering. Part of this dexterity is due to No Doubt expanding their love of ska outward toward reggae and dancehall, underlining their affection with bouncing elastic rhythms and a heavy dose of patois. This remains the same stylish, hooky pop that turned No Doubt into unexpected superstars in the back half of the ΓÇÿ90s.
