,adishonerv69,2012-09-27T14:12Z,"thank you so much for your effort in making these wonderful radio shows available here until, as you say, the other place is up again. I see them as food for the mind and although I can listen live online, the commercials during brakes are really annoying. So I believe I speak for many people when I say your work here is much appreciated "
