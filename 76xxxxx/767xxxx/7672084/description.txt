This is a great no frills collection of some of the greatest performances of what many consider the greatest band of the 1970's. The first disc features a great performance from a 1970 show at the Royal Albert Hall. The second disc shows the band's evolution throughout the decade that they dominated. Of particular interest is the chapter featuring the 1973 Madison Square Garden show that was filmed for The Song Remains the Same featuring outtake performances including wonderful versions of their classics "Misty Mountain Hop" and "The Ocean". Also, you get to see several songs from what would be their final British concert at the 1979 Knebworth Festival. However, the whole two disc set is a treat for all Zeppelin fans.
