I'm sorry, James Last - This is not my rip. Downloaded as is. 

Therefore, nothing can make a new rip."

,cottager,2012-09-26T01:41Z,"Thanks, unfortunately I do not play music on the computer, I use network players that can play from server including flac and other codecs. Not that I complain, but it would be nice to have this music in high rez flac, I know that this is not very easy to do. 
Thanks for the post. "
,cottager,2012-09-26T01:43Z,"one more question, if you play them in foobar, can you extract to high rez flac or other lossles ?"
