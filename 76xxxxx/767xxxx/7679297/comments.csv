,babybluetits24,2012-09-28T16:32Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1964634/ imdb score 2.5/10 budget $50k !!!

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 1165 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! )  if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out (eg if its porn what type eg lesbien) ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,FieroGT,2012-09-29T01:07Z,"@babybluetits24   and to everyone that cares to listen and understand how bandwidth works...

i just had to say this,...  

everything u say is true and good to do for the community in general.

EXCEPT, don't ever set your UL speed to unlimited or max. it will kill yer download speed and make any general internet browsing, etc slow. while yes, the more you seed the more u may well get back is mostly true. it only works ok up to a specific point. and that point is different for each person. basically u wanna ul as much as u can without actually pegging your ul bandwidth. best thing to do, is go do a speed test over at speakeasy.net . and once u find out yer max ul speed, set your torrent app ul to sumthin like 90% of that. so for example, if u can ul at 600k, i would set your ul to 500k. that leaves some speed avail for other  things, such as the overhead that will be there no matter what. and if u plan on doing anything thing else while your  downloading, like web browsing, etc. all those things will use up some ul bandwidth. so you wanna leave a little left over so stuff can use it. worst case if u max it out, there wont be extra bandwidth for the download overhead, and then it will actually slow down.

sorry long winded ass post. but i just had to clear that up. i've been doing this stuff now for years, so i know whats what.  plus i'm sure this has been said somewhere else before also.
