Wild Lemurs of Madagascar
Charlotte Uhlenbroek travels to Madagascar to follow the story of three mother ring-tailed lemurs struggling to survive one of the driest and hottest seasons in decades. One lemur has already lost her baby, the other two have a fight on their hands if their infants are to stand a chance, and matters are made even worse when neighbouring lemur tribes invade the mothers' territories, following ring-tailed lemurs for two weeks. They live in a female-dominated, hierarchical society. Uhlenbroek also has some great shots of white lemurs called silky sifakas hopping around on the ground, and their movements are so peculiar they look like they're dancing.
