,Kole97,2012-09-27T08:28Z,"Big Brother should have clearly defined ""strategic nomination"" for them - maybe even giving them criterea. Big Brother attempted this actually - telling them criterea like ""flying under the radar"", ""playing all house mates, being on good terms with everyone"", ""being a strong physical/mental competitor"" - people like Josh/Michael/Benjamin/Zoe. The people in the house are so dumbďťż that 90% of them still nominated for personal reasons. Ridiculous, RIDICULOUS !

Thanx TvTeam"
