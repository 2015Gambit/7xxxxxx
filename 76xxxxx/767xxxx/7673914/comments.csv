I also can't help but notice that you never leave your oh-so-insightful comments on any of the LEFT wing stuff I upload. You have all the depth of a puddle."
,lapis2,2012-09-29T02:34Z,"technically every republican from about 1960 on is a neocon.  its kind of a pointless moniker, like the  word liberal.  but yeah, every book in this series is total horse shit."

Thank you.
