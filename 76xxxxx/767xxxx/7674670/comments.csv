,w4r3zh4ck,2012-09-26T15:11Z,where is the 32 bit?
,crazymadcat,2012-09-26T16:44Z,"Dickhead, at least say THANK YOU..."
,mokies,2012-09-26T16:52Z,"^

I bet they're just releasing it for 64-bit, much like what happened with AE & PP since CS5."
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-09-26T17:47Z,"@crazymadcat
Unlike you, I have contributed to this site and I will contribute even more. If you still doubt me just check my profile. Please don't insult next time."
,BernardoPhoenix,2012-09-26T19:07Z,I'll be testing this one out for sure...many thanks!
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-09-26T19:49Z,@w4r3zh4ck - It is produced only for 64 bit mate.
,buls,2012-09-26T19:59Z,"thanks...  i start using it, working like charm...  i like  patch is much easier than the previous one"
,BernardoPhoenix,2012-09-26T20:11Z,"Flawless!  Patch is ""idiot"" proof :)"
,gluhgluhgluh,2012-09-27T00:35Z,Any chance to get new NewBlue effects ?including titler pro ? You can fix program but not effects ? Who the hell is nuts here ? Since Demonoid died whole pirate world is gone ! Where is the resistance ? Where is the rebel spirit ? Fuck the Fascists !  
,bafakos76,2012-09-27T14:38Z,many thanks uploader...hope the plugins work on this version too
,Dzwoneczek007,2012-09-27T16:55Z,"Patch is not working. Im installing without internet connection, copying patch to the install folder, run & patch, than I run Vegas Pro and register windows appears and it wants keycode..."
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-09-27T20:17Z,@Dzwoneczek007 - Application may request serial on first open. Close and open again problem will be sorted.
,Dzwoneczek007,2012-09-27T22:54Z,"It's not working. This patch is doing nothing for me. I can only run trial version or write a key for a full version, nothing else."
,GoldenNightWolf,2012-09-28T02:18Z,"As BernardoPhoenix said..lol it's idiot proof...
I must be an idiot, because I do not understand this. |D"
,LadyAshura,2012-09-28T10:08Z,"Make it idiot proof, they will make a better idiot. 

=)"
,Dzwoneczek007,2012-09-28T12:12Z,"Because nobody said, that first U NEED TO RUN TRIAL VERSION, than You need to apply patch...
It's a rather important information that was missing.

PS.
Do You guys also have problems with rendering? Ive got some weird stripes on the whole video and can't render anything. In Vegas Pro 11 I didn't have problems like that."
,bafakos76,2012-09-28T18:43Z,installed fine and running like a charm..i can also import projects from previous version of vegas :)))
,JKorso,2012-09-28T21:05Z,Wonder why always a new Vegas doesn't support ANY import file format. Anyone?
,RayZorPL,2012-09-29T00:57Z,"Not working to me, I have runned a trial version now and then applied this patch, still a trial version :<
Can someone make a step-by-step tutorial for this ? :D
Would appreciate, thanks!"
,razielnr1,2012-09-29T23:12Z,"@Ching_Liu, 
Are you be able to make a keymaker or sth to application named Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect 9.3? CORE group made keymakers to this app but to previous versions. "
,HunterOSx,2012-09-30T01:44Z,When ever I put video into the timeline (sound works fine) it just instantly crashes. WTF???
,rythkai,2012-09-30T02:30Z,"Whenever I try to open it, before or after patch, it crashes and won't open, tried sooo many times, but doesn't work."
,Revan22,2012-10-01T00:54Z,"For those with the patch not working uninstall and re-install without changing the install location, it's a poorly written patch that only works from default install location. Then I guess if u need to try copying Vegas Pro 12 folder somewhere uninstalling and reinstalling then put the copy onto of the new install, beware I haven't tried this myself it may not work."
,Revan22,2012-10-01T01:08Z,"Update:  Tested my suggestion of copying working default patched install location to a new install in a different location and it doesn't work. Well if u wanted to spend hrs going through registry u might get it working but since the install is aprox half a GB its not worth worrying about, cause if u don't have that much space on a HDD you need to do a clean up and if u have less space than that on an SSD your damaging it never fill them past 80% capacity it shortens their lifespans."
,TL50S,2012-10-04T17:02Z,Mine did not come with anything in the patch folder
