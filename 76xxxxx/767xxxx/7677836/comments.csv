,machspee,2012-09-27T14:01Z,"A lot of  you guys are downloading this because you saw J.K Rowling name on it. 

This book doesn't have any fantasy or magic elements. Its an ADULT FICTION book.

Don't have any high expectations like you had with Harry Potter books. "

,peilass,2012-09-27T20:19Z,Many thanks -- and so soon after the launch -- hope it's worth the wait.

,annick1,2012-09-28T00:54Z,Thank you much :)
,J3rryKo42O,2012-09-29T09:20Z,@machspee: It would be pretty stupid if they did since she has said repeatedly that this is a completely different universe than the potter books. So I'm pretty sure they know what they are downloading.
