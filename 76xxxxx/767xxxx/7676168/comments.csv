Of all these hundreds that got this, I see this is how you guys work......  Fine... Have it yr way.  That just mean excruciating slow speed for everyone else from here on... Those of you that's finish getting this from here on, hope you are at least considerate enuf to keep it seeding so that those people after you won't get the excruciating slow speed you are getting now....
