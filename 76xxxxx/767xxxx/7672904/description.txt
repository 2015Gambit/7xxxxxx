Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, September 25 edition of Infowars Live, Alex Jones breaks down the latest news, including information from a French surgeon working within Syria confirming that half of "rebels" are in fact Al-Qaeda terrorists, Agenda 21's micro-apartments appealing to "trendies" that value the good of the earth over their own lives, a gruesome story of a Chinese man who stood up to forced government relocation, but was literally crushed for doing so, and more. 

Alex also welcomes guest Carl Mayer, the attorney representing American Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges in his legal battle to keep President Obama's power to send US citizens to military prisons without right to trial or attorney, or NDAA privilege, at bay.
