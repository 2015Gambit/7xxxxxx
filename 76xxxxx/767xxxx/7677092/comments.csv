Btw is there anyway you could get Steins;Gate Part one in dual audio? Or is it still too early for those questions since it just came out on Sept. 25th? Lol"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-09-27T09:00Z,"Chendrix, Daman said he would upload Steins;Gate as soon as he can get his hands on it. "

,mikron24,2012-09-28T08:17Z,is it just me the quality of video is not that great 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-28T09:51Z,mikron are you even using a 10bit supported Player/Codecs
,wanderlustus,2012-09-28T22:12Z,"Using VLC, I've got nothing but green screen, and audio.

Haven't tried it on my main player.  What gives?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-28T22:51Z,"wanter, as i said earlier this is a 10bit video, either update VLC or use MPC/k-lite codecs"
