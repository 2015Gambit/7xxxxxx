    [Notes]

    Fight Or Flight, the new album from Hoobastank, marks the beginning of what
    promises to be a vital new chapter in the nearly two-decade run of the
    versatile L.A. band. This musically and emotionally intense work is
    Hoobastank s initial release on Open E Entertainment following a productive
    decade on Island Records during which they ruled the modern rock charts,
    crossed over big-time with the iconic smash The Reason and sold 10 million
    albums.
