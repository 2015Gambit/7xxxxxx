,STFmaryville,2012-09-26T13:58Z,Thanks very much. No offense intended but why do 6 people scan Avengers? I know it's popular but LOL
,cracky-ch,2012-09-26T14:10Z,Somehow you're missing all of Empire and TheGroup releases of DC stuff. Is that intentional?
,dbranson17,2012-09-26T17:19Z,"Any, any chance of IDW Ghostbuster issues 11 and 12?  Just can't find them anywhere...

thanx"
,cccomics,2012-09-26T22:26Z,I see Dark Tower: Man in Black 4 here. Anyone seen issue 3?
,cccomics,2012-09-26T22:34Z,can't find the Dark Tower: Man in Black issue 3. 
,Extremist,2012-09-26T23:22Z,Thanks!
,mgonz4,2012-09-27T04:48Z,The Dark Tower - The Man In Black 003... PLEASE...!!!
,Extremist,2012-09-27T20:47Z,"Issue 3 isn't scanned yet, just wait and it'll show up."
,Extremist,2012-09-27T20:53Z,"The Man In Black #3 isn't scanned yet, same goes for Ghostbuster #11 & 12. Just wait and someone will scan them... Or you can go out and *GASP*  BUY them!"
