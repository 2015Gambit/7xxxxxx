,JakeThe44,2012-09-27T16:43Z,"hahaha you people are so dumb. Of coarse it's an aweful show, that's the point. Like Family Guy, American Dad, South Park, hell, even The Simpsons were pushing the envelope back in the day. That's the whole point. None of these shows are suppose to be educational or meaningful. Go watch the Gospel channel or something for that."
,ThePointman,2012-09-28T03:43Z,"exactly jake, what the fuck are people expecting from this show? It's not going to be riveting or poetic, it's designed to be pure shock value and gutter humor. If your brow is too high for that, go watch reruns of Frasier."

i also smoked a blunt before wathching"
