This is where the Weavers, a typical suburban family, have decided to move to. But upon their relocation to this community they discover that this place is populated by residents who are actually from another planet, using names of sport athletes, where men can become pregnant, receive nourishment through their eyes and mind by reading books rather than eating, and cries out green goo from their ears. Not only that, it appears that these aliens have been stuck on Earth for 10 years, still awaiting for a distress signal to return home."
