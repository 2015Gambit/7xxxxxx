Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 4498  seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! )  if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc"

,TtToker,2012-09-27T20:37Z,"@babybluetits24, if you read the nfo, there is an IMDB link. do you want a cookie for all the good you've done or just attention? people know they should seed and you telling people won't change anything. there are people on every page begging for seeders and just because you said, you did your share so now its others turn to, thats just extra stupid. as long as you're still downloading, you haven't done your share of seeding.

,greasyHampster,2012-09-27T23:45Z,And You can set your upload speed to just 9kbs and still DL at maximum speed. so quit feeding people your BS..... I think you might actually get the UP speed down to 7 B4 it starts hindering you DL speed.
,greasyHampster,2012-09-27T23:52Z,"and ive never had trouble DL'ing any movie within 10, 15 min so Why anyone ever whines is beyond me, but your guaranteed to see tears flowing on EVERY torrent. i usually get a chuckle out of a few each time i feel like wasting a min while DL'ing. so thanks for the laughs bitches> P.S. seeding is for losers"
,Xboy40,2012-09-28T00:40Z,"Decided I didn't want to wait to download this, so I redboxed it.  It's an ok movie but I wouldn't call it a horror movie.  It's more of a 'made for tv suspenseful drama'.

This is an interesting and different role for Eric McCormack so if you're a fan, you would need to see this.

,gekfoot,2012-09-28T01:05Z,"9kbs per second before it affects your speed? Damn, I keep mine at 5kbs per second. I guess I'll unfortunately have to waste some of my bandwidth an increase it a bit.

Also another tip: if you're using uTorrent then go options>auto shutdown>quit when downloads complete

Now you can leave your computer and as soon it you are finished downloading, uTorrent will close down so you don't waste your bandwidth seeding."
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2012-09-28T01:51Z,"Having an UL speed of 9kbs is fine, if everyone who DL the movie did that, and seeded for at least 48 hours, it would be great, and they wouldn't even notice the lack of bandwidth."
,weirwolfe,2012-09-28T07:29Z,Gekfoot. Thanks for utorrent tip. 
,dubblue4,2012-09-28T17:55Z,thanks
,Dreadmore,2012-09-28T19:03Z,"If your like me and you hate movies that end with no closure or explanation don't bother downloading this..

@AngeloPappas I don't know why you would come on here and post a comment like that, You sound like the biggest loser on the planet.. Throw in a bit of racism and it would be the universe 

Although It is pointless for people to complain about the seeds and dl speed, At most you might get a couple people to seed that wouldn't of anyway. High speed internet or Death!"

,Bmikes23,2012-09-29T07:28Z,Fuck off if you aren't talking about the quality of the movie or any other details.
