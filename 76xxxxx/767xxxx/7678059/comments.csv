,-darkangl-,2012-09-27T19:32Z,Thanks!  She was always a favorite.  Her eyes are amazing.  Her and Marley I think her name was were two favorites of mine from around that time.
,fieldof,2012-09-27T19:55Z,Interesting how those who vote negative above always fail to leave a note to explain themselves.
,-darkangl-,2012-09-27T23:45Z,"Yeah, who knows.  There's too many sour people in the world.  You can not like the girl without giving the torrent a negative.  The torrent is great."
,SR4T9US,2012-09-28T01:20Z,"Don't take it the wrong way but since when does somebody need to explain themselves? You guys do a great job, but I hope you're not in it to gain likes and votes... unless that's the way you get a skull.. plus 1 from me always..."
,fieldof,2012-09-28T05:07Z,"@SR4T9US:  If someone does not clarify their negative vote with an explanation, how are posters to know how to improve their future posts?

And since you're being defensive, I'll assume YOU have failed to explain your negative votes in the past."
,-darkangl-,2012-09-28T05:18Z,"There's nothing wrong with your post fieldof.  For all anyone knows the guy meant to hit +1 and didn't have his mouse in the right spot when he clicked.  It could be anything.  I would make one suggestion for future torrents though.  I would get rid of the index files.  They're not really necessary and are just more to download.  Just my suggestion.  Other than that, your postings are very much appreciated.  Don't let one neg irritate you."
[V],bestec1234,2012-09-30T01:44Z,Dude.  Ignore the quality ratings.  They're completely meaningless.  They're junk.  They're crap.  Don't look at them; don't worry about them.
,fieldof,2012-09-30T02:50Z,"I'm not ""worried"".  I was merely curious."
