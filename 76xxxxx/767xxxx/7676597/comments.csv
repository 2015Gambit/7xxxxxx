DON'T KNOW WHAT DC++ IS YOU SAY????

LOL bleh..most don't.  It's a file sharing protocol that existed before torrents.  Everyone has their own file share list and everyone shares with everyone.  With the combination of everyones lists you get every movie/comic/whatever.

Sometimes you can't find new releases...for comics though you will always find the new releases even before thepiratebay.  Google DC++ and learn to use it.  You won't regret it"
