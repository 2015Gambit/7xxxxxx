A=10, V=10

#NOTE: This is an ISO
Some specs: 1920*1080, 23.976fps, DTS and 3 Subs; Dutch, English and French.

#THE EASIEST WAY (That I've discovered) TO DEAL WITH AN ISO FILE IS TO USE WinRAR AND JUST ""Extract"" IT! NO DISCS, NO SETTINGS, WinRAR WILL SIMPLY RESTORE THE ISO TO IT'S ORIGINAL STATE RIGHT ON YOUR HDD! (If you have WinRAR installed, just Right Click this .ISO, then select ""Extract Here"" or another ""Extract"" choice)

AFTER YOU EXTRACT THIS ISO YOU WILL END UP WITH A COMPLETE BLU-RAY FOLDER, THAT, COULD BE BURNED TO A DISC. THERE ARE 3 MOVIE FILES, NAMELY; 00000.m2ts, 01200.m2ts and 01201.m2ts. I PREFER TO HAVE JUST 1 FILE SO I USED ts_MUXER TO 'JOIN' THESE FILES INTO 1.

I HOPE THIS HELPS!"
