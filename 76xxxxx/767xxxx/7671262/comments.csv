I hope it's good because the comic is one of my 2-3 favorite graphic novels."

,dominant133,2012-09-28T09:02Z,"awesome, thanks mate!"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-09-29T05:40Z,"Sweet!
I was SO tempted to see this in theaters after that guy shot up that premier. Which is RARE. I went to see MI4 in theaters in december, other than that, I haven't paid for a film in over 2 years. (Doesn't help that I have a projector set up @ 128 inches in my house)."
,TaiTheGuy,2012-09-30T00:32Z,"Buuut... This isn't that movie- it's a friggin CARTOON!!!
Don't get me wrong, my favorite shows are animated. But, my favorite shows are FUNNY too.
Thanks, but i'll pass."

Loving the context in the first comment, which was then cruelly undercut in the second comment with complaints about how ignorant you were for not actually knowing the difference between the words RISES and RETURNS. Stellar effort right there."

I still want this to make money, though. I'm sure it will get a reasonable profit for what it's worth, but I want it to sell even better than that. That will be good for everyone if WB and DC gets a lot of money for doing this."
,ComicalCallan,2012-10-03T17:25Z,"For the torrent, it's perfect quality and sound.
You won't get any other copy better than this one.

For the movie, it is amazing!
I'd put it on par with Under the Red Hood, if not, higher!
The fighting scenes in this movie are incredible, and the story line is great."
