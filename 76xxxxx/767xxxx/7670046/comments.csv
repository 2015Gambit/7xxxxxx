,husn2503,2012-09-25T04:37Z,working fine i just tested it thanks
,TrollTacos,2012-09-25T06:00Z,This is not the new guide.. I downloaded and extracted it. It does not have the MoP leveling guides or any MoP content.
,TrollTacos,2012-09-25T06:03Z,"This is not the new guide, it has no MoP content or MoP leveling. "
,Raikalo,2012-09-25T07:54Z,"This DOES have MoP content; you can browse the files and see, clearly, things like HordeLevelingMOP.lua and etc."
,smsrc,2012-09-25T08:22Z,"I didn't have to unpack/extract mine. Just deleted the last two zygor folders (ZygorTalentAdvisor and ZygorGuidesViewer) put this new folder that said ""ZygorGuidesViewer"" into my Addons folder. I'm in-game now and it works perfectly. Looks like they condensed the 2 folders into just one. Once you are in-game, make sure you check ""load out of date addons"" and ""Zygor Guides Viewer 3"" on the character page. Hope that helps someone out. 

P.S. don't believe comments from users with Troll in their name..."
,missemmy01,2012-09-25T08:55Z,SMSRC's advice worked. I couldn't get it to load correctly and that did the trick! All the MOP content is there! Can't wait! THANKS!
,NetBlaise,2012-09-25T10:14Z,Is this the full version or ther trial? is this better then Dugi? haven't tried this one yet...
,Ylts,2012-09-25T11:26Z,"Its full version and has working MoP zone guides, leveling as of right now"
,xiafeng,2012-09-25T12:55Z,"I can't get this to work no matter what I do.  I've followed all the instructions and when I load it up in game the only guide available in-game is Macros, yet all the other guides are listed in the folder."
,Quiturbishn,2012-09-25T15:25Z,"i am having issues also i get it downloaded and put in and i load all out of date addons but when i go in to load a guide the only guides it gives me is macro's and dungeons am i missing something or is it the guide can some one please help

,candiecdd,2012-09-25T15:34Z,Also have only Dungeons and Macros guides working...any help plase?
,Quiturbishn,2012-09-25T15:43Z,Ok i logged on to my lvl 72 and it loaded the guide i also logged on to my 85 and it loaded 85 to 90 but when i log on to the pandas it wont load the guide for them am i doing something wrong or am i missing something please help 
,Stardenn,2012-09-25T15:51Z,"Panda stuff missing is a known issue by the zygor admins, they updated their guide to fix it, the uploader needs to get a new copy and torrent that.

,tomgutteridge,2012-09-25T15:59Z,works a treat for me. I deleted my old zygor folder and copied this one and in. thanks for the upload

Going to try and get the update soon if TPB lets me, if not then it will be on KAT"
,Stardenn,2012-09-25T18:18Z,"Thanks TFR, any chance you can post here when you've uploaded it?"
