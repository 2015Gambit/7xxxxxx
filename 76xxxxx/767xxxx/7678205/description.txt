[1080p][X-Art.] Maya (Photo Fantasy / 28.09.12)


Photography, fortunately, to me has not only been a profession but also a contact between people - to understand human nature and record, if possible, the best in each individual." ~ Nickolas Muray (February 15th, 1892-November 2, 1965)
I really love this quote and I believe that many photographers do. This is one of the philosophies we have when working at X-Art. To always strive to bring out the best in all of our models.
On another but similar note: what man or woman photographer hasn't imagined a photo shoot leading to hot sex on the studio floor (especially when the model is smoking hot!)??
You can stop imagining and watch Maya and Tyler.
