a picture with some text in it, OK?)




We have witnessed in the last few weeks multiple atrocities, 

murders, beatings, by muslims offended by a short film and 

by some cartoons. Even a prize of 100,000 dollars has been 

put on the person who produced the movie so he is murdered 

and by, of all people, a government official of a muslim country.



I think it's about time fanatic muslims learn to respect human life, 

freedom of speech, tolerance, like in the west where all sorts of 

criticism and even pornographic distortions of religious leaders 

appear, are rejected or condemned, but nobody dies because 

of that.



Let's then take the two lines of text I propose to be the beginning
 
of a new Quran to be read in all mosques from Morocco to Indonesia.






I can seed for a short time only, please seed to keep alive.

Thanks.
