Most of us donΓÇÖt have the luxury of being able to linger at fresh produce markets and specialist delicatessens, followed by a few hours in the kitchen, dreaming up menus to delight our families at mealtimes. If weΓÇÖre lucky, itΓÇÖs a dash to the nearest supermarket to grab a few items for trusted but boring everyday meals. At worst, itΓÇÖs fast food, leaving your family soaked in MSG and trans fatty acids, and you full of guilt! There must be a happy middle ground. Enter Fuss-free Suppers. Super cooks Jenny Kay and Elinor Storkey show you how to create meals with the minimum of fuss and time, and which your family will love. ItΓÇÖs all in the planning and organisation. With the right tools and equipment, a well-stocked pantry (all covered in the book), and this selection of recipes, youΓÇÖll be a new person ΓÇô at least in the kitchen! Chapters include chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish, pizza and pasta, vegetarian and side dishes.
