,beaujoulais,2012-09-25T23:39Z,Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin & Samy Davies Junior once were real good music based cinema artists. Films had nearly no story but still were nice to see. Do you have some more stuff from them ?

here we are again 
I agree with you. These were cool guys.Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;ve started listening to Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra of the Rat Pack a long time ago 
My mom was a big fan of Dean Martin.( and Elvis of course). Actualy,.the first album that I ever bought was  ""Memories Are Made of This"""
