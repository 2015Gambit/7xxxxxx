,grandebruno,2012-09-30T07:10Z,Thank you nate_drake for this! Excellent! Any chance to see the Biffy Clyro show?
,nate_drake,2012-09-30T10:43Z,"@grandebruno You're most welcome. Will seed Biffy's later today, I have lots more to come (if they are not uploaded before by somebody else) but cannot seed them all at once since my upload speed is not that great."
,dawideksl,2012-09-30T11:39Z,"Hey! thanks for the upload. nate_drake, please seed rebecca ferguson and alicia keys if u can. ill be very thankful. thank You!"
,nate_drake,2012-10-01T03:17Z,"@dawideksl: You're welcome. I'll try, check back this week. I don't promise anything since I don't like either artist."
,nate_drake,2012-10-04T07:04Z,"Sorry all for misinformation, for some reason I didn't think and put 1080p but this is actually 720p, and that is the max available resolution of the show as streamed by Apple."
