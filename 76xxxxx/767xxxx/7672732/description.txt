QG 70 - Quantum Gravitation

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Using Tetryonics a complete understanding of the mechanics of Gravito-Electro-Magnetic interactions is revealed.

Facilitating the application of the Tetryonic Unified field equation for EM mass-ENERGY-Matter in motion to the mechanics of universal Gravitation.

In turn unifying Newtonian Gravity and General relativity through the quantum interactions of Tetryonic geometry [and specifically the alpha constant]

The seventieth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
