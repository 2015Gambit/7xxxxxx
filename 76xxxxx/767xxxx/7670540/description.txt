Mizuumi ryu Karate is the style created and taught by Owen Johnston, founder of Johnston Karate. The style is dedicated to the development of body, mind, and spirit. The nucleus of Mizuumi ryu Karate is formed by Heiwado Karate (the style founded by Japan International Karate Center), Boxing, and various grappling styles. (Primarily Brazilian Jiujitsu and Aikido.) This page will include all information about the style, including locations where the style is taught, and other news. The goal is not to promote Mizuumi as any kind of "best" or superlative style, but simply as our own unique approach to existing traditional martial arts.
