I have been posting on tpb for 5 years now but there's still a ton of 80s records I have not got around to rip/post. It blows your mind how much cool music was created back then amongst all the garbage we were exposed to. A blogger was damn right when he said "the '80s gave us the best and the worst". Here you are people, part 129!
