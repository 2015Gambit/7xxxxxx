Still prime candidate for ""Pirate of the Year"" award ... ٩(͡●▂◣)۶ 

Thank you for shrinking this file from 7GB to 1.6GB. It's still downloading but if it's anything like your ""Andrei Rublev"" it'll be a 10/10 for sure.

I tried to go to the forum suprbay  link you provided but my security software tells me it's an untrusted site which won't provide correct certificates, and is likely another site impersonating your site trying to redirect traffic away. What's up with that?"

Thanks dellefs0. Minor glitch with the Eng Fren subtitles. They did not transfer well. But, no sweat ""Opensubtitles"" and ""Podnapisi"" have them."
