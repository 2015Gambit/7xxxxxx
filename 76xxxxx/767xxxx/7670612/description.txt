Bawal na Halik(VCDRip)_KanorTOPSIDER

Starring:
Jay Manalo, Daniel Fernando, Glydel Mercado, Ruby Moreno, Allan Paule


ΓÇ£Bawal na HalikΓÇ¥ is a heavy-handed morality tale of how God punishes excessive sleaziness, in both men and women, by inflicting AIDS upon those who partake in too many pleasures of the flesh.
Starring Jay Manalo as a macho dancer and Glydel Mercado as a prostitute/masseuse/dancer, the film was made at the peak of the AIDS hysteria, when Filipinos were finally waking up to the fact that they too could become infected with HIV. Unfortunately, the film also sensationalizes the tragedy of people infected with the virus by highlighting the irrational prejudices of the general public.
