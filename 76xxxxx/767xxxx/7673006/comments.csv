,madnn45,2012-09-26T02:30Z,IÂ´ve downloaded the unfixed one. What are the files to replace? all of them?
,macht102,2012-09-26T02:36Z,setup.2 on the old torrent wouldnt download fully. it would get stuck at 99%
,baka18,2012-09-26T02:43Z,so now i have to download all over again??
,whatzitooya,2012-09-26T03:17Z,baka18 you dont have to just setup2
,macht102,2012-09-26T03:23Z,just have to download setup.2 if you have all the other parts already.
,rich7996,2012-09-26T03:40Z,"Finally after one day stuck at 99.9% it downloaded

,baka18,2012-09-26T04:10Z,thanks i figured that out when it downloaded in 50 seconds thanks though you are awesome. just hope it works!! also do we have to have the internet on to install it?
,jbell521,2012-09-26T05:30Z,plz seed
,Paireet44,2012-09-26T05:36Z,"Hi,

Thank you very much for the upload! I just have a question though, I noticed on the description that the only DLC that are missing are ""Late Night"" and ""Master Suite Stuff"", are they actually missing or you just forgot to mention them here? I mean, you got every single one DLC except for those...anyway, if you don't answer, I guess I'll just find out by myself when the download is done and I install it."
,baka18,2012-09-26T06:26Z,it keeps kicking me out when i try to move into a house. it says windows stopped working or something along those lines what do i do?
,baka18,2012-09-26T06:48Z,i meant the Sims 3 has stopped working
,Kaylakinz,2012-09-26T07:15Z,"i made an account just to comment, but I'm doing the download and for THIS one to fixxed it doesn't seem like it is, It's still stuck at 99.7%...."
,jadedb,2012-09-26T07:31Z,"this was really good timing, ur the bomb thanks"
,macht102,2012-09-26T08:23Z,"""Late Night"" and ""Master Suite Stuff"" are included. i forgot to mention them."
,TheSheepFarmer,2012-09-26T16:09Z,"Installing now. 

Thank you!

Now wil seed until not nececairy [:"
,valuepack,2012-09-26T17:52Z,"Dude. Please stop posting this bullshit. I thought the first torrent was working until I was stuck at 99.9 for 3 days. This ""fixed"" one downloaded quickly - install took FOREVER, but finally worked. Now, the launcher won't LAUNCH! Errors up the ass. If you aren't going to personally test these before you post them, DO NOT POST THEM!"
,jbizzle10,2012-09-26T18:28Z,"There is a problem, the launcher won't work. "
,macht102,2012-09-26T18:44Z,try running from TS3W.exe in the install dir. i have confirmed the install works on this comp and 4 others(friends/family) so far.
,macht102,2012-09-26T18:47Z,also might need to run install as administrator. some files might need administrator to be installed correctly.
,jadedb,2012-09-26T19:36Z,"i cant find the "" TS3W.exe"" file. can u tell me in detail wer to find it. and/or tell me how to run the installer as admin. wen i right click it, it does not give me the option."
,jadedb,2012-09-26T19:39Z,"scratch the admin install question, figured that out. ill post if that works. i still would like to know wer that one file is located."
,macht102,2012-09-26T19:51Z,it should be at C:Program FilesThe Sims 3 Ultimate EditionThe Sims 3GameBin   also right click and go to properties and it should be under compatability to select it as run as administrator.
,macht102,2012-09-26T19:54Z,also if TS3W.exe is not there then your antivirus might of deleted it since it is a no-cd exe.
,baka18,2012-09-26T19:54Z,TYTY!! Works like a charm for me! 
,valuepack,2012-09-26T19:59Z,"FINALLY got this stupid thing to launch. Had to update Directx and some other stuff. Seemed all good until I get to the create - a -sim part. Can't get any further than picking out clothes before the stupid game crashes. I feel like such a fool for wasting all this time trying your torrent. I DON""T BELIEVE YOU for one second that you tried this on 4 computers and it worked on all of them. Nope. Try again."
,Wilzyg,2012-09-26T21:57Z,can i chose language or there is only english?
,Qvistgaard,2012-09-26T22:23Z,Did try the things you told. But it says im missing d3dx9 ?. WTF is that ?
,Qvistgaard,2012-09-26T22:47Z,"Arrrh !, DirecktX :-).

But year, what about the languge ?, can it be changed ?"
,jadedb,2012-09-27T00:15Z,so if i turn off my antiv and re install it should work?
,macht102,2012-09-27T00:17Z,"It is english by default but you can do this.

Language change steps:
1. Go to run and type regedit
2. It will take you to the registry editor, click the down arrow on ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE""
3. Then on ""Software""
4. Then go down to ""Sims""
5. Click on ""The Sims 3""
6. See the thing that says locale? Right click on it and choose modify.
7. Change the value data to EN-us, that stands for English U.S. or any of the others
languages=en-us,fr-fr,es-es,es-mx,de-de,it-it,nl-nl,sv-se,da-dk,no-no,fi-fi,pl-pl,pt-pt,hu-hu,cs-cz,pt-br,el-gr,ru-ru,ko-kr,zh-hk,ja-jp"
,macht102,2012-09-27T00:24Z,"or you can download the language changer from here

,jadedb,2012-09-27T00:35Z,should turning the antiv off work after i reinstall it?
,elfeena,2012-09-27T18:09Z,I'm downloading at 0.2kB/s... only 2 seeders... Seed anybody? Please?

,koppen00,2012-09-28T06:42Z,"Hi. I dont have enough space on my C-drive to innstall on it. i only got like 4 GB left on my C-drive, so no change that i can install on it. But on my D-drive i got 150 GB left. Anyone knows how to ""transfer"" GB from D to C, or any other solution to my problem? Why can we choose where we wish to install it..? "
,macht102,2012-09-28T08:17Z,you can use this tool to transfer GB space from D to C.  http://www.partition-tool.com/
,fitlighter,2012-09-28T14:30Z,"Thank you!!  downloaded, install took awhile, but that was expected as if i sat and installed each one of the expansions separately would have taken longer. used the launcher shortcut that was placed on the desktop and the game started fine. played about 30 minutes no problems, saved and quit to come here to say Thanks!!!!"
,CerceTentones,2012-09-28T17:48Z,"I must admit, I'm a little new at this.  This is the only torrent I have been downloading, and I have set it to highest priority, forced a start, and set download and upload speed to unlimmitted.  I am doing nothing else with the computer except the occasional browse of the internet.  The torrent has been downloading for a good day and a half now.  Is this longer than what it should take?  If so, what should I be doing to speed things up?  I'd happily seed once I get a full download."
,mtgguy,2012-09-28T21:32Z,"Wtf? It starts out loading the (fixed) version, but then changes to the original download, which stops at 99.9, and 99.7 of the setup.2 file."
,xK3V1Nix,2012-09-28T22:03Z,"Works, thanks so much!
For anyone saying it didn't work, you're either lying, either don't know what you're doing."
,Varadar,2012-09-28T22:11Z,"It works but can't be updated, there is a new patch already (1.39) but there is no way to install it, it keeps telling me that there is no version of Sims 3 installed."
,macht102,2012-09-28T22:44Z,you cant update because TS3W.exe is a cracked exe file.
,baka18,2012-09-29T05:34Z,is it okay to update the game?
,macht102,2012-09-29T06:13Z,you can update if you get the original exe file.
,ssellers,2012-09-29T09:05Z,Help!! i'm stuck at 99.9% says it wont be done for 18 hours...
,koppen00,2012-09-29T11:30Z,The launcher doesnt work.... i just got errors! Someone knows what to do?
,koppen00,2012-09-29T11:47Z,"Hey peeps! 
I think i've fixed the problem with the non-launching game. You need to download a missing d3dx9_31.dll file. Just google it. You need to download this file and place it directly in you system32 folder. and voila - now you can probably start your game!! Mine is allready loading my town! hurray :D"
,CerceTentones,2012-09-29T17:32Z,"I will admit, the download was a bit slow for my taste (two and a half days), but once there were a few more seeders, things started getting up past the 200 kB/s range.  Very good work, will seed."
,cassarie2,2012-09-29T19:23Z,this needs seeders SO badly
,waggo111,2012-09-29T20:26Z,How do you select the install path if you've disabled it? Is there a work around? Or can you just move the maps to where you want?
,waggo111,2012-09-29T20:27Z,"And also, can you delete/uninstall expansion packs you dont want? Or is everything sorta ""stuck together""?"
,ssellers,2012-09-29T20:57Z,I still hava a problem setup 2 is stuck at 99.7 99.9% downloaded. Any ideas on what I should do?
,ssellers,2012-09-29T21:06Z,setup 2 not working stuck 99.7% total download 99.9% what should i do ?
,waggo111,2012-09-30T11:50Z,Anyone can confirm if you can move the folder after you've installed it? I dont want my games spread all over my hard drives
,waggo111,2012-09-30T12:35Z,Confirmed that moving the folder to your desired location does not work after being installed. Oh well I'm just gonna wait for someone else to put up a pack where you can actually chose where to install the game
,fiona905,2012-09-30T19:25Z,I'm having problem for the setup 4. The problem is decompressing error. What can I do?
,fiona905,2012-09-30T19:48Z,I have problem in installing the setup 4. It's about decompressing error...I don't know what's that. What can I do>
,macht102,2012-10-03T18:58Z,all you could try to do is redownload setup 4.
,macht102,2012-10-04T00:32Z,"for those wanting to update from 1.38 to 1.39
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7688576/The.Sims.3.Update.v1.39.3-HI2U
seems to work."
