IMO she should stick to Harry Potter related novels for the overwhelming support and fan base. 

The detail in the novel seems forced, and many times useless detail - just adding words to fill instead of them having an effective meaning."

,machspee,2012-09-27T14:00Z,"A lot of  you guys are downloading this because you saw J.K Rowling name on it. 

This book doesn't have any fantasy or magic elements. Its an ADULT FICTION book.

Don't have any high expectations like you had with Harry Potter books. "

That's what I was afraid of, but I'm going to give it a shot and see.  I do like her work, but HP did have too much repetition in it."

On the contrary, guys, you should expect the best of it. I, for one, do.
I've always thought Rolling was just had had a good working-out with this Harry Potter stuf (wich I have read the first book only of), practicing, drilling,  cleaning her pen at it, if you please,foะบ something much more serious. Now this first ""serious' work of he has finaly come out. Now I, again speaking for one and for myself only can possibly give it a shot and see, either she is a really of any serious authors, or her Harry Potter was just a good, the best actually in the world, advertising.
