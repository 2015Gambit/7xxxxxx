,Lynkin,2012-09-26T23:38Z,"Wow... i was reading at some websites, that CAPCOM really shipped the Xbox 360 version of the game in 2 Discs, but the second disc is not necessary for campaign gameplay or something like that, it's just for ""Localized Content"" and multi language support... anyway, thanks for the torrent !"
,reno.99999,2012-09-26T23:43Z,thanks alik0.  Looking forward to playing this.  Looking for anyone that has a good CURRENT link for RGH.  If so I would appreciate a link or any help.  Looking to RGH my banned box
,chupo28,2012-09-26T23:45Z,"I am afraid that the true Resident Evil fans will be disappointed:( I wish Capcom made an old school horror survival game instead of making an arcade third person shooter with the stupid LB button (you will see what I am talking about when you try the game)
Luckily we have got Borderlands 2 these days:)"

,sunny8872,2012-09-27T06:49Z,"FOR PC GAMERS:

Release date(s)	
PlayStation 3 & Xbox 360
October 2, 2012

Windows
TBA 2013 (Its real check steam store its 2013).

i was hoping it may come out in november or maybe december, so to see 2013 with no actual month given is pretty disheartening

The reason it is coming in 2013 is because pc version development started 2 weeks ago. If pc version development had started at the same time that console version started development then it may have been released at the same time with the console version. But we are getting the best version of the game and because of that i think it is worth waiting a little bit more."
,Lynkin,2012-09-27T06:51Z,"Yahoo... i'm just downloading the DISC 1 and it's almost finished, can't wait to try this out !! I'm playing the demo via LIVE for the 5th time already !! 20% to finish !!

PS: FOR THOSE OF YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISC 2.... YOU DON'T NEED IT TO PLAY THE GAME... IT'S JUST FOR MULTI LANGUAGE SUPPORT, EXTRA SPEECHES AND STUFF !!! JUST CLICK ON ""GET THIS TORRENT"" AND INSIDE YOUR CLIENT, BLOCK THE DOWNLOAD OF THE SECOND DISC... SO IT WILL BE FAST AND YOU WILL GET ONLY DISC 1!!!

I HOPE THIS HELPS !"
,flat123456789123456789,2012-09-27T08:30Z,"Holly Shit, how did u get it soo fast? I mean it's supposed to be released like in november! Does that mean Assassin's Creed III will also release some weeks later?"

It'll be the only RE since No. 1 way back yonder that I haven't 'S'd completely. The 'LB' thing is ridiculous and the camera horrible. If this is the way they're going to go then I'd rather play Dead Rising 2 : OTR et al."

,Damitttttt,2012-09-28T05:33Z,Ok so this always happens to me when I try to download new games I set everything to unlimited for downloading and uploading but I never seem to connect to people my upload speeds are slow and the same with my download speed.
,lRyu,2012-09-28T06:26Z,"The game loads up fine and I'm able to set up the brightness but the game freezes after the first cutscene and I'm given the disc unreadable error, what's up with that?"
,Pink_Taco,2012-09-28T07:28Z,lRyu usually due to a bad burn when you burn a disk make sure you verify it I played it for 2 hours no problems here.
,lRyu,2012-09-28T07:32Z,"@Pink Taco: Just thought of that, ticked verify disc and tried it again. After 50% of verifying I had several errors saying failed to read sector so I don't know what the hell is up with it."
,Lynkin,2012-09-28T08:41Z,"OK, since my previous comments were deleted, i'm going to post a new one (clean):

MY OWN EXPERIENCE:

1. Yes, the game is real.
2. Doesn't need disc 2 to play the campaign.
3. Burn with iHas dvd-burner if you have one or use truncate method (not 100% it will work on your console), in my case, i used truncated method and it's working very good...
4. My console: Xbox 360 Slim 250GB - Flashed with LT+3.0 running on dashboard 15574.
5. if you need any more tips from my own experience in testing truncate method for XGD3 games, e-mail me: lynkin@live.com

PS:

Graphics: 5/10
Gameplay: 4/10 (directional movements sucksssssssss)
History: 8/10 (so far... 3 hours playing)
Enemies: 6/10 (a few old zombies style and also RE4/RE5 style monsters)"
,derceto,2012-09-28T09:02Z,Likely due to cheaper discs IRyu.  I've had that problem before with Memorex discs.   I was advised back then to use Verbatim exclusively and I have with 100% results to date.   Maybe check into getting some Verbatims.  Hope you get it going soon.  Btw.  You aren't missing much.  This game is pretty bad. :(

I'm downloading now will post again later with the results. People post shit that actually helps the other users. Most people are not assholes and will appreciate it."
,lRyu,2012-09-28T18:04Z,"Thanks derceto but I have both Memorex and Verbatim. I've used two Verbatim and one Memorex disc trying to burn this torrent, so I'm stumped as to what could be the problem."

,bthanhawk022,2012-09-28T23:56Z,Been playing for about an hour now. Xkey firmware 1.26. No Problems. Good game so far. 1 more thing. People complaining bout how RE shoundnt have changed. The millenium aint new no more. If the RE series controlled like it did in '96 in 2012 the series would be dead. Im 29 and grew with the series but Im down with shit evolving. Appreciate the upload Alik0. Peace.

,Assassinprofessor,2012-09-29T13:01Z,"can someone tell me how to burn the 2nd DVD..i mean, should i use the topology just like DVD1 or the 2nd DVD  is XGD2..anyone help ? "
,reno.99999,2012-09-29T13:34Z,"@Assassinprofessor

second disc from what I read is for different packs, have not burned disc 2 myself.  If you need disc two yes burn and patch the same as you did for disc 1."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-09-29T15:40Z,"yeah, installed the 2nd disc and it consists only languages :S wtf!! why then upload 15GB instead of 8..why should we all dload the 2nd disc when it isnt necessary!!"

stop with these stupid comments, not everyone is American and we need the language pack.
Thanks for the upload!"
,kmankiller,2012-09-29T17:47Z,Game works on flashed BenQ.  Don't burn the second disk all it contains is 4 languages.  its an expansion pack you have to install on the hard drive to make the characters in the game speak a different language.  I guess it is a better alternative than subs if you don't speak English but to me its was a waist of a DVD.
,kmankiller,2012-09-29T17:51Z,Works on a flashed BenQ.  The second CD is an expansion to the game that gives you the option of making the characters in the game speak a different language.  To me this expansion was a waist of a DVD but I can see it being useful and a better alternative than subs for those who don't speak English.  IF YOU SPEAK ENGLISH DON'T BURN DISK 2.

,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-09-29T19:38Z,"One last thing, be prepared for a long boss battle in the end, thought it would never end, but it is made in different stages so it doesnt get boring, quite the opposite, it gets more and more exciting as we go forward... I love RE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, alll of them are good, but this is easy the best game for last. I think capcom wont be doing many RE games, because this one feels like they put all their money and time to make such a huge great game as a finale? I dont know, but could be. But I can say this, this is a cross between RE1+2+3 mixed with RE4+5, so there are things from all of the games here. And finally, you can move while firing!??? :D This is the best news of all for the franchise..."
