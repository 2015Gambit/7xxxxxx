,steve30x,2012-09-27T12:13Z,The only thing this update brings is two more dangerous drives. this game got boring fast. Euro Truck simulator should be a whole lot better than this game and its out on the 19th of october.
,ilektrolo,2012-09-27T23:27Z,same problem as the previews updates...it exits you to the main menu after some time
,steve30x,2012-09-29T17:03Z,""" ilektrolo :If you start with a new profile annd delete the old profile it wont exit to the main menu"
,PSP-VC,2012-09-29T18:18Z,Pfff .... you play 5 min and it's came back to the main menu
,ilektrolo,2012-09-29T21:45Z,"@steve30x yes but this is not a solution,you are losing your progress and crack is still not good-broken.after the creation of new profile game works fine but if you normaly exit the game(windows) and start again you will have problems."
