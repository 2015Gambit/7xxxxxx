As Grace's ties to Chicago's Southside mob 
intensify, Constantine sends her to meet slain 
mob boss Paul Moretti's former rival, Donte 
Amato, who's suffering from an undiagnosed 
life-threatening condition. Meanwhile, romance 
at Roosevelt Medical Center pulses when Grace 
collaborates on a heart-wrenching case with 
Dr. Robinson involving a young bride 
experiencing severe mood swings.
