Zygor Guides 4.0 is an entirely new version of our guide software built from the ground up. With any major release you may run into small bugs or errors in the software.


Instructions:
-------------------
1. Download.
2. Extract.
3. Copy extracted folders to your WoW/Interface/AddOns folder.
   - Both Horde and Alliance MoP folders are included, if you don't play both, don't worry, WoW will only load the appropriate guide.
4. Launch WoW.
5. Once you are logged in and at your character screen, click the AddOns button and make sure that ZygorGuidesViewer is checked.
6. Launch the game and enjoy.
