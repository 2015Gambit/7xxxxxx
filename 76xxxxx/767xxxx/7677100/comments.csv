,Zipgun,2012-09-27T15:25Z,The best and only batman movie imo.
,Zipgun,2012-09-27T15:30Z,Oh crap scratch that. Wrong movie the one with Micheal Keaton is the number 1 Batman and his version outshines all the rest especially George freaking Clooney?!! Whos the idiot who decided on him? He was the worst batman I compare him with the current James bond. Hence why I stopped watching 007 films since Peirce was gone. The guy the have now (dont even know his name) sucks big time. Connery was the best followed by Moore. But again Keaton's batman rules!
