"After the Storm"

After four seasons of "will they" or "won't 
they," Richard Castle and Kate Beckett 
finally gave in to their feelings for each 
other in the much anticipated Season 4 
finale. Season 5 picks up on the proverbial 
morning after, with Castle and Beckett 
facing new questions -- Was this a one-time 
fling, or are they now a couple? But before 
they find the answers, they must take on 
the forces responsible for Beckett's 
mother's murder that now threaten Kate 
Beckett's life.
