,pirateman1283,2012-09-26T17:06Z,thanks M. Why do you people like the Mp4 version?
,shallow2,2012-09-26T17:45Z,"@pirateman1283: The higher bitrate means 3-5x the picture quality. Very noticable difference imo. Also the Mp4 files search better, when jumping back and forth on wmv's with ex. vlc player the picture breaks up and skips. Much prefer MP4 :)"
