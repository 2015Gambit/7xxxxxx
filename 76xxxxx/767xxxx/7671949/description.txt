Description:300 mph winds toss ships like bathtoys as an enormous cyclone threatens the entire eastern seaboard. A lone meteorologist and petroleum engineer must battle the elements to stop the threat.A group of oil drillers off the shore of south California accidentally drills to close to the Earth’s core causing a volcano eruption. Since the eruption occurred at the bottom of the ocean, it creates one super cyclone that is going to destroy most of California. The only hope is a group of oil drillers (who do absolutely nothing but run around the oil rig), Dr. Jenna Sparks (played by Ming-Na), and Travis Verdon (played by Nicholas Turturro).
