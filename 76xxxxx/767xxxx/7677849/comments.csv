This book doesn't have any fantasy or magic elements. Its an ADULT FICTION book.

Don't have any high expectations like you had with Harry Potter books. "

,toro5,2012-09-27T21:53Z,"@machspee, I know exactly what this book is. I'm interested to read it to see just how different it is from the HP series. Why do you care why people choose to read a particular book?"
,machspee,2012-09-28T08:09Z,"@toro5 : If you know exactly what the book is, then why do you care to reply to me? Obviously you are not the person I intended the message to. Lots and lots of people have this high expectation and most of them pre ordered the book because it had the name on it. I am merely lowering down the hype. So don't be a prick, okay?"
