IF IT'S RAINING IN BRAZIL, BUY STARBUCKS

This paperback edition delivers macrotrading to a new and wider audience, identifying which economic indicators are essential to follow, how to trade profitably in times of recession or inflation, subtle signals that indicate imminent turning points in the market, and much more.
