This is a collection of back issues of Jared Taylor's magazine "American Renaissance."  These can also be found at http://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/ as can some editions which aren't available in pdf form.  "American Renaissance" is a must read for people interested in America's future in the face of the many challenges it faces today, particularly an immigration policy that suits corporations in search of cheap labor but destroys the schools and social institutions of the people that built this country.  People who want to talk about race without the politically correct blinders that hamstring most conversation on that controversial topic will find lots of interesting contend here.
