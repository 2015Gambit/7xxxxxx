But I'd like to ask something and I hope you don't mind. Next time could you pack apps for rooted mobiles separately? You provide so many apps but some users can't have rooted phones when they need their warranty so separate packs could be useful."
,StoneBoyTony,2012-09-28T00:54Z,"migotka21 yes you are right and I heard that before so now everything is in order and this package is corrected in that point of view. When the download is finish, extract the rar package, it will create separate folder called ""APPS for ROOTED Phones!!!"" in that folder are all the apps for rooted phones. Everything outside that folder are apps for normal Android Phones so as for that I create pdf file you can see the first picture on the top is that folder (the first one) that we are talking about for the rooted phones and the last one picture present all the apps inside that folder. The pdf file you can download it first is separate from the rar package so you can have a look. Just be patience I'm still seeding and I will be seeding all day. Just keep alive this torrent as possible we can. "
