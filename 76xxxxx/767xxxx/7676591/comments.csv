If by any chance when you are tracking down WATXM, you could find Untold Tales of Punisher #4 from last week as well that would be awesome. Thanks again"
,blech12345,2012-09-27T04:11Z,I'm guessing Wolvie and the X-Men is being scanned last because it's supposed to be a Doop story. Not a lotta folks likin Doop.
