'watching stupid cat video' addiction. Then I can disconnect the internet."

There's nothing wrong with a bit of porno if you don't hurt anybody. It's all just good fun!"

Either you are not an addict or you still havent realized about it. Have a look around the web how many people are having problem with the porn addiction in their personal life in their work and relationships. They want to stop so bad but they can't. Anyway if you havent even realized that its your addiction then you have no point in losing it until you do."
