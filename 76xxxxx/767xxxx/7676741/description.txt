Last Whiff of Summer Pts I  II

Frankie's plans to recreate the magic of her
own childhood summers are foiled when Mike
lets it slip that Axl is his favorite Heck
child, and Frankie tries to coax the kids
into telling them who their favorite parent
is. Meanwhile, when Frankie and Mike
discover that Axl failed English during the
past school year, they force him to make it
up in summer school, otherwise he could
jeopardize any chance of getting a college
sports scholarship after graduation Brick
takes up growing a tomato for his summer
project and Sue tries to bond with a
reluctant Mike and to get him involved in
different activities with her -- which she
plans to document in a giant scrapbook
