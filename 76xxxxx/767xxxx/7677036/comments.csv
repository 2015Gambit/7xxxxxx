,Vlvv,2012-09-27T23:43Z,"Please, stop including a .nfo with the release... it just makes ÂľTorrent create folders I don't want, so I delete them and I don't seed. This is just boring."
,VKHadron,2012-09-28T02:40Z,"Ep was awesome, sarcastabal rlz! I loled hard with Stan's father sarcasm break down.

Thanks Dibya.

P.s.: Taking out the nfo seems like a good idea. When we don't want a folder for each ep, seeding suffers."

,Revise,2012-09-28T08:40Z,I can't believe how many stupid fucks actually think their opinion of the episode is valid in the comments section for the torrent.  Get the fuck over yourselves!  You aren't going to prevent people from watching this no matter how butt-hurt you sound.
