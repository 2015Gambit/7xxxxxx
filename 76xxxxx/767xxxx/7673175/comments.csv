,ClubQBall,2012-09-26T05:03Z,"@nobody2007 - At it again, shit-for-brains???  Boy, I swear to God, you are such an arrogant dick.  Who the fuck cares if it's been uploaded before?

Say fucking ""THANK YOU"" (or not) and be about your way, you fucking ass.  You're one to fucking criticize ... half of YOUR shit is about as useless as tits on a boar hog, man.

Get the fuck outta here with that pompous, pretentious bullshit."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-26T05:05Z,"@marcelo390 - THANK YOU VERY MUCH for posting this torrent.  Pay no attention to that ass who posted that bullshit above me.  He's a know-it-all ass who likes to bully new uploaders with bullshit posts ... even though he should fucking know better.

Excellent work."
,pw1959,2012-09-26T12:01Z,"There is something about the usefulness of this torrent I do not understand.

Versions 10.0.X are available all over the TPB. 

Furthermore I have downloaded from TPB version 11.0 sometime ago. And it's working just fine.

So what is so magic about providing right now this version?

My personal conclusion is that there is no need to be rude and aggressive with some commenters who make some very valid comments."

Thank you. I agree with you.
This guy is just sick or crazy. These ""people(???)"" need this as self-affirmation."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-27T01:55Z,"@nobody2007 - No, I'm neither sick nor crazy nor anything of the sort.  What I AM is sick and tired of seeing YOU - someone who is ""allegedly"" respected enough to have earned a pink skull & crossbones from the Moderators of this site - constantly and unerringly fuck with people who post torrents that YOU find disagreeable for some vague and mysterious reason.

So, yeah, when I see an assholish comment from you, I'm going to speak my fucking mind because, quite fucking frankly, you've done EXACTLY the same motherfucking thing you rip into these new uploaders for doing.

Dude, your torrents are fucking excrement.  I used to download a LOT of your stuff ... but you post some of the same exact shit and you rip off shit form other people and claim as your own.

You're nothing more than a fraud.  A fake.  You didn't earn shit; you just fucking stole from others' efforts.  And that, asshole, is WHY I have such an issue with you.

You fuck with people who are new here ... and you're guilty of some of the same exact fucking shit.  

Now ... go fuck yourself.  TWICE.  You're an ass."
,ClubQBall,2012-09-27T01:59Z,"@pw1959 - Look at this way:

No one is compelling you to download the torrent ... so, um, why doe it REALLY matter to you how useful it is or even if it's a particular piece of software or an application that's been uploaded by one other person ... or five others, or ten others, or even a fucking hundred others?

There is NO LIMIT to what we can and cannot upload on TPB ... as long as it's malware/spyware free.  

So, as for your comment?  MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.  I wasn't speaking to you to begin with ... I was addressing that shit-for-brains fraud:  nobody2007.  Y'know, thedickhead who's drunk with power because he has a pink skull & crossbones?  Yeah, him.

So ... go on about your way and do whatever it is you do.  I don't have an issue with you and I'm not seeking to begin shit right now.  Mind your own business and handle yourself without involving me in any way."
