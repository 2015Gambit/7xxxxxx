,GSergeant,2012-09-26T17:55Z,Thank you. Can the game be played without kinect?
,C4D3N,2012-09-26T18:23Z,I'm almost positive it is Kinect only and cannot be played with the controller.
,lordofshadow23,2012-09-26T18:45Z,@GSergeant  this game can only be played with Kinect.
,GSergeant,2012-09-26T20:26Z,Oh well.. must be great game anyway!
,briebee72,2012-09-26T23:27Z,"THIS IS A KINECT ONLY GAME!!!!! you cant use a controller.  this has to be the stupidest thing microsoft has done yet. why they hell would you put one of your top franchises as a kinect only game? whats next halo will only be kinect only as well??? real gamers dont use that stupid ass kinect shit. who the hell wants to play a rpg that takes weeks to play having to run in place, jump up and down and wave your arms all over. this is f'ing stupid."
,Super-E,2012-09-27T04:30Z,"Yeah they should of made it to use controller too that is pretty dumb, PIRATES FTW!!!!"
,GSergeant,2012-09-27T19:44Z,"Microsoft.. Do you even know who you're talking about? Big one. Strong. Unbreakable. King of Earth. But! Never, EVER, king of heavens."
,Sovikos,2012-09-28T08:33Z,Is this torrent even real?  Can anyone confirm?

,Sovikos,2012-09-29T07:45Z,"Bass Fisher?  WTF... Get a name first off, dick wad.  2nd, this isn't on any .NFO or SceneRLS site, so suck my sack!"
,Karze_san,2012-09-29T23:45Z,"Im equally surprised as Sovikos, but i'll be giving it a go to find out since this is due out 10/09/12 and 10/12/12 in PAL regions!!!

Hoping for the best, thanks Noobish.

,Super-E,2012-09-30T19:03Z,Well thenoobish has uploaded alot of stuff so its pointless to question 
,Karze_san,2012-10-04T02:14Z,"Well this works & plays fine on my pal LT3.0 - well Noobish in getting it out so early. Thanks 

@Super E, by the way ""so its pointless to question"", no one likes an over-zealous fanboy >_>. People are allowed to ask when things are surprising or unusual, especially when you know nothing anything about Scene releases."
