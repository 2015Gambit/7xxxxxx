MOVIE PRODUCTION VOL.I-V


"In the movie production series, we're gonna teach you everything we did for one setup (audio, lighting, acting) and then move on to the next location. Hopefully at the end of this experience, you will feel like you've spent the week with us on the set, learning everything that we did, step by step.
By the end of the entire series, you'll probably learn just about everything that you will need to go ahead and get on the set and take charge of your creative team, your actors, your equipment, your gear, your camera, your lights, and fullfill the ideas that you had for your movie when you were just writing your script.
