If you are a teen, dating can be more important than any other aspect of life. You never tire of discussing it, reading about it, agonizing over it. "The Comlete Idiot's Guide to Dating for Teens" gives help to the dating teenager. 

 It explains how to ask for a date, and how to accept or reject one graciously. If you are already dating, it discusses how to keep a relationship going or how to end it, how to know if going steady is right for you, and how to deal with your date's family and friends.
