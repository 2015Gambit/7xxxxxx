Notes:

Digitally remastered using a custom built, Dual-DAW, nicknamed Bertha, by jashley@deadacated.com.  
Completed on January 6, 2004.

The original source has the usual flat/dry sound of Phil's boards. The mix is extremely narrow stereo with a small delay between the channels.  None of this is really surprising considering they continue to use house mixes for their recordings.

The fade between disc 2 and disc 3 was left as-is.

Hi folks;

The recent Warfield shows were such a compelling experience for me that I?d like to share them with you. To that end, we?re releasing the soundboards of all three shows for free download with the invaluable help of our friends at philzone.com and all the mirror sites.

Get a costume ready (I have mine) for the festivities at our upcoming Mardi Gras show on February 12, 2005.

Happy New Year!

- Phil

THIS SOUNDBOARD IS **FREE** THANKS TO PHIL & FRIENDS (WWW.PHILLESH.NET)
