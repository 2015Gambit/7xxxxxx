Book Description
Device drivers literally drive everything youΓÇÖre interested inΓÇôdisks, monitors, keyboards, modemsΓÇôeverything outside the computer chip and memory. And writing device drivers is one of the few areas of programming for the Linux operating system that calls for unique, Linux-specific knowledge. For years now, programmers have relied on the classic Linux Device Drivers from OΓÇÖReilly to master this critical subject. Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides all the information youΓÇÖll need to write drivers for a wide range of devices.

Over the years the book has helped countless programmers learn:

- how to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system
- how to develop and write software for new hardware under Linux
- the basics of Linux operation even if they are not expecting to write a driver

The new edition of Linux Device Driversis better than ever. The book covers all the significant changes to Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel, which simplifies many activities, and contains subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. Readers will find new chapters on important types of drivers not covered previously, such as consoles, USB drivers, and more.
