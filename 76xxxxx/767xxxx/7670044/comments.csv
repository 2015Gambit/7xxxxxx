About your 'Rush West German Atomic CD's Collection' torrent, how about you seeding it? Seems no one has it fully.
My folders are all incomplete, and it will be a lot of work to get all the newer individual ones you are posting now to get all of Rush.
What do you say?"

,cybergodsig,2012-09-26T18:14Z,I took it down because many files were MPEG.  The ones I posted individualy are legit CDDA files.  canadianice your almost at total dickhead status with jordan.
