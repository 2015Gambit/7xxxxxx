"The Key"

Joe is an accomplished architect who leads 
with his head and not his heart, especially 
in his love life. That's in stark contrast to 
his gay co-worker, Louis, who is spontaneous, 
emotional and prone to exaggeration. Both 
have found joy in their love lives: Joe is 
newly engaged to Ali, a beautiful and 
sophisticated jewelry designer; and Louis' 
companion is Wyatt, a vegan nurse who Louis 
insists is just a promotion away from 
becoming a doctor. As news of Joe's 
engagement settles, time will tell if their 
business and personal bond can adapt to the 
addition of two other important 
relationships.
