Bringing Up Baby

Jay's birthday is upon us again and, as
before, he makes it well-known that he wishes
to keep it as low key as possible, with no
grand gestures or surprises. But leave it to
the family to miss the mark yet again Phil
takes Jay on a very unconventional fishing
trip with his buddies, and Gloria struggles
with how to break the pregnancy news to him.
Meanwhile, Dylan moves into the Dunphy
household temporarily, and Mitch and Cam
decide to look into adopting a cat as they
continue to cope with their failed attempt to
adopt another child.
