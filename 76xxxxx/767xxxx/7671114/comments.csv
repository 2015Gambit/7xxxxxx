btw to be 720p it has to have 720 lines (or very close to that ~650 min) of Height.  544 means this is not even 720p.  Do not worry, there are only 10 people on TPB that actually post 720p when they advertise, and none of them are groups."

Are you retarded?

1280x720 = 720p = 1.778:1

Movies are recorded in 2.35:1 format, and the top and the bottom are cut off.

1700x720 is NOT a proper resolution, and as such most media players like XBOX 360 or PS3 will not play it.

By your logic, 1920x817 shouldn't exist, but there should be 2538x1080."
