WORKDONE:

The source video we used was pretty good but had alot of faults...there was colour issues,too dark,lots of glares and the
1080p seem to have some grps of pixels that flashed now and again,like something want wrong with the encode ??? pass lol
Anyway cleaned up the video the best we could but the brightness issue was a problem as it needed to be darker to make it a
true black but also it was too dark to start with lol
Well in the end we had to push up the contrast and brightness and then lower the intes to dull the glares down....the black isn't
a true black,but looks better now ,well too us 
Audio slightly cleaned and then remuxed back to our rip ....oh convert back to 2 channel mp3.Pointless having a 5.1 from a two channel
audio ....takes more space and all you'll get is the 2 channels coming out of 5
Anyway each to their own on that one
