You must be new to Unity so let me explain. The Unity from the site/macupdate will let you use Unity risk-free for 30 days. After the trial version has expired, you must buy a license code to continue using Unity (which happens to be $1500 for the pro version). This is where I come in an provide a crack file to relieve you of that fee. "
