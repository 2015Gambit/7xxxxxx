Henga by Juan Zanotto and Diego Navarro. Released in 1974, this black and white fantasy epic would later be the inspiration for the 1983 cult classic, Yor: The Hunter from the Future.



Big thanks for the original scanners... And always remember to support the artists! If you like it, buy it. But then again, Zanotto is dead. So, have a nice, guilt free download.
