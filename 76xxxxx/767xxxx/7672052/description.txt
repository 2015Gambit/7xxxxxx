Molecular Cell Biology presents the key concepts in cell biology and their experimental underpinnings. The authors, all world-class researchers and teachers, incorporate medically relevant examples where appropriate to help illustrate the connections between cell biology and health and human disease. As always, a hallmark of MCB is the use of experiments to engage students in the history of cell biology and the research that has contributed to the field.
