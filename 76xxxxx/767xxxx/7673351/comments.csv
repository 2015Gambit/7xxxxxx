,juggys69,2012-09-26T04:53Z," I have a author list, trying to get it onto imageshack to post it here for you guys, anyways, same as last run, which if you got part 1 brings you up to a little over 5,000 books, I managed to fit more books in a smaller space this time ( trick is to parse the cover's, they actually take up a lot of room ), so more books, less to download, enjoy ;)

,deffas,2012-09-26T05:35Z,Awesome. Do you have a link to part 1? Can't seem to find it
,deffas,2012-09-26T05:55Z,Or is it just the one that says Books College tion? 
,juggys69,2012-09-26T06:57Z," Yes, just click my name, for some reason Pirate Bay changed the name on me on part one, if you click on my name you will see both of them, first one is just ""books collection"""
,juggys69,2012-09-26T07:16Z," One thing to note, those that already DLed part 1 ( and yes part one is just "" Books Collection rar,"" name was changed during UL by mistake ) you will see a couple of authors that are in part one already, this is not a mistake, this is MORE of their stuff ;)

 ( I was missing 2 of the Shadows of the Apt books by Adrian Tchivoksky, and I only had 1 trilogy from David Gemmell in the first part, that was corrected in this installment ;)     )

 Just figured would let people know so they didn't think they were getting a re hash on those 2 author's ;)"
,Snowmyst,2012-09-26T15:25Z,"downloaded the first one, downloading this one, expecting the same great work"
