Game information :
==================
The location is Vice City, and the vibe is glamour, power and corruption...An
entirely new game set in the `80s, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City will surpass the
unprecedented gameplay, cinematic graphics and immersive audio experience that
gamers associate with Grand Theft Auto 3.
From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's
rise to the top of the criminal pile as Grand Theft Auto returns to the PC. Vice
City is a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz
to the ghetto, and is the most varied, complete and alive digital city ever
created. Combining non-linear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you
arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and are given the
opportunity to take it over as you choose.
