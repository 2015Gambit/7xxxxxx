Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the explosive Thursday, September 27 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the continuance of a bizarre TSA "freeze" compliance drill and its significance, and discussesThanksgiving anti-TSA National Opt Out Week campaign. 

He also breaks down other solutions to turn the tide against the armies of control freak-dom and break the zombification of society. 

Alex covers the latest rioting in Europe as the bankster austerity takeover accelerates. 

Alex welcomes British Author and renowned New World Order investigator David Ike to expose the large strides towards bringing about total financial collapse and public enslavement. 

Also, Amy Larson, who was arrested for writing "9/11 Truth" messages in chalk on a sidewalk, stops by to speak with Alex.
