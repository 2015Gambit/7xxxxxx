Wow! What can I say? You haven't failed to cease to amaze all of us with your excellent contributions.

Dare we ask you for the ebooks of the shortlisted authors on Booker Prize 2006?

I know that it isn't always easy to find a book in EPUB or MOBI format simply because publishers haven't released, for reasons known only to themselves, titles in electronic format. This is certainly true for titles published before 2010, when the publishing industry was still waiting for consumers' reaction to and adoption of EPUB/MOBI format.

We all know now that with the increasing popularity of IPhones, IPads, smartphones, tablets and what-have-you, more and more poeple will be reading books on these mobile devices."
