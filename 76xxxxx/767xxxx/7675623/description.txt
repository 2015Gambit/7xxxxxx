Sometimes a man can be redeemed. But not in the way he expects.

Jason Stafford is a former Wall Street hotshot who made some bad moves, paid the price with two years in prison, and is now trying to put his life back together. HeΓÇÖs unemployable, until an investment firm asks him to look into possible problems left by a junior trader who died recently in an accident. What he discovers is big ΓÇô there are problems, all right, the kind that get you killed.

But itΓÇÖs not his only concern. Stafford has another quest as well: to reclaim his five-year-old son, ΓÇ£the Kid,ΓÇ¥ from his unstable ex-wife, and then learn just what it means to make a life with him. The things Stafford discovers about himself in the process are every bit as gripping as his investigation, and when the two threads of his life come together ΓÇô the results are unforgettable.

It's been well reviewed (even without the author blurbs). Full Retail, ePub, Mobi, and AZW3 formats. There is speculation of this being a series. Sears is working on his second book.
