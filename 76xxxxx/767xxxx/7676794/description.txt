The one & only Buffalo Springfield Box Set - issued July 2001 & now out of print.
4 CDs
(MP3 224 kbs)

Contains demos & tracks from the band's studio career (1966-68).  Disc 4 holds the first two albums, "Buffalo Springfield" and "Buffalo Springfield Again," with the first album in mono as God (or the artists) intended.

Disc 4 repeats tracks from the first 3 discs.  Discs 1, 2 & 3 are the essence of this collection.  Since you're not paying for it, it's nice to have the fourth disc isn't it -- a stand-alone disc of great Buffalo Springfield albums!  A lot of consumers thought they were being ripped off when they had to pay for four discs containing only three discs of music.  But that quibble aside, this is a valuable addition to the Buffalo Springfield discography and definitely worth an investment of time & attention.
