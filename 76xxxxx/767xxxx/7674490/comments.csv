,johnharlin,2012-09-27T03:11Z,"Thank you for all your good work. I've been meaning to mention that I think there were about 2 or 3 episodes that had slight defects in them in ""The Bold and Beautiful"" in early August.
I've lost track of which dates they were except for one of them. Maybe if someone else sees this post they can also confirm if I am right. 

On Aug 10 at video time 7minutes 45 seconds a scene with a few lines went missing. Here
Liam says to Hope, ""How's this for honest....."" and then the scene jumps to another scene with Ridge. There is some scene/words missing after Liam says honest. "
