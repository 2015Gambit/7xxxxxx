"The Good Life" is the beautiful result of Monty Alexander's original take on classic pieces from Tony Bennett's extensive catalogue. It's Monty's infectious, rhythmic style containing a formidable technique that serves him unerringly without drawing undue attention away from the joyous, soulful, reverent and songful improvisations that spring from head and heart-informed fingers.
