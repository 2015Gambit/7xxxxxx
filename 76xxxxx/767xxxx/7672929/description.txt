The Persuasions have logged some serious miles driving from town to town over the years to deliver their a cappella message. To amuse themselves on the road, they sing old favorites: songs they perform in their shows, their own versions of songs of the day, and, of course, the good old stuff they've known since they were kids. This disc boasts the good stuff, including covers of Elvis Presley, Bill Withers and Otis Redding. Each selection is a song the band has known and jammed on and thought about for many years, over a lot of rough roads.
