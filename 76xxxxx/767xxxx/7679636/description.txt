One of the most prolific and influential sweet-harmony groups of the `60s and `70s, the Manhattans' recorded essential material for four separate record labels over the course of four decades. Their vast discography is a boon to soul fans but a nightmare for would-be anthologists. Thankfully, the folks at Shout Records have overcome a multitude of copyright obstacles to assemble SWEET TALKING SOUL, an expansive overview of the Manhattans' long and storied career that follows the group from their doo-wop origins to their mid-'70s heyday and beyond.
