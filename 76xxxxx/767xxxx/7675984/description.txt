Now working as a bar manager to make ends meet and maximize her time with five-year-old Maddie, sheΓÇÖs uber-prepared for every possible catastrophe ΓÇô except for the arrival of her older brother, Ben Fox. 

NOTE: Surprisingly good, fresh, funny, heartwarming writing and my beloved Lucy Punch (frankly, only reason why I even watched this Pilot).
Unfortunately, but lucky for me, it is ONLY new comedy so far I even consider as good. Other comedy series look like digesting old stuff over and over again.
