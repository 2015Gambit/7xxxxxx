,zeta90,2012-09-25T19:03Z,No. People complain when they download things that are not what they are said to be. Period.
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2012-09-25T23:10Z,"If it isn't 320kb/s then what is it? Correct me if I'm wrong but can't files of lower bit rates be converted to higher quality? While I have made Wav files (10x the size of a typical audio file) I haven't heard any difference in sound quality from them. I must not have good enough headphones, but that's why I get all my music for free anyway - can't afford to be picky. Been looking forward to this album since I heard the previews, though. So thanks."

No they cannot. That's the whole point. They can be made bigger, but they loose even more quality in the process. And our time. Download any original 128kbps one, ironically it will sound better and be much smaller."
