----|Description|
You never thought it would turn out like this, an all-out chase where youâ™re the hunted. And the hunter. Now you must get behind the wheel and risk everything to infiltrate a ruthless international crime syndicate and take them down.

The man youâ™re after is a maniac behind the wheel, and heâ™s driving like his life depends on escape, which maybe it does. Heâ™s the one with all the answers you need, you will track him down. Needless to say, that fleet of police cruisers in your rearview mirror wonâ™t make things any easier. It will take all of your experience, and every ounce of skill, to outrun the law, take down the enemy, and unlock the truth that puts an end to this chase once and for all.
