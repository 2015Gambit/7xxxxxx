This set is an uprade of ATM-0123/24 The Berkeley Concerts, now presenting the entire show in continuous uniform soundboard
quality ("Star spangled banner" & "Purple haze" were completely missing from the older versions of the soundboard tape and 
the ATM discs as well as the start of both "Foxy lady" & "Freedom") and without the distortion audible on the previous ATM 
release.

The files are numbered from 1 to 13. In order to burn a 2 cdr set tracks numbered 1-6 should be burned on disc 1 and tracks 7-13 on disc 2.

* I have been picky about posting Hendrix shows since generally the shows
seem to be more distorted than I prefer. However, this one sounds nice, 
especially when he through in 'Johnny B.Goode'.  I don't usually see him
performing this during his shows.
