Call it silly, Call it cruel, but there is something satisfying about bouncing a dog through the air with a purple car.

The game starts with Putt-Putt (the purple car) and Pep (his brown puppy) driving on to the screen with a bunch of balloons in peps mouth. Putt-putt tells his companion to hold on to the balloons tightly, which Pep immediately lets go of by barking.

In the rest of the game, you progress through different levels popping the balloons which seem to have multiplied hundreds of times. Using the mouse, you move Putt-putt across the screen, bouncing Pep on the seats or dashboard. Different balloons are introduced during the game including candy balloons which give you 50 points for each piece of candy you catch, paint-bucket balloons which change your color depending on the balloon, and question mark balloons which give you a power-up such as Fireman Pep. It also has a level builder for hours of balloon popping fun.
