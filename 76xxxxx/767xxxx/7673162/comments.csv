Then, when you run the program for the first time, make sure to click on 'exit program' for the initial serial/trial check.  It won't ask you again.
Enjoy =)"
,Vikingman1111,2012-09-27T01:26Z,"Sorry Murphy but your procedure doesn't work. I zipped the dll file into the directory, replaced the Protein dll, the program came up with choices, I picked exit, brought it up again, and the same thing repeated the choices. Isn't something else needed to make it go, or at least a key that you can provide? Thanks."
,Vikingman1111,2012-09-27T01:31Z,Murphy this doesn't work. Can't you provide a key? the dll replacement makes no difference: the request for input keeps coming up. Exit simply ends the process.
,murphy78,2012-09-27T04:47Z,"Beats me viking, it worked perfectly for me.  Try replacing the dll again, or reinstall...  This is not my crack, this is the EQUiNOX group crack, and it works perfectly for me."

Work for me!"
,fatmouse6,2012-09-28T21:12Z,"When extracting the protein.dll , make sure that you are actually putting it in the Protein subdirectory and not the main directory , otherwise it won't work . I did that accidently . Wasn't paying attention to my click and drag and drop"
