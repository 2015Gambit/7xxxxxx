Obama finishes his college studies at Columbia, where the film claims he is influenced by anti-colonialist figures. His progression into an intellectual is highlighted by a visit to Kenya. The film incorporates spoken words from Obama’s audio book, Dreams from My Father.D’Souza discusses Obama’s father, Barack Obama, Sr., and what D’Souza describes as Obama Sr.’s anti-colonialist views of the British Empire.
