Thanks for all your uploads. You are my favorite uploader!. I have noticed you hardly ever entertain requests made here if the person doesn't join your website. I joined your website for this reason and i must say the request system is highly flawed. I was told my request had already been made, yet i could not search and ""thumb up"" my request"
,soletar,2012-09-25T06:18Z,"My request = John Woo's HardBoiled and Killer


PS- I have been generously sent other TPB links, but i know your quality will be the best if and when you upload... Thanks"

Same here. The movie was always requested but I couldn't search and thumb up the request.

My request was ""The Abyss"" (1989)"

,dragonballz,2012-09-25T17:12Z,No movie below 7 (imdb rating) and below 70% (RT rating) should be uploaded.
,Ajube0476,2012-09-25T18:32Z,"Why not post the Video BitRate?
It's ok.... I would be ashamed as well."

,happynick,2012-09-26T16:29Z,Thanks! Movie is good.
,HAZE612,2012-09-28T19:31Z,What a twisted movie lolz.   Basically 6 short horror stories.
,HAZE612,2012-09-28T19:36Z,"@dragonballz  Why would you care about how idiots review movies on IMDB?  You actually trust the way most people think?  Walk around any U.S. mall and look at what people are wearing, would you take clothing reviews from them too?  Since most of them are obese would you take food reviews from them as well?  Be your own critic.  FYI Rottentomatoes is a much better sight if you are into movie reviews."
,sarcastos,2012-09-29T11:19Z,"Almost 1300 seeders, thats a lot of disappointment in a terrible movie."
