,Scorpiion4984,2012-09-28T15:32Z,I was just watching this on my PS3 via stream from the PC and about 10minutes in a message came up saying that the sound was being muted as this movie was not authorized to be played on this device. Please advise?
,setzerfoxclaw,2012-09-28T19:08Z,"Scorpiion - Thats the Cinevia protection, through your PS3 there is NO workaround, if you have a HD TV with USB Ports, i recommend investing in a nice external harddrive.  I just throw my movies on there, plug into the TV and Viola.  (Warning, doesnt work on all tv's. Check your TV's manuel to see if it supports video playback and make sure it supports AVI format)"

,Scorpiion4984,2012-10-03T13:11Z,@setzerfoxclaw Yeah thanks. I ended up doing that throught the TV and it worked fine. Thanks anyway
