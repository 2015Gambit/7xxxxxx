The Conch shell which is blown to signal the beginning of the Founder's Day Festival has been stolen, and Luther's Uncle Blenny is blamed because he is the 'Grand Exalted Keeper of the Conch.' Freddi and Luther search for the real thief to clear Uncle Blenny's name and prove that he did not steal the conch. They search and investigate the suspicious characters to find out who really did it.
