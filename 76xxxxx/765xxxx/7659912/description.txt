Raw Fiddle~2-CD (Rounder) [320KB] {MKOP}

Raw Fiddle is the type of compilation a collector like Harry Smith would've gotten excited about. Primarily consisting of old-time fiddle recordings from the '20s and '30s, this two-disc set exceeds in both scope and scale. Of course, anyone worth his or her crossbow will know that Fiddlin' John Carson's version of "Arkansas Traveler" from 1924 was the first recording of a string band in the United States. There are old minstrel tunes ("Turkey Buzzard Blues"), reels ("Rocky Road to Dublin"), and blues ("C.C. Rider"). But that's just for starters. After lots of fine American tunes on the first disc (The Domestic Front), Raw Fiddle turns to the international scene (The International Intrigue). (It should be noted that although international in flavor, many of these pieces were recorded in the United States.)
