Is that ""The Bavarian Crisis""?"
[V],azizex666,2012-09-21T02:44Z,Ring of fire - The Bavarian Crisis?
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-21T19:36Z,No it is not The Bavarian Crisis. It is just plain Ring of Fire III. No other title or subtitle. Published a month or two ago.
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-23T05:24Z,Anyone have the audiobook for Midst Toil and Tribulation? Please upload if so.
