Shouldn't DVD quality be down at 7, definitely not right next to bluray.

1080p
720p
480p
480i  -  I believe this is dvd quality"
,freeegatee,2012-09-19T13:58Z,Thanks much for the ups.
,Frank525,2012-09-19T20:24Z,"BreezeTDK,

There is a difference between quality and resolution. I have seen horrible quality cams that were 720p. I have also watched beautiful rips that were sub 420i. Any system to rate the video quality with a single numerical score has to take into consideration a ton of factors: compression, resolution, bit rate, camera focus, cropping, people in the frame, color preservation, detail retention, continuity.....

That is if you want to be exact. Your brain can make an educated guess at the score by simply asking itself: ""does it look good?""

My brain says:

V:10
A:10

Also, dvd is only 420i when displayed on an old analog player/tv. The actual resolution can be anywhere between  720p and 352x240."

And for those bitching about DVD being 9 and Bluray being 10, what quality exists between the two? Literally you have DVD, and then Bluray. Custom HD bitrates like what you'd find on iTunes etc aren't a good unit of measure, since you'll never see them on a torrent thanks to DRM. 
Honestly a scale of 1-5 would be more accurate anyway. "
