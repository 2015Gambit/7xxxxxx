The most complete Android system suite: monitor and record all activities, backup and restore *any* applications, extended task killer, CPU SD and memory controls, logcat reader, terminal emulator, widgets and notifications, all in one highly optimized app!

WARNING: Requires WIFI, BT, PHONE and GPS permissions to record phone states. App checked with Privacy Inspector!

By far the lowest consumption monitoring app! Check web-site for app consumption!

You can add shortcuts to your home screen for any of the below features/screens!

Task Manager: (can be set as main UI, see options)

    Filter user/system/kernel processes and exclusion list
    Shows cpu load/frequency, memory/internal/sd usage
    Sort processes by cpu times, start time, memory or by name
    Kill non manually excluded apps automatically
    Shows detailed information about running apps and processes
    Open app system settings
    Read app logcat
    Manually kill running apps

CPU Manager (rooted phones):

    Tweak CPU governor + frequencies during screen-off, on-call
    Tweak CPU voltage (when available on custom Kernel)
    Set CPU settings on boot
    Uses OC/deamon when available and can disable it

What's in this version : (Updated : Sep 18, 2012)

    Add support for Syiah S3 v1.6 beta kernel
    App booster no longer requires busybox

    Many bug fixes
