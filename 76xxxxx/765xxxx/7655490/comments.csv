,nexlex123,2012-09-21T09:16Z,gotta love the microscopic pics for screenshots.....lol
,spifkitten99,2012-09-21T13:28Z,"Unwatchable.

It's cropped to 4:3.
Low framerate.
Lots of compression artifacts.

Completely shit. Whoever ripped this, just give up. You don't have the skills."

,Pareto89,2012-09-23T15:18Z,It is 4:3 not very good!
,EliteBeast,2012-09-25T11:02Z,What 3rd world moron ripped this in 4:3 format? Epic FAIL
,e2a0s2t,2012-10-03T22:07Z,"The 4:3 sucks but as this is a character driven comedy it doesn't cut off anything too important.
