,solutioN-Ghost,2012-09-21T11:31Z,"solutioN for PES 2013 to crash in playing Exhibition or other matches. 
NOTE :- This is for Windows Vista/7

First you must have the PESEdit 2013 Patch 1.0. Follow :-

1. Google ""PESEdit 2013 Patch 1.0"" and click the 3rd option which states ""PESEdit.com 2013 Patch 1.0 - Released! #20/09/12""

2. Download all the three parts and Install them.

3. Open PES 2013 folder and open ""kitserver13"" folder and open config.exe as ADMINISTRATOR

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84575.jpg

Follow these settings :

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84576.jpg

Finally, SAVE.

4. Now open manager.exe as ADMINISTRATOR and click Attach. Usually it is automatically attached but just in case like mine not yet attached

NOTE: Before attaching, right-click pes2013.exe, Properties, untick Read-only.

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84577.jpg

5. Now right-click pes2013.exe and click Properties and follow those steps from the image. Usually no need but just in case. (It is either Windows Service Pack 2 or 3 and tick ""Run this program as an administrator"")

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84578.jpg

6. You're done! Now run the game and Play Exhibition Match, it should work fine. Proof :-

even with installing i had issues, i mounted image with daemon>it started installing but on 1/5 it stopped and asked me to put in cd1??? so i canceled installation and started new one ok this time it finished installing, then problem with crack... antivirus avg said it's win/heur... i went in avg to do it like exception now i could crack it, ok finally i clicked to play it started but avg pop out saying it's ibp virus(or something like that)ok i thought no problem cause it started loading game when i pressed allow but loading never stops(blank screen with loading circle down left)

now solution: i uninstalled game, TEMPORARILY DISABLED AVG and mounted game with power dvd iso(i don't know if it matters if it's not daemon tools) didn't have any problem with installing, i could crack the game because antivirus was turned off and started game normally, played exhbition match!!! after that i exited game turned on avg it immeadietly poped out that crack is virus, i made crack file as exception in avg settings, and started game again now it again pop out saying it's ibp virus(or something like that) i pressed allow and it started game normally!!!! 
so i think antivirus is problem... in short: disable it during installation, cracking and during first game starting...."

NOTE :- This is for Windows Vista/7

First you must have the PESEdit 2013 Patch 1.0. Follow :-

1. Download, extract and install: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7656829/PESEdit.com_2013_-_Patch_1.0

Follow these settings :

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84576.jpg

Finally, SAVE. (YOU CAN USE HIGHER RESOLUTION AND OPT FOR ""HIGH"" instead of medium if u have a good enough graphics card. I am using the res: 1366x768 on my dell xps)

4. Now open manager.exe as ADMINISTRATOR and click Attach. Usually it is automatically attached but just in case like mine not yet attached

NOTE: Before attaching, right-click pes2013.exe, Properties, untick Read-only.

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84577.jpg

5. Now right-click pes2013.exe and click Properties and follow those steps from the image. Usually no need but just in case. (It is either Windows Service Pack 2 or 3 and tick ""Run this program as an administrator"")

http://www.postimg.com/image/85000/photo-84578.jpg

6. You're done! Now run the game and Play Exhibition Match, it should work fine. Proof :-
