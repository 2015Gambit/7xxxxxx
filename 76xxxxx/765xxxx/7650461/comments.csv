This is the most BAD Audio Quality i Ever See.
Re-Upload this movie and Fix The Audio bitrate.

And, BTW, I'm listening on a desktop with Harmon Kardon Soundsticks 3, so, speaker systems don't get much better unless you spend a thousand dollars or whatever, if I were listening on stupid tinny little laptop speakers i wouldn't dream of commenting about this.

Personally I'll wait for a future different 1080p upload of this, hopefully."
