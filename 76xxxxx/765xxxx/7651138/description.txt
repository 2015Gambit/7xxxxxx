GPS-based speedometer that is more accurate than the one in your car.

* Speed warning
You can set speed limits for three different types of roads, so when you go over a visual alert or sound will notify you.

* GPX track export
Enables you to save your current track to SD card or email it to someone. GPX format is supported by many applications.
