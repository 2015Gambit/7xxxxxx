If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

The sequel of PewPew is there!
PewPew 2 is the best multidirectional shoot them up on Android.
Expect retro graphics, megatons of enemies, and a frame rate achieved by no other game (except PewPew).

There are seven game modes, a campaign with 3 levels of difficulties so even the weakes... *AHEM*
So even the strongest of you will have some challenge!

And then there are the new un-lockable ships and the new music (downloadable for free at http://onurmusic.com/pewpewost/).

Features:

    a deep story with drama, romance, and mystery.
    crops to grow and birds to throw, to keep in touch with nature.
    private information sharing with several companies, because we *care* about you.
    targeted advertising, so that you aren't disturbed by useless ads.

Wait. That was a list of what's not included, here we go:

    frames per seconds (a LOT)
    8 games modes (2 of which must be unlocked)
    8 unlockable ships with offensive defense (bullets shot in every direction when hit).
    a campaign, with 3 level of difficulties and boss fights
    online scores, with replays
    awesome music
    XPERIA PLAY Optimized

Notes:

    On older devices kill as many background app you can, this can considerably increase the smoothness.
    Seriously, kill them all.
    On some devices (such as the Nexus One) the touch screen has trouble handling touches on the same horizontal or vertical axis. That is why by default the joysticks are in diagonal. You can try moving the joysticks to the bottom using the settings menu, but it might result in poor controls.

What's in this version : (Updated : Sep 17, 2012 )

    Xperia Play hack to use the right buttons removed as it was causing too much problems. That means that:
    The back button should now correctly work for everybody.
    Sound effects (for Android 2.3 and up) ! You have to enable them in the settings menu if you are updating PewPew.
    ICS support.
    Removed the on-screen button to quit/pause.
    Should now work on all the CPUs (ARM/Mips/x86).

Required Android O/S : 2.1+
