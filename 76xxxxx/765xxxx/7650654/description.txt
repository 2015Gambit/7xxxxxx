Cosmic Gate @Ekwador, Manieczki 2003 (Classic) Provided by (( Arco van Saint ))

Please be aware that i've completely done nothing! this set has been given to me by (Arco van Saint) a splendid friend of mine, also a great DJ, he split and got the set! all credits go to him :)

This is a classic set by Cosmic Gate in 2003, using vinyls and in poland's known club (Ekwador in Manieczki) Enjoy it :)

P.S: sorry for not having a tracklist, that's how i got it, but trust me it's worth the download :D cheers
