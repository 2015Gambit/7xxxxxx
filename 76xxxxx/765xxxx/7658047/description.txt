New York Street Games is a 2010 documentary film directed by Matt Levy about children's games played by kids in New York City for centuries.[1] The games are fondly remembered by people who grew up in the city. Current and historical documentary footage shows children playing these games.[2] The story is brought to the present with discussions of the current role of street games and opinions as to what kids lose by not having the freedom to play without adult supervision, most importantly the social skills developed when kids could play in the streets.
