LOVE - Love Story (1966-1972)
A Rhino Anthology
2 CDs

Excellent compilation of Love's very best tracks, including the complete Forever Changes LP (spread across two CDs, with Side A at the end of Disc 1, Side B at the beginning of Disc 2).  The version of Forever Changes in this torrent is the remastered 2008 Collector's Edition, which is far superior to the version included on the original Love Story.  Since Rhino allowed this set to go out of print, I don't mind working improvements upon it.  Enjoy responsibly, Lovers!
