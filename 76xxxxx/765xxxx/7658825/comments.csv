,arrr_a_pirate,2012-09-28T18:28Z,"@rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Spoiler!!!

 bruce willis kills the child - absorbs the soul over a 5 minute & in my opinion heavily overacted display of what looked like bruce willis ""jizzing in his pants"" while he absorbed the childs pure soul.
He then turns into a ball of blue light & the scene ends & the credits roll.
If you watch till the credits finish...
The ball appears in a brightly lit white room with nothing in it but a chair...and who is sitting on that chair?
yep...fucking morgan freeman...
the camera angle changes to show both the ball of light & freeman in the shot - freeman said ""Welcome to heaven Detective Mclain""...

bruce willis comes rolling out of the ball wearing nothing his underpants & a torn wife beater, brandishing 2 pistols screaming ""yiippiekiayemotherfucker"" as he unleashes an amount of ammunition one would think impossible from the 6 bullet capacity of most 6 shooters...
the final shot is of freemans ""aka god"" face with a shocked expression before his face is riddled with poor cgi generated bullet holes which spell out words...words that read...
DIE HARD XXXV - DIEHARD, WITH A MESSAGE, A MESSAGE FOR GOD.

sorry for the spoiler folks.

Good upload extreme 10/10 (based on filesize & ripping/encode)
arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
