Overview: Pro Version is AD-FREE!! CheckIn4Me allows users to check-in on multiple location-based services (such as Facebook, Foursquare, and/or Gowalla) via one application.

CheckIn4Me also performs cross-service merging of locations, allowing users to check-in to the same place on multiple services via one button click. Note: in order to use CheckIn4Me, users must have active accounts on the services they wish to connect (ie: Facbeook, Foursquare, Gowalla, etc.). Connections to these sites are made through the OAuth protocol.
