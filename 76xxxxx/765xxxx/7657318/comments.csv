,DTake2012,2012-09-24T20:03Z,Slightly out of sync for me
,Collusion101,2012-09-24T22:21Z,"damn yea i see it very small,  I can fix it from now on, this is only my 2nd rip i have put out"
[T],theburningbush,2012-09-28T08:05Z,"Thank you! The out-of-sync was no biggie; I just hit the ""J"" key in VLC until I got to -350 ms.

A suggestion: it would easier for those of us searching if you'd make the torrent name conform to standards, e.g., ""S03E01,"" not ""S03 E01."" Thanks.

Looking forward to the final two eps of this season, 27-Sep and 04-Oct..."
,asdfkjjj,2012-09-30T17:42Z,"I gotta ask,  why only the news skit and not the entire SNL show? (which no one seems to be upping this morning)"

1. You're confusing SNL with SNL Weekend Update Thursday; they're two different programs.
2. There was no new SNL for 29/Sep/12; SNL S38E03 will be broadcast 06/Oct/12.

I'm looking forward to someone ULing the 27/Sep/12 ep of SNL Weekend Update Thursday."
