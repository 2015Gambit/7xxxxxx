The only things that really make a cam unwatchable imo are noticeable flicker in the video, or audio where you can't understand what they're saying.  Thx."
,debuggest,2012-09-20T08:31Z,download the sample in the torrent :)
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-20T21:07Z,Yup.... didn't notice that before. I had looked at another release that did not include a sample (Tode's?)

,snowdog1,2012-09-29T08:41Z,"For D.Robo, go to Get This Torrent, when d/l registers on your Torrent (I use utorrent) right click on Files, highlight everything but sample and Don't Download. When d/l check the sample. Keep up the good work .BONE, appreciated"
