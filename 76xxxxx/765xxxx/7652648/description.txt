NOTES:

Ok heres the V2 we said ......this time using matines 720p.
First cleaned the video up changing the colours,brightness,contrast,had to use a smoother and then
finally gave it some life back.
Now colours does change again but not as bad as possession did ....so tried to find a nice medium.
Audio was good but in quiet parts there was a fair bit of noise ....so dropped in AA lowered the EQ bands that
needed to be lowered....lowered thr DB's as it was way too powerful and then converted to mp3 and remuxed.

Enjoy ......oh had a chuckle at the start of the audio,you'll see lmfao .
