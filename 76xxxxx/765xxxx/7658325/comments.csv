,RayCort,2012-09-21T14:54Z,"There were 7 seeders when I stopped seeding in the afternoon, then I noticed comments that ep 68 was stuck at 65%. Dang Hit and Run Leechers that refuse to help seed. Please Seed, so others can download this excellent show."
,gdellave,2012-09-21T23:25Z,"Thank you RayCort for re-uploading episode 68. Most people would not have bothered. 

I don't know what happened because there were about 10 seeds but none of them were connected when I was trying to download it... go figure.

Thanks again."
