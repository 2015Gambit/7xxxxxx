,ROCKnTIME,2012-09-20T20:21Z,"Nothing against Saketh..This activator only changes files and manipulates your registry into making your computer appear to be activated, but you are not truly activated. If you open the command prompt as admin and enter ""sfc /scannow"" you will see that the files have been replaced and after repair and reboot you are no longer activated.. If this truly activated your computer it would and will remain activated after repair and reboot. "
,undermaker,2012-09-20T20:37Z,there is NOT working activation method anywhere...yet.....this activator not truly activate windows 8....be patient peoples and wait daz-activator...thank you. :)
,Jovica007,2012-09-20T22:08Z,"Why you upload such a crap when it's not fully working? Just a make up to look like it's activated??? C'mon, are you serious? Omg..."
,ROCKnTIME,2012-09-20T22:46Z,@Jovica007.. I'm sure Saketh didn't know it was fake and had good intentions. This Korean activator has been making its way around the net and will be re-posted here again by someone else before the weekends over.. 
,daym0ss,2012-09-20T22:59Z,Crap its not working. 
,Jan-Bertil,2012-09-20T23:28Z,"Yes, of course it will. Kids will be kids...."
,topjimmy68,2012-09-21T07:19Z,"Ah, hacktivators that really turn your OS into a frankenbuild.  Operating systems can't be ""cracked"" in the same manner as video games, unless you don't plan on truly using the OS as intended.  Do you want to be constricted into a finite box?"
,RatVanTot,2012-09-21T09:13Z,KJ is a fake activation.
,l0ad3daka,2012-09-21T15:50Z,Fucked up activation

,Humpie,2012-09-22T02:47Z,"Been activated for about a week now with no issues, I guess it's hit or miss for people. You can download apps from the store that wont matter the app store does not check for activation, it just offers a service. "
,xtraB,2012-09-22T12:57Z,WORKS  !!!!!!
,xtraB,2012-09-22T13:04Z,"FOR THOSE WHO COMPLAINT,, GO BUY AN ACTIVATION KEY and shut the F*** Up, this is a good activator for now,better than other bulls***t around that doesnt even work, at least this will keep you okay until something new come up..other than that, shut the hell up.."

,silverblue74,2012-09-25T22:07Z,"I have just succeed to permanently activate Windows 8 Pro, build 9200 !!

Works great!


I have this release: ""MICROSOFT.WINDOWS.8.PROFESSIONAL.RTM.X64.ENGLISH.DVD-WZT"""
,Naraku77,2012-09-26T07:53Z,"To be perfectly honest, why should anyone care if it's real at this point.  If you would run a Windows OS (especially a Windows like this) in anything other than a VM, instead of giving it 6 months to get the serious bugs worked out, that's your problem.  Since I don't mind reformatting a VM if it gets screwed up, whether this is genuine or not is completely irrelevant to me.  If the nag goes away for now, it's good enough.

Actually, I have no intentions of ever running 8 in anything other than a VM.  It's become a phone OS just like Ubuntu.  Those never work well on PCs.  I've always used the Kubuntu and Lubuntu variants, and never really liked Gnome, so, I can't say that one really had any effect on me either.  But when they stop supporting 7, I'm probably going to make my main OS Kubuntu for good.

I mean, sure, I'm going to throw Emerge Desktop on this within the first five minutes of installing it and kick the new explorer.exe and all that Metro crap to the curb anyway.  So it's going to look and work just like my 7 (and my XP), but still, it's the principle of the thing.  The fact that they really thought people would like that ""refrigerator cluttered with magnets"" look has me questioning the soundness of their judgement and logic."
,treedude,2012-09-26T19:25Z,"You can see my screenshot in a previous post.
But you can get a Start Menu in Windows 8, third party.

It won't come up in normal google search.

www.win8china.com/windows8master/

You can't find WinStart 1.01 Anywhere else except that install package.

Once installed right click the start menu press L to open the language menu and set the English.

Believe me I tried other Start Menus, I've seen some ones with funky menus buttons that don't work, wrong resolutions. This one seems to be the best working now.

,treedude,2012-09-26T19:26Z,Use Default Settings to install.
,treedude,2012-09-27T02:28Z,"I used to hate Windows 8 for a long time, games wouldn't go fullscreen Metro always got in my way, everything is hidden and only select shortcut keys reveal things.

I got a start menu now it's not that bad, it's like having a desktop and a secondary menu.

You can have themes on the Metro part of Windows, you can make passcodes with picture swipes, pins, or password I believe they had a 3x3 square combo before but removed it for some reason -_-.

For 15 dollars Windows 8 is worth it.

Have you tried the ""Start Listening"" Feature of Windows 8, it's pretty cool control your computer just from the mic.
You can type essays and go to address links via ""go to address"".
""switch to Word"" some of the features are pretty nifty.

But I doubt Windows 8 would ever be expensive this is a barely an upgrade. Seems like something Microsoft would put in a service pack.

They have an Microsoft Store with fun features most are free. There is a map app, paint app, Ebay app and a mail app.

Mail App loads way faster than browsers.
Internet Explorer 10 blows on the Metro menu tho, really inconvenient without real menus."
,frosky,2012-10-04T00:14Z,"It worked, but I needed a real serial number in the beginning of installation.

Now I have a Windows 8 Core, RTM - retail version, build 9200. This is a clean install.

Much later, I accidently executed some kind of automatic repair for the whole windows system. I received a notification every time I rebooted that I needed to activate windows. When I clicked the link, it led to an empty page that said ""Outdated link."" I repeated the crack uninstall/install two times and rebooted. I did not see any effect. I forgot about the issue for awhile, when I suddenly realized that the message did not repeat. 

This crack tool is an amazing piece of programming. It has many different options, tweaks, programs....

Bravo!"
