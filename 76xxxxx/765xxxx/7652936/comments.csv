,traypalazax,2012-10-04T06:22Z,"Truely the same great work you've 
ever done. Fast loading. If you need 
more Gold keys, just change the log

( Borderlands 2>DLC>POPremierclub>Lic>WillowDLC>

[GoldenKeys]

+SourceId=253

+NumKeys=999



also for multi char accounts,
 when you run out of keys just 
change log back



[GoldenKeys]

+SourceId=254

+NumKeys=999



Notice the 254  

(just change that number back and forth 254 to 253 to 254.
 Every time you do you should have a new sum of keys,
( over 200 )
