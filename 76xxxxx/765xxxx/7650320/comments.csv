,MTeo567,2012-09-18T21:53Z,nothing about this skidrow release on orly
[T],azaq318,2012-09-18T22:03Z,so what? Game works fine.
[T],azaq318,2012-09-18T22:04Z,Crack from (DCCentR / SKIDROW)
,GObonzo,2012-09-18T22:54Z,so you've included both cracks (DCCentR / SKIDROW) or you just have no idea where these files originated and are posting whatever crap was labeled on wherever you dug it up?
,skatrpro1987,2012-09-18T23:20Z,"I've read around and found more then one. Most of them being 1.4GB. What makes this so much smaller?

Also I don't doubt that it is real. Just curious."
,skatrpro1987,2012-09-18T23:22Z,GObonzo Why do you ask dumb questions? You nee d to look into skid a litter more before you speak.
[T],azaq318,2012-09-18T23:32Z,"skatrpro1987
Fils just compressed. The game i have tested myself."
,D4M333,2012-09-18T23:34Z,"It's legit people, I didn't DL this but a 1.4GB version, this works too."
,Squa7ch2112,2012-09-18T23:41Z,These screenshots are from the Steam Store page...why not post screenshots from the game after installing it yourself?
,6patera9,2012-09-19T00:00Z,Thanks man. Love this blast from the past.
,chrede2750,2012-09-19T00:55Z,"Works fine! 

1: download this file 
2: install via. Setup 
3: play from diskop "
,PirateEm,2012-09-19T01:16Z,"That was fast.

I normally pay for Steam games but considering how terrible of a port this is (No graphic settings or online multiplayer), I decided to go with the pirate approach.

Game works as good as it would on Steam.
Thanks :)"
,metalyger,2012-09-19T02:15Z,"This is 100% legit, plus the pink skull & crossbones next to the uploader's name means this guy is the real deal. It's compressed for faster downloading. It's a quick install and you just start up the game. The game itself is pretty good, very bare bones in options like no graphics settings but it's fun to see the classic levels remade in such detail."
,SiN-R,2012-09-19T02:45Z,"Legit!, and MANY THANKS for compressing the installer!! "
,Aerionix,2012-09-19T02:56Z,"Works fine, no cracking required.  Have downloaded and played THIS version from THIS user, and played until the end of 2nd mission, with no problems to speak of.  Haters gonna hate, simple as that.  "
,PirateEm,2012-09-19T06:01Z,"Game was recently patched.

The version uploaded here has problems with save files breaking.

Not sure if we can get the patch in a separate torrent."
