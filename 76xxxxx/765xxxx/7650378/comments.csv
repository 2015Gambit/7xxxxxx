Not interested in emorage as feedback."

I'm sorry we don't all have the most recent entertainment setups so why don't you just take two seconds and find a different file type. AVIs aren't exactly common anymore... it won't take you long to find something else.

And @Scorpicore, thank you for the AVI. Some of us still appreciate it."

I myself prefer .avi extensions, since Im too lazy to burn things onto a dvd. I just link the PC with the tv and stereo."
