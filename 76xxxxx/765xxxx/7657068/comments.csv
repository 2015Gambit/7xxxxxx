,hulivar,2012-09-21T18:19Z,"hm...I guess I just assumed you knew about DC++ mdusanjay?

if you don't well...go find out heh.  When your download did not work I just went and got it from there.  Using DC++ you can get any comic in existence...well any comic that has ever been scanned rather heh."

,gig0l0,2012-09-22T15:12Z,"Hey hulivar why don't you share it then?
"
,hulivar,2012-09-22T20:12Z,"good question gigolo.  Tbh I wrote out a huge wall of text telling people what DC++ was and how to use it...I guess it was too long of a comment and it would not let me post it :(

I know people don't care much about the copyright for comics but I don't use a vpn and I don't hide my connection so uploading is out of the question.  I've already had super bad luck with copyright assholes in my time, so I'm not iso more lol.

Anyway google DC++ gig0l0 and install it.  Then register to the comic book hubs, it's easy as shit.  I'd rather educate people about this, then they can get any comic they want if a situation like this arises again.  If your too lazy, then that's on you.  The Copyright trolls don't regulate DC++ anymore that is why it's so great to use, and especially for comics because they are such small file sizes.

If anyone wants an ""idiot proof"" guide to install and use DC++ for comics and everything else just let me know and give me your email or something.  I have 2 terabytes of comics from DC++...quite the collection heh.  

But ya sorry, I don't upload torrents anymore because I got bent over by the copyright trolls.  I suppose I could use a free VPN to upload torrents...the connections are real slow though and it takes forever :(

Anyway gig0l0 let me know if you want DC++"
,chistrix,2012-09-23T05:56Z,hulivar: Can you suggest some comic hub?
,moonieyam,2012-09-24T15:06Z,"@SplhcbPrime thanks! i already got it. haha
@hulivar any specific comic hubs you can suggest? i can't seem to download anything from dc++ lol."
,hulivar,2012-09-24T22:50Z,Yesterday I tried to post a comment with the hub names but it would not let me
,hulivar,2012-09-24T22:53Z,"I get a database error when I try to enter a hub name?  Makes no sense.  With it this comment won't post, without it, it will...it's just words with a few periods"
,hulivar,2012-09-24T22:57Z,"god this website sucks...maybe it's firefox screwing me I don't know but I already posted a comment explaining that it would not let me post hub names for some ungodly reason and it got erased some how.  The hub names have a few periods in them kind of like a website, so maybe that's the reason I get a database error when trying to post, I have no fucking idea.  If you want to leave your email or another website where you can read the comment I will write them down there."
,moonieyam,2012-09-25T03:22Z,oh please do. just add @gmail.com after my username
