Not that you want to use it on window XP lol..."
,DarkJediLV,2012-09-21T17:02Z,"does it include fade, and is Dayz mp compatible?"
,KilE69,2012-09-22T05:11Z,"What is fade?
And I dont think multiplayer is possible but with tunngle or hamachi I believe it is. But if ur wanting to host a server it is abit tricky with setting up a database, Only single player lets you save your progress."
,KilE69,2012-09-22T05:22Z,"You can play it lan, it will work, but I think you wont be able to play multiplayer online with other people because it is a cracked version and would say you need a valid CD key, but I could be wrong, you might be able to join non-BattlEye servers. and I have seen servers that dont require a CD key. so multiplayer might just be possible for this."

It operates by detecting if a game has been pirated, and initially allows the player to use the game normally. It then gradually degrades certain game features over a time, eventually rendering it unplayable."

,fire3k,2012-09-22T20:53Z,"When FADE is activated, reduced accuracy of some weapons, reduced weapon performance, increased enemy hit endurance and increased player injuries.
. If someone tries using an illegal version in which an attempt was made to remove or disable the FADE copy protection, games such as Operation Flash point might easily exhibit signs of instability. Removing copy protection includes changing program code in many various areas, which leads to increased application instability. Many illegal versions are known to contain such instabilities, causing the game to crash during various game-play events."

,KilE69,2012-09-23T08:52Z,"In all of installing Arma 2 OA + Arma 2 and playing it with the sandbox mode, multiplayer, or single player or playing DayZ, I had no problems with the game degrade. or anything that you have just said, I have not noticed any problems or 'Fade' with it, Neither did it have any negitive effects playing it on Windows XP. So if that answers your question I have not found any problems with it"
,KilE69,2012-09-23T08:55Z,Nor did it have any problem with playing on window 7.
