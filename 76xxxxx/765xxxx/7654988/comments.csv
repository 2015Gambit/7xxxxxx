,moccor,2012-09-20T21:54Z,is there any way to have that installer in a different language? i have no idea what any of it means
,moccor,2012-09-20T22:41Z,"do not download and install, it has a virus. piece of shit. its gonna delete your system restore points aswell"
,ian2035,2012-09-21T06:35Z,"moccor, so why is it then, that out of the 66 people that have downloaded this, you're the only one to complain? I've also downloaded this and installed it and trust me, there is no virus or malware in it. If you have a virus that ""deletes your restore points as well"", that did not come from this game. I say good day sir."
