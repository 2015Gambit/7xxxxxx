In the new version of O&O Defrag, you can now see what the program does for your system thanks to graphics and statistics, which give you a before-and-after Defrag contrast

The revised and improved algorithms for defragmentation mean that O&O Defrag 16 packs stored file fragments even faster together, and support for defragmentation of blocked files under O&O Defrag 16 is better than ever before. The SSD Optimization by TRIM has also been enhanced and now supports even more manufacturers.
