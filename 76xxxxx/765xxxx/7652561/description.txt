Requirements: Android 3.2+
Overview: Importatnt: This application is a locked application intended for our Kickstarter backers and pre-order customers ONLY.

You can set up multiple Home Screens with your own layout of widgets and apps, giving you the most relevant information that you want, when you want it. So whenever you unlock your device, you are presented with the Home Screen that is immediately valuable to you. Chameleon Home Screens can be set up based on GPS locations, WiFi networks and time ranges, allowing you to define which Home Screen is the most relevant for the situation.

What's in this version:
Fixed the ΓÇ£blank widgetΓÇ¥ problem. (For real this time [we think...]).
Deactivated Dashboard Sleeping. (Needs a bit more work). They will appear as sleeping at startup, though.
7ΓÇ│ Tablets can now have 5 Dashboards. 10ΓÇ│ are limited to 4.
