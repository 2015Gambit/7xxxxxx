Nikki Heat is the lead character in Richard Castle's Nikki Heat book series.

Heat is "loosely" based on NYPD detective Kate Beckett, possessing a similar backstory, in that her decision to become a detective was motivated by the death of someone close to her - although Heat has a niece and siblings that Beckett lacks - and the first case she investigates is adapted from several real cases Castle helped Beckett solve. Heat is assisted by her partner and sometime lover, journalist Jameson Rook. In addition, her colleagues Detectives Raley and Ochoa also work with her on cases.

Note: Since I uploaded the book 4 in the series, I figured its only fair if I upload them all incase someone hasn't read the earlir books.
