Thanks for putting in the effort to do a full rip...it's really a great watch! Would be better with better commentary.....I hear that the Manos commentary was really, really good...so I'm pirately expecting a great transfer of that, too. At least somebody cares. It's a weird dynamic, I know. Thanks, really! You rock it."
