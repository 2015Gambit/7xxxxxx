New devices and platforms emerge daily. Browsers iterate at a remarkable pace. Faced with this volatile landscape we can either struggle for control or we can embrace the inherent flexibility of the web.
Responsive design is not just another technique--it is the beginning of the maturation of a medium and a fundamental shift in the way we think about the web.
Implementing Responsive Design is a discussion about how this affects the way we design, build, and think about our sites. Readers will learn how to:

Adopt a responsive workflow from the very start of a project
Enhance content for different devices
Use feature-detection and server-side enhancement to provide a richer experience
