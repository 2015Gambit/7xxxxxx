Before proceeding to root the LG Optimus 3D phone, there are a few things that need to be done:
Before You Start

    Ensure that the phone is left with a charge of at least 70% so that it doesnΓÇÖt get turned off during the rooting process.

    Back up all the data on your phone so that it can be restored safely if any data on the phone is lost. Here are suggested tips for doing that:

        Text Messages ΓÇô Use the SMS Backup and Restore app (LINKS INSIDE)

        Phone Contacts ΓÇô Sync with Gmail application

        Call Log ΓÇô Use the Call Logs Backup and Restore app (LINKS INSIDE)

        Pictures, music, videos, files, etc. ΓÇô Copy to the internal/external
        SD card

         Internet & MMS Settings ΓÇô Backup all the settings from the path
          ΓÇ£Applications > Settings > Wireless and Network > Mobile Networks >
          Access Point NamesΓÇ¥
          Make sure to quit programs such as firewalls, antivirus, and tools
          like Samsung KIES , because these generally tend to interrupt the 
          process of the firmware update.
 
          Additionally, USB debugging must be enabled on your phone through
          the path ΓÇ£Settings > Applications > Development > USB debuggingΓÇ¥.
