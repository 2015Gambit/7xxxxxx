This time Max and Stacy discuss that after five years of depressing depressed savers, the government and Central Bank reaps the rewards while Americans have given up hope and now concede to being 'lower class.' In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Chris Cook about the price of chickens in Tehran and petrol in the United Kingdom and the role of ETFs in destroying markets.
