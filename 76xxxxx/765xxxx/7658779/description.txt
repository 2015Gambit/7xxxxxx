With video game sales in the billions and strong opinions about
their potential and their peril growing louder, Glued to Games: How
Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound brings something new to the
discussion. It is the first truly balanced review of the psychology of video
game motivation and engagement, based on years of research with thousands of
gamers. The book addresses both the positive and negative aspects of game play
by drawing on significant recent studies and established motivational theory to
explore the fundamental drivers of engagement, how games satisfy basic
psychological needs, and how an understanding of these factors can be applied
to controversial topics such as video game violence and game addiction.


Filled with examples from popular games and the real experiences
of gamers themselves, Glued to Games gets to the heart of
gaming's powerful psychological and emotional allure--the benefits as well as
the dangers. It gives everyone from researchers to parents to gamers themselves
a clearer understanding of the psychology of gaming, while offering
prescriptions for healthier, more enjoyable games and gaming experiences.
