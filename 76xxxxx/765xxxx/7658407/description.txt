Filmed entirely on location in the Caribbean, this production tells the adventurous tale of a Puerto Rican boy who befriends a Paso Fino Palomino, a descendant of the horses of the Spanish conquistadors. The lad kidnaps the horse in order to ride in the island horse championships and, in so doing, learns a lesson in responsibility and honor.
