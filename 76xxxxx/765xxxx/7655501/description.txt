Summary
Publication Date: June 14, 2012
The definitive analysis of the events, ideas, personalities, and conflicts that have defined Obama's foreign policy.
When Barack Obama took office, he brought with him a new group of foreign policy advisors intent on carving out a new global role for America in the wake of the Bush administration's war in Iraq. Now the acclaimed author of Rise of the Vulcans offers a definitive, evenhanded account of the messier realities they've faced in implementing their policies.
In The Obamians, acclaimed author James Mann tells the compelling story of the administration's struggle to enact a coherent and effective set of policies in a time of global turmoil. At the heart of this struggle are the generational conflicts between the Democratic establishment -- including Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton, and Joseph Biden -- and Obama and his inner circle of largely unknown, remarkably youthful advisors, who came of age after the Cold War had ended.
Written by a proven master at elucidating political underpinnings, even to the politicians themselves, The Obamians is a pivotal reckoning of this historic president and his inner circle and of how their policies may or may not continue to shape America and the world.
