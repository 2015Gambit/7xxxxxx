Notes

First press information...

If this doesn't have "SS RL" etched in the run-outs then it is a repress - remastered at Atlantic, rather than Sterling Sound.
 Around 200,000ish pressings were done of Robert Ludwig's 'high mix' which, like Hendrix's 'Ladyland' 1st masters, caused some poor-quality phonograph needles to 'skip'. Thus, a repress ordered by Ertegan at Atlantic.

What Exactly Is An "Ultimate Master"

 It is more or less a catchphrase originally used to designate something was a hi-res rip. But since there seems to be a lot "similarly" <cough> named rips now I guess I should explain.

 I try to present the "ultimate mastering" of a particular LP, the "mastering" is not my equipment or process but the source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is "definitive" is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.
