,hamnyuae,2012-09-26T20:27Z,I Will Download it on my Macbook 2011 10.6.8 and i will tell you is it working or not Â 
,gearflux,2012-09-26T22:19Z,"I have downloaded it and I can get into the game, but sometimes it crashes my MAC when I want to play a Free Training, or a simple match before choosing the teams. And i can't do nothing after that. Just pressing the Power Off of my macbook. But I did a Exhibition Match and a Free Training on the first times I entered the game. But most of the times it crashes and there's nothing else I can do. Does anyone have the same problem ?

I have a MacBook Pro 6.2
Snow Leopard 10.6.8 
Intel Core i5 2,4GHz
4GB RAM
nVidia GT330M 256mb

Besides this, when I did the matches, the game ran perfectly and smoothly :)"
