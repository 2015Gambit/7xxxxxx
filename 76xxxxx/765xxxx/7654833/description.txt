"We're proud to present our new online series, Tornado Chasers. It's my dream to bring this to the world for free, but until we can make ends meet, thank you for your generous support. The professional, TV-quality production of Tornado Chasers was funded entirely out of our own pocket. Each one of you is an important part of our team, and I'll be forever thankful for you helping us do the only thing we know -- chase storms." ~Reed Timmer
