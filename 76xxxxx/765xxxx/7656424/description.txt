ΓÇ£Fuck You is a track that people can very much relate to.ΓÇ¥ He says. ΓÇ£At some point in life people are talked about negatively in attempt to bring them down physically and mentally.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£This track is an anthem for all of us.ΓÇ¥ With plans of releasing his debut EP later this year; titled ΓÇ£Not For The Faint Of HeartΓÇ¥, dEnNy333 hopes to finally gain the success that he deserves.
