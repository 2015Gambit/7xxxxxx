Runway (2010) Bangla Movie (Tareq Masud)- Drama
The story of the film centers around the youth Ruhul, who lives with his family in a small hut next to the runway of the international airport. His mother Rahima struggles to support the family by selling milk from a cow bought with a micro credit loan. His sister Fatima works long hours in a garments factory. There’s been no word from their father for over a month, since he left for a job in the Middle East. A madrasa dropout, Ruhul spends his days wandering under the shadow of the planes, aimless and frustrated in his futile efforts to find work. One day at a cyber café he meets Arif, a computer savvy young man who exudes confidence and a sense of purpose. The world Arif introduces him to seems inspiring and new, but eventually Ruhul’s life spirals into a nefarious netherworld of intolerance, violence and ultimately, death…
