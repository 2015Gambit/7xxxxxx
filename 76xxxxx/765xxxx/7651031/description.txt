Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, September 18 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues to run down the prospect of world war or at best a regional conflagration in the Middle East as protests against an anti-Islamic video engulf the Muslim world and the West and Israel prepare an attack on the final Shiite domino, Iran. 

He also talks about the coming economic devastation of endless QE as the Federal Reserve and the central banks comprising the international bankster elite make their move to take down economies, eradicate national sovereignty, consolidate wealth and power and usher in authoritarian world government. 

Prison Planet.com editor Paul Watson covers new ammo purchases by the feds and the drift toward martial law.
