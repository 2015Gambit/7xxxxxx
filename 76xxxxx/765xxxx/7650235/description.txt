Powered by the revolutionary FIFA Soccer gameplay engine, and introducing
Street Ball Control, FIFA Street will deliver an arsenal of groundbreaking
street dribbling styles and trick moves that ignite the one-on-one battles
within matches. Whether performing one panna after another without breaking
a sweat the way street soccer is played in Amsterdam, or a physical,
fight-for-possession style the way players compete in London,
fans will enjoy a superior fidelity of ball control and responsiveness
than anything ever experienced in a soccer videogame. Plus, for the first
time ever, utilize aerial skills to maneuver past opponents, an all-new
sophisticated one-touch passing system for quick, precision passes,
and over 50 never-before-experienced skill moves.
