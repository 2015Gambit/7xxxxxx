Calibre Companion is two applications in one.

The first: Calibre Companion supports connecting to calibre over WiFi and be detected by calibre as a device.
- All calibre device operations are supported, including sending books and metadata, cover thumbnails, deleting books, sending news, and plugins like Reading List.
- You can specify where different book formats are to go on your device, e.g., epubs in one folder, pdfs in another, and mobis in a third.
- Calibre Companion can update the metadata for the books on every connect, ensuring the information is up to date
- Most setup is on the device, making it easy for different users in the same household to have different device configurations, or to use more than one computer running calibre.

The second app: Calibre Companion is a library organizer for your device. You can:
- Sort books by title, author, series, date changed or read, with both ascending and descending sorts.
- Group books by title, author, tags, series, publisher, and most calibre custom column types; including optional navigation by first letter.
- View a "book jacket" showing all the details of a book, including calibre's custom columns.
- Launch your book reader application to read a book (works with most reader applications).
- Search for books using calibre-like search syntax.
- Scan your library folders for books not in Calibre Companion's database and adding them. This process uses calibre to help get the highest quality metadata available.
