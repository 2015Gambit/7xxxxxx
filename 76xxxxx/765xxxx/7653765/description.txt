This is a leaked copy of the new arrange OST of TWEWY, a great game for the DS released in 2007.

It's known as πüÖπü░πéëπüùπüìπüôπü«πü¢πüïπüä -Crossover- and I have gotten a copy early and decided to share it with everyone here. This OST has a few new tracks from the iOS remake, the remixes from KH3D, some new arranges, and an original track. All of these are full length, so do not worry about this being some sample.

Please enjoy it and tell me what you think.

It was very hard to get this due to it not being released yet.
