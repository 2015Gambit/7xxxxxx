They can't be final because you often upload new versions. BTW Could you somehow find Dragon's Lore? It's something like cubis, not violent and appropriate for kids. Thanks!"

When i upload them my friend its the final version.The downloader must know that.When someone search for an app he/she will see the final version and download this not the older.Make the request in the thread that i have in my description and i will try to upload it."

Thank you for your help, I didn't understand, I was sure 'final' had to to with a terminated application or something.

I'm not registered there and I'm not sure if I should do it just for 1 game. So if you remember my REQ - it's great. If you forget it or are too busy - it's not a problem. Again, thanks for your fantastic work."
