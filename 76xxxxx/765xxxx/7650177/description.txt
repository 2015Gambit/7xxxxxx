DISCRIPTION:
Welcome to Hong Kong, a vibrant neon city teeming with life, whose
exotic locations and busy streets hide one of the most powerful and
dangerous criminal organizations in the world: the Triads.

In this open world game, you play the role of Wei Shen, an undercover
cop trying to take down the Triads from the inside out. You'll have to
prove yourself worthy as you fight your way up the organization, taking
part in brutal criminal activities without blowing your cover. Torn
between your loyalty to the badge and a criminal code of honor, you
will risk everything as the lines between truth, loyalty and justice
become permanently blurred.

Features:

A mature and gritty undercover cop drama in which you risk blowing your
cover at any time.

Explosive action fueled by a seamless mix of deadly martial arts,
intense gunfights and brutal takedowns.

Epic high-speed thrills: Burn up the streets or tear up the sea in a
vast array of exotic cars, superbikes and speedboats.

fights, or kick back with some karaoke. There are countless ways to
entertain yourself in Hong Kong's diverse districts.
