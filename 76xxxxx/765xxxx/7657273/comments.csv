Before demonoid went to pot all of these would have been on the site.  And today...I suggest you and everyone else that loves comcis to download something called DC++ and join some comic hubs.  They have every old and new comic IN EXISTENCE I shit u not.  Once u get the hang of things it's even easier than utorrent.

Also it's not just for comics.  It's awesome for audiobooks/ebooks as well especially now that demonoid is gone.

Anyway not trying to mock you, but if you truly searched high and low for these comics...well...you need to get better at searching heh."
