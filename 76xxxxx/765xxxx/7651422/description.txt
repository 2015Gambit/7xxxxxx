Statistics: The Art and Science of Learning from Data, Third Edition, helps students become statistically literate by encouraging them to ask and answer interesting statistical questions. This book takes the ideas that have turned statistics into a central science in modern life and makes them accessible without compromising necessary rigor. Authors Alan Agresti and Christine Franklin believe that itΓÇÖs important for students to learn and analyze both quantitative and categorical data.  As a result, the text pays greater attention to the analysis of proportions than many other introductory statistics texts.  Concepts are introduced first with categorical data, and then with quantitative data.
 
The Third Edition has been edited for conciseness and clarity to keep students focused on the main concepts. The data-rich examples that feature intriguing human-interest topics now include topic labels to indicate which statistical topic is being applied.
