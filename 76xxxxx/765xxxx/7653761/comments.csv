,benedictluna,2012-09-20T00:20Z,yes please to the spanish version which will hopefully be a smaller file. thanks for your efforts...
,BarcaForca,2012-09-20T00:42Z,"Hi Nepotu,

Thanks for your work, PLEASE PLEASE UPLOAD A MORE SMALLER VIDEO SIZE, 9 GBs. is too big, even 720p is alittle high, and if possible anything but Mpeg. format. Avi. is always good. I am eternally grateful for your work!

Barce Por Siempre!!"

,BarcaForca,2012-09-20T00:51Z,"IF YOU COULD UPLOAD THIS MATCH, ANY SIZE UNDER 2 Gbs. and possibly avi. format, just that avi. is very playable on any dvd, ps3 and program players.


Thanks"
