,javi86,2012-09-20T03:59Z,"Thanks man worked great, everything in sync!! Just have one question, like I said, when I watched this on my pc, everything is good, but then I passed it on to a flash drive to watch it on my tv, and the audio is out of sync there. Any suggestions on why this may be happening?"
