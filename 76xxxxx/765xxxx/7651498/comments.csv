,nabsltd,2012-09-19T18:31Z,"The listed 1280x544 is the wrong aspect ratio...it should be around 1280x692 as the movie was 1.85:1 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098621/technical).

Does anyone know if this is just a mistake in the info, or if the file is actually the wrong ratio?"
,nabsltd,2012-09-20T17:13Z,The info is correct and this encode is cropped to 2.35:1 from the original 1.85:1.
,ofpirate,2012-09-21T09:44Z,cropped is an under-statement - this print has been completely butchered! framing is so bad its difficult to even watch.. extremely disappointing
,ofpirate,2012-09-21T09:47Z,"better of going with this one folks
