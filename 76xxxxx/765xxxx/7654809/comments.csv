,kinhogoto,2012-09-20T16:46Z,"Sorry if you're right but.. The category is shown in my browser ""CDs de ﾃ「dio"" wich means ""Audio CDs"" and thats plural, and since I'm uploading more than one cd I guess it's ok. Is there a page where it is made clear wich category each file should be in? Please let me know, I had some trouble uploading cause of that"
