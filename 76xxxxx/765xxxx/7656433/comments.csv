I also bought Diablo 3 Collector's Edition for 100 euros, and this game blows it out of the water! It has LAN support as well as mod compatibility (something Diablo 3 will never have).
It's funny how games not worth playing cannot be cracked, but this little gem is crackable.
20 euros is 2 pizzas here in Sweden. Torchlight 2  is a lot more fun than 2 pizzas!!"

Great game must inform you all though that there are bugs that can make the game unplayable,
you get pushed through walls etc. and when you quit and reload you´re still in that unplayable place and can´t continue and have to restart... 

One way is to backup the save files every once in a while to at least have some security :) save files are under

Many, many moons ago, the ""demo"" scene (Essentially: Hey guys! Check out what wikked stuff I can do with only 100kb of code!) and the ""pirate"" scene overlapped to a great degree.

We see remnants of this in the **FUCKING ANNOYING** Music in cracks, keygens, etc.

I think it's supposed to make you feel better: 

For instance: 

""Well, I pirated the game, but I had to listen to 30 seconds music piped straight from hell to my computer speakers."" This torture (should) relieve the guilt of piracy.

It's rumored that listening to a full 5 minutes of keygen/crack music will cure cancer, but NO ONE is ever going to find out!"

For those who cant get it working , it might be because you've done something wrong in the instructions or maybe something wrong in the past when installing other programs/games .

This is how I did it : 
1)Download
2)Mount (with Power ISO)
3)Go to Computer and double click the mounted game .
4)Follow the simple steps in installing ( if it asks you to repair your microsoft redist +2008 or 2010 . Just click yes and repair it .
5)Once done installing , go to my computer and right-click the mounted game , click open .
6) Then , you must be seeing a folder called 'Crack' . Open it and copy all its contents to your directory .
7)Now , create a shortcut if u like and play the game ! :D

,FryeCook,2012-09-26T16:45Z,"I've installed this, it runs great. But whenever I try to play LAN games with my mates, we can't see our LAN games. Help?"
,Shadow416,2012-09-26T20:09Z,excellent upload easy install....my only issue with the game itself is i don't like how you move and attack its the same button so if you want to range attack you might mis click and end up getting to close a stupid thing developers  did lol
,hellboundsx,2012-09-26T20:33Z,"in fact you can play multiplayer in this game if pirated, if you see theres a lan mode in the game so just download tunngle and enter in one of the rooms of TL2 and play with others :)"

Runic deserves all of our money."
,XilE-,2012-09-27T16:49Z,"@Fugie Why's that? I pirated it.. Well I actually bought it too I was just broke at the time I downloaded it lol. However I still play it on Tunngle since I already have a good start on my guy.

A pirate is not a bad person.. If you go out and kill someone then yeah you're a bad person. If you rape someone then yeah.. 

So I guess I'll leave saying this.

Arrrrr Mother Fucker :P I mean that in a good way rofl."

Now, I open up the folder that says Cracked in steam, then tried to move it over to the data in The main installed disk. It then said that Operation is not Allowed or something like that. I'm tired. Can someone help me?"
