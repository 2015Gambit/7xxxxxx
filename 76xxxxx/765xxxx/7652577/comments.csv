Simple facts: There have never been no Adam, Abraham, Noah or other mythical persons from desert legends. The story about Jesus have much similarities with legends of that time. Muhammad might have lived, the stories of his life is inconsistent and at best legends. Among other that he as the ruling class and an buisnessman too, wouldnt be able to READ. There were a lot of christian churches at his time on the arabian peninsula. Google for example Church Jubail.

Islam is founded right on christianity, with for example the hebrew angel Gabriel/Jibreel!"
