,Juozis,2012-09-22T04:04Z,"Hello,
I'm new here. I played this game for awhile and I must say a few things. First of all the torrent itself is great, thank you uploader. Second, in comparison to the original, this remake features some changes (like mana and new interface, also you can no longer drink potions when the game is paused;) ). The new graphic make-up is not so impressive, mostly it just gives me a weird blur when I look at it. Control are hard to handle, I have a theory that they were meant for spiders from space, but I am used to this sort of thing by now. I really like the new leveling system so far (skills increases as you use them). But I have doubts if a lot of people will buy this game, between the Dungeon Lords original, Dungeon Lords Collectors edition and Dungeon Lords MMXII, that is three separate purchases fans had to make over the years, and this is still the same game they are paying for, same story, same characters, same ugly character faces, unless you are driven by nostalgia, you probably wont pay to hear the same characters talk about same old speeches and crawl through same old (renewed mind you, but still same old) dungeons. I would really like to give the new multiplayer feature a go, but the game probably wont be released where I live anyway. "
,isilox,2012-09-22T13:34Z,Anyone can say if it's worth a download? There are zero review on the internet and I never played previous DLs.
,ZoSo77,2012-09-22T19:19Z,Thanks for the input Juozis. Going to give this game a try
,kuroyanagi,2012-09-23T19:46Z,"I just got this, and this was really sad.  The graphics have gone from primitive to just plain grotesque, and that is really all I can comment on since I couldn't even make it in to the sewers.  The goblin that usually opens them wouldn't move from his spot.  Also, whenever I saved, the save file would be corrupted.  Not worth the download."
,hopedeny,2012-09-24T14:34Z,"there are no reviews because this game is not out yet. i cant say, having not downloaded this, but i suspect this is actually the previous game, especially given the size. not out til the 28th."
,Juozis,2012-09-24T18:53Z,"hello hopedeny,
it's actually out on 25th, and this torrent sadly is the actual game that is going to come out. It wont get any better than this."
