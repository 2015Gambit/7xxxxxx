,cybergodsig,2012-09-18T23:19Z,These kill MFSL's because the MFSL's have no dynamics like these do.
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-19T15:56Z,"While you're waiting for this to download (be patient it could take weeks), listen to the newer Sectors Box Set here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6900039/RUSH_Sectors_2011_Box_Set_(remastered)_FLAC

I suspect it sounds better anyway.... we'll see, maybe."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-19T17:13Z,Stop posting your shit on my torrents you piece of shit Jordan.  Fuck your remasters get the original.  Jordan go lick the green discharge in your moms undies. 
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-19T18:03Z,"^^^ Ahhhh, showing that maturity again....

It's about the music junior, not your misguided sense of what is ""yours""."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-19T18:46Z,"Listen up fuckboy, when someone posts a torrent you don't post your torrent in it out of respect.  You have no respect."
,jkp159,2012-09-19T21:18Z,"speaking of respect cyberdogsi,  I noticed you talking shit on random uploads that don't have anything to do with your problem.   Please try to keep your ugly nonsense on your worthless torrents and stop spreading your disease to the rest of the bay.    Thank you for considering this request.   "
,cybergodsig,2012-09-19T21:54Z,"Oh, did I mention jordan is a piece of shit.  JKP go lick the green discharge in your moms undies."
,tuubazz,2012-09-19T22:53Z,"What the hell is wrong with you, Cyber-dog-sick? Firts you screw up all your own torrents and now you go around spamming other peoples torrents like a little baby with hurt feelings. Grow up!"
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-19T22:58Z,"cybergodsig,

I'm starting to question your ability to pay attention.  Let's try this again.  Concentrate. Focus. Sound out the words slowly....

1:  When you declare something is the ""best"" be prepared for someone else to have a different opinion.  Also brace yourself for the possibility of being wrong...

2: NOTHING about these torrents your posting is ""yours"" except maybe the bandwidth (or lack thereof) your using to seed them....

As I've said before, if we ever get to hear these Rush CDs then we'll see which are the ""best"""
,cybergodsig,2012-09-19T23:23Z,"Jordan is a piece of shit, and will continue to pay for his bs."
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-20T00:18Z,"^^^^ Unless you have the ability to take down my HD..... hmmmm, doubtful considering you struggle to seed, then calling me names hardly qualifies as making me, ""pay for my bs"".  But, go ahead, continue to prove to the world you have the maturity of a 12 year old.  Hell, you prob. are...

btw, according to my torrent client, you've lost the one seed for these ""best sounding Rush cds"".  Looks like no one will ever know that you were wrong.... again.

We all eagerly await the next ""best"" sounding music that we won't be able to ever hear.

Have fun junior...."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-20T02:05Z,"Yeah thats right its too bad they won't get them.  Go post your torrents on other peoples torrents, not me anymore you rude asshole. People don't put torrents up so you can put your remaster on it. der"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-20T02:07Z,jordan is a piece of shit
,jkp159,2012-09-20T04:26Z,"I never thought I'd have the opportunity to discuss my mother's underpants in the comments to a Rush torrent.     The future is amazing.   

Cyberdogsic's uploading skill is not so amazing."
,canadianice,2012-09-20T17:20Z,"Thanks so much, stuck at 71% because of a childish spat. Could anyone please reup this?  thanks"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-20T20:24Z,"I'm glad your not getting it Canadianice your just as bad as jordan, fuck you both."
,canadianice,2012-09-20T22:48Z,"You stupid little twit, take your meds. Can you sat add?"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-21T02:44Z,"I bet when your friend introduces you to his girlfriend you jump right in after her, just like posting your torrents in other peoples torrents.  Get your own game if you can.  This message is for jordan who is a piece of shit.  I would of hooked everyone up with the rarest and the best."
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-21T03:08Z,"You're stuck Canadianice because cybergodsig either doesn't have the bandwidth or still can't figure out how to upload.

Noone can reup want they don't have and prob. never will.

But, if I ever get completed files and I think, ""they are the best sounding"" I'll reup myself..... "
,canadianice,2012-09-21T03:23Z,"Thank you rjordan, I have the sectors box set, and i feel it would be tough to beat, but i keep an eye ot---thanks man"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-21T04:01Z,"you guys are idiots, search rush cd's steve hoffman and check out those posts and you'll see what you missed out on.  Enjoy that sorry ass remaster box."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-21T04:03Z,Hey jordan maybe I got tired of you posting your torrents in mine so I took it down?  Its possible.
,canadianice,2012-09-21T06:17Z,"If you took it down because of that, you are a bigger BUFOOOON than i thought."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-21T21:44Z,"I give them too you, if you can respect my music knowledge and not post album links it would be appreciated."
,canadianice,2012-09-21T21:51Z,"this clown wants help seeding, then pulls the plug at 74%, What a FUCKTARD!!!!!"
,arakaneuman,2012-09-22T10:32Z,"zzzzlow, come on!"
,CTR-3000,2012-09-22T14:01Z,"I have been seeding some of this wankers torrents for the good of TPB but sadly i don't have the files for this torrent.

Cybergodsig just kill yourself you useless fuck"
