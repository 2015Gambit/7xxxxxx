,goldpianogarden,2012-09-22T05:01Z,"^^That ""Hide Away"" in the IMDB link is from 1995.  So, you're saying it's the one from 17 years ago, not one from 2011 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536374/)? "
,goldpianogarden,2012-09-22T05:04Z,"edit:  the one from 1995 is spelled 'Hideaway', and the one from 2011 is 'Hide Away'...  No idea which one this is..."
,Yaboo56,2012-09-22T09:14Z,"Checked the NFO and Poster.jpg, it's definitely the one from 2011 starring Josh Lucas
