 If you want a higher-than-average-CAM-quality version of this film, I suggest Horrorspoke's torrent in the link above."
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-09-21T14:53Z,"@TheHeiliger:-
Horrorspoke's torrent frame rate is 23.976fps so there so difference it both of them."
,TheHeiliger,2012-09-21T17:55Z,"@Gh0stNet: My mistake, Gh0stNet. My apologies, and thank you for correcting me. You are right. For some reason, your file's frame rate seems far lower on my machine (watching on VLC) than the one I linked to above, however; it may just be on my end. Thanks for uploading!"

,jonnycinq,2012-09-22T22:20Z,"I think its more that the frame rate drops when theres motion, something in the capture or conversion was unable to handle."
