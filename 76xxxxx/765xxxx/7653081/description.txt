The call to repentance and faith. Faith requires a foundation of true knowledge about the Person and work of Christ. One must abandon all trust and confidence in one's own efforts and abilities.This leads to complete trust in Christ and His provision for salvation and reconciliation with the Heavenly Father. Repentance requires the permanent turning from the past sinful ways of life, and turning completely onto the path of righteousness to glorify God.
