Here is the official World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria Soundtrack.

I'm not the person that uploads most, so if anything is done wrong, please give me feedback.

If you do not trust my upload, simply do not download it!



I could not find the album art that looks like the one i have on google so there is no art. I am sorry.


This is not a rip, It's my work on the upload as i got the Collectors Edition bit early. 

Enjoy the music as much as i will do.
