and as for the ungrateful wretches moaning about it not being 5.1, STFU, go & buy the retail if you want surround sound or download a much bigger file. Never ceases to amaze me how ungrateful these spotty little adolescents are.

Quiet apart from which, stereo is actually better for the vast majority of computer users, who probably in the main, have a 2.1 setup.

The audio of most of zenbuds uploads sound great on my Harmon Kardon Soundsticks system."

[V],Zen_Bud,2012-09-29T15:48Z,"@mikrovision Its your computer that's  corrupt!

Over 10.000 DL and suddenly the file is bad nice try TROLL!

Stay at minus spam is more in your league."
