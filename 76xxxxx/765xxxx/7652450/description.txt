Greetings!  Please enjoy this free unofficial album of various takes from songs that will be on our upcoming album, Redemption Songs.
This is the music that has gotten us through some of the tougher events of the last few years.  We hope it helps. 

Thanks for listening!
And long live TPB!
Thanks KAT!
