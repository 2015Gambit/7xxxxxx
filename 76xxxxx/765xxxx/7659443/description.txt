Whilst the G4S rebranding team head to Lincolnshire
to help rebrand the local police, and Apple's Nevada
team come to launch the new idodge app, James and
Barnaby head to local youth clubs and skate parks to
find out how ill-disciplined the youth of Broken
Britain are, before taking their findings to education
secretary Michael Gove. Meanwhile, Dale Maily
investigates arms manufacturers.
