,shikibane,2012-09-20T01:36Z,same here i played for 1 hour exited the game for a sec to do something came back pressed start game crashed
,klord2010,2012-09-20T12:23Z,"need some crackfix
or maybe patches"
,shikibane,2012-09-20T18:59Z,Apparently if you delete your save data you can play it and it doesn't crash but who wants to do that.
,Suomisisu,2012-09-20T22:48Z,"Real bummer this game. Visuals aren't anywhere near as a good as I thought they would be. They called this 'Jet Set Radio HD' I know that the quality is better than the Dreamcast rip. But c'mon SEGA. We've been asking for a remake or a sequel to Jet Set Radio FUTURE. For what... 7+ years now? And you make a remake/port of the Dreamcast version? This is 8€ on Steam, and I am so glad that I didn't waste my money buying. I would love, to love this but it's pretty terrible. The game has no widescreen settings, it has no extra graphical settings. It looks terrible on my 22"" 1080p monitor. I'm really shocked and really sad to be honest. I would have thought that I could at least force some Anti Aisling or something. But I can't. I understand this is basically an 'Indie' game but I'm a long time fan of JSR and JSRF. This just doesn't do the series justice. We want a port/sequel/remake of JSRF. With the same visuals as on the Xbox, in Widescreen supported quality. Shouldn't be hard to do, except you've been stupidly fucking focusing on Sonic. A long dead SEGA icon that no one gives a shit about anymore. Fucking hell, what a disappointment. So glad I didn't pay for it. I hope you read this SEGA!"
,madnn45,2012-09-20T23:39Z,"Suomisisu, what version are you playing? Dreamcast emulated maybe?

I´m playing this in my pc, connected to a 46"" tv, at 1080p, perfect widescreen ratio, 16x MSAA... It´s true that framerate are locked to 30fps, and textures seems blurry sometimes because are the original textures. But all you have said it´s not correct."
,FARetis,2012-09-21T03:14Z,does somebody knows how to delete the save data or a fix for the crash??
,Alduin1998,2012-09-21T04:46Z,"C:Users""user""AppDataLocalSKIDROW205950
save is located here deleting jetset___sys allows the game to launch but that's not really a solution."
,Xenous,2012-09-21T09:47Z,"Yeah, crashes for me after the first launch too. Crackfix please"
,maverickbleh,2012-09-21T17:21Z,Yeah same problem. Can't wait for a fix!
