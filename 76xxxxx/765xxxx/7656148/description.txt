Descoption:
  Age of Fear: The Undead King is a fantasy turn-based strategy. The game features a novel battle system, two campaigns with solid fantasy stories and very flexible multi-player and skirmish modes.

The story takes place in an untamed fantasy land, where three forces: the Human Kingdom, the Greenskins' Horde and the Undead Legion - are fighting for domination and survival.

You will encounter quick skirmishes, where wise unit's cooperation is essential. You will visit distant lands either as a honorable knight or an evil necromancer. You will conquer cities and destroy ancient evil!

REQUIREMENTS:
  Age of Fear requires at least Java version 1.6. We suggest using Oracle's Java Runtime Edition as it is the most mature Java Virtual Machine today.
  The game was implemented to work on laptop (1GHz Celeron + 1.5GB memory is enough!) and profiled extensively, thus you shall have no problem running it on low-spec hardware. Most of processing power is required by game's AI module, thus better CPU will provide smoother play (multiple cores are also supported!).
