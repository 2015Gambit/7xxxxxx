From the producers of Syfy's hit series ""Face Off"", ""Hot Set"" is an extreme design challenge pitting two Hollywood production designers each week in a head-to-head battle to design, build, decorate and ultimately create an original and signature movie set that transports the viewer into an immersive world.

Each week, two teams, led by talented production designers, will be challenged to create an immersive world around a surprise element - an unusual prop, character, or animal. They will have just 3 days and a limited budget to create an original space that holds up to the scrutiny of Hollywoodâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s top creative experts. (Source: Syfy Channel)
