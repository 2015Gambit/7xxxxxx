HQ rare uncensored promo music video from a promo DVD. "You Know How We Do It" is the second single from Ice Cube's fourth studio album Lethal Injection. It was released as a 12" single on February 2, 1994. A G-funk hit which has the same kind of mood and feeling from The Predator. It samples "The Show Is Over" by Evelyn Champagne King and uses an interpretation of "Funky Worm" by The Ohio Players. 
This music video, directed by Marcus Raboy was filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada and featured Ice Cube driving in a Low-rider and standing on top of casinos.

Lethal Injection is the fourth studio album by California-based rapper Ice Cube. Similar to the rapper's previous albums, it was a commercial hit, debuting at #5 on the Billboard 200 with 215,000 copies sold in its first week. However, it was heavily criticized for what many saw as Cube's pandering to gangsta rap, and toning down of the socio-political content found on his earlier efforts. The album's standing has increased over time.
