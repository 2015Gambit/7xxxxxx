,nowandever29tpb,2012-09-24T18:39Z,"This is crap.  Yes, it is the actual CD, but it is OLD and it comes as a .DAA (PowerISO) file.  The included PowerISO has a virus in the keygen.  Avoid this, there is better stuff out there."
[V],Stuff_and_Shit,2012-09-24T23:03Z,"@nowandever29tpb:
At least check out the file before you give a BS comment!

There is no .DAA file.
There is no PowerISO included, nor a keygen, let alone a virus.

It is the 2012 HTML Essential Training.
Nothing more, nothing less!

Open the .rar file with WinRAR instead of double clicking it, to be on the safe side and see for yourself."
