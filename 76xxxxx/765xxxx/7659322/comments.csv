,Buttdozer,2012-09-21T21:44Z,Is from 1080p source or just another upscaled 720p? Just asking.

,DubYou,2012-09-23T21:50Z,"@ plathman: According to Ridley Scott himself there's no Director's Cut release in mind for this film. It wasn't necessery for him to cut scenes out because he wasn't asked to do so by the rating comitee - which means he get to keep the film as he intended.

,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-09-24T06:12Z,"Upon viewing, this looks like a 720p upscale.  Lots of pixels and rings in dark scenes, and contrast shots show pixels as well.

I honestly do not believe this is true 1080p, but it'll do until the genuine article comes along."
,tpbuser8,2012-09-26T09:23Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!
