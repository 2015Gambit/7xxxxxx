Radiohead - The King of Limbs (2x10'' 45 RPM Newspaper Edition)

If you're looking at this, chances are you already know what it is. Specifically, this is WPWs fantastic vinyl rip. On the private trackers that have hosted this recently, the opinion seems to be unanimous that the sound quality of the 10" 45 release is the best, and that this rip in particular is superior to the other ones floating around.

    THIS IS THE BEST-SOUNDING EDITION OF ALL VERSIONS OF THE KING OF LIMBS

    Blows the official web download, CD release, and 1x12ΓÇ¥ 33 RPM out of the water.

    According to WPW, the ripper: the bass is ten times better and itΓÇÖs got a much wider (IMO better) soundstage. 45 rpm is always better than 33, as itΓÇÖs more information in the grooves, and it shows here. ThereΓÇÖs also no drop in quality towards the end of each side which is inevitable on single LPs. However, the surface sound is a bit louder (compare Codex to the single LP rip for example) since this was on clear vinyl, which I hate. Black vinyl is always the way to go. But itΓÇÖs not that bad at all. Listening at home, I choose this edition over the 33 rpm every time. Might as well sell that one.
