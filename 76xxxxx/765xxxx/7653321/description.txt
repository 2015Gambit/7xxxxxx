Beatles
Black Album (bootleg)
January 1969
London, England, UK

Compilation of outtakes from the "Get Back" sessions.  My favorite Beatles boot.

Lineage:  CD>EAC>FLAC(level 8)
My CD is the only one I've seen in many years of hunting; CDR and LP copies circulate abundantly.  

This torrent recieved a well-deserved 3500 downloads in the years since 14 April 2007 when I shared it at the now-deceased Tapecity and Demonoid; I'm pleased to see it find a new home here.  IIRC there was also a speed-corrected version on Demonoid.
