"Unpacking Mr. Global, Part Three,"

with Catherine Austin Fitts.


QE3 Infinite Quantitative Easing; the world that is dying and the world that is being born; where the money went; where some of the money is returning; fraud and the black budget; the three big lies; re-engineering the federal budget; the fiscal cliff; WTO and industrial food; what's up with space.


Parts One and Two aired on Guns and Butter November 2nd and 9th, respectively, of 2011. I am fairly certain that I still have both of those, and if there is interest, I would not mind making the three together as a package. Please leave a comment.



================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.
