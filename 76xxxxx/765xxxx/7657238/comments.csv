,c008,2012-09-22T04:39Z,Track 4 on the 2nd disc is the Freeform Five Remix not Freedom Five.
,KriLL3,2012-09-22T16:02Z,"Errm, what do you mean bought on iTunes? it's not out, you can only pre-order ""Expected Release: Sept 25, 2012"" and it costs 12 USD, which is a bit ouch, and frankly iTunes only has 320bps AAC, I wish they had lossless."
[T],FatFreddy417,2012-09-23T00:46Z,"@KriLL3 Lol, you clearly never bought anything from iTunes. iTunes sell you 256 kbps .m4a aac. You doesn't pay in the moment you pre-order, you pay when you download. Also it's already released in other countries, US isn't the only country in the world."
,djweir2012,2012-09-23T06:09Z,"Just downloaded this torrent.......ordering my 2CD album in afew days, LOVE deadmau5, great torrent."

,JesterM,2012-09-29T17:56Z,"I shall download this and I shall keep seeding, in the meantime, after this has finished downloading and I find my ears having an orgy, the seeding will continue for as long as I can keep it continuing. 
Much thanks, Bubanee. "
