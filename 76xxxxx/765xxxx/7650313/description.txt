Muslims should be isolated and be allowed no contact with other cultures.
People who aren't Muslims should abandon Islamic countries.
Islamic countries should have no Western internet access.
Muslims should not be allowed to be educated in Western universities.
Muslims should not be allowed to participate in Western markets.

Isolate them.

Why?

Islam teaches Muslims that no non-believer is innocent.
Islam advocates barbaric punishments upon the guilty, e.g. stoning, beheading, etc.

That is a big problem for non-believers.

Moderate Muslims are only Muslims who seek to convert people in a non-Islamic country so that Islamic law can be institutionalized.

Instituting Islamic law for everyone in the world is every Muslim's duty.


THERE CAN BE NO PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE WITH ISLAM BY ITS VERY DEFINITION

P.S. Are you Muslim? Please get off the internet. It'll only make you mad, and then someone will die.
