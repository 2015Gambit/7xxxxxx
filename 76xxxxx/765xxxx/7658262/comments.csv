,mattyisafatty,2012-09-24T16:59Z,"noobs, do your research before you just download anything. The new movie is The Dark Knight Rises, this is The Dark Knight Returns (completely different movies). It is meant to be animated. The reason why it says Part 1 is because Part 2 is a separate part and will be release spring next year.

,mikels12,2012-09-24T20:54Z,"Trust me,paying the donation fee for a scenetime account is well,well well worth it,if your wanting torrents super quick...i'm not spamming but i use pirate bay when i'm not in a rush plus TPB as alot more different stuff i.e computer software,older games etc etc...but scene time is brill if u cant wait hours for downloads to finish... 8gb xbox 360 game i dl'd in 33 min's with only 2 or 3 seeders and i was using next6 doors wifi :("
