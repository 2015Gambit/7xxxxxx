Well-known Shaw parable of an idealistic woman who discovers that doing good requires adapting to the nastier parts of human nature. I find the acting to be very mannered, but the story keeps our interest. The very real conflict felt by the title character makes us sympathetic towards what could have been a cardboard character.  Shaw takes numerous opportunities to expound his social ideas, but Barbara herself is the main point of interest.
