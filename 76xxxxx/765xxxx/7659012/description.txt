Raised in suburban Canada, Yum Yum developed an acute acumen
in the area of music production at a very early age. Heralded as a
pop prodigy before he was a teen, his talents were quickly
leveraged by many of the most popular artists and critically
acclaimed producers working in music today. While monetarily
compensated generously, the nature of the industry dictated that
Yum Yum could receive no credit for his work. As an internationally
in-demand ghostwriter and phantom producer working out of
Portland, Oregon, Yum Yum has accrued a significant amount of
funds which he has invested entirely in furthering his research into
the power of music.

Based on a hypothesis that specific sonics can nurture and heal
humans on a physiological level, Yum Yum utilizes ancient,
cutting-edge methods of sound generation to isolate temporal
wavelets that stimulate and control a multitude of bodily functions.
Examples of successes in his experimentation include: Synthesizing
rhythms that reverse the progressively decreasing heart rate
mammals exhibit as they age, identifying audio harmonic
frequencies that trigger an expansion in a subject╩╝s psychological
capability for empathy, and recognizing specific arrangements of
speech that elicit the production of endorphins in listeners.
Combining his savvy in pop arrangement with his innovative
scientific findings, Yum Yum shares the conclusive results on his
self-titled debut, releasing July 25th, 2012 on Futro Records
