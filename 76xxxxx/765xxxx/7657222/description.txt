QG 65 - Gravitational fields

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The Gravitational field and its properties are directly compared to Charged Columbic fields

Providing a geometric explanation of why NewtonΓÇÖs Gravitational attraction resembles a weak Charge interaction is revealed.

The sixty-fifth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
