No game has so long and rich a history as chess; more has been written about it than any other game. Curiously, however, little has been written about chesspieces. This profusely illustrated volume explores the evolution and development of the "tools" of the great game from the fifth through the twentieth century. F. Lanier Graham, Assistant Curator, Department of Architecture and Design of The Museum of Morlern Art, provides a history of chess through his discussion of the design and meaning of the pieces, and thus presents a fascinating subject from a new vantage point. Of particular interest is the section on the more important modern sets, which presents Mr. Graham's view that contemporary designs offer a new reality to the ancient and revered game.
