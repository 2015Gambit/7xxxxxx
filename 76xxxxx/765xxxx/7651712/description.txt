'Collected Essex County'

Top Shelf Productions, 2009

Written and Illustrated by Jeff Lemire

mdusanjay uploaded Vol 1-3 of this back in May (see the link below), and that version is perfectly acceptable as is. This version just sticks everything under one cover, adds a couple new short stories and some archival material (like, 40 extra pages, I think).
