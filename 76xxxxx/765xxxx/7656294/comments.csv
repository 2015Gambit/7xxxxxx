,pizzanice,2012-09-21T17:03Z,Legit. 10/10.
,rhetorded,2012-09-22T01:47Z,"Excellent upload! Found you in the comments of another one that was ~250 MB. 

Will definitely be purchasing if it kicks my ass."
,doodleb,2012-09-23T17:21Z,Not a 10/10. More like a 4/10. Why does nobody bother to make a DECENT quality rip. It doesn't take long to FLAC this and host it for those of us that don't want shitty quality.
,doodleb,2012-09-23T18:15Z,"MONEY dude, this isn't even gapless.

This is a fucking disgrace."
,Lobotomite,2012-09-23T23:28Z,OH MY FUCK thanks man never even knew this leaked 
,Lobotomite,2012-09-23T23:28Z,quality is perfectly fine don't mind the douchebag in the comments hes just an ungrateful bastard
,doodleb,2012-09-24T00:44Z,"Quality is fine if you don't care about quality. Uploading a FLAC version wouldn't kill anyone and if you seriously think this release is perfect, you are literally fucking retarded. It was ripped completely incorrectly and the gapless does not work as it should on the album. The beginnings and ends of the tracks are fucked up. If you even know BTBAM, you know every one of their fucking albums is gapless and is meant to be played that way. Don't tell me I'm ungrateful when I'm pointing out clear and obvious mistakes with this torrent. This is a fucking joke."
,doodleb,2012-09-24T00:58Z,"The best part is EVERY other release by numnumjuice is FLAC except this one. Wow dude, great work on that."
,numnumjuice,2012-09-24T02:30Z,"i hear you dude.I did not rip this myself just passing it along to give a lil taste of what to expect.Believe  me,i usually don't fucking touch mp3s,but this was a exception.Release date isnt till oct. 8th,so this works for the time being.You guys will have a proper flac as soon as i do."
,numnumjuice,2012-09-24T03:17Z,"Further more mr.doodleb, i have to admit I admire  your attention to detail,I upped this to 6 different torrent sites and your the only one who called that shit out.hopefully the flac will leak in the next few days.till then you just have to suffer,or wait.
On the other hand,seeing as you have uploaded ZERO torrents i dont think you have the right to be calling this a disgrace.Im guessing you signed up just to bitch on my torrent.So unless your a Demonoid refuge like myself,I dont give a fuck what you think.shut the fuck up and do better yourself.
Now I fell bad for flipping on a b.t.b.a.m. fan.Dont worry guy,we will have lossless/gapless soon.
have a nice day"
,doodleb,2012-09-24T04:24Z,"Hey man, thanks for the reply. I was overly upset because all of the comments said ""10/10"" and this is upsetting when it's not a proper rip or lossless. I appreciate your work in leaking it and other than the gapless being wonky I really have no other qualms with this. I apologize for flipping dicks on this one, but BTBAM is literally my favorite band and I like to get the full experience. As an uploader you should have standards or at least write a small note in the intro so WE can know what's up. It originally just looked like you made a shitty rip because we didn't know you weren't the source.

Thanks again, man."
,pizzanice,2012-09-24T11:01Z,"I noticed the clipping after. Regardless, stop being a little bitch and relax."
,doodleb,2012-09-24T22:17Z,"There's no clipping anywhere, what?

If you're going to release shit, don't make it look like you were the one that ripped it by not adding anything to the description, is it really that hard to say ""I didn't rip this, taken from (source)""? 

No, not at all. If you're gonna release torrents, try not to look like a stealing fuck who wants the credit.

Bitch."
,numnumjuice,2012-09-25T07:09Z,"oh my fucking god guy,get your fucking panties out of a twist.If its that fucking serious.Fine, ill list my fucking source when its not my fucking rip.If your so fucking curious this came from a anonymous link in a tor forum.i don't know who fucking ripped it,and i didn't think most people would give a shit.Most leaks aren't fucking perfect,and most leaks are not posted to torrents by there source.i don't give a fuck about credit,i was just trying to share the music goddammit.
This isnt no quest for fame,its not like theres fucking advantages of having a hot torrent,or being a fucking uploader.Most people cant even say fucking thanks,all most of yall do is fucking bitch,and fucking hit and run on shit.if anything its a fucking hassle.this fucking thing has been downloaded allmost 2000 fucking times in less than a week.that shit makes me nervous as fuck.Credit on piratebay dosent give you shit.Its not going make a better person cause i have respect from fucking faceless people on the the god damm internet.I do this shit for fun cause i like fucking music,and i like finding shit and sharing it for other people who want to hear the shit.i dont have to share shit with anybody,i do this shit cause i want to.
You wanna talk about standards dude,really?look where the fuck you are,most torrents have a one line description,people don't tell the bit rates half the time,and there arent any standards here at all.Shit is sickening.I really don't download to much from here,but i understand most people dont really know about other torrent sites,plus this place is filled with fucking trollers like yourself.
SO GO EAT A DICK DOUCHEBAG"
,dan12con,2012-09-25T10:21Z,Not gapless.  Not worth downloading.
,Vuldagar,2012-09-26T01:05Z,"Thank you numnumjuice. Totally worth the 2 minutes it took to download this for FREE. 

To the little girls complaining. THIS CD ISN'T EVEN OUT YET! QUIT BEING SO SELFISH! Don't like the torrent? Then wait a month and buy the CD and upload a copy of your own.  

Great torrent. Album is amazing. Pre-ordered it half way through listening. 

doodleb! You are ungrateful and I agree with Lobotomite. For a cd that hasn't even been released yet to the public, this is definitely acceptable. Pointing out flaws is one thing, but being a complete fucking asshole about it is another. 

Thank you numnumjuice"
,Vuldagar,2012-09-26T01:10Z,"doodleb  You're a fucking fat ass loser I bet. Get out of your moms basement, pop her titty out of your mouth, and go suck on a shotgun."
,doodleb,2012-09-26T05:43Z,"Lol you sound high and mighty buddy.

What's so hard about doing a proper rip? Hell, we could at least get functional gapless."
,numnumjuice,2012-09-26T07:00Z,"Its not hard at all,but most people dont care about technical stuff.i wish i did know who ripped this, id teach the guy how to rip a cd properly,but i dont.I know its a shame.I know plenty of people who have never change there default rip settings.There should be a class on it,or a public service announcement.lol"
,Vuldagar,2012-09-27T04:12Z,"Not high and mighty. I just appreciated what numnum provided since I am a huge BTBAM fan. You also say you're a big fan....doesn't seem like it. If you want a proper rip, then do it yourself.....oh wait. This album isn't out yet :P I hear where you are coming from but bitching about a cd that isn't out yet is like bitching about a cam rip for a movie in theaters lol 

I apologize for my shotgun comment. That was uncalled for. "
,mister_yuck,2012-09-28T05:54Z,"yea yea yea its not flac...this'll do me just fine until I go buy it. 

THANK YOU

one O the best bands around"
,doodleb,2012-09-29T03:27Z,"That's the entire point, Vaginaboy.

People should just do it right the first time, so the rest of us don't have to fix the fuck up.

Eat a dick."
,Vuldagar,2012-09-29T18:17Z,"How is that the point? Let's see your so called ""fixed"" version then..... "
,hailmetal,2012-09-29T21:05Z,"I made this account because you sir, doodleb, deserve to be bashed severely enough.

Okay first, this is a fucking leak; the uploader himself DOESN'T have the physical compact disc, so stop saying that he's doing a shitty job because he ain't the one who ripped the CD.

Second, you don't sound like a fucking BTBAM fan at all. ""I want quality""; ""I want full experience"", and blahblah bashing numnumjuice, if you want quality, go fucking buy it on the release date, like I, and all other BTBAM fan did, because you sound more like a damn cheap moron trying to sound like an I-know-everything-dude.

Finally, please, be grateful and shut your big mouth up.

P.S. Don't try to reply this comment to bash me, because you'll be digging further.


By the way, thank you numnumjuice for this upload, I absolutely love this album and I'll definitely buy the CD, thanks again! :D
"
,Buddha860,2012-09-30T02:31Z,indeed Doodleb. You may be the worlds worst troll. congratulations... though to anyone who wasted mental space processing his idiocy I would advise you not to do so with those of his kind in the future.
,doodleb,2012-09-30T05:03Z,"Not trolling at all. I really don't see why it's so hard for you assholes to understand I literally asked the poster to just give the information that the leak wasn't ripped by him at the description so there's no confusion. As it sits, it looks completely like this guy ripped it and did a piss poor job, considering the gapless completely does not work as intended and it's not lossless. I can tell you are not a fan of BTBAM because this doesn't bother you. It's absolutely a part of listening to their music and lossless means I'm getting exactly what the band intended me to listen to, without lost quality due to compression. Some of us care about this shit, and I blamed the poster because he didn't clarify that he got it elsewhere. These things are helpful.

Seriously, laughing so hard at all of you saying I'm not a true fan of BTBAM, you all must not listen to much music."
,doodleb,2012-09-30T05:26Z,"Allow me to contribute.

Gapless is mostly fixed with a short crossfader ("
,Buddha860,2012-09-30T08:34Z,"Now I see how you suck people in. You act just enough like a rational human being to make people think that it's worth trying to make you see that you're being a complete douchebag. I'd explain point for point where you're fucking up here but you are probably going to continue to be a piece of shit as I sincerely doubt that this behavior is rare for you... Maybe it is. Maybe you just got caught up in a wave of passion caused by the thought that you were about to be engulfed in the audial magic that is a new Between the Buried and me album only to find that is not as the band intended. But if that were the case and you  really were a decent human being then you would have just apologized and humbly ceased your douchebaggery. Alas, there is some twisted entertainment in arguing with trolls... so thank you I guess."
,hailmetal,2012-09-30T20:36Z,"I do not care about the gapless? I don't? I don't? Really? REALLY? This is a fucking leak and this is a way to get a preview of the album because I ain't gonna download the album once it'll be released, because I'm going to BUY it, that's why I'm not shitting on numnumjuice, he got you a damn preview, what do you want more? Like a said, cheap moron trying to sound smart, you are failing man, you are digging and digging further, you are totally asking for douchebaggary."
,TickTockTickTock,2012-10-03T20:22Z,"I don't normally care to comment, but the doucebagery in here is out of control....


I was hesitant to download this because of the ""gapless"" complaints.... so i was expecting a few seconds of gap at least.... IT'S LESS THAN HALF A SECOND!!!! 

King Douche's comments about ""knowing it wasn't ripped by the UL"" is null and void at this point. If that was your only problem you would have gotten over it already, since the UL appologised for not labeling the torrent to your standards. but psycologically there is still something wrong, so let's be honest.... that's not the real problem you have. 

A: This is a leak.
B: It's free
C: The Gapless is LESS THAN HALF A SECOND... big deal for a free leak.
D: What's REALLY going on with you dude?"
,Moozik,2012-10-03T21:59Z,"@doodleb

If you were a real fan you'd just wait for it to come out then. C:

But for real, just wait for it to come out. No need to yell at the man who uploaded the torrent because you're going to turn into an aspie because of 1/8th second gaps. 

Fix it yourself and reupload if you think it's that big of a deal. Help the community out instead of getting upset with uploaders."
,hmlgs,2012-10-04T10:21Z,"@doodleb You want what the band intended on you having? BUY THE FUCKING MUSIC. If you want it for free, be happy this guy has given a window to what you want. You snob mother fucker."
