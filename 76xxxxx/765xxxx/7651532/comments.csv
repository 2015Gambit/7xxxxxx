If it wasn't for the foley, the movie would've gotten a 9. The gunshot and footsteps foley artists were crap. They sound like someone striking tin cans. Anyway, another awesome rip from the YIFY team. Keep up the good work guys."

,ro4eva,2012-09-21T17:01Z,"YIFY,

I don't know how you manage to get such great a/v quality out of a 750mb 720p encoding.  Must be some ancient Chinese secret.

Anyways, you guys should be giving encoding lessons to some popular pay-for-use internet based movie rental/downloads companies which I won't name.

Amazing job guys, seriously amazing."
