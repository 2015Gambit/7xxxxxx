NOTES:
Ok late with this one but hey ho ...better late than never
Right used matines 720p and cleaned it up....changed the brightness,contrast,slight tweak on the colours,also
toned down the glare and also slightly changed the perspective pulling the right side mainly.
Audio we stripped and cleaned in AA changed all the EQ bands,then saved as mp3 and remuxed.
