Howdy, internets! I cannot accurately express how grateful I am for your support and it means the world to me. I truly believe sharing is caring, especially in the world of music, and this is my first gift to you. Feel free to download the torrent and share with as many people as you like. If you're feeling truly generous, you can download it in any format through my Bandcamp profile or get a dandy lower quality version from NoiseTrade. No pressure, though.

Disregard the "Anticitizen"s, that is the old name for this project and I haven't been able to change the URLs to the current name, Earthgiant. The name change is the result of a band called Anticitizen already existing. I like Earthgiant more, anyways.

Sincerely,
Earthgiant

P.S: If an administrator would kindly move this to Audio > Music I would heavily appreciate it. The torrent contains a music video so I had to place it in the Other section.
