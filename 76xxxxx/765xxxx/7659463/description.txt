The best American novel to emerge from WWI is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his love for an English nurse. Hemingway's frank portrayal of their love, caught in the inexorable sweep of war,glows with an intensity unrivaled in modern literature. It is a farewell to an attitude and a time that would never come again. "Tough, terse, two-fisted prose."ΓÇöBookPage
