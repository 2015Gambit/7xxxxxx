"Great show. It's cool to hear this early version of Lost/Saint--the lyrics in Saint of Circumstance are quite different from how it ended up. The music's pretty much the same, though they're still definitely feeling their way through that, too. An interesting opportunity to hear the evolution of such a great piece of music. The first Lost Sailor was just a month before this."
