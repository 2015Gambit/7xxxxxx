 Notes:
 There is 2 things to note about the sorce, first there there
 black pixels that run along the bottom of the image. Youll see
 is almost at an angle rising from left to right. This run for
 half the movie while the second half that black area on the
 bottom is filled in with the movie. I did not crop that.

 Around 59 minutes, on the left side of the frame there is another
 black area that appears. As the movie progresses that black area 
 grows in size by 4-5 pixels but its grows in such a way that at
 top of the frame it is at its widest and at the bottom of the 
 frame it is thinnest.

 Both of these defects are present on the source which leads me
 to believe that the production company that scanned the negatives
 is doing a horrible job.

 Besides these two points, this is still a good war film.
