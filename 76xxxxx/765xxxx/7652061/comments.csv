,tibird,2012-09-19T21:54Z,thanks again and will seed to at least 1.5 ratio. 
,tibird,2012-09-19T23:14Z,left the house for awhile and came back and had seeded at a ratio of 3.5 so ive done my part
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T02:59Z,"when it has 50 seeders its not too important its the other torrents with less then 10 often needs the extra help like the long island medium ones
else the torrent dies

ta"
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T03:30Z,"everyone should seed to ratio 1.3 per torrent

because its takes that much normally for one more person to get a full copy as your not seeding directly to one persons but the who swarm and
so some parts of the file you send go to others
so if everyone left at 1-1 ratio there would be many with 80 percent of the file and stuck"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-20T06:23Z,"almost gave up on this show,thnx pss.as far as seeding goes I like to hit at least 10 or more for good karma :)"
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T06:29Z,:o
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T06:31Z,"whats odd is the source is from scene I converted
but no one is upping the mp4s on TPB which I dont do.. Im xvid only

how come tvteam sceneline etc arent doing it very odd"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-20T07:07Z,you've got a point there.tvteam upload pretty much everything on tv & they've been doing  movies for about a year or so aswell
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T07:10Z,:O comments not showing annoying
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T07:15Z,"i heard from tne it was him btw

no doubt some joker will blame me for no tag in description for this one next lol oh well

no all have tags.. perhaps some are renames of renames or redos of original sources

but in the end we just want to see it not care how poor quality or who did it

i think the person who uploads to p2p is the risk taker the one who should get all the credit not the ripper.. if they rip it too then double credit to them

there wasnt to much feel sorry for scene caught in finland cos they are exclusive not sharers

"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-20T07:27Z,it was him that went off all bitchy crazy or it was him that is joshgates/zacbagans?LOL.when it comes to him lately thiers alot of things that could have been him
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T07:51Z,"think your right bi polar.. I had a friend like that.. one minute she was sweet and out of the blue was insulting and nasty.. i soon got fed up with being nice to her as well.. no long talk to her.. she still tried to say happy bday now and then though.. but thats me done with her lol

I post a comment on long island as well before

man this small default font sucks here.. too hard to see what I type most times.. its not even a bold font..

and browser zoom sucks.. means have to scrool more rest of page when I just want the comment font bigger"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-20T09:00Z,"I just read long island comment & like I said before,he can bitch all he wants about who re-encodes what,in the long run thats pretty much what he does by recording & then uploading shows"
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T09:15Z,:O
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T09:20Z,"unlike him and his mates who seem to do it for bragging rights and themselves

they arent here sharing their fav shows for all to get them like what I do.. they prob stop sharing if they got no thanks.. but I still do as I get no thanks on much of what I share as you can see on lack of comments but 100s of seeders LOL

think thats the big difference.. theres 2 groups of uploaders..  the braggers and the sharers

I like to get stuff out there for all to be amazed or learn from .... thats why I dropped many reality shows
which were just fun and funny but numbminding.. im going back to the more educational shows like dealers and ufos and docus and ghost investigations

also means  I have more data for the better content"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-20T10:57Z,"I try to comment on everything I get but I do forget to when I'm stoned or sleepy some times.I always +1 tho so if you see +1 & no comments its a good chance it was me & I just got too high to type a thank you to go with it....speaking of which,its time to smoke & go to bed"
,tibird,2012-09-20T19:45Z,well I dont usually get long island medium ones but I might just do it just so I can seed it for a bit :)
