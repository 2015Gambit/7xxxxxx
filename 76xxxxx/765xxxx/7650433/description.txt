From Hotpress review of the album:

The Maggies are Tríona and Maighread Ní Dhomhnaill, Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh and Moya Brennan, all Irish speakers from Donegal and each already revered for their individual work with such acclaimed groups as The Bothy Band, Clannad, Coolfin and Altan. Not only do the four singers turn in superb individual performances on this bi-lingual CD, but their ensemble work is often of a sublime quality. They play most of the instruments and wrote and arranged the material too.

With the hypnotic rhythmic thrust and stunning harmonies on ‘Wedding Dress’ they set out their stall early, and little that follows on this 11 track offering falls below that dizzying standard. ‘Domhnach na Fola’ has a widescreen wistfulness that evokes bygone times, and there’s a beguiling lightness to the pulsating ‘Bíodh Orm Anocht’. ‘Mother’s Song’ has a Clannad-style plaintiveness, while the bubbling ‘Cuach Mo Londubh Buí’ takes on a West African hue via Moya’s deft djembe. Richard Thompson’s more traditional ballad ‘Farewell Farewell’ is adorned by Triona Ní Dhomhnaill’s subtle accordion and some more dazzling harmonies.

The Maggies are an invigorating and more than welcome addition to the scene. Extraordinary talent with a capital T.
