,hulivar,2012-09-20T19:54Z,"why does everyone always complain about what type of file the media is in?  First off if you care that much convert it on your own.  Secondly...if you care that much but are stoopid, just download VLC media player.  It will play just about any media file on earth and it's highly superior to any other media player imo.  It's the only media player I've used for a long time.  

Also for those of you that just hate mkv files like I used to because they sometimes won't delete properly let me tell you this.  The reason this happens is because of an extension in DIVX that bugs them.  With the VLC media player there is no reason to have the DIVX player/codec.  An easy fix to the mkv bug problem is to uninstall DIVX, but for a more surgical fix, you can delete a certain file that I forget atm, just google it.

Anyway complaining and wanting AVI files is so TARDDDDDDDDDD STFU."
