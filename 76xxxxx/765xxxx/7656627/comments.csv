,Mercer99,2012-09-20T22:32Z,"@Zuy
Hate to burst your bubble, but extremezone is one of the most trusted uploaders here. He has never, and probably never will upload a virus. "
[V],extremezone,2012-09-20T22:58Z,it's a false positive if you detect something with your **** av
,SugarGuY,2012-09-21T00:11Z,A total Diablo series ugly bad rip off
,kyuso031,2012-09-21T00:36Z,People Check Tunngle It has a huge community of players and alooot playing torchlight 2 basically what it does is a sort of hamachi+xfire so it shows everyone whos playing and simulates a LAN like hamachi and turns it into where u can see everyones lans and join 
,NetBlaise,2012-09-21T00:42Z,Nice download it works great using it now....flawless.. make sure to disable  virus checker before installing any cracked game..
,Suhteevah,2012-09-21T03:26Z,"@SugarGuY
sorry friend but you are misinformed this is actually ""diablo 4"", you might want to check out what blizzard north was,  blizzard basically stole all of diablo from another company"
,Evilbrobot,2012-09-21T05:05Z,"Where is the crack? When i launch it, It makes me login to steam so where is this crack?"
,Evilbrobot,2012-09-21T05:06Z,"Never mind i found it 
Great upload Works fine!"
,MRAW3S0M3SAUC3,2012-09-21T06:22Z,I don't know why but this has a lot of lag for me. I can play Borderlands 2 with maxed out graphics but this game lags on the lowest graphic settings. Anyone else getting this issue?
,drfrogg,2012-09-21T07:43Z,"Works like a charm.

Thanks for the upload, you are the best!"

DEACTIVATE YOUR ANTIVIRUS BEFORE PLAYING."
,BlitzBandit,2012-09-21T19:41Z,"I'm having the same issue as Evilbrobot. I can't seem to find the crack, and when I launch it, it logs me into steam."
,BlitzBandit,2012-09-21T19:47Z,"Found the crack. For those having the same problem, mount the disc (I.E. using daemon tools). After installation, run the disc again and open files. Dont run installer again. Crack should be there."
,s1raz1,2012-09-21T20:40Z,"any1 knows why movie at intro stutter, i had the same issue when playing crysis 2 and u got those briefing videos, but on crysis 2 i quit and check videos on show room and they show with no stutter at all"

,MikeStanlee1,2012-09-22T01:54Z,"Works like a CHARM ! Sankyu extremezone , great upload ! :) . Everything is working inclduing sound and just everything ! :D .

For those who cant get it working , it might be because you've done something wrong in the instructions or maybe something wrong in the past when installing other programs/games .

This is how I did it : 
1)Download
2)Mount (with Power ISO)
3)Go to Computer and double click the mounted game .
4)Follow the simple steps in installing ( if it asks  you to repair your microsoft redist +2008 or 2010 . Just click yes and repair it .
5)Once done installing , go to my computer and right-click the mounted game , click open .
6) Then , you must be seeing a folder called 'Crack' . Open it and copy all its contents to your directory .
7)Now , create a shortcut if u like and play the game ! :D

Hope I helped you guys :) ."

,OmniNegro,2012-09-27T12:03Z,"I really hope any trolls spamming links to get a ""Free"" copy of the game get banned for that shit. In another torrent one such moron reported that upon doing all the shit for their ""Free"" copy, they were given a torrent. No real game. Just a link to the same fucking thing."
