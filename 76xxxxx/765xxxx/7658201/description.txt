Tomorrowland is organized by IDET, entertainment and media enterprise.
Tomorrowland is held in Belgium as an electronic dance music event (festival) organized every year in the town of Boom since 2005. The first names that showed up were Push (M.I.K.E.), Armin Van Buuren, Cor Fijneman, Yves Deruyter, Technoboy and Coone in that year.

Swedish House Mafia and David Guetta broke chart records and were responsible for a mass hysteria lasting two days and even longer. Tomorrowland sold out days before the event. This edition was again good for a new record, 120,000 visitors over 2 days.
