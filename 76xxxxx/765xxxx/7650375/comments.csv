""These books are great for beginners ... You just need to know the hiragana.""
I don't have any reading material in this package. Or I don't know how to access it. Please explain.

Merci Galinette.
""Ces livres sont vraiment excellents ...Il faut juste connaĂŽtre les hiragana."" 
Quels livres? Soit ils ne sont pas la, soit, je ne sais pas les acceder. Expliquez SVP."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-09-30T16:51Z,"Galinette you have included .DS_Store files which fix your mac viewing preferences. Windows interprets the images to be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. These preferences cannot be changed by Windows Viewer, and the .DS_Store files cannot be deleted. It is screwing up my system. Please do not upload any more folders with .DS_Store files. They are unnecessary to mac users, and extremely irritating to Windows users

Does anyone out there know what to do about it?"
,Galinette,2012-10-03T13:08Z,"Hello! I'm sorry that you can't see the scans. I don't know how to ""take away"" the .DS_Store Files because they are not visible on my computer.
Do you all have problems reading the books?
I'd like this documents to be useful to you so let me know if you can't read them."
