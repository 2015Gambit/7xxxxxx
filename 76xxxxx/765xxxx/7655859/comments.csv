clearly you have no idea about how scene groups like 2HD, LOL, ASAP, etc release things. They come in .rar files. The reason is so that they can be uploaded to their hosts (and usenet) easily. Releasing in .rar has been the scene standard for tv since the late 1990s. 

This is simply not un-extracted. "
