Thanks BOZX."
,Berserker1982,2012-09-29T02:33Z,"doesn't include what it says it includes, and titles aren't fully labeled. Nice failure."
,Berserker1982,2012-09-29T02:40Z,"Guy burned them all together and recklessly/vaguely labeled them... Quality is great, but good luck figuring what's what,"
,Berserker1982,2012-09-29T02:42Z,"So yes, seems like it ""includes"" what it says...but in a mish mosh. 

I didn't mean ""burned"" I meant ripped.

And quit with any ""what've you uploaded"" ...it doesn't take away from the mess this DL causes if you're trying to label them. You have to play and scan the friggen clips to see what ones are included. IE: the guy threw 3 clips into a file called ""Shrek""...

Whatever, carry on..."
