VHS Rip : English, 61mins 36secs. This is a redo of my other torrent to reduce file size.

the East Side Kids in Bowery Champs - 1944

Featuring Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, Billy Benedict, Gabriel Dell, Jimmy Strand & Buddy Gorman.

A murder mystery. Bobby Jordan appears in uniform & uses his real name in the flick, Bobby was in the service at this point, must of been on leave or something. Gabriel Dell plays a role outside of the gang.

Good flick. Also, Leo's dad Bernard Gorcey plays a cabbie
