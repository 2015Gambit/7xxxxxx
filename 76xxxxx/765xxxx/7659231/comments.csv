This section is called FLAC, not lossless, so anything uploaded here should be in FLAC format.

You could have easlily converted it first, but now every person who downloads this will have to convert it themselves."

Thank you so very much for a normal comment ! Hope your neighbors liked the cd :) Track number 7 is better than one remembers :)"
