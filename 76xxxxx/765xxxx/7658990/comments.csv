,Poopsickel,2012-09-22T10:12Z,Nevermind. Make sure you run it and the game as Admin. That works

,prodhrider,2012-10-01T08:14Z,doesnt work :( tried to run it as admin both the game and trainer but nothing :/ does it matter the game? as if its skidrow or anything else?
,DMS1960,2012-10-01T12:36Z,Nothing wrong with the torrent itself but it is not compatible with the latest version of BL2 1.0.35.4707
