That old BitComet crap that you are using has been obsolete for many years.


And hopefully, when you grow older and wiser, you will become smart enough to create individual, properly named torrents for each movie that you wish to share, instead of dumping them into a non-descript grab bag the way you did here.

And if you some day become really smart, you may even search the site first, before creating a torrent, to see if the item that you are planning to share is already being adequately shared by existing torrents."
