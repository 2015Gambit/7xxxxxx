I am hearing numbers like ""48 episodes"", which puts us a little less than halfway through so far.  We'll see.  When the whole series is complete I will try to do a rough site-rip & grab each of their extra videos so as to offer one comprehensive collection.

As of right now I am seeding continuously from my phone and very occasionally from a laptop via wifi.  Best I can do until I'm out of the hospital bed.

Please help seed as I'm not very fast from 3G!"
