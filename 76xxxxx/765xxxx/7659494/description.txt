As she did in her critically acclaimed The Last Days of the Romanovs, Helen Rappaport brings a compelling documentary feel to the story of this royal marriage and of the queenΓÇÖs obsessive love for her husband ΓÇô a story that began as fairy tale and ended in tragedy.

After the untimely death of Prince Albert, the queen and her nation were plunged into a state of grief so profound that this one event would dramatically alter the shape of the British monarchy. For Britain had not just lost a prince: during his twenty year marriage to Queen Victoria, Prince Albert had increasingly performed the function of King in all but name. The outpouring of grief after AlbertΓÇÖs death was so extreme, that its like would not be seen again until the death of Princess Diana 136 years later.

Drawing on many letters, diaries and memoirs from the Royal Archives and other neglected sources, as well as the newspapers of the day, Rappaport offers a new perspective on this compelling historical psychodrama--the crucial final months of the princeΓÇÖs life and the first long, dark ten years of the QueenΓÇÖs retreat from public view. She draws a portrait of a queen obsessed with her living husband and ΓÇô after his death ΓÇô with his enduring place in history. Magnificent Obsession will also throw new light on the true nature of the princeΓÇÖs chronic physical condition, overturning for good the 150-year old myth that he died of typhoid fever
