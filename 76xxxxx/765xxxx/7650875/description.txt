Synopsis - After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, 
only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days.

This is the Korean movie Oldboy with hardcoded English subtitles. I figured I couldn't be the 
the only person out there that streams their files and hates it how the sub files do not get picked 
up. This was done as a request. And I must say it seems like a good movie.
