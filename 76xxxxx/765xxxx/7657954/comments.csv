By the way, will you be returning to SU?"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-21T17:18Z,"@.xDEADx.: Nope. All current BluRay rips are upscale of unknown source and home-made DTS from AC3 of iTunes version or DVD. True Blu-Ray would have new encryption nobody claims to crack it.

@jawick: I never left SU. I am just enjoying retirement."
