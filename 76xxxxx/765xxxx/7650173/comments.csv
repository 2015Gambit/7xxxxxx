Any chance of the update2 that fixes the autosave bug, this shit has been happening since F1 2010 and they still cant sort it out, first with GFWL and now Steam. Useless Tossers. 
And then they wonder why we pirate their games. This is happening with most games now, if they put more effort into developing the game instead of security to try and stop a few people (that would never buy the game anyway) pirating it then we might just have a little fuckin faith and spend our hard earnt on their products. As it stands, the only people who spend good money and something that doesn't work are not wired up right."
