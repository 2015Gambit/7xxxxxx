-
As fighting rages in the streets of Syria's largest city, FRONTLINE Producer Jamie Doran and Correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad journey to the heart of the insurgency, inside the rebel groups that are waging a full-scale assault on the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Within "liberated zones" near the city of Aleppo, the rebels not only fight the Syrian Army, but struggle against each other in a bitter rivalry between secular and Islamist fighters. The Battle For Syria is an unprecedented portrait of Syria's rebel leaders, the toll of the war on civilians, and the outlines of a potential struggle for power in post-Assad Syria.

Also this hour, a look inside The House of Assad.
