Just run the fix file as admin and follow the instructions.

Installed fine, activated until 2014-01-01.
Updates are working!

Solid job mate! One of the best installers for AV I have come across.

No failsafe mode required, no unplugging the internet. No alternative update servers.
Easy breezy!"

MANY MANY THANKS to the guys behind this, from crackers to uploaders to seeders.
