,ZeroCast,2012-09-19T23:39Z,"Long time no see mate. 

Great to have you back on-board, and thanks for torrent :)."
[M],Hero,2012-09-19T23:50Z,"Also, uploader bumped to VIP. Should have done that long ago... our bad :P "
[V],readyman,2012-09-20T00:30Z,"Thx Hero for the VIP...I missed my green skull lol. And I would appreciate honesty to the fullest extent regarding this torrent. I am currently playing it as we speak, so I know it works. I dont know how far into the game it works, I have not played that far into the game but I know it works thus far, with all the sound and voices."
[V],readyman,2012-09-20T03:27Z,"Sorry if people are getting slower speeds. I am uploading with no other network applications running, so I am doing my best to seed. Please help me get this great torrent out there and help me seed. =)"
,Hellspawned,2012-09-20T04:45Z,Uploading @ 10Mbps but it would be higher if i recieved faster. getting around 400kbps :-/
[V],readyman,2012-09-20T05:08Z,"Sorry about hte low speeds. I do not run a seedbox. Just my home PC at 1Mb/s. =(

But I will seed this file as long as I need. =D"
,hsouiri1,2012-09-20T06:55Z,Is it possible to play co-op in this version?
[V],readyman,2012-09-20T07:28Z,"@ hsouiri1:

I am pretty sure multiplayer does not work in this release. I can not say for sure, because I have not tried so you might be surprised and it may work.

I think the possibility of LAN gameplay via co-op may work. But again, I have not tried, so I cannot say for sure."
,Fashow,2012-09-20T14:40Z,"Does this version include the cut scenes?
What is ripped from this exactly langs?"
,BoxTheSuicid3,2012-09-20T18:49Z,no seed? why not? please seed
[V],readyman,2012-09-20T21:48Z,"@Fashow

So far, all the cut scenes are there, and I cannot notice anything ripped. I did not rip anything.

@BoxTheSuicid3
I am seeding at full speeds. I am doing my best."
,Will1989,2012-09-20T23:58Z,"Every time I try to open it "" the application has failed to start because MSVCR100.dll was not found"" any Ideas?"
,Will1989,2012-09-21T00:39Z,Nvm I figured it out. Thanks readyman! Took a day to download but the game works great!
,PorlyHung,2012-09-21T00:39Z,"This is legit folks.  Works great!

,Renoloz,2012-09-22T15:44Z,"To change the name go to the folder you extracted->Binaries->Win32 and open 3DMGame in Notepad. Change ""PlayerName =Jason"" to whatever you want and save."
,RKas8592,2012-09-22T20:01Z,"Hey readyman, I'm having a problem very similar to Will. the dll file I have missing is 'XINPUT1_3.dll'. Do I use the same link?"
[V],readyman,2012-09-22T21:14Z,"RKas8592: I am pretty sure that the DLL you speak of is actually missing due to Games For Windows Live not being either; a) Installed and/org b)properly configured. You can try the link below and download just the DLL, but I recommend downloading and installing GFWL.

GFWL Link:

DLL Link:

Hope this helps.

,Cpt_Skooma,2012-09-23T01:41Z,"Can anyone please answer this:

Does this BL2 torrent include co-op (online, not LAN)?

I really want to know. And thank you, @readyman, for the torrent. :)"
[V],readyman,2012-09-23T04:05Z,"@Cpt_Skooma: I do believe this will work co-op online. I know it will work via LAN because I have tried it myself. But online, I am not positive.

also for multi char accounts, when you run out of keys just change log back

[GoldenKeys]

+NumKeys=999

Notice the 254  (just change that number back and forth 254 to 253 to 254. Every time you do you should have a new sum of keys,( over 200 )
