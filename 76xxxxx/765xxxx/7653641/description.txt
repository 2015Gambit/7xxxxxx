Hey there TPB. It has been a long time since I have UP'ed anything. However, when I saw these files, I compiled them together and noticed, I accidentally made a Directplay of Borderlands 2. 

This game is TESTED and WORKING, WITH VOICES and Working Crack. Simply extract and play.

Install Notes:

1 - Extract to desired location, 

2 - Go to the "New Game Folder" > Binaries > Win32 > Borderlands 2.exe to play

Notes:
Make sure all your directx and video frivers are current, as this is a new release.

How I built this:

I usedc the following torrent files to make this release, and take no credit for anything except compiling them together and finding the torrents to compile it.

Game File:
Borderlands.2.STEAM.UNLOCKED-P2P 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7648821/Borderlands.2.STEAM.UNLOCKED-P2P

Crack File:
Borderlands 2 Crack Only Fixed-3DM 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7649447/Borderlands_2_Crack_Only_Fixed-3DM

Voice File:
Borderlands 2 - English Sound FILES 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7649779/Borderlands_2_-_English_Sound_FILES

** Everything works as long as you extract the files to a location on your hard drive, have all of ypour drivers up-to-date.

I take no credit for the production and/or uploading of any of the files I used to make this directplay, all credit goes to the original uploaders and authors.

Happy 9 year anniversary TPB, and keep on keepin' on! Long live TPB and ALL of us pirates!
