The lessons in this e-book were written on a variety of Bible study topics, that were taught over the years by T.O.D. Johnston at Paran Baptist Church, in Lake City, SC. All lessons are dedicated for knowledge, understanding, and inspiration as we seek to follow Our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. A comprehensive range of Bible study topics are covered, including Christian living and prayer, Christian history, the nature of Christ and the Holy Bible, and Biblical prophecy.
