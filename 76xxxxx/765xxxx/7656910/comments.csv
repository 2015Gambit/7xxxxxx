I tried to open this with Demon Tools, and it tried to play it like a DVD. I tried iso buster and it gave a DVD format - AUDIO, VIDEO (With VOB file) and SYSTEMU with XEX format files. I am no Noob at this, having opened hundreds of games, but I never seen anything like this. Anyone know if this is real, or how to open this??"

My apologies!!"
