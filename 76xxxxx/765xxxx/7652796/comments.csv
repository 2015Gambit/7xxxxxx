I've given you the link and assured you all your old games will work.. install 3.55 and be done with it."
,super1313,2012-09-21T04:58Z,"nah thats ok, still staying on 3.41, but thanks"
,dududus,2012-09-22T02:22Z,"No probs..

If you want to check which fixes will work on 3.41, download 

aldostools 

(do a google search) then load the eboot or pkg into it and it will tell you 3.40 or 3.41 or 3.55"
