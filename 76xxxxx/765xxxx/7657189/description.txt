nowhere in the long run. If you graduate as 

an engineer, when your bridges collapse 

or as a doctor when your patients have an 

ugly tendency to die on you.



But in the meantime, fool yourself that you 

are a straight A until they expel your sorry 

ass into the real world.





I can seed for a short time only, please 

keep alive by seeding. Thanks.
