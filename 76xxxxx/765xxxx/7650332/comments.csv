Oh, but there is nothing spooky about me being inside your head. You yourself told in the beginning somewhere it all started for you with Cerebus.
So seeing what you do, and knowing your starting point, then it is only 1+1 and you got 2. :-)

By the way, for me it started about 10 years earlier then you, in a country that may only have 10 people that ever read Cerebus. So I can not say it all started at the same point. :-)

THANKS!!!!!!!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-19T05:22Z,"First of all, WOW! I need to proofread before I post these things. Geez.

Yeah blattsucker, but you see, by that logic I would have to be assuming that ANYBODY is actually reading ANYTHING I post with these books. Assuming is dangerous. In fact, I think it's probably more safe to assume that most people just see a title they like, maybe look at the size of the download and number of files and get to clickin'. So, ya know, thanks for reading AND for putting 1 + 1 together. 

Wow. Wherever you are, or were when you first read Cerebus, it's cool that it made it that far!"
,blattsucker,2012-09-19T16:38Z,"Hahahaha, never underestimate the power of your words, before you know we will use them against you. :-)
And then you in a world of hurt......... or better up to your neck in scanning and restoring.

I am from the country where there never realy was an underground. It was always aboveground, only not very mainstream.
All the underground artists wanted to come here and most did one time or an other.
And as a bonus my country blocked TPB.
Can you guess how far I am away? :-)
By the way, do you also have the COMPANION and other stuff outside the series that is from Dave's hand? I have already the older stuff from before issue 300 was published (the Epic, portfolio, diamondback and such).

Thanks"
,blattsucker,2012-09-19T19:19Z,"PS, I am on holiday now, so that is why I am able to come on TPB. (I hope the EXE file for getting around the blockade works when I get home.)
It also is why i thought it was named ""Cerebus companion"". I should have said ""Cerebus Archive"" and ""Following Cerebus"".
So talking about ""assuming"" and I deliver it to you on a platter. :-)"
,nbrazil,2012-09-23T09:06Z,"Don't give up on Dave Sim. Although greatly lacking in digital skills himself, he has assembled a team to convert all of his past material to digital form for sale on the Kindle and other platforms. It is being funded through a Kickstarter project. This greatly changes the logistics, meaning a fortune doesn't have to be sunk into printing books before they can be sold.

On this basis it's possible Glamourpuss could be resurrected."
,aboynamedcrow,2012-09-23T16:39Z,"Thanks for the upload! I love Sim's stuff. I have a request: do you have Cerebus#26?

Thanks!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-04T09:35Z,"nbrazil, have you read his statement at the end of Glamourpuss 26? I've been reading Dave's stuff on a monthly, or as released basis since 1982 and I can say with certainty that I've never seen the same tone come through in his writing. He seems really defeated, which is not something I ever expected from him. He's always been very, ""screw everyone, I'm going to do whatever I want, however I want to do it"". I'm beginning to wonder if cutting ties with so many people and refusing to budge even an inch on any of his opinions (when the world around him changes on a minute by minute basis) might finally have pushed him to a place that just isn't making sense (which is saying a lot, because that's one advanced thinking, high quality mind right there). 

Also, there was, evidently, a MAJOR setback with the production of the High Society digital version. They're still pushing forward and hopefully all will end well, because those books are going to be something completely different from what has been done with the digital comics medium in the past (Dave once again building doors, just so he can knock them down and never look back). But even if they're successful there's very little chance that they'll create some kind of new fortune. The best we can hope for is that they make enough to keep Dave from dropping completely out of site with enough left over to move on to producing the next digital book (and lets hope it continues that way for quite some time).

What MIGHT bring him some additional income is if he takes Fantagraphics up on the ""offer"" to do higher quality, contextualized reprints of the phone books. But that didn't sound very likely, either. 

Honestly, as much as you can ""care"" about a stranger (whose mind has been poured out on paper and ingested, repeatedly, for 2/3 of my life), I just hope the guy can find a way to be happy and comfortable for the rest of his life. I don't really care what he ends up doing professionally or personally if he can find that.
