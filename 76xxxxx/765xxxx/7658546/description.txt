Requirements: Android 1.5+, Rooted devices
Overview: This is the paid version, with no ads and unlimited dictionaries - try the free version first and make sure you like everything before purchasing!


GoldenDict is a multi-format dictionary program with reach formatting, colors, images and sounds. It fully supports a lot of popular dictionary formats. You can now carry all the dictionaries you want together with you on your Android device!

Supported formats:
* Lingoes .LD2 files
* Babylon .BGL files
* ABBYY Lingvo .LSD, .DSL, .LSA and .DAT files
* StarDict files
* Dictd files
* Hunspell .AFF/.DIC morphology files

Just copy those files on your SD card, in the GoldenDict directory!

Features:

* All content is shown in full formatting, with images and sounds. We don't compromise on quality.
* It's fast. It flies when you have a dozen of dictionaries, and can handle hundreds of dictionaries simultaneously fairly well, too.
* The program will understand your typing no matter how you do it - forget about diacritics, case or punctuation!
* In-program popup mode is supported. Configure your e-book reader to use "ColorDict 3" as your dictionary interface, and GoldenDict will pop up.
* Translating from clipboard is easy - just press and hold "Search" button on your device!

This is a full, paid version. It has no ads and can support an unlimited amount of dictionaries!

An option to highlight stressed letters with a different color added (for Lingvo dictionaries). Some Bgl files which could not be indexed before can now be indexed.
