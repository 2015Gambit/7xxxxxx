                        DESCRiPTiON 

 If you've ever had an idea to make money, Dragons' Den is THE show to watch. 
 All manner of money-spinning minds will step into the intimidating world of 
 business financing, determined to make their dreams come true. All they need is 
 the cash. To get this, they must face the Dragons, all of whom are formidable 
 business thinkers with the money to make things happen.

 But this is no lottery - the contestants will need all their powers of 
 reasoning, presentation and persuasion to convince our five business experts 
 that theirs is a product worth investing in. The Dragons know what makes a 
 successful idea, how much it's worth and how much cash is needed to get it off 
 the ground.

 * Each business (pitcher) can pitch for a specified amount of funding for their 
 idea or product.

 * If the pitcher can convince one or more of the Dragons to meet that specified 
 amount (usually in exchange for shares of their company), the pitcher walks 
 away with the cash.

 * If the pitchers find themselves short of the specified amount of funding, 
 they lose it all.

 * Each pitcher is free to bargain with the Dragons in order to get the 
 specified level of funding.                                                 
                                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
