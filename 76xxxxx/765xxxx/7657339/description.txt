Overview: Forest GO LuancherEX Theme

It was a full of vitality and hope. In later years, it may be more deeply felt its precious. When reinforced with the original jungle, when mechanical lets the human feel short of convenience, when our life, our traffic, heavy industry, war foul its original appearance, we are going to what? When you wake up one day, you open your eyes and see no longer green full of vigour, but everywhere concrete jungle. When you feel helpless, hopeless, unable to breathe, the dawn of forest in hand, let the crystal music to accompany you to stick to the soul of the pure land.
