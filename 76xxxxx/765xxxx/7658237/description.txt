

At the beginning you have enough time to take care about the landed aircraft. Once the aircraft has been assigned to an airport gate workload will increase immensely and you will be under considerable strain. You have to steer all vehicles such as boarding stairs, baggage carts, fuel trucks etc. Even the maintenance crews are within your responsibility.

 

Only who is planning tactical clever and forward looking will reach the goal - up to eight planes have to be handled simultaneously. Realistic announcements, rumbling engine sound as well as changing weather conditions create a fascinating atmosphere which is familiar to you from the airports all over the world.


For taking care of the ongoing flow of landing aircrafts you will get paid. Depending on your efficiency in fulfilling tasks without delay you will be able to hire workforce for vehicles and dedicated tasks at the gates. Based on your success the airport will slowly but surely move into an automated operation. Your role changes from a worker to the airport manager.
