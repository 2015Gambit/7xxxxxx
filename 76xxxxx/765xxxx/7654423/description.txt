The Kodak Preps imposition software is a prepress tool that you use to
create press-run layouts for bound-work impositions and ganged flat
work. You can work ΓÇ£on the flyΓÇ¥ in an interactive workspace, use stored
templates for frequently repeated layouts, and print the production
output to common file formats. Preps also supports varying degrees of
workflow automation.
You can impose PDF input files or unpopulated job pages for sheetfed
or web press-run layouts, and send the output to any PostScriptcompatible
device such as a computer-to-plate (CTP) device,
imagesetter, on-demand printer, digital printer, wide-format imposition
proofer, or laser printer.
The Preps software is used in standalone PDF environments, as well as
in all popular workflow solutions, including Kodak Prinergy systems and
third-party (Agfa┬« ApogeeX, RampageΓäó, Global Graphics Harlequin┬«,
Artwork Systems NexusΓäó, and Dainippon┬« Screen Dainippon Screen
TrueFlow┬«) software systems.
