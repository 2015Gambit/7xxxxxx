,issa1982,2012-09-20T23:26Z,"sorry QborT but you obviously don't know YIFY
it is brrip and a dame good one
keep up the good work yify 1+"
,dandalis,2012-09-21T00:26Z,"seriously YIFY, u need to improve audio quality man, cuz video is great, but audio ruins it."
,QborT,2012-09-21T00:48Z,"Nope, you all are wrong and I am right.  The only 1080p source out at the moment is BRADJE's and that is still just an upscale of the WEB-DL.

But feel free to continue to cry and rant about my superior knowledge, I find it delightful."
,CrematoryKid,2012-09-21T01:21Z,i believe that having this video quality with 1.something gb is good even with this audio
,dumbson,2012-09-21T02:44Z,WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO DOWNLOAD DAMMITT?!?!?!
,pReStOn_C,2012-09-21T02:45Z,"@QborT - WTF ... who gives a flying toss what you think and get's off on other people's remark's because you find it amusing... Superior knowledge my ass! Can you even prove your so called superior knowledge..? Maybe your superior knowledge derives from the shit that dribbles out of your mouth perhaps, and that you majority share's in a Toilet paper factory to wipe that shit from your gushing dribbling mouth!"
,fiberoptica,2012-09-21T03:55Z,"Hahaha superior knowledge?? I have seen no demonstration of that at all.
@Qbort the only thing you seem superior at is sucking it dry you fucking wanker. Usually when some asshole says that its the opposite times 10 to the third power."
,chimaera1337,2012-09-21T05:26Z,Stuck at 86.4%. Need more seeders.
,logic0409,2012-09-21T05:45Z,300 seeds and none connected dl 5kb up 560kb at least some of you will get it before i do. so please return favor and seed. 
,toomb1979,2012-09-21T06:36Z,"I had to register just to say people should be more grateful. You come to this site to preview free movies before you buy them, and other people work really hard to get those files, make them watchable, and then seed them on here for you... FOR FREE! How immature do you have to be? I mean seriously?! 

If you're going to make a comment say something like this: 

""Hey YIFY, I love your rips man they're always a great picture in a small package... But I've noticed that the surround sound suffers because of the smaller size and all, which I completely understand, it's really one or the other when it comes to "
,toomb1979,2012-09-21T06:43Z,I have noticed with the smaller file size on these HQ rips that the audio suffers significantly. It isn't noticeable when watching on a TV or something but through a nice surround sound stereo the center channel (and therefore the dialogue) can be really muted. You can spend the whole movie trying to adjust the sound. :) Keep up the good work!
,toomb1979,2012-09-21T06:52Z,"Crap, sorry about the double post, at first it didn't show up and I thought it was a glitch... I'll cancel my registration in shame."
,oldtimer48,2012-09-21T07:31Z,"@toomb1979, you were right about one thing; being grateful. Have you tried turning up the volume on your surround sound?"
,ramble128,2012-09-21T07:32Z,"A legit 1080p would be in the range of 10/15GB if you wanna download that go ahead. But for a 2GB file the quality you cant bitch about if you think the quality sucks BUY THE RETAIL you wont get better.

If you want perfect quality audio/video buy the retail for £15 otherwise say cheers yify for the effort,and be grateful that hes took the time to rip,compress,upload."
,logic0409,2012-09-21T08:47Z,99.5% almost there... still 0 health and my up is 100x my dl. please help us all and seed....
,punx_roxer,2012-09-21T09:14Z,thank you YIFY you truley are a god among men in the digital piracy world!

notice the fox logo color and the movie and compare it to others its really bluish

when i got dvdrip i didnt watch because of that now i think its the movie default and im glad im going to watch it with this quality

thanks again yify "
,peahimaui,2012-09-21T15:38Z,I am very sorry to say this because I love YIFY's work but the audio is just not worthy of the film and YIFY's visual quality :( Can you please re-upload this with good audio? Cheers :)
,cocoathunder,2012-09-21T16:13Z,lol people criticizing FREE media STFU and go buy it if you have such problems.
,Jizocom,2012-09-21T16:23Z,We love you YIFY!
,leelee421,2012-09-21T20:49Z,YIFY SPIDER MAN 3 please!! 
,Eliotmess,2012-09-21T21:51Z,thx YIFY! just wanted to know why the small size if this is 1080p and why are sample pictures 1.280×528 pixels ?
,JediNinjaTurtle,2012-09-21T23:19Z,YIFY PLZ UPLOAD MOONRISE KINGDOM!!!!!!
,18p00p,2012-09-22T05:42Z,"Is this in Surround sound, or Stereo or ?????

,Doom789X,2012-09-22T06:31Z,How is audio sync on PS3?
,FRivera,2012-09-22T15:23Z,Quality of video is crazy good - 10. Audio not terrible but not great.
,Risko.,2012-09-22T20:32Z,"Aww come on....If you want better audio just download another brrip, with 6 times bigger size. Seriously you can't have 10V 10A 1080p and size "
,antonisgr,2012-09-22T22:47Z,excellent quality. keep it up yify:)
,Protoss01,2012-09-23T05:27Z,"You are the Man... or woman i dont know.

,Ajube0476,2012-09-23T20:30Z,"Why not post the Video BitRate?
It's ok.. I would be ashamed of it too. "
,the_darkmaster,2012-09-23T20:42Z,"1080p in 1.8GB? Yeah, right... Still waiting a proper one. Seriously guys, a DVD-R have 4.7GB of usable space. Use this."
,kmondo,2012-09-24T01:00Z,"Hey Folks... if I am downloading and activate Constant Seeding and Super Seeding, will that burn off the leech tag? And I guess its proper to leave the file seeding for a few days after the download... yes?"
,blackandblue687,2012-09-24T03:02Z,@the_darkmaster the quality is actually very good and the only reason I download from yifi is because it doesn't take so much space on your hdd; especially when you have hundreds of movies
,Grondaivor,2012-09-24T04:26Z,@the_darkmaster  The codec this file uses is far greater than MPEG-2 which the dvd your describing runs off. Therefore can be more compressed and more easily opened.
,theoffice10,2012-09-24T09:01Z,"Yify, would you PLEASE PLEASE upload CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, the spielberg, di caprio, hanks movie! in 1080p :D"
,PineappleStarz,2012-09-24T09:15Z,"Ajube0476 and the_darkmaster are so stupid it's incredible, please download a brain.

thanks YIFY"
,lovedrum,2012-09-24T12:21Z,thanks YIFY this is cool
,mumbles365,2012-09-24T21:56Z,"I'm a huge YIFY fan and exclusively download torrents from him because of his fast speeds... 

But SOMEOME PLEASE TELL ME why is that this particular torrent is soooooooo slow???? is anyone seeding this? 

"
,mumbles365,2012-09-24T21:59Z,I'M GETTING LIKE 0.9 KBPS ON MY DOWNLOAD WTF GUYS??? ... It refuses to go above that and this is the first time this is happening.
,the_darkmaster,2012-09-25T00:29Z,"@PineappleStarz dumb noob... There is one very important thing called bitrate, and you can not do ""miracles"", ie, quality of 1080p AND small file size. Feel free if a ""pseudo"" 1080p is enough for you, but is not for me."
,pySHtr,2012-09-25T02:21Z,Excellent quality. Thank-you so much! Best movie I've seen in a long time.
,petit_patt,2012-09-25T06:21Z,"thank you very much YIFY, you are the best!"
,weaping_reaper,2012-09-25T06:57Z,"Video quality is Awesome, audio is a little low, but I have nice speakers so I got it up pretty loud, 
And the movie itself was AWESOME!!! I could have gone without the interracial fuck scene, but overall, great torrent."
,MARYUS1010,2012-09-25T15:35Z,"How the heck a 1080p movie can have 2giga? Plus is 2 hours long. For those who have full HD tv, you waste your time! 2 gb is the trailer! :)))"

I know most (if not all) your uploads are 2 channels..but honestly 2 channels doesn't do this movie justice
always grateful nevertheless.. "
