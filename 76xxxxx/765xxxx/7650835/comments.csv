[V],wushdishmeen,2012-09-20T00:18Z,"I don't have time to record anything else.  If you haven't noticed I'm struggling to even get these up.  I'm really busy nowadays and it's getting harder for me to post the show.

This isn't all I do... I run an entire network which offers a lot more than just these 2 shows.  So that takes up all the rest of my time.

Hopefully I will go back to posting the shows at 11AM EST but honestly the Stern Show just isn't as important to me anymore.  Ever since this AGT crap I just haven't been as eager to listen.

But I will continue to provide them."
