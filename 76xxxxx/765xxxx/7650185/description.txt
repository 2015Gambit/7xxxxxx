A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new
vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures,

them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player
co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the
undiscovered and unpredictable living planet.

Features:

Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both
online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling

restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from
any game to any other

World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra
of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose
the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the
perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious
Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the
opening of the Vault.)

Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill
you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious
