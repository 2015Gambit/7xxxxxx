Plot: Crawl is a character-driven thriller set in an unknown, rural town. A seedy 

bar-owner hires a mysterious Croatian to murder an acquaintance over an unpaid debt. 

The crime is carried out, but a planned double-crossing backfires and an innocent 

waitress suddenly becomes involved. Now a hostage in her own home, the young woman 

is driven to desperate measures for survival. A suspenseful, yet darkly humorous 

chain of events builds to a blood-curdling and unforgettable climax.
