[V],twentyforty,2012-09-20T19:46Z,"You should ask earlier. Now, I seed both mp4 (just mp4 from season pack).
If you are member of Sceneunderground site, grab my season torrent from there and take eps you need.
But - now I seed both episodes both here and there."
,chuckbrow,2012-09-21T05:02Z,"Thanks for offering this!  Love the series. The US remake of it was surprisingly good too.

How do I get an invite to SceneUnderground?"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-21T08:37Z,"@chuckbrow: I can send you one. You need gmail account and send me a message on my gmail you can find here in older torrent-descriptions of my uploads, like on Page 30 (I am not repeating it to avoid spam). Or you can use Tweeter and send it to #twentyforty1."
,dkhere,2012-09-22T06:12Z,"HI Can you upload the first three seasons?
I checked in scene underground, and it's not there.."
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-22T09:56Z,Of course is not. It's gone - so as many thousands of old encodes.
,dkhere,2012-09-23T14:00Z,"Oh... Ok... Yeah, i know about it, your hard disk crashing issue. I saw the comments in SU... I think i wil download this one, if something happens to your torrents again.."
