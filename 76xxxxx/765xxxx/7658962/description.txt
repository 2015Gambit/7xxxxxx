REBEL MUSIC VOL. 2: EARLY SESSIONS

This volume was previously available as disc one of Rebel Music Vol 1: early sessions. That set has been restructured
and made available in single volumes because it will be easier to update as upgrades become available.

The collection makes many of the older compilations unnecessary, the other tracks can be found on
official releases and the singles collected by Kazo on his Black Vinyl series.

these tracks

18. Revolution take 2 - mono as above but different mix (4ΓÇÖ30) SantanaΓÇÖs Secret tape

NB. The instrumental is not Talking Blues but is still titled as such in the discography

Tracks marked xx are excluded they are noted as being very similar to official releases and / or have poorer
quality.
Them Belly Full short mix (01-12) has better quality than the similar black vinyl source and has therefore
been included

Fakes:
There are a more than a few fake fan made demos circulating so itΓÇÖs worthwhile to be aware of them. IΓÇÖm not particularly
against fake mixes if they have been done well and I have included one above, Lively Dub Yourself.

Lively Up Yourself is one of the most commonly used tracks for fan made remixes and dubs etc. because itΓÇÖs on the
circulating multi track masters, the remaining are listed below:

Lively Up Yourself dub mix (8'35) fake, long mix with phaser effect -
So Jah Seh dub (4ΓÇÖ29) Ultra rarities
Rebel Music long dub (6ΓÇÖ43) Ultra rarities
Revolution echo mix (4ΓÇÖ03) Authentic demos
