,oldtimer48,2012-09-20T09:20Z,"A/10, V/10, SUBS/10, movie is in French language,  but well worth watching, the subs are easy to read, thank you YIFY "
,.KRAAG.,2012-09-20T10:37Z,"Another movie with an average scene length of 2 seconds. What ever happened to films like Taxi Driver, where the actors were actually good enough to act out a 2 minute scene without fucking it up? Are all the Hollywood film editors these days on meth or something?"
,oldtimer48,2012-09-21T07:37Z,"@.KRAAG, I couldn't resist a further comment, 2 second scenes?  Hollywood Directors, hullo, this is a French movie, and 2 second scenes, I know who is on meth you are missing the plot mate"
,thorkis420,2012-09-28T06:19Z,Yify you damn moron keep it 1280 by 720. 1280 by 544 is NOT 720p. At the very least title it right.
,bananeRoyale,2012-09-30T01:28Z,"thorkis420 you damn moron 720p is a standard for 16:9 ratio with a MAXIMUM of 720 horizontal lines and 1280 vertical ones. This movie has been shoot in 2.35:1 ratio wich mean a resolution of 1280 by 720 would have left 2 black stripes over and under the actual movie and so rise the file size or drop the quality. Using 720 horizontal lines without black stripes would have made it 1692 by 720 wich is not 720p anymore since it's over the maximum resolution.

So best solution to keep it at 720p without rising file size or loosing quality is to make it 1280 by 544.

At the very least you could have inform yourself before insulting people like that."
