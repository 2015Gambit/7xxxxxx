,otnemem,2012-09-19T23:57Z,Another issue where nothing happens. Kirkman sure is learning a lot from the TV seriâ&#x201A;Ź$.
,The Real Chicken,2012-09-20T00:08Z,Thank you!
,wfenriz,2012-09-20T01:53Z,"A search torrent engine reported this as fake, but it's not, I've already downloaded it and read it. It's Ok."
,BlaqkJak,2012-09-20T02:01Z,"Otnemem, leave your reviews for elsewhere. I'd rather read it for myself and find out."
,BlaqkJak,2012-09-20T02:02Z,My laptop isn't recognizing the file type? What should I use for this? 
,bullhatesu,2012-09-20T05:58Z,"FINALLY! this came out a week ago. ussually its posted here in a day, sometimes a few hours. Thank You!"
,Skullbones17,2012-09-20T07:25Z,hey i know this sounds like a noob thing to ask but i'm going to ask it since all i usually get is movies and games on here i downloaded this then tried to open it but its saying acrobat could not open whats the program that i should use to read this thank you and thanks to the uploader i'm sure this is a good torrent
,otnemem,2012-09-20T10:36Z,"BlaqkJak, I get that about spoilers, but a one liner that ruins nothing? Stop being a douche cry baby and shut up."
,FallontheFeg,2012-09-20T14:48Z,"@bullhatesu this did NOT come out weeks ago you moron, this is the latest issue released on 19/9/12. Thanks for this uploader you and mirrormaster are the best source for comics on the bay!"
,craigisthebest,2012-09-20T16:32Z,"Awesome!!!
was waiting for this 
thanks md"
,cvbrian33,2012-09-21T04:20Z,I have tried CDisplay and PDFlite to view this. Not having any good luck with those. What do people use to view on a PC laptop?
,NiqqaPlease,2012-09-21T17:19Z,"To view it I use Comical ^^ Read 1-101 hasn't caused me any trouble.

,cptforge_gil,2012-09-22T09:32Z,"@otnemen
Your a smart dude
Be a doctor or a lawyer and leave us fans be
This torrent is free, so why complain?
Its not like youve published anything that goes under your name
Its funny how burger flippers complain about the works of others and by themselves got nothing else in life
Have a life man!
Go to a community college and start your way up the food chain
Hahhahahaahhaha!!"
,pow.r.pop,2012-09-22T09:32Z,"When will we have some reality shattering event ? Like China was immune and is invading the US for oil and resources ? Or maybe some disease that starts to mutate and turn survivors like Rick and his crew into conscious zombies.....Ones who struggle with the delema of needing living flesh , but have all of their feeling for humanity ....Or even one step further , HIDING it effectively ! 

Seriously though , Kirkman better get his ass in gear. I'm thinking this is a bottom of the barrel comic now"
,motherparker,2012-09-23T01:12Z,OMG THANKS BRO
,engrey,2012-09-23T15:04Z,"comic seems fine to me.
otnemem If he wanted an opinion he'd go to a site that has reviews.
BlaqkJak makes a point. keep it to yourself."
,tufgong,2012-09-23T23:59Z,"Thanks Man!
@pow.r.pop
Shit, you should be writing these graphic novels from now on.  The Walking Dead have been going downhill since episode 89, and quite drastically."
,railgun1,2012-09-24T14:16Z,Thanks!
,pow.r.pop,2012-09-26T10:51Z,"@ tufgong ....

Thanks man , but it's really all just simple story structure. It has to have layers and contrast. Nobody likes ""safe"" small developments, ....at a SLOW Fucking pace that takes a dogs life span to produce anything noteworthy. I hope kirkman is reading this. I would say ((((Seek me out man, I can help, you did good but now it's time for something drastic, Hire me)))

Yeah right , I kid myself , it will be the same predictable shit for another 20- 30 months. We will all be bored by then."
,thadmacracken,2012-09-29T19:32Z,I thank you kind Sir.
,keviner,2012-09-30T02:50Z,"This comic started in 2003, but after 100 issues, less than 2 years has passed for the characters. At this rate, Carl won't see puberty in our lifetime! LOL! 
Frankly, I don't know why people get so fired up about a black-n-white, zzzzzzzzombie soap opera comic, but by God! I will defend your right to read what you like. Let's just not try to make it into more that it really is - a slow paced comic drama, no more or less. Peace. "
