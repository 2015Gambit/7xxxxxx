Editorial Reviews Review

'This innovative, outstanding, and widely used international relations text that uses cinema to address international relations theory is up-dated and improved with a new introduction and additional critical analyses of films addressing global environmental politics. WeberΓÇÖs effective examination of academic theories and political myths through the rhetoric at work in popular films makes this one of the very best texts available today for reaching students in contemporary international relations courses.' - Timothy W. Luke, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University USA

'Refreshingly original, interesting and fun to read, this book will surely encourage students to think critically about international politics' - Roxanne Lynn Doty, Arizona State University, USA

Offers something that has been missing from the critical IR literature ever since its initial formulations over a decade ago: a breakthrough textbook that will allow a much wider audience of undergraduate students to understand how - and, more importantly, why - critical IR asks the sort of questions it does.' - Peter Mandaville,University of Kent UK
