In this workshop author and expert Tim Grey shares techniques for bringing old photos to life, from fixing torn or otherwise damaged areas of a photo to improving the level of detail to adding color where it didnΓÇÖt exist before. YouΓÇÖll learn how to work nondestructively so you never lose important information and how to save your master image with layers intact so you can make more changes down the line.
