,JohnathanDagger,2012-09-20T18:08Z,Thanks for that.
,Noyes86,2012-09-26T21:45Z,"Is this set missing the last part of Small Favor like most of them are? The part where he's out to dinner with Lucio and they discuss his Sight coming in? every collection of the audiobooks I've found so far is missing the end of Small Favor and the only version I've been able to find of just that book that isn't missing it is stuck at 99.9% and it's the whole book as one mp3, so I can't just take the last chapter."
,Noyes86,2012-09-29T23:57Z,Checked it. The end of Book 10 is missing just like every other version I've been able to find. Thanks anyway
