,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T10:11Z,"@.BONE. dude,this PKCMVA guy strait jacked this from you,called it his own then linked it here"
,PKCMVA,2012-09-21T11:23Z,"Really, are you that stupid?

Firstly, If I was going to steal someones torrent I would have renamed it without ViP3R's info included.

I wouldn't have put a link on his original torrent so everyone knows I copied it.

I also included ViP3R's original torrent information so everyone can see it was uploaded from him/her.

And finally, I spent 4 hours of my time re-syncing this movie so others can enjoy the download ViP3R took the time to share with others.

Your a moron, I bet you were happy to leech this download before you wrote this shit.

I fixed the movie you dumb ass. Your too young to have a computer, go play with your dolls. "
,ekkyjc,2012-09-21T16:42Z,owned.

,Savre,2012-09-23T04:17Z,"Its a pretty good film. 

It has some annoying parts and as an English dub its quite horrible because the lip-synch doesn't add up 9 times out of 10 and they look so fucking weird with moving lips and out of place dialogue. 

Its hard to place this film as well. I'm not sure if its meant to fit in with the first two films or not. It looks like it could have occurred after Degeneration but it could have also occurred before it. It doesn't really matter but it would be nice if they fit together with the games. 

A/V = 9 M = 7"
,kreverwas,2012-09-24T00:20Z,Thanks .BONE.!
