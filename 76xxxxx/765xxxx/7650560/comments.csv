In the older versions (till 9.0.x) none Keygen or crack was able to make this remarkable piece of software to work more than about 60 days.

All images were flipped or watermarked after a time period. I suspect keygen and other shit were published from the same WebSite creator to make guys like you, use this software in time and then inevitable force you buy this software. Nice idea but why not buy this software from the beginning?  

Inevitable youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;ll do if you like and continue using it. Mark my wordsâ&#x20AC;Ś"
