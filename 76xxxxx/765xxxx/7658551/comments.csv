,newtab,2012-09-21T15:56Z,"dear rkstr
thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks :) sincerely, for all the people who cant watch in other way, i very much deeply appreciate you taking the time and effort to share, and im real grateful to you and all uploaders.
i realize most people dont actually say thank you, but im sure they feel grateful too, because it would suck to not have uploaders and translators and the ones keeping the websites and all, but unfortunatelly the internet is full of big mouths who think some must do things out of duty instead of the generosity or whatever reason that moves them.
thank you again, and bless you."
,abdorayi,2012-09-21T16:05Z,"I remember the one comment... ""You really are a rockstar!"" very appropriate :)
