Louis Riel is a 2003 historical biography in comics by Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown. It deals with Métis rebel leader Louis Riel's antagonistic relationship with the newly established Canadian government. It begins shortly before the 1869 Red River Rebellion, and ends with Riel's 1885 hanging for high treason. The book explores the possibly schizophrenic aspect of Riel's personality—he believed God had named him Prophet of the New World, destined to lead the Métis people to freedom.

The work is noted for its emotional disengagement, its intentionally flat dialogue, and a minimalist drawing style inspired by Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie. Unusual in comics of the time, it includes a full scholarly apparatus: a foreword, index, bibliography and end notes. The appendix provides insight on Brown's creative process and biases, highlighting where he changed historical facts to create a more engaging story, such as incorporating a conspiracy theory not widely accepted by historians. Brown became interested in the issue of property rights while researching the book, which led to a very public change in his politics from anarchism to libertarianism.

Although Brown intended it to be published in book form only, Louis Riel was initially serialized in ten issues between 1999 and 2003. It was the first comic book to receive a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts. It was critically well received, winning three Harvey Awards. The serialization sold poorly, but the book version was a surprise bestseller, and its success played a major part in gaining shelf space for serious graphic novels in mainstream North American bookstores.
