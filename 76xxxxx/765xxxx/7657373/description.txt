Artist: Green Day
Title: American Idiot
Release Date: 2004

This is a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 conversion, in AVCHD format, created from the 24/96 HDTracks stereo source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

To play the full lossless 24/96 stream, you must utilize a Blu-Ray player and receiver capable of decoding a DTS-MA signal. Those without a DTS-MA receiver will still be able to play a 24/48 core DTS stream.

For those who cannot play a disc in AVCHD, there is brief document included in this torrent as to my own process in extracting mono wavs from discs like these in order to create a disc in another multichannel format.

Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Is it possible this album sounds better eight years later? I think so. The hi-rez stereo shines as source and, although the level of instrumental separation does vary a bit from track to track, it feel great to be surrounded by this album no matter what.
