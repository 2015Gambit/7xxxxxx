,Paul-mc,2012-09-23T03:14Z,"This application has such a small interface that it’s almost useless for any practical work.

If you decide to install it anyway on your jailbroken iPad, you can do it in a much easier way than the one shown.

1.	Just open iTunes and open Windows Explorer in a separate window.

2.	Double click the ipa file in Windows Explore and it will pop up as an application in iTunes.

3.	In iTunes, click the ‘Apply’ button and it will update your iPad"
