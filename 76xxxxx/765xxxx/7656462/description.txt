Architect Leo Waters&#x27; marriage is in trouble, his wife Julia unhappy. Their son Martin drops out of college; he&#x27;s home, adrift and out of sorts with Leo. Daughter Christina has entered her mid-teens with a new body and new feelings. Enter Tonya Neely, a community organizer who lives in high-rise public housing Leo designed years&#x27; before. The residents want the projects razed; she comes to Leo asking him to sign her petition. He&#x27;s put off; Julia supports Tonya. Martin goes to see for himself and begins a friendship with homo-erotic potential. In the meantime, Christina puts herself at risk seeking affirmation. High pitched emotions and high-rise apartments: what will collapse first?
