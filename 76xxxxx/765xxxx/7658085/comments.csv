(b) awesome, awesome upload Radurall... simple in install, works perfectly. I have absolutely no clue why anyone would vote this down... Many thanks!"
,crystal_fan_01,2012-09-23T22:04Z,"Heheh... they deleted the previous comment (good!)... so feel free to click on the link above now, that one is solid.

About 1/2 way through the game, still solid, works perfectly. If you like Diablo 2, you'll love this game."

,Xylar08,2012-09-29T09:54Z,This works perfectly and a very simple installation. You can expect torrents from nosTEAM to be wonderful. I agree with crystal_fan_01 with why people would downvote this.
