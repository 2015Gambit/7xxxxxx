Witness for the Prosecution [1957]

Agatha Christie tale of a man on trial for murder: a trial featuring
surprise after surprise

MY COMMENT: Charles Laughton (eminent as Sir Wilfrid Robarts) together with his
wife Elsa Lanchester, Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power in a story that
surprises you all the time. Excellent acting from excellent actors. Director
Billy Wilder shows his versatility. His next film came to be "Some Like It Hot"
one of the best comedies ever. No wonder he won 6 Oscars.
This film was nominated for six Oscars and won none. Surprising? Well, the
competition was hard this year with films as “Bridge on the River Kwai" (Alec
Guiness) and “Twelve Angry Men”. Enjoy!
