,macstar2012,2012-09-19T06:41Z,"It is not a virus..It is a false positive. Almost all anti virus programs will detect such things as a keygen or any crack tool as a virus. So for anyone else looking for this, it is clean..:) "
,macstar2012,2012-09-19T07:01Z,"@Ridgerover
You will need to add a 1 time exception to your anti virus program in order for the keygen to run correctly as the false positive that is showing as a virus (Which it is not) is preventing the program from working correctly. Here some TBP info..
When using TPB please read these important notes:

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them."

The best thing to do is to download the trial version from the official Avg website. Once you have downloaded it and during install you will see a serial that is already there, at this point use the keygen and just pick which edition you want and then generate the Serial and copy the serial and past it over the serial that is already there then continue on. The installer will download all files automatically according to the edition and serial you have selected. If you still have issues after this by all means hit me back..Hope that helps:)  "

,Cassie2,2012-09-23T02:01Z,"Hello! 

When I click on the application it says ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."" 

And once I 'do' get it open, if I can, do I have to download a new copy of AVG or can I just add the key to the one I have now that is telling me it is expired? 

Thank you in advance! :) "

Please give any instructions for a complete computer illiterate, because I am :-D

You will need to open your anti virus program depending on your anti virus program i noted you said you have Avg already so when you download this torrent and when the file is complete if you see a virus detection pop up and wanting you to delete a file, select ignore as it is a false positive (See below messages for false positive info) Now open your Avg Anti virus and you will need to add a exception for the downloaded file Here is a small tutorial on adding exceptions with avg.

I hope this helps:)"
,Cassie2,2012-09-23T18:21Z,"Thank you Macstar2012! So far so good! :) 

The only thing is, I had a whole list of Keys from (that place that is presently closed and may or may not come back ;) ) and every time I entered a new key, a few days later I would get the message again that my license had expired :( -- but the first one 'did' last for several months, for which I was very happy! :) Hopefully, this one lasts til 1218! :-D And HOPEFULLY, you'll be around after that! :-D 

Thanks again, Macstar! :) "
,Cassie2,2012-09-23T18:25Z,"Oh, by the way, what do I use for the username? "
,Cassie2,2012-09-23T18:44Z,"Um, that should be 2018! lol. I was thinking of 2012 and 2018 and my brain musta been confused! :-D 

And should I leave the username that I originally got the first keygens for, or enter a new one, or? So far, I just left that username there and just entered the new key. 

And I just entered the key on the copy of AVG that I already had - I hope that's ok and won't cause problems. 

Thanks! :) "
,Cassie2,2012-09-23T21:55Z,"Grrrr. After updating the license and telling me it was good until 2018, it is now ALREADY again telling me the licence is expired and is giving me the same 26 days deadline as I had before :-| 

Thanks if you can help, Macstar! :) "

Update: 
Ok, I just re-entered another key and this time, I deleted the username that I was given from (that place that is closed now) and put in macstar2012. I hope that is what I was supposed to do? And that it will stay registered now? 

I wish there was a way we could talk in email instead of here. I do not use any of the chat programs and prefer not to. And it doesn't look like there is one for members here on TPB. 

Thanks again! :) "

As far as i know there shouldn't be a user name needed, possibly in the older versions there may be, but Avg 2013 which can be downloaded here http://www.avg.com/us-en/internet-security Select Free Trial and it 
Does not require a username. With the new version during installation you will need to remove the current code that is present in the trial, just Use the Keygen to generate a desired serial for what ever version you want then copy the serial and simply paste it over the serial during installation of the new Avg 2013.
Using Old avg Editions you may be safe to delete  the username just enter a fake name and enter the serial you generated. Hope this helps:)"
,Cassie2,2012-09-24T02:01Z,"Well, it's already telling me my license has expired again. :( 

I sure hope that some of the other downloaders come back and say how it is working for them. I would especially like to know if they already had a copy of AVG on their computers before installing and using the keygens here - it seems to me that even if I delete the copy I now have and download the Free Trial version and start from there that they are going to know by my computer that I already had a copy, no? 

Grrrr. How dare they do this to innocent people! :-D 

Thanks again, Macstar! You are indeed a Star! :) "
