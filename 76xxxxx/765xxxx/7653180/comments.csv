english subtiles anywhere???"
,Landlordance,2012-09-22T22:50Z,"Yes, of course, I'll upload the next two (Ep 7 & 8) on wednesday. Unfortunately, english subs are not yet available. You'll have to wait until Spiral 4 is shown on British TV, sometime in novembre, I think. 
Your French seems pretty good. You'll have some difficulty maybe with the police slang. But it's so well performed that you don't miss much besides this very colourful language.
