Harry Choates~Five-Time Loser (Harlequin) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Harry ChoatesΓÇÖ musical career differs somewhat from most Cajun artists of the period due to his varied styles, notably that of Western swing and Honky tonk. All of his music was professionnally driven by a smooth fiddle (borrowed and never returned!) that cut through a unique musical home-grown output that is today highly sought after by collectors and listeners alike, who seek to find the music behind one of the originators of modern-day Cajun music.

''27 track compilation covers the full range of this cajun fiddler/guitarist's earliest 1940 sides w. the Rayne Bo Ramblers to his final sessions. A followup to "Jole Blon" and thirteen other performances, it includes the Hank Williams inspired "Cat 'n Around." It has a rough sound but great music, blending Cajun, swing, and honky tonk.''
