POtHS comment. Hillsong Chapel is Back with another Great Album


Description

Hillsong Chapel is an intimate and devotional collection of Hillsong songs by the Hillsong Live team. Recorded live in the Hillsong Chapel in March 2010, ΓÇ£YahwehΓÇ¥ is the first installment in this organic contemplative expression of praise and worship.

Comprised of 13 congregational songs carefully rearranged to be more intimate, this project is perfect for smaller gatherings and will help resource smaller congregations with the favourites from Hillsong Live and Hillsong United.  It is also ideal for your own personal devotional and meditative times of worship.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
