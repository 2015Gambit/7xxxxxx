Description:
Ferris Bueller is an American sitcom based on the 1986 John Hughes's film Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
The half hour situation comedy follows the high school adventures of Ferris Bueller and his
friends. It debuted August 23, 1990 on NBC but was cancelled within its first season, a few
months after its debut. A leftover episode aired in August 1991.

The show stars Charlie Schlatter in the title role (which was played by Matthew Broderick in the
film). Outside of its fan base, the show is known for having starred a then relatively-unknown
Jennifer Aniston in the role of the main character's sister, Jeannie Bueller (played by Jennifer Grey in the film).
