skidrow+fix/3dm not working.
:)"
,Darkerspy,2012-09-20T00:53Z,"I can also confirm this works. Not sure what the difference is though. 
1) replace binary files
2) make shortcut directly to borderlands app
3) Play the damn game."

,coldtrain,2012-09-20T14:31Z,"Downloading, will try and report back, Windows 8 Release preview x64"
,coldtrain,2012-09-20T14:37Z,"Running, got to main menu, will post feedback about audio later today, also this is on RG Games copy"
,debugman18,2012-09-20T16:16Z,"@Gome120 Start the game from the exe, not the launcher.

@coldtrain This should work with nearly any copy; Also sounds are not affected, those depend on the copy. (And this works fine with the R.G. copy, its the one I'm using.)"

,g2thebeast,2012-09-21T07:07Z,Do u just add and replace or delete everything in it? Every time i do it the i have to redo the set up cuz it says i can't access it -___-
,debugman18,2012-09-21T07:28Z,@g2thebeast Just replace everything. And it's telling you what exactly? Something about steamapi.dll?

,asqw9,2012-09-22T10:31Z,"I could not get the game to work in Win7x64, but with this crack it finally worked.

For those with ""d3dx9_43.dll is missing"" errors, you need to install DirectX. Google is your friend."

,Lerianis2,2012-09-25T10:56Z,"Anyone know why the hell some games will not work correctly on Windows 8 lately? I mean, I've never had games not work on Windows 7 and need a specially written crack for them to work."
,darkgamerX,2012-09-25T21:54Z,Lerianis2 for me its only the latest games cracked by skidrow. everything else works under windows 8 when compatibility is set - older games like omikron :(
,XeonWolf,2012-09-26T04:34Z,@asqw9  Are you sure that will fix the DLL missing issue?
,XeonWolf,2012-09-26T05:50Z,"well my question is how do you managed to make this work for win8, what did you do with the launcher and all?"
