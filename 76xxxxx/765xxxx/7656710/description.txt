If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: Android 2.2 and up
Overview: This is a Neon Minimal theme for GO Launcher EX. Also fully compatible with Apex Launcher, Nova Launcher & others.

This theme contains 240+ icons & counting! & it also contains the 6 wallpapers seen in the screenshots.

IN GO LAUNCHER, THESE ICONS LOOK BEST WHEN YOU SET THE ICON SIZE TO LARGE! (menu>preferences>visual settings>icons>icon size) They also look their best against dark backgrounds.
I take icon requests so please feel free to email me or leave a comment suggesting which app icons you'd like to see themed & I'll try to make it =)

This is NOT a standalone app, you need a launcher such as Go, Apex, Nova, etc that allow custom themes.

Installation
1. Install Go Launcher, Apex, or Nova (all free in the Play Store)
2. Install this theme
3. Find Neon Minimal in any of the launcher's theme settings, then apply.

What's in this version:
Updated to 1.9 on [September 4th, 2012]
- Added 8 requested icons.
- Updated & cleaned up some icons, & fixed some that weren't showing up properly (Galaxy S3)
- I also have matching Neon Minimal themes for Go SMS, Go Contacts & Go Locker, check 'em out!
Any theme issues with Jelly Bean? Email me & I'll send you the latest version!
