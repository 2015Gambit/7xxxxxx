Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant and author Gerald Celente about the looting of the economy and the financial disaster waiting in the wings. 

On today's worldwide broadcast, Infowars reporters Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton present part one of an ongoing series exposing Agenda 21 and the organized theft of private lands by the global elite as they get the masses accustomed to diminished expectations and the ultimate culling of the herd. 

David Ortiz reports on the move to oust the globalist Rick Perry as the governor of Texas in favor of the patriot champion Ron Paul. 

Note: the majority of today's show consists of previously recorded, previously aired [on Infowars Nightly News] material. There were no calls.
