Lucid Rounds is an icon replacement pack for Android. It comes with over 415 icons, 290 dark and 125 white. The pack will be updated according to requests the same or a day after. However you need to send me the email you purchased the pack with -- for confirmation. PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!

For the people that purchased this icon pack, the white version is free of charge! It's included in this update. There are 270 Classic Black Lucid Rounds and 125 White Lucid Rounds, feel free to send requests at any time!

If you could give me a rating, that'd be great! I appreciate each rating. If you have problems, let me know, don't just give me a bad rating, it won't solve anything.

PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!

- THIS IS NOT A THEME
- IT WILL STAY AS AN ICON PACK! IT WILL NOT BE MADE INTO A THEME!
- IT WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY REPLACE YOUR ICONS
- YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE ICONS MANUALLY
- YOU NEED TO HAVE AN APP THAT LET'S YOU CHANGE YOUR STOCK ICONS
- I WILL NOT ACCEPT REQUESTS IF YOU DIDN'T BUY IT
- ALL YOU GET IS A ZIP FILE
- THE 'APK' SERVES AS AN EASY WAY TO PAY FOR THE ICONS

To change the icons you can use Desktop Visualizer or any launcher like Go Launcher, Nova Launcher, ADW Launcher, Launcher Pro, etc.


If the market says your device is incompatible, that most probably means because my app doesn't recognize the ROM or Android version you're running. Compatible Android versions are from Froyo to ICS. Jelly Bean is not yet compatible, but will be soon.

If you don't want to wait, you can buy my icon packs over paypal on my site. If you purchase it, you'll get an automatic download of the ZIP File, NOT the APK because it would be quite pointless.

If you think $0.99 is a lot of money for this much icons so you gotta steal it from me, well then you're just really sad. <- Don't get offended by that, if you don't steal it, you shouldn't get offended. Just saying.
