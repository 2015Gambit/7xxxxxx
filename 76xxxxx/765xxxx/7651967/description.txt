From virtual unknowns to stars of the Warped Tour and stadiums across Europe, HorrorPops have thrived on the strength of great songwriting, remarkable intuition, a jaw-dropping live experience and a willingness to explore an array of styles. Be it new wave, punk, surf, ska, rockabilly, metal or goth, the trio's self-produced, film-centric third Hellcat album, Kiss Kiss Kill Kill, embraces all of the aforementioned rock & roll subgenres with admirable aplomb.
