I really meant to include this caveat with this one, because it doesn't have the highest quality. Hopefully 'Yummy Fur' will look better when it's done.

Part of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader some of you may actually need to shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.	"
