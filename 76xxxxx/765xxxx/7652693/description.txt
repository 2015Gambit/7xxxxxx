Predators is a series of six films that use miniaturized
cameras mounted on the hunters themselves to show the
chase between hunter and hunted from their perspective.
It uses action replays and computer animations that
analyze the tactics of both predator and prey from
various angles.

This is a superb piece of natural history film making,
even by the BBC natural history unit's high standards.
The series focuses on the great predators of the animal
world and how they catch their prey- but it's not all
blood and guts, the focus is on how predators have
evolved sophisticated adaptations to "outwit" their prey.
Innovative film-making techniques make the series
visually stunning as well as informative.
At one point viewers are taken aboard a golden eagle as
it hunts for mountain hares: the eagle's reaction times
are beyond belief! A must for anyone with an interest
in natural history.
