Since 1990, when Robert JordanΓÇÖs The Wheel of Time┬« burst on the world with its first book, The Eye of the World, readers have been anticipating the finale of this extraordinary saga, which has sold over forty million copies in over thirty languages.

The wait will soon be over. The fourteenth and final volume, A Memory of Light, will be available in hardcover and audiobook on January 8, 2013.

However, you can read the prologue, ΓÇ£By Grace and Banners Fallen,ΓÇ¥ before the bookΓÇÖs official release date. The prologue will be available in both electronic text and digital audio formats in October 2012.

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass.
What was, what will be, and what is,
May yet fall under the Shadow.

Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.
