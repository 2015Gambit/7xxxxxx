"No doubt best of the (3) Stephens in '83. Its still hard to compare to the first, since MSG was lifting up into the air like a giant 
spinning ship, and people were literally writhing on the floor in utter glee... (everybody's playing in the heart of gold band 
beyond description) But in Hartford, they seemed more prepared for the musical intricacies and audience reciprocation. Beautiful, 
lilting acidic show, (sweet China Doll) with heights only St. Stephen can deliver."
