,KNorbert,2012-09-21T11:07Z,"The challenge works, the other does not"
,thebigretard,2012-09-21T19:23Z,"wii 4.3 U, softmodded USB loader GX. Launches fine but then when selecting a game to play it crashes and restarts my Wii. Doesn't work for me. Time to delete this game."
,qskenzer,2012-09-21T20:56Z,"Really nice upload, thanks much!! Works great with USB Loader GX and Configurable."
,super1313,2012-09-22T02:23Z,anybody try different settings to load the game?
,playboi28,2012-09-22T21:14Z,"To help everyone out:

When trying to play a game with multiple games on the Wii using a USB loader (Metroid Prime Collection, Sam & Max, etc) you have to run each game's separate DOL.  Under options, you'll see something in the menu that says Alt Dol.  There you can choose which game you want to play."
,playboi28,2012-09-23T01:50Z,"Also, you might need to update your IOS."
,wyattspoppa,2012-09-23T04:07Z,"I confirm, if you try to play the games they all crash except ""challenges"". ""Playboi's"" fix is workable, but a big hassle and not good for kids, puts them in a confusing menu without words or pics, just codes. At the load game menu, go to options (where you can make changes Ocarina etc and select the alt-dol & change that to the other option (there are only 2 choices, the default and the one you want). Then it will show you 6 alphanumeric codes, each is a game, one says 64 etc so you know it's ""Crystal Shards"". We either need a fix from you menu experts or a new copy, thanks for the upload though. I did this from memory, ask me and I'll tell you the exact path to play..."
,cdowning,2012-09-23T04:13Z,"Tried changing the dol settings, and after selecting the game it goes to a black screen and won't let you do anything.......so idk what else to do to make this work"

,wwiggles,2012-09-23T19:35Z,"Works perfectly fine. I think a lot of people have outdated IOS versions. 

Try using Pimp My Wii and see. I updated about 6 months ago and all the games that used to fail now work like MW3 or the latest Zelda.

I tried both Configurable and usb loader gx (ver 3.0c) and played all games and they start just fine."
,wwiggles,2012-09-23T19:41Z,For best compatibility you should be using d2x  cIOS rev 8
,boutsjp,2012-09-24T09:30Z,"Thanks for all HobbitGamez... I follow you, I have only your games all...  can you upload some wii games from dragon ball if you can ?? Im from mexico city regards my friend"
,juvey10031,2012-09-24T17:24Z,"=This games loads ok, but doesnt work when playing the collection. Challenges work fine. I think hobbit u should remove this one."
,Narugami,2012-09-25T03:40Z,You could upload Mortal Kombat Armageddon Wii version ?
,thebigretard,2012-09-26T04:34Z,"I take my previous comment back. After reading 'PlayBoi28' 's comment - ""When trying to play a game with multiple games on the Wii using a USB loader (Metroid Prime Collection, Sam & Max, etc) you have to run each game's separate DOL. Under options, you'll see something in the menu that says Alt Dol. There you can choose which game you want to play. "" 

I followed that and now it works. So big thank you 'playboi28' although it is a little of a hassle, it worked."
,juvey10031,2012-09-27T03:06Z,Hey Hobbit do u think u can get Harley Pasternak's Hollywood Workout
,GopherTee,2012-09-27T21:50Z,DOES NOT WORK!
,wwiggles,2012-09-28T21:35Z,"It works perfectly fine. You don't even have to do the individual .dol thing. Game works like any other.  

UPDATE YOUR IOS VERSIONS! Newer games will not work with your 2010 hacked wii. Like this one."
[H],shirepirate,2012-09-29T02:26Z,wwigles is right. I have tested it and this game works swell without using alternate DOL method.
,ClipperCigars,2012-09-29T09:50Z,"Works just fine as is, no alt dol BS needed.

Using cios d2x-v8 and configurable usb loader v70r48.

Cios's and loaders are still actively being updated people! Keep yer shit up to date and you won't have problems. "
,sentafria,2012-10-03T15:17Z,"I can't access the collection, i'm using the last version of Dolphin Emulator. The game crashes."
