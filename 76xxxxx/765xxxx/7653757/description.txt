Spiritual Warfare:
Pastor Charles Lawson preaching on the good fight of faith. You are either giving it all or giving in. Where do you stand?

Spiritual Nature:
Charles Lawson 07/18/12 (WN) Matthew 12:43-45 Text About Unclean Spirit Returning With Seven Spirits Worse Than Himself Launches Examination of Our Own Spiritual Nature and the Inherent Animosity Between Flesh and Spirit.

God Became Flesh:
Pastor Charles Lawson contrast Old Testament and New Testament concepts of the nature of man, emerging with greater revelation about the Godhead and Jesus Christ The Almighty. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.(I Timothy 3:16)

Jesus Christ Is the Stone:
Charles Lawson 08/05/12 (SN) Daniel 2:31-35 Examination of Four of the Seven Times In Scripture In Which "Stone" Referes To the Lord Jesus Christ.  An excellent sermon that addresses so very much, to include the Dispensations and salvation from the wrath of God, which the Church will NOT suffer!
