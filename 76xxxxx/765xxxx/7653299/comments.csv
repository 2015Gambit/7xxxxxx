And the ""Pirate of the Year"" award goes to ... ٩(͡●▂◣)۶ ... Aarrghh, and hurrah yea!

Thanks dellefs0. 

Wow! Compressed from 19 GB to 2.92 GB, 1080p resolution. It still took 3 days to download. I hate to think how long 19 GB would have taken.

I will seed until the cows come home."

dellefs0, do you or anyone else know where to download HiRes versions of Christopher Guest movies: ""WAITING FOR GUFFMAN-1996"", ""BEST IN SHOW-2000"", and ""A MIGHTY WIND-2003""?
If they exist in HiRes, 八（´・｀ ）I'm beggin' ya, post the url.
I was only able to find ""THIS IS SPINAL TAP-1984"" in HiRes."
