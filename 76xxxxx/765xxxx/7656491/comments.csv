V7.5 A8

But the rar file almost made me NOT download it. Seriously, drop this nonsense. We're not in the 90s anymore. (Whoever made the file wich is not necessarily the uploader).

Cheers !"
,ime021,2012-09-21T15:31Z,"it a very good video quality...not BrRip, but far better than cams, and ts, and all sort of early releases.
Audio is in the same category.
Highly watchable and very good movie. 
This will pretty-much satisfy everyone's appetite, except those techno-freaks who like to watch their movies in ""god almighty resolution""...:) 
Thanks to uploader...could do it without RAR's but thanks anyway..cheers "
