"Walk the Dinosaur" is a hit single recorded and released by the band Was (Not Was) in 1987, later featured on their hit 1988 album, What Up, Dog? The song features a tight, funky sound, punctuated by horns and cowbell, along with what sounds like cavepeople chanting in the background, while the lyrics relate to life in prehistoric times.

When released in the UK in 1987, the song reached No. 10 on the charts, becoming the group's first Top 10 hit there. After the music video to the song (which featured four scantily clad cavewomen dancing to the song, a Flintstones-style TV playing clips from Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur, and then modern people dancing to the song in the "Everybody kill the dinosaur" part) received heavy rotation on MTV, the song reached No. 7 on the U.S. charts in 1989, two years after its UK success. The song is the biggest hit single for the band in their home country.
