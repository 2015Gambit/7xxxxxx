,.nev.,2012-09-19T16:43Z,"SHIT GAME. No graphic options, no controller settings, shitty music WTF"
,GObonzo,2012-09-19T16:54Z,"to change resolution open:
%:Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HDEngineConfigBaseEngine.ini
and edit lines to desired res:
ResX=1920
ResY=1080"
,DamnKeto,2012-09-19T19:47Z,"Let's be clearer:

To change gamma (brightness) go to: THSPSHDEngineConfigBaseEngine.ini, and search: ""DisplayGamma"", must be at least in 2.0.
Gamma range is between 1.6-2.2.

To change game resolution go to: THSPSHDEngineConfigBaseEngine.ini, and search: ""resX"" and ""resY"", edit them to whatever you want.
i.e.: resX=1920; resY=1080."
,makaronie,2012-09-19T20:35Z,How to change gamepad config or even how to get gamepad working. I dont have xbo360 game pad but juz reguler pad which looks limiliar to ps3 dual shock. this game just dissapointed me
,GObonzo,2012-09-19T21:30Z,"DamnKeto, and how is that clearer? if they dont know how to use .ini files they aint gonna learn from these posts.
trying to set Windowed Mode for eyefinity but not so far. if you've had any luck post this also."
,STONEDSTONER,2012-09-20T02:34Z,"@makaronie

get X360ce  (xbox 360 controller emulator)

Put X360ce.exe in ActivisionTony Hawks Pro Skater HDBinariesWin32

Setup your controller with it and launch game"
,Cr4ck_69,2012-09-20T06:16Z,Works But i Cant Save
,standstill2142,2012-09-20T07:41Z,thanks 
,makaronie,2012-09-20T13:08Z,"@ATONEDSTONER 
I download a program but when i try to configure it i have problem, the program constantly count somthing and number of counts is equal to number of errors. Theres a list of gamepad to choose but there is no my one. I had cheap made in china game pad that cost about 10 $."
,Estigma,2012-09-20T22:17Z,"this game needs some mods to correct the bullsh*t port with silly baill efects and lack of graphic options the programers have done.
good game and good upload tho."
,ngage3650,2012-09-21T16:05Z,"Heads up for anyone who can not save the game.

If you are running Vista/7 this should work for you.

Once you have installed the game (And ticked the create a shortcut on desktop box), every time you launch the game, right click the shortcut and go to ""Run as Administrator"".

If you don't do that, it will come up during the initial loading of the game that the save file has limited access and the game will not be saved or something like that.

Although to be fairly honest this port is terrible. No options for adjusting settings (unless you edit .ini files etc), poor bails and animation, no fluid combos like the originals had. It's just a very poor release from Activision :(

Stick to Skate or the better Tony Hawk Games!

Torrent was 10/10 apart from the save thing.

Thanks!"
,ttouche,2012-09-21T20:22Z,save dosnt work is there a fix yet
,welhim,2012-09-22T15:05Z,im using windows 7 64bit and this game is 100% works fine.. the save works and it depends on the character you used.
,dpsp89,2012-09-23T06:47Z,"for whoever thats having difficulties in controller setting, just download program called XPADDER. it will emulate your controller as a keyboard press, so it will work with any computer game, but the drawback you just need to  configure it for every game, 

Also please remember to take snapshot of keyboard layout, it will be used to set your config in xpadder.

XPADDER not free anymore, so grab the cracked or pirated one. Cheers. 

GAME IS SUCK BTW, old tony hawk still give us more freedom than this game."
,damp_,2012-09-23T12:03Z,"Worst Tony hawks game ever, its ugly and feels so dam crap"
,STONEDSTONER,2012-09-24T02:31Z,"@makaronie dont worry about that just setup your pad with it,its easy... 

x360ce is Much better then xpadder you have analog,you only need to set it up once then drag and drop into any windows game that supports 360 pad and your controller will work"
,hell911,2012-09-24T04:16Z,thanks!!!!!!!
,hell911,2012-09-24T04:19Z,thanks for this!
,rasouzza,2012-09-30T04:21Z,"Tks!!!!
Works but i need search .dll on Google.

... and install Update.1-SKIDROW if your save erased"
