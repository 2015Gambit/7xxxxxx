,Naraku77,2012-09-26T09:08Z,"Wow, what's with all the requests for keys?  If you would run this in anything other than a VM at this point in time, I've got this bridge I'll sell you for cheap ;)

Thanks again for putting these up for the techs who will be needing them.  Since M$ seems to be throwing us under a bus here with this Metro shit, I think I'll see if I can't convince LogMeIn to add an ""Emerge Desktop Installer"" -- I can only imagine all the people that are going to be confused as Hell by the new interface and want something that resembles the traditional menu."
