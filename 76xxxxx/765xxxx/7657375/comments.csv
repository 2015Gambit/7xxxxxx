,gleekdork,2012-09-23T11:41Z,I have been downloading you glee torrents recently and they're all good but I really want you an AVI format. I don't play the videos on my computer. Instead I'm playing them in my DVD player[with usb port] and it only plays AVI format vids. My family really loves glee and they don't want to watch it on the computer. Please upload avi format of glee. Thank you so much. We love you. :)
