,lAsphyxial,2012-09-20T14:37Z,this is actually a 1080 mp4 but quality is very nice none the less.
,Pizzabox23,2012-09-20T15:59Z,"Oh whoops, I accidentally attached a higher quality version in the torrent rather than the 720p version.
I guess you could consider it a bonus!"
,MoMoCHu5,2012-09-20T23:29Z,Can you post the 720p ver too please
,NattilyFizzle,2012-09-28T16:33Z,I found the sound and the video were out of sync. Don't know if it's just me or not that this has happened to.
