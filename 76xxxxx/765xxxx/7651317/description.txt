PALM PRE (POSSIBLY PALM PIXI) CRACK METHOD!

K if you're like me you've heard about the kill switch in the new iphones and how all the others are trackable. Palm Pre was the last smartphone i actually liked and trusted. Every time i get one its been locked by the phone provider. I'm going to show you in a few steps how to break the lock, and crack the phone for wifi usage and web navigation.

==========================================
1. Download Java, Google it (You'll need it cuz most of this is jar files)

2. Install The Unlocker program (INCLUDED with drivers) (ignore serials and registration codes, run in demo mode after installing)



3. Pull the battery from your phone and reinstall the battery, pressing and holding Volume up, plug in your usb while still holding, this starts recovery mode



4. Click Unlock phone, the touch pad will show you a logo. Now as long as that logo shows even if the program errors, its cracked.



5. Pull the usb and let the phone reboot, voila, back to the desktop of the phone, unlocked and account bypassed.


6. If you wish to add custom homebrewn apps and system tweaks and new kernals, download WebOS and update thru that program ( INCLUDED)

This is my method, walkthru and files, you now know its legit and clean.
Also if you wish to add Homebrewn thru the WebOS without the aid of a computer. Once its cracked, install the Preware Catalog IPK installer here, it is importable thru WebOS Quick Install, download it here ALSO INCLUDED


Now for the ipk packages i included with it, i have no idea if they are all compatible with the palm pre, the ones ive been testing are kinda hit and miss running
Unfortunately all i kept running into was dead MU links, and i almost cried. So here's what the leftovers were that i could find. Hope they work for someone.
I did have some luck with some of them. A few paid for apps worked, some haven't.
