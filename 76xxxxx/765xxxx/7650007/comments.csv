,ryjus,2012-09-18T19:47Z,SKIDROW? 
,tflagger997,2012-09-18T19:55Z,"No thanks.  This is a DUP of something that is already here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7649558/Borderlands_2_%282012%29_SKIDROW_

While we appreciate the effort, we have to cut down on constant spam that clutters TPB.  

scenebalance is not getting the same warning since their upload was within 30 minutes of DIRT_ZONE's, so they would not have been able to see it if they had done a search.

If you come across any DUPs please link back to the original and help eliminate this practice.  Thanks!"
,gaveasky,2012-09-18T20:03Z,missing a .dll file when i try to run it.. anyone else got the same issue? 
,blunts420,2012-09-18T20:31Z,no shit its the same torrent but skidrows is downloading at 20kbps were as this is downloading at 1 gigabyte per second ur the only one creating clutter tflagger997
,fuhckers,2012-09-19T00:27Z,How about some of you assholes help out and start seeding...... My upload is going twice as fast as the DL is going........   SEEEEEED PEOPLE.
,tflagger997,2012-09-19T01:13Z,"Really, 1GB/s.  Could you please share whatever you are on?"
,fuhckers,2012-09-19T05:26Z,A little help with the uploading would be nice.....  You dicks keep hopping on here to leech w/o seeding... Help contribute a little and SEEEEEEED!!
,fuhckers,2012-09-19T05:34Z,You guys do realize that if more of you are seeding the download will go faster......   It will actually benefit yourself and others.  Win win.  now Seed please.
,tflagger997,2012-09-19T17:19Z,"Well apparently TPB staff took down DIRT_ZONE's stuff for some reason.  I was coming back to warn that some of these were creating a rundll.exe in data/skype and it was probably a keylogger (though Avast could not detect it).  After installing B2 open your process window and see if anything is running 99% of your CPU (except Idle Process of course).  If so, you have a problem.

If it is just the rundll in the Skype folder, just stop the program in the process window, delete the file, and then empty the recycle bin.  Restart the computer to confirm, and after all your startup programs load check the the process window again."
,_Eleison_,2012-09-20T01:27Z,"doesn't seem to want to work, Followed the instructions, copied the cracking files  pasted and the splash page crashes after I click start:"
,HatefulxxDesign,2012-09-20T07:07Z,"When I mount the .iso into Daemon Tools, It says ""windows cant access this disk. The disk might be corrupt."" I have tried Force Re-Checking and redownloading it quite a few times to no avail. Any ideas?"
,fuhckers,2012-09-20T07:41Z,"Downloaded this yesterday. It took 8 hours, but it works perfectly. If you are having problems it is probably your fault. This is a damn good game and I plan on buying it soon so I can jam with friends.
  Thanks TFK"
,fuhckers,2012-09-20T07:45Z,"Oh yeah, and I checked my processes and nothing abnormal is running and nothing is running 99% of my PCU.  Clean upload as far as I can tell."
,Razorsedge911,2012-09-21T19:48Z,"If anyone has the problem with this game not loading after clicking play. Use this crack.
