,corsair47,2012-09-20T01:50Z,"Am about 50% of the way done, I'll seed plenty after I'm done. I trust this is a good rip, Kaos always does good work."
,natelildogg,2012-09-20T07:11Z,"I love the torrent, KaOs usually never fails me, but it seems I have encountered a few bugs in the game. For instance, whenever I went down I had only a black screen, and i couldn't see anything I was shooting at until I died. And another time, I saved and exited, I would come back at a completely different spot. Any idea how to fix this?"
,erwin0629,2012-09-20T12:26Z,SEEEED please
,levin123,2012-09-20T13:03Z,"gansuk..you are the master of compression.

,ahadafzal13,2012-09-20T19:49Z,Can any one explain what is Movie/Recode:-------------[ 45% Bik ]-
,PseudoPositive,2012-09-20T20:04Z,"@ahad, it simply means it's 45% of the original video quality, giving us far less of a file size to download; I've seen some bad re-encoding in other torrents, but they did a good job with this rip."
,Thisnameistaken,2012-09-21T01:54Z,"Just signed up to comment. I got this torrent. Works great. The videos still look fine.

I just have one question. For the windows firewall can I allow it or not? The reason I ask is because I read in the comments for another torrent for Borderlands 2 that you can play with other people with a program called Tunngle."
[V],gansuk,2012-09-21T03:00Z,"if u want to play it online then yes u have to allow it in firewall
and yes it works thru tunngle as iv bin playing it online me self"
,Thisnameistaken,2012-09-21T04:32Z,"With windows firewall though do I have to allow public networks, or private? Or both? Or what?
And will allowing it, ya know, be bad for any reason possibly?

I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed. Goodnight."
,kcfunnthesun,2012-09-21T12:41Z,"getting ""corruption error"" this thing took so long to download.=("
,FarkNasty,2012-09-21T22:10Z,"registered just to comment on this torrent,  it worked perfect and was absolutely simple to install.  Just be patient, let it do its thing, and presto.  Game has been playing flawlessly and the graphics still look awesome.  I don't know anything about the online capabilities, I haven't bothered with it.  Kaos is great, I also got Skyrim and New Vegas, and they both work fantastically.  Thanks, and keep up the good work!"
,fluster84,2012-09-22T20:14Z,I can confirm that this torrent works perfectly! Installed the game and have been playing without any problems for a couple of hours now. Thank you Kaoskrew and gansuk. Keep up the great work guys.

I will seed thanks for Ur efforts."
,Oingele,2012-09-30T00:01Z,"Hmm, all your previous torrents worked just fine for me, but with this one my computer gets a BlueScreen and restarts :/ I don't know why, but after I press ""Play"" my Computer freezes and restarts."
,herpthederp,2012-09-30T06:30Z,"Works great, awesome dl speed too."
,timothyormoss,2012-09-30T16:37Z,"
