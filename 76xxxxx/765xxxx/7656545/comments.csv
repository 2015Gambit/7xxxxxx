,lasskke,2012-09-20T22:06Z,"Commentary sucks anyway.
Thx for this."
[V],globeplus,2012-09-21T01:00Z,"To bloodred : if you search on the net maybe you find the commentary files to the languages individually available , on the last few years for this game soon or later that happened on one or another site on the net ... so who knows maybe can happen to this year game too ... i have to say that not even for me that i want the commentarys , why ? because can be fun for a game or 2 but after that in my point of view they start to be repetitive and a kind of annoying and the option to disable them inside the game it is available too but i respect the wish to want them but in my honest opinion they are dispensable , not really needed to be enjoying to play the game ...

Happy game to all of you . "

this probably isn't the right forum but how the heck do I get the razarrhivrovannuyu folder in your torrents?!!
I have followed the instructions but even after extracting it with free arc I can't see it, unless there's something I'm missing out on because at the end of it all I can't play.    "
