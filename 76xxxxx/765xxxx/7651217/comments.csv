,muddemon4,2012-09-22T02:45Z,when i try to start the game it opens my steam account in the store section so that I may purchase the game. How do I play the damn thing. Please that is all I want.
,Ferch1,2012-09-23T03:09Z,"@gforcemayhem and kcfunnthesun, what did you use to mount it? I'm using DAEMON tools lite and doesn't work."
,meatboy987,2012-09-23T21:28Z,"@muddemon4: Read the instructions.  ""Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder to install directory and overwrite.""  Once you do that, you won't be bothered with Steam activation ever again.  Also, FYI, you don't even need to have Steam on after that, that is the whole point of acquiring these games on here.

@Ferch1: Try VirtualCloneDrive.  Hasn't let me down so far ;) ."
