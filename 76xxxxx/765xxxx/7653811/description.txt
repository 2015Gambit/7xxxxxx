 Around Sound Pro allows you to listen to music and still be aware of your surroundings.
What it does:
*PRO Version ONLY* Street Mode:ΓÇ¿
+Walk down the street and only hear the noises above the set trigger level. Never interrupts your music.
Pause Music Mode:ΓÇ¿

+Uses your headset's microphone to listen for loud noises and pause your music if one is detected, then play back the sound that triggered the pause and continues for a short period of time the optionally resumes your music.


Pro Amp:

    Pause and Resume work but have to set option:
    Settings-> Audio Engine -> Audio Focus Change -> Check "Short Audio Focus Change"
    Pause works but stops the music and the notification bar service.
    Uber Music:
    Pause and Resume works. Pause works but stops the music and the notification bar service.
    MixZing:
    Unfortunately the current version of MixZing doesn't seem to handle calls from other applications requesting audio control like a music app should.

Note:
This is my first app so please send me feedback good or bad. If something is wrong let me know first before giving a low rating. ΓÇ¿Also don't use any task killer apps, they will probably kill this program. And they're not really worth using anyways.
