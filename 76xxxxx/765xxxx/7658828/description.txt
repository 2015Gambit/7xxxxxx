The talent pits her against the ambitious wife (Garner) of the reigning champion (Burrell) in the annual butter sculpture competition. Butter follows an ambitious woman (Jennifer Garner) who is married to Iowa’s reigning butter sculpting champ (Ty Burrell) but decides to enter the race on her own when he retires. She’s the shoo-in until an adopted young black girl (Yara Shahidi) discovers she has an uncanny talent for butter-carving and becomes a late-breaking favorite.
