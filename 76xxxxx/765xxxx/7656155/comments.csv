Not a single download completed after 18 hours. Another honeypot torrent that harvests IPs to send 3-strike notices to? [yawn]"

[T],dynstab2,2012-09-21T19:43Z,"At 5:30pm Friday (GMT), tracker scrapes (all 3 udp) show no single complete download. You mean all seeding through DHT and PEX? Possible but very, very, very unlikely (all 3 udp trackers are working fine). Also TPB's own scrapes announce a variable 2~5 seeds since yesterday, all temporarily assigned, and a horde of DL peers for a small 3-MB file. All the other torrent sites that harvested your .torrent file (the small green/blue file you created with your torrent client and posted to TPB) show the same scrape stats.

My question: Are you seeding the file? Torrenting (peer-to-peer; TPB) is not like direct downloading (site-to-peer; rapidshare, hotfile, filepost,...). The original file (Solution Manual Files.zip) is on your HD and you are the one who will seed it to the first few DL peers who will, in turn, seed to help you with other DL peers.

NOTA: This solution manual is not an ISM (Instructor's Solution Manual) but an SSM (Student Solution Manual). It gives solutions to exercises (E*.*), answers (not solutions) to a few selected problems (P*.*) and answers to all practice tests (T*.*)."
