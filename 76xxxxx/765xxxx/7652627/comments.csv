,anacondon,2012-09-21T20:02Z,"I second abraxas8r's comment!  Rendered speechless when I stumbled upon this/these treasure(s) as have been collecting the physical magazine from its inception in April 1970 to (what i considered its 'demise' qualitatively, editorially, etc [when matty simmons stopped publishing], no offense to anyone, just my opinion) in 1990, paying upwards of $50/issue for some pristine copies.  Absolute genius parody(ies), especially the late great Doug Kenney, Henry Beard, Chris Miller; great animators, etc.  All lovers of The Onion need to seek out their unsung ancestor(s) Nat Lamp.  Phenomenal upload, gravitysewers.  Thank you to infinity!  Will seed as long as I can!"
,vtdaug,2012-09-22T11:17Z,"I've heard it said that there was a decline in quality after 1975 when Gerald Taylor quit as publisher. I'm curious to see if that's really true. It seems like editors Beard, Hendra, Kenney, Kelly, O'Rourke and O'Donoghue would have had more control over content before and after '75.

Will we see more uploads?"
