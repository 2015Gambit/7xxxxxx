The story you are about to read is derived from a carefully researched paper presented by Dr. Peter Lindemann before a private audience in Irvine, California on September 12, 2000. The lecture was titled ΓÇ£The Free Energy Secrets of Cold ElectricityΓÇ¥ . It detailed the story of Radiant Energy and its successful application by Edwin Gray in an over unity motor design which Gray debuted in 1973. The real detective work ( & credit) in uncovering TeslaΓÇÖs discovery of Radiant energy came from author Gerry Vassilatos in his recent book, ΓÇ£Secrets of Cold War TechnologyΓÇ¥ without which Lindemann could not have solved the enigma of GrayΓÇÖs Radiant circuit design. This lecture delivered the goods. The secret of TeslaΓÇÖs Radiant Energy has finally been revealed in manifold detail and only awaits the industry of those who care to study and understand it. Part1 presents a general overview of TeslaΓÇÖs discovery and the political, intrigues that led to its subsequent suppression. Part 2 will detail the nuts and bolts of how Tesla produced Radiant Energy with block diagrams, schematics, and drawings from TeslaΓÇÖs original patents to illustrate all of the necessary elements and parameters required. Additional details on GrayΓÇÖs modern adaptation of TeslaΓÇÖs Radiant circuitry and a brief look at Eric Dollard, the only man to successfully recreate TeslaΓÇÖs Colorado Springs Magnifying transmitter and reproduce the pure steaming white rays of Radiant energy in 1986 exactly as described by Tesla in his Colorado journals.
