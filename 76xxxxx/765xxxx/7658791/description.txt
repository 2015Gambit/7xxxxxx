Sarah Rivera has a lot going on in her life right now. ItΓÇÖs bad enough that sheΓÇÖs being shipped off to Temt Tchaas AcademyΓÇöalso known as Neteru Academy, a high school for future Guardians of the Light who have special powersΓÇöbut she has to go there with her cocky twin brother and the rest of her compound brothers and sisters. To make matters worse, everyone has ridiculous expectations of her all because her parents are like supernatural rock stars for saving the planet sixteen years ago. But what nobody, not even her best girlfriend Tami seems to be getting is the fact that, sheΓÇÖs not special, doesnΓÇÖt want to be a demon-hunting hero, and is even afraid of the dark!

So what that her mother was a warrior angel and her Dad used to be a Council level Vampire? Opposites attract. Go figure. As far as Sarah is concerned, all she got from the combination was a pair of fangs that lengthen at inappropriate times to embarrass her in front of her secret crush; whereas her brother, Alejandro, got the good looks and cool wings. However, what her parentsΓÇÖ status has created is drama in her life, by ensuring that the mean girls at school will make her life a living nightmare. Sarah knows her familyΓÇÖs renowned slayer reputation will also ensure that everyone at school will assume she had it easy and should be able to do everything her famous rebel parents can do, when she canΓÇÖt. Not by a long shot.

Once at the hidden boarding school, things go from bad to worse as Sarah tries to fit in. Her nightmares increase and it isnΓÇÖt just anxietyΓÇöher second sight is suddenly developing at a record pace. Layers of secrets are held by the building, held by her parents, and nothing is as it seems. There is something really bad going on at the school, worse than badΓÇödeadly. Only, faculty and administrators donΓÇÖt know where to begin to look for the cause as students start to disappear. Sarah must then make a choice to stand on the sidelines or to help use her gifts to save someone dear. But to do that means facing all of her greatest fears, along with a demon or two.
