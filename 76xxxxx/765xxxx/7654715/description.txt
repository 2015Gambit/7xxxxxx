Cheesey Turd mixtape

Mixed By Bastard Clone



This is a video mixtape, in HD.  The vids are from the tracks, some are edited and there are nice transitions/edits with the mixes.
The vids have lots of sexy ladies, so is a good fun tape.
Good for getting ready to go out, if you like pop house.
