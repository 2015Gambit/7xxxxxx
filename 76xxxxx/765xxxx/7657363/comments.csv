,lolindir356,2012-09-21T11:47Z,whats the diff with reloaded version? does it support local lan too ?
,ski_zx,2012-09-21T12:36Z,"Yes, you can play on LAN."
,talic17,2012-09-22T15:13Z,"work 100% fine.
if you are having random fps drop.
deactivate your antivirus."
,Marikhen,2012-09-22T22:13Z,"The difference between this version and the Reloaded version/crack is that this one doesn't cause issues with at least some AMD GPUs.  My HD6870 kept bouncing between 300 MHz (2D) and 775 MHz (low-power/load 3D) and rarely ever hit 900 MHz.  Needless to say this was not good for my frame rate which often hit 30 FPS despite having said HD6870 alongside a Phenom II x6 1090t and 8gb of RAM, both more than enough for the game.

This cracked version causes absolutely zero drops in my GPU's clock speed which goes at a constant 900 MHz while playing the game."
,Chiitah,2012-09-23T00:09Z,I don't see a Torchlight 2 Theta Crack Only Torrent so I guess we're going to download the entire thing again to try this crack (good thing it's a small sized game :D).
,Crusader2010,2012-09-23T13:45Z,Did anyone have any issues with the saved games? after installing this i cannot see my saved game from version 1.0  even though it exists on the disc.

,kriggs,2012-09-24T21:25Z,"Kaspersky found Trojan.Win32.Chifrax.a in /Torchlight.2.v1.9.5.1.cracked-THETA/Torchlight 2.exe, anybody else? Common AV mistake?"
,ski_zx,2012-09-25T00:56Z,"Yes, it is AV mistake. Installer is clean."
,zashloop,2012-09-25T04:15Z,is it possible to move ur save characters in the demo onto this game ? mind u the demo is 1.1.5 while this is 1.9.5.1 also does an ps3  controllor work with the game ?
,Ferch1,2012-09-25T05:46Z,"Works.

,Enemy_Hero,2012-09-25T16:44Z,"@Marikhen. 
You're boasting about having a Phenom X6>8gb RAM, but you cant afford to give these guys $20 for a legit working copy of this game? Man you need to get your priorities straight. Don't complain that it slows down your shit when you didn't even pay for it. I hope it cooks your f*ckin CPU, then you will have something to whinge about. I've pirated some big games in my time, but stealing $20 off the original developers of Diablo just seems wrong, in the worst way possible. The only thing I do illegitimate on this game is play it over EvolveHQ, but only cos the Runic matchmaking system is broken atm. So glad I have a different patch version to you douchebags, now I wont have to see any of you in the dungeons I patrol. Support good software creators and spring the $20 to buy this legit, it won't break your bank, and after all these guys deserve it considering the amount of work they put it to code it, only to have scum like this rip it off 1 week after release day then complain it doesn't work."
,golddig,2012-09-26T03:53Z,Hey guys is it a full version? i mean it have complete single player missions rite? coz Beta was only till lv21 upgrade
,XilE-,2012-09-27T16:44Z,If you people are looking for a way to play multiplayer with thousands just install Tunngle there are a few thousand on there playing TL2 all the time.
,Marikhen,2012-09-27T20:20Z,"@Enemy_Hero

You're confusing stating relevant facts with bragging, reading a statement about issues with one crack as a statement that the game itself doesn't work, and whining about piracy on a site dedicated to it in a message section for a game crack you don't even use.

Either you're stupid or you're trolling.  Feel free to keep your ranting up though.  I'll contiue checking this topic just to keep an eye out for it even after I buy the game next week."
