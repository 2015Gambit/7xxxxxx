,Hatiloou,2012-09-22T01:32Z,"You call this highspeed?!
I call this leeching without seeding. A czech btrad thinks he can leech @ 7,8mb/s and seed @ 1kb/s.

Even with your recommended settings I'm leeching with 1kb/s. Without, I would reach this 200-2000 times more.

It may could be that you lost a fanatic. :P

,Sgt.Dude,2012-09-23T16:57Z,"I've ran into some problems with the game , but with everyone else saying it works I assume its on my end.
1) When I try to config the game it says that it cant save the config file
2) Upon exiting the game my saves are deleted and I have to start again from the first level
If anyone could help I would be very grateful."
,Sgt.Dude,2012-09-23T20:57Z,"Ok I have fixed one of the problems by launching the laucher as administrator so now I can configure the game, but when I exit it still wont save my progress. Any ideas how to fix this?"
