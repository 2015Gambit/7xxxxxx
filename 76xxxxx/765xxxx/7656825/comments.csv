,RomanCl,2012-09-22T04:36Z,I don't understand the reason for this on TPB. It's a free software. Meaning you can download it for free within like 2 seconds straight from Google. Why would anybody torrent this?

Because not everyone knows that a new google chrome dev version has come out.So i uploaded here to help them.Its free if you dont like the torrent you dont download it.Its simple."
,gonz621,2012-09-25T05:28Z,@bobiras tnx for uploading apps like this. it is useful for back up purposes like when reformating a pc and no internet connection available then we can re install offline and connect to internet later. I've been downloading some of your uploads. tnx
