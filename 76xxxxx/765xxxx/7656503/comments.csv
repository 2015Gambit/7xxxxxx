,Ryan1755,2012-09-22T11:13Z,"Need English subtitles please, very hard of hearing and I enjoy knowing every last word that's being said >_<  

A true DVD rip should come with these anyways, I hate when I see it without them.

He's right, subtitle tracks take almost no space & you can always turn them on or off if you don't like them. They're right there on the DVD, once you upload without them it gets a lot more complicated to get them back.

When doing a DVDrip it's good policy to always either embed or include any subtitle files for speakers of other languages or those (like me) who are hard of hearing after a decade or two working backstage.

No luck yet, I'll keep looking so us poor, deaf bastards can understand what's being said without deafening the neighbors."

,kurohyoneko,2012-09-24T23:54Z,"@Ryan1755, you can download subtitle tracks and import them into the movie if you use VLC or DivX players.  Just google 'Careless Love subtitle tracks.'"
