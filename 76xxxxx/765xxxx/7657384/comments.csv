,gleekdork,2012-09-23T11:32Z,I have been downloading you glee torrent since season 2 but I really want you to upload them in AVI format. I don't play the videos on my computer. Instead I'm playing them in my DVD player and it only plays AVI format vids. My family really loves glee and they don't want to watch it on the computer. Please upload avi format of glee. Thank you so much. We love you. :)
,tinkers84,2012-09-23T12:26Z,@Gleedork try googling Pazera. It's free and you can convert all Mp4 to Avi :)
,gleekdork,2012-09-23T13:29Z,@tinkers84: Thanks for the advice but converting mp4 to avi might lose the vid quality. I'll try pazera. hope it won't yield a bad quality. :)
