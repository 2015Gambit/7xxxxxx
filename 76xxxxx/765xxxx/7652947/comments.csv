,boyznacne,2012-09-20T03:01Z,"Q: Why must I pay to download some of the cheats on your site where other sites are free?
A: Unlike most cheats sites which simply collect cheats and files (typically from sites like ours) we actually have programmers on staff and create custom cheats for most PC games that are released. We also spend a lot of time working with games to discover new and unique ways to cheat them. We will typically reserve these custom-made cheats for our premium members for a short period of time after they are released. Once this waiting period is over, the cheats are released to the public for all to enjoy. Some cheats do not get released to the public and are created as a value-added bonus for our premium members. Signing up and supporting our site allows us to continue spending the time necessary to create these unique and powerful cheats week after week. We also update the cheats when new patches are released and support all of the cheats we create on our message boards. "

No-one should support you asslicking faggots who expect payment for something that you literally stole from freeware trainers in 90%+ of the cases.

Deny it all you like, but we already know your sorry game. Die in a fire."
,kambieb,2012-09-20T04:36Z,people should just learn how to use cheat engine and be done with it ^^
