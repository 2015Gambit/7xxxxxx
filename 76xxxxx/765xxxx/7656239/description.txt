Notes:

We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe Default)
As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain
Games During Rebuild.
Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe
Creates Is C:/Games/
This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe.
If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone.
Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming.
(So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
