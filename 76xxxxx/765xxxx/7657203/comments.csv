you read my mind. I was in the middle of downloading ""Moonrise Kingdom"" by SiNNERS [PublicHD] at 4.3GB, and then I saw yours at 1.3GB.
Thanks for sparing my hard drive.

If you can, there is a 1080p version of ""The Mission"" at 7.1 GB. It looks really good on a large screen, but 7.1 GB?!... It would certainly benefit from your shrinking treatment, at this site:

This would make a lot of fans very (✿◠‿◠) happy."

M- ＼（´Ｏ｀）ᕗyawn!  Thanks dellefs0.

@ mossrite, I agree wholeheartedly. 
I think I've found the appropriate emoticon for a boring movie.  ＼（´Ｏ｀）ᕗyawn!"

Cheers!"
