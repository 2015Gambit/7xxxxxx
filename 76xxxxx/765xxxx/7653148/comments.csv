[T],HighCode,2012-09-20T00:20Z,"""Come on....DONT"" take it so seriously mate.
The way you write (capital letters & a couple of exclamation marks) shows what a loser you are lol, trying to look clever what an important discovery you made here.

Indeed they are not duology but so what?, I'm so terribly sorry, I hope you won't stub me to death for it. 
I haven't seen the second movie (yet I shared it with you) and I made the torrent in rush without checking the reviews. 

Nevertheless they do belong together and most likely all of us would want to see both movies (not just one) and would keep them together on pc, as if they were sisters lol, or duology (even if it bothers you). Just like Hulk & The Incredible Hulk (2003, 2008), one wants them both (not just one) and preferably in the same folder even though they are not duology..
