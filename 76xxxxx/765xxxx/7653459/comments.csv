,michaelmotes,2012-09-21T01:09Z,"This movie is lost. It is essentially a critique of uber wealthy people, that ironically, only holds water or has any reality with about 1% of people."
,christoph.thomas,2012-09-21T02:13Z,yeah for those that need another spiderman flick this is certainly not the movie to watch ... anyways nice quality - thanks for sharing !

@baratbatpo 

woah wait a minute dude. that hurts, you don't accuse people of liking twilight without some facts. 

I don't think the movie is awesome, i thought it was ok, it wans't even original cause southland tales was a bit like this. 

but i think it is a bit overcompensation for being stupid and retarded coming and saying ""OH AVOID THIS SHIT, 0, 0, i give it 0, oh so many zeros, AVOID AVOID!!!!!"". 

we get it, ""You didn't get it"", i mean i don't get ""the notebook"", i don't go giving it zero and warning ev one to avoid it. 
"
,busymommy,2012-09-21T07:43Z,thank you
,ProphetZarquon,2012-09-21T08:03Z,"I do.
I give the notebook a 0 and want everyone to avoid it.

Then again, I liked Iron Sky, so who am I to judge?
This movie has something important to say, it just doesn't say it very well.

No love for the Bourgeoisie, but this movie just isn't very good."
,siebsx,2012-09-21T09:41Z,A/V 10/10 but this movie is horrible. 
,JarjarTwink,2012-09-21T13:29Z,"@azzwipe74, 

I will use them money i got from fucking your mom to go see this movie in the cinema. 

fag hating is so 1999. you fucking al-qaida."
,HiDef1080p,2012-09-21T15:30Z,"YAY! Another movie about pole smoking! 2% of the population is gay yet a much higher % of movies/tv shows promote homosexuality. It's an agenda. Just because I don't want to watch two dudes fall in love doesn't make me a hater, it just makes me want to vomit. @twink, nice job DEFINING yourself with your sexuality! ""Look at me! I'm gay!"" "
,Glenn_K9,2012-09-21T15:35Z,"Awesome rip for sure.  Quality is superb!!
The movie....it's def out there.  I'm so damn intelligent/rich I'm going to throw everything I'm thinking out there and live in my limo...just weird.

A/V- 10
M- 3"
,JarjarTwink,2012-09-21T16:07Z,"dude, i'm not gay. i just think the name is funny. the most hated character in movie-verse, jar jar, and the most annoying sub groupe in gay community ""the twink"".  

and your ""gay"" statistics is wrong, estimates are about 10% and it's probabaly more because a lot of homo people live in closet, like tom cruise. 

And, 30-40% of movies are action movies, does it mean 40% of population have action filled lives? the entertainment one consumes dosen't have to corelate to how people are. 

i agree there is a lot of gays in tv, movies since sex and the city but it's a phaze, ppl will get tired and it'll be something else. 

and you talk like an american, brainwashed and whipped into a frenzie thinking all kind of people are trying to get into your head and forcing their agendas like dog penis in your mouth. It's just money, gay stuff sells now, that's why they produce it. 


and, and, lastley =), there is NO gay stuff in this movie. cosmopolis, he just gets a prostate exam, but other then that he just fucks women, what is gay with that?

,Countdesade,2012-09-21T17:37Z,Sounds like a dry movie
,nairobi19,2012-09-21T19:55Z,"downloaded this because there was a naked black booty in the trailer. once i find that ass and fap to it,  i will delete and stop seeding."
,bob-420,2012-09-21T20:14Z,"I suppose since I actually downloaded this, and I'm not gay, I can't comment on it ?  Haha, what a bunch of douche baggery going on on TPB...I only come to TPB to read the comments, because every single time I get anything from TPB, I get a copyright infringement from ""attorneys"", whether it was anonymously dl'd or old or whatever.  It might be in Sweden land of copyright free, but it sucks ass otherwise.   
I do love how a/v comments turn into a rage against the machine most of the time.  
This movie did suck for the most part...the action scenes looked like soap opera choreography, and the plot was lame as well.
quality is good though   =D

A/V= 9"

,JarjarTwink,2012-09-21T21:59Z,"@bob-420 

But the hate and ""you like dickery"" at pirate bay has class, sometimes. i also came a lot of times to pb just to read the comments. but then i thought i get into the action. =) 

i do get tired of all the gay bashing from these tweens 12 year old pre-pubescent coconut dream motha fuckers, so i thought why not pick a super gay name. 

""I'm batman""

at least it's better then youtube. i NEVER comment there. Youtube feels like india, it's to crowded.

,otis43,2012-09-22T10:50Z," @bob-420. TPB has nothing to do with your IP being exposed. That would be the fault of your torrent client. IE Utorrent,etc. The only way to protect your IP from being exposed is through the use of VPN's etc. Do the research. Also look into where your letters are really coming from. Most likely its a chicken shit ISP covering their ass."

,Savre,2012-09-23T04:08Z,"Its a decent film but its really pretentious. I think its pacing and its attempt to be intellectual reduces its appeal. The pacing alone will loose most people within the 1st half hour.
