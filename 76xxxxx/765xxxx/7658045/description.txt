These are worked out example problems that can be found for free on the iTunes store from MIT. They're meant as further supplementry material for the course tought on Multivariable Calculus which is also available for free and has been made into a torrent elsewhere. Hope this is helpful for you guys. Videos are listed alphabetically and not by order as listed in the iTunes store. I currently don't have the time to order them as such.
