,gforcemayhem,2012-09-25T10:01Z,It seems to stop abruptly after 10 mins of play time. What did I do wrong here?????
,radurall,2012-09-26T11:08Z,@ gforcemayhem  maybe your PC is overheating - try lower Video settings
,likeitis69,2012-09-26T11:15Z,"""It seems to stop abruptly after 10 mins of play time. What did I do wrong here?????""

Skidrow, Update 1, 3DM - all do the same basic crap for me. Start a new game and it performs GREAT for 20-30 minutes then freezes with audio looping. Corrupts system memory. Load game and same thing happens again in 10 secs with nothing happening! Tried 3 different nVidia drivers. So I think we did nothing wrong and they released a surprisingly good port suffering from a surprisingly bad bug."
,gforcemayhem,2012-09-27T06:03Z,"getting ""corruption error"" this thing took so long to download.=("
,nefariousP1G,2012-09-27T07:27Z,installed everything thats on the nosTEAM site. but it still keeps telling me MSVCR100.dll is missing. anyone got any idea where i went wrong?
