,Rexter007,2012-09-22T04:43Z,"Two weeks earlier, another ""early"" release Fall season episode was shown on Australia's SBS channel! I was amazed! (it showed the Cliffhanger bridge jump myth glimpsed in the Fall season trailer!) How did we get these episodes early? We can even rewatch them on SBS on demand website!"
