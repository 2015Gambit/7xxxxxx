Adam and Jamie attempt to improve the lives of commercial airline passengers by testing the most efficient and effective ways of boarding a plane. To investigate, they mock up an exact replica of the interior of a 173-seat plane, complete with a full crew of professional flight attendants and volunteer passengers. The results could change the way everyone flies! Meanwhile, Kari, Grant and Tory try and get away with murder by fooling a forensic pathologist with a bullet made of teeth.
