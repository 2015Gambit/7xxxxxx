Requirements: Android 3.2+
Overview: Chameleon is a revolutionary tablet-specific launcher that lets you create multiple home screens, each with your own layout of widgets and apps. The Chameleon system includes an innovative context based home screen system giving you the most relevant information that you want, when you want it.


The Next Generation of Widgets.

Android widgets are not all created equally - and that's the problem - so we decided to raise the bar. The result is widgets that look beautiful together and are as easy to layout as drawing on a screen. Take a look at some of our other widgets or build your own with our custom API.

App Tray & Launcher
Chameleon doesn't just let you customize your Home Screens with the widgets you want. It also lets you customize your own mini App Tray. Giving you the apps you want up front, without having to swim through a large grid of apps.
