,s33rial,2012-09-23T18:54Z,Really crappy video quality but I think that it might be the actual movie that was made grainy like that in order to look like an old vintage footage. Can anyone confirm it?
,happynick,2012-09-24T18:02Z,This is one hell of a boring movie... Zzz
,happynick,2012-09-24T18:03Z,Seriously... really baaaad movie. Could not watch more than 45 min...
,TeesDuns,2012-09-24T22:09Z,"This was a great movie, great copy too. If you enjoyed Royal Tenenbaums, you will probably like this too. It has Wes Anderson's style all over it. If you have Transformer's 3 in your queue, you probably won't like it."
,delaslow,2012-09-25T09:47Z,"Wonderful movie. Makes me wish for simpler times, nonetheless, definitely recommended.
