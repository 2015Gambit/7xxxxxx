Book Description

SOA Patterns provides architectural guidance through patterns and antipatterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic problem/solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.

The idea of service-oriented architecture is an easy one to grasp and yet developers and enterprise architects often struggle with implementation issues. Here are some of them:

    How to get high availability and high performance
    How to know a service has failed
    How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services
    How to make loose coupling looser
    How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers
    How to integrate SOA and the UI

SOA Patterns provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others, using plain language. YouΓÇÖll understand the design patterns that promote and enforce flexibility, availability, and scalability. Each of the 26 patterns uses the classic problem/solution format and a unique technology map to show where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.
