QG 64 ΓÇô Properties of Gravity

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The various properties of Gravitation are examined through the equilateral geometry of Tetryonics

The Gravitational constant, Inertial vs. Gravitational mass, the Weak equivalence principle and action-at-a-distance are all viewed geometrically

The sixty-fourth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
