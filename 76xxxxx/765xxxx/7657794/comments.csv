[V],psspss,2012-09-21T08:28Z,"he had nothing to do with the sources as they werent even mp4s 

but yeah they like to bitch in here about naming quality and sources tags so never know"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T08:30Z,"ive already got another new dude bitching in storage wars.. lol never ends.. they so rude in here
they have no clue whats involved in sourcing stuff and making the formats.. all they bitch about is its no HD"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T09:08Z,I saw the storage wars comment.some people just like to bitch
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T09:18Z,"I like high quality stuff as much as the next guy,but I'm in my mid 30s,I grew up on VHS & BETAmax.as long as the picture is clear I can't complain"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T09:20Z,:O lol I can see comments count going up but cant see the comments.. is it just me gets that issue here
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T09:25Z,"not me I watch only on portable devices now days comfy to lay on bed with a laptop 

plus I dont think its right HD are uploaded as its competing in the market place quality wise and causing problems now on torrent sites hosting it.. 
with media going after them,,,

I just wish they learn and offer the shows online
world wide and no itunes rubbish and cost of 3 bucks each.. its too greedy and crappy

I rather watch a shit quality download then pay for itunes prices.. not that we can get it of course.. you can source UK and USA shows are they air unless you live in  that country"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T10:22Z,we get UK shows here on tv & itunes but no AU shows.depending on where you are you can get Mexican & Canadian shows on tv if your close to the border aswell.
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T10:31Z,"as they air I meant.

have to try for a earlier night tonight :)"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T10:35Z,"i would pay $5 for a whole season but not per episode.. and I would rather get it legally myself
but theres just no sensible options for it

if only could pay a monthly small fee to download usa shows and even use sky id to download
the cable shows without promos and ads.. 

you see all these shows get cancelled but
im sure if the counted a proper download option
they see many shows have a following world wide and wouldnt cancel them..

stargate atlantis was one to name a few"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T10:38Z,"think we never got season 2 aired where im at on cable of TAP it got canned after that

never seen half rhe shows here on our air waves

as for paranormal prob have seen maybe 3 of the 30 or more shows on local tv"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T11:21Z,"

,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T11:38Z,I know what you ment.we have a channel called BBC America on cable & DirecTV that plays shows as they air but by our time frame.....5 hour deley I think...
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T11:42Z,:O
,rgregb,2012-09-21T11:56Z,"First off... THANK YOU!!
We appreciate your efforts... why ANY dil-hole complains about ANY real, (and honestly described) torrent is beyond me. I think it's freaking GREAT that you go to this much effort for a butt-load of people that you'll never meet, that almost never say thanks for the FREE and often unavailable any other way shows... PLUS you always let us know pre download if it's not perfect.
Secondly... what program are you using to make such small and VERY watchable files?
Cheers bud and thanks again"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T12:49Z,"I answered it a few times..
visit this torrent one of the comments gives some details of tools

[V],psspss,2012-09-21T12:58Z,"these are 30 min episodes well.. 22min without ads is it.. so normally like pawn stars these should come out about 174mb range


can I leave you lot to it now.. I seed 1.6 ratio and i thinks its more then enough ive shared.. as I didnt have to share it after all.. I could liek most grab it and kept it to myself

16 seeding now with me?"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T13:00Z,"plus Im getting tired again

might watch these now myself before bed"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T13:07Z,"

HEREs a great tip.. no matter what xvid you watch and the quality.. you can improve it heaps if use
VLC1.11.1 and enable its real time sharpener

slide knob across until looks better not too much
els eit will go pixelled
but great if its a TVRIP thats slightly blurry like this sources were"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-21T13:43Z,"LOL,I love that movie.the worst part is that I know people that are realy like that....without the singing of course :)"
[V],psspss,2012-09-22T02:47Z,:P
