,chrede2750,2012-09-20T13:29Z,"Hey................................

                         or 9? 
´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´
i cant find any episodes from 10-18?
only 1-8 season 2 and now 19? "
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T13:35Z,"no its ep19 there is no S02E09 scene have them named wrong

ep20 or if using wrong naming S02E10
hasnt aired.. they back to do one episodes a week instead of 2..

if confuse see the episode guide at A&e

they list this as ep26 under season 2.. but they means its ep26 overall polits and seasons and specials

26-(6 for season 1)-(1 for pilot or was it a special)= 19 for Season 2"
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T13:40Z,"opps typos getting tired now.. you know what I mean though.

URLS there it will take you to production site
guide and the naming if still confused"

,chrede2750,2012-09-20T16:50Z,"Hey, that sounds weird

but now there came one and it's called Season 2 epidsode 9 and it is the same as yours. just in much better quality!"
[V],psspss,2012-09-20T17:37Z,"some people dont listen or read

scene have them numbered wrong if you go to ane website and click Season 1 it lists 6 episodes

if you go into s02 it list 19

everyone will have to rename their collections
if they dont listen so be it.. 


and I dont give a fook its better quality theres nothign wrong with this 360p rip

obviously tou another 50inch screener that wants HD and moans if its not.. not that you bothered sourcing it and take the risk to share the upload :)"
,andrewho,2012-09-20T22:05Z,"this idiot of an uploader gets defensive at everything..ppl compare the quality for the benefit of downloaders not to diss the uploader that his is bad..stupid arrogant turd..just get it from tvteam..better quality, less whining"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T04:33Z,"another tne turd coming here to stir trouble is it

if they got it from tvteam they would of had to wait 3 days for it

I dont know why I bother here.. theres too many teeny moaning about baby things like quality

why dont you go and grab and rip it yourselves then since your such a clever bunch

ungrateful sods"
[V],psspss,2012-09-21T04:44Z,"your comment is lame and just nasty

i like to add im not the one moaning.. its some of the downloaders about its not being HD
considering 200 are seeding it and 1 in a 1000s moans they show themselves up

HD does not means HQ.. else it would be called

HDwerbrip not HQwebrip

but im made it clear on the naming now
i know its hard for other cappers egos to admit
they are wrong
"
,chrede2750,2012-09-24T13:13Z,"You do not need to get mad,
I'm just saying, that's how it is in my collection of series and movies, I have put this section as episode 9 - Season 2 in storage wars texas!
that's how I can keep track of new sections.

BUT I know what you mean;)"
