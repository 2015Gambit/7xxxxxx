,Nietmust,2012-09-26T03:08Z,This is not a fake you idiots. Maybe best copy out there at the moment.
,gabriel1475,2012-09-27T17:46Z,"huh? Whats not fake about it, genius?

Its another TS

liars!"
,Nietmust,2012-09-28T03:28Z,"Yes its TS ,but best quality I have seen so far. Saying fake and not anything else, give impression that it aint even correct movie.
How anyone can even expect anything else but cams if movie aint released yest anywhere else but cinemas."
,skoxpress,2012-09-29T00:54Z,"This really stinks. No English SRT and you need it because of poor audio. Web address on screen. 

A 30 second ""VIDEO"" sample sure would be nice. Looking at jpeg's AFTER you download doesn't help much.WTF is JYK besides the Japanese word aibo, which means â&#x20AC;&#x153;palâ&#x20AC;?. LOL"
,skoxpress,2012-09-29T01:41Z,"Maybe Nietmust is right and this is all you can expect until DVD rips start coming out.Having that Japanese URL really is distracting, though. I'll watch it tonight but forget about burning a copy."
