[S],soda,2012-09-27T08:00Z,"Your latest torrent has been deleted.  Not because it was ""spreading religious hatred"" but because it wasn't a porn picture as you had claimed it was.  ie. it was a fake torrent.  

We ban people for uploading fakes, so consider yourself extremely lucky.

If you want to host discussions, our forum (linked to in the footer of this page) would be a more appropriate place.

If you really want to upload torrents of image files containing single lines of text, Other > Other would be the appropriate category on TPB.  And take more care to give accurate titles and descriptions to whatever it is you do upload."
,sakstroy,2012-09-27T09:55Z,"
Please clarify, you deleted it because it wasn't a porn picture as I said it was, but I never claimed that, it was just a picture with text, which I jokingly suggested as the beginning of a new Quran. If I upload it again describing it as 'other' and with the previous description, would that be acceptable?
