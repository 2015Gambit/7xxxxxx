We know that Hitler didn┬┤t invent the swastika, 

he just saw it somewhere, liked it and then 

destroyed its ancient meaning and use by 

associating it to his unholy and murderous 

regime.



How far back and how wide was its ancient 

use by many civilizations?



This old book tells us all about it.
 






I can seed only for a short time, please seed 

to keep alive. Thanks.
