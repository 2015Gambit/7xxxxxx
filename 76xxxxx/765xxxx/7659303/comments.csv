,Tufa_911,2012-09-23T11:57Z,I don't get the BIN file format. Please explain!
,B0kk1e,2012-09-23T16:55Z,"I have created the image files from original CDs using Ultra ISO.

You need to burn the image to the CD by mounting the CUE file (which contains audio information), not the BIN one (which is an exact copy of the image data). Both files are required. I have tested it with both Ultra ISO and Nero and I have burned the images to CDRW and it does work properly. 

Hope this helps."
