,xidio,2012-09-22T02:01Z,ok yeah the quality is really really bad... why the hell put it in HIGH RES section when the quality is worse than older DVDs..
,rcr29budcar,2012-10-01T02:31Z,"     Wow! What a bunch of douche bags! I'm not even explaining why this is listed where it is again! Next time do a little reading or research before you post and show your ignorance!

     BTW, thanks TvTeam and all the other great uploaders who keep these awesome movies coming!  Your doin great! Keep up the good work and ignore all the haters, in no way do they speak for the majority!"
,ACAB1908,2012-10-03T18:07Z,"@rcr29budcar Yes they are...A dark movie like that,is simply IMPOSSIBLE to watch (AND enjoy) if not in a GOOD quality.And I don't want to see any ''go upload yourself something before you be negative ect.,because I've done that in the past,BUT I would insult people that don't want to pay a cinema ticket of the price of a cd for one-off 1,5-2 hours of film if I'd upload something without good quality.
Now,you have your opinion,let the others express theirs (even if you don't agree with that),instead of insulting people.Remember that everyone can be kick-ass infront of a pc monitor.Have a nice day."
,ACAB1908,2012-10-03T18:17Z,"I didn't know that there is censorship here as well.A comment without  insults just been deleted,thought some subhumans can still comment.Well,you are worthy of your subhuman intelligence.. "
