,MP4SUX,2012-09-22T04:01Z,"I agree - those script writers are truly terrible people. Almost wish I hadn't posted it.

Never liked the ""show the 'boom' and then 'y hours earlier'"" - it's a terrible plot point to say ""this is the best bit and everything after / before is never going to be this good.

Cheezy spoilers are never any good."
