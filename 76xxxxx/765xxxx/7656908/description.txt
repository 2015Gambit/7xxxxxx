2011-09-17 - Paul Godfrey - How To Overcome Sin:
This answers a simple question. The answer is actually just as simple. Yet to most Christians the answer is "that is impossible".


2012-06-09 - Paul Godfrey - Perfect Hatred:
It may surprise some to know that we are commanded to hate something as Christians. But what? Certainly not sinners. Watch this sermon and find out.


2012-07-07- Paul Godfrey - Apples and PCs:
The comparison of a computer to a human and it's creation, and eventual fall.


2012-07-21- Paul Godfrey - Satanic Christians:

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
