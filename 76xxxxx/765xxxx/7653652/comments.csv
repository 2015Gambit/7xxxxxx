,Linus371,2012-09-20T16:30Z,"Downloaded and it works.
The problem though is that my computer doesn't recognize the file type, to solve this I just had to add .zip to the end of the file and it worked!
Now to have some fun :D"

As the other user said you DO have to rename the end of it to .zip or.rar, and archiving extension. 

If it doesn't work make sure you have this off ""Hide file extensions for known file types. Somewhere in there you'll find the right setting. 

Anyway great upload, fast speeds here in New Zealand. "
