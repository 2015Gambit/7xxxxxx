The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game builds on more than 10 years of system development and the largest open playtest in the history of tabletop gaming to create an unparalleled fantasy roleplaying experience. Players need only the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook to play, but Paizo Publishing produces a wide range of books and accessories to enhance your Pathfinder experience, from hardcover rules compendiums to complete campaigns to packets of beautiful full-color maps.

This release includes:
Ultimate Equipment
Shattered Star - Shards of Sin
Magnimar, City of Monuments
Blood of Angels
Varisia, Birthplace of Legends

The rest of July & August releases will show up sooner or later. Be patient.
