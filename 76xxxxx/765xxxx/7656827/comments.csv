,cturtle41,2012-09-21T03:18Z,I don't think I've ever anticipated a torrent as much as this one. Thanks!
,kbfore,2012-09-21T03:42Z,Been waiting a while for this. Thanks
,giggedyguy,2012-09-21T05:40Z,Quality is okay. Maybe a 7 for the video. Didn't watch enough to judge the audio. I'm not crazy about AbsurdiTy releases. Wait for CM8 or Alliance if you want great quality.
,Ext_in_use,2012-09-21T06:16Z,"Thank You, i've been waiting to see this for a long time, i loved the movie!, Video and audio are both a 10 as far as i am concerned"
,sammyboblammy,2012-09-21T06:25Z,"Well its a BR rip made to a 700mb size so it won't be the most amazing quality. There are quite a few larger size uploads if anyone is looking. 
I am just happy this finally came out. I was watching the Spanish version with Russian subs trying to translate heh. "

,lraec,2012-09-21T11:34Z,This movie is brillant
,MacMetally,2012-09-21T14:12Z,"Movie was amazing definitely my second favorite right behind Life Aquatic, Not as funny much more heartwarming though. Bruce Willis at times seemed a bit uncomfortable in a Wes' world but still good performance and Ed Norton fit right in but he is not new to this type of role.

Anywhos great quality but I support my Wes I'll be picking up the BluRay sometime soon keep up with my collection :) Thx"

,Plyshkin,2012-09-22T09:41Z,"Yes amza, Islam is clearly peace, we can see that by the way the middle east is burning itself down in protest against freedom of speech."
,arildus,2012-09-22T12:42Z,Funny movie:)
,hawkesk57,2012-09-22T15:51Z,Rotten Tomatoes claimed 90% of the people who watched it liked it.

,lati7efa,2012-09-22T23:11Z,"@Plyshkin, the thing that you don't get is that islam is not only represented by the middle east, and not all muslims agree with what they do"
,vickouleta,2012-09-22T23:40Z,Thanks!!!
,srkaren,2012-09-23T00:51Z,Thank you for your hard work.  I so appreciate the size.  God bless you all.
,vegamax,2012-09-23T06:13Z,that just defies the laws of averages
,agdagd,2012-09-23T09:17Z,Islam is represented by a very small country called pakistan - and look at those people - creater of taliban and all islamic terrorist of the world and all the bad matters of world.. no matter where they are in world - they always mean trouble and best to avoid. people who have taken islam as their religion just have lost their identity. its being taken by wrong faith and wrong reasoning. So pure world must not have pakistani people.
,Plyshkin,2012-09-23T10:01Z,"Islam is being misrepresented the world over, this can be seen not just in Pakistan, but also in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Lebenon, Tunisia, Afghanistan... what world view of Islam is this creating? All of the violence has been carried out in the name of the prophet Muhammad. Islam is now characterized to the world as a religion of anger, hatred and violence. There is also growing fear in the west of Islam because of this unchecked violence and hatred. Therefore, how can it be said in this day and age that Islam represents peace?"
,wasifkhalid,2012-09-23T11:51Z,"""FUKUNT ""
you are a piece of shit."
,vladip123,2012-09-23T15:43Z,"agdagd  
U are such dumb idiot.

Plyshkin
U as well.

Why they started all this shit in first place?
It is all about money and dominance. Nothing else. 
One that profits out of wars is same one that started all charade. Just check whose capital entered in all these countries after war finished.

,CarlZeiss,2012-09-26T04:00Z,"a/v = 10

thx for the upload

I would have loved this movie a lot more if I was 11.  I'm a big Anderson fan but this one was for a younger audience I think."
,Atom_Engineer,2012-09-26T12:59Z,"totally disagree about liking this more if i were younger, anderson had kids acting out some serious  issues, no matter what age, who hasnt just wanted to run away with someone u care deeply  for?"
,WarpSpeedSulu,2012-09-26T19:26Z,Video's not the greatest.

,arrr_a_pirate,2012-09-28T18:30Z,"@rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr pharkit
Don't fucking lie to people bro
actually if you had even bothered to watch the full movie, bruce willis kills the child - absorbs the soul over a 5 minute & in my opinion heavily overacted display of what looked like bruce willis ""jizzing in his pants"" while he absorbed the childs pure soul.
He then turns into a ball of blue light & the scene ends & the credits roll.
If you watch till the credits end..
The ball appears in a brightly lit white room with nothing in it but a chair...and whois sitting on that chair?
yep...fucking morgan freeman...
the camera angle changes to show both the ball of light & freeman in the shot - freeman said ""Welcome to heaven Detective Mclain""...

fucking bruce willis comes rolling out of the blue light wearing nothing his underpants & a torn wife beater, brandishing 2 pistols screaming ""yiippiekiayemotherfucker"" as he unleashes an amount of ammunition one would think impossible from the 6 bullet capacity of most 6 shooters...
the final shot is of freemans ""aka god"" face with a shocked expression before his face is riddled with poor cgi generated bullet holes which spell out words...words that read...
DIE HARD XXXV - DIEHARD, WITH A MESSAGE, A MESSAGE FOR GOD.
sorry for the spoiler folks.
Good upload hero
