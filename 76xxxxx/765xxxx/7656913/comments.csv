I don't know, though I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work."
,Metalheadlover,2012-09-23T03:04Z,"I just got it, did everythign step by step, but when I start the game it tells me to entre in the D3 key and the RoE key (which I already did during install). When I try the same one again, it says invalid, if I select cancel, it exits the game? What Do I do?"

Strange since the instructions are flawless and supposed to work... 
But you can always read what many people have commented before for those who need help:

If you're wondering, that is the link to my old torrent. Difference is that this new torrent has been re-packed and have updated files :)

So feel free to read those comments from there and apply them to this new torrent, though my install description actually do work. Maybe you should try to reinstall the game again?"
