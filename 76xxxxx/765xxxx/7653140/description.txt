Why UnInstaller?
 
Your system is ever-changing
 Every application you install makes changes to your system. Data gets copied to your hard disk, values are added to your Windows Registry database. Most programs also create temporary files during operation.
 
Default uninstallation facilities are unreliable
 In many cases, registry changes and temporary files are left behind when applications are uninstalled through Windows' default uninstallation facilities. These leftovers gradually clutter up your file system and degrade the performance of your PC.
 
Supported OS:
 
Windows XP, Windows Vista (32bit/64bit), Windows 7 (32bit/64bit).
