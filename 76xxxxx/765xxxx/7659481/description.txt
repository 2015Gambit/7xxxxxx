Release Notes

Welcome to the Basic Algorithm audio
dimension. We proudly present our debut sonic
voyage 'Tribal Mechanics' dedicated to crazy
dusty nomads all over the word.

Our crew carefully transferred it's deep
knowledge of the trance scene into these
beautifully packed selection of 10 cutting
edge full power tracks by different
international artist for your ultimate
pleasure. Flowing one into another each track
tells it's own tribal story in a dance music
form with a strong psychedelic touch and good
feeling inside.

Stories about eternity, transcendence and
similarity of all spiritual beings of Mother
Earth. Basic algorithms of life and joy will
always be the same and we are happy to share
this blasting, emotional and dynamic journey
through the sound worldwide. Join it if you
can!
