,NoMad17,2012-09-26T01:33Z,"Just ordered the physical CD for 15 smackers (not counting shipping) I'm torrenting to get them before the CD gets here.

I firmly believe in pirating for a billion legit reasons, that said she isn't an RIAA backed musician and she totally deserves every single bit of money we can get going in her direction.

Mayhaps we can pull are piraty weight and see just how many of us criminals we can bring to pay for her music. I think it would be damned hilarious."
