WHAT IS IT?


This edit uses the content of the following torrent as a base: 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6428673/

Using careful sound editing and a tool called "Perfect Declipper", this version of the track features digitally reconstructed audio of the clipped portions of the stream.

It is important to note that the Perfect Declipper tool is really intended to be used during real-time playback rather than as a sound-editing plug-in, however, while it may be the best at what it does, it does alter the entire waveform and not just clipped audio. This edit takes that into account and preserves the original audio stream as much as possible, and only samples at or very near the clipping level are different than that of the original stream. This preservation procedure very slightly affected the attenuation of the reconstructed samples.

This version is intended solely for audiophiles. Its use will only be feasible in ReplayGain-enabled players such as foobar2000. Non-ReplayGain-enabled players will play this track at half of its original volume.
