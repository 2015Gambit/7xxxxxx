[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-20T04:55Z,Thank you sir .  Is this the extended version ? 
[V],DownTYU,2012-09-20T05:26Z,"No this is theatrical, best quality yet. extended might pop in a few days."
,kellogg9,2012-09-20T05:39Z,Technically this is not true 1080p but its better than the other versions so good enough for me.
,jeepers81,2012-09-20T06:01Z,"no is 1080p version?

waiting for true.

where to look when it comes out the version 1080p?"
,whatdestroys,2012-09-20T06:02Z,Seed! How come there's almost 300 seeders and no one is seeding?
,sdsucks,2012-09-20T06:52Z,"pq's very bad especially in dark areas.
encoded with a very old version of x264(x264 core 65 r1066M 045ae40) and not-so-good x264 options."
,hsinghg,2012-09-20T06:53Z,"@kellogg9: if u are saying that its width is not 1080 pixels and so its not ""true"" 1080p, ur a dumbass. The black bars are cropped from the bluray releases. 

If u mean its not true because its not 40GB or more, feel free to download all that when it comes out.

This is the best quality-wise this movie is ever going to get, though i wud advise everyone to watch the extended version only(abt 20 mins extra), since the theatrical version is somewhat unsatisfying(in its incompleteness)."
,ragcsalo,2012-09-20T10:58Z,"@jeepers81: arggghhh.... :-)

You know, 1080p means the width of the video is 1920 pixels. The naming is a bit confusing... If the movie has 16:9 aspect ratio, it can be either 1.77:1, 1.85:1 or 2.39:1. Depending on the aspect ratio the height of the movie varies from 1080 to 800 (or so). The bottom line is: if you see a movie with a width of 1920 pixels, it IS ""1080p"" indeed.

Same applies to 720p: if the width is 1280, we call it 720p, no matter the real height.... I hope I could clear up the confusion! :-)"
,ragcsalo,2012-09-20T10:59Z,"Sorry, I meant to address this to kellogg9!! :-)"
,schnitzelburger,2012-09-20T11:20Z,"So, the extended version is supposed to be better? Because in cinema the movie sucked big time. Had great expectations, but unfortunately Prometheus is a huge disappointment. Lots of CGI, but storywise it's like a B-movie. Flat characters, wooden dialogs, implausible plot arcs and trite religious propaganda bullcrap. The movie's problem is the script. Writer Lindelof is a zealot Jew. He sucked as a writer for LOST. And here he sucks again."
,Jehrahl,2012-09-20T16:08Z,Any chance to full BR? I want to see all extras...
,Ajube0476,2012-09-20T17:00Z,"kellogg9 is an idiot .. don't listen to him people. 
He goes on every 720p/1080p torrent trying to say they aren't really 1080p/720p because he doesn't understand how torrents work.
The black bars are cropped to make the file size smaller. It is still the same pixels on the screen for the movie."
,ramenfreak,2012-09-20T22:06Z,"@Ajube - you are retarded: ""The black bars are cropped to make the file size smaller"". Riiiight..."
,Revisionist,2012-09-20T23:23Z,My understanding is that there is NO extended version.  Only deleted scenes.  If Scott does one it wont be out anytime soon
,gozinya,2012-09-20T23:26Z,"Is this an ""actual"" 1080p BRrip, or an upscaled 720p web dl?"
,bordo84,2012-09-20T23:29Z,almost 9000 is really such a little kbps for this kind of movie...this need more kbps....i better wait for some more quality rip at least 13000 kbps because there are many dark scenes for sure.. 
,gozinya,2012-09-20T23:48Z,"@Ajube, WTF is up with you anyway? Everything you post is ""don't listen to him"" or some other obnoxious insult. Believe it or not people actually have minds of their own and are capable of making their own decisions. Constructive advice is one thing but all the dissing just makes you look like an immature little dick."
,tpbuser8,2012-09-21T00:19Z,This is a BluRay rip.  Looks pretty good on my Samsung LED TV!
,bordo84,2012-09-21T01:08Z,sdsucks - like you said...i better wait for some better rip
,Ajube0476,2012-09-21T01:22Z,"@gozinya i don't owe you any explanations.. and using profanity towards me doesn't help your case. You deserve no further reply.
@ramenfreak I take it by your insult directed at me you think I'm wrong.. well unfortunately (for you) it's you who is mistaken. 
So many ignorant people to correct.. so little time in each day. ta ta :)"
,gozinya,2012-09-21T02:04Z,"Ajube, I don't want or need your explanations, or help with ""my case"". This a sharing community of like-minded peers, and you are a dark cloud trying to intentionally irritate people. I really thought you'd take a hint. What...your dad, big brother, bigger kids at school kick your ass too many times? The only way you feel better is by trying to do unto others what was done to you? There are people out there to help you with that, and they aren't here. Man, I wish I was telling you this in person...I bet you'd shut the fuck up pretty damn fast."

,SR4T9US,2012-09-21T23:02Z,"Ajube0476 , Who the fuck elected you to be king of PB? fucking know it all huh? If there's too much ignorance for you here, skip the fuck on somewhere else. BTW, don't see any torrents under your name..."
,CJoMin,2012-09-22T03:02Z,"@gozinya
You need to relax. You're accusing him of giving others so much clout, yet you don't hesitate to do the same thing. Isn't that odd? You chided him for ""do[ing] unto others what was done to [him]"" (per your words), yet you're guilty of the same thing for riddling your comment with attacks as a response to his attack.

I'm not saying you're wrong. Perhaps Ajube really does need to take a step back, but what I am saying is that you should take a step back as well."
,gozinya,2012-09-22T04:02Z,"@CJoMin, Yeah, I bite back when attacked, you betcha. I'm not out here to give anyone shit, I share something here and there, give a bit of advice if I can, never have an unkind word to say to anyone. This isn't the first time this asshole has responded to my posts with insults like he wants to pick a fight, and I've seen him do the same shit to tons of other people as well. I'm sick of seeing his derogatory crap, so I'm calling him on it. Maybe he'll fuck off and go post on obnoxiousfucktards.com."

,qwytkewl,2012-09-22T08:13Z,Great picture.  I have a full 1080 p monitor and it looks great to me.  A good friend taught me how to download torrents before he died suddenly.  I guess I'm a padawan who needs a master to teach me all about this.  He also preferred TPB so I've almost exclusively used it.  If I see BOZX I know I'm getting really great quality.  And the Subs are a big plus because I don't hear to well.  Thanks BOZX!!!
,Sunseeker908,2012-09-22T15:34Z,Does anyone know if this movie is infected with Cinavia?
,Spankinator94,2012-09-22T19:31Z,"To all those saying: ""stop complaining about quality of free stuff.""

Well, were not complaining, were reviewing so that other PB users can see if the torrent is good by someone who has used/seen the material in the torrent. Also so that the uploader can read the comments and see what to focus on to improve, audio/video quality, etc.

I have not yet seen this movie and I'm currently downloading at 2mbps.

YIFY and BOZX always have nice uploads, I suggest sticking to one uploaders"

They are some glitches, the compression it's not of the best and the bitrate it's not very high for an 1080p."
,bordo84,2012-09-26T17:29Z,Dardouk - thanks for some answer..i also think that this bitrate is too low for this kind of movie with many dark scenes especially when you want to have 1080p that´s why i´m waiting for better version too..compression can be good but with this bitrate you can´t expect any miracles 
,CJoMin,2012-09-26T19:44Z,"@gozinya
I decided to search whether Ajube0476 told the truth. I can't determine if his reasons for posting were mockery and self-indulgence since I don't know him, but I know you're wrong. Hell, I doubt he's the troll you claim him to be. His initial comment is hardly incendiary -- and he spoke the truth (cropping the black bars reduces the size of the file). You never once tried to debunk his post; you just relentlessly harpooned him with inane insults. Sorry, but as it stands, Ajube0476 isn't the ""immature little dick"" you say he is; you are. Also, don't tell me that you ""bite back when attacked"" (verbatim); you bared your fangs at him first, and he just shooed you away like a pest. "
,muppet99,2012-09-26T19:51Z,"Don't blame us all Walliance ;)
Tnx Bozx, perfect as always"
,gozinya,2012-09-26T20:21Z,"@CJoMin, dude, you need to brush up on your reading here. I never offered any comment on Ajube's ""black bars"" post, or said he was wrong, so what exactly you think I'm wrong about is a mystery. What I can tell you is that each and every comment Ajube posts contains an insult. I have NEVER attacked anyone here, I have ONLY responded to Ajube's repeated attacks toward me and others. If I post advice or an opinion to help someone out, there's Ajube calling me a noob or an idiot almost every damned time. I post a torrent, and there he is dissing me like he has some kind of personal vendetta. I've seen him do the very same thing to others as well, and I am only calling him out on his own obnoxious crap, it's that simple. I don't know the guy, and if he didn't come at me first and continue to do so I would never have anything to say to him. Period."
,gozinya,2012-09-26T20:25Z,he has posted derogatory comments on many other torrents besides this one.
,gozinya,2012-09-26T20:40Z,"When I ""bared my fangs"" at him it was hardly the 1st time he had insulted me. He had already initiated his obnoxious tirade on many other torrents spurring me to respond in defense."
,CJoMin,2012-09-26T21:24Z,"@gozinya
What is wrong with you?
He said someone else was wrong in saying this file isn't true 1080p; then, you attacked him by calling him an ""immature little dick"" (your words).
1. How did you delude yourself into thinking that isn't an insult?
2. How does that qualify as Ajube attacking you first? Whether he attacked you on another page is a different, irrelevant matter (gasp!). Here, on this page, you started it.
If you actually didn't care whether Ajube was right (which you just implied) and still felt compelled to insult him, you only attacked for the sake of self-indulgence -- i.e., you just showcased typical ""immature little dick"" behavior.

This is the last time I'll ride this slippery slope. Getting caught in an internet argument is not how I intend to spend my time. "
,gozinya,2012-09-26T21:47Z,"Listen, This is very, very simple. I am not at issue with his information. I am at issue with his insulting demeanor. The guy insults me and other friendly people, I give him a taste of his own medicine. This torrent, other torrents, it makes no difference. You don't know the history of this crap or how it began. I don't want to argue with anybody, but I will not stay quiet while this guy continues to attack me. If he would just leave me the fuck alone I'll have nothing more to say."
,gozinya,2012-09-26T22:33Z,"So yes, obviously I am insulting him. I will never attack anyone without provocation, it's not my style. I insult him simply to show him what he's doing to others, that it sucks to be attacked and called names just because someone's opinion differs from his. He doesn't just say kellogg9 is wrong, he also calls him an idiot. I have seen him do this a million times and I'm just sick of it, so yeah I am insulting him back, guilty as charged."

,Skram0,2012-09-29T04:06Z,"@t_amante
The top/bottom bars are big because the aspect ratio of this film is 2.39:1. That's around 21:9.

Where The Avengers Blu-ray is 1.78:1, that's 16:9. Even though the original aspect ratio is 1.85:1 (about 17:9). There really should have been bars at the top/bottom of the Blu-ray release of Avengers. But I guess the Blu-ray people chose to crop the sides off instead.

Remember just because it's a 1080p movie doesn't mean it has to be 1920x1080. It can be 1920xAnything."

,the_darkmaster,2012-09-29T17:59Z,"Once and for all, folks: For a movie have exact 1920x1080 he must have a ratio of 16:9, and only some movies are filmed in that proportion. Most have 1920x800, 1920x900, etc.. So in summary, if the film is 1920x? then he IS 1080p.

As for this release, I concluded by comparison it is a upscale from 720p, so do not waste your time with it if you are looking for a real 1080p."
