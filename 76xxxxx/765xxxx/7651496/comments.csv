,DeathNimrod,2012-09-19T06:57Z,How is this 3.67gb? Seems really non-legit like the one with missing speech files
,Modestman,2012-09-19T07:07Z,Thanks for the repack!
,icekarsin,2012-09-19T07:20Z,What the fuck is wrong with the setup? It's entirely garbage characters.
,Huzewaze343,2012-09-19T07:25Z,"extremely fast download for the amount of leechers! thanks HeroMaster for the great repack and i cant wait to play this in an hour! i will post on here if its working and if it has no viruses and all that good stuff.

,trap205,2012-09-19T07:45Z,"@HeroMaster

Are the videos ripped or recoded?
Deos this work on windows 7?"
[T],tikasukaz,2012-09-19T07:49Z,"thanks a lot , was looking for this"
,Pink_Taco,2012-09-19T08:05Z,This is supposed to be all English but the installer is in Russian? 
,Steven93,2012-09-19T08:08Z,It's because it's English only if I'm gathering right. Just removed all the other languages.
,Huzewaze343,2012-09-19T08:35Z,The installer is russian =(
,OmniNegro,2012-09-19T08:43Z,"""Cut out logo designers, all languages other than English not recorded""

Can anyone answer if the videos/cutscenes are still in this? If not, then it is worthless. The normal version is just over 7GB to download. I cannot fathom the other language dialogs being almost half the size.

And anyone care to speculate on whether or not patches will work with this?

Thanks anyway HeroMaster. But I think I will pass. (I will wind up buying the game for multiplayer use. But I want to actually play it a bit before I throw my very limited income at it.)"
,Pink_Taco,2012-09-19T08:54Z,Russian or not I  still was able to install it but when it shows play i click on it and nothing ever happens. 
,tops.c,2012-09-19T09:16Z,It's the same as 4 other I have tried wont fucking launch. 
[H],HeroMaster,2012-09-19T13:33Z,"@If you guys having a problem in this torrent so do tell me i will remove it, from my side it is all working, be sure to copy paste the exe file on desktop then play as admin."
,neDav,2012-09-19T16:15Z,"It works!!!

But I had to download this crack to get it to work.

,k4m1k4z3_pt,2012-09-19T16:26Z,It's working ok for me. Thanks
,Pink_Taco,2012-09-19T18:33Z,neDav is right that did it
,Huzewaze343,2012-09-19T21:02Z,"@heromaster
Its working fine for me without having to download any other cracks, so i recommend leaving it on here since its the smallest torrent on here =)"
,Huzewaze343,2012-09-19T21:03Z,"@OmniNegro
It has all the movies and cutscenes, the only problem i have encountered is sometimes when i open it my mouse goes invisible which is annoying but restarting the game can fix it"
,kobby2k6,2012-09-20T06:26Z,"It works..just start the installer and click the right arrow and wait till it finishes...After that go to computer> local disk (C) > Program Files(x86) > R.G. World Games > BorderLands 2 > Binaries > Win32 > and finally click Borderlands 2...im currently at level 5 assasin and no bugs so far...

p.s.  If you search ""Borderlands 2"" in windows search..the game launcher doesn't appear..that is why you manually have to find the game launcher"
,kobby2k6,2012-09-20T06:30Z,What is the difference between this and the Black Box version..and i saw a 12 dlc version? wtf..
,br1ng1t0nh0,2012-09-20T23:20Z,not work !
,urretado,2012-09-21T05:48Z,"Had the same problem as Pink Taco. I've installed, but the game just won't start.
The process is killed as soon as it starts, running installdirectoryBinariesWin32Borderlands2.exe

I got the crack that nedav suggested, and now it's working."
,lolindir356,2012-09-21T18:05Z,"it works perfectly. the speech also there, only the radio station is missing i think. the lan also works. thanks guys."
,myprecious121,2012-09-21T20:34Z,"seed please, this is going way to slow :("
,shinzack,2012-09-23T10:07Z,"Those who want to take the starting RG blue colour Video thing they can delete the ""2k""file situated at 
WillowGame/Movies/, delete the first file"
,lolindir356,2012-09-24T12:42Z,"for those having problem to launch it, you have to have steam installed. you dont have to run it."
