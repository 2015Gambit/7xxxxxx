,r3lax,2012-09-18T23:57Z,"interesting...

,Afghanis,2012-09-19T00:08Z,"RevTT is keeping clean txt password :P

,stussy69,2012-09-19T02:18Z,lol my one was there dam basterds :)
,stonestar,2012-09-19T03:19Z,"SOrry to spoil the fun but a database attack is out of the question. The list of accounts is too small and has many repeated accounts, which makes no sense to be a database extract. Also there's no way they stored the info in plain text. Finally, I see several passwords too obsecure and complicated to have been brute force attacked. That leaves only a login intercept type attack, perhaps man in the middle network attack from another server local to the same DC? My account is fine, but i haven't used it in weeks, so unless you logged in recently I'd say you are good and won't find yourself on any list."
,army_strong,2012-09-19T03:22Z,"Hi,this dump is hurting a few friends of me,can you take some time to read this


I served
in your country as an infantryman, two tours  07-09 (with some time inbetween with my family etc)..I only respecfully want to ask you to reconsider having this one up here..if you guys really are thankful this is a way of showing it..

,brown_turd,2012-09-19T03:34Z,"so like why didn't you release them all?  In 1-2 weeks when you want to release the rest, the site will have already had all users change their pass.  one more question Afghanis, what is your favorite food?"
,buner2012,2012-09-19T04:15Z,"i am very happy that RevTT has finally met its nemesis. so much for their being pirates when they have banned most of the countries for bloody no reason... or may be it was for reasons of ""safety"" hahaha

i hate snobs like them and have left most of such bombastic trackers who do not put into practice the pirate motives:

""sharing is caring""
and
""share with ALL""

they deserve this... 
the model should be ""thepiratebay""... may its black ship forever sail the high waters with pride and success


hwever, it was amazing to see that ""afghanis"" did it.. they are my neighbors and i am happy they have such in-depth know how ..

khair shai halakano..

:d"
,wickedsicktm,2012-09-19T04:28Z,"My account isnt listed ive tried over 100 of these so far and none work, I think this is bs from some wanna be hackers lol Site is very safe and is a great addition to the torrenting community afganis is a faker wannb lmao"
,wickedsicktm,2012-09-19T04:32Z,none of these work at all
,itsdoodoobaby,2012-09-19T07:03Z,"definitely not legit, the password associated with my account was not correct.  In fact, my username was on there 4 times, with 4 different, incorrect passwords.  One of them was a game that I downloaded years ago.  Some kind of key logging fail maybe?  Either way, some of them were legit passwords, so...

Either way, your poor excuse for a hack did not destroy the site like you claim.  I don't see your problem with private sites either.  Faster downloads, no fake torrents, and a tighter community.  You mad bro?"
,leecheee,2012-09-19T07:58Z,"your full of shit afghanis, none of these users exists, get back in your cave and wait for our bomber.. looooooosers"
,phlebob,2012-09-19T11:06Z,non of these worked for me .
[V],sceneline,2012-09-19T13:48Z,but it works for me and for others who are not STAFF in RevTT haha thanks ffor giving me a free account afghanis 
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-09-19T13:59Z,I checked a username/password combo and I got one of the VIP accounts!! Didn't change the password though. Hope the owner returns and changes it back himself.

,jezus1234,2012-09-19T18:02Z,"Seems the site https://revolutiontt.me/

is dead now

cannot connect to it at all

;-("
,itsdoodoobaby,2012-09-19T18:24Z,"Not dead, they say they will be back by tomorrow while they sort this mess."
,FuckingMetal,2012-09-19T21:11Z,"Wow, at least my username wasn't in the list. That's a relief. Oh, well..."
,mgaroz,2012-09-19T22:29Z,"""i respect privacy""

Yet releases 50k usernames and passwords

Genius logic"
,CompleteGibberish,2012-09-20T05:09Z,"I call bullshit. Period. This smacks of someone getting demoted and pushed out,lashing back. You are about as middle eastern as William Shatner. How do you think RevTT will respond to this / They know who you are. They will dash and bash you and I seriously have no doubt they will cover their asses and then throw you to the wolves...Oh well, stupid is as stupid does.
Some humorous points
1 user name on here 7 times
This data is pre-migration, if you did not change your PW after migration...your fault :)
The poster has better grammar than most English speaking Americans"
,sl0beck,2012-09-20T05:35Z,You did this why again? Butthurt because you had a .2 ratio and got banned?  I cant wait to check the staff forum tomorrow and find out how much of a fail this actually is.
,brown_turd,2012-09-20T06:09Z,"Yo Afghanis, this turd here demands to know your favorite food?!?  If you don't answer within 48hrs I'm gonna make you a meal you will never forget..  The Poo Poo platter!!"
,timmmay82,2012-09-20T06:43Z,"I want to inform everybody that ""Afghanis"" is a sole, disgruntled admin of the RevTT community that didn't like how things were going. The responsible staff of the community has shut the site down indefinately for security reasons until a system can be devised to re-invite the users back.

Simply put, Afghanis isn't a hacker, and he isn't Afghan, he's just an asshole that can't get along.

Dude seriously needs to chill and toke up."
[V],scenebalance,2012-09-20T15:54Z,"Insider:

Revtt user info (like IP address emails and all downloaded files) will be shared with officials.
i know its bad news but that is the truth.

best of luck everyone."
,itsdoodoobaby,2012-09-20T18:13Z,"@ scenebalance

What are you talking about?  Links or didn't happen."
,brown_turd,2012-09-20T19:45Z,"So what if all that is shared?  The data is 3 years old!  'They' would want something a little more recent or ""hot"".  The info is like defunct.. too old.  They want like the steamy glistening turd, not the old white crusty turd that's been sitting in the sun for years.     .:. turd pride .:."
,timmmay82,2012-09-21T22:36Z,"shared with ""officials""?

your posting a comment on TPB and you act like ""officials"" don't already have more info on you than they can get from a private secure tracker and HTTPS/SSL community?

GTFO"
[T],FatFreddy379,2012-09-22T03:01Z,"Well this is a fail, guess these asshats are not that good, didn't get my password, try harder next time camel-turd fucktards"
,brown_turd,2012-09-23T02:39Z,Times up!!!  /me serves Afghanis the poo-poo platter!
,mgwump200,2012-09-29T23:49Z,Fuck what a sad butthurt twat - Afghanis my arse..
