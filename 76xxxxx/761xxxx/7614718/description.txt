Description from nerdcorps.com:

Slugterra is an epic sci-fi comedy adventure set deep underground, where the ammo's alive and only the quick survive! In this luminous, high-tech, underground world every cavern holds a new adventure, new battle and weird little slugs to be discovered!

The story follows Eli and his crew as they explore the caverns, challenge rivals and each other to friendly duels, upgrade their cool gear, and generally have a blast in this never-before-imagined underground world! But there is a very real threat to the world and the slugs; Dr. Blakk is seeking to "ghoul" the slugs, transforming them into feral mindless weapons! No one has been able to stand up to Blakk's powerful slugs and army of henchmenΓÇª until now.

There is a lot of conflicting info on the name of the show. "SlugTerra", "Slug Terra", even "Slugterrainea" (on tvrage). The graphic makes it seem that "SlugTerra" might be correct, but I believe that the correct name is actually "Slugterra", since that is how it is named on the nerdcorps.com website and also in the closed captions.
