,dollymadison123,2012-09-09T02:28Z,What's the deal with this one?  Just like UltraTorrents last copy?  Or does this have an English Audio track?
,BlaTaN,2012-09-09T02:55Z,If someone could post A/V  and let us all know if this is in ENGLISH  or some foreign alien sub-species language it would be much appreciated.

V-10
A- sounds good but off sync"

A-8? Sounds like a really good Cam Audio (just judging by the background noise) but is good. Unfortunately, it starts off a fraction oos and gets a bit worse as film progresses.  So, how would you rate that?"

A - 2

Good Video source but audio is out of sync and get worse through the file length.

Thanks for the up, awaiting a new one with in sync audio (In English). 

The EPID upload of 2GB only has Russian and French Audio. "

,dollymadison123,2012-09-09T06:20Z,"Just finished watching the whole thing and even though it goes out of sync by about 2-3 seconds for a period, it goes back in sync for a very short time and then gradually back out again.  Overall it is watchable though.  Just don't watch their mouths when they're talking.  Oh.. and it does get a bit choppy here and there as well.... The Audio, not the Video.  But Thanks for the UL UltraTorrents.  If I had Vegas, I'd probably have tried to sync it, but that computer crashed"
