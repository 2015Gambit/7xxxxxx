From battlestations.info:

Battlestations is a pulp sci fi adventure boardgame. Ongoing adventures feature simultaneous ship-to-ship and boarding combat in space. Players work together as a starship crew aboard a ship of their own design facing referee-controlled forces. YouΓÇÖll track the heroes' positions on the starship layouts and the starshipsΓÇÖ positions on the space map. The action in Battlestations is character driven. If you want the ship to turn, speed up, or launch a missile or blast the enemy ship, a hero has to take an action to make it so.

This is a scan of the manual, OCR'd and with a deep Table of Contents for your pleasure. If the designers ever officially release the PDF version of this manual (their site has said "coming soon" for the PDF manual for well over a year now) I recommend folks buy their PDF.

Buy the box set if you enjoy this game!

I've also included a set of all of what you'll need to play in PNG format, with transparency and all that; plus a MapTool campaign file and other resources if you want to play Battlestations in MapTool. (See rptools.net for details on MapTool.)
