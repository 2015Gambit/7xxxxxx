File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files!

Do it like this guy..

,wynterbourne,2012-09-08T22:30Z,Why would they do it like someone else? Some people like the x264 format and have absolutely no need to run to run it through a dvd/bluray/ps3. 
,morriso4,2012-09-08T22:33Z,Off topic: Can we also expect a torrent for the new episode of The Thick of It? This is the first time I'm watching the show weekly.
,imdbpaster,2012-09-08T22:34Z,"An unmanned spaceship hurtles towards certain destruction - unless the Doctor can save it, and its impossible cargo... of dinosaurs!

By his side a ragtag gang of adventurers, a big game hunter, an Egyptian Queen and a surprised member of the Pond family. But little does the Doctor know there is someone else on board who will stop at nothing to keep hold of his precious, prehistoric cargo."
