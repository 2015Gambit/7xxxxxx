[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-09-08T07:54Z,tv team-hardly a fake is it
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-09-08T10:29Z,"Always check the uploaders other torrents-by clicking on the uploader where it says 
BY: -TV Team
This is a no brainer as tv team is one of the biggest uploaders to TPB,they have over 30 pages of active torrents,They are a VIP account holder with a green skull which indicates they are a VIP & highly trusted-general rule is a skulled user can be trusted as they dont hand them out overnight,it has to be earnt by good work."
