Told from a Christian perspective, this DVD debunks a lot of the mormon theology.  This is a dvd disc I was handed by an anti-mormon activist in Salt Lake City today.  Kind of cheesy, and certainly told from a we-love-Jesus point of view, still has some good info on the weird church that mitt romney belongs to.
