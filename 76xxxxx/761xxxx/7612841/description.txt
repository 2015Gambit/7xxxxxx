The ANTs take the IQ test; Olive is devastated when Chyna scores higher. Olive retests to receive a higher score, but she doesn't do so well. Olive decides to dumb herself down and starts acting like a dumb blonde. The next day, she has transformed into a mini Paisley, acting just as clueless as her. Meanwhile, since Chyna got the highest IQ score in the entire school, Principal Skidmore chose her to represent Webster High in the Acadecathalon. Chyna is completely lost, so Olive steps in and takes her place. It is revealed that Angus messed with the IQ scores to lower Olive's self-esteem to finally go out with her. Elsewhere, hoping to be excused from P.E., Lexi and Cameron train to compete in curling in the Olympics with Gibson and Violet.
