Based on the old Quake engine, which won't trouble your PC too much, it's a very quick two episode 3D puzzle platform game. For anyone used to FPS games, the control will come naturally, but the game introduces the control system gradually through helpfully placed signs in the environment. It's really well done, and doesn't feel stupid.

This is a freeware game, so if this torrent is dead, just google it. Freeware DL doesn't come with Xpadder though. 

Xpadder, with Xbox360 & PS3 profiles included.

Just thought it was a neat little game to share, enjoy.
