I downloaded this and compared it to the 720P version that was uploaded in April of 2011, which was called a BRrip but had to be an HDTV rip.  Visually they're 100% identical to my eyes in both color and quality, at a fraction of the file size.  So unless you're an audiophile that needs the DTS audio rather than 5.1 channel AC3, you're better off downloading that version and saving yourself a lot of time and space. "
