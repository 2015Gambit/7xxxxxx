The fact you couldn't see how stupid that was is what allows your pea brain to call this a ""Triumphant Return""

My last shit was more epic than this complete tard of a movie.

SPOILER: THIS MOVIE SUCKS SO BAD THAT YOU KNOW FOR A FACT ANYONE THAT LIKED IT IS RETARDED."

Strange. I though it started with am Alien seeding the Earth with his broken-down DNA, mak releasing the amino acids to start off life here. then it skipped to archeologists on Earth (in scotland) who find a cave and paintings....they didn't dissapear did they?

What movie were you watching?"
,Gargrevar001,2012-09-10T17:40Z,"Actually, to clarify, the thing with the red balls mapping caves is just a modern twist on tech that already exists, laser mapping, but of course more futuristic given the time-frame, the ones they have can propel themselves. Two guys did not disappear, they were killed by a newly formed alien evolved from the worms. My point is this was over 30 minutes into the film, not at the start as you stated. That is what I meant by 'what film were you watching', unless the first half-hour of yours was missing."
