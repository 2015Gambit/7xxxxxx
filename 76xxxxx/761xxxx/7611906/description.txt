Overview: Total Recall | a Call Recorder


Total Recall is by far the most Popular Call Recorder on the Planet and has been since 2004. It's the ONLY Call Recording App that's been been used by literally MILLIONS of users across multiple OS's in every country across the globe, and the only Cross Platform Compatible Call Recorder that can record calls on not only Android, but also Nokia Nokia Symbian, Symbian^3 & Meego smart phones.

Sure there's cheaper Call Recorders out there, but they lack the FEATURES, FREQUENT UPDATES & SUPPORT that we have to offer. Ad-Based apps kill your batter in hours & run up expensive data charges. Plus, Total Recall is one of the few Call Recorders that actually records from the LINE not the MIC (on compatible devices).
