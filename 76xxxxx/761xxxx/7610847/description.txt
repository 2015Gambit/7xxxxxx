Rookie Blue is a new generationΓÇÖs cop show, served straight up with a twist of danger, sex and high-stakes drama. It's a series that candidly reveals the world of those who walk the thin blue line. 

We follow five officers from their first day on the streetsΓÇöas they're plunged into the world of big-city policing, where even the smallest mistake can have life-or-death consequences.

The heart of this close-knit group is 26-year-old Andy McNally. Andy's dad was a cop. Not the best cop maybeΓÇöhe retired under a cloud, though Andy has yet to find out why. And not the best dadΓÇölately she's been spending a lot of time picking him up off the floor, and taking the Scotch bottle out of his hands. Still, all she ever wanted to be is a cop. 

Andy's a born rescuer, but she joined the force not just to help people but to discover a sense of family she's never had. And sheΓÇÖs definitely found it among her fellow traineesΓÇöa group of young, ambitious twenty-somethings, carrying big guns and even bigger emotional baggage.

These five rookies trained at the Academy togetherΓÇöthey learned the rules togetherΓÇöthey fought, drank and slept together. Now theyΓÇÖre walking the beat together, learning the toughest kind of policing there is. They're the first responders. First on the scene, never knowing what dangers they're about to face. They're the officers walking into dark doorways without knowing whatΓÇÖs behind them. The police who get shot during routine traffic stops. The cops who never know whether their shiftΓÇÖs going to bring them a dead body, a violent home invasion, a john sweep, or a drug raid.

TheyΓÇÖre making mistakes, theyΓÇÖre trying to get ahead, theyΓÇÖre trying to watch each otherΓÇÖs backs while proving they can do this on their own. TheyΓÇÖre falling in love. Dealing with messy stuff at home. Learning to trust their instinctsΓÇösince they don't have experience to fall back on.

And theyΓÇÖre doing all this as they learn first-hand the hardest kind of policing there is.

Rookie Blue is a drama about the trials and triumphs, competition and camaraderie of this rookie family, who are about to learn the hard way that no amount of training can prepare them for the jobΓÇªor for life.
