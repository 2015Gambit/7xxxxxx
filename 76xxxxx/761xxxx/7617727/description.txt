During the last decade, Menomena has become its own reference point. From hooks wrapped around plummeting baritone saxophone lines and nearly inhuman rhythms to serpentine lyrical frameworks and high-concept album art, Menomena has established a singular and unmistakable aesthetic. No one else sounds quite like this band. They embed magic and mystery within pop songs that have never sat still or taken the path of least pressure. Their new album, Moms, is tragic and intimate, comic and endearing, personal and motivated. In 10 songs and just less than 50 minutes, Menomena cast pop cascades into noise kaleidoscopes (Baton), chop and twist a melody until it becomes a big dance beat (Capsule), and build inescapable arrays of tension and texture that finally release (Tantalus). Opener Plumage couples its surge of energy with a cleverly playful study of sexuality, while Pique turns the same sort of seemingly impossible tessellated-rhythm tricks that have become a Menomena trademark.
