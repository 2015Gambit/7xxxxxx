Notes: Ok where too start lol ...first off the cam itself wasn't too bad quality
wise HOWEVER the movement was out of this world ...up,down,side to side ,slant
left slant right.The video was also pretty dark,but pretty sure the film is meant
to be that way..
Also the fps was 50 so that means it was cammed with a PAL HD CAM ,yet the res
was really low considering and even more so once the crop was done.
Audio was clear and decent cam but it was too loud and overpowering imho.

Work done,too much and never again !!!
First took the video and cut into 44 pieces due to different movements,from there
it was a case of rotating the video to get the borders level,then crop,resize and
then filter the video with the brightness,contrast etc....
Did this to all 44 pieces and took ages ffs .....
Now the video had too much movement to get it levelled up so opted to level the
borders and crop so there is an angle to the video and that changes due to the
movement.
Also there is still borders that come and go because the movement was pretty
constant throughout so did the best i could without losing too much video :)
Also the AR will change due to different amounts cropped ....but needed one res
so i could append th files.Opted for a res that was better suited for most of the
video.

Audio stripped cleaned in AA lowering the DB's aswell as changing the EQ bands
before resaving to mp3 44100 128. Then i needed to resync it back to my encode.

Overall if it wasn't for the movement it would be a very nice cam and of course
hats off to the guy that risked doing it :)

Enjoy folks.
