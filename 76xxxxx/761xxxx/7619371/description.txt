for use the VL key will require you to find a working KMS-server(non online at this point) and using the retail keys will require you to activate windows later using an OEM-loader if one becomes available.

(seemes unlikely at this time given the improved security of the OEM activation process).



For good measure here is the default keys allowing you to install this as both core and pro as well as retail and VL
