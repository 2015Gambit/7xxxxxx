,P_W_W,2012-09-07T18:32Z,"NO SEEDERS on 18:30 while torrent info on this page states 55 (!) seeders less then one hour earlier. All hit and run or fake torrent?
Somebody inform us please!"
,mass55th,2012-09-07T18:56Z,Thank you!!
,P_W_W,2012-09-07T19:08Z,Torrent is hosted by other trackers and turns out to be well seeded.
,thewaymouth,2012-09-07T19:09Z,"This looks like a fraud -- it is s05e08 -- I have not downloaded it fully, but I say this is a fraud based on the opening ""previously on Damages..."" starts exactly the same as it did last week. That does not seem likely even in ""previously..."" that the show would start the exact same way 2 weeks in a row. "
,thewaymouth,2012-09-07T19:11Z,s05e08 this is
,thewaymouth,2012-09-07T19:18Z,"So I bailed. Unless someone who has seeded this completely can confirm this is not a fake, but again to me seems highly unlikely."
,kyriacou_a,2012-09-07T19:33Z,"It is S05E09!
Thanks a lot mdprosser!"
,mnjauau,2012-09-07T19:33Z,"You know what? You're lazy as....es! It is S5 E9, but you just couldn't watch it, before posting a comment! Forks fin, good torrent!"
,P_W_W,2012-09-07T19:45Z,"Tis is certainly NOT S05E08! I compaired them a few times and it is not the same episode!
Seems a new ep to me!"
,Pi.Rat,2012-09-07T22:16Z,"Yes, this is episode 9 of season 5. Thank you much to the uploader! It's become difficult to find torrents for new episodes.

V: 9/10
