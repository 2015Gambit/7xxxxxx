Season 3

Following an emotionally charged second season, Bravo's docu-series Work Out starts its anticipated third season on Tuesday, April 15 at 11:00 PM ET/PT, catching up with fitness maverick Jackie Warner as she prepares to tackle her personal relationships and business endeavors with a newfound maturity. The third season introduces the four skilled trainers Warner recently hired at her exclusive Beverly Hills gym Sky Sport & Spa, and her new live-in love, Brianna.

Last season Warner was reeling from a breakup with her toxic girlfriend, Mimi, and the unexpected death of one of her beloved trainers, Doug Blasdell. She also came to terms with her father's suicide and made strides in reconciling with her conservative mother, who does not approve of Warner's lifestyle. All the while she was juggling the increasing demands of her business and building her new Skylab venture, a high-end spa/fitness experience for overweight clients who want to change their minds, bodies and overall health. This season the series follows Warner as she takes on even bigger challenges with Skylab and continues to build Sky Sport & Spa with her new team of trainers.
