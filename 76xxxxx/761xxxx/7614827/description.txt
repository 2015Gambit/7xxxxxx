Gary Numan & Tubeway Army - Are Friends Electric [Szene, 1979].VOB


HQ very rare promo music video from a promo DVD. "Are 'Friends' Electric?" is a song by English new wave band Tubeway Army from their 1979 album Replicas. It was released as a single in May 1979 and reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for four weeks. It was written by Gary Numan.

Despite being over five minutes long and possessing, in the words of its composer, "no recognisable hook-line whatsoever", the single topped the UK charts. Whilst the track's distinctive sound stood out at the time, sales also benefited from the record company's use of a picture disc and Numan's striking, "robotic" performance on the TV shows The Old Grey Whistle Test and Top of the Pops. "Are 'Friends' Electric?" has been a mainstay of Numan's concerts since its release and appears on all ten of his official live recordings to date. A semi-acoustic version appeared on the 2006 Jagged tour setlist.

Gary Numan (born Gary Anthony James Webb on 8 March 1958) is an English singer, composer, and musician, most widely known for his chart-topping 1979 hits "Are 'Friends' Electric?" (as Tubeway Army) and "Cars". His signature sound consisted of heavy synthesiser hooks fed through guitar effects pedals.

Numan is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music. His use of themes from science fiction, and his combination of aggressive punk energy with electronics, have been widely imitated.

Scene was a youth magazine on First German Television, which by 1972 produced and presented each year with the corresponding date (such as ' scene ' 73').

Thomas Gottschalk hosted the scene, which was on Friday afternoon, from 1976 to 1979. Under him, the program developed into a pure music show with Studio performances from bands and supplemented by interviews, as on 16 July 1976 with Kiss and the first video clips, like "I Do not Like Mondays" by The Boomtown Rats. Sidekick Anthony Powell, was at his side in 1977 with slapstick comedy. The last episode ran on 16 November 1979. In 1980, the show returned as Pop-Stop and continued until 1983.
