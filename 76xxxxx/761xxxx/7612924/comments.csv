[V],thetorrentlord,2012-09-08T21:45Z,@r0ssxx :  There is no other post here at TPB other than (Damages S05E09 720p HDTV x264-i3i the small 600MB) posted a couple of hours ago and as it clearly states this  has been remuxed so it will not be the exact same file that you claim it to be. That is why it is labeled as such.
