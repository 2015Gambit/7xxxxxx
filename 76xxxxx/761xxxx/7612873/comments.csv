Go here for the watchable Overtime show:

I looked at the Lonefunman Overtime and I  noticed a couple things about this video that may cause you some problems. It has a packed bitstream. Some stand alone players can't handle a packed bitstream. The other thing is this video has an odd size. This video is 704x384. Most Xvid videos are usually made 640x360 or 624x352 to be compatible with most standalone DVD players

However I can confirm it plays fine on a windows XP computer using Windows media player 11 and Media Player Classic. (The computer has Xvid-1.3.2 installed) It also plays fine using VLC 1.1.11
Thank you Lonefunman for contributing to the Bill Maher scene

BTW: The other Overtime in the link you posted works great on VLC too."
