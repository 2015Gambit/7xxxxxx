This is a great film made over 60 years ago that cost the life of its director Paul Riche, a pseudonym of Jean Mamy, who was shot dead at the fortress of Montrouge on 29th March 1949 for what the Masonic courts termed; ΓÇ£Collaboration with the enemyΓÇ¥.  At the beginning of the film we see a young upright politician addressing the French parliament, he rips apart the blue pill Capitalist of the right and the red pill Communists on the left accusing them as being as deceitfully equal in their suppression of the ΓÇ£peopleΓÇ¥. 

His speech causes uproar among the Politicians, - and in a close-up sequence we can see two elder politicians discussing; ΓÇ£What ΓÇ£lodgeΓÇ¥ does he belong to?ΓÇ¥ - The other informs him; ΓÇ£HeΓÇÖs not one of usΓÇ¥.  ΓÇ£Ah no wonder heΓÇÖs so outspoken, I think he needs to be taken into the foldΓÇ¥.  ΓÇô The politician he has just told this to, then getΓÇÖs up from his row and goes three or four rows down and addresses a much elder chap; ΓÇ£Your Worshipful MasterΓÇ¥, and translates what his ΓÇ£brotherΓÇ¥ had just suggested.  The Worshipful Master raises the point thatΓÇÖs exactly what he was thinking and they decide to ΓÇ£initiateΓÇ¥ him into the world of Freemasonry as from then on.
