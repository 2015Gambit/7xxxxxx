This was one of my favourite shows when I was a kid.  Vincent Price (who did the show for FREE!!!) was the "guide" through the castle.  Visits to Dr. Pet Vet, music of the time spun by The Wolfman, crazy cooking tips from Grizellda...and a science class with a real science professor (who studied under Einstein) always kick-started my Saturday morning cartoon ritual.

Until recently, I didn't know that there was an American release of this DVD.  According to Amazon.com reviews, it has been "bastardized" from the Canadian version: the American release has the show cut into 30-minute episodes, and has inserted a children's laugh-track.  This version is the Canadian release: 45-minute episodes, and no laugh-track.

This will always be a timeless classic for me, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
