was not in the long run.



Offering a pretty decent retrospective of Motown that was
originally aired on Television.
I recorded this for my Mother during the 2 day run.

Heavily "gordycentric" leaving out many key players of
the bigger picture at motown.
Regardless, some classic clips and quotes.
it was all downhill after MOtown uprooted from the MotorCity.

Still, Motown LIVES ON!
