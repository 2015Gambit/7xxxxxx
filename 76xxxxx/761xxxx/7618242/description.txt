This is the edited version of the the Livestream recording of the T&B Live. Please keep in mind that the live feed suffered from a lot of buffering and dropped video. I have edited out all the buffering pauses and a large number of dropped frozen video. The curtain closing is all but gone along with the majority of Blue Rose's Go Next!! performance. Everything else though held up VERY well. I hope you all enjoy it!!! 

Please seed for the next person.
