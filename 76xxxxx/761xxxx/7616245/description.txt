"I always loved this show. The Jerry highlights in the first set 'Sugaree', 
'Birdsong' and 'Deal' are outstanding. Fantastic 'Wheel' intro out of space!  The audience in the upper mezzanine all joined hands for 'The Wheel' and danced all the way around the perimeter of venue inspired by the song - Great moment in audience improvisation with the band."
