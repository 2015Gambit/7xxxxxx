,steveastray,2012-09-10T03:56Z,"Appreciate this but why is it 10 gigs? your previous were much smaller and great quality,
No disrespect, just curios,
Thanks again"
,Postoasted,2012-09-10T05:15Z,Fast upload. Thanks
,monnica688,2012-09-10T06:40Z,Wow this file is huge. 10 gigs? Download is very very slow but thanks for making this available. 
[V],Nepotu,2012-09-10T08:03Z,"You are all welcome! The file is so big because it has 1080i resolution. My normally files had 540p. Maybe later, I'll find a smaller version."
,skigh,2012-09-10T10:48Z,"Ppl please seed, this massive ass download says 20 hours left :'("
,tensigh2,2012-09-10T15:01Z,"I don't want to be ungrateful, but 10 GB is ridiculous. By the time we can download it, game 2 will be done and overwith. 

Please, please consider making the files smaller. Since I'm watching them on an older computer, less resolution is better anyway. But unless someone wants to seed this with a super fast connection, there's no way we'll be able to see it.

Sorry, no one else is seeding the game, so I'm kind of screwed. "
[V],Nepotu,2012-09-10T15:28Z,I'll try to find a smaller option for you.
,tensigh2,2012-09-10T16:17Z,"Thank you!! I appreciate it so much! I'm stranded out here (overseas) without any US football! 

I would appreciate a smaller file - you really are DA MAN!!"
,leibei,2012-09-10T16:53Z,"Please anybody who has this, there doesn't seem to be any smaller release that is good too (wiggan88's release is missing 7 minutes, vaddon30's is Russian) can somebody just run this through an encoder and make this thing smaller in both bites and resolution?
If you can play a 1080i video it probably won't take long..."
,tensigh2,2012-09-10T17:28Z,"leibei, thanks for the leads! I don't care if it's in Russian or in Martian, as long as I can see the game! Who cares if it's missing 7 minutes? I can miss 7 minutes or I can miss the whole game by reading the score on line. At 10 GB, I won't see it until next month anyway. 

So thanks for the leads, I'm downloading it in Russian. That's better than a file that will complete in October! :)"
,Jbass23,2012-09-10T19:27Z,"tensigh2

Man, that is some shitty internet connection."
,tensigh2,2012-09-11T01:03Z,"Especially when you're trying to download a 10 GB file that no one is seeding! 

I was exaggerating. Look it up."
,wntrcmng,2012-09-11T16:19Z,"billswild00 is new capper...slowwwww!!!!

thanks for upload I will definately seed :)"
,wntrcmng,2012-09-11T16:27Z,"thanks for up, i was going nuts waiting for billswild00 on TYT

I will seed, feel free to request if anyone needs this "
,wntrcmng,2012-09-11T16:32Z,"1080i usually means raw cap
its good for archive or collectors"
,valenciagoman,2012-09-12T16:54Z,"For me 1080i raw quality is perfect!!
thak you very much!!!"
