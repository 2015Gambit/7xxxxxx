Problems in Physics by V. Zubov and V. Shalnov. 


    For the most part, this is a collection of modified problems
    discussed in extracurricular circles and at tutorials and
    olympiads at the Moscow University.
    In selecting and preparing the problems for this collection
    the authors attempted to focus the attention of the reader
    on those postulates and laws of physics where students make
    the most mistakes. Some problems were specially selected
    to explain comprehensively the application of the most
    important laws -something which students often fail to
    grasp properly. A number of problems concern the subjects
    usually omitted in secondary school text-book problems.
    Some problems are intended for discussion in extracurricular
    circles or for independent study by those wishing to
    acquaint themselves with material beyond the scope of the
    school syllabus.
    The most difficult problems and the problems outside
    the scope of the secondary school syllabus are provided
    with detailed explanations in order to give the student
    a better understanding of the general principles of solution.
    With this end in view, some sections are also supplemented
    with brief information about the most frequent mistakes
    and the simplest means of solution.

The book was translated from the Russian by A. N. Troitsky and the translation was edited by J. B. Williams. Mir Publishers published this book first time in 1974 with a second reprint in 1985. The link below is for the second print.

This will be a good material for those who are preparing for Olympiads and other competitive exams.
