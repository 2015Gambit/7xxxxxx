Dear down loaders! I share a few of my movies out of the collection... and I don't say ""Please SEED!"" 
As you know it's all up to you if the movie will be available for others! I will do an upload until it's 10 copies out there, and after that I drop the torrent. Sometimes I can do some more ""seeding"" after a request, but I have other things to do. 
If you really want to have the movie and nobody is willing to share it! Do as I do! Buy it from Amazon.com or Play.com. 
Pirate Bay is an option, not a video store.
This is the reality! Have a nice day!

So I humbly have a request, please seed James Bond Thunderball a little more. There seems to be no one with 100% of the torrent so maybe you can help out? Thank you."
