                           LINE OF SIGHT: VIETNAM 
Your job is to locate elusive enemy soldiers and pick them off one-by-one. Whether patiently waiting for the enemy to show himself or delivering a pre-emptive strike, the method is the same - be quick, be quiet, and be careful. That's what will get you home alive. Thick vegetation in fully detailed environments provide cover for you... or the enemy. Select the right weapon for the job from over 12 authentic firearms.
