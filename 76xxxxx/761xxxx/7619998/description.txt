Robot Chicken, DC Special (WEB-DL - 720p)
-----------------------------------------

The Robot Chicken DC Comics Special brings you the awesomeness of the DC Comics
universe of characters as only Robot Chicken can, with amazing guest stars and
the stop-motion sketch comedy you've come to love after five seasons of the
popular Adult Swim series. The special features many Robot Chicken favorites
including the Robot Chicken Nerd, the Humping Robot, Composite Santa, and
the Mad Scientist who will be joined by characters of the DC Comics universe
to poke fun at those with the most impressive powers and the lesser ones who
can't really be called superheroes.

Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, DC Entertainment and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.
