Just as Jake begins to destroy their new home, a handsome stranger named Ben (Victor Webster) knocks on her door, claiming Jake is his. A professional baseball player, Ben was traveling for a game when Jake ran away under the less-than-watchful eye of his friend Ryles (Jamison Jones) and wound up at a shelter.

Will BenΓÇÖs puppy play dates keep this proud bachelor on a short leash, or will he soon discover his best friend is leading him straight to love?
