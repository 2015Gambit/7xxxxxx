,lepsgnr,2012-09-09T00:43Z,"weird, says that have seeds but connected to none, and every one that i have connected has the same % of download."
,dontlikefake,2012-09-09T00:45Z,ZZZZZZZZ  all this waiting gets boring
,Revisionist,2012-09-09T00:47Z,"why even  bother with a 2 gig file when there is no 5.1.

And why do SD files get posted first.  Logically the HD file should come first and then the encoders can covert that for who ever wants these SD versions"
,Rob2042,2012-09-09T00:53Z,"Is this the same Russian one already out?  If so, is this just an attempt to trick us into downloading it?  I thought skulls could be trusted.  Guess I was wrong."
,JeffCC,2012-09-09T00:54Z,CAM Audio Version
,sumosmurf,2012-09-09T00:57Z,"@Revisionist: If it is a DVDRip as stated in the title, that would mean it came from an SD source. Hence there is no HD source. That's why the SD came first."
,bullerbase12,2012-09-09T00:58Z,FAAAAKEEE   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,magnakahn,2012-09-09T01:18Z,"Weird torrent, I wonÂ´t even bother..."

,syamani,2012-09-09T04:19Z,Audio is French. Dammit!! Video quality is great though.
,luvtpb123,2012-09-09T05:01Z,daaamnn... would of saved time and hatred if you just watched your own upload for a few minutes to confirm what language its in...:|
,tokerator,2012-09-09T05:18Z,"scenebalance, I am disappointed."
,fubarx79,2012-09-09T09:52Z,"A : 2 (french over russian)

V : 6

Watchable but the language should be mentioned in the description if not in the title. And the audio is anoying, even for people who understand french."
,GlennV,2012-09-09T11:14Z,"*Shakes Head* Perhaps you shouldn't just read the info but actually the whole page... You will clearly see the following:

Type:Video > MoviesFiles:1Size:2.06 GiB (2213582848 Bytes)Spoken language(s):French, Russian

From that information I gather it's not ""English"""
,hororcore,2012-09-09T13:22Z,Why even release this ??? 
,saintor,2012-09-09T13:43Z,"READ HERE IF YOU WANT ENGLISH SUBTITLE

step 1: Download this eng sub from here
https://regtransfers-sth-se.diino.com/download/promtheh/df/Prometheus.srt

Step 2: You must watch it using ""VLC Player""

Step 3: go to tools/synchronization
and change the subtitle synch to 159.000

Thanks and enjoy the movie. A tips, choose french audio its much better. "
,ervin808,2012-09-09T14:03Z,"A/V, 8/9, NOT BAD BUT IT'S IN FRENCH"
,epicfrog,2012-09-09T14:36Z,it's a waste of time to try and enjoy such a good movie with such low quality video and audio
,xhizors,2012-09-09T16:16Z,"This isn't a DVDRip, scenenbalance, you stupid fuck, it's a TS."
,SR4T9US,2012-09-10T03:08Z,"Who all thinks that TVTeam, Scenebalance, Scene4all are the same? I've always thought that it was a single uploader with multiple accounts. Maybe someone suffering from OCD or something?"
