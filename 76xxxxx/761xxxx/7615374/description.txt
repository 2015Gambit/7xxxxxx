AudioMulch is an interactive musicianΓÇÖs environment for PC and Mac. It is used for live electronic music performance, composition and sound design.

AudioMulch allows you to make music by patching together a range of sound producing and processing modules. Unlike some patcher-based programming environments, AudioMulchΓÇÖs modules perform high-level musical functions, so you donΓÇÖt have to create things from the ground up using individual oscillators and filters. AudioMulch is designed for live performance and improvisation ΓÇô you can process live audio sources and control every knob and slider on the user interface using a MIDI controller.
