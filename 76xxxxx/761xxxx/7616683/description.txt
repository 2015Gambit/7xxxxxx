Please join me on this quest of urban exploration through dark passages - yet there are rays of hope throughout as we seek paradise. First we must embark upon a gritty, dimly lit poetic journey through the dark hour, looking for the new dawn. Once we have found this new hope, we must stay true to the path and finish our quest. We ultimately find ourselves on a grim, fateful journey through the horrors of night, only to find tales of fantasy and hope at the end.
