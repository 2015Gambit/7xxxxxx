La Santé is a project of Andree Vdb, who lives in Sweden. In the nineties Adree co-founded DHM – one of Poland's most influential post punk / new wave bands. He was responsible for lyrics, vocals and bass guitar.

His inspirations span across bands like D.A.F., The Mission or Killing Joke. Those inspirations – to a various degree – can be heard in La Santé's music today.

La Santé is following the oldschool electronic style. The overall sound, however, is modern and created using latest studio techniques. This creates solid modern EBM music with vocals leaning towards dark/coldwave.
