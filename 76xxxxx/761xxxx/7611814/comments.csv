Reed Crandall illustrated Edgar Rice Burroughs, along with a mixed bag of pages by Steve Ditko, Jack Gaughan, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Ralph Reese, Roy G. Krenkel and Angelo Torres. The issue wrapped with Frank Frazetta's back cover portrait of Buster Crabbe.

The second issue displayed a front cover by Wood and a back cover by Reese. Gray Morrow's 'Orion', which began in this issue of witzend, was completed in Heavy Metal in 1979. Two pages of 'Hey, Look!' by Harvey Kurtzman were followed by 'a feeble fable' from Warren Sattler, 'If You Can't Join 'em... Beat 'em' and more ERB illustrations by Crandall and Frazetta. The center spread presented poems by Wood, Reese and Pearson. Following a Bill Elder cartoon, ""Midnight Special"" by Ditko and 'By the Fountain in the Park' by Don Martin, Wood offered another 'Animan' installment.

In the third issue, between a Wood front cover and a Williamson back cover, were Ditko's first ""Mr. A"" by Ditko, ""The Invaders"" by Richard Bassford, Wood's ""Pipsqueak Papers"", more ""Hey, Look!"" pages and ""Last Chance,"" a previously unpublished 1950s EC New Direction story, drawn by Frazetta and rewritten and edited by Bill Pearson. The issue also featured work by Roger Brand, Will Eisner, Richard 'Grass' Green and Art Spiegelman.

With witzend number four, Wood began a serialization of his epic fantasy, 'The World of the Wizard King'. These installments of illustrated prose fiction were co-authored with Pearson. Shifting from illustrated text to a comics format, Wood continued the storyline in his later graphic novel, published in two editions (one b&w, one color) - The Wizard King and The King of the World.

After the fourth issue, Wood sold witzend to Pearson 'for the sum of $1.00', and the Pearson-edited issues continued to explore new avenues with contributions from Vaughn Bode, Eisner, Jeff Jones, Wood, Bernie Wrightson and others.

Contributors included Wally Wood, Al Williamson, Reed Crandall, Steve Ditko, Jack Gaughan, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Ralph Reese, Roy G. Krenkel, Angelo Torres, Frank Frazetta, Gray Morrow, Warren Sattler, Bill Elder, Don Martin, Roger Brand, Will Eisner, Richard Bassford, Richard ""Grass"" Green, Art Spiegelman, Vaughn Bode, Jeff Jones, Bernie Wrightson"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-08T07:08Z,"Part of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader you should actually shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.

-------------------------------------------------------

After it was pointed out to me that people were getting a GonVisor popup, I am now creating these books in such a way as to have stopped that from happening. No GonVisor popup will appear on any 'Restorations' in the future.

------------------------------------------------------

I have almost 1500 Underground comic books in a digital format. I will be restoring and uploading many of my favorites over the coming months. Any requests, just say the word.

So what does 'Restored' mean? Well with all due respect to the great and wonderful Sir Real (if you know the name, you know his power!) and all the other scanners who have shared these books with the online world, the pages of these books were not yellow when first printed. Newsprint? Yes, often they were. Cheap paper? Yeah, that too. But not yellow.

In most cases, the changes make the books look better than they did when they were originally printed. By turning the newsprint or cheap paper they were printed on to a bright white, with crisp, clear greys and solid blacks on top, they look very much like a new b&w comic you would buy right off the shelf today.

This is accomplished by running the b&w pages through the PhotoScape Batch Editor. The Filters applied to the pages are; Grayscale (changes the image to greyscale); a 'Middle' of 'High' setting on Auto Level (greatly improves the blacks); a 'Low' or +1 Sharpen (barely noticeable, even if you watch the changes take place); 'Deepen' is used if there is bleed through from the image on the back of the page or to improve the overall look or color or b&w pages. Occasionally 'Brighten' or 'Darken' are used if needed. Color covers, back or interior pages are 'Restored' on a page by page basis.

And even though I'm not really into scanner tags, out of respect for the huge amount of work he's done (or did - who knows how one so mysterious works?!), if an original Sir Real front page existed I have moved it to the back of the book. "
,inkle,2012-09-08T11:52Z,"Dear LeonardTSpock,

loved all the comics that you are uploading, however, can i make a small little request? is it possible for the comics that you are uploading to include the option to download using the "".torrent"" extension?

as most of the time i do remote torrent download, either from the office or when i'm not sitting in front of the pc in my house, and with just the magnetic link, i'm unable to do it.

is there a reason to just having the magnetic link option for the torrents? if it's for security purposes, then i will understand."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-08T20:28Z,"Hey inkle. Glad you like the uploads.

Nope. The download choices have nothing to do with me, they're just the way TPB works these days. I think if you search around a bit in the forum you could probably find a way to keep doing your remote downloading."
,ajjibhai,2012-09-18T01:03Z,"Thanx for filling my request, man. U rock! seriously. unfortunately, my net has been sucking leeches of late, so downloading will take like forever.

Any chance of other Wood material showing up soon?

keep up the GREAT work!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-20T04:18Z,"You're most welcome ajjibhai. This one needed to be 'out there'. 

I started seeding this one again for you. Hopefully that will help.

Yeah, I'll do some more Wood stuff, for sure. I've got plenty more in the collection. Not exactly sure when, though."
