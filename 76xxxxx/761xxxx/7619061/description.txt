Teresa invites her longtime ally and sister of the enemy, Dina, to her Fabellini release party.
The ladies form new alliances after their return from the west coast. The Gorgas left Napa early to show their support of Teresa, but now Melissa hopes to calm the wake that Teresa left behind by asking Caroline to forgive her cantankerous sister-in-law. While Kathy goes to college for a day with her daughter Victoria, Caroline gets her crack at being an oracle on Sirius Radio. In the end, it's not just Teresa's new alcoholic beverage that's fizzing, when she invites her longtime ally and sister of the enemy, Dina, to her Fabellini release party.
