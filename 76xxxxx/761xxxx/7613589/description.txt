Hi again!
Here is one gift to all retro gamers there from the glorious days of our childhood.

Containing
The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall (1996) 	
An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire (1997) 	
The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard (1998) 	

Technically speaking, Redguard and Battlespire are not expansion packs for The Elder Scrolls 2 but are from two spin off series called Elder Scrolls Legend and The Elder Scrolls Adventures.But as they came after The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall and before The Elder Scrolls III : Morrowind, so I have treated them like expansions and have included here.Those two were the only spin offs for PC as far as I am aware.

An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire limited itself to dungeon-romping and The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard was a linear third-person action-adventure game.

Daggerfall and Battlespire will run in DOSBOX. The instruction manual is included in the zip files. (Daggerfall is difficult to install but follow the instructions closely).
I played Redguard on Windows 98 so please 
1. Find a windows 98 iso from somewhere(or you may still have your old cd, I don't.)
2.Use some visualization software like Oracle VM virtualbox (its free, just google and download) 
3. Install win 98 inside the virtualware
4. Mount Redguard CDs one by one (using Deamon Tools or Alcohol 120, Linux users try AcetonelISO) and install the game.

Like my every release, all the games will work fine in Linux. Tested in Fedora 14

Forget not to
1. say thanks
2. more importantly, seed after you finish downloading.
