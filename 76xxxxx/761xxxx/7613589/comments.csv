Battlespire on the other hand is the first game I remember buying and feeling like some one stole my money. (But here I am today, so I suppose everything balances out eventually.)

Thanks for sharing this. "

2.Use some virtualization* software like Oracle VM virtualbox (its free, just google and download) 

@ bakaonna, thanks for the suggestion. Will keep in mind. "
,Daggerfallowns,2012-09-16T19:52Z,"When creating a character in Battlespire, Dosbox crashes every single time I click ""equipment"". What can I do about this?"
,Daggerfallowns,2012-09-17T05:42Z,I must cleanse the Battlespire! It crashes at character creation. Standing by; please advise!
,tpbcrazy,2012-09-18T21:06Z,"@ Daggerfallowns,try running it in win 98. Let me know of the results."
,Daggerfallowns,2012-09-20T23:20Z,"@tpbcrazy Do you mean get like a virtual windows program and a copy of windows 98, or partition the HD? I've never messed with either. I also tried to skip the equipment option in character creation, and it let me, then I ran to the nearest weapons and it crashed when I tried to equip them."
,tpbcrazy,2012-09-22T06:38Z,"@ Daggerfallowns, I never encountered this problem mate, I am not really sure what is happening. 
Anyway, what I meant is, instead of running with DOSBOX, run it in Windows 98. You can install 98 in a partition or you can use virtualbox and install 98 inside that. Hope you ll find a way. Google is always there too :)"
