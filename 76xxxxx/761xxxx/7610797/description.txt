Syndee and Sierra grabbed some football gear Billy had left around the house and Sierra dared Syndee to try on his should pads just to play a little dress up. Billy caught them red handed and was pretty upset since he had told Sierra many times before not to goof around with his equipment. Syndee and Sierra knew just how to calm him down by letting him join in the fun. Share and share alike is the rule of the land in Round And Brown town this week. They both took turns getting their round, brown mounds pounded by Billy.
