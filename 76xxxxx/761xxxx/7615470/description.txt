This torrent contains 3 Indian Pop Albums released by(which is banned by most ISP's in India).

1. Heroine. (Movie)
2. Thousand Thoughts - Bohemia. (Pop/Rap)
3. RD Burman Reinvented - DJ Suketu. (Remix)

The changes made to the files are as follows:

1. Those who already have some music downloaded fromare already aware the File names and Titles of their songs include the prefix & postfixwhich I personally find annoying as I perfer cleaner names. Hence, all the file names have been cleaned ofhowever, I still thank them for being such a great source.

2. The Album art is still the same as no good source available for that.

Note: These files are of 256-320 Bitrate.

Finally, if you liked the music and would love to hear it in all clarity, please support the artists by purchasing their work as MP3 is still crappy (IMO).

Enjoy, Cheers!!!
