 I know my account is new, but I am actually a scener myself, but I am very heavily involved in the FXP scene.

 I am not normally one who torrents, but I got a copy and felt like sharing, cuz that is the spirit of the scene."

Look here:  -->  https://thepiratebay.se/search/Prometheus*/0/99/200"
,DelMinor,2012-09-10T10:25Z,"Well, if you like, you can remove it. I was just trying to help by offering another source.

 Anyway, take care my friend."
