This is Assimil's "Spanish with Ease(1987)" pdf - English.



PLEASE READ NOTE #1 BELOW:

1.I'm not the original uploader of this pdf, so THE FIRST 18 LESSONS WERE NOT INCLUDED SO I ADDED THEM FROM THE FRENCH VERSION. THE REST OF THE LESSONS, 19-109, ARE ENGLISH -- TRASLATION THAT IS.

OPINION:

2. The audio for this course is quite horrendous: slow throughout, actors/voices are poetic, and the dialogs don't link (sometimes within themselves). Better off using "Spanish Without Toil" (b/w pdf & audio available online) or L'espagnol sans peine (new version -- more lively).



SEED AND ENJOY!
