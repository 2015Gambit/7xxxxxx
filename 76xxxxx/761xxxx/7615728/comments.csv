,vashterbation,2012-09-09T15:41Z,"@Daman, I'm curious why your torrents lately have been 1080p?
I've noticed you don't use FLAC audio because it inflates the file size but recently you've switched to 1080p which inflates file size for very minor if not unnoticeable video difference. pls continue to upload in 720x1280 (unless you have your reasons why)

aside from that im just another bloke who made this acc just to say thanks. you small file, high quality torrents are excellent!"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-09T15:51Z,"i only do 1080p on animes i like, I didnt use flac because the source is only 2.0 instead of 5.1.

the significant difference between 720p and 1080p is mostly color. in 720p you lose around 10-15% of the natural color from 1080p not really a big difference but since i like this anime i went for 1080p"
,vashterbation,2012-09-09T17:53Z,"@Daman, yeah makes sense, it is your hard work going into these so why not go the better quality for a fav anime.

You do a lot of funi's anime (which I like since everything not funi is easily obtainable elsewhere) but any chance on a Needless upload at any point?"
,Daww,2012-09-12T08:05Z,"I also dig the Funimation uploads, So far I've downloaded most of the anime series you've uploaded ^_^ so thank you for the effort you work on these!"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-09-13T12:41Z,"If you see me comment; you know that the Anime series in particular is of high quality. Thanks, Daman!

To everyone else, this is entirely worth the quality.

Is there more episodes to be released soon, Daman?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-14T01:34Z,No date is scheduled for Collection Part 2.
,Lost_Leaf,2012-09-14T17:19Z,"Cheers, Daman.

Every aspect of this series is 10/10 for those who are doubtful. Daman is renowned for giving you the best quality at the lowest possible file size. 

Also, it seems they're finally releasing the second part of Fate/Zero on Blu-Ray, sweet!

,Lost_Leaf,2012-09-25T17:05Z,"Daman, will you be uploading Steins;Gate soon by any chance?

It just released today in English dub: episodes 1-12. Very good anime, that's well worth the watch if you haven't seen it yet."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-25T20:29Z,"yes, i will uploading steins gate as soon as i get my hands on the DVds/blu rays"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-25T20:30Z,"Victor, to Re-encode them back to 8bit use Handbrake, and use M4v plays fine in the ps3 "
