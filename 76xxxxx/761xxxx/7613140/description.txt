When a domesticated grizzly named Boog gets lured into leaving the creature comforts of home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliot, he finds himself lost in the woods just three days before hunting season. Forced to ?rough it? in the great outdoors, Boog goes native, rallying all the forest animals to take back their home and send the hunters packing.
