This loader will fix the start up crash "AVA_Main has stopped working" that occurs after installing Skidrow's update 4 and without update 4 you will not be able to play Coldstrike Campaign and Reinforcement Pack DLC, so i made this little loader and it works perfectly for me & should work for you too.

Instructions:
*install the game.
*install skidrow's update 4.
*install Coldstrike Campaign and Reinforcement Pack DLC "Optional".
*copy this loader to game's directory and apply it, it will take some time to find code to modify, this will happen only once.
*from now on play the game using this loader.

this is a DUP 2 loader without any additional pack/crypt so any AV alert should be false.
