What is it?
It's a free digital acoustic blues album. 13 tracks, all acoustic, only some of them having a touch of drums and/or bass. Gritty delta blues with screaming slide guitar, beautiful ballads, uptempo fun. We've tried to incorporate multiple styles into this album.

Can I buy this CD?
Are you having trouble reading? It's a DIGITAL album, meaning it's only available as a download. Sure, CD's are digital too, but the packaging and the CD itself are still very much not.

It's released under a Creative Commons license. If you want to burn it on a cd, go ahead. If you want to print out every single bit and swim naked in it. Go right ahead. Take pictures if you're a girl.

Who are The Damned and Dirty?
Guitarist Micha Sprenger and vocalist/harmonicist Kevin de Harde. The Damned and Dirty are not touring at the moment, but you can check them out in their band BluesMotel.

Fellow BluesMotel bandmember Frank van Tijn contributed drums to a couple of tracks. The recording was done on August 1st and 2nd 2012 by Erwin Palper and Frank de Jong at 20Twelve Audio. Photos are by Bas Stoffelsen.

Why free?
The decision to release it under a permissive Creative Commons license was an easy one. Micha Sprenger: ΓÇ£With the release of our BluesMotel albums we noticed the many opportunities the internet brings to music. As a musician you want as many people to just hear your music. The ΓÇÿillegalΓÇÖ distribution of our previous albums helped us to get notice and airplay from around the world. Blues is not as mainstream as weΓÇÖd like. From this perspective we can only encourage more free distribution.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£Current copyright laws are too restrictive and outdated,ΓÇ¥ Kevin adds, ΓÇ£Creative Commons is a modern way to deal with copyright and encourages creativity and sharing. We want to make it easier for people to cover our songs or use them as a soundtrack for a movie.ΓÇ¥
