We're a very small team who dumped 3 years of our lives and a lot of money into making this game, and it has not been selling quite as well as we were hoping for. We really need the sales if you want us to continue making games, and we want to continue making games, so if you enjoy it please feel free to support the game and spread the word and stuff. www.closuregame.com"

,Tsusaku,2012-09-26T12:08Z,"Hi Tyler

I will probably not buy this game, as its not one i usually play (i am an RPG guy), not to mention i am now long time in no money (literally) situation, but i like to make a video to show it to some of my friends. Theres not many but i am sure some of them will like the game and buy it then. 
I always put in an info about where to get the original game etc. I do it mostly because if i like the concept, even thou i dont want to play the game through, i think it need to be seen, so i show it."
