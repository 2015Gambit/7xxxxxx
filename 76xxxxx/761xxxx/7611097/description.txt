"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one"
'"The House of the Rising Sun" has been recorded by many artists.
Among others: The Animals, Bob Dylan and Dolly Parton.
And like many classic folk ballads, the authorship of "The House of the Rising Sun" is uncertain.
Now it is time for you to enjoy this VERY special solo video of Jessie to a very special song. I really don't have any more words to describe it. I'll let the video speak for itself. You can make your owninterpretation of the lyrics, or sit back and enjoy ours.
I think you'll love it, we think it's really cool!
Oh and P.S. It is obviously totally hot when the song ends, Jessie gets in the bed and masturbates until she cums - they do say it's steamy down there in New Orleans! See for yourself
