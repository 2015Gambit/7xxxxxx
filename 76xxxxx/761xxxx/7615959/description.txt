NFO :

this independently released "highDefinition" Cd HDCD was produced for a theatre play in 2001. 
It sounds like a labor of love. It's a compilation of 2 very talented people, and of course a cast of 
Many other talented folks. The topic is the resonate life behind  the 3rd dimension. It's a predominant 
master class musical affair as Alan Jones is a very talented Drummer coming from the jazz swing funk bop
side of the spectrum, and a healthy dose of experimentation. He's in the pocket and then swinging like
it's no-ting  . The music structure does the topic very well, being very weird at times, going ambient 
to full bodied and interweaving different time signatures for the spritual gumbo being offered up.
I don't know how this was originally distro'd because I found this only a few weeks ago at a thrift store
on the pacific west coast of Canada, and it appears it's from Portland Oregon. It appears this was reissued
just with Alan Jones as the title credit and different package/graphics. 
The recording is awesome. They use the seldom used HDCD algorhythm..(which honestly I have to find out more
about) but due to the initial signal chain (which they discuss a bit in the liner notes) they used care to use really
nice analogue gear. It looks like the only digital aspect was the mix down to the HDCD. There is real hammond
organ, real horns, real drums. :D And the drums are mic'd in a very tasty method, not too future, a bit grit but 
very clear. I figure this needs more exposure, especially for those that like spiritual jazz music.
