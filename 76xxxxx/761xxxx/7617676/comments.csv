just to be asking you.. might sound a little strange though.. is there any way you can colorize a black n white movie in a 720p.. i knw this sounds funny.. but just asking.. if u can do it.. then i do have some recommendations.."
,eroticburps,2012-09-11T09:10Z,"Thanks pal.. do u have a fan page.. like facebook or smthing. wud like 2 join u der..

im a fan of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's. i really wish they colorize all of his works. industry really needs ppl like Ingrid Bergman and Orson Welles today.

hey mate.. i am crazy about B grade horror movies too. do ya like Friday the 13th series.. it wud really be fun watchng the series in a 720p mate.."
