,kside,2012-09-17T04:39Z,"Video           : 720x400 (16:9), Progressive, 25.000 fps, XviD, ~1282 Kbps, 0.178 bits/pixel
Audio           : 48.0 KHz, AC3, 6 ch, 448 Kbps

That means that AR (Aspect Ratio) is WRONG! and image is comressed horizontally (long faces). Correct AR is 2.35:1 = 720x304

Otherwise is OK, but as the BluRay already exists, you already have better options.
