,molitar,2012-09-12T00:18Z,I ran the crack but I did not see anything change it still shows all as unused and the one I did trial shows a cutoff date for the trial.  What is it suppose to do?
,molitar,2012-09-12T01:33Z,DOES NOT WORK!  I installed and tested.. changed the date to a month ahead and now it's expired and I can not use the feature anymore.  This CRACK IS GARBAGE!  DOES NOT WORK!  Windows 7 32bit.  
[V],ChattChitto,2012-09-12T02:45Z,"@molitar
It does work, stop being a troll :)"
,jammerking,2012-09-12T14:40Z,"Thank you works great.  Installed on Win 7 ultimate.  
As mentioned before be sure to remove registry entries for DVDFab for prior installs

1. ran setup  did not restart computer
2. used auto crack 1 x64
3. restarted computer and disabled internet connection.
4. Started DVDFab 8 Qt clicked on popup check for new version then Start DVDFab
5.Common settings-> General - UN-CHECKED check for new version automatically and saved.
6. enabled internet connection.

,JetsetJoey,2012-09-12T21:48Z,"I've never had a issue with Mr. Chitto's DVDFab... UNTIL today!!! I installed the program & also the replaced the .dll file into the proper directory.

HOWEVER, when I restarted the program it now says ""Trial User"" & under ""Update Expire Time"" it says 2012-Oct-08.

I even COMPLETELY uninstalled the previous version with REVO Uninstaller Pro & tried a fresh reinstall... but still no luck!

Noteworthy is @ the top of the window after DVDfab 8.2.1.0 it says (07/09/2012) which is one month before the expiration date.

Any ideas anyone?!?!?!

,sfx34110,2012-09-14T04:57Z,"All these series of dvdfab crack using msvcr90.dll DOES NOT WORK. 

Dvdfab intentionally made it work on certain computers, and you thought you have cracked it. But it does not work on other computers. Will show trial user and expire.

The last working version from ChattChitto was v8.1.7.8, where the crack was DvdFab.exe instead of msvcr90.dll"
,JetsetJoey,2012-09-14T10:06Z,"@ sfx341110~
I think you are correct because with this patch I performed the same 2 steps just as I did every time before when upgrading:
1) install program right over the previous version.
2) copy/replace dll file

Because it didn't work this time, I even used Revo Uninstaller, rebooted, installed fresh, copied/replaced dll & STILL ""Trial User & Expire"" !"
,JetsetJoey,2012-09-14T10:09Z,"I think I tried everything & still no success!!!
1) Completely uninstalled previous version with Revo Uninstaller Pro.
2) Rebooted & did a fresh install.
3) Copied/replaced the dll file in the directory.
4) Rebooted again.
5) Disconnected network & disabled Auto Update.

Will you please aid me???

Where are you???

Read my posts!"
,jammerking,2012-09-14T18:18Z,"JetsetJoey  
What is your OS and version 32 or 64bit?

Be sure to run with Admin privilege  
After running Revo Uninstaller Pro. Did you manually search your registry and delete all DVDFab results?  (besure to backup registry first).

after reboot you should recheck registry to be sure other security programs didn't restore any DVDfab entries.

After install did you run auto crack? which one version?

You then rebooted with ever starting DVDFab right?

After you disabled internet and started DVDFab did you get a popup to check for update?  if so click ok to check.  otherwise this could be a possible reason.

You should see ""never expire"" for all programs and be able to start.

"
,jammerking,2012-09-14T18:19Z,You then rebooted withOUT ever starting DVDFab right?
,ganlinia,2012-09-14T20:27Z,"tried everything from the comments and never worked for me, the last version worked for me was 8.2.0.0 . (for both laptop & desktop) versions after that i get trial user / expired. mine doesn't have popup ""check for update"" btw"
,jammerking,2012-09-15T03:05Z,"I installed it on a recent new install of Windows Ultimate  64bit on a new HD my other HD crashed. I only saw the pop up once when I first started up DVDFab after crack, reboot and disabling internet.  Now I only see the window showing never expire for all the DVDFab programs hen I start it.

In the past cleaning the registry of DVDFab has worked when I had that problem.

My best guess is that some traces of previous DVDfab installs remain somewhere on your system.  

Move ChattChitto RG download to a removable drive /media and disconnect that drive.

I would try manually cleaning the registry again of any DVDFab references  (please search how to do this safely if you don't know how)  Delete temporary files after closing all your programs. 

Reboot and search again if traces of DVDfab are still there then run a complete virus scan and create a restore point. Do a system backup.  Then disable restore mode, internet connection, antivirus, firewall and other security software.  

Reboot with disabled restore mode, internet connection, antivirus, firewall and other security software.and scan again for traces of DVDfab delete and reboot.

Try re-installing, apply crack, reboot and starting software hopefully you will get an update popup and ok. start program and Common settings-> General - UN-CHECKED check for new version automatically and saved. close program.

Try running it to see if it works.  Then you can re-enable restore mode, internet connection, antivirus, firewall and other security software

If your still having a problem Try looking elsewhere for a solution. I am sure [ChattChitto RG] is very busy and may not have time to help those who are having a problem.

so far +8 -1 seams that most downloaders are not having a problem."
,rhm1956,2012-09-15T11:59Z,Works Great on Win-XP Thanks!
,JetsetJoey,2012-09-15T19:35Z,"@ jammerking~
firstly, thanks for your attention. I'm running 7 Ultimate 64-bit. It is a fresh install on a new system. Yes, I selected Run as Administrator & yes after failure & using Revo to uninstall, I ran regedit & manually removed all traces. Also, I can say yes to all your other questions.

Here's the big mystery: WHY am I having such difficulty now when I've been using Chitto's patches for years?!? Also, condidering the fact that everytime I installed a new version I just installed over the old version, replaced the msvcr90.dll & was good to go!!! So WHY NOW?!?"
,jammerking,2012-09-16T01:12Z,"JetsetJoey 
 Sorry your having this problem.  Did you get the popup small window to check for an update when you first started DVDFab?   I am not an expert and don't know coding so can't offer anymore suggestions.

If you do get it to work please let us know"
,JetsetJoey,2012-09-16T19:05Z,"@ jammerking~
YES I did get the pop-up update window & YES I was disconnected from the Internet & YES I unchecked ""Check for new version automatically."" 

However, upon restarting it still says ""Trial User""! One noteworthy thing is that EVERY time I install the program, the date under the version 8.2.1.0 at the top left of the window is 7/29/12 & the Trial User Expiration date is one month after!

ANY SUGGESTIONS ANYONE ELSE?!?"
,jammerking,2012-09-17T18:30Z,"When I start DVDFab 8 Qt I get a splash screen that shows 
DVDfab 8.2.1.0

Then I get a welcome to DVDFab window
listing all the software DVDcopy etc Licensee Team BBB, JohnWho, Enabled Yes , Never Expires for all options.

When I start DVDFab 
shows DVDfab 8.2.1.0 (07/09/2012) top left of window
  all the programs are listed to the left and work"
,jammerking,2012-09-17T18:38Z,"JetsetJoey 

""YES I did get the pop-up update window & YES I was disconnected from the Internet.""  Did you confirm that you clicked OK to this popup window and then click start DVDFab then under settings  remove the auto check? "
,JetsetJoey,2012-09-17T23:02Z,"@ jammerking~
YES, I did click ""OK"" to the pop-up & YES I did disable ""Check for new version automatically.""

I made a mistake & the date on the top left of the window next the version 8.2.1.0 is 7/09/2012. Also, when I click on Help & then About, all the Options show ""Trial User"" & the Udate Expire Time is 2012-Oct-08.

I've performed this procedure soo many times prior so WHY am I suddenly having a problem?!?"
,testerdo,2012-09-18T07:46Z,"Dear JetsetJoey 
I have the same problem as yours for several DVDFab version updates. The cracked msvcr90.dll just can't work on one of my PC. After all, only two ways can work for me:
1. Use BRD's crack (but now only up to 8.2.0.0)
2. Use DVDFab_8210_portable.rar"

[V],ChattChitto,2012-09-18T17:56Z,"Can you please try and use YourUninstaller PRO to uninstall DVDFab? use the ""SuperMode"" to uninstall it.
once done, it will ask you whether u wish to uninstall the leftovers (files & registry entry) accept.
Once done, Run as administrator the release and install DVDFab v8.2.1.0
Once installed click on automated cracking 2 and choose your desktop as destination.
you now have the cracked file on your desktop, manually drag it and place it instead of the original one in program files.
let us know :)"

2) Ran/installed DVDFab as administrator.
3) Used Automated Cracking 2 & dragged the msvc.dll file from my desktop to target directory.

,Ponyoo,2012-09-20T14:06Z,"@JetsetJoey 
OK  I just perfectly found it out.  You don't need to check the regstry at all.
The problem is Window's system locale language. 
Your Windows' ""system locale"" must be English.

Go to Control Panel's  language section(language, clock, location),  go to ""language and location"" then ""control"" which is talking about ""program's language if it isn't in Unicode""   Choose ""English"" then restart your computer. 

The patch works perfectly under English system locale,  but when you back the system to non-English, DvdFab will be back to ""Trial User"".

If you don't want to change your system locale in English, then use the v8.2.0.0 patch.  It's the latest crack for non-English system.   "
