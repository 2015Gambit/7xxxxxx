,2HardRain,2012-09-10T11:49Z,"Soon friend, soon."
,kustone,2012-09-10T14:06Z,bitrate 8000 is 720?! what  happened with 4000-5000?
,phase700b,2012-09-10T14:33Z,"These new releases are usually never VBR, so they're large. Need to wait a while for some smaller VBR encodes to show up. They take longer to encode."

At last we can see all Indiana Jones movies in HD format.

,enonumus,2012-09-16T10:22Z,"Very slow download as of 9/15.  Averaging 30-50K/s for the first 24 hours so far.  Might want to try the individual torrents which are much faster currently, rather than this quadrilogy.   At least until there are more seeders."
,.Leto.,2012-09-20T20:43Z,"Indeed this is rather slow, I've been downloading this for 17h at an average of 200Ko/s. Will comment on quality once it's done."
,.Leto.,2012-09-22T04:13Z,"According to several reviews the quality of the original blurays isn't particulary awesome, they could have done a much better job. So it's not the encoder's fault if some scene are too dark or too grainy (specially in the first one). I've spotted a few errors in the english subtitles but that's easy to edit and fix.
Thanks for the rip."
,.Leto.,2012-09-23T15:09Z,"So I finally finished watching them all completely, picture/audio quality and release date go together. Several problems with the 1 (a bit disappointing considering the amazing job done by Spielberg with Jaws), a few with the 2, 3 and 4 are perfect."
