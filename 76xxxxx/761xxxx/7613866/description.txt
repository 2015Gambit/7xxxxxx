How the Universe Works Series 2
The universe is made up of wondrous statistics that detail the incredible range between large and small, near and far, and light and dark - but what any of these inexact terms really describe is still open to debate. We are surrounded by laws that govern everything - determining the colour of the stars, the gravity controlling our solar system and the beginning and end of the universe itself.


1)  Volcanoes - The Furnaces of Life 
Today's technology lets us study the cosmos as never before. The universe is full of billions of stars, planets and moons. In all this vastness, could we really be alone? What makes Earth so different? Part of the answer is this: volcanoes. If there weren't volcanoes here we would not be here either. On Earth, volcanoes are part of the planet-wide energy machine that makes life possible. Now, space probes and powerful telescopes are discovering volcanoes on worlds we once thought dead. From our nearest planetary neighbor to tiny moons billions of miles away, today we are discovering volcanoes on alien worlds. Are these worlds where, tomorrow, we might find life?
