Originally published in 1979, this particular version was published in 1991. Amazingly, this tome only covers Wrightson's work through his time at 'The Studio'...

...in 1979. Pretty mind-blowing when you consider he was only 31 years old at the time and continued to work until a least a few years ago (possibly to this day, he's only 63, I'm just not sure what he's doing currently). I would feel supremely confident in saying that he did more comic book work after this book was published in 1979 than before.

Much like Barry Windsor-Smith's 'Opus', 'A Look Back' is part art book and artist portfolio, part biography and part historical document. But where 'Opus' veered more clearly into comic book territory, 'A Look Back' stays much more in the realm of artwork. Hundreds of images, many of them full-page, over 100 pages in color.
