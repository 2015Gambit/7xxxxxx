,gravitysewers,2012-09-10T20:54Z,There might be something wrong with this one. I've been downloading for 4 hours and still haven't finished. Utorrent's stats say I'm connected to 0 seeds and there's only .511 availability.

I opened up my bandwidth all the way to flood the swarm with data. Should be plenty of complete copies out there now. Let me know if it's still not working, though."
