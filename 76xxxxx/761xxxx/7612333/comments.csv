,scottycdl,2012-09-09T21:20Z,"BitDefender reports the EXE file as having a virus and refuses to play it!

Also, the BAT file kicks off the EXE file, then dumps you back to a D.URL - [edit the BAT file and remove the D.URL reference to stop this]

Please let us know if you get this game to work on your system . . . "
