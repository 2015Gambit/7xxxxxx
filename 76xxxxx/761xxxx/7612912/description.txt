The fucking savages at MTV cut to a dead camera during our
beloved Taylor's performance which caused a 3 or so second
loss of video. It was in the raw feed both on MTV and MuchMusic
in Canada. The subsequent reair had this fixed. We hate to repack
but we love Taylor too much. This was through no fault of our own
It was broadcast that way. See /SAMPLE if you don't believe us. Had
we known we'd have waited

If you don't care about Taylor, don't redownload. If you do then do
redownload. However if you don't care about Taylor, then we are never
ever getting back together with you

Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X
