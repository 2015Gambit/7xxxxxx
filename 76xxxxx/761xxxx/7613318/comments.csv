,jh5637,2012-09-09T05:53Z,"@crowenterprises - Dude! WTF?! What freakin phone do you have? This is awesome for a cam made with a damn phone. Way better than other cams I've seen...and the audio is excellent for a freakin phone cam. And you're right dude..you should be given your due credit for the source, but also give credit to those who make your upload a lil bit better. I'll repost this on all the current torrents for ya.

For being a cam copy:
A:8
V:8
M:6 (Hollywood has lost their grip on the whole horror genre. IMO)"

,DownunderReviews,2012-09-11T15:41Z,"A:7
V:7
Movie:5

Good quality for a cam, very watchable. The plot is lacking a bit of originality but still a pretty decent movie.
