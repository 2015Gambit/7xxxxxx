I noticed there was not a complete set of English dubbed Soul Eater episodes in HD on TPB at the moment. That is not acceptable. So here they are just like the name says, all 51 episodes and even all the endings and openings. All files were downloaded from Kametsu's IRC channel (which was a tedious pain in the arse).
