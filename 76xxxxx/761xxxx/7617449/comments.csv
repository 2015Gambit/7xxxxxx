[V],err0001,2012-09-10T08:05Z,"I've downloaded and checked this file. The audio doesn't play for me in Windows Media Player, but works fine with GOM Player. The audio also works fine on a WD TV Live Hub box. Gspot reports that the audio is AC3 - maybe you don't have a codec installed for that? It probably doesn't work on WMP in my system because I disabled AC3Filter when my system went a bit wonky after installing it. "
