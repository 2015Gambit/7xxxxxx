New.Zealands.Got.Talent.S02E01.HDTV.xvid-][ Season 2,Auditions Day 1 ][ 09-Sep-2012 ] avi


converted a MP4 to xvid 360p mp3 cbr 128 1000bitrate

Rachel Hunter as one of the judges.. the auditions of talents are
the only real parts I like to watch.. so I may not make xvids of the
entire season but heres the first one anyhow

I think Britain's got talent is the only one any good though

alot is to do with the sort of judges and how rude they are
and the bulk of nut jobs wanting to stand up and make fools of themselves
I think :)


Enjoy and help to seed!
