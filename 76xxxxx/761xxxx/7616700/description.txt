*After you download the pack please comment to let users know its clean from malware etc.

I don't take credit for making any soundfonts, just downloading em from different sites and making the pack! all freeware from the sites i got them from if you want to avoid pirating etc.. yes im aware what site your on.. theres over 1.25 gb uncompressed
 

Extract the pack to c:>Program Files > Image Line > FL Studio > Data > Patches > Packs and you can organize any folders you want in here. Technically you can make FL look at any folder, this is just the root so its the easiest. 


SHARING IS CARING! my fuckin isp gives me 2.5mb down and about 200 kb/s up so i'll do my best to seed on my side. but i currently have 7 and hopefully more soon.
