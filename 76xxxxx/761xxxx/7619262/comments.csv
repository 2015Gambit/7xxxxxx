,cesc4fcb,2012-09-16T15:45Z,@Performer81  wat program do i hav to uninstall
,whipship,2012-09-17T18:28Z,"If you want to change your language just do that:
Got to the ""Sleeping Dogs.v1.5 +12 DLCS"" folder and open the SKIDROW.ini file with notepad or text editor.
change language=russian to language=english or language=spanish or language=german and so on.
Try to save the changes if it says that you dont have permissions for that move the file to the desktop, change the language and drag it back into the SD folder.
Then run the Launcher.exe as an administrator and choose your language (Usually, the language you typed in the SKIDROW.ini file should be selected already). CLick save&launch and you're done! Have fun!"
