,craniumbox,2012-09-10T07:44Z,Cant unzip the file.
,mac04770,2012-09-10T09:55Z,"Ok i finally got it, a very long process.
From the problems i had trying to un-Rar you will need the latest version of stuffit.
You can try this for starters:

http://www.stuffit.com/downloads/mac-stuffit.html

Once i unpacked it, it installed and allows the serial (provided) to be placed inside.
Hope all this helps."
