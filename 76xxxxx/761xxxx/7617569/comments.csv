,gravitysewers,2012-09-10T02:43Z,Thank you. Do you have anything from Charles Burns? I'm looking for Big Baby specifically.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-10T07:38Z,"Most welcome gravitysewers.

I've uploaded all the Charles Burns I have at the moment (other than Black Hole, which was already up). I've been trying to get some of the other stuff myself. I'll do some reaching out and poking around, see what I can come up with."
