,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T21:31Z,"Kinda suckish that you take credit for my work, PLEASE give proper credit."
,smokey456,2012-09-08T22:01Z,this is the same one as yesertdays. THEY ARE TAKING SOMEONE ELES CREDIT. CROWENTENPISES COPY.MP4
,Pmoney559,2012-09-08T22:49Z,I agree thats crowenterprises credit. Why even put the same torrent up 5 more times? Makes no sense.
[V],scene4all,2012-09-08T23:00Z,"@crowenterprises, no ones taking credit for ur work, next time at least specify ur name or ur groups name on the release and add an nfo, so that proper credit can be given."
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T23:03Z,"@scene4all dont u worry about that my work for now on will be watermarked U are posting this as YOUR OWN Work which is complete bullshit. ""The.Possession.2012.Cam.Rip.XviD-FANTA "" declares ur stealing credit for the work. "
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T23:06Z,"Many posted my work on share sites as a streamer they never said it was ""their work"" or had their group name on it. That's called RESPECT but to put your name on someone Else's work? that is bullshit. "
,togood4u,2012-09-08T23:50Z,Thanks Crowenterprises :-)
[V],scene4all,2012-09-08T23:52Z,"@crowenterprises, lol this isn't totally ur work, the source might be urs but the encode isn't. You might be new here, so let me explain how things work around here. When a source is given, groups re-encode it which means they put time and effort into the release and they have full right to tag it as their own, coz they encoded it. Like i said before, if you did mention ur name or ur groups name on ur release then proper credit would be given."
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T00:13Z,fuck u is all i can say 
[V],scene4all,2012-09-09T00:44Z,"lol, i told you already, if you had some brain you would check the file size for ur torrent and my torrent and notice that they aren't the same, which mean this is a re-encode. Your the one who's trying to take credit for someone else's work."
,macstar2012,2012-09-09T01:10Z,"@crowenterprises i know it may seem as though they are steeling your work, and props to you on your first piece, but what Scene4all is trying to say is people and groups alike take uploads such as yours  and make adjustments to them in order to improve the original release. Not that your rip was crap, i am speaking in general of all uploaded cams/ts. So i was just trying to ease your mind a little as this is a very well used method. Granted i agree that credit is do and most people give credit to the original uploader, but then you get people that don't. Just take a quick sec when you upload a file to add a quick info text. Example: Uploaded by crowenterprises 9/7/12 Please seed enjoy:) something like that, then no one can try slipping a fast one and say that there was no info and that's why no credit was given. But crowenterprises if you decide to watermark something just be sure not to leave it for the entire film just a  quick wm will do:) Again thanks crowenterprises for the up and to those tweaking this up thanks to you all as well."
,macstar2012,2012-09-09T01:12Z,so after all that lol..A/V? Anyone?
,xsadx,2012-09-09T01:18Z,"@crowenterprises

,coolu812,2012-09-09T03:26Z,"scene4all, thanks for putting all this great stuff out there."
,stumpybob,2012-09-09T03:39Z,"more entertaining than this movie is crownenterprises crying over his ""credits"""" sounds like that little ""give us our precious"""" troll in Lord Of The Rings , hey crowne, this is PIRATES bay. Get a grip."
,xsadx,2012-09-09T04:43Z,"A5 V6(for a cam), a it shakes a little, but its watchable. Thanks for the upload.  "
,kulguy,2012-09-09T05:12Z,"in my whole life i didn't c such print.......
its worthless to watch this movie by this print...."
,jh5637,2012-09-09T05:52Z,"@crowenterprises - Dude! WTF?! What freakin phone do you have? This is awesome for a cam made with a damn phone. Way better than other cams I've seen...and the audio is excellent for a freakin phone cam. And you're right dude..you should be given your due credit for the source, but also give credit to those who make your upload a lil bit better.  I'll repost this on all the current torrents for ya.

For being a cam copy:

,dark_illusions,2012-09-09T06:16Z,all i got to say is who cares really its up here and honestally i dont give a rats behind if crownenterprices made it or the starship enterprise its not bout who put the thing up its bout whats put up this torrent thing is not about getting your name out there and all that crap cuz honestally idc who u are as long as its good then ill rate it if its good thats all there is to it

,chaoz222,2012-09-09T22:12Z,"Well a few things in regards to the previous comments.

1] In scene's defense, this website is about pirating.

2] In crowen's defense, there is a thing called 'Honor Amongst Thieves'.

And in my opinion, Crowen deserves a lot more credit than Scene.  Take the song, ""Apologize"" for example.  Most people gave Timbaland credit.  But One Republic created it.  All Timbaland did was add a few things.

Crowen took the risk at the movie theater.  All Scene did was sit back on his/her big comfy chair, adjust some settings and what not, and sat back enjoying all the praise.  Should be, Crowen feat. Scene.

Scene was nicer than Crowen, but Scene also gives off this ""High and Mighty"" vibe.  So Crowen, either add the watermarks/nfo's/both and accept Scene's apparent sincerity, or add those, and believe Scene's remarks were just a smartass way of saying fuck you, i'll take ur shit if i want.

,chaoz222,2012-09-09T22:14Z,i didn't mean apparent :P
,lucien1915,2012-09-10T00:14Z,"@crowenterprises Karma is a bitch isn't it. You stole and got stolen from, so stop carrying on like a bitch about it. Put your name on the work you do next time"
,ShrikeStar,2012-09-10T11:02Z,Why is it i.e the previous 2 posters that they build the movie up as if it were a masterpeice then drop theyre shitty lil web addys at the end...they on commission or what?
,Crazy-Nish69er,2012-09-11T00:01Z,"I Give This Audio 1, Video 0...So Basically is fucken sucks"
,turtlelaviada,2012-09-11T10:44Z,"a couple of years ago i had a friend knock on my door, he was fucked up in everyway a guy can be.. he was withdrawing from heroin and he had just lost his job so i took it apon myself to help this guy and get him back on his feet.. i took care of this asshole for a year got him his new job and helped him kick his habbit.. his name was Ole Bornedal and he is the director of this shitty movie so if anyone should get the credit for this movie its ME!!! so fuck u all!!!!.......................jk"
,Casull454,2012-09-13T21:18Z,"crowenterprises, you actually insist on taking a credit for this POS release. So I have you to thank for this garbage? Great, I'll memorize your name to avoid it in future! 

I agree with this guy, people should really be credited properly!"
,chief16,2012-09-14T06:38Z,"@crowenterprises  A) you're a bitch,  B) show respect for the ppl that try to turn your POS rip into something we can watch, and C) you're still a bitch"
,BKKJack,2012-09-14T08:10Z,"Oooh my, what a kerfuffle over fuck all.

Some folks need to get a life....or have a damn fine angry wank...."
