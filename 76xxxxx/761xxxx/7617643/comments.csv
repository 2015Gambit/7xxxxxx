,xXHATFIELDXx,2012-09-10T03:59Z,Why is nobody ever seeding? I always seed at least during the download if everyone did only this they would get the files much quicker. In and Out. Boom bada bing! Instead everyone turns the upload speed down to nothing and noone gets the file in a good time.
,freeegatee,2012-09-10T04:19Z,"Thanks Froggie100!

,atomic1221,2012-09-10T09:13Z,"All shoddy audio can usually be fixed with good vlc audio settings. Here are mine:

""GRAPHIC EQUALIZER""

PRESET: FLAT
ENABLED
2 PASS: Yes
PREAMP: 10.4DB
60HZ: -14.3DB
170HZ: -9.4DB
310HZ: -1.7DB
600HZ: +0.7DB
1KHZ: -0.47DB
6KHZ: -2.70DB
14KHZ: 7.2DB

with these settings the movie is 10x more watchable. I have an ear for these things so I hope I make your experience more enjoyable. If you don't like it, then I apologize, I tried my best.
