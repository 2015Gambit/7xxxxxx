Notes -
was given dvd5 vob files before hand which had german, french audio on... but no english pmsll.. so waited hours and 

hours for the winnie13 dvdr to download so i could strip the eng studio audio of it and mux it over my encode.. so 

here it is... enjoy.. just for the sake of it i will do a v2 using the larger vob files... enjoy .
