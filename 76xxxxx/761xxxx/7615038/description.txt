Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 (2012)
----------------------------------------------

It is ten years after an aging Batman has retired, and Gotham City has sunk
deeper into decadence and lawlessness. Now, when his city needs him most,
the Dark Knight returns in a blaze of glory. Joined by Carrie Kelly,
a teenage female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat
of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. And after facing off
against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the
final time, Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former
ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive.
