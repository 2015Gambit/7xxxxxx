freQazoidiac - LPCD 
(LPCD is digitized audio files from original LP vinyl pressings - and then package of .aiff files you can drag and drop to master to CD format without
any reconversion)

In it's complete form, as an LP this fun and electronic funky
pastiche of new sounds (for the early 80s) is surprisingly hard
to find. The single IOU was a smash and is easy to pick up
in various forms and mixes. The rest of the album is 
better than that hit IMO and stands up with various to become
very used styles in popular music. Just see who's behind the music
and one can understand why this has such a great groove for
the dance floor and spiritual well-being in the 21st century.
Taken from the Canadian Pressing. In the graphics included
I scanned the rare 1st issue cover with the ice blocks from the
streewise issue cassette.
