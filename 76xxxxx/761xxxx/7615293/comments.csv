WARNING: I can no longer switch back to ""Digi CoreAudio Device"" for regular sound playback. Hoping I can tinker around and figure out why it is permanently stuck on ""XVX device"" full time. 

This wasn't the easiest to get running for me... but seems to be going fine now minus audio switching funstionality...

Instructions for Lion:

1. Mount the .DMG, I suggest switching to ""list view""
2. click ""2nd. Install Pro Tools HD.mpkg"", computer will restart
3. click ""3rd. Installer"" , Check Everybox and Install
4. Go into your ""Mac HD"" (not user) and create a folder named ""Extra"" in your Library. It will ask for permissions, grant them. Inside the folder called ""Extra"" Make a sub folder called ""Extensions""
5. Drag the folder ""Digidesign Hardware Emulator v1.3"" to your Desktop.
6. Open ""Digidesign Hardware Emulator v1.3 Folder and click install.
7. Restart your Computer
8. Open Pro Tools Compatibility Patcher > Run ""Driver Patcher"" > click on ""Please Select Device"" the dropdown should reveal ""XVX Device"" > Install
9. Restart Computer
10. Open Pro Tools

Can anyone tell me how to get my ""Digi CoreAudio Device"" option back for regular playback? Whenever I select it it goes back to XVX immediately after switching my devices from both the volume panel (whilst holding option) and the actual ""Sound Preferences Panel"" in ""System Preferences"""
