,Carfrito,2012-09-08T05:54Z,how do we know this will work?
,V1ct0r1us,2012-09-08T07:26Z,What do you mean work? This is just to install the game for the people having trouble downloading it from Arena Net. I only made this because a friend was having trouble. This does NOT allow you to play without a valid account and key code.
,truefurby,2012-09-11T13:01Z,Thank you for this. :)
,truefurby,2012-09-11T13:03Z,"But please, seeeeeed moar!"
,rathel,2012-09-12T15:28Z,"Just curious, why a single rar? Wouldn't it better to keep the isos seperate? "
,tonnap,2012-09-17T16:29Z,"thx for this, my computer just goes bluescreen when it has been downloading for a couple of hours, and then I have to start all over again. "
,tonnap,2012-09-17T16:30Z,with the original download client I mean.
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-09-21T04:52Z,Why would you dl 13.47 GiB if we can't even play the game. Next time be way more specific. Say something like 'THIS GAME WON'T WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE A VALID ACCOUNT AND KEY CODE'
