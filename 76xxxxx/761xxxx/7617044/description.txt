The Foo Fighters' second album, their first as a "real band" (the first was just a Grohl solo project, essentially) has stood the test of time remarkably well. It has the all-too-rare combination of hard rock and melody. From the outstanding "Monkey Wrench" to the dramatic closer "New Way Home," the cd works as individual songs and as an album as a whole.

This edition with bonus tracks doesn't really offer anything new, but only enhances an already excellent cd by conveniently gathering together the b-sides from this era. I wouldn't describe the b-sides as necessary for anyone other than the hardcore fans (though, if you don't already own this album, you might as well get this edition.)

For those new to the Foo Fighters, this is a great place to start, but don't let the "special edition" stuff fool you: the real greatness of this cd is the main album itself.
