This torrent includes the Naruto Shippuuden episodes 113-140 in the highest quality. This video is the uncut Japanese version, which was broadcast on Japanese television. And at the same time, it dubbed in English. It also contains the original Japanese audio.
This is really 720p, uncompressed RAW format. Really English dubbed, not subbed.
English sound synchronized with Japanese video by me. I did it for myself, for my  own collection of Naruto. But if someone will like my work, I will be happy.
