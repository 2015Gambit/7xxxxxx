In a series of special 30-minute programs journalist Bill Moyers
speaks with guests from the humanities and faith communities to
explore the background and aftermath of the terrorist attacks on
New York City and Washington, D.C.

In the wake of the devastating national tragedy of September 11, 2001,
a stunned America was forever changed. Realizing the importance of
a national dialogue in understanding the cause for the terrorist attacks
and planting the seeds that would begin the long and painful healing
process, award-winning journalist Bill Moyers sat down with a diverse
group of key experts to discuss the sensitive issue a mere 36 hours
after the fall of the World Trade Center. Through conversation with
such guests as authors Robert Jay Lifton and Tamim Ansary, Moyers
captures a nations grief and hope while simultaneously creating an
unforgettable snapshot of a key moment in world history.

Two days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the
United States, Bill Moyers began interviewing people about the
significance of what had happened. It may have seemed too soon for
such reflection, yet one could make the case that thoughts expressed
by Moyers's guests in the immediate aftermath entirely outclass the
countless hours of news and analysis shows that followed.

The interviews are vintage Moyers, who sits and quietly speaks one-on-one
with such people as author Robert J. Lifton, Harvard religion professor
Diana Eck, theatrical director Julie Taymor, and Afghan-American
editor and writer Tamim Ansary (whose passionate explanatory e-mail
about Afghanistan was widely circulated on the Internet soon after
the attacks).

People talk of good and evil, religion and mythology, heroism and
humanity, all with a level of nuance never to be found on the cable
network shoutfests. No one raises his or her voice, yet much of what
is said will resonate in one's thoughts after the TV tube has grown cold.
