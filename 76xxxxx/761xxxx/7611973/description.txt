SATA as AHCI
ACPI as S3
LegacyUSB as ON
UEFI Boot to OFF (In Some MotherBoards it May Cause to Stuck on Boot0 Error)
and Remove All Unnecessary USB Devices Except KB and Mouse

This Distro Support MBR so You Can Erase The First Partiton as "Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)"

It is Better to try USB Installation
