Calisthenics are a system of exercise movements which generally do not use equipment. The goal of these exercises is to build strength, flexibility, and physical grace with movements that use only your own body weight for resistance. Calisthenics can boost both muscular and cardiovascular fitness when practiced with enough effort and variety in the exercises.
