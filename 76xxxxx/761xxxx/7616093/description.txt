Earth Wind and Fire (uh it's not even that simple)
You get........
walter "JUNIE" Morrison !!!!!  

Here is his first solo album from 1975.
Going through the entire gamut of soul, funk and disco
it's a masterpiece and may seem contrived to some
but it's only because it's been reforumlated and ripped
off by lesser entire bands..and this was mostly the work
of one Junie, who composed, directed, and played mostly everything
'cept the strings.
Shuggie Otis eat your heart out!..nuff respect Shuggs!

His follow up 70's albums are classics too, after this you get
FREEZE and then SUZIE SUPER GROUPIE.
I hope to  post those from original LP in the future.

** the cover has been rearranged to reflect the ongoing
offerings of the FREQAZOIDIAC. 
We try not to desecrate the original design, just
make our little update, but we put the original
cover in tact with the pdf file.

EFFECTS-NOISE SHAPING-REDUX

Recorded flat-

Minimal Declick applied with CLICKREPAIR 

* Although we use DeClick algorithyms with crackle
and pops, you may find on lower level 'ballad' passages there is some light noise. 
We  do not bother to touch or try to remove this type of noise
as is futile with any audio tools and we  can always hear the degration
if applied 
so even though this pressing was Excellent, it still had this noise but 
should not detract from the beauty of the audio on the LP, you can
remove it at your discretion, as even free audio programs will remove 
that type of noise, but also effect your sound..so be careful! 
Even converting this to MP3 or AAC will remove some of that sound
if need be for your portable device a bonus of those formats but
for those that know, you'll see it removes that and a whole lot of 
information you may enjoy. The compromise of the Lossy format.

NO Effects applied

NO Limiting/maximizing
