Requirements: Android 1.6+
Overview: Schedule Deluxe - the ultimate helper for school and study and everyone.
Timetable Deluxe - the ultimate tool for school, college and university.



This app is for organized students who want to have control of their whole school-routine, students who want to have an overview over their courses or parents who always want to have their kids timetable with them.
In addition it is also possible to comfortably administer homework and grades.
To put the matter in a nutshell, here are the top five reasons for getting Timetable Deluxe:
1.) Main function: Timetable
Free choice of colours for your courses.
Day- and (classic) week-overview, next X courses.
It's possible to create multiple timetables.
2.) very comfortable input-methods (without limitations):
speech recognition and date selection. Entries can be edited, copied and deleted.
3.) homework assignments with priority and due date
4.) Exams and grades
Exam dates can be created and grades including prioritization (Credit Points) can be added. The average is calculated automatically.
5.) Widget and backup-function
Note: widgets only work if the app is stored on the phone, NOT on SD-Card!
Have fun with the app.
