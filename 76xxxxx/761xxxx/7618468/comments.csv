,jadawgkss,2012-09-24T04:43Z,"No problem! Just glad my OCD tendencies were able to benefit someone other than myself. My first torrent ever, so I'm glad I wasn't flamed in the comments. Good to see. 

For what it's worth, I do this with almost every book I read that is similarly mangled, and I've found the best solution is usually to find another torrent. e-Book version 5.00 is usually a good indication that there won't be any errors. Anyway, I'll upload versions that I correct in the future. 

PS: Use Sigil if you want to do the same for your own books. Generate TOC to create chapter markers. "
