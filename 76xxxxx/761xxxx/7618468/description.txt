So, I went through the torrents available online, and no one had a perfect copy of this book. Being the OCD prick that I am, I decided to fix it, adding in chapters, and correctly delineating new lines, and so forth. 

There were only two misspellings in the copy you will find on TPB, but there were no chapters (which is important to me) and quotes were severely mangled, inserting new lines where one wasn't unnecessary, and not inserting new quotes in a conversation on new lines.
