,aero2zero,2012-09-12T09:06Z,"Your screenshot (hsampath) is showing a date few weeks earlier, since then that KMS server (benderrodriguez blabla) had stopped working."
,itsgonnarainism,2012-09-12T16:51Z,"This emulator is working.
1. First, if you are running an enterprise evaluation from Microsoft, after installation you will see a 90-day watermark at the bottom right of the screen. There is no need to run the emulator only if the trial is left with round 10 days.
2.Run the first emulator with elevated privileges(right click run with administrator.)This will be a quick process. Note: There is no need to disable or to turn off the internet connection.
3.You are done! The trial shows a 90-day before the expiration date. 
N.B. This is not an automated process by a program installed on the computer. You will need to run the scripts again once the trial expires. This emulator cannot be guaranteed of working after the non-evaluation Enterprise version is out. 
Last, thanks hsampath for the upload."
