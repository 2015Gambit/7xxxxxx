You know that Silent_Wolftears' Sunn O))) discography torrent is dead. I know that it's dead. People have been stalled at 19.2% for months, crying out for seeders. I wasn't able to download that collection either, but I've done the next best thing - I've recreated it.

Using the file list from that torrent as a guide, I've cobbled together everything from that torrent in the best quality I could find. It took me forever, for example, to find Solstitium Fulminate, the bonus disc from Black One, but I got it! This torrent contains EVERYTHING from the original torrent, minus a couple of exclusive tracks I couldn't find from some of the Japanese releases, and one single of a track that's already included. Support Sunn O))); buy everything that's still in print. And why not give Earth a listen while you're at it?
