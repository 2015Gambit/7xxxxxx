,analien8mycat,2012-09-10T16:04Z,@BBS: thanks for the upload ... BUT when the web links were removed in Acrobat 9 and the file saved the file became unreadable. Which suggests that this .pdf may 'call home'. Any insights?

I think the issue is probably with Acrobat 9.Some Pdf files will give errors in older versions and since you altered the Pdf by removing the links,I think that's what triggered the error.

Have you tried opening it with ""Foxit Pdf Reader"" if Foxit opens the file,then you know the issue is with Acrobat 9

If you don't have Foxit Pdf Reader you can download it for free,I use it to open Pdf files that Acrobat X Pro won't open"
,analien8mycat,2012-09-10T20:12Z,"BBS: Nah, I was worried about something far more sinister. Solution here is to 'examine document' and delete all flagged items other than 'bookmarks'. Then you can reformat to your heart's content. Plus file size reduces to 25MB :-)

Anyway, keep up the good work BBS!"

All my files come from one source only,I don't get them from websites or torrent sites,so don't worry about them being unclean or having  virus or malware embedded in them. :)"
