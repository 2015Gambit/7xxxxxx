I took benyaluxs excellent upload here:
 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7578217/King_Crimson_-_Discography_Remastered

and split the tracks, converted the APE files to FLAC using dBpoweramp (level 8) and made sure all tracks were properly tagged and embedded with high quality artwork.

Enjoy and thanks again benyalux....
