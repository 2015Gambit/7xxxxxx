,soanti,2012-09-10T05:36Z,Seed?
,iambobobo,2012-09-12T11:21Z,"Thanks for all the hard work, jim.

I don't suppose you have any content for Mary McCade, do you?"
,bobtheduck2011,2012-09-19T16:50Z,"So, even though this page indicates 0 seeds, my torrent client indicates as many as 64 seeds -- but my client won't connect to any of them. 

There are also about 300 peers indicated, of which I can connect to roughly 30 or 40 -- but the strange thing is that all the peers I am connected to are all hung at 88.5%.

Why is that? "
,bobtheduck2011,2012-09-24T18:37Z,It sure would be freaking awesome if Jim could come back and seed the last 11.5%... 
,bobtheduck2011,2012-09-25T19:14Z,"Although its great to see even a single seed appear on this torrent, it doesn't seem to have helped at all, for some reason. 

All the 30-40 peers I am connected to are still all stuck at 88.5%.

I wonder if someone who could seed this might just try starting another torrent..."
