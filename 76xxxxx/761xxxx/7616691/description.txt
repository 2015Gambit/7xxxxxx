The bad guys are the good guys in this blockbuster Vietnamese martial arts shoot-'em-up in which a band of outsiders, led by catlike Trinh (Thanh Van Ngo), battles a host of international meanies for control of a communications satellite. Trinh's trump card is ex-con Quan (Johnny Nguyen), who moves with sweaty grace through a bullet ballet studded with fight sequences, tender moments and car chases through the rained-out streets of HCM City.
