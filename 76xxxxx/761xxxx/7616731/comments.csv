,Fapguy,2012-09-11T03:04Z,"@Yberman33 - the IMDB link is correct. Please use your eyes before spewing any unnecessary bullsh*t.

8/8"

Though the screenshot provided is full of black people... Makes little sense :P"

There are no riots.  It has a different director listed and actors than the imbd link. 

And it's boring as hell.  Another movie about drug sellers in a depressed area.

This movie cannot be found on imbd, I guess it was too low a budget film to make it into there data base.

The link on this page is for G.B.H. which was to be called riot but was renamed.  Released in cinemas in the UK today with DVD release the first of October."
