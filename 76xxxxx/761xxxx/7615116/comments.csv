,drop_dead99,2012-09-29T20:23Z,"Hey, do you think you could upload ""The Enemy"" series by Charlie Higson?

I've been looking everywhere for it but I can't find it. There are 4 books in all.

And if you have time, maybe the ""The Great Tree of Avalon"" series as well, by T.A. Barron? And the ""Septimus Heap"" series by Angie Sage?

Thanks a bunch!
Thanks a bunch!"

Bonus: I got the previous series as well, and they have new covers. This is it, right? Cuz I went through a lot of hassles to get it...

I hope this keeps you busy and reading  drop_dead99 :)"
,drop_dead99,2012-09-30T00:35Z,"Again, very quick response! Sir, you are made of awesome.

Though according to Goodreads, the fourth book was published 10 days ago, so maybe that's why you couldn't find it?

,drop_dead99,2012-09-30T00:44Z,"The Merlin series is a different one, but I wanted to ask you to upload that too, haha. So that's all good.

The Great Tree of Avalon series is only a trilogy. And it's okay, take your time. I have enough books to entertain myself for a while now."
,drop_dead99,2012-09-30T00:57Z,"Okay, disregard my previous comment about the Avalon books not being in there (though I'm not sure if it even showed up, for some reason comments don't seem to be working well).

Everything is in there, I'm just a bit tired and I didn't notice it, so I offer you my apologies, and once again, thanks for doing all this."
,drop_dead99,2012-09-30T00:58Z,Damn this comment section!
,tta64,2012-09-30T23:28Z,"yes, i know i'm awesome:

Plus I threw in an additional book as well. Well, I think I've done a pretty good job here, now haven't I?"
,drop_dead99,2012-10-03T12:58Z,"Wow dude, thanks a lot! I know I've said this before, but you really are fucking awesome xD. Sorry for the late reply by the way, but the site's been down for a few days.

Thumbs up to you!"
