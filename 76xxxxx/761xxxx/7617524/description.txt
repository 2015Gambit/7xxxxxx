In September 2008, in the early morning hours of the day, I was run down by a drunk driver, who left my body in the middle of the highway for dead. Well, two years later I woke up from a coma. I suffered broken back, legs, arms, and pelvis. My right foot had to be reattached. I was not expected to survive, and was told by doctors that I would never walk or be able to use my hands. I did not believe this one bit. 

 A friend of mine suggested I get a copy of The Secret. I did, and when I first began to read the book I knew it was powerful stuff. I asked God of the Universe to repair my body. Within two years not only can I do anything, I am stronger than before the accident. My mind is sharper than before, and I am so happy. 

 I asked God of the Universe for help financially, because the person that hit me had no insurance, license, or anything, so I just asked the universe for help. Within a few weeks the bills started coming - $ 1.5 million. I just wrote on each bill PIF (paid in full). And then I received a phone call that the State of Florida will be paying all my medical expenses. 

 I am no longer able to work, so I asked the Universe to provide an income for me. Within two days the checks started coming in very large amounts, and they haven't stopped yet. 

 I keep asking the Universe to help me over and over. I feel rich, in all areas of my life, I have more than enough money to do anything I ever dreamed, I have the car of my dreams the dream home, and more, all without a single dime out of my own pocket. 

 The Secret has changed my life, thank you so much. I am called "The Miracle" by all my friends and family.
