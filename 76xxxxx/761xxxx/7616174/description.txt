Release Notes:
--------
Bob Dylan's 35th album begins with a train whistle exploding in his mind. He
sees an old oak tree he used to climb and imagines a woman smiling through a
fence. He hears the voice of "the mother of our Lord" ΓÇô and still, that whistle,
screaming "like the sky's gonna blow apart." It's astonishing, " Duquesne
Whistle" suggests, how much can be channeled through a simple sound.
