May I read the whole book to You while at it?"
[V],azizex666,2012-09-07T22:13Z,"The novella follows the life - well, afterlife - of Mordy, who has recently committed suicide and found himself in a world not unlike the one he’s just left (”I’d always imagine these beeping sounds, like a fuzz-buster, and people floating around in space and stuff. But now that I’m here, I don’t know, mostly it reminds me of Tel Aviv.”)

It's a first person narrative story, pretty interesting."
