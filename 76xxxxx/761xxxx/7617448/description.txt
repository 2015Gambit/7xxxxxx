Meet Talking Tom's best "friend" Ben!

Ben is a retired chemistry professor who likes his quiet comfortable life, eating, drinking and reading newspapers. To answer it, you will have to bother him until he bend the paper. Then you can talk to him, poke him and tickle him, and even have a phone conversation.

Now, if you take Ben to the laboratory he'll be happy as a puppy. There you can do chemistry experiments by mixing two test tubes and see the hilarious reactions.

HINT: Record a funny video of your telephone conversation with Ben and send to your friends.
