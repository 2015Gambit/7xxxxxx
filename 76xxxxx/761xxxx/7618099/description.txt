I edited the 3 hour 1978 TV version of Salems Lot in to a 1hour54min version mainly by cutting out the love interest and adding in some Skinny Puppy and Autechre tracks.
This is my first upload so please feel free to comment, judge and criticize. I think the first one I uploaded doesnt work. This is my second try. Enjoy!
