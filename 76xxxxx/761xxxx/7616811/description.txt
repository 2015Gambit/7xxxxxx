"In the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Sam Harris's recent bestseller, The End of Faith, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion. With a close and erudite reading of the major religious texts, he documents the ways in which religion is a man-made wish, a cause of dangerous sexual repression, and a distortion of our origins in the cosmos. With eloquent clarity, Hitchens frames the argument for a more secular life based on science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe, and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix."

Notes: 

- This e-Book is not a repost of an available commercial PDF. Instead, it was lovingly scanned from the original book, OCR'ed, proofread, spellchecked, formatted and PDF'ed by me, which took a couple of weeks.

- There's already another posting of this book here ( https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5136778/Christopher_Hitchens_-_God_is_Not_Great_%28E-book%29_-_lg1991 ) but unfortunately appears as though it wasn't proofed or formatted after being OCRed, so I thought I'd undo this. I tried to clean this one up and preserve the original formatting and fonts as best as I could.

- Small caveats: There's some ragged margins on one page I couldn't get rid of, and I didn't adjust the page numbers in the references and index to match. But, who cares... we have Find!

- Christopher Hitchens died recently, so this isn't denying him any royalties. Wouldn't post it if it was.

- There's only a PDF as I find it a pain to convert to other formats... sorry. Feel free of course!

- Please bear with my connection... my upstream is very slow (even for a 1MB e-book.)
