,EternalOptimist,2012-09-10T20:22Z,"Glad to help :D

And yeah, I got all of Scud here too. But number 3 of the Tales of the vending machine was written and drawn by TenNapel. Works well as a standalone title, so I thought I'd post it here as well.

For anyone reading this who's unfamiliar with Scud - you should definitely read it. It is an amazing comic."
