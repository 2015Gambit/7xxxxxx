The [incomplete] works of Doug TenNapel, American comic book artist, well known for the video game series Earthworm Jim, and a bunch of other stuff. I couldn't find all of his works, but this torrent has a nice amount of them. A little over half. So I hope you all enjoy it!

1998 - Gear
1998 - Scud - Tales from the vending machine #3
2003 - Creature Tech
2004 - Tommysaurus Rex
2006 - Iron West

If anyone has Power Up, Ghostopolis, or any of the other missing comics, it'd be great if you could drop a link in the comments.


And as always, don't forget to seed, and most importantly, don't forget to support the artists! If you like it, buy it.

And thank you to all the original scanners for making sharing of these files possible.
