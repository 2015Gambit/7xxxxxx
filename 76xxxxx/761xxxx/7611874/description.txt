A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War
Most Americans consider Abraham Lincoln to be the greatest president in history. His legend as the Great Emancipator has grown to mythic proportions as hundreds of books, a national holiday, and a monument in Washington, D.C., extol his heroism and martyrdom. But what if most everything you knew about Lincoln were false? What if, instead of an American hero who sought to free the slaves, Lincoln were in fact a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in american history in order to build an empire that rivaled Great Britain's? In The Real Lincoln, author Thomas J. DiLorenzo uncovers a side of Lincoln not told in many history books and overshadowed by the immense Lincoln legend.

You will discover a side of Lincoln that you were probably never taught in schoolΓÇöa side that calls into question the very myths that surround him and helps explain the true origins of a bloody, and perhaps, unnecessary war.

"A devastating critique of America's most famous president."
ΓÇöJoseph Sobran, commentator and nationally syndicated columnist

"Today's federal government is considerably at odds with that envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. Thomas J. DiLorenzo gives an account of How this come about in The Real Lincoln."
ΓÇöWalter E. Williams, from the foreword

"A peacefully negotiated secession was the best way to handle all the problems facing Americans in 1860. A war of coercion was Lincoln's creation. It sometimes takes a century or more to bring an important historical event into perspective. This study does just that and leaves the reader asking, 'Why didn't we know this before?'"
ΓÇöDonald Livingston, professor of philosophy, Emory University

"Professor DiLorenzo has penetrated to the very heart and core of American history with a laser beam of fact and analysis."
ΓÇöClyde Wilson, professor of history, University of South Carolina, and editor, The John C. Calhoun Papers

"This is a scholarly, lucidly written work that is bound to generate robust, even heated, controversy.  It may very well end up revolutionizing our understanding of one of the great American icons." 
ΓÇöRalph Raico,  professor of history, Buffalo State College, and editor of The Roosevelt Myth 

"To the legions of Americans who regard Abraham Lincoln as a racial saint and a national demigod, Thomas DiLorenzo's The Real Lincoln will come as a rude awakening. Unlike his mythic representations as Honest Abe and the Great Emancipator, the real Lincoln dedicated his  political career  to  the establishment of a  corrupt system  of high  tariffs and corporate subsidiaries, and he was willing to plunge the nation into a bloody cataclysm in order to achieve his lifelong political aspirations." 
ΓÇöRobert Higgs,  Ph.D., author of Crisis and Leviathan
