Don't be fooled by this revisionism: Lincoln was the best friend the south had, when they killed him, his plans for reconciliation fell with him and bloody reconstruction began. The Union saved America as a nation (central government MUST have special powers to prevent anarchy) and avoided a weakened two-nation US.

Look DiLorenzo up on Wikipedia and you will find that he has been a supporter of a Confederate States of America, a follower of the cult of historical revisionism, affliated with the pro-secession League of the South, etc."
