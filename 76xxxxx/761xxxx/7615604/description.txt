War Documentary hosted by Peter McHugh, published by Military Channel in 2005 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

From the precision weapons of modern war to the aerial ballet of a dogfight, the gun camera has been a tool of reconnaissance and tactics since the dawn of flight and mechanized warfare. Climb into the cockpit as gun camera footage from nearly a century of war is analyzed, sometimes down to the frame, by a team of experts and the men who lived it.


1)  Moving Targets 
The unwritten rule of war is: if it moves, shoot it. From the speeding supply trains of World War II to the desperate convoys of the war in Iraq, discover details of a half-century of war, including a debriefing with a WWII ace and his gun camera footage.

2)  Air Supremacy 
Experience 500-mph dog fights, deadly strafing airfield runs and the gritty 50-caliber hell of helicopter warfare in Vietnam. Also includes unforgettable film from famed WWII B-17 Bomber Memphis Belle - actual combat footage dissected and analyzed for the first time!

3)  Fixed Targets 
Join Gun Camera on a search for the three B's: bunkers, bridges and buildings. Experience, firsthand, fixed target aerial assaults, including bombing runs over Europe and fiery attacks on the Vietnam jungle.
