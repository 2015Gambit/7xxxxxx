""Happier at Home"" by Gretchen Rubin
""Implosion"" by Joel C Rosenberg
""Death in Italy"" by John Follain

Thanks!!"
,tta64,2012-09-09T07:31Z,"I'm afraid to say that after doing a netwide search for these books I haven't found a successive one. Death in Italy takes me to Death in Perugia (so I'm not sure), Joel C Rosenberg returns many hits but implosion isn't one of 'em, and I can only find the happy project by Rubin.

Sorry if I have given any inconvenience.
Might I also add that these are very high thought books and require a deep understanding of the world around us, impressed I am indeed...

once again sorry, but don't hesitate to throw any other books at me, I'll definitely try

(excuses excuses yada yada) but i'm also low on funds at the moment, so buying is out of the question, sorry!"
