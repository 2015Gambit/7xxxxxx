for sharing.
I mentioned when I posted the Movie on a youtube account I would 
make a sound only release of the Music and incidentals from the movie.

It's from a 2000 DVD and there could be better DVD source by now. 
If anyone knows of source that is unedited and with no
anomalies like pitch wavering, bad cuts, fluctuating volume levels
please let me know and I will DO THE WHOLE DARN THANG OVER.

Hopin you funk fans like the sequence, the titles and the sound. 
It is single track MONO, that's what I was workin with.
