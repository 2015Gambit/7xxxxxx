Set between the years 1642 and 1660, "The Devil's Whore" charts the progress of the English Civil War.

In English culture some people like to idealize Oliver Cromwell as a great liberator: in real life he took over through a military coup, oppressed dissenting voices and enforced his puritan views on the nation, as well being a butcher to Irish Catholics in Drogheda and Wexford.

Cast is excellent: John Sim, Dominic West, Michael Fassbender and absolutely fantastic young actress Andrea Riseborough.

NOTE: Recommended. Do not be misguided by stupidly chosen title.
