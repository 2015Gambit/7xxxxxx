--
Underrated and underappreciated 1st LP from a sweet group out of Montreal Canada.  
This album is diverse but cohesive, the group (this being their first LP but together for at least 4  years according to the liner notes)holds dedicated to their own sound, which they achieve with art, hipness and grace. Cliff Edwards, the architect of the group and consequently in retrospect a confirmed canadiana cult artist, left after this LP, then the rest rendering themselves the name "the bells" by the time 'fly little white dove fly' came into fruition. If you like 'the free design', this sound is similar. Light and airy with some psych edges make this a very fine listen, covering a wide gamut of music possibilities. This is not a cheesy 'light' either. Stands as a rare canadian collectable, as it is not available on any other format than the original LP to my knowledge...?
