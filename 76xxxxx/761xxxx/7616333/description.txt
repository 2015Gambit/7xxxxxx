DVDINFOPro is a DVD information program written in Visual Studio V2010 C++ for Windows XPSP2, Vista, Windows 7 and later. It provides information and useful tools for DVD media. Both DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW types are supported. It follows in the tradition of DVDInfo, my first dvd application that was very successful. This new version is a result of listening to users criticisms, requests and suggestions, and applying this to the new version.

This program provides information & tools for:
- Blu-ray and HD-DVD
- DVD-R/RW
- DVD+R/RW burners
- DVD-R DL (Double Layer) burners
- DVD+R DL (Double Layer) burners
- DVD-ROM players.

DVDInfoPro also provides information on all CD players & burners.
