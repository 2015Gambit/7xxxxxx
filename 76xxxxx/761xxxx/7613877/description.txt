An unmanned spaceship hurtles towards certain destruction, unless the Doctor 
can save it, along with its impossible cargo... of dinosaurs! By his side are 
a ragtag gang of adventurers: a big game hunter, an Egyptian queen and a 
surprised member of the Pond family. But little does the Doctor know that 
there is someone else onboard who will stop at nothing to keep hold of his 
precious, prehistoric cargo.
