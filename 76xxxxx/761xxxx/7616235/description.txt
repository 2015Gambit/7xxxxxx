AC/DC is a band that has always worked from a relatively small palette of rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ roll sounds, showing an impressive focus in sound right out of the gate. ItΓÇÖs as though Malcolm and Angus Young, the brothers at the core of the group, knew exactly the sound that they were after when they put AC/DC together. And maybe they did, if their first recording, with the Marcus Hook Roll Band in 1973, is any indication.
