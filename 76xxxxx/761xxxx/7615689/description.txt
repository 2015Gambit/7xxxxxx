This is a documentary about Hannibal of Carthage, in my view his the best general of all times. Much greater and better than Alexander The Great. He took on the best army of that time and defeated it time and time again for 26 years, with a much inferior army that was always ill-equipped and lacking supplies. And he did that without any support from king or country.
