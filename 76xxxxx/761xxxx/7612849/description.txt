Live screen capture from the webcast. This is the best source I can come up with - better than nothing.
It can be a little finicky - as was the webcast. Many who purchased complained of quality issues and the lack of an on demand post show.
This is your chance to re-live the night!

Details:
Screen Capture -> FLV -> WMV
Sorry for the windows format - MAC users should be able to use FLC for MAC. The FLV files sucked...
This is the best video I know of, there was 40 mins of splash screen removed from the ends and middle (in between sets)
Thank you to the ripper - you know who you are  ;-)
