The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the LIVE Sunday, September 9 edition of Infowars Live, Alex breaks down court rulings that have effectively held banks above the law -- in essence, legalizing tyranny. Alex will also expose the media's mind-control ΓÇ£hoax factoryΓÇ¥ and how it spins disinformation campaigns to manipulate mass sleeping audiences. Also, a special report on the Agenda 21 hell visibly just down the road.
