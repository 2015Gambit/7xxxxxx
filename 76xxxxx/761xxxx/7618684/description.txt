The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's syntaxΓÇöit's learning to creatively solve problems so you can build something great. In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to Think Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to:

    * Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve
    * Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries
    * Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job
    * Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory
    * Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems

Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative artΓÇöand the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer.
