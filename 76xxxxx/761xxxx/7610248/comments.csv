,oohlah,2012-09-08T03:11Z,"I can verify, because I'm the one who converted the audiobook :). I shared it with a friend who posted this torrent.  I used wondershare media converter. I'm hoping somebody can comment on the quality, as I'm no audiophile :). the book itself is outstanding IMO. I can do more books if people like the quality. "
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-09-08T03:49Z,"Ok, so far we have ""Anonymous"" and @oohlah [who has no torrents]..."
,oohlah,2012-09-08T04:10Z,"This is true :)  but we all gotta start somewhere right?  ive been buying audiobooks for years, and finally bought one that i coudn't find anywhere on here. With all the press surrounding the book, i thought i could finally give back to this community. i only have my word, that this is legit with no issues. but i do understand the skepticism regarding the torrent."
,oohlah,2012-09-08T04:13Z,"oh yeah, regarding the specifics to the audiobook, its sample rate is 44100hz, 2 channel stereo, and bit rate of 128kbps."
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-09-08T05:55Z,"Hmm, 62 seeds and 421 peers and it's taking ""forever"" [hours] to download 375 MB??"
