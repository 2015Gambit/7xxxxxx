Review:
Soft indierock-tunes with Sjur Lyseids characteristic voice on top makes this a well worth wait.
Monzanos debut album is packed with hooks and twists, but it never fails to stay catchy. This is the most accessible Annie-release this far and should gain more listeners than any of our other releases.
Think somewhere between Built to Spill, the Weakerthans, Death Cab for Cutie and Superchunk.
