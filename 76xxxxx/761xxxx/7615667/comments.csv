,tibird,2012-09-09T12:10Z,not really into psychics and aliens things but this one does catch my eye a bit I might have to give it a go....thanks. Oh by the way theres a new series called bomb hunters that you might look into I seen the pilot and it was good. 
[V],psspss,2012-09-09T12:18Z,"i uploaded bomb hunters last time.. check my lists

I didnt bother with ep2 as afg is now doing the series

perhaps if you watched the best UFO documentaries I added months back you might get to like alien stuff too. I only add the best stuff not the whacky

I added heaps of psychic detectives shows on demon.. but sensing murder NZ you will like if still can source it its better then this show :)"

NZ one is the best.. also has some Aus episodes added to S02.. 
S03 wasnt too bad either"
