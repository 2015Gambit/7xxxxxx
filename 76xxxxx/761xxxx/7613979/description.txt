Issues 0-1 of 'The Biologic Show' Fantagraphics Books, 1994-1995 
Written and Illustrated by Al Columbia

The Biologic Show is a comic book series written and drawn by Al Columbia and published by Fantagraphics Books. The first issue, #0, was released in 1994, and a second issue, #1, was released a year later.

The comic's title is taken from a passage in the William S. Burroughs book Exterminator! (in the chapter "Short Trip Home"). The passage is briefly quoted at the beginning of the story "The Biologic Show" in issue #0, one of several references to Burroughs in Columbia's early work.

Each issue of The Biologic Show contains several short stories and illustrated poems. #0 introduces three of Columbia's recurring characters - the hapless, Koko the Clown-like Seymour Sunshine in the opening comic "No Tomorrow If I Must Return" and the brother/sister duo Pim and Francie in "Tar Frogs" (a story which first appeared in the UK magazine Deadline). Issue #1 is dominated by the 16-page "Peloria - Part One", intended as the first installment of a never-completed graphic novel. It introduces a third character, Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy, who reappears in Columbia's later comics.

Much of the material in The Biologic Show deals with unsettling subject matter such as mutilation, incest, and the occult. Kieron Gillen has characterized the series as "comics transgression in its purest form."
