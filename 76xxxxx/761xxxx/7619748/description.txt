Robotboy is a cute, cutting-edge, butt-kicking battle-robot, who dreams of becoming a real boy. Created by world-renowned scientist Professor Moshimo, Robotboy has the ability to superactivate into a fighting machine capable of destroying entire armies. This attracts the diabolical attention of supervillains intent on harnessing Robotboy's powers to enslave the world. So Moshimo sends Robotboy far away to live with his number one fan, Tommy Turnbull, in the peaceful Bay Area. Here the small bot experiences life from the point of view of a kid growing up within a real family. It's up to Tommy and his pals, super-rich Lola and super-obnoxious Gus, to keep the world's most powerful fighting robot safe. And that's no easy task when the supervillians include a crazy cloning scientist, a twisted party magician and a deranged billionaire with a giant Orang-Utan sidekick...
