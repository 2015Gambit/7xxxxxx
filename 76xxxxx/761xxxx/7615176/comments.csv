,wil__w,2012-09-09T20:31Z,"Hey guys -

This is the composer of Snapshot - WiL Whitlark. It's cool that you guys enjoy my music!  

If you like it - please consider buying it. We are a small indie company and our sales really determine whether or not we can continue to make games.  You can find us on steam under app id #204220.  The soundtrack is bundled with the game at a couple bucks more.

Thanks for supporting us.  We worked hard on the game and we're really glad people are enjoying it!"

,anon78,2012-09-11T23:24Z,stuck at 80%. help me help you.
,anon78,2012-09-11T23:46Z,so very close to being able to seed this out. 94% and all of the seeders dropped.
,anon78,2012-09-12T00:14Z,"Finally, done. Scanned with Norton and MB. It's clean. It's a great quality torrent, the quality is consistent over the entire soundtrack.

The soundtrack is very uplifting, it gives me a PixelJunk Monsters vibe when I listen to it.

Would highly recommend you buy this off Steam and support the devs if not for the gameplay then do it for the awesome music that comes with. I just did, a copy for me and my friend.

Will seed during the day when my computer is on."
