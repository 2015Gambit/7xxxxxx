                     FREE  - The Stealer  (1970)



      "The Stealer" is a song by Free, featured on their 1970 album "Highway". Album was recorded extremely quickly in September 1970 following the band's success at the Isle of Wight Festival but with an attitude of relaxation, having achieved worldwide success with their previous album "Fire and Water" and the single "All Right Now". Much to the band's disappointment, the album (fourth studio album)  only reached #41 in the UK album charts (the previous album Fire and Water had reached #2) and reached only #190 in the US, not generally enough to register on chart listings. 
      The single release "The Stealer" failed in the UK also, and reached only #49 in the US. (Rodgers and Kirke would later re-record "The Stealer" with Bad Company in 1975 during the sessions for "Run with the Pack", but the track was not included on the album).
