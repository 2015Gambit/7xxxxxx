,Vigorion,2012-09-11T13:35Z,2S/93L. I'm stuck at 99.1%. Really?! Will seed as much as possible as soon as this is done. In the meantime here's a link for newly uploaded .flac version. http://thepiratebay . se/torrent/7622678/Savant_-_ISM_(2012)_FLAC
,Ectoplazm,2012-09-11T21:02Z,"I was the guy who got this torrent from being stuck at 71.9% to be stuck at 99.1% by downloading the files from a random site I found on Google and replacing the incomplete ones from this torrent.

Unfortunately there´s something wrong with my PC or my net which causes my downloads to be incomplete sometimes hence it says it´s 99.1% complete. I´ll try downlaoding it again now and hopefully that will make this torrent work for everyone"
,TheDubstepper,2012-09-12T05:03Z,"will add tracks 5 and 6 to the folder when i can, unless someone else beats me to it :P"
,TheDubstepper,2012-09-13T02:17Z,"nvm, it was too frustrating. i just took a download from somewhere else"
