Leadership in Praise and Worship: Learning From Past Mistakes
Brian S. Neumann
The world of the professional rock/pop music industry was my life and existence for
16 years. I worked in South Africa and Europe as a composer, live performer, and session
musician, and, for a time, was signed to the company Polydor Records in Hamburg, Germany.
Thankfully though, the Lord, by His grace, finally brought me to my senses and rescued me
from a situation that nearly cost me not only my temporal, but also eternal life.
From the day I gave my life to Jesus, I began intensive research into the language of
musicΓÇöfrom a musicological, physiological, psychological, and Biblical perspective. The
issue of music and worship became the focus of my study, and soon a ministry developed that
now takes me to countries around the world, where I share a Bible-centered understanding of
this vital issue.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
