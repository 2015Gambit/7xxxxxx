,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-08T22:23Z,Hey if you're gonna hate on MP4's you might as well hate on x264 too and just encode your upload with Xvid/Divx! Has all the uploaders been smoking crack lately? Why upload the same exact damn thing that everyone else is? Upload a Xvid/Divx encoded avi before the other guys and you shall be hailed as the new great savior of Doctor Who! LOL
,MP4SUX,2012-09-08T23:10Z,"Well, I did this test - released AVI versions of a show in both XVID & x264. Guess what? I got almost the exact same number of peers for each.

You'd think the purists or even those concerned with compatiblity would heavily favor XVID ... not so.

the x264 version is easier, hence first - but here goes another test ... almost there ... hold on ..."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-08T23:13Z,"I think it might also be that a lot of people on here have no clue what they are really downloading at times too, lol. You see a lot of comments claiming ""HEY THIS DONT WORK I ONLY HEAR AUDIO!"" etc etc.. Or ""HOW DO I GET THIS INTO MY VHS PLAYER?"" Haha. 

Joking on the second one. But yeah, I think a lot of people don't understand what format a file is that they're downloading even though it's clearly stated as so.. "
,MP4SUX,2012-09-09T00:20Z,"Press button ... wait ... watch show.

The internet suggests knowledge, but it certainly doesn't require it.

I've found that you can upload anything and at least thirty people will download it.

Feedback is hard to come by - everyone's shell shocked over the flame wars.

AVI x264 is much more compatible than MP4, AVI AAC less so."
,TheFreezerBox,2012-09-09T00:20Z,"Clearly not an ""AVI"" that my player can play (""Video codec not supported""). I mean, what's the point? I could just as easily have downloaded the Scene-release and converted that myself..."
,MP4SUX,2012-09-09T00:52Z,"Apologies for that, but it's impossible for me to know how compatible AVI x264 is. Many players that burp on MP4 don't seem to mind x264 in an AVI container.

So, you should look not for ""AVI"", but specifically ""XVID""."
