,NeoMegamanX,2012-09-10T04:02Z,Amazing : D thanks a lot I was about to buy this since no one had uploaded it so far :)
,manu2ca,2012-09-16T20:05Z,Why is the book missing first 12 chapters??? this was a waste
,doboner,2012-09-18T23:57Z,This rocks! Any chance of getting the solution manual? That would help so much
,catz747,2012-09-25T06:07Z,"This is just dynamics, the first 12 chapters are the separate statics textbook of which there is no pdf.

To my knowledge this is the only copy of the dynamics textbook and there is no solution manual to date. "
