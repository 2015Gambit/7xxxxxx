,gromacs,2012-09-26T06:05Z,"This looks like a promising torrent, thanks for the upload lotster. Can anyone who's downloaded it already confirm if it is working well and clean?"
,gromacs,2012-09-26T06:08Z,"Sorry for the double post...

Question: This is 3.5gb, while the Bioshock torrent from 2007 is 6gb. lotster, can you please explain where you cut back the file sizes, and what you've done to the game to get it like this? Thanks :)"
,lotster,2012-09-29T09:45Z,"gromacs, I didn't rip or cut anything, if that's what you mean.  Used 7zip to compress it using Ultra compression level.  Nothing else.  The game is 100% complete! ;-)"
