,Sneakerky,2012-09-09T17:15Z,"You da man, Yifi!  Excellent quality and in-sync throughout - and pre-release date too! How resourceful you are.  Thanks!"
,namshub,2012-09-10T02:46Z,"@wizh I was gonna flame about Brave's release date being too far in the future, since YIFY doesn't use cams, but I learned MIB3 is being released at the same time, in November. So maybe we'll see it soon!

I hope it won't be too long. Brave was awesome. I can't wait to show it to my nieces & nephews."

,kshithij,2012-09-11T14:41Z,"Who will buy Blueray disks or DVDs when YIFY rips are available at a better quality(Full HD) at a size one third of a DVD? Excellent work YIFY.

By the way, what is a 3d rip? How to watch it? I guess I'll download the other YIFY upload of the same film with a size slightly smaller than this at 1.6GB as I don't know how to play 3d movie. If anyone knows do share your knowledge."
,brazcafe2,2012-09-11T19:46Z,"Thanks for great uploads. Here in developing Asia, my only way to get some Western stuff."
,pravi_raj,2012-09-13T17:39Z,good one man
,Lorax98,2012-09-15T01:26Z,"How I play a 3D movie:

1. Put 3D movie onto USB stick. (convert from MKV to AVI if necessary)
2. Plug USB into LG 3D TV.
3. Navigate through the file system to the movie and select PLAY
4. Press 3D button on remote and select SBS.
5. Select ENTER and put on LG passive glasses. (the ones from a theater movie work too)

Your TV may be different."
,skanero,2012-09-18T16:34Z,fuck you yify
,cb8709,2012-09-18T23:00Z,Yify stop with your uploads they are horrible!!!!!
,dj-test,2012-09-27T19:31Z,Can't watch it because my stupid 800â&#x201A;Ź Philips TV won't play any 3D movies which aren't in 1920x1080 (or 1280x720)! Guys - avoid Philips like hell!
