Dyro is the latest in a long line of rising talent. The young DJ producer, just fresh out of his teens, made his debut in 2011 on Hardwells Revealed Recordings and has already garnered support from David Guetta, R3hab, Afrojack and Nicky Romero as well as scoring some big name remixes from the likes of Katy Perry. 'Sky High' showcases the Dyro electronic, high-energy, peak time wall of sound at full volume, with Amba Shepherd's vocals adding a slick commercial touch. Recently named 'The number one voice on today's dance floor' by DMC World [May 2012] the multi talented Amba Shepherd, songwriter/singer/producer, is based in Sydney, Australia and fast claiming success all over the globe with a string of notable songwriting and vocal collaborations with Porter Robinson, Lazy Rich & Hirshee, Ferry Corsten and Kevin Doherty.
