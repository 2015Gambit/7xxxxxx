Requirements: Varies with device
Overview: Ad-free version of Launcher 7.


Features:
- 1x1, 2x1 and 1x2 tiles with configurable colors
- Widgets in a tile! (provided that widget fits)
- Almost real like tile animation
- Almost real like tile re-arrange mode
- Almost real like status bar
- Animated contacts tile (supports G+ synced contacts)
- Pinnable contact-tile which animates like the real phone
- Folder tiles
- Webpage tiles
- Picture hub (use with care, it needs memory!!!!)
- Filterable application list
- Stock wp7-like colors and color selection

What's in this version:
This update should be delivered for ICS and JB devices only.
- Several 4.x fixes all around the L7
- Brand new tile adding and modification dialogs
May still have some issues, but is generally lot better in 4.x than 1.1.13.2 so I decided to do the release.
Update for older devices will come, you have not been forgotten.
