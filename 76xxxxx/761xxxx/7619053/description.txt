? WHAT IS LPCD

LPCD is the acronym and merging of to effective technologies
to accomplish two things foremost.
1. To share a standardized format (this  is important because every
computer comes shipped with a Disc Burner capable of burning CDs direct to Disc)
2. For consideration of sufficient quality higher than that of MP3 with ability to have excellent dynamic range
which is the quality that LPs lend as they have the closest frequency response to the
Master tapes as any format.
In many studies the majority of people cannot tell the difference of a 
properly mastered CD and an LP, so this is why CD is perfect for online sharing.

I use a custom proprietary system to extract as much information from the grooves
as I can, along with using Archival Quality Audio gear to digital format with
software tools such as Spark XL, Wave Editor, ClickRepair

is digitized audio files from original LP vinyl pressings - 
and then package of .aiff files you can drag and drop to master to CD format without
any reconversion)
