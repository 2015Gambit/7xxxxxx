**********************************************************************************
NOTE: this NEW torrent replaces thepiratebay.se/torrent/7545124 (Hash: 30A9D88458A5FE074EC3926D334B5E6748617F5F).

The original torrent had a damaged file set for the last episode (s02e22), and used four files for those episodes with audio commentary (see the link).

If you've already downloaded it, make sure all files have been completed, then:
- by your torrent client delete the torrent file but NOT the downloaded files;
- from the S02 folder delete:
  - any file about s02e22 (they're damaged);
  - any file whose episode number is 01, 04 or 21 AND whose name DOESN'T contain "WITH Commentary and OP" (optional);
  - any xml or txt file (they're old).
- from the "emulecollection" folder delete the file for season 2 (or everything);
- add this new torrent to the list to be downloaded IN THE SAME FOLDER.

Doing so you won't have to download all the files again, but just one episode and few small files (~265MB). At the same time you'll share the files you already downloaded to the other users wanting to download THIS new set.
Instructions tested on uTorrent.
