HQ rare uncensored promo music video from a promo DVD. ""Who's The Mack?"" is a song from AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, the debut album by rapper Ice Cube. It was released after his acrimonious split from his former group N.W.A. It was originally released on May 16, 1990. Primarily produced by Public Enemy's production team' The Bomb Squad, the album was an unexpectedly large critical and commercial success, and remains one of the defining hip hop albums of the 1990s. Over the years it has been regarded by many as a hip-hop classic.

AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted initially charted without the support of a lead single or video, although the title track would later receive a pressing, and a rare video for ""Who's the Mack?"" eventually surfaced. Regardless of very limited promotion, and airplay, the album reached gold status three months after its release, and was certified Platinum sixteen months later.
