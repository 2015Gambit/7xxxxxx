Further comments:

Correct lineage is as follows
TCD-D8 (LP Mode DAT) > 7-Pin > M-Audio 2496 etc. etc.

As of today there are no better copies available that I am aware of, but James L., the taper of these brilliant recordings, has mentioned the possibility to share a fresh new and improved transfer from his original masters in the future.
