,JeffCC,2012-09-08T18:42Z,anyone? FAKE?
,xMarkFitzx,2012-09-08T19:00Z,"Not Fake!

V: 9 - Definitely a legitimate DVD rip. 

A: Track 1: (quality: 2) Russian shit with talking in the background

    Track 2: (quality: 8) French dubbed, but quality of the track is excellent. Theatrical soundtrack and special effects sound great. 

Bottom line: If you can stand to watch it in another language (or Muted) the A/V quality is great. Otherwise its a cock-tease for an english release. "
,xMarkFitzx,2012-09-08T19:05Z,"It's a legitimate DVD rip. 

V: 8

A: 2 (for the fact that it not English track) however, the French track has excellent quality of the musical score and all sound effects. "
