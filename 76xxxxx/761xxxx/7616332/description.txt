2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Back in 2011, I thought it might be a good idea to accumulate and share any and all music with a Christian-based theme that was released during that year.  Before long, I was torrenting quite a few titles here on The Pirate Bay.  So it sort of became my goal to share 1000 albums with everyone before the end of that year.

Was it possible?  It seemed like a long shot.  And unfortunately I only got started in September.  So by late December I came short of my goal when I hit 964 titles in my 36th bundle of that year.

It was a lot of work.  True.  But anyone who knows the parable of the seed knows that not all seeds grow.  So if my efforts could truly just impact one life, it was more than worth it.

Today, in contrast to the 36 bundles and 964 titles I shared in 2011, IΓÇÖm sharing my 37th bundle and 965th title in 2012, just 35 titles shy of reaching that goal.  Suddenly sharing 1000 in 2012 seems quite possible with still two and a half months to go.

As always, please do the right thing and support the artists of those albums you sample that you wish to continue to listen to.  And thanks to everyone who has continue to support these torrents well after IΓÇÖve moved onto the next bundle.
