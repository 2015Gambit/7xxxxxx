,Weston0175,2012-09-09T19:12Z,"Hey TorrentTracts, do you happen to have anything by Glenn Kaiser?"
,Weston0175,2012-09-09T19:21Z,Or David and the Giants?
,Weston0175,2012-09-09T19:27Z,Leslie Phillips?
,Weston0175,2012-09-09T19:33Z,"Liza Bevill? Too Demanding? Sorry, just adding some suggestions."
,kbb81tn,2012-09-09T20:48Z,"Hey thanks for the torrents. Do you happen to have any discography's from Viktory or Willie ""pdub"" Moore? Future? Whether or not you're work is greatly appreciated. Stay blessed."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-09T22:47Z,"Weston0175, I think I have most of the Glenn Kaiser Band.  And I have about 1/3 to 1/2 of the David And The Giants releases.  As for Leslie Phillips, I think there's only a couple in my collection.  She later changed her name to Sam Phillips, and that has confused the heck out of me.  I don't know what is secular and what is non-secular.  I don't have any Lisa Bevill either.  But keep an eye open for Glenn Kaiser Band and David And The Giants coming soon. "
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-09T22:49Z,"Kbb81tn, Willie P-Dub Moore.  A St Louis boy.  I think he has only dropped two albums so far.  I'll torrent those for you soon.  As for Viktory, I have about 5 or 6 of those which I'll also torrent for you soon.  Who is Future?  I don't think I've ever heard of him before."

,kbb81tn,2012-09-10T00:57Z,Future is well unknown to myself as well but has featured on a couple of tracks of the more well know Christian artists. He's a rapper but hard to find because there is also a secular rapper by the same name. I haven't listened to secular music in so long I can't confirm or deny that they both my be the same person crossed over. But I don't know. I just figured I'd check with you since you have so much of the Christianuaic community.
,Phaedron,2012-09-10T09:29Z,I would love to see if you have anything from Shonlock. Thanks for the hard work!
,Weston0175,2012-09-10T14:44Z,Mark Heard and Margaret Becker?
,Weston0175,2012-09-10T15:23Z,Or Mars ILL?
,Weston0175,2012-09-10T15:27Z,Matt Brouwer? I'm just offering suggestions. 
,Weston0175,2012-09-10T15:30Z,Matt Papa.
,Yeukai,2012-09-10T16:43Z,"Thanks man.

I would be glad if you could get me erica cumbo's beauty for ashes"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T00:44Z,"Phaedron, I think ShonLock has 4 or 5 albums, and unfortunately I only have access to his latest two.  Just the same, I will torrent both for you shortly."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T00:45Z,"Lglenwoodc, I don't bother torrenting single albums.  Too much work, and they tend not to be supported for too long before they die out.  That said, I must have close to 15 DeGarmo And Key albums, including their Greatest Hits release.  I will toss together a torrent for you in the coming days ahead."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T00:47Z,"Weston0175, are you just picking performers at random, or do you actually want to add those to your collection?  I currently have about 5000 different Christian Artists in my collection which I could also randomly pick from.  But if you truly want discographies of those performers you mentioned, then it would be my honor."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T01:26Z,"Yeukai, that Erica Combo is set to only drop tomorrow.  I don't yet have it, but when I do get it, it'll be included in these 2012 bundles, someplace."
,Weston0175,2012-09-11T15:31Z,"Yes, please Torrent Tracts, those were requests that I would like to have. How big is your computer memory? It's gotta be at least 1 Tb to hold 5000 artists!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-11T16:04Z,"Weston0175, I've currently got it stretched over about 3 or 4 TB's.  Some here and some there.  And the 5000 Artists are just that, Artists.  Not Albums.  So there are obviously way more Albums than Artists.  I'm adding to the collection daily.  Problem is, lots of what I have isn't yet inventoried."
