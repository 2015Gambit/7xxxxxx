Successfully Implement High-Value Configuration Management Processes in Any Development Environment

 

As IT systems have grown increasingly complex and mission-critical, effective configuration management (CM) has become critical to an organizationΓÇÖs success. Using CM best practices, IT professionals can systematically manage change, avoiding unexpected problems introduced by changes to hardware, software, or networks. Now, todayΓÇÖs best CM practices have been gathered in one indispensable resource showing you how to implement them throughout any agile or traditional development organization.

 

Configuration Management Best Practices is practical, easy to understand and apply, and fully reflects the day-to-day realities faced by practitioners. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs thoroughly address all six ΓÇ£pillarsΓÇ¥ of CM: source code management, build engineering, environment configuration, change control, release engineering, and deployment. They demonstrate how to implement CM in ways that support software and systems development, meet compliance rules such as SOX and SAS-70, anticipate emerging standards such as IEEE/ISO 12207, and integrate with modern frameworks such as ITIL, COBIT, and CMMI. Coverage includes
