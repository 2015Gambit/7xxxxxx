Have you also got the last 2 episodes of Overland Trail: ep3 - West of Boston and ep 4 - The High Bridge?"
[V],TheExecutive,2012-09-15T07:35Z,"Yes, I have ""West of Boston"" and ""High Bridge"" as well.

Sorry but I uploaded both of those on one of the days Pirate Bay was offline.  So my friend is the only one who was able to download both after I E-mailed him the torrent files.  Since I bought the DVD set I don't save the Mp4 files.  
You're out of luck for now."
