,jkyriac,2012-09-26T19:55Z,"hey guys. i downloaded both the first torrent and this update and played from the start (i had both game and the update then i started) and i haven't had any problems until now. I reached Samael, but when he gets tired and i hit him and enter the first cinematic where you must press E (for interaction) to not get hurt he then gets buggy. Specifically he fights floating over the lava (you can tell that's not right) and when i damage him some more and enter the second cinematic, just before it's supposed to end (i think) the screen goes black and then shows Death flying in Reaper form as if i fell into the lava. What the hell gives?
After that i find myself on the battlefield opposite of the time portal and don't know what to do then?
Has anyone had this problem before? Can it be fixed? 
Someone help please, it really sucks having got this far just to give up on the game for this
Thanks a lot for reading all of this."
,jkyriac,2012-09-26T20:27Z,"Sweeeet, I fixed it myself. Hahaahah...
So I thought i should post the answer to my own problem for others experiencing this to see.
After i hit him when he was tired pressed E and then let myself fall into the lava. Then a cinematic came up showing Samael drawing telekinetically the battlefield towards him and the battle now continues normally."
