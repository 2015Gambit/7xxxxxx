,starlite2,2012-09-10T05:19Z,audio is out of sync with the video :/
,PyRoX1,2012-09-11T23:14Z,"Audio is out of sync by about 1.5 seconds.
Gunna delete this rip and find another good copy."

,bluesborn,2012-09-21T07:57Z,Good video and sound but out of sync.Easy fix.Use VLC set audio track sync at -2.200s or there about and you're good to go.
