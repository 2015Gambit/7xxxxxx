Notes: Frist opted for ADTRG LiNE but was the worst "LiNE" we ever heard
infact was shit for cam audio, perhaps learn the difference before tagging things
ADTRG Used TODE audio for most the film, and since TODE missed the end used 2
minutes ADTRG cam audio to make a complete film Anyhow video is perfect and audio
is damn good for cam so enjoy or fu*k off till retail comes
