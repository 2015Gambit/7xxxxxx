*  Added a subtitle to the game (""The Eight Pages"") to differentiate it from future versions.
*  Improved main menu and added music to it.  Also now includes links to Slender Man info and YouTube series.
*  Added different light sources (unlocked after beating the game once).
*  Added shadows (not especially noticeable except in lit areas).
*  Your jogging speed now increases gradually as more pages are collected.
*  Removed the cooldown for stamina recovery after jogging/sprinting, and reduced the stamina drain rate.  When
you start jogging/sprinting, however, it immediately deducts 5% of your stamina.  This will allow you to jog or
sprint for a much longer period of time, but makes repeated taps of the jog/sprint button cause your stamina
to drain very quickly (effectively getting rid of a former exploit).
*  The maximum distance you can see decreases as you collect more pages; this is to keep the challenge similar
for people who have fog turned off.  For the same reason, Distance Shade can no longer be turned off.
*  Added a menu option to automatically skip the intro.
*  Added a pause feature, but you can only pause if there's no static (which prevents you from pausing the game
in response to seeing the Slender Man).
*  Fixed a bug where the flashlight would try to illuminate a page on the other side of a wall.
*  Removed one of the hidden modes (it was only a matter of time, since it contained copyrighted material)."
