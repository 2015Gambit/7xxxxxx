In the empire series we saw the situation on the Tsuranii World during their invasion of Midkemia. In the Darkwar Series, we see what happens after the war has been resolved and many years have gone by. The Great One, Milamber or The Magician Pug as he is known on Midkemia and his group of magicians in the small conclave of Stardock struggle to come to grips with a deadlier foe. A foe that is the destroyers of worlds. A foe that is using the same type of rifts that brought the Tsuranii to Midkemia. A truly gripping piece of the entire saga.
