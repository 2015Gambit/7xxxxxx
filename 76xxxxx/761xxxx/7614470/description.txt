Shortly thereafter, Clowes' publisher Fantagraphics Books began publishing Duplex Planet Illustrated, a comic book featuring adaptations of Duplex Planet material drawn by a variety of alternative comics artists, including Peter Bagge, Drew Friedman, Dan Clowes, Jim Woodring, Chris Ware, and James Kochalka. Duplex Planet Illustrated ran for 15 issues, from 1993ΓÇô1995. Selections from the comic were published in a trade paperback, No More Shaves - A Duplex Planet Collection, in 2003.
