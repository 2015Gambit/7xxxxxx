,haggis_masher,2012-09-14T09:52Z,Jeirdan - thanks a lot for this. Despite some 500 duplicates this is a brilliant well-organised collection. I was very impressed by the huge amount of Luis Royo but also surprised by how few Boris Vallejo were included. I wish more torrents were of this quality.

Duplicates is unsolved problem now. At one point of view picture must lie in few different folders, yet from another, nor duplicates nor shortcuts can't be good resolve. 

I must be honest - some Authors folders was just downloaded like package (torrent or other archive) and included to this collection. Don't see anything wrong in something like that. 

About contents and everything, that is not in there: It's hardly possible to schematize all artworks of internet and have interest to everything all the time. Just my own hypertext road.

Yeah, I love good quality pictures so much. "

It's pretty old (2003) but it's still the best."
