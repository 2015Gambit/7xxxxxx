The Order of Phosphorus is an international guild of Luciferians who use Adversarial Magick to transform their lives. Luciferianism encourages a strict adherence towards the self-determined goals of the initiate as well as the discipline of magickal practice. The process of initiation is central to Adversarial Light, known as Luciferian Magick, alchemical changes within the mind and soul of the initiate, thus a state of continual self-improvement and transformation. ΓÇô Quote from ADVERSARIAL LIGHT, Magick of the Nephilim by Michael W. Ford

The Order of Phosphorus is not a church: it is an Initiatic Order that includes diabolic atheists, theistic and pantheistic Satanists.

What does The Order of Phosphorus mean?
Phosphorus, is an alternative word for the process of Black Alchemy or self-transformation by developing the mind to first think as a God (one who is accountable for the shaping of your life and destiny, thus yourself), then to act like a God (creating circumstances for productivity and self-improvement) and using techniques of Magick (using the Mind and Spirit to transform consciousness into a state of divine consciousness).
