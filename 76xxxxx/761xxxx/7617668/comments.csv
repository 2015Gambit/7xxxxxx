Second off during the first scene where the aliens drinks from the cup i hope theres his buddys on that saucer looking at him and going: you see what happens Larry...when you fuck a strager in the ass Larry?!"

Great up!"
,aradiel,2012-09-11T03:02Z,"A:10
V:8

It's 2hrs long and 700MB, so there is some pixelation, but it's pretty minimal. I watched on a 42"" screen from 3' away. Sound was fine, so no complaints. If you're on limited bandwidth, this version is fine."
,aradiel,2012-09-11T03:07Z,"@ibianpahiva The difference with a BR rip and a DVD rip is the source. The rip itself, meaning it's of lower quality than the source, is not better because it's sourced from a BR. A good DVD rip is better quality than a terrible BR rip."
,arnaiz08,2012-09-11T07:33Z,thanks a ton and pls. seed
,sahilrox,2012-09-11T10:22Z,"Thanks scene.

Thanks!!"
,sahilrox,2012-09-12T13:26Z,"Finally saw the movie and it was great. 7/10. Although some parts were unexplained, i believe that is the reason we should wait for the sequel in the future which was quite clear from the end. Thanks scene. 2hrs of epicness..."
,bartaz,2012-09-12T20:21Z,6722 seeders and i'm downloading this movie with 100kb/s lol? 
,Pmoney559,2012-09-13T01:36Z,Lol must be your internet cause im downloading at 830 kb/s
,sirpsych1,2012-09-16T00:08Z,"This is a DVDrip of similar quality to the refill one.

NOTE: for those of you who watch on a PS3, get this one, the audio syncs properly (it doesn't on the refill, at least not on the PS3)"

,You_Muppet,2012-09-18T03:22Z,"Firstly, S4A can be trusted and with quality uploads like this, I'll be sticking with him/her/them.

A & V = 8.

Second, much respect to all seeders."
,Shungbat69,2012-09-19T02:47Z,"Audio was decent when I watched it using Windows Media Player.  Then the audio sucked when I tried watching on Xbox 360.

,bloodred125,2012-09-19T08:53Z,"i dont understand the people that complain about quality for a 700MB rip. If you dont like it go buy it. Some of us dont want to use up 15GB's of bandwidth for 1 movie, PLUS 15Gb's for the download AND upload costs of about 4-6 Gb's generally comes in at more than 15Gb's of space for those big decent quality rips. Be cheaper to buy the damn thing for some people."
