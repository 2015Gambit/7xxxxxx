Sources - audio-Matine/echo....Thanks :P
          VIDEO-matine.....Thanks :P

Notes -
took the matine video.. re-encoded it... the video is very blurry and very noisy... used few filters turned out ok but not the best cam.. used echos line for a few spots as the matine line at time was very loud in a few places could not make out the voices.. so some parts of the echo line is upmixed to 6 channels... enjoy i guess

Extra notes:
should out to LOL ;)
