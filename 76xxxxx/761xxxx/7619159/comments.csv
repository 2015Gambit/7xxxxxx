,Mars2,2012-09-10T16:51Z,If this is a cam why does it say RETAIL? Why not just say cam.
,Astralia,2012-09-10T21:07Z,Exactly... Retail and Cam is two completely different things!
,Killz126,2012-09-10T22:40Z,"Awesome! Thank you! Superb quality for a dvd, even better than some bluray rips!"
,Mutegrill,2012-09-11T00:36Z,"Them dutch dikes do anything for attention, something they lacked growing up. Filling that void, a void their fathers raped empty, they lie, steal and do nothing good for the world. Unfortenately a lot of people - blind followers - do just that; follow, which mean they download without questioning. Sad, but that's the dutch in a nutshell: Disgusting..."
,tflagger997,2012-09-11T01:20Z,"""Video is perfect and audio is damn good for cam so enjoy or fu*k off till retail comes.""

Just proves the green skulls are earned by copy & pasting EVERYTHING on the internet to TPB.  This Spam has to stop..."

,IMABEASTBABY,2012-09-11T10:34Z,Why you bitches are all crying? He said it's a cam in the desciption so either you didn't read it or you couldn't because of down syndrome?
,MoviesR101,2012-09-12T10:37Z,"Yeah, but Cam and Retail are not the Same! So it labeled wrong! Maybe it is R5 or Dvdscreener?"
,farahad,2012-09-13T04:43Z,"Yeah, so why would he put ""retail"" in the title, but specify that it's not in the description.  Utter trollop. "
