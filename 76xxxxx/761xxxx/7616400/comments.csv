,halfchaos,2012-09-11T07:05Z,This is only 80 minutes. It's missing most of the 2nd half of the show.
,mumphabot,2012-09-12T05:40Z,"yeah, I see what you mean. About the last 10 minutes aren't there. But it's still a lot better than grabbing 10+ segments from the website and getting them with long garbage filenames all out of order."
