,anoXmous,2012-09-09T12:01Z,"As an alternative to ""tetralogy"", ""quartet"" is sometimes used, particularly for series of four books. The term ""quadrilogy"", basing the prefix on Latin prefix quadri- instead of the Greek prefix, and first recorded in 1865,[5] has also been used for marketing series of movies, such as the Alien series and Die Hard series
