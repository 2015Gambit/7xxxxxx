Also, could you upload the last book in the Morningstar Saga by Z.A. Recht? I can't find it anywhere on the interwebz. :/
Thanks again!"

,inthelight03,2012-09-09T18:15Z,Any chance you have recent (May 2012) to current Star Wars and Star Trek books?  All the collections on TPB are somewhat dated...
,tta64,2012-09-09T20:19Z,"hmm, what do you mean? like are they a comic books series or a rewrite or what exactly? I'm confused to as what to look for...."
,schmoopduck,2012-09-17T08:07Z,"First off, thanks for uploading this series, I've been trying to find it since my classmate lent me the first book to start off. Could I ask if you could upload the Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series when you get the chance? Thx a bunch! :D"
,tta64,2012-09-18T02:46Z,"hey schmoopduck - nice name btw,

I got the series for you, and as a bonus I found two short stories as well (one after book 4 and the other after book 5). Your welcome :D

Enjoy!
