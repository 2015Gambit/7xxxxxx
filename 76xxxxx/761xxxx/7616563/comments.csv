Got all the way to the activation but when I go to activate program I get "" Sorry, your request cannot be processed.
Error. The administrator has been notified. Please try again later. 
Program cannot be activated so it's not worth downloading.

Thanks anyway"
,beechyboy,2012-09-11T15:45Z,"Try many times to activate it but it keeps saying ""Too may activations"""

,truesam,2012-09-12T01:40Z,Hi Ching_liu I have followed you instructions but the program has a 30 day trial that counts down. my copy has 28 days left. Do you have a fix so that it will always be activated?. Thanks
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-09-12T04:32Z,"@beechyboy and @truesam
Please uninstall and try again. It works well but it is not a piece of cake, difficult to crack. Therefore you should obey the instructions strictly and should not pass any of the steps. "
,Robowarez,2012-09-12T15:10Z,why rename the Dll-files? can i just delete it and replace that with the cracked one???
,truesam,2012-09-13T02:55Z,"I have trieded this. I have followe the instuctions, it does not activate. so this is not worth installing. A waste of time."
,ace4cia,2012-09-13T11:33Z,"It's working great

Donno if activation is gonna last or not thou (will comment later if it doesn't)

Thanks Ching_Liu"
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-09-13T14:26Z,"Thanks to Robowarez for warning. I forgot to write in instructions.
""You should block internet connection of the application with your firewall"""
,tony5262,2012-09-13T17:30Z,"By FOLLOWING YUR instructions to the tee, i encountered no problems,so thanks Ching_Liu..a touch trickier than the norm but no less effective."
,sevenofninecollective,2012-09-13T20:50Z,"If anyone needs acronis true image for backup and restore without the cloud and no serials, regs, or activation; it is offered free at the western digital drive homepage."
,busted619,2012-09-14T08:02Z,I just installed and activated the program. Follow the instructions given and no issues! Thanks a lot Ching_Liu. Great Torrent!
,mariusgv,2012-09-16T10:19Z,"Thanks from Spain, it's working perfect!!! :)"
,the.count,2012-09-16T14:18Z,"Works perfectly if you follow Ching_Liu's Instructions step-by-step.

The most important thing to remember is that this app tries to phone home atleast 10 times during the whole process of installation, launching and installing the plus pack and using different protocols/ports.

So, either get a comprehensive firewall program with a strict rule set or disconnect completely from the internet until you finish all the steps in the readme file.

REMEMBER, DISCONNECT INTERNET until you finish installing, activating, launching and installing the plus pack!! 

PS: The importance of disconnecting from the internet cannot be overstated! ;)"
,the.count,2012-09-16T14:21Z,"Oh.. and yes, you HAVE TO BLOCK the app from accessing the internet by using a firewall.. 
Google for ""block program using windows firewall"" for more info."
,cOLIN.,2012-09-16T18:57Z,"One problem and I don't even know if it is a problem.. Activation and everything works great! thanks for the torrent.. I plugged into the internet and now I get an error "" The hardware ID has changed"" Any idea what this is all about.. thanks again.. "
,RebelRick,2012-09-17T07:10Z,Thanks Man! Installed and activated fine. Used Comodo Firewall to choke it's internet. I had been using version 11 for years so this will be a treat. Acronis has saved my ass many times.

,casper_1707,2012-09-18T13:10Z,"I'm using windows 8 enterprise x64. After installing the trial version, I didn't find in Acronis folder the libcrypto10.dll file. 
Therefore after copying the dll in acronis directory the activation give me the message: The activation code is invalid. 
I followed the steps described in the file several times with the same result."
,daveo76,2012-09-20T07:00Z,"I made this instructions up. Which I found it works the best with out needing to replace any files and no cracks needed

1) Disconnect internet
2) Install
3) Enter the serial key
4) Activate
5) Choose the option to activate on another pc
6) Connect Inter and go to http://www.acronis.com/activation/ to get the activation code from the installation code and follow instructions
7) Enter the activation code below the activation request code:
8) Go to it install directory and look for a file called ""license_activator.exe"" and change .exe to .bak 
That prevents the program for checking online. 
9) Launch the program and you see it full version 
10) Install Plus Pack
