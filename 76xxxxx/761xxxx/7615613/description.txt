This is the full season (6 episodes) of the 1998 British TV show "Ultraviolet", which, as you may expect, is a TV show about vampires.

It is in 320p, being an older TV show, but it is certainly watchable.

Expect British accents, and excellent cheesy British humor. :)

I would say this is more in the category of suspense/scifi/mystery.
