1. Install the license manager (License Manager) and program (Cadence SPB 16.5). Ignore and click next when a windows pops up asking for license file.

2. Copy the files in aspirinCadenceLicenseManager (i.e. pubkey.exe, pubkey, LicenseManager.cmd) to installed directory (e.g. C:CadenceLicenseManager). Run the LicenseManager.cmd.

3. Copy the files in aspirinCadenceSPB_16.5tools (i.e. pubkey.exe, pubkey, Tools.cmd) to installed directory (C:CadenceSPB_16.5tools). Run the Tools.cmd. The script may take up to several minutes to run.

4. Go to aspirinCadenceLicGen folder. Open the src.lic with a text editor (e.g. notepad). Change the "this-host" to your computer hostname, which can be identified using the following method "Start -> Run -> cmd -> ipconfig /all". Once done and saved, run the LicGen.cmd and a "license.lic" is created.

5. Open the License Server Configuration Utility (Start -> Programs -> Cadence -> License Manager -> License Server Configuration Utility). Locate the license.lic generated in Step-4 above.

6. Add a user environment variable (Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables)
   variable name : CDS_LIC_FILE
   variable value  : C:CadenceLicenseManagerlicense.dat

7. The installation as aforementioned was done on a Windows XP Pro SP3 (plus McAfee with latest antivirus definition update on 16 July 2011).

8. Done and Enjoy!

How to apply SPB 16.5.0028 hotfix

Do not apply Hotfix directly over installed directory(c:CadenceSPB_16.5) SPB will go wrong completely and it would never be restored without reinstall.

  
  1.Stop licence manager(go to Start -> Programs -> Cadence -> License Manager 
->LmTools and click on the "Stop server" button in the Start/Stop/Reread tab)
   and Stop process cdsNameServer.exe, if it exists
(point to cdsnameserver.exe click "end process" button in Windows Task Manager[ctrl+alt+del])
  
2.Rename installed directory (c:CadenceSPB_16.5) to any name(ex.c:CadenceSPB_16.5_temp)

  3.Create a new directory (c:CadenceSPB_16.5)

  4.Copy compnts.dat file (c:Cadence SPB_16.5_tempcompnts.dat) to installed directory (c:CadenceSPB_16.5_temp)

  5.Run a Hotfix(Hotfix_SPB16.50.028_wint_1of1.exe)

  6.after hotfix is completed,Copy 3 files (pubkey, pubkey.exe, Tools.cmd)from c:CadenceSPB_16.5_temptools to directory of c:CadenceSPB_16.5_temptools 

  7.Run "Tools.cmd" on the directory of installed hotfix c:CadenceSPB_16.5tools

  8.Transfer the whole contents in the c:CadenceSPB_16.5 to c:CadenceSPB_16.5_temp 

  9.Rename c:CadenceSPB_16.5 to any names or just delete this directory and restore c:CadenceSPB_16.5_temp to original name (c:CadenceSPB_16.5)

 10.Start licence manager(go to Start -> Programs -> Cadence -> License Manager 
->LmTools and click on the "Start server" button in the Start/Stop/Reread tab)

I got this information from below url and tested these steps in windows xp servicepack 3 circumstance and confirm it works very well.
