Can you please upload Live Wire (1992)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104743/

I cant find it anywhere and it was a great action film. 

Also - Edge of Honor (1991)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101797/

Corey Feldman classic that is only on pay sites."
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-09T13:05Z,"@Shaggy19: Thanks. I have old HDTV of Live Wire somewhere. There is no DVD or Blu-ray of it, so... better something than nothing. I will upload it.

Regarding Edge of Honor, only mislabeled DVDrip exists (it is in fact rather ugly Canadian DVB (TV) rip) and ugly VHS rip, both on Russian torrent sites (I googled it and found). Title wasn't released on DVD, just on VHS and could be bought on Amazon. So...

One I have, one torrent can be found."
