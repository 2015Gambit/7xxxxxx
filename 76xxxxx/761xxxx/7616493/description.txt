     Stars: Kurt Russell, Ray Liotta and Madeleine Stowe

   

    Russell is firmly on the ground yet surrounded by danger when he plays
    suburbanite Michael Carr in Unlawful Entry, a thriller that taps into fears
    about criminals hiding behind badges. Ray Liotta plays a cop who insinuates
    himself into the lives of Carr and his attractive wife (Madeleine Stowe),
    and director Jonathan Kaplan (The Accused) ramps up the tension as
    protector turns predator, imperiling those he's sworn to defend.
    Powerful suspense!
