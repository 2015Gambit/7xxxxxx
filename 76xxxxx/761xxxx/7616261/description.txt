
Whether it is the existence of aliens, the possibility of life after death,
or sightings of strange creatures, the lure of the unknown has always been
irresistible. Now, using the latest scientific techniques, this series seeks
to ascertain whether these strange occurrences, myths and startling
phenomena are merely illusions or actually real. Each episode highlights
one topic, including: Bigfoot, one of America's most-sighted-but-never-seen
beings; the Eastern State Penitentiary, one of Americas most haunted
locations; and a possible UFO Invasion on March 13, 1997 in Nevada and
Arizona.

Philadelphias Eastern State Penitentiary is said to be the one of the most
haunted places in America. Since its closing in 1971, many have reported
hearing eerie voices, weeping and tormented screams, while others have seen
shadows dart in and out of cells. Investigators use the latest technology
to search for paranormal activity. Motion sensors are rigged, night-vision
and infrared cameras positioned, acoustic triangulation systems set up,
and 3-D laser scanners offer a rare view inside.
