In his short career he already shared a DJ booth with Sidney Samson, Redfoo (LMFAO) and Eva Simons. And we can report he has been spotted in the studio with Julian Jordan, that other teen EDM star. His very first official release 'Keygen' is a superb uplifting, hard hitting, melodic progressive piece. Dance floor mayhem guaranteed!
