Great Game!  DLing now to watch the 2nd half!  :)

Are you going to UL the Pats game this week?  I like your files HQ, if not I'll grab one of the ALTs so no worries - Just Curious?

[V],rambam1776,2012-09-17T16:23Z,"If you could, would you post the Showtime program INSIDE THE NFL? Nobody seems to be doing that, and i don't have the toys to rip live TV. In fact, I would be interested in knowing exactly what process (hardware/software) you use to make such fine rips, as I have a lot of stuff i would love to transcribe. I just don't know how. Perhaps you could message me on the forum?"
