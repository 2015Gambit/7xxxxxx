,hxxq,2012-09-08T11:21Z,"many have complained regarding ur audio issue..
they never sound better, i have to pump volume 100 to hear.. "
,foxccs,2012-09-08T16:36Z,"I´ve had no problems with the audio quality of the yify´s torrents. But, I´ve seen that even when the video quality is good enough, it´s never at the same level of a 6-7 gb rip (duh). Some times it´s grainy. But always at a higher level than a dvd.
Thanks Yify for doing your marvelous job providing us with good movies an little disk space. "
,Riggs33,2012-09-08T17:13Z,"Great as always!

,Opiate42,2012-09-09T06:39Z,"@hxxq
The reason why you have low audio, is because you're using an HTiB system. Get a real center speaker or use only your TV speakers."

Great movie, just like MIB they stuck to it. If you love the first two then you will definitely love this one. Good story, funny moments, and some cool effects. Keep making them like this YIFI!  "
,elmentor,2012-09-09T09:58Z,"Amazing rip for such a small size. many thanks Yifi.
Please upload more Dirty Harry."

,Kanegasi,2012-09-10T09:59Z,fred856 sounds like a hater. Keep hating.
,zuluhead,2012-09-10T17:12Z,omg most crappy movie made since 1969 lol. badbadbad
,Sponger7,2012-09-10T20:46Z,"Looks and sounds incredible on the PS3, but about 20 minutes in I got the dreaded ""protected by cinavia"" message, cutting the audio. I fucking hate Cinavia with a passion. 

Anyways, great rip as always, they look and sound incredible on my ps3, but please be aware of the Cinavia protection everyone!!"
,bigough,2012-09-10T23:09Z,"I second the Cinavia protection.  

For those who don't know you can get around this by manually adjusting the time/date and adding a year.  This will buy you 20 or so more mins, just keep doing it.  

Another work around that I haven't tried is to disconnect your internet connection (keep only the router on).  "
,bigough,2012-09-10T23:10Z,"Oh I forgot, THANK YOU YIFY!!!!  As always you are unbelievable!!"
,sweet1969,2012-09-12T16:23Z,"GREAT RIP, BUT AUDIO IS WAAAAAAAY TOO LOW, AS WITH MOST OTHER RIPS OUT THERE!!! IT'S 2012, WHY DO PEOPLE STILL RELEASE RIPS WITH THE VOLUME SET SO LOW!?!??!  I USE MY SONY HDTV SPEAKERS AND HAVE TO CRANK IT UP TO ALMOST 90 TO GET IT LOUD ENOUGH!!!!  WHY CAN'T THIS BE CORRECTED?!?!  

I KNOW IT CAN BE CORRECTED, BECAUSE A SELECT FEW VIDS I DOWNLOAD DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM, SO I KNOW IT'S JUST THEY WAY YOU ENCODE THEM OR SOMETHING....

FIX THIS!!!  FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE!!"

,peru0219,2012-09-13T05:51Z,thanks yify can you upload the wackness
,Shadow416,2012-09-14T03:43Z,"for the ps3 users,

CINAVIA PROTECTION 20 mins into the movie. audio cuts out.

Aside from that, 10/10

Audio is low, but that is expected with YIFY downloads the audio on the 1080p is better than the 720p. 

still i only had to turn the volume on my tv up a little so i still give the v/a 10/10"
,sweet1969,2012-09-15T18:57Z,"YIFY, WHY CAN'T YOU INCREASE THE VOLUME LEVEL?!?!!  THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM!!  IS THERE A REASON YOU CAN'T FIX THIS ISSUE?!!?  YOU CLEARLY GET MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS!!  

TRY INCREASING THE VOLUME AND SEE IF YOU GET BETTER FEEDBACK, AS I DON'T SEE ANY REASON NOT TO INCREASE THE LOW VOLUME!!

THX."
,saffronsghost,2012-09-16T13:45Z,"Shut the fuck up sweet1969, you're crying about the same shit over and over...buy better speakers, and shut the fuck up and enjoy your free movies and tv and games and music...ungrateful cunt."

Thanks YIFY!

do you have October Baby yet?"
,sweet1969,2012-09-22T10:20Z,"@saffronsghost

THE AUDIO 'QUALITY' IS GREAT, JUST TOO LOW.  I GIVE ALMOST ALL OF HIS MOVIES A ""-"" NEGATIVE QUALITY FEEDBACK BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IN MOST OF THEM.

AGAIN, OTHER RIPPERS CAN MAKE THE AUDIO LOUDER, WHY CAN'T YIFY???

IS THERE A DOWNSIDE OF HAVING THE VOLUME LEVEL SET A LITTLE HIGHER??

P.S.  I HAVE A HUGE SONY TV, AND AS STATED, IT GETS LOUD AS FUCK, BUT SOME SOME MOVIES ARE STILL QUIET WHEN VOLUME AT 100%.

HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE."
