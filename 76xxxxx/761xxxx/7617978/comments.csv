,Laggy23,2012-09-10T05:47Z,Downloading now but I bet it's perfect just like everything else from eztv thanks in advance! you're awesome. Will post again when I watch it!
,KitteyMeow,2012-09-10T06:34Z,Hey their is this show called nail files can someone plz upload it?
,karmacode89,2012-09-10T06:47Z,It's password protected...
,Laggy23,2012-09-10T07:15Z,I don't understand why people post requests. This guy or girl posts so much stuff. don't make them feel bad about not having one show no one has ever heard of. Comments are for the item above it. not for requests. 
,Laggy23,2012-09-10T07:17Z,@karmacode89 I don't have it fully downloaded yet but it's just  a .mp4 file. I don't think it's password protected. I just think you're doing it wrong
,Laggy23,2012-09-10T07:19Z,"This is just an mp4 file. it's not password protected
 @karmacode89 you're doing it wrong"
,shawnaldo,2012-09-10T08:26Z,"laggy23, quit picking on poor little kittymeow. People can make requests, some uploaders do listen. She's not spamming, she's not trolling, she's being friendly. If you don't like the comment why let it bother you? Does it make you feel like a hero trying to make up rules for the comment section?  

That said, the show she's asking for sounds god damned awful. I googled it to see what it even was. ""from the makers of Jersey Shore"". Judging by her taste in shows, you're picking on preteen.

Anyways... Thanks for upload EZ!
An uploader with Weeds is a friend indeeds.
Kinda sucks this is the 2nd last episode EVER!
:'("

,gjpp,2012-09-11T03:16Z,"Well Ive never had a problem with eztv's torrents other than this one, it is ""password protected""/ a .rar file, so how bout someone try to help us out instead of call us liars."
