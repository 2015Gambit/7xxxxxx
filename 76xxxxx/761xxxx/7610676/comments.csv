Lick  the excrement out of your butt elsewhere, you useless sack of crap.  Decent people are dling this torrent you pathetic little dried up twat.  Get your mommy to change your fat saggy nappy ass."
,raenkae,2012-09-08T02:54Z,"Where are the criticism of the quran? I search for Wafa Sultan, Salman Rushdie, Ayaan Hirsi Ali among many others in the material of moman73. Brave humans that by the threats of death defying the hardline fundamentalism of islam to tell about their CRITICISM of Islam.

moman73, as an Atheist who earlier followed your information I believe you live in a bubble of ignorance, just as much as the christians you are slandering! I am for criticism, but this amount of bias disgusts me!

For the sake of balance. Give us an ""Criticism of the quran"", and then I will take you serious again!"
,masonicbro,2012-09-08T06:30Z,"What the hell is wrong with you folks bashing this guys torrent, These are books about the dead sea scrolls. If you dont want to read about them, then dont. I for one love reading about the dead sea scrolls, Especially The stuff they left out of the bible., like the Gnostic gospels.
 Plenty of torrents around that bash Islam. I dont see why your even all fired up over one particular religion, they are all the same, man made concoctions to control the masses and make a tidy profit from the suckers and fools that fall for them.
But i still love reading about all religions, makes it easier to debunk those glazed over eyed fanatical religious zealots, while they are trying to convert you to their delusional little world mindset.   "
,raenkae,2012-09-08T12:55Z,"masonicbro: I have a hard time taking this guy serious as he is clearly biased. Then I tend to question the sources of his materials. Are they biased too?

You should ALWAYS question the sources of ANY material. That is only healthy, and also shows that you are not easily fooled!"
,BCwader,2012-09-08T22:23Z,raenkae: I'm with masonicbro on this and I say that as a fellow atheist. I welcome the opportunity to read essays on The Dead Sea Scrolls and appreciate moman73's torrent for this reason.
,raenkae,2012-09-09T01:55Z,"BCwader: Good that we agree. There is a large BUT here. The one things all humans (and atheists especially) is to be critical of the sources. moman73 is doing a really lot of bible-bashing. As an atheist I myself do not come close to that amount of bible-bashing, so what is his agenda? This I question!

christophobia is as bad as islamophobia (if not even worse as the later phobia-religion have a lot of issues to deal with, and the followers of this religion tend deal with it by violence or threats of violence)

I cannot stress this enough.. ALWAYS check if the sources of the material are reliable!"
,zakimar,2012-09-09T03:22Z,The Zionist jews that support APARTHEID israel are all Satan worshipers.
,raenkae,2012-09-09T13:25Z,"zakimar: We dont want any HATERS here and I dont play your ""game""!

Cant you get it? I dont tolerate bias and missinformation from ANY side! To be one-eyed and one-sided is just hypocracy!

Congratulations! You have just won the idiot-award!"
