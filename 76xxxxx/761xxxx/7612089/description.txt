A screenplay by Sir Tom Stoppard, Benedict Cumberbatch as your leading man, the exquisitely gorgeous Rebecca Hall as his bolter wife, a supporting cast of British stars (Rufus Sewell, Miranda Richardson, Roger Allam, Rupert Everett), sex on a train, bored aristocrats, grand old ladies in hats, bone china tea sets: itΓÇÖs got Sunday night telly written all over it. So why has the BBC scheduled its new adaptation of Ford Madox FordΓÇÖs ParadeΓÇÖs End in the Friday night doghouse slot?
