Vince Everett is serving a one-year jail sentence for manslaughter. While in the
big house, his cellmate, a former country singer, introduces him to the record
business. Everett takes to it so well that he decides to become a singer when he
gets out. However, he is quickly disillusioned by the record business. But with
the help of a new friend, he decides to form his own label, and soon becomes an
overnight sensation. But when he becomes a superstar, will his desire for fame
and money cause him to forget the people who got him there?
