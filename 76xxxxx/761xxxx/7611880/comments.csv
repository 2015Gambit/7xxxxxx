Y'know, if you're just *convinced* that veg-ism is the way to go, you've got studies that support your position to uphold; the only people who'll be open to hearing the evidence 'against' veg-ism are those who've been feeling bad on that diet, or those who think logically that maybe the traditional (ancient) diet for our species isn't the essential problem for our health or our planet."

Okay, do you really know anybody who is living on an ""Ancient"" diet?    I'm not a vegetarian.  My last meal was two hot dogs and a bottle of Mountain Dew.   Objectively, I'd bet ten dollars that the average 21st century vegetarian diet is closer to what the average person ate 500 years ago than...  well, what I've been eating lately. "

Do I know of anyone with an ancient diet? Well, taking into account the evolutions and human-manipulated modifications of plants and animals over the last 500 (your mention) or 10,000 years - nothing is ever going to quite compare - then yes, I happen to know the Paleo diet is gaining adherents. Personally, I try to minimize my intake of grains & beans, and avoid added sugars in all its forms.

I just thought I'd regret the temporary joy of crap food & drink when my body's capabilities start to wane and deteriorate prematurely.

Something Lierre mentions in the book is that vegetarians, being at least conscious enough to avoid meats (and vegans being attentive to all sorts of ingredients) have taken one step toward being more healthful with diet. So if you're saying that most vegetarians are healthier than most soda-drinking, hot dog & burger-eating omnivores, I guess I'd agree.

But why would you compare a group who is attentive (at least minimally) to diet against a group who doesn't care what garbage it consumes?"
