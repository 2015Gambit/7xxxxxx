Melissa Harris-Perry; Sunday, September 2, 2012.

Melissa previewed the DNC by looking at just how the "big blue tent" is being raised -- and also, at what's in that tent.  The Republicans built their tent with one misguiding, yet quite telling phrase: "We Built That!"

MHP handled the big victories recently for voters in Ohio and other states, the sad state of health care in America, and the rampant increase in gun violence seen in cities like Chicago. Melissa also delivered a Footnote about a past DNC keynote speaker, and gave a DNC pop quiz to some of her guests.

MHP's guests included:

Cristina Beltran (associate professor of Social and Cultural Analysis, New York University), Daniel Drezner (professor of International Politics at Tufts University), Anthony Foxx, mayor of Charlotte, NC), Dr. Neal Flomenbaum (emergency physician-in-chief, at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center), Aisha Moodie-Mills (advisor to the Center of American Progress Action Fund, and director of the FIRE Initiative), Rebecca Onie (co-founder and CEO of Health Leads), Ed Pawlowski (Democratic mayor of Allentown, PA), Myrna Perez (senior counsel for the Democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice), Dr. Herb Smitherman (assistant dean of Community and Urban Health, Wayne State University School of Medicine.)
