This book is primarily a math and numbers puzzle book. There is a section called "combinatorial and topological problems", which are more visual logic. For the most part the puzzles are of medium difficulty and easily solved with pencil and paper in about 10 minutes. Once you start working your way through the book the solutions come a little easier as Dudeney's methods start to become familiar. These are satisfying puzzles, I found only a few that felt like a let down.
This is an excellent brain exercise book for kids starting to tackle algebra.
