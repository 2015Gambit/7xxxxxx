How the Universe Works Series 2
The universe is made up of wondrous statistics that detail the incredible range between large and small, near and far, and light and dark - but what any of these inexact terms really describe is still open to debate. We are surrounded by laws that govern everything - determining the colour of the stars, the gravity controlling our solar system and the beginning and end of the universe itself.




2)  Megastorms - The Winds of Creation 
Tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms, lightning and floods - for us these destructive forces are symptoms of Earth's creative energy. The weather on Earth is one of the drivers for life and even the most violent and destructive storms create new opportunities for life to flourish. In our quest to discover if we are alone in the universe, we have recently hit upon a surprising new approach - we shouldn't just look for worlds, we should look for weather. What is true of Earth could also be true of other planets throughout the whole universe. Across the immense distances of space, find chaotic weather - find that megastorm - and maybe we will find alien life.
