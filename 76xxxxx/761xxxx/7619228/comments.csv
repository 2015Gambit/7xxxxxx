,x264,2012-09-10T19:06Z,Thanks for this!
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-11T05:57Z,I figured that was a car show cuz of the name.I'll have to check it out.I hope Les does more of these but at the same time I don't wanna hear about his body being found in a jungle or an ice cave somewhere.plus I'm pretty sure he's covered just about every situation you can think of for survival
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T03:55Z,"theres a special out with him talking about his top 10

I wont bother grabbing or converting that one
but again its not part of Season 4 as listed

its a darn Special"
