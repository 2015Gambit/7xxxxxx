This book is really great. If you liked the film, you will enjoy the book.I have already seen the film and they are too similar, but here the movie made some big changes which means having seen it doesn't make the book predictable. 

If you enjoy the film, I would say the book is even better. There's even more action and suspense, and the whole book just feels so real. You really feel like you are there on the island with the characters and the dinosaurs.
