The second installment of the Shake, Rattle & Roll franchise comes in six years after the first movie premiered. This time, it is produced by Regal Films under the direction of superb directors, Peque Gallaga and Lore Reyes. Unlike the original version, the film dwells in both comedy and horror, but most comedic antics are visible in the episode Kulam.
