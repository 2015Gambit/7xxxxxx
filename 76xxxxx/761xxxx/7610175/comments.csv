And, let me know if it works...."
,mnpd,2012-09-11T03:00Z,"Don't even bother... just a vehicle for viruses.  Trojan ADH.2 and Trojan.gen.  Doubzstep, you knew exactly what you were uploading, you piece of shit.  "
,Doubzstep,2012-09-12T16:42Z,"Well thank you troll tard. But, actually, I did not. I found this on Warez-BB and then upacked it and uploaded it here. But, from what I saw, there were no ""viruses"" just false positives. Also, mnpd, at least I contribute to TPB, you have nothing.

Anyone else?"
,Doubzstep,2012-09-12T16:46Z,"Also, since it has been downloaded over 900 times as of 2012-09-12, you are the only one who says ""virus."" I must disagree with you and so does a majority of the people out there."
,BStock,2012-09-13T22:08Z,"Hey I downloaded the Mac version of photoshop... The next step says to replace the framework file in the contents folder.  I cannot find this folder. I am looking in the Adobe Photoshop CS6 folder under the applications, but there is no contents folder.  Please help!!! I need this program and cannot figure out how to get this to a full version and not a trial. "
,1dtvd,2012-09-17T05:06Z,hey does this work?
,Doubzstep,2012-09-22T23:17Z,"I personally have installed it on Windows 7 and Mountain Lion, both fully activated. So, yes this worked for me."
