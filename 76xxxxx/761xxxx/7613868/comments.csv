,trey12344,2012-09-08T23:17Z,Is this real
,lepsgnr,2012-09-08T23:27Z,"yes, it is real"
,7117,2012-09-08T23:27Z,"what you mean ''real'' ?
it's sci-fi not documental or what you thinking? cartoon?"
,Airgunner2012,2012-09-08T23:29Z,"Yes its real, seed ppl

Seed = speed!"
,Airgunner2012,2012-09-08T23:30Z,@7117 lool he means the torrent

,pyro12345,2012-09-08T23:37Z,"A/V? anyone?
is it an R5 or a CAM? title is both?"
,analogreflections,2012-09-08T23:40Z,why someone don't use that dvdrip with cam audio? that resolution is way better than this one
,musclestud1,2012-09-08T23:42Z,"hell, it's for real. but we want TS sound.  DVD will be out in Oct."
,simon200,2012-09-08T23:46Z,Cheers dude
,jmystro,2012-09-08T23:50Z,muxing a better copy now and will up soon...hope's audio is SHIT
,lepsgnr,2012-09-09T00:05Z,"V=7
A=3 (crappy with low volume) idk if its out of sync, didnt watch much"
,simon200,2012-09-09T00:19Z,"Yeah way oos
Cheers for the effort"
,MIAMIRON9,2012-09-09T00:25Z,"the scull use to mean something decent...not anymore

terrible audio"
,jickle13,2012-09-09T03:30Z,"@MIAMORON9 green skull doesn't mean 1080p you fuck head, it means you can trust what it says it is...R5.CAM-AUDIO.   some people's kids...dropped maybe?"
,piranical,2012-09-09T04:48Z,"100% agree with jickle13. well said, fucking biggest cry babies on here haven't shared squat. the least they could do is show some appreciation. scene4all pumps em out here constantly and anyone on here more than 5 seconds knows that he ups the best available consistently. if it wasn't for these guys there would be no tpb. v7.5 with cam 5.5 audio is still better than any other english version right now. cheers.."

,xcfzm94,2012-09-09T07:01Z,"audio isnt that bad watchable, and audio is easily synced with vlc track hastening, i did it with -3 sometimes it needs adjustments but -3 seems to do it pretty well "

,pyro12345,2012-09-09T07:14Z,"after having watched the whole movie i just wanted to say FUCK YOU to the director in hopes that he somehow reads this...totally ruined the movie at the end...""spoiler alert""...alien vs. predator rip off!"
,SomeGuy1999,2012-09-09T10:24Z,"Downloading the link Yerisan posted, will let u know "
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-09T11:34Z,"pyro you fucktard,this was made buy the same guy that made the first Alien movie.AvP is the rip-off dumb ass.....with that being said he should have went back & watched his original work,then maybe he wouldn't have fucked up his own story so bad.inconsistent to say the least.thnx for the up anyway S4A,+1"
,SomeGuy1999,2012-09-09T11:46Z,"The pisted links from the other torrent side do have english audio, quality is not dvd rip audio but pretty good

,agoss70,2012-09-09T12:45Z,"A 3 (out of sync)
V 6"
,exel57,2012-09-09T23:02Z,"excellent video, but badly out of sync!!!"
,Magg216,2012-09-10T06:24Z,"I'm not sure how I feel about the movie overall but I'll tell you about the quality. The video wasn't bad, maybe 7.5-8/10. It could have been a little sharper but there were no parts I can remember where I just couldn't tell what I was looking at. There was also a few minor cuts where a second or two would repeat itself. The audio.. oh, the audio. I could hear it just fine, no problems there. But it was terribly out of sync. That would have been alright as I can just adjust the sync on VLC, but it kept jumping around so I would have to re-adjust the sync every now and then. I'd say it gets the job done if you want to see the movie right now, otherwise just wait for a true dvdrip. "
,Magg216,2012-09-10T06:26Z,"Oh, thanks for the upload though. It is a lot better than a lot of the other stuff I tried downloading. I'm glad I finally got to watch it. "
