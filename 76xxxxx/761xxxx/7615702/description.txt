Synopsis:
Fareeda MehtaΓÇÖs debut film Kali Salwaar (The Black Garment, 2002) tries to approach major themes in a more philosophical way. Centred on a Muslim prostitute coming from Muzzafarpur to Mumbai, Kali Salwaar is an almost abstract odyssey into migration, marginalization, and displacement. Fareeda, who was trained by Kumar Sahani, is an admirer of Ghatak and the French cinematographer Bresson, and follows in the footsteps of the famous cinematographer Ritwik Ghatak, who used cinema forsocial criticism as much as for contemplation and dialogue, like his students Kumar and Mani Kaul. Her film is based on a story by Saadat Hasan Manto, the leftist Urdu short storywriter of the nineteenth century.

Plot:
Sultana, a small town prostitute migrates to the big city - Mumbai. The film Kali Salwaar unfolds in the down town and back streets of Mumbai where destinies are constantly being transacted along with glances, favours and money.
