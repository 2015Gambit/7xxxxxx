[T],footy,2012-09-09T19:56Z,"After seeing this race, Check out TheMinisHD, a youtube channel where all the F1 races are shown as funny characters. These videos are amazing.

This is not my channel, i am just recommending it for fellow F1 fans, Cheers."

,googaloop,2012-09-09T20:35Z,"This race made me happy in many ways! The local provider where I live is broadcast from Singapore and it really doesn't compare. All the actual video is identical because its from Bernie, but the commentary is much more interesting with proper racing Brits running the show. I sat in a cafe to watch the (pseudo HD) StarSports broadcast earlier at a local diner, and I met a lovely old couple from Australia. 
Turned out that husband, in his mid-70's, was a part of Formula 1 in his early years. He used to help Mr. McLaren build some of their earliest formula 1 race-cars and was a close friend of Sterling Moss, Niki Lauda, and then some. It certainly made this race personally memorable.  I am so tickled that I just had to comment about it. Tip for anyone- always be friendly and polite because you never know just who you are talking to... Last year a similar event occurred when the gentleman sitting next to me during the race Vettel scored enough to ensure his championship title, he turned out to be Seb's best friend's father.  I am not gullible nor am I a liar or braggart. I simply am social and living in an international holiday destination."
