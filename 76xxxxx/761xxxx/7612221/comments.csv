,gacgirl,2012-09-08T11:16Z,Thank you for this. You and everyone else trying to keep avi's alive for us who need it. My computer just will not play anything else. (it's really old) Thank you again.

,journey1956,2012-09-08T19:42Z,@ gacgirl... All you have to do is install K-Lite Mega Codec Pack  9.2.0 and your computer will be able to play anything. There are other types of codec packs out there too if this one isn't for you and they are all free.
