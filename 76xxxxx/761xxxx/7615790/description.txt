Plot
   After breaking out of a moon-based maximum security prison, Boris the Animal 
decides to go back in time and eliminate the person who arrested him - Agent K. 
When he does so, Agent J realizes that the time line has been changed and he too 
travels back to July 15, 1969, the day before Agent K is killed. After 
overcoming some disbelief, J manages to convince K and others of just who he is 
and why he's there. With the help of a being who can see all time lines, they 
track Boris down. J also learns a secret, something K had never told him.
