,gdog799,2012-09-13T05:00Z,"Worked great. Here is what i did

1. download this file
2. use Free ISO Burner to burn this to a disc. I used a dvd+r
3. restart your computer and tap F2 so that it will take you into the BIOS
4. go to the boot section and set it to boot from the cd/dvd drive. save and exit
5. it will restart again and since it is booting from the cd/dvd drive now, it will tell you to press any key to boot from the cd/dvd, otherwise it will skip it and boot from the hard drive as usual
6. press a key when it asks you to and it will start the installation
7. during the installation, the computer will restart a few times. When it restarts, it will ask you again ""press any key to boot from cd/dvd"". DO NOT press the any key again, because the installation is already in progress 

thats what i did and it worked for me. Dont forget to back up all important data before you beigin"
