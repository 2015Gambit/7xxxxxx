'Drought Chic'

Self-published by the Writer and Artist - Shary Flenniken, 1977

Fifty pages about the late 70s drought and subsequent water shortage as well as the class differences associated with its effects. It's actually pretty humorous most of the time.

Shary Flenniken (born 1950) is an American editor-writer-illustrator and underground cartoonist. After joining the burgeoning underground comics movement in the early 1970s, she became a prominent contributor to National Lampoon and was one of the editors of the magazine for two years. Her best-known creation is Trots and Bonnie, a light-hearted satire of the adult world through the eyes of a precocious girl and her talking dog.

Part of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader you should actually shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.

After it was pointed out to me that people were getting a GonVisor popup, I am now creating these books in such a way as to have stopped that from happening. No GonVisor popup will appear on any 'Restorations' in the future.

I have almost 1500 Underground comic books in a digital format. I will be restoring and uploading many of my favorites over the coming months. Any requests, just say the word.

So what does 'Restored' mean? Well with all due respect to the great and wonderful Sir Real (if you know the name, you know his power!) and all the other scanners who have shared these books with the online world, the pages of these books were not yellow when first printed. Newsprint? Yes, often they were. Cheap paper? Yeah, that too. But not yellow.

In most cases, the changes make the books look better than they did when they were originally printed. By turning the newsprint or cheap paper they were printed on to a bright white, with crisp, clear greys and solid blacks on top, they look very much like a new b&w comic you would buy right off the shelf today.

This is accomplished by running the b&w pages through the PhotoScape Batch Editor. The Filters applied to the pages are; Grayscale (changes the image to greyscale); a 'Middle' of 'High' setting on Auto Level (greatly improves the blacks); a 'Low' or +1 Sharpen (barely noticeable, even if you watch the changes take place); 'Deepen' is used if there is bleed through from the image on the back of the page or to improve the overall look or color or b&w pages. Occasionally 'Brighten' or 'Darken' are used if needed. Single page restorations are done as needed when the finished product is below expectations. Color covers, back or interior pages are 'Restored' on a page by page basis.
