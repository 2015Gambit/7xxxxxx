Plot:
The Government of India has chosen to present a literary award to Divakar Barve in recognition of his contribution to Indian Arts and Cinema. Divakar accepts this award, and the community decides to recognize this award-recipient at a special party just for him. Several big-wigs in Bombay city are invited, and they include Mohini, the alcoholic and aging wife of Divakar; Ravi an actor; Bharat an aspiring actor and poet; An aging Ruth who is always accompanied by a much younger boyfriend; Poet and producer, Agashe; Ila Arun the singer; and Achyut Potdar a Bollywood actor. Everyone awaits the arrival of Amrit, an activist. What the invitees do not know that the party is going to be gate-crashed by the host's, Mrs. Damyanti Rane's son and his teen-aged friend; a couple, Naren and Malvika; Then something unexpected happens: Amrit does arrive - but not in the way everybody expected him to arrive. 

Overview:
Shot in real-time, lasting most of an evening, except for a few initial scenes to set the context ΓÇö which show the people who attend just before going to the party: getting ready, looking forward to going, or cribbing about having to go ΓÇö and a harrowing finale.
The film is a deeply intelligent satire aimed at the urban elite ΓÇö especially those poseurs with artistic inclinations, namely establishment-artists and their patrons. It depicts their apathy towards the society at large while they get away, by the way of small talk and prosaic conversations at parties.
The power of the movie derives from Elkunchwar's play ΓÇö which had a very successful run in Marathi theatres in Pune and Mumbai, before Govind Nihalani turned it, with the author's active participation, into a screenplay.
