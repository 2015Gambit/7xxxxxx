Synopsis:-

It is time for the 4th Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City to begin and the Einzbern family is determined to achieve success after 3 successive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the magus killer, Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks despite his reputation as a skilled mercenary who will do anything to accomplish his goals.
However, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family - his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya - and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail.
Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest who cannot find any sense of fulfillment in his life and sets his sights on Kiritsugu as the possible answer to the emptiness he feels.
