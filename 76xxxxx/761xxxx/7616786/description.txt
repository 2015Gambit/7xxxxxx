Derrick Harriott~Rock Steady Party (Trojan) [FLAC} {MKOP}

Deadly Derrick played a foundation role in reggae music from late ska through to the heavy manners of the mid seventies heyday, and is often much overlooked and unfairly underrated. Matching his own vocals up with the horns delights of Bobby Ellis, two awesome timeless cuts from Keith and Tex "leaving on that train" and ''tonight'' provide the centrepiece of the original for me, but wait  a minute, there's further cheering delights, extra pieces from David Anthony, Lyn Taitt, a soulful jewel from Lloyd and Glen ''that girl'', and eight full bonus cuts. Four more funking pearlers from Bobby Ellis, an early Glen Brown with Lloyd Robinson, Derrick's own ''Solomon'', Keith and Tex again taking on ''Stop that train'' - winner package, rocksteady delights!~boomkat
