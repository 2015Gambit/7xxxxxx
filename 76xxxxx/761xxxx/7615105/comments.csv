now for the rest of you whiners- you guys are all dizzy cunts. first off, an R5 IS a dvd rip, just not R1 quality. second- it says in the info that audio was NOT from the same source as the video(thats a clue to it being CAM audio). third- who the fuck has the right to complain about free shit(starving africans would love to watch this in ANY capacity). fourth- if you dont know how this ""torrenting"" thing works, maybe you should learn(they have this new invention called reading). and finally- dont hate on the people that bring the goods cause maybe one day those goods will be gone.

,MegansDad,2012-09-09T21:33Z,"I have to go with everyone else on this one.  I never saw it in the theater so I can't comment on how it looks compared to that but video wise I thought it was good.  Audio is a completely different story. Up until 2:44 the audio was fine.  But at around 2:45 it goes silent for a fraction of a second and picks up with what is definitely a different audio track.  The new track sounds hollow, almost as if it was recorded with a microphone placed next to a speaker.  So, I'd say Video of 8 but an Audio of 3 or 4.  If we can get a copy with audio that matches the quality of the first 2 minutes it would put the Audio up to an 8 or so as well."

It's an identical rip to the others - Russian R5 / DVD quality with Audio that was taken in part (most of it) from the Cam version and sync'ed up.

Personally, as i saw it in the theatre, im happy to wait for a better copy or even to buy it on Blu ray when it comes out, but for those who may want to watch it with crappy sound, they can, that's why it was uploaded."

R5 means REGION 5.  IT IS A DVD FROM RUSSIA.
The video rip is from the DVD, the audio is from an English speaking source.  

Stop being so friggin stupid, internets!  I barely download shit from here but at least I know the definition of the things I download.

BTW - Thanks HeroMaster!  I might watch this, I might wait for better audio, but regardless; I, and the majority of the other pirates, appreciate your effort.

If by that you mean the final cherry on a shit sundae of a once great movie franchise.  Then ya, great, great movie.

Bad, plot, horrible writing, shit acting, unlikable characters. This movie really couldnt have been much worse imo."

Thanks for sharing your insight. When I first downloaded I had a serious WTF moment when it came to the audio and your comments actually showed the OP put some considerate effort into providing a DVD video with audio us ""dumb americans"" could understand.

Cut us a bit of slack. We assumed a DVD rip meant a true DVD rip. Your clarification makes me respect the submission a bit more for the work put into for us for a good video rip, however, your delivery was a bit harsh."

Audio sounds like it was recorded in mud underwater during a hurricane.  Virtually impossible to follow the dialog without heavy filtering, which my media player could not do  There was one small patch, about 3/4 through, where the audio was clear for about 7 minutes then it reverted back to mud!  

As for the movie, so so!  The screenplay was poorly conceived.  No clear reasons were offered how this journey halfway across the universe got authorized.  There was absolutely no character development.  No reason whatsoever for most of the characters to even be there! Worst of all, the central plot lines were stolen entirely from ALIEN.  Nothing new was offered in this movie.  Still, the twist at the end is intriguing enough to suffer through the rest of it.

Bottom line - wait for a copy with decent audio."

,Gargrevar001,2012-09-10T11:30Z,"Not watchable with the tinny, noisy audio that sounds like a bad cam copy.

As for the film, although it was called a prequel by Scott, it is only so in the flimsiest of senses. It has nothing to do wit any other Aliein film or franchise at all as quoted by Scott: ""The film will be a prequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film Alien; however, the events of the film will not precede any of the previously established characters or story lines from the Alien franchise"".

It really should be called a reboot as the best way to look at this, overrated film in my opinion, is to not even think about the Alien franchise as anything to do with it at all. Which of course it hasn't."

It explains where the aliens come from and how they got on that planet, and where that freaky alien ship came from, and who the dead alien pilot was in that chair...

So how can it explain all of that stuff in Alien and still be said it has NOTHING to do with Alien?

This is an AWESOME movie.  There are a couple of minor flaws, but most movies have them.

Thanks to the uploader but I'm waiting for a HD copy of this movie."
