Summit Meetings: Metronome All Stars & Esquire All Stars 1939-1950 (Fremeaux & Associes) [FLAC] {MKOP}

From 1939-51, the American magazines Metronome and Esquire asked their readers and critics to vote for their favorite jazzmen. The winners were invited to cut a few discs to mark the occasion, and almost all of these recordings have been reunited in this set. Though this was the period of wars first heated, then cold, it was as if the artists were totally unaware of these events.
