The winner of GameSpot and IGN's racing game of the year award for the previously released PlayStation2 computer entertainment system version, Burnout 2: Point of Impact builds upon this strong speed-driven franchise with improved gameplay, new game options and bigger, better and more insane crashes. Burnout 2: Point of Impact is infused with a wealth of new features and improvements, including bigger tracks, fully tuned-up custom motors, secret challenges, all-new modes of play, and an improved Burnout meter. Players can test their nerves and skills by taking to the air, sliding through corners, and swerving to avoid head-on collisions, while filling their meter to unleash a burst of speed previously exclusive to airplanes.
