** technical note - you'll notice after you unzip the package
the files may or may not have extension. If it does you'll see .aiff or .aif
this file format is the professional standard file format for mastering to
CD REDBOOK. It's basically equivilant to .wav on windows.
Windows will handle it, sometimes you have to choose it manually
in your favorite audio playback system. Windows will usually not
natively automatically recognize it, as reported.

NFO :


A really nice compilation (taken from around 90 dates in a year)
of Live material from Neil Young.
Still not officially released on Digital format.
Here is the Canadian 1st Pressing.
Incidentally this was an early Digital/Analogue hybrid recording.

Some of the material on this is my favorite Young material
and he really hits a resonance with deeper feelings
on this Album, especially with childhood memories
and the self directed goal of not to give up!

If you do not know what AIFF is, it is similar to WAV.
Every modern player and converter handles AIFF.
By Default every CD burner handles it.

EFFECTS-NOISE SHAPING-REDUX

Recorded flat-

If needed, Declick applied with CLICKREPAIR 

I will never try to remove V.C.N. Vinyl Continuous
Noise (the light constant crackle hiss which is also
in alot of cases the hiss of the master tape), as this also effects
the sound of the music in almost all cases if one tries to remove.

NO Compression/Limiting
