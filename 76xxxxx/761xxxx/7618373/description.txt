Killing Bin Laden - For the first time, a first-hand account of the raid that killed the world's most wanted terrorist from one of the Navy SEALs who pulled the trigger. Scott Pelley interviews "Mark Owen," a former SEAL who was in the room when Osama bin Laden died from American bullets, in an exclusive interview. "Owen," a pseudonym he uses for security, recalls each step of the mission and the preparation he and the nation's elite force made for it in order to give credit to his SEAL comrades and the hundreds of others whose work played a role in the successful mission. This historic account will be in four parts and will comprise the whole hour. Henry Schuster is the producer.
