,raindr0ps,2012-09-09T20:47Z,RAR's really suck and there's really no need for them. 
,shamanist,2012-09-09T22:26Z,"@raindrops---while it could be argued that 7zip might be a better choice than winrar, compressed files actually do serve many purposes. This is a prim example: putting a bunch of files together for one SIMPLE download. Also, if the person has slow speeds for uploading, a compressed collection may prove more practical than uploading a bunch of files. It pays to think these things through before whining..."
