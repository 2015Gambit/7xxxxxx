#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

In the town of Ada, Oklahoma, Ron Williamson was going to be the next Mickey Mantle. But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from RonΓÇÖs home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to deathΓÇöin a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a manΓÇÖs already broken life, and let a true killer go free.

Impeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, John GrishamΓÇÖs first work of nonfiction reads like a page-turning legal thriller. It is a book that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocenceΓÇöa book no American can afford to miss.
