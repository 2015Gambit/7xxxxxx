Synopsis - Near the end of World War II, 14-year-old Michiel becomes involved with the Resistance 
after coming to the aid of a wounded British soldier. With the conflict coming to an end, 
Michiel comes of age and learns of the stark difference between adventure fantasy 
and the ugly realities of war.

The only source I could find for this movie was an over compressed BBRip. I manaaged
to clean it up and make it a cinematic 480p. I made this out of necessity. It's a really good movie, 
and I wanted it in my collection. I figured I can't be the only person out there that hates how the 
SRT files don't get picked up when streaming through your home.
