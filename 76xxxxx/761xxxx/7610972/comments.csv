,Zo0by222,2012-09-08T01:23Z,Is this the Full version ? only 6 gig ? not suppose to be 8.14G ? 
,bdg90,2012-09-08T01:57Z,why is it only 6.73 g ?
,AXSC,2012-09-08T02:54Z,SEED!!!!!!!
,SteelerJ17,2012-09-08T03:08Z,I hope this game doesn't suck like Madden 13. 
,P_Greezy,2012-09-08T03:43Z,"Ahhh dats what i like to see new ppl on the come up, yall should give boobsman a rest and support the others trying to share free products on early release, Thanks so much for this, just wanted to know if i need the lattest 15574 dashboard for this game to work?"
,AXSC,2012-09-08T04:52Z,Guys. Everyone's stuck at 59.9! Need people to seed!
,neto2014,2012-09-08T05:16Z,it's region free?
,neto2014,2012-09-08T05:30Z,its region free?
,dmarz45,2012-09-08T06:49Z,Guys I'm BEGGING you. PLEASE seed once your finished downloading and don't just delete the torrent. Be a team player!!! 
,Fuqthegovt,2012-09-08T07:07Z,Yes this is region free. Not sure about the 15574 req (xkey and dash already updated so can't test on lower). Tekken Tag Tournament 2 definitely requires it's so reasonable to assume this does too.
,P_Greezy,2012-09-08T16:44Z,"Its confirmed that its still has the 14719 dashboard required to play for anyone that was wondering, its a legitmate copy of the game and working on lt 3.0."
,Zo0by222,2012-09-09T04:35Z,"what is a legitmate copy ??? not suppose to be 8.14G ? Only 6 

Is it the full game ? "
,ironster,2012-09-09T05:37Z,"To answer why the file is so small...first of all it is compressed with winrar, second the Iso itself seems to be the size of the xdg2 discs rather than the larger xdg3 discs."
,Offe_Hv,2012-09-09T13:41Z,"This dosen´t work for me, I was easy to burn the game but when i start it and going to play a game the game just fries my X-box ?

How do you make it work ? "
,Offe_Hv,2012-09-09T13:44Z,"Hey, This dosen´t work for me. It was easy to burn the game but when i going to start a match the crash. And i most start over my x-box ? How to you burn it so it works ?

I used img burn to burn it"
,killerle,2012-09-09T17:02Z,thanks alot! works like a charm! burnt with imgburn on verbatim-discs. have lt 3.0. have even played online without any problems :)
,AXSC,2012-09-10T03:40Z,Works great! Do you think you'll be getting NBA 2k13 early too?

Did i still use the XGD3 method to burn it ? Calculate Optimal for the sectors ? "
,jankula,2012-09-10T10:44Z,"Tnx  A LOt Mr. Thenoobish!
It`s XGD2 protection so its less size
catch .dvd file with and burn via imgburn,so the speed is set automaticly,and working like a charm(Do NOT run through abgx360)

P.S. the Best NHL game ever!




"
,ironster,2012-09-11T00:31Z,No zoo you burn it with the xdg2 layer break google it
,Zo0by222,2012-09-11T05:06Z,"i have burned the game with the same method for the XGD3 discs.. Work like a charm

DO NOT UPDATE THE DVD FILE, DONT PASS IT IN ABGX360"
,otterscanner,2012-09-11T09:34Z,Är det xgd2 skydd på denna så man kan spela med lt+ 2.0?
,otterscanner,2012-09-11T10:17Z,Is this xgd2 so you can play with LT 2.0?
,rooova,2012-09-11T10:24Z,"I can't get it to work?? My Xk3y does not launch the game thru my USB harddrive? why?
"
,blakebonkofsky,2012-09-12T06:56Z,"Why are you retards saying NOT to run through ABGX? It clears ABGX just fine. The DVD file is set correctly, and doesn't get changed. You don't NEED to run it through ABGX, as it's already patched and verified, but it doesn't hurt."
,emsoo,2012-09-12T10:58Z,how install this game. Please help. im tried install in deamon tools lite and secend variant is as extract winrar folders. what need to do? plese write quikly. thanks

,Gulumulu,2012-09-16T18:09Z,When I want to play the game it gives me this update request and it disconnects me from xbox live. Is it safe do download that update? :D Thanks
,killerle,2012-09-16T22:18Z,"Hello! Thanks for the upload again. My game works, but I have a problem... When I play EASHL-games/drop in (live), I have this problem where the game is lagging constantly. It's not that its slow/takes time to perform actions, when i press the buttons I'm talking about. It's constantly ""hacking"" everyother second. I dont have this problem when I play ""original"" VS-matches online or offline. Have tried reinstalling the game on harddrive and played without the game installed. didnt have this problem on nhl 12.. Anyone got a solution? Anyone experienced the same??"
,thetravis,2012-09-17T06:58Z,"The dude who ask Xk3y's recognition problem.., 

Please update your xk3y to 1.26. no problem to recognize iso file.

But, in my case.. Region code problem happens.
It is not a RF, especially NTSC-J..

I guess it is PAL, NTSC-U.."
