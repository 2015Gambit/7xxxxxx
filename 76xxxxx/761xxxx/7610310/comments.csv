1)Electrodroid Pro
2)Everycircuit

Both are electronic applications. Thank you for all your hard work. I appreciate it alot."

You are sure that it is only for 32bit systems?I have tried it in xp,vista,7 32bit and it work fine.But i downloaded as 32bit+64bit work.Can you try the compatibility mode?Or run it as admininstrator in windows 7?
