Microsoft (c) Windows 8 Pro + Enterprise Activator v1 4

We know that the old CMD
method using Admin Privileges is still working but most probably at this time you will be getting an error caused by the activation server that has already restricted the leaked serial numbers , so we strongly recommend you to use our activators and keep your fingers crossed for further releases. Cheers.

Activates Windows 8 via KMS activation. Activation lasts for 180 days, after 180 days simply run the program again



Features:
- Serial insertion
- KMS Server Selection
- KMS Activating
- KMS Background activating (Constantly looks for and tries servers for activation)
- Metro inspired UI
- Language Pack Installing
- Windows Rearm (Works on 7 as well)


What to do if it doesn't work ?

- Be patient. Do not take drugs 
- Make sure you ran it as Administrator (Right Click 'Run As Administrator')
- The KMS server might be down, more servers will be included in future releases
- Make sure you have the proper KMS key that you need installed, more keys and auto OS detection will be added in future releases
- Getting error saying something about non-core, you're inserting a key not for your version
- If you have any other issues, post below 
Note* if this version doesnt work, be sure to set the date/time/time zone correctly.. Smile
and try again (and also try with v.1.1 also)
