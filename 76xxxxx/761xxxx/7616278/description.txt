Blu-ray Demux - Lossless Wavepack 24bit 48k


Original 24bit 48K Uncompressed PCM only

All PCM data has been extracted including bonus tracks.

No lossy tracks have been extracted.


*The DVD only had AC3, this Blu-ray has beautifull PCM!



Part 1 and 2 are single file because this is how the data is stored on the Blu-ray.

Bonus tracks are multi files because this is how the data is stored on the Blu-ray.

I have done my best to do a 1:1 extract.  No data modification has been made beside a small
1 sec fade out at total end of part 2 in the final cheers and cut the end credit music which is
not part of the show but was added during authoring.

All cuesheets made manually.


Process:

Blu-ray -> tsMuxer
SoundForge -> cut final credit
SoundForge -> 1 sec fade out in final cheers
Wavepack -> wavepack -hh -x3  ( best lossless compression )
Notepad -> Manual cuesheet creation with track names and auspicious track positions
