No matter how much time passes, there are still nubs like George above, who still comically think that their problem, will invariably be EVERYONES problem.  You know, the dolts who have some simple problem and/or incompatibility which is usually avoided by those who know what they are doing, but they firmly and absolutely believe that, wait for it, everyone has the exact same system they have, and the same level of computer skills they do. Therefore ""everyone will get an error"". Really? Everyone, huh? Please, tell us about the food which gives you heartburn, so all of us can avoid that too.

How many decades have people like this ignored common sense and rational thought? And guess what? There are plenty more where they came from.

So, back to the point, does someone who isn't a complete and absolute noob have any real info about this AviaRa version?"

to /src/System/IAmAlive_game.exe
Tested on Win7 64bit."
