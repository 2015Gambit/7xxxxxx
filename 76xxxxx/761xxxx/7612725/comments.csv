,makasif,2012-09-08T19:44Z,hey bobiras can u upload the checking compatability off apk for nba jam pls becuse while running the apk it says ur device is not compatible with this game pls.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-08T20:18Z,"@makasif
I told you before this.You must change your device name to htc desire hd.Must edit the build.prop and then all gameloft games will work."
,makasif,2012-09-08T22:04Z,for that i have to root my device but i have't rooted yet.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-08T22:19Z,"@makasif 

You must root it.There is no other way to play gameloft games in non compatibility devices."
,pd4x,2012-09-09T11:12Z,"Hi bobiras2009,

thanks for the awesome work but I am having issues running on Samsung Galaxy s3 i9300 (running ICS 4.0.4). I followed all your instructions but when I launch it says ""checking license"" and the an error message ""application...stopped unexpectedly"" and then the whole thing keeps repeating in a loop. Please advise how to get it working. 

Many thanks :)"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-09T12:08Z,"@pd4x

Ups sorry my friend maybe i forget to write for this step:

Launch the Game,1st time you need connect to internet to check license.Then you can play offline it will FC once,then everything will be great!


Please do that and let me know if it plays fine now."
,jworks10,2012-09-09T14:01Z,Thanks again man. I had this on my phone and deleted it and could never find a version that worked again...thanks for the up~
,saferark,2012-09-09T15:34Z,"hey bobiras i followed ur instruction on dark knight rises v1.1.1 and other games u made, but it stay on black screen in my s3.. help me pls"

,danman91,2012-09-12T17:00Z,"hey bobiras.. apologies for being a total noob in this.. but ur title says ""100% Working No Root"" while one of the installation steps say to use the titanium backup which is FOR Rooted devices (if I'm not mistaken).. could u be so kind to clear the confusion?? Will this game work on my NON-rooted android?"
,danman91,2012-09-12T17:08Z,"never mind.. I found the link to your other non-root apk.. I'm gonna try that.. post if it works or not.
also, via this method, do I still need to connect with wifi for first run? for that license issue??"
,danman91,2012-09-12T17:24Z,"lol.. I really am a noob!
sorry I just speculated from the prior comment. The actual instructions text file is pretty simple.. will try and post if works.. :)"
,danman91,2012-09-12T17:26Z,something wrong with TPB comments editor?? my comments aren't being displayed..
,danman91,2012-09-13T09:31Z,works just fine!! thanx for an AWESOME upload Bobiras!! :)
,deadsniper,2012-09-13T17:46Z,"I copied the com.gameloft.... in its specified folder, but WHERE do i put the .apk file so the installation can start, because wherever i put it, it is telling me (PARSE ERROR, there is a problem parsing the package). A little help please"
,deadsniper,2012-09-13T23:41Z,never mind i sorted out. Great upload by the way
,srinumad,2012-09-14T16:24Z,"This the best ASPHALT 7 with sd data has worked fine for me on android v4.0.4 with out connecting to wifi for license check, Just follow the instruction in it.. Nice game. Thank u very much bobi for ur great upload.."
,pd4x,2012-09-16T08:59Z,Thanks a lot...it works great
,CreamyDreams,2012-09-17T03:13Z,"I can't for the life of me get this to work. I install the .apk, then move the data the SD Card/Internal Storage. But every time I run it, it just force closes me back to the homescreen."
,sufiblade,2012-09-18T18:46Z,"Well, the comment thread is really confusing. The description you've given says ""This version doesnt need root and work in all Android devices + Tablets"", and in the comments you're asking to change device name or install Titanium. I have an unrooted ASUS TF101, and followed the simple instructions that came with this game but after doing the license check, the game simply closes."
,sufiblade,2012-09-18T19:42Z,"Woohoo! So I tried all the simple steps again and it WORKED! 
Asus TF101 with ICS, and no Root"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-20T19:42Z,"Come On guys.I just see all of your commnets.THE GAMES WORKS.I upload only working stuff.I have exactly details to how figure out this to work.EXACTLY.Happy gaming to everyone.

The game works in no rooted phones and in rooted too.END"
