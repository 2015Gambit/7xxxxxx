Book Description

OS X and iOS Kernel Programming combines essential operating system and kernel architecture knowledge with a highly practical approach that will help you write effective kernel-level code. YouΓÇÖll learn fundamental concepts such as memory management and thread synchronization, as well as the I/O Kit framework. YouΓÇÖll also learn how to write your own kernel-level extensions, such as device drivers for USB and Thunderbolt devices, including networking, storage and audio drivers.

OS X and iOS Kernel Programming provides an incisive and complete introduction to the XNU kernel, which runs iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Mac OS X servers and clients. Then, youΓÇÖll expand your horizons to examine Mac OS X and iOS system architecture. Understanding AppleΓÇÖs operating systems will allow you to write efficient device drivers, such as those covered in the book, using I/O Kit.

With OS X and iOS Kernel Programming, youΓÇÖll:

Discover classical kernel architecture topics such as memory management and thread synchronization
Become well-versed in the intricacies of the kernel development process by applying kernel debugging and profiling tools
Learn how to deploy your kernel-level projects and how to successfully package them
Write code that interacts with hardware devices
Examine easy to understand example code that can also be used in your own projects
Create network filters

Whether youΓÇÖre a hobbyist, student, or professional engineer, turn to OS X andiOS Kernel Programming and find the knowledge you need to start developing
