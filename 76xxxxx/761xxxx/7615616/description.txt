Getting an error when trying to install or use Rosetta Stone?

This torrent contains an isolated environment so that there is no need to install Rosetta Stone on your computer - you can run right from the folder.

--

INSTRUCTIONS:

Just extract the folder wherever you want (using 7zip or WinRAR) (maybe just put in your Program Files folder so it's easy to find), and run the program and install languages.

The file to run the program is in the following folder:
%Program Files (x86)% > Rosetta Stone > Rosetta Stone Version 3 > RosettaStoneVersion3.exe

Just create a shortcut on your desktop so you don't have to find the .exe every time you run the program.

---

NOTE: After you've installed all your desired languages, you might want to just back it up (copy the folder somewhere) so that if the program ever breaks you can just restore the folder you backed up.

WARNING: Do not attempt to ever update the program or register. Just click NO if it asks.
