,bokehjoe,2012-09-13T12:21Z,"Man, There is no pleasing some people! They get something for FREE, and they still whine like a bunch of pussies! 

Anyway- Thank you 13endik. I appreciate your ul.

Everyone else- there are some artists that truly deserve that all of their fans lay their money down- Mr. Dylan is one of them. Please put out your hard earned cash at some point, for a new copy of course) and put Bob's hard-earned money in his pocket- what little percentage he sees after the sharks feed. He has paid his dues and a whole lot more. 

Thanks- From my soapbox- I'm out. 

Thanks again 13endik again tho.
