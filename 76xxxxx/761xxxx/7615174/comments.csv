I've never heard of this series, but have enjoyed much of Radical's catalog, and when at his best, Niles can write better than most, so I'd love to check it out.  

In any case, thanks for rejuvenating the comics releases, Spock."

It should be seeding... I mean, I'm seeding it regardless of whether or not TPB has updated the Seeders/Leechers numbers. uTorrent says I've uploaded more than the total size of the files and that there's almost three complete copies right now, which means you should get it pretty quickly. You should get it eventually, at any rate. Let me know if you have a problem, though.  "
