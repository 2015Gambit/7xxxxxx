NFO :
This is the infamous unreleased album.
Unreleased in the USA but not in Canada, Germany or France.
I was lucky enough to find a very nice Canadian Copy the other day.
I'm not a huge Rivers fan, but this among a few of his other LPs is
just simply a very good listen and the songs are a mixture of his writing
and some not-so-often covered songs. 

The sound is a nice blend of country-fried-stoner rock, kind
of a continuation of the sound off his "home grown" album
which itself is a hippie-esque trip, at this point Johnny
ridding himself of his slick suits, greased haircut
and small goatee of the Hollywood A Go Go days. 
At this point he looks like the 
backyard jew boy with a slightly rugged charm.
The cover looks more like a Santana album though
with a bit of the devil rock vibe with that deep red.

This was Johnny's last album on UA and it is said it was just a contract
obligation, and possibly there was some red tape preventing the release
in the USA..or simply he wasn't happy with it? 
I can only speculate.
It looks a bit thrown together in terms of the Graphic design of the cover.
The songs sound all from the same session and care was taken in the mix.
It's not some dodgy outtakes or demo disc.

Scant information is available on this LP. No players are listed but it does sound
like the same crew Rivers was using through the early 70's.
More than likely the same members as the album "home grown"

And that "crew" is one of the best! 

Probably goes like this:

Drums : Ronnie Tutt ,  Jim Gordon or Jim Keltner
(I do hear Jim in the mix on a few songs undoubtably)

Bass : Joe Osborne
Guitar : Mike Deasy
Piano : Larry Knechtel
Dorbro/Slide : James Burton
Flute : Jim Horn
Vocals : Johnny Rivers
Strings : Conducted by Glen D Hardin
