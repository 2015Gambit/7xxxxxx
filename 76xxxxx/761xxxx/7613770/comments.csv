By his side a ragtag gang of adventurers, a big game hunter, an Egyptian Queen and a surprised member of the Pond family. But little does the Doctor know there is someone else on board who will stop at nothing to keep hold of his precious, prehistoric cargo."

,FredSanford,2012-09-08T23:17Z,"I prefer AVI as well but the standard now is x264, most groups have phased out doing xvid releases.
Thanks for your great work TVT."
,Helmer2,2012-09-08T23:30Z,"Thanks for the Xvid, plays like a dream on my DVD. Keep Â´em cominÂ´:-)"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-09T01:35Z,@FredSanford: Actually most of the movie releases on here are Xvid.
,FredSanford,2012-09-09T02:17Z,"Sorry I meant the TV scene not all in general. lol
Just tossed on the dino episode, hoping its a good 1."
