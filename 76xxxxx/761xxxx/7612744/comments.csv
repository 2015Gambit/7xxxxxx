,RipperDaVe,2012-09-09T16:00Z,kaspersky 2013 says its fine - installed and works great/ Thanks for another quality upload!
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-10T05:24Z,"Yes, Kaspersky shows no problems with it. It's a false positive. 
Back to topic, downloaded and installed fine. I always do a clean install on new versions, so this time I did the same, uninstalled using Revo Uinstaller Pro, deleted all registry keys and other files.
When I installed, BEFORE PATCHING, it said I have 10 days left. Yes I did reboot my pc before installing. Why this problem? When you delete the registry keys, shouldn't it go back to showing 30 days left (the trial amount)? If I'm doing anything wrong, correct me or if I have to manually delete a registry entry, please advise so. Used Glary and CCleaner to get rid of the useless registry entries before installing too.
AFTER PATCHING it works totally fine and registers and all, but I want to know why that problem before the patch exists. Thank you once again!"

@RipperDaVe
Anytime ;)

@pearl15
No viruses at all here! Trust me ;)

@Heartofthorns
Revo uninstaller didn't delete some registry data, that's all.
But why care?
