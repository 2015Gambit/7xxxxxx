,snowbirds,2012-09-10T16:55Z,"It's amazing how critical people have been towards this movie.  It's basically the best Sci-fi movie in years and so many people are slamming it.  

Just so no one else is disappointed with this movie, keep these things in mind:

-it will not add 3 inches to your dick
-it will not grant you immortality
-it will not make you a millionaire
-it will not cure male pattern baldness

It is just a movie.  It's a damned exciting and damned interesting sci-fi movie with aliens in it.  It's not a perfect movie.  It has some minor flaws.  But the incredible things it does far outweigh the flaws.  For instance it WILL take you to an alien world and immerse you in it...

So stop whining and lighten the hell up.  Enjoy the movie.  It was made for ""entertainment"", not to solve your life's problems.

Thanks for the up E to the Z!  I waited for you because I knew you would be the best.

,Gargrevar001,2012-09-10T17:47Z,"To those people giving this v8, a8 purely on the basis that it is an SD rip, you are being moronic.

This is a DVD rip and as such should never be marked down because it is not a HD rip, that is just stupid.

As a DVD rip the audio and video IS 10/10.
It absolutely cannot be compared in quality to a HD rip because it is not one so people, if you are thinking of downloading this DVD rip, it is worth it.

Audio and video ARE both 10. (not compared to a BR Rip of course which would be a pointless exercise)."
,Minty_Winty,2012-09-10T18:18Z,"Good quality DVD rip.  I'd give it V-8 (some flaws on my 50"" plasma), A-10, from the few minutes I've watched so far.

Definite lip sync issues on PS3 playback.

Can anyone recommend good software for Mac that I can use to correct this?  The sync is off enough to be really distracting.  Thanks."

Probably the best copy out there right now, and very, very watchable.  However it's not perfect, and for this movie I want perfect.

On my laptop and with ear buds I watched the first 10 minutes or so.  I found the audio to have some crackly distortion to it, even at low volume.  

The pictures was very slightly fuzzy and dark parts were pixilated.

,Talonkardex,2012-09-12T05:16Z,how do you fix the out of syn audio for the ps3...using ps3 media server and it's off by about 2-3 seconds
,Minty_Winty,2012-09-12T05:30Z,"To the people saying use VLC to fix the sync, the problem is it's synced when played on a computer, but as soon as you plug it into the PS3 it's out.

So now we have to try to fix it in a video player that works to compensate for a player that doesn't?  Just how many times will I have to adjust the audio back and forth from my computer to my PS3?  I tried VLC for MAC and it was a pile of shit, didn't fix a damn thing.  QTSync for MAC was a pile of shit.  AVImux for MAC didn't even open, so it's a pile of shit.

The fix is for PS3-TEAM to make a comeback, not one of their torrents had this problem.  Maybe it's time for me to figure out what they were doing for PS3 files, and provide proper PS3 rips."

In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares ""strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak"", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.
And to all those people that say its crap, you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about its like the best movie ever."

But the rest of the movie if FUCKING AWESOME, and I LOVED IT, and I can't wait for the HD rip to come out (or a great quality DVD rip, because this copy is a not great quality for a DVD rip --yeah, everyone saying it's a 10/10 must be watching it on their fucking iPhones!)

Great upload as always EZ!

On the subject of ""is this a prequal to Alien or not?""

I was sceptical as well throughout the film, and decided that it's not, just a lot of similarities with the robots and stuff.
But at the end  (last minute or so) you have to admit that the alien (that looks like the alien from Alien) that bursts out of the corps' belly and does that tipical mouth that comes out of the mouth thing is pretty much a pointer that sais ""Hey! By the way... I'm a prequal!"""

,reconomgwtfbbq,2012-09-15T18:35Z,"It IS a prequal. 

*SPOILERS MAY BE BELOW*

1. Wayland Industries is the same ""company"" with the same logo ""(W)Building better worlds"" which plays a huge part in Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien 4, AvP(pc), AvP2(pc), AvP3(pc) and Colonial Marines(pc)

2. The synthetic known as ""David"" is a direct early replica of the other synthetics which also play big roles in the Alien franchise such as ""Bishop""

3. LV-223 is one of the planets in the system which contains the biological mutating weapon of Xenomorphs. Alien and Aliens take part on the neighbor planet of LV-426 in the same solar system.

4. The very distinct race Xenomorph is one which biologically adapts and steals fragments of its hosts DNA which is CLEARLY seen in the movie. So although it may not directly look as the known ""Alien"" you can clearly see the resemblance. 

5. The ""Engineer"" ship(s) is the exact same model in which the Xenomorphs first build their hive in Alien and Aliens

6. Finally, the last stage of the evolutionary xenomorph which we see in this movie is CLEARLY a Alien (Xenomorph). If you cannot see the resemblance then you are blind and need glasses. The mutation, the parasite, facehugger and chestburster stages are ALL seen in the movie. 

If you had seen the other Alien movies, you would clearly know that this is a prequel. It is very obvious. "

This is a lame attempt at a sci-fi horror flick. I was bored throughout the entire movie. You will find yourself full of questions at the end of it, one of them being WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME WATCHING THIS GIANT PIECE OF SHIT.

,Romeo92,2012-09-17T20:42Z,"People STOP whining about the story. This is no attempt, Ridley kept telling us that this is no prequel for the Alien movie!! This is a first half of a prequel, so don't take this totally serious because it won't answer all of your questions about Alien. This happened on LV223 , Alien happened on LV246. So we can assume that Ridley wanted to tell us more about the past than the actual prequel of Alien. The reason that he left us more questions than answers. Jeez, just enjoy the movie and say thanks to @extremezone that he made us this available, right?"

all you haters are not true fans. If you pay close attention in the first movie of aliens you will notice some very familiar visuals. Also this is just the first movie. there will be a sequal. There is so much more he can do with this. This is how Hollywood does things now or did you guys totally miss the whole lame super hero line up before we got the Avengers?
