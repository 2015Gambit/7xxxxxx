Any chance of getting George C. Chesbro's Mongo series? There's a couple of torrent out there with 6 of his books...but no seeders anymore.
Appreciate it."

Look for it in my next flood #23"

,JoeMatey,2012-09-10T18:10Z,"Seems like there is a duplication in 21, 22, 23 of the floods.  If I choose 21 after 22, or 23, I get a message that the d/l is already in the queue for d/l.

Great work though!"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-10T19:28Z,"@JoeMatey

I got all three floods to download simultaneously using different combination's,in terms of download order ,with no problems.

It will download even if the floods have duplicates because each torrent has it's own separate data "
