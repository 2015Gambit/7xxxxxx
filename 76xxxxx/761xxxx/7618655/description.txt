Connecting writing to everyday life, THE CALL TO WRITE, Brief Fifth Edition, continues its long tradition of breaking new ground in composition. Organized by genres, including letters, memoirs, public documents, profiles, reports, commentaries, proposals, and reviews, this innovative rhetoric gives students the practice they need to write both in college and in the public sphere. An emphasis on public writing promotes civic involvement, while relevant, provocative readings help students understand the concept of being "called to write" in response to a personal, community, or societal need.
