,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-08T22:09Z,"You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files!

Do it like this guy..

,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-08T22:28Z,"It does not take 5 mins to convert. My point is why upload the same exact x264 as everyone else? I am a hot little potato when I get on here and 5 uploaders all upload x264! Xvid/Divx is more compatible, more people would download it in that format than having to convert it later. I want to shove my shoe horn up your ass and rip your taint!"
,Lorax98,2012-09-08T22:29Z,"Upgrade your shit!!
x264 plays on my TV using USB phone or stick.
Smaller file size & better video quality.
Why don't you convert it to what you need and re-upload for everyone else that will not keep up with tech."
,simon200,2012-09-08T22:31Z,"BUTT_SEX you're a retard, if you don't like what's being uploaded then fuck off and don't download it and stop posting links to other torrents here"
,Kaleigh_S,2012-09-08T22:33Z,thanks. ;).
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-08T22:49Z,"My point is the difference in quality is only marginal at best, and so what if a x264 file is 20mb smaller than a Xvid/Divx file of comparable quality? It's better to have the more versatile file. And my shit is upgraded. I'm downloading a x264 at around 1.15 gb AND the xvid encoded avi that I had linked. 

Xvid is the standard around here if you haven't noticed. I burn the Xvid file to disc, so that I can play it for others where ever I go. That way it's compatible in most dvd and bluray players, along with PS3's and XBOX too!

Sure I could just convert the file, but what would be the point in that when someone had already uploaded the proper Xvid encoded avi? 

Maybe some of you are a little late to the game, but I've been downloading and seeding Doctor Who on here ever since it came back on the air in 2005!

And Simon boy, I'm not downloading this torrent.  If I wanted x264 quality I'd just go with the 1.15 gb file which is essentially 720p, which I've already stated I am downloading. "

Agree 110%"
[T],spevman,2012-09-09T00:51Z,"Everyone, you do realize that EZTV is merely the distributor of the file, right?  The encode is done by the scene group (in this case FoV).  All scene groups have gone over to MP4.  P2P groups/people like AFG are taking the scene releases and re-encoding them to XviD encoded AVI files.

If you can't wait for an AVI version, download the MP4 and convert it yourself like i do.  I use Pazera Free MP4 to AVI Converter.  I set it to XviD codec and the same audio bitrate as the MP4.  I also set the FPS to the same as the MP4 and generally use a video bitrate of about 1.4 times that of the MP4 and they look fine.  You'll never get a transcoded AVI from an MP4 at the same video bitrate to look as good as the original file.  So, you're stuck with a file that's larger then the old scene XviD version would have been, but that's life."
,themagni,2012-09-09T01:05Z,"EZTV, I've said this before and I hope to say it again, you are a wonderful person.

If you ever want a beer, or bail money, or whatever, let me know.  "
,Druzzle,2012-09-09T01:08Z,"Hey BUTT_SEX ive been downloading Doctor who since it came back and i always come to eztv because the uploader has been constant and reliable since the Doctor came back on. 
You said that you weren't downloading this torrent yet your on this page complaining about how Piratebay and the uploaders don't make there torrents suited to you, so why not grow up and stop complaining about a free service which has been put up for our enjoyment"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-09T01:40Z,"@Druzzle: Actually MadMartha used to be the old great Doctor Who uploader. But she disappeared, lol. Albiondean's releases were usually the best quality when it came to Xvid. Don't get me wrong, eztv and the scene scene are great too. But they have mostly moved to x264 now. Thanks to everyone that uploads though!"
,trace535,2012-09-09T01:43Z,"The old Xvid rules were based on 2 episodes (2x350MB) per CD, and that's way obsolete now: http://nfo.sceper.eu/nfo/The.XviD.Releasing.Standards.2009.png

You're either a moron or you have a shitty bluray player. My bluray plays eztv's x264 files just fine and always has."
,acc6804,2012-09-09T03:31Z,"Dear BUTT_SEX,
MP4 files play just fine on a PS3. Go away. Thank you."
,cycowolf,2012-09-09T03:50Z,I want to complain too!
,Dyang,2012-09-09T04:23Z,Thanks dude. I really wanted to avoid torrenting Doctor Who because i love the show. I've bought all the series since the ninth doctor and i just hate having to watch series seven this way. I always miss it because of work and i don't have bbcamerica or cable so i can't watch it. I would watch it on livestream but i'm at work on saturdays. Thanks a bunch guys. I really appreciate it.
,Druzzle,2012-09-09T05:22Z,"@BUTT_SEX,Never heard of MadMartha but yeah i do remember Albiondean, so my bad and sorry i thought you were hating on eztv after that last  comment i realize you weren't so my apologizes "
,unicornsex,2012-09-09T11:23Z,"My TV can usually plug-and-play MP4 files just fine, but there's something about this episode and the last that just haven't worked?

Other than that, love all your uploads eztv; muchos gracias. "
,tm191919,2012-09-09T13:12Z,"@unicornsex 

Agreed. I have no problem playing all sorts of mp4 episodes on my WDTV Live, but not these Doctor Who's from FoV. Don't know why."
,clamyfishsticks,2012-09-09T15:18Z,"since the change to magnet links, everyone seems to have changed to .mp4s... I agree with those that do not like them. I cannot play them on PS3 or the 360. I have to rely on the computer... I cannot use the computer as it's my son's and I can only use it while he is at school... and my wife can't ever use it since she works when my son isn't home... and he never leaves :(

I don't have time to convert and converting usually puts stuff out of synch anyway.

I get that a lot of you people use phones and ipods to watch stuff, but us old people prefer TVs. we also prefer not paying the TV companies that keep cancelling anything even half decent.

you guys can have all the arguments you want, but it solves nothing. you have opinions, we get that, but people are different, and others have different opinions. no ones opinion is better than another.

The fact is that I and many others don't download from eztv anymore unless we have no choice. 
I definitely don't seed anymore because I don't believe in the format he switched to. I used to DL EVERYTHING from ez... but now, I only come to his torrents looking for links to avi format links... thanks buttsexs... I'd use ettv's avi files but for some reasons not a one of them has been watchable on PS3 or 360... so for now, that's just how it's gotta be :("
,wafflerevolution,2012-09-09T15:29Z,"all the arguing... jeez... I have to agree though, I'm not fond of the way everyone's gone over to the mp4 crap... I also used a 360 to watch stuff on my main TV as did my roomates, now we can't.... luckily my computer is a bad ass and hooked up to my other TV... but it sucks for my roomates who can't use my public videos folder to watch shows on the main TV anymore."
,damek25,2012-09-09T17:03Z,Are you really so f*cking dumb asswipes? The new standard is coming and it doesn't matter whether you or your roommates can't play the shit on their old hardware. Deal with it for gods sake. Or upload it yourselves for other cunts like you.
,Polymathj,2012-09-09T20:53Z,"I can't believe I'm saying this...

I agree with Butt_Sex.  Make the files accessible by the most possible players.  Fuck mkv and rar while we're at it."
