,RGL2012,2012-09-09T18:26Z,I will seed at 1mbps for a week.. then it's up to you guys to seed this! 
,RodrigoAviation,2012-09-10T16:14Z,"Thaanks maan, i'm waiting this for mounths! After downloading i'll back here to say if the 777 serial is working fine! And seed please, thank you very much! :)"
,black.hat,2012-09-10T17:23Z,it looks like most people are pulling out of the torrent as soon as they hit 100% which is a shame considering the number of people that seem to want this download. i'm connected to more than 40 peers right now but i'm not gonna keep seeding my butt off for greedy people who won't give back to the torrent!  so please seed for as long as you can...it's the right thing to do!  thank you and you're welcome  ;-)
,RGL2012,2012-09-10T17:37Z,If the serial doesn't work.. BUY IT! The 777 is amazing! THE BEST plane so far.. WELL worth the money.. (although I just had to buy a new video card.. my 1gb was lagging so I got the Radeon HD 7950 3gb card!! Shit yeah!) I'll be uploading some general aviation planes soon for all you prop guys out there..
,RGL2012,2012-09-10T17:39Z,In this day and age.. There's no excuse not to SEEEEDDD!!!  I'm uploading 1mbps and it isn't affecting my internet speed (comcast 50mbps plan) at all! Don't be a greedy shit weasel! SEED IT!
,RGL2012,2012-09-10T17:46Z,SEED IT! there's no excuse not to in this day and age.. I'm seeding at 1mbps and it isn't affecting the other three computers online here.. at all.. Don't hit and run you greedy bastards.. :)
,Sparks13,2012-09-10T18:32Z,"Yes, the 777 serial number no longer works. I will continue to seed @ 340 Ks (my max) for as long as I can. Thanks for the torrent RGL2012. Keep them coming and don't get too upset with the non-seeders, it goes with the territory."
,RodrigoAviation,2012-09-11T02:53Z,"Hey guys, how can I activate the CRJ?"
,RodrigoAviation,2012-09-11T03:04Z,The CRJ displays doesn't work! What should I do?
,RGL2012,2012-09-11T17:32Z,Did you update it? the updater is in the crj-200 folder
,RGL2012,2012-09-11T17:38Z,Sorry my bad.. the crj-200 is already v1.45 the challenger-300 has the update included.. check the forums.. I ran it with a mediocre video card and it worked fine
,max-1985,2012-09-11T23:01Z,"so you want to say that CRJ doesnt require a pass??.....thats not right as the blank disp problem is authentical-pass-related, so RGL2012 would you be so kind to share it,,,,,,,,thanks in advance!"
,max-1985,2012-09-11T23:08Z,"hey peop, disregard my last transmission)......the solution is to delete files from ""CRJ-200pluginsCRJAvionicscache""........everything works fine,,,,ant again TNX to RGL2012!!"
,Helochut,2012-09-12T04:24Z,The panel PFD does not work because there is a missing key. The CRJ either needs the key or serial.dat found in pluginsCRJAvionicsresources. It would be amazing if the author could provide it?
,Donutte,2012-09-12T10:12Z,"3.5 kb/s avg download speed lol, gonna take me 2 weeks to download this one"
,Donutte,2012-09-15T11:21Z,"Is it possible to upload the key file of the Boeing 777? It seems that you have to activate the serial in the Internet then they'll give you a key file, probably that'll bypass the online activation by just giving us the key file?"
,moskox,2012-09-20T09:53Z,Damn was hoping to use the 777 :( Anyway... ill keep seeding :/ 
,moskox,2012-09-20T10:03Z,All we need is a key file for the 777PRO... if anyone would be so kind to upload that! 
,fenriz747,2012-09-20T11:42Z,Key file is useless. One serial number/activation = only one pc/mac machine. RGL2012's key is activated only for his pc/mac. We need pure serial number = buy :/ unless someone make a crack for that lame protection. 
,moskox,2012-09-22T02:45Z,It has something to do with a file in the SASL folder in plugins. Since when its turned off the activation leaves but unable to click any buttons..
,Ranodinho,2012-09-24T17:00Z,"All of the planes worked, except for the CRJ.
I am a Mac user so seing an .exe file just makes me shit bricks, so i tried using Crossover. ""X-Plane.exe not found"" D: I can't install it on a Mac? If anyone has any suggestions, please let me hear them."
,moskox,2012-09-25T09:31Z,@Ranodinho you got the 777 to work? o.o 
,Xplanepro,2012-09-25T10:03Z,"This is awesome, thanks for taking the time to upload these beauties..Any chance you will add any helicopters :)?"
