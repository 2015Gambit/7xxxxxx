To me, this video represents how I personally felt and feel about
what Hip Hop and gangsta culture morphed into at the close of the 1990's.

I special ordered this VHS taope from a Record shop in the late 90's and when
I viewed it 
I was blown away at the concept and it fits so well with what I was feeling
with the whole music scene
as it deconstructs the subliminal and the obvious in a way that has many
scratching their heads, wanting to turn away and / or getting the vibe.

What Chris and Rich collaborate and create is a reflection of the toy posturing, 
out of context language, and super sexual induction of the music video distorted
to point out that people will just gravitate towards some inflated titties
and some sexy gyrating, no matter what face you prop up there.

They go deep with the goulish faces and carbon copy Richards'
and they still have the homies dancing and rockin ready to bus'
a nut yo.

The music is also a concept that takes Hip hop, swirls it around a bit and
uses the auto-tune like sounds which are now so engrained that his could be
the parody of parodies of the genre.
