Hard Stuff - Discography [Heavy Prog]


  Hard Stuff consisted of two musicians that split from Atomic Rooster, the guitarist John Du  Cann, and drummer Paul Hammond-also there was vocalist Harry Shaw, who left the band just before the release of their first album, so was not credited. Then came Johnny Gustafson from Quatermass on bass and some vocals, who ended up appearing on both resultant studio albums.
  They released two hard progressive rock studio albums, Bulletproof in 1972 and Bolex Dementia in 1973. Something that rattled the band's security was that  Du Cann and Hammond had a serious car accident, and that pretty well sealed things for Hard Stuff.
   Bulletproof is the best album, and is a five star record, as far as i see it. Bolex Dementia has some good songs, but is a little uneven. I like Hard Stuff just as much, maybe even more so, than the later Atomic Rooster records without Du Cann and Hammond.
   This band was short-lived, but i would recommend their two albums if you want a guitar-based trio that does things just right-man, they are even better than Budgie or Rush!
