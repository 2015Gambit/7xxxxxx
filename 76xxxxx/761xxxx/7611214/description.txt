While strolling through the sunny woods one day, you spy a man slithering through the undergrowth, heavily camouflaged and gripping a bow and arrow.
ΓÇ£What are you hunting?ΓÇ¥ you ask.
ΓÇ£Dragons!ΓÇ¥ hisses the man proudly.
You frown. ΓÇ£Dragons? But dragons donΓÇÖt exist!ΓÇ¥
The man nods emphatically. ΓÇ£I completely agree with you! There ainΓÇÖt no such thing as dragons. And IΓÇÖm a-gonna shoot me one!ΓÇ¥ He raises his bow and arrow, narrows his eyes and glares through the trees, hungry to target the non-existent. At this point, you would surely take a series of slow and steady steps backwards, aiming to put some safer distance between you and a deranged man wielding a bow and arrow. This is one of the many, many challenges of atheism.
ΓÇ£AtheismΓÇ¥ is a terrible word on many levels...
