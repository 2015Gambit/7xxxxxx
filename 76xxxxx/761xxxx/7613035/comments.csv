,Bali2011,2012-09-08T17:07Z,Don't know how would I spend my Saturday without this. Thanks...
,notinmontreal,2012-09-08T17:12Z,again you are excellent
,Abawcom,2012-09-08T17:50Z,"Okay, something is def wrong with last weekend and this weekends F1 torrents. First off THANK YOU so much for uploading these footy, you give me access to the sport i love. Second ive been downloading from you for a long time and have never had this much trouble connecting to seeds. At this point in my download i should be connected to at least 1 but i have none. I'm not educated on torrents enough to know what the problem is, just to know that there IS a problem."
,graystate,2012-09-08T17:58Z,Thanks a heap Footy. You should check out the darmeth website. F1 forum site that would love to have you around. Cheers.
,drew1972,2012-09-08T18:34Z,"As ever, you friggin' rock FOOTY!"
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-08T19:25Z,Abawcom may be right! I have 59 seeds for P3 but 0 for Quali even though TPB is showing 89. 
,andrejorg,2012-09-08T19:41Z,"First of all, thank you sooo much footy for all these great torrents!

and .. it's definitely been something going wrong lately. Seems like the ""availability"" of the torrent increases slowly. Can somebody explain why? Is there simply too many trying too download from the beginning?  
Downloaded P3 couple of hours after release and there was no problem at all .. "

,iluvjumpz,2012-09-08T20:33Z,"Thanks a lot footy, it would be great if you could upload bbc 720p version of the race tomorrow :"
,Abawcom,2012-09-08T21:03Z,So the same thing that happened to me last weekend happened here. During 99.7% of the download i didn't connect to one seed. Just like last weekend as soon i hit that 99.7% mark the seed flood gates opened and i connected to 6 seeds immediately. Don't know whats going on here but i'm seeding now at full capacity.
,Torporo,2012-09-08T21:19Z,"Well deserved pink skull footy, thnx for the formula 1 stuff!!!"
