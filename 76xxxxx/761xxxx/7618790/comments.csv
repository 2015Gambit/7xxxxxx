,JorgePoty,2012-09-26T16:59Z,"When I clicked  the ""EZ-Activator"" button this message appeared:
""Cannot use EZ-Activator because your licensing details are corrupt.""

What do I do?"
,coks92,2012-09-26T23:21Z,"tnx man,works perfect :)"
,rocketmanzzz,2012-09-27T04:48Z,No grammar or spell check on two computers with XP that I installed it on.
,MyDarkstar,2012-09-29T18:51Z,"I ran the setup and used the trial key provided and then ran the tookit and used the EZ-Activator button. It seemed to do everything perfectly. But then when I opened Office for the first time it still prompted me for a license key. I didn't have anything else so I used the trial key. Now it's just set up like a trial and will expire in 30 days. 

Did I do something wrong here ? I'd like a permanent copy. Thanks for your help."
,lub094,2012-09-29T20:20Z,"You can try running the activator again, if that doesn't try to re-install."
,MyDarkstar,2012-09-30T18:58Z,"I actually did re-run the toolkit again and then used the EZ-Activator button. But again, it prompted me for a product key as soon as I opened Word. Should it be prompting me ? If so, is there a non-trial product key created by the EZ-activator at some point ? 

One thing which may be something : When I initially use the setup there is a clicked box which asks if I would like to activate online. I un-clicked that box because I just figured it wouldn't work. Should I leave that button clicked and allow it to try and activate it online ? That doesn't seem right, but it's the only thing that seems to be a question. 

Thanks for any help you can give."
