Information
------------------------------

From the sea horse that mates in an hypnotic underwater ballet to the rodent who copulates until he literally drops dead, THE NATURE OF SEX spans the globe to illustrate how an astonishing diversity of life forms find their mates and conceive, raise, and protect their offspring. This Web companion to the four-part series takes a close look at the primal instinct that causes animals to come together in order to pass along their genes to the next generation. We also examine how timing can be key in the mating process, and how varied sex contracts create not only new life, but diversity, in both animals and humans.




6)  The Young Ones 
This final segment in PBS's landmark nature series, THE NATURE OF SEX, finishes up the educational fun by focusing on the result of sex -- children. Exploring the bond between parent and child, "The Young Ones" is a positive, illuminating look at the glorious product of the natural drive for sex.
In this final chapter of the series, the subject is the fruit of sexual relations: the young ones. Spectacular wildlife photography captures the birth and care of the progeny of animal species. There are heartwarming shots of wild creatures, who gently and patiently teach their offspring the necessary skills to survive. Whether there is just one baby or a litter of twelve, parents forge strong bonds with their young.
