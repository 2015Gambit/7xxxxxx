 FIFA 13 captures all the drama and unpredictability of real-world soccer,

 artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and physical play.

 These innovations create a true battle for possession across the entire
 pitch, deliver freedom and creativity in attack, and capture all the
 drama and unpredictability of the real-world game.
