A host of hellacious horror stories await you in with a witch's baleful batch of Bongo brew-haha.  Jim Valentino (Shadowhawk) makes a terrifying toast to the Frankenstein monster's bride: Gerry Duggan (Attack of the Show!) and Phil Noto (Danger Girl) wet your appetite with the tale of an innocent woman forced into spawning the son of Satan; Chris and Shane Houghton (Reed Gunther) fill you with dread as they lead the Simpson family to a cabin in the woods; and much more.
