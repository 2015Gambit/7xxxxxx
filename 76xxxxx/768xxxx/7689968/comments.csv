,LMTPBay,2012-10-01T04:16Z,What's the point of making it 60FPS? Won't that just make the video/audio out of sync since it's meant to be at 24FPS?

I may have missed it. But, is this 6 ch audio?"
,susulock,2012-10-01T05:05Z,Why is this 60 FPS? Was the original airing of this episode of Dexter in 60 FPS? Or did you just add dummy frames?

,Hydrogen9826,2012-10-01T06:06Z,"60fps and my mba fans running at fullspeed. This is bizarre, might be that the cable comapny are just cheating an you. I could see no differance on 30fps and 60fps."
,TeDrizzle,2012-10-01T06:14Z,Christ you stingy bastards seed!  138kbps is fucking ridiculous with 1.6k seeds! 
,steaz55,2012-10-01T06:27Z,Why .ts and not .mkv? 
,hmathews8,2012-10-01T06:30Z,"Just finished watching the episode. Audio is great, but the video quality is just okay. Didn't notice any difference with it being 60 FPS. "
,ThePirateOfPirateBay,2012-10-01T06:50Z,Thanks! This is one of the best ones available! I wonder why the download is really slow...
,tkco,2012-10-01T07:16Z,nice! it's totally legit. i'll def be back next sunday for episode 2
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-01T07:32Z,"@Hydrogen9826
60FPS is meant for fast-paced scenes on TV and sports. The difference is substantial. This episode of Dexter though had nothing worth the 60FPS. If you download an MMA torrent of mine, you'd see what I mean. It creates a smoother transition rather than a blur of pixels during motion shots.

@hmathews8
Pretty much same as the reply above, except the  bitrate of the video can be manually changed during the capture, and kept it at a medium level. I'm thinking of upping the bitrate for next week, but I'm trying not to let the 60FPS + bitrate affect the filesize too much. 

@Everyone
If you're experiencing slow download speeds, look at the seeders/leechers and you'll know why. There's only about half the amount of people downloading as there is uploading, and upload speeds are typically much slower than download. I'm uploading at 6MB/s, and see a few others uploading from 500kb/s to 1.5MB/s. Your download speed in comparison to what is being seeded is most likely the problem, and most seem to be seeding. Remember, just because there's a lot of seeders on a file does not mean it's going to go fast. It all depends on the ratio of leechers to seeders."
,-xbt-,2012-10-01T07:47Z,DL speed is SHIT
,-xbt-,2012-10-01T07:58Z,THIS SHIT IS TS NOT X264. CANNOT STREAK THROUGH LOCAL MEDIA STREAMING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PLAY THE SOUND. FUCK YOU BITCH FUCK YOU FOR WASTING MY FUCKING TIME MOTHER FUCKER. NOW I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANOTHER ONE. FUCK YOU FUCKING CUNT BITCH.
,-xbt-,2012-10-01T07:59Z,CAN'T STREAM THIS FUCKING SHIT NO FUCKING SOUND. IT IS NOT X264 MOTHER FUCKER IT IS A .TS WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT IT'S NOT EVEN A VIDEO SHELL. FUCK YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HAHAHAHAHA. What an idiot. :)"
,Luck107,2012-10-01T09:57Z,WTF is a .ts file?
,valizio007,2012-10-01T11:03Z,"SecTPB has no idea what he is doing. He says he is a proffesional encoder. But his work proves he is not.

In USA HDTV is broadcasted in 1080i 60 fps 2~8 mbps bitrate. If its capped then its kept in 1080i ts format. Like fizo did with game of thrones 1080i caps if people remember.

However 1080i means 1920x1080 video INTERLACED. When its capped its kept in that format. All cappers provide a LOG along with the cap. For example TrollHD or EbP

^^ These files are in TS format. TS means Transport Stream. Difference between these and encodes are same as mp3 vs flac. Lossy vs Lossless.

A
HOWEVER DEXTER WASNT BROADCASTED in 720i on any networks. So this files is a forged  bullsh*t.

B
IF this is an encode then ONLY A DOUCHE will keep it at 60 fps. INTERLACED VIDEO HAS TO BE AND MUST BE DEINTERLACED when encoding. It can be done in the avisynth script.

C
DEXTER WAS BROADCASTED IN UNITED STATES BY ""SHOWTIME"" with Dolby Digital 5.1 Ch 384 kbps audio. When this douche decided to make it a 2 Ch shitty AAC.

If I had some time I'd have done a 1080i cap vs SECTPB vs EVOLVE screenshot and showed how shitty this is.
But hey is it even needed.

,VDBP,2012-10-01T11:06Z,"Thanx SecTPB grate upload looking forward to your next Dexter uploads

+1 for you , and will continue seeding"
,rickardx,2012-10-01T11:46Z,"60 FPS is awesome. Only people with SHIT pc's/ eyes / retard brain can't tell the huge difference.

Fucking idiots.

MORE 60 FPSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!

FUCKING MORONS STOP WHINING GO EAT SHIT YOU NON CONTRIBUTING FUCKWIT CUNTFACES."
,Norogh22,2012-10-01T12:31Z,can anyone please upload subtitles for this version?
,rmekdaschi,2012-10-01T14:09Z,"@-xbt- Shut the fuck up and encode it with handbrake you lazy, ungrateful ingrate. Or download EVOLVEs release!"
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-03T13:35Z,"@valizio007
Grow up. Harping on a TV release that's free? You got some nerve. 
It's as simple as this for those wondering:

I have a cable provider that uses the more superior modded MPEG4/AVC codec rather than MPEG2.

The cable provider provides broadcasts at 1080i/30FPS, 720p/60FPS, 480i/30FPS, 480p/60FPS.

I can capture any of the above resolutions at 20Mbps max.

My capture device can encode for me live as the broadcast is being aired in Variable Bitrate, or Constant Bitrate.

I set the capture box to encode while airing at 720p at around 7Mbps manually on purpose.

The encode is done when the show is done, so I can upload the files instantly online, and am always the first, and do this so people do not have to wait long, reducing the capture box's encode quality as well so the size isn't too dramatic.

Just as my True Blood rips of the past, I am capable of capturing the original broadcast as aired at 1080i/30FPS, Dolby Digital 5.1 audio @ 384 kbps, but why upload a massive file if I want to get it to everyone fast? Makes no sense to give the real .ts out in that case. 

I cap using a transport stream's container because the only way I can cut ads/commercials out without encoding is using special programs that cut h.264 transport stream files. Basically, I can cut the stream without re-encoding again, leaving the quality and data rate intact. 

For this next episode of Dexter, I've decided to increase the bitrate a bit to enhance the quality of the automatic encode capture. I wasn't pleased with how low of a bitrate I allowed the capture box to use for capturing the show.

Maybe I will also release the true 1080i .ts as I did previously with the last True Blood season after uploading the quick-rip 720p/60FPS encode.

Anyway, valizio007, learn some proper manners, stop being spoiled, and don't assume you know everything. You look like an idiot. Learn to say thank you and if you question something, then ask the question, don't badmouth someone. Your parents should have beat some manners and common sense into you while growing up. Also, don't expect a further reply to anything stupid you have to say. This is the last time."
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-03T13:41Z,"And to everyone being supportive and complimentary, thank you. I don't have to do this stuff, but I stay at home specifically so I can capture TV for everyone of shows I like as well, giving up my time and my nights, along with my internet for those less privileged to watch it(due to shitty US economy and no cable), or don't even get the show at all in their country. It's nice to hear good feedback, and I will continue capping as I am for all of your enjoyment."
,Hakuei,2012-10-03T20:49Z,"Don't waste your time with this one, EVOLVE version is way better."
,hutness,2012-10-04T05:38Z,"We do appreciate all your hard work, SecTPB. Don't listen to the ungrateful fools. 
One request though. Next time, can you do Dexter or Homeland and cap it to less than 4 gigs? Like even 3.95 gigs. Something that I can store it into a flash drive? If you can, that is. Thanks again for  giving up your time and nights for us. "
