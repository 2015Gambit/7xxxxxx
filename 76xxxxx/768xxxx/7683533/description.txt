Unlike his three cohorts on the court of The Original Kings of Comedy, D.L. Hughley has quietly amassed a body of work that rivals -- if not bests -- the works of Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac. His show The Hughleys lasted longer than Cedric's show and Harvey's show, and his standup dates and specials consistently sell out. His first record takes samples from his most recent tour, and is a textbook example of observational humor. On the surface, Hughley could be considered to be just another comic with a foul mouth. But closer observation reveals a venomous disdain -- on par with Chris Rock, Sam Kinison, and other legends of the genre -- for the lack of common sense in the world. He covers the topics predictably -- the war in Iraq, children, social issues, and entertainment scandals -- but his delivery is fresh and energetic. A long overdue debut, but a very welcome and highly entertaining one.
