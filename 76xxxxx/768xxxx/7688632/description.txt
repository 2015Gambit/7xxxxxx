Information
------------------------------

The next revolution in motorcycle engineering is here. Racer, architect and design daredevil, Michael Czysz, is on a mission-to build a world-class, made in America, super bike capable of competing at the Laguna Seca round of MotoGP. Motivated by a lack of innovation on the part of major manufacturers, Czysz has taken matters into his own hands, literally. His ultimate goal is to create high performance street bikes for the public in direct competition with elite Japanese and Italian companies. This outsider uses fresh ideas and innovative technology to achieve a stunning new level of motorcycle performance. Birth of a Racer joins Michael Czysz as he puts his new generation C1 prototype to the ultimate test.

Produced in 2007 by Strom Magallon.
