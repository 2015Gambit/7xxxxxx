,berlin,2012-09-28T22:58Z,sorry for spam!
,Milos2020,2012-09-28T23:09Z,Not working? How? What happens? CTD while loading? or something else
,berlin,2012-09-29T01:53Z,CDT at the start
,berlin,2012-09-29T02:04Z,"CTD at the start, dont know why its happens!FTM working fine but not TFH..."
,massumibr,2012-09-29T02:09Z,"Milos2020, same thing here, at the end of the loading it crashes. Does anybody have a tip?"
,massumibr,2012-09-29T02:13Z,"I got the same, crashes at the end of loading. Any help?"
,kimmj,2012-09-29T03:22Z,thenoobish: can you please give us the link for the Hearts_Of_Iron_III_For_The_Motherland_STANDALONE-VACE  please? I can't find the torrent for it. Seems like skidrow version of hearts of iron 3 is not compatible with this crack.
,buffffer,2012-09-29T07:55Z,"For those of you having problems with CTDs: try installing TFH, and then patching via the launcher. I had no crashes when I did this, but I did not check before patching to see if that was the problem."
,berlin,2012-09-29T11:43Z,got it work had to reinstall entire game from scratch!
,SbeebK,2012-10-01T00:44Z,I couldn't get it to work even after installing everything from scratch. FTM worked fine. Are you supposed to upgrade to 1.4 before you install TFH? I tried both ways but am wondering for future ref.
,SbeebK,2012-10-01T05:44Z,A torrent too far...

,berlin,2012-10-01T08:56Z,"i did... 
1)Install hearts of iron III
Patch 1.2
Patch 1.4
Start the game-->game runs ok, do 2
2) Install Semper Fi
Patch 2.03

4) Install Their Finest Hour do not start the game patch it and then play
p.s. I think this is a beta because TFH files installing in different folder plus it wold not be possible to play FTM after you have installed TFH."
,berlin,2012-10-01T09:45Z,"sorry about misspelling the first one,didn't think it would post it:)"
,Comr,2012-10-04T01:01Z,"I'm not a noob at cracking. But this seems to be getting me. Whenever I open up the rar that has the .iso I need to mount in it and try to extract it, it comes with a window saying I need to locate a volume that contains the file I want to extract. But whenever I click browse and try to find the .rar that contains it, it doesn't show up. It doesn't even list the rar as a possible choice."
,fdsaftw,2012-10-04T06:21Z,"Everything works for me, but the game takes loads about 3x (or more!) time to load just about anything. What I did is:

1. Install game as normal
     a. extract RARs until you get an ISO
     b. mount and install as normal
2. Install patch from game launcher
3. DONE.

This worked for me, but like I said, everything takes forever to load."
