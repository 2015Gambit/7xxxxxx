Please could you upload Brand new Jonathan Butler Album "" GRACE and MERCY ""."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-30T16:44Z,"Tommycool88, yeah I've got that ""Grace And Mercy"" album sitting in my next bundle, waiting to be shared.  The bundle is currently sitting at about a gig.  And as you know, I bundle two gigs at a time.  So if I get a chance sometime today, I'll try and beef it up to two gigs, so I can get the Jonathan Butler up here for you quicker."

Thanks!"
,capemusic,2012-10-01T09:06Z,"Hi TT, keep up the good work - I always check back for what you have and seed as long as I can..  I think I asked before, but I'm looking for Hosanna! / Integrity music series (from the beginning till now) - even if you can get the songbooks would be nice. God bless you!!!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-01T14:29Z,"Syncnd, as Christians, we're to yoke ourselves with like-minded believers (2 Corinthians 6:14) so of course I'd like talking to many of you on a more personal basis. But unfortunately, because of the nature of The Pirate Bay, this isn't the the forum for such a thing outside of these threads. :(

As for Bishop Leonard Scott and Anthony Brown And Group Therapy, I'll keep a look out for you."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-01T14:36Z,"Capemusic, I knew I was forgetting to comment on something. Here's my problem.  Because those labels support Artists, I typically list those albums, not under ""Hosanna"", but rather under the Artist's name. For example, Don Moen has done lots with Hosanna, so I list those albums as ""Don Moen.""  And because of that, it's now nearly impossible for me to now determine if, and where, my Hosanna / Integrity albums are.  :("
,capemusic,2012-10-03T16:17Z,"Thanks for the feedback TT, I understand completely.  I have found some of the older stuff under your Alleluia! music...  as before, keep up the good work and thanks for all you do...  God bless ya!"
