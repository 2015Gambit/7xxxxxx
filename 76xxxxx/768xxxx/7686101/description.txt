These are a set of classic style mixtapes, done on cassette tape using various junk tape decks and random found Type I cassettes. Some were put together using Ardour2, others mixed live to tape. Almost all sources were lossless digital or vinyl, with some exceptions, notably #001 which is entirely from MP3 sources and #008-#009 which are direct vinyl to digital with no tape stage. Songs listed as ? were recorded off FM radio. No noise reduction was used. Sound quality varies wildly depending on the cassete and deck used. Files are in 48/16 FLAC format and have the track list in the comment tag, also included in a text file.
