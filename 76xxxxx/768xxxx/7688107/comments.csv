This video is encoded from a bluray source at 1920 X 800 because it does not have the black bars on the top and bottom encoded into the video.
If you encode the black bars into the video, yes, it will come out at 1920 X 1080, but it will also be wasting precious space and bitrate on storing the extra information which could be put to better use storing the actual video.

You should try learning more about what you talk about, you come off as looking like a real idiot."
