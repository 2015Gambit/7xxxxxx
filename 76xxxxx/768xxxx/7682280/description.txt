This is the bonus DVD from the Silent Hill 2 PAL special edition. It's very rare since it was not released in any other edition.

It includes the making of Silent Hill 2 documentary (like 30 minutes), Team Silent biographies, trailers, art gallery and more.

I copied the full DVD without recompression from my original disc. It is in English, but the making of also has French subtitles and of course the developers speak mostly in Japanese.

Hope you enjoy and seed! I seed for indefinite time, but if you are a true Silent Hill fan or simply like this torrent don't forget to seed as much as you can!
