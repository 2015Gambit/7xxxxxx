,NatyTuk,2012-09-29T22:03Z,God bless you
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-29T22:06Z,Thanks for uploading but waiting for the proper xvid encoded avi release. :P
,wcrouse747,2012-09-29T22:45Z,Thanks so much! Will seed.

,trace535,2012-09-29T22:48Z,"BUTT_SEX,

The scene groups that release .avi videos use FFmpeg and Xvid, two open source packages you can get from ffmpeg.org and xvid.org.

HOWEVER, if you do not have the technical knowledge to install and use these command-line programs, you can use something like this:

http://download.cnet.com/Pazera-Free-MP4-to-AVI-Converter/3000-2194_4-10784027.html

which is just a GUI for FFmpeg and Xvid, so that you can convert videos yourself from mp4/x264 to avi/xvid.

It will be exactly the same quality as what the release groups would give you, since you are using the same tools and codec.

I don't know how much clearer I can make this."
,megoesmo0,2012-09-29T22:53Z,Tnx for the upload and tnx for making it x264
,megoesmo0,2012-09-29T22:56Z,"@trace535

BUTT_SEX is just a troll who writes this xvid shit on every x264 release so don't feed him ;)"
,aitikin,2012-09-29T23:37Z,"Thanks for this.

Video was good, audio had gain issues, at least on my setup."
,trace535,2012-09-30T00:21Z,"megoesmo0, you're probably right. I just needed to get it off my chest."
,DreamGoddessLindsey,2012-09-30T00:50Z,"Actually, no, he or she is not a troll. I happen to agree with him or her. All I see on this site is MP4, which quite frankly, is a crap container. It's not compatible with transcoding on a PS3 for viewing on a television, and that right there makes it inferior to AVI or even MKV (most of the time). MP4 simply isn't a widely supported format, so it baffles me that all releases are done in that way it seems. Get with the program! It's time to go to a decent container. XVID and AVI are the standard. MKV is HQ. MP4 is crap."
,DreamGoddessLindsey,2012-09-30T01:27Z,"Oh, and that Pazera converter doesn't work. Registers as VIRUS. So I guess you're just an asshole trace535. Fuck you MP4 retards."
,trace535,2012-09-30T01:44Z,"DreamGoddessLindsey,

I agree that .mkv is superior to .mp4, however the xvid codec is simply inferior in every conceivable way to x264. There is just no contest.

And if your concern is that your PS3 can't decode this file, then connect a PC to your TV.

Upgrade your shit, or downgrade this x264 file down to xvid, and stop complaining."
,trace535,2012-09-30T01:48Z,"That Pazera program is NOT A VIRUS, NOR MALWARE.

What are you, stupid? Get a real antivirus, like Security Essentials."
,mercurious,2012-09-30T03:33Z,"For those bitching about containers etc... if you don't like it, then download this copy, use a conversion program to change it to the format you like, then seed it! If other people are interested in it, they'll download it. Simple huh! Either that or keep complaining about what OTHER PEOPLE ARE GIVING YOU FOR FREE, YOU SELFISH, UNAPPRECIATIVE, ARROGANT BASTARDS!! Now STFU!!
