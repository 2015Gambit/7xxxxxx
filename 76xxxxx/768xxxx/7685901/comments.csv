,Mentat81,2012-09-29T21:09Z,Thank you. Much appreciated.
,Kknewkles,2012-09-29T21:56Z,Fast release and that's all it is. I wouldn't advise to download this at all. Wait for another one with at least minimally acceptable quality.
,HelloMynameisV,2012-09-29T21:59Z,Thanx BRO! 
,NoMad17,2012-09-30T02:20Z,"I did watch, since I really wanted to, I shared back a few times already and will be deleting soon, sorry bro thanks for the upload but the top and bottom is cut off, it's a bit blurry, and there's a DVR chinga at the bottom for the first five seconds. Keep up the good fight though man, (everyone else: Why did eztv do Clone Wars and not this though? It's like, right after it.)"
,Produh,2012-09-30T02:22Z,"Hi C_P i hope you read this i have never commented on pirate bay before and i get things from you all time. And i would like to say your awesome. Please keep releasing more young justice episodes and all the other ones you do. YOU ROCK
P.S i made this account just to say this"
,NoMad17,2012-09-30T02:31Z,"Woah, nevermind about eztv, they don't cap their own stuff I guess. (I decided to visit their website, fuck if that got me the info I needed.)"
,bob9001a,2012-09-30T03:56Z,"hey look, C P still sucks balls"
,reythekid,2012-09-30T06:28Z,"smh* usually, I just sit back, smile at the stupidity of some of the people that post comments, then I download what I want, seed for a while and leave. But today I finally reset my password just to point out, that pirating is free. When you get free things you shouldn't really complain. You shouldn't beg and choose at the same time now should you? So if you really want to watch something ""HD"" instead of being assholes and freaking out because someone took their time to upload something, even if it may not be perfect quality, the fact is, they did it. 
So either pay for what you want, or do a better job, until then :/ well, feel free to shut the fuck up. "
,shitmane,2012-09-30T09:35Z,Do you have green lantern?
