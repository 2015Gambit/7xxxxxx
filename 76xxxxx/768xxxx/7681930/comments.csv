,unnim2,2012-09-29T07:45Z,is something wrong with this file? does not open. 
,GIANNIS511,2012-09-29T10:18Z,"It doesn't open at all, or is there an error note?
If anyone else has the same problem please tell me so I can delete this torrent and reupload a fixed version."
,Ogurek4,2012-09-29T15:02Z,"I also had a problem opening the file with Comicrack. I'm not too sure what the problem is but I was able to fix it. I opened the file with 7-zip and extracted the .jpg files. I then used 7-zip again to make a new .cbz file from the .jpg files. Now, it works perfectly. 

Thanks Giannis511 for the upload."
