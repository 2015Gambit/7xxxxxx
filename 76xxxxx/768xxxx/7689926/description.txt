The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the LIVE Sunday, September 30 edition of Infowars Live, Alex breaks down the series of events that have led to now 2,000 U.S. soldier deaths in Afghanistan and the snowballing acceleration towards World War III, signs pointing to the extreme likelihood of a staged "cyber attack" in the near future to invigorate Internet control legislation, California's Proposition 37 mandatory GMO labeling measure gaining speed and more. 

He'll continue to explore the crazed, delusional frenzy exemplified in the viral Obama phone video, sadly depicting an impoverished public's open welcome of chains in trade for trinkets. We'll also air our recent interview with Gary Johnson.

Note: I did not hear any part of a Gary Johnson interview. However, I did notice that, (though not mentioned in the official description) for most of hour 2, Naturopath Peter Glidden is Alex's guest to plug the products sold at infowarsteam.com and infowarshealth.com.
