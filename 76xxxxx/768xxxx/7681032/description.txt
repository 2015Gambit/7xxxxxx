Hierarchical keywords

Save time and stay on top of your growing collection by creating keyword hierarchies that span from the general to the very specific. For example, say youΓÇÖve created this structure: Transportation | Cars | Vintage. When you assign an image of a Model-T to the Vintage keyword with a check of a box, it automatically gets added to the higher keyword levels. Click on a keyword in the Catalog pane or use Quick Search to display all of the files assigned to that keyword. Create as many levels as you need to fully and accurately classify your assets.
