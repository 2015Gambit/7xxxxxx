Moonshine River

Americas favorite Midwestern family travels
to New York City in search of Barts long
lost love Mary Spuckler (guest voice Zooey
Deschanel) who he wants to reconnect with
since she has left Springfield and her
hillbilly family there to reinvent herself
in the big apple. Lisa and Marge look
forward to experiencing all the city has to
offer but when they realize their budget
wont allow a Broadway play they settle for
the free Shakespeare In the Park which
doesnt go as planned
