 The interface of the program is user-friendly and it has been designed in such a way that evryone can operate it without any problems. 
You can decorate your picture using a few instructions by means of adding to it a frame, a mask, the background, a shade or a text.
 Using all these functions and effects and taking into account the fact that we can use all the options simultaneously including the change of colour of each layer, the change of saturation and contrast, you can undoubtedly claim that each picture will be different. 
You can also design your own composition . It can be done thanks to the tools which enable us to add various elements such as figures clip-parts or striking texts. You can also calibrate pictures, so you can cut them, zoom to the view that suits you and get rid of the red-eye effect. 
Thanks to the program you can print pictures using your printer as well as you can save ready photos in high quality mode in order to send them to photo-labs.
