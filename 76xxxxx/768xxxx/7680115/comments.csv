,gianelli76,2012-09-28T08:54Z,"Silvergal, latest NY Times Bestseller torrent available anywhere is JUNE 2012.  Usually someone makes the new list or additions available every 6 weeks or so.

Anyone who can provide a current update will be hero to me.

,sparksfan,2012-09-28T13:49Z,"Thanks for the Georgette Heyer books.
Do you have any books by Meg Cabot and Kami Garcia?"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-28T14:18Z,"@tooniedog 

I checked the file in question as well as the ones in flood 22 and they all open on my side.There was another member who had the same problem with another epub file but it was his reader that wouldn't open that particular file.

If your using a desktop or Laptop download an epub reader and see if it opens the file,if it does then you know that it's your reader that won't open that certain file.Since ""Jane Feather' has been requested a few times and this is the first time I had anyone say they couldn't open the file ,I'm thinking it just might be your reader that is refusing to to open it

Thanx for the comment :)"
,Cyqua,2012-09-28T15:45Z,"As usual, you're just the best! And I feel kindda guilty asking for more :$
