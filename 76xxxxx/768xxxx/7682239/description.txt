Please Note before you download: The Hiss on the main source had a high pitch sound to it that I found off putting.
Using a new tool for noise reduction I was able to remove that. But the after effect of doing that gave the quieter
parts the wind tunnel effect. I prefer that over having the high pitched hiss sound throughout the whole show.
The Patches using the Alternate Mono - parts of those had better audio from other sources, but I used those because
they were complete patches, instead of using 3 different sources for 1 patch.

ALL credit goes to the Band and the tapers.
And to Javit who liberated the (5th) Stereo source and for allowing me to use it.
Also to blackmikito for his valuble feedback.
Remastering is just a hobby. This release is never meant to be definitive
