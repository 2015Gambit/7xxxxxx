Movies : Crime : VHS Rip : English,this is a redo of my torrent, reduced file size.
Please Note: Film not in the best condition, bumped up the bitrate a bit, the smaller the viewing size the better it looks. Watchable. I edited the opening credits which had much garble in them, it's in the source, movie is not like that, but the clarity is sadly lacking, 68mins 44secs, fun movie.

Recommended only for the die-hard fan who has never seen it!
