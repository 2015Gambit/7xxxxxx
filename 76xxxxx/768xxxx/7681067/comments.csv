,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-29T07:04Z,"thanx again pss.@vatel88 some times it takes a while to find a source for an xvid conversion + @psspss has limited data where he is so some times we have to wait but its worth it cuz he's the only one that does this show & a few others aswell.& again,thanx pss,+ 1 A/10 V/10"
[V],psspss,2012-09-29T13:19Z,"not looked about on web for it deeply but no
source of E7 as yet.. i think it clashes with other shows on at same time? and most cappers think its not greatest show so they dont bother now

i keep eye out for it but I suspect its show up when its repeated for a second chance of capture"
,vatel88,2012-09-29T17:47Z,"Cool, thanks for the info. Ya its not a good show in the least really. The host is a douche nozzle and low balls everybody. But the seeing some of the toys from your childhood can be fun. "
