,Loneryuu,2012-09-30T16:12Z,so i went back to 7... i can run the game with the update now.. but at the cost of some serious lag. before this update and while running windows 8 i could run it smoothly in the high settings. now i have lag in the very low settings. i'm using nvidia 550m with the latest drivers. what can i do to eliminate the lag? thanks in advance and sorry for the inconvenience.
,hisazul,2012-10-04T10:14Z,"Sooo... does anyone know where I might dig up a crack that doesn't crash consistently?
I'm just not in the mood to run into darksiders 2 corrupted save files and being forced to replay from start... then ending up with 40+ folders of manual backups on 3rd try just to realie that shows edge still crashes regardless of anything."
,hisazul,2012-10-04T10:16Z,"err same as darksiders 2...
I can play for an hour or even 2... but this seems to always eventually crash. dx is from this game so is vc... drivers are always up to date and meh... besides darksiders 2 skydrow craked everything and their grandmother works flawlessly.
skidrow is terrible at times..."
