Shinju no Kusari (Chain of Pearls)
The beautiful, genuine pearls we lust after belong in a chain... because that is how they bind our hearts. Hisa, the newest manager of her high school's soccer club, has a secret: a part-time job. If anyone knew, she would either have to quit the job she needs to survive or the sport that she loves. Sakyou, one of the team's most talented and anti-social members, finds out about Hisa's secret... so it's a good thing for Hisa that the handsome and high-handed Sakyou wants to keep her close to him! Or is it? (There is an additional one-shot of this story in Vol. 1 of LoveSupreme Principle)
