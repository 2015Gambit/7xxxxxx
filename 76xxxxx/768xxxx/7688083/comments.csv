I wonder why they took the promos down are the videos in the members Section? Did part 2 come out? THANKS AGIAN!!!"

I don't believe Cheeky video is in the members section yet, but BSL (Adam Deane) might tell you somethin' different just to get you to join and pocket your cash. I don't know why he pulled the promos for Cheeky, but it's clearly he fumbled the ball on the goal line and turned it over for the loss by tryin' to sit on this video."

P.S. 
I never thought these promos i ripped would be so precious."
