TNA and Spike Tv had Satellite broadcast problems during the Tara vs ODB match but unfortunetely I have no control over it and cannot fix it so this video is not perfect but its the best I can do given the circumstances.

First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 8,000 kbps from the 1920 x 1080i HD source on 09/27/2012 on the Spike TV HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite then converted to 16:9 widescreen 1280 x 720p resolution Framerate is 59.940 with an average Video Bitrate of 5,000 kbps in a High Quality 2.07 GB 720p H264 AVCHD MP4 release with 48khz 384 kbps AAC 2 channel stereo audio show runtime 1 Hour 25 minutes 25 seconds

This is my 80th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show TNA Impact wrestling fans. 

My releases are in MP4 format with AAC 2 channel stereo audio so that they are playable with VLC player as well as Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, Sony Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones, iPhone, iPad, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD MP4 video files. 

If you want this show in MKV format it is easy to convert it from MP4 to MKV using MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 (MKVmerge 2.2.0) which you can download from here:  http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/win32/mkvtoolnix-2.2.0-setup.exe

Here's how to do it:  Download and install MKVMerge (Use link above). It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.

Open MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the "Add" button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video and select it. Press "Open," and it will load into MKVMerge.

Press the "Browse" button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click "Save" to save the location. Click the "Start Muxing" button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.
