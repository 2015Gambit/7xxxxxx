There is no more thrilling outcome than the one that no one saw coming. FIFA 2013 takes the all-world football experience you expect and adds intrigue by amping up the unexpected, making each match play out with the anything-can-happen feel of real life football. Key refinements improve first-touch capabilities with more realistic physics and intensify battles for ball control with a new Player Impact Engine. The sharpened AI attack is more versatile and relentless, while a tweaked dribbling mechanic with true 360-degree mobility lets you chart a path through the defense with more precision. You'll also find more free-kick options on both sides of the ball, and much more.
