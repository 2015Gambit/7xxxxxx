===============================================

The Dark Tower is a series of books written by American 

author Stephen King, which incorporates themes from multiple 

genres, including fantasy, science fantasy, horror and western. 

It describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the 

nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. King has 

described the series as his magnum opus. Besides the eight 

novels that compose the series proper, many of King's other 

books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters 

that come into play as the series progresses. After the series 

was finished, a series of prequel comics followed.

===============================================

In the story, Roland Deschain is the last living member of a 

knightly order known as gunslingers and the last of the line of 

"Arthur Eld", his world's analogue of King Arthur. Politically 

organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares 

technological and social characteristics with the American Old 

West but is also magical. Many of the magical aspects have vanished 

from Mid-World, but traces remain as do relics from a technologically 

advanced society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled 

building said to be the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is 

said to have "moved on", and it appears to be coming apart at the 

seams. Mighty nations have been torn apart by war, entire cities and 

regions vanish without a trace and time does not flow in an orderly 

fashion. Sometimes, even the sun rises in the north and sets in the 

east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals and age are unclear, 

though later installments shed light on these mysteries.
