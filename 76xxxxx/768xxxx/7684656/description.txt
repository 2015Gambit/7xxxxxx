stars: Eugene Domingo..,About the Movie
ΓÇ£PISAYΓÇ¥, directed by Auraeus Solito, PSHS ΓÇÖ86, winner of the Best Director, Best Production Design and the Audience Choice Awards at the recently concluded Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, is a story about eight students who makes it to the premier science high school during the politically volatile 80ΓÇÖs in the Philippines. These students find the world outside, with the chaos of the end of the Marcos dictatorship erupting into the People Power revolution in 1986, being replicated within the school as they struggle to graduate, contend with teachers, classmates, family, school officials, and a new classification system to segregate students into two groups based on their academic ranking. It chronicles their journey of self discovery as they go through the joys and pains of adolescence.
