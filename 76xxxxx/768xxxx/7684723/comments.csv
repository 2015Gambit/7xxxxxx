http://thepiratebay.se/search/Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator/0/3/0
respect the original seeders as you would have others not post your exact same torrent."
,udidwht,2012-09-30T04:47Z,"^^^That would depend. If it's a game/file that was uploaded 4+ years ago it likely isn't downloadable due to not having any seeders. Then by all means please upload it so it may be passed on again.

But yes, use search first."

,aarque,2012-10-01T13:45Z,"a much, much more pertinent question would be to ask yourself, ""what makes you think I'd even care about your opinion, even if you didn't call yourself 'manhole.'"" I care more about the slightest chance of improving The Pirate Bay, that somebody may heed a sharply worded comment, than I do about your opinion of me, bummer for you. Now go find some software to upload.
 Meanwhile, you kids could give a flying fuck whether TPB lives or dies. You'll just go leech the next ""free"" thing..."
,Manhole45,2012-10-03T16:03Z,"You cry on every torrent about how they are basically ""bringing down the system"" because they aren't uploading what you want them to upload, or they tell you to fuck off.  THEN, you cry on the forums trying to get people banned over it.  It is absolutely pertinent.  Much more so than my username.

Have fun raging over every FSX torrent that you don't approve of.    

Oh, and I will continue to leech as well, thanks.

,aarque,2012-10-04T06:29Z,"...huh? Not sure what you're talking about, specially at this point. Doesn't really have much to do with this lame ass, zero seeder torrent, near as I can tell. Looks like all the leeches DID check my link..."
