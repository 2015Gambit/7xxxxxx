The beginning is missing, not by much, a couple of borders show now and again, and its overall a dark film but nothing to worry about. So i tried to bring some of the picture back by adjusting gamma, yuv, sat, brightness, contrast, it looks decent to me, but you be the judge of that. "

Overall well worth the download, totally watchable, and once someone gets a line for the audio it will make a great TS."

movie. Some might have mentioned it seems a lot like a higher budget less exciting version of The Raid."
