DJ Shadow, is rightly regarded as one of the most influential and consistently
innovative artists to emerge from music in the last 20 years, has a collection
of his finest recordings released on September 25th via UMe. Known as ""an
electronic musical pioneer and turntable mastermind"" (Pitchfork.com)
Reconstructed: The Best Of DJ Shadow will be released on one single CD and
double vinyl.

All the music is drawn from Shadow s 20-year career - from the early pre-Mo Wax
days, right up to the present and his most recent album, The Less You Know, The
Better. Perhaps most exciting to Shadow fans is the inclusion of two brand new
tracks, including the pop masterpiece Listen, featuring legendary vocalist Terry
Reid.

Josh Davis, aka DJ Shadow, changed the game in 1996 with the release of his
universally acclaimed debut album Endtroducing... Made entirely from samples,
Endtroducing... was like nothing that had come before. As the New York Times
stated, the critically acclaimed Endtroducing ... helped define the then
cutting-edge genre of instrumental hip-hop: dance music with symphonic sweep
built from scores of samples dug out of eclectic and often obscure recordings.
And TIME Magazine named it as one of 100 top albums since 1954. Sixteen years on
and it remains as potent and revered an album as it was on release. Shadow
followed up two years later by making the lion's share of the music on the 1998
U.N.K.L.E. album, Psyence Fiction, an album with James Lavelle, featuring Thom
Yorke, Ian Brown and Richard Ashcroft amongst others. By the time he released
The Private Press, 2002, Davis felt he had taken emotive instrumental music
created entirely from samples as far as it could go and the new record took
Shadow into new territories confounding those who were waiting on
Endtroducing...Part 2. The Private Press remains one of the most underrated
follow-up albums. The Outsider (2006) saw DJ Shadow making a hip-hop record
featuring some of leading exponents of the Bay Area s then burgeoning Hyphy
scene while last year s The Less You Know, the Better, was, according to
according to Stool Pigeon magazine, a testament to his enduring sampling genius"
