,kamot12,2012-09-28T10:32Z,"It's not the extended version, am I right?"
,Akhenaton666,2012-09-28T13:05Z,"Everyone is waiting for the extended cut, if someone could verify wether this is it or not would be great, thanks."
,Efreak15,2012-09-28T15:55Z,"@There is no extended cut.  Like the Avengers, the extra are uploaded separately.  If you want the extras, here's the torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7681459/Prometheus.2012.EXTRAS.720p.BluRay.x264-PublicHD"
,kamot12,2012-09-28T17:22Z,Thanks Efreak. Didn't know about Avengers extras either.
,topk,2012-09-28T17:24Z,"BOZX, what is the difference between this one and your other Prometheus - the 3.4 GB one, other than the DTS audio? The resolution and source seems to be the same?"
,Efreak15,2012-09-28T20:50Z,"@topk
The other source was directly from itunes.  This one is directly from the retail blueray so it has much better audio, and maybe a little better video."
,.Leto.,2012-09-29T02:51Z,"Amazing movie. I just finished watching it, no idea why some people were disappointed with it. I guess they were expecting to see an action or horror movie with aliens chasing people? Great science-fiction movie, totally fascinating."
,enonumus,2012-09-29T08:16Z,"Thanks for the upload!  A10/V10/M6

@Leto - To answer your question/comment, rather than start a diatribe listing all of the ridiculously unrealistic actions of the crew in this movie, I would just suggest you read some of the comments on IMDB.  This is one of those movies that had a lot more potential than it actually delivered, primarily due to a poor script.  It's tempting to want to list some of the absurdities but I'll restrain myself."
,.Leto.,2012-09-29T15:22Z,"lol? why would I need to read the imdb comments? why should I care about other people's opinion? I certainly don't need someone else to tell me whether a movie is good or not. I enjoyed this movie, that's the only thing that matters."
,SiN4,2012-09-29T16:56Z,Just finished downloading thanks :) idk about the movie but the AMIABLE releases never go wrong
,the_darkmaster,2012-09-29T18:02Z,"Thanks, finally a PROPER 1080p version. I wonder why others insist on trying to fool the others with 720p upscaled to 1080p."
,the_darkmaster,2012-09-29T18:03Z,"damn, ignore my last comment, wrong title"

""This is one of those movies that had a lot more potential than it actually delivered, primarily due to a poor script.""

Considering you seem to be an expert on screenwriting, please indulge us with your improvements on the script - I am dying to know what you would have done differently."
,SiN4,2012-10-01T01:12Z,"Finally watched it, great quality as always for an AMIABLE release, and the movie is fine, i really don't see why some people say it's a shitty movie, i liked it more than avengers for sure.

although i recommend you to download the 1080p version, this one worth watching it in great quality. "
