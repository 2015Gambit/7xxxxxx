Several books about Schmitt are also included, with the caution that as most of academia is extremely hostile to Schmitt's way of thinking, the literature on him can be highly misleading, either because it tries to present him as a devil to be opposed, or (especially in more recent literature) because it tries to neutralize him by cleverly misreading him, and thereby enlist him into a political project which he would have abhorred.  Make sure to read and ponder the real Schmitt - don't be fooled by either the devil-Schmitt or the sanitized-Schmitt.
