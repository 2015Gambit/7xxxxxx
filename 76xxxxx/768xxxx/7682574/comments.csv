,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-29T07:13Z,"great as always man.I watched the last one you up'd & I was thinking...maybe it should have been an IFO bundle,LOL.I mean,it was mostly about comets & the like.still,very informative thou.its got my pick for 2012 (or maybe 2013?) end of the world"
[V],psspss,2012-09-29T10:54Z,"no comets and unknown objects are UFOs too

until like most things can be found out what it was then its a IFO identified

theres the main opentvs one in each bundle with UFO events and sightings then a chat though

the next one will have the best sightings for Sept"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-30T08:10Z,I guess we won't see eye to eye on that one.to me a UFO is something we can't identify because we don't know what it is.we know what comets & meteors are so even if we can't see some of them yet we can identify them when we do see them.
