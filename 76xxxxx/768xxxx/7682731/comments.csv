[H],HeroMaster,2012-09-28T21:02Z,ENJOY Pusher 2012 HDRIP New Movie by AXED The AXE Gang of P2P!
,Buccaneer650,2012-09-28T22:52Z,"Holy shit - he remade it! 

The original is seriously fucking ace - the movie best depiction of someone who does not consider consequences... ever.

Pusher 2 is dynamite too and a definite progression and a extra heap of humour added, with Pusher 3 taking a darker more understated path, yet still brutally realistic.

I have a feeling I will enjoy the director's own remake having loved the uber stylish Drive.

Thanks for sharing.

We shall see..."
,Buccaneer650,2012-09-28T23:10Z,"Here is the original, along with the two sequels. If the subtitles don't work just make sure they are in the same folder as the movie file and have the same name... e.g. Pusher1.avi needs subtitles to be called Pusher1.srt - that's what VLC seems to like best, as does my Sumvision media player.
