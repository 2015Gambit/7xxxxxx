Savage wins historic legal battle against radio syndicator



'Top names in business' already inquiring about taking his show




Top-rated talk-radio host Michael Savage announced today he has won his legal battle to free himself from his syndicator, the Talk Radio Network, and can negotiate with a new network.

He said he ΓÇ£will not be heard on the radio for some timeΓÇ¥ but will continue to update his website and produce a free daily newsletter.

As WND reported, Savage sued TRN in December 2010 regarding his contract, alleging the network used ΓÇ£illegal and unenforceable contract provisionsΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£other strong-armed tacticsΓÇ¥ to intimidate him and force him into accepting a ΓÇ£sub-standard agreement.ΓÇ¥

The federal case was referred to arbitration.

SavageΓÇÖs lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, told WND that Savage was awarded money damages and ΓÇ£complete freedomΓÇ¥ from TRN. He declined to disclose the amount but said it was seven figures.

Savage has been given ownership of his show, according to Horowitz, which means he will be off the air until he signs a contract with a new syndicator.

ΓÇ£Within an hour of knowing he was free, we were already talking to top names in the business,ΓÇ¥ Horowitz said.

WND contacted TRN, but a staffer said no one in a position to comment was available.
