,Hatiloou,2012-09-28T17:36Z,I'm pretty interested how the graphics are :D
,FSMD80,2012-09-28T18:17Z,Enter zero's for serial
,FSMD80,2012-09-28T18:20Z,Graphics are like FS 5.0 and FS 5.1. Not that great. This is simply a vintage version of flight simulator. I like this because you can run it in windows without having to use Dosbox.
,FSMD80,2012-09-28T18:36Z,Enter all ZERO's for the serial.
