"Roy's Wedding"

The wedding toast of Pam's ex-fiance Roy 
causes Pam and Jim to examine their 
relationship for buried secrets. Dwight 
stubbornly protests Nellie's mandatory 
charity initiative by supporting the Taliban 
and agreeing to live by their severe laws. 
Clark hits on Erin by dangling a fake 
newscaster job; Andy also takes the bait.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
