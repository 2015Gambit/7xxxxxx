Review

Released on drummer Paal Nilssen-Love's own PNL label, the trio further
consists of Sten Sandell on piano and Johan Berthling on bass. Recorded live in
Japan in 2008, the album consists of two tracks: "Face Up", and "Face Down",
for twice more than half an hour of quite intense musical explorations. The
first track is a high energy work-out, the second starts with counter-rhythmic
percussion, full of explosive power and creativity, Berthling joins on bass,
first plucked, and when Sandell joins he moves to arco, while the pianist plays
some eery chords, gradually driving up the tempo and energy level for again a
dense improvisation, that suddenly collapses for some minimalist interaction,
with all three musicians exploring the more uncommon aspects of their
instruments. In stark contrast to some of the other albums below, the album
demonstrates that technical mastery and musical vision make it possible to
bring depth and emotional drive even with the most common of all jazz line-ups.
