TED (www.ted.com) is a annual academy about the most important and moving topics of today, with a host of lectures from all over the world and all professions, talking about their work with enthusiasm and empathy. 
Their talks are published on www.ted.com, and some of them are converted to audio by TED. But not all. Since this is the best kind of entertainment where you can learn a lot and get to know new worlds and visions, I wanted to have those talks portable on my mp3 player and converted the videos to audio only. This works for about 90% of the talks which don't need the visuals.
