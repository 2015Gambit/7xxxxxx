Supported GPU list
RECOMMENDED CARDS:
For ideal performance we recommend at least
a Geforce 285 or ATI 3870 with 1GB of VRAM.
C4D FILE SUPPORT:
Requires Cinema 4D R12 and newer to import inside Element.
RENDER FARM SUPPORT?
It is possible to use Element on a network render farm but we do not recommend it because of inconsistencies in GPU rendering. Since Element renders with impressive speed on a single GPU it is ideal to pre-render any 3D elements before pushing to the render farm
