,SilentViper01,2012-09-29T13:54Z,When will update 2 come? And Ghostnet thanks for the upload do u know if this solve the save bug?
,RECa5T,2012-09-29T15:45Z,Tnx mate:) but we need update #2 to solve save bug :(
,JvMr333,2012-09-29T16:53Z,"Yeah, save fix comes in patch #2.

A temp fix that works (for many atleast) from CM:

1. Select Multiplayer -> Split Screen -> Press Start on a second controller / keyboard -> P1: Select any team & driver -> P2: Select any team & driver -> Any Race Settings -> Any track.
2. Once on track P1 pause and select Options -> Driving Controls and change Control Profile to another option and then back again. Exit back out of the Pause menu.
3. P2 pause and select Options -> Driving Controls and change Control Profile to another option and then back again. Back out to Pause Options, select Quit To Main Menu -> Yes.
4. You should now be able to save again.

Should really buy this game if you like it, after I saw they fixed the save thingy and multiple other stuff, I bought it.. Easily worth the 26â&#x201A;Ź I paid."
,otbopk0,2012-09-29T18:51Z,"I tried the save workaround but when I go to ""Split screen"", it says something with ""press start button"" but the only active option I have is ""Cancel"".... I even bought a gamepad especially for this but even with the gamepad's start button it won't work. Any ideas? Or I should just wait for the second patch :-)"
,MrYolaah,2012-09-29T23:34Z,"Useless patch just fucked all shadows in game!
and yes JvMr333, game worth 26 #â&#x201A;Ź -even more 100 maybe,
but i dont have that money."
,Redbrpt,2012-09-30T01:18Z,"It was working, until I installed this mafaking update. Now it doesn't even starts."
,otbopk0,2012-10-03T12:56Z,"Thanks, it works fine here, but do you have any idea as to when you will be able to crack and upload update 2?"
,JJ_,2012-10-03T13:06Z,there are 3 updates available and fourth one is coming.
,otbopk0,2012-10-03T16:23Z,"JJ do you know where we can download them? I mean, apart from Steam :-)"
,JJ_,2012-10-04T12:02Z,No I don't.
,philoz494,2012-10-04T13:35Z,Patch #4 is already released. What could take so long to release the second one here?
,grimm862,2012-10-04T16:06Z,"It takes time, if you want the patches now then pay the 60 dollars. :D"
