"Moonshine River"

Americas favorite Midwestern family travels 
to New York City in search of Barts long-
lost love Mary Spuckler (guest voice Zooey 
Deschanel) who he wants to reconnect with 
since she has left Springfield and her 
hillbilly family there to reinvent herself 
in the big apple. Lisa and Marge look 
forward to experiencing all the city has to 
offer but when they realize their budget 
wont allow a Broadway play they settle for 
the free Shakespeare In the Park which 
doesnt go as planned.
