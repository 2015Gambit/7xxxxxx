OTHER INFO:

DVD-9 discs are one-sided, double layer recordable DVDs with a capacity of 8.5GB. The numbering after DVDs can be approximated to the capacity of the discs. For example DVD-5 discs can hold 4.7GB on a one-sided, single layer disc and DVD-18 can hold 17.4GB on a dual-side, dual-layer disc.

In double layer (also referred to as dual layer) DVD-9 discs, two layers of standard DVD-5 are joined together with a transparent spacer and a thin reflector between the two. The bottom layer is read and written to in exactly the same manner as DVD-5. Reading and writing to the second layer is achieved by the laser focusing a fraction of a millimeter beyond the first recording layer.
