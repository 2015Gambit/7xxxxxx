,Chiitah,2012-10-03T21:22Z,"iEvora : That goes for all games that exist so doesn't really need to be said does it?  If you like a game you should always pay for it.  If you don't usually pay for games than no there is no special reason to pay for this one and rip off all the rest just because it's an ""indie"" title.  No offense but I do take offense to people who pirate the crap out of everything and then come and whine and beg people to buy the game that they personally want to support.  Be a Pirate or don't, but don't be a hypocrite about it :D"
,DMX8989,2012-10-04T06:27Z,So no answer for me ? Please help me : /
