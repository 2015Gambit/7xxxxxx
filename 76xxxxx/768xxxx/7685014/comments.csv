,bordo84,2012-09-29T16:22Z,"thanks...but 12,6 Mbps is enough? i expected at least 14 but nevermind i hope dark scenes are allright too"
,phase700b,2012-09-30T03:45Z,"Yeah, All the other versions have posterization in dark scenes. Hope this one is better."
,bordo84,2012-09-30T12:38Z,so it´s posterization..hmm...i read about this...so that´s why a lot of releases have grey colour and colorless errors in dark scenes because it´s downgrading a colour
,bordo84,2012-09-30T12:58Z,but why they use it? i don t get it
,phase700b,2012-09-30T16:52Z,"It's not something they intentionally add. It's an effect that can be caused by compression. This movie seems to show it more than some others. This copy looks better to me than a couple others I've seen. I just checked some of the dark scenes on a 92"" screen. This one has 2 commentary tracks also."
,bordo84,2012-09-30T17:57Z,aaha...ok now i understand...thanks for info..and i believe this copy looks better because hdchina is assurance of quality at least till now...i don´t understand why bad releases have always more seeders than releases like this one...blow and badje releases are shits with errors...and we have it another copy from hdmaniac with the same bitrate :D really don´t understand what´s the point to make exactly the same copy
,bordo84,2012-10-01T11:04Z,so this copy i can´t play on my hardisk through tv i don t know why :(
,phase700b,2012-10-01T14:31Z,"This one did seem to load a little slow. I ran it through MKVtoolnix. That fixed it. You can remove extra subs, add your own or a lot of other things with this tool. It's free and you don't have to modify the file. You can just run a copy of a movie through it to straighten out a glitch or play back problem. Usually works. http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html"
,bordo84,2012-10-03T14:09Z,man thank you sooooo much i´m gonna try it....it seems though there is a part from 8:30 minute of movie which you can´t compress otherwise it´s going slower...when i tried to play remux on pc that part runs the same way the whole movie runs but when you tried that on hdchina release and amiable pc and bluray had a problem with this part and thanks for that program i also have a remux from exdt so i try this with that release too...one more time thanks a lot!!
,bordo84,2012-10-03T16:54Z,so it doesnt´work for me :( i tried that remux exdt i just let there english audio and czech subtitles removed chapters also and started muxing but it´s still the same :(
,bordo84,2012-10-04T13:43Z,why the hell everybody uses header stripping is useless save just 1 percent of space and that´s all and then you can´t play that on standalone players i wish i knew where i can write this so they could just stop doing that...
