Larry Coryell Discography

There's no need to spend many words for one the masters of the jazz fusion guitar...

I only remember when I saw him live years ago in a live concert together with Paco De Lucia and Al Di Meola.
At that time I didnt know him and for me he was only a name here and there in some jazz album.
But when I saw the trio performing... I saw De Lucia playing in a sort of compulsive manner (a jazz musician, some friend of mine, told me that Paco's always obsessively fingering the guitar, even when he's not performing). Di Meola was also perfect but equally tight as a tourniquet in the transmission of feelings - he seemed also slightly annoyed of the fans studying his technique under the stage.
On the other hand, the third unknown grey-haired, bespectacled man was there, playing and irradiating a pulse of warmth and energy.
And he smiled as if he was doing something he really loved...
So for me Coryell was a matter of serendipity... :)

You will find here 118 albums, solo and collaborations (a big thanks to Crimhead420 who kindly provided me some very rare albums, difficult to find anywhere else :) )
All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.

Enjoy :)
