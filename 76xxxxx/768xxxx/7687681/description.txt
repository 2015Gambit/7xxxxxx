Pulled together from the remnants of two amateur Liverpool bands, the Mavericks & the Pacifics, the Merseybeats are still active these days. This new Merseybeats anthology, for the very first time, boasts all 31 tracks the band ever recorded on a single CD. Included are classic early works such as 'Fortune Teller' & 'Mister Moonlight,' UK chart successes like 'I Think Of You,' 'It's Love That Really Counts,' and even a couple of highly sought-after German-language ditties.
