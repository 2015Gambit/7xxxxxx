 The Simpsons are going to New York City (again) after Bart discovers that, out of all of the female interests he's had (such as Gina the juvenile delinquent, Jenny the nursing home volunteer, Darcy the pregnant preteen, and Nikki, the fourth grade girl who flip-flopped between loving and hating him), the only one who liked him was Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel's daughter, Mary (as seen in "Apocalypse Cow"), and now that Mary's made it to the Big Apple, Bart wants to see her again.
