Two best friends, Peco and Smile, have been playing ping pong since they were little kids. 
While Peco plays to win and completely loves the sport, Smile only plays because he looks up 
to Peco and does it to kill time with his friend (even though he obviously has the potential to 
being one of the best players around).

 Famous for his madcap, screwy style, Taiyo Matsumoto's manga of the same name became a hit 
with readers as it explored the world of ping pong like never before. And the film adaptation by 
Masuri is no different. PING PONG analyzes the spirituality of competition and inter-personal 
relationships between team players and rivals. To them, ping pong was their livelihood and 
they only knew the color of their blood when it stained the handles of their paddles. Even in the 
context of the fantastic, surreal attitude of the film, the characters come to life through their 
determinations and ambitions.

While one might mistakenly compare PING PONG to many other extreme sports films, it just isn't 
so. For example, SHAOLIN SOCCER uses CENTRO DIGITAL'S artistry to paint and overwhelm the 
picture with beautiful, dynamic action, but for PING PONG'S dreamlike atmosphere, CG is used 
intermittently throughout, but is extremely subtle in execution, ranging from dragonflies over 
ping pong tables, butterfly wings on a character or even the rapid fast ping pong balls zipping 
back and forth in mid matches. It is this delicate and faint styling that gives PING PONG its edge.
