,2HardRain,2012-09-28T09:09Z,"But this is not real 1080p!!! (SARCASM).

,Leiss,2012-09-28T11:08Z,"What version is this, is it the one showed in theaters or is it the extended one? "
,stone2111,2012-09-28T11:16Z,"Which one is better?
Prometheus.2012.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-BRADJE [PublicHD]
or this one?"
,charlene17,2012-09-28T13:12Z,is this cinavia free ?
,charlene17,2012-09-28T13:24Z,Why is this in .rar format and is it cinavia free ?
,mauro_cod4,2012-09-28T14:31Z,Does anyone knows the Video Bitrate for this one...I have th BRADJE release and i would like to compare! 
,Efreak15,2012-09-28T15:57Z,@mauro_cod4 The Bradje encode was upscaled from the webdl.  This one is almost certainly better because its from the Retail Blueray.
,.Leto.,2012-09-29T02:54Z,"Amazing movie. I just finished watching it, no idea why some people were disappointed with it. I guess they were expecting to see an action or horror movie with aliens chasing people? Great science-fiction movie, totally fascinating. "
,rax369,2012-09-29T04:23Z,"@Efreak15: Thanks for clarifying, I was wondering the same between both releases. :D"
,stone2111,2012-09-29T08:53Z,"8814kps=Prometheus.2012.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-BRADJE [PublicHD]
8605kps=Prometheus.2012.1080p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE

Hopefully AMIABLE is better even tho slightly lower bit rate."
,the_darkmaster,2012-09-29T18:04Z,"Thanks, finally a PROPER 1080p version. I wonder why others insist on trying to fool the others with 720p upscaled to 1080p. "
,rax369,2012-09-30T04:03Z,"Question... from around 00:08:30 a distortion in the video appears (normal I know), anyone else out there having problems like me when trying to play that part from players for HDTV ????"
,bordo84,2012-09-30T11:42Z,"rax369
you´re not the only one!! i´m surprised nobody didn´t write it here before you did....it´s a big distortion image and sound are damaged and chopping untill that scene doesn´t end...it´s bad encode i think...hdchina is better in my opinion...i´m downloading that...also this bitrate from amiable is too low"
,bordo84,2012-09-30T11:50Z,also when you try to play it on computer video gets totally slow
,kow626,2012-10-03T22:43Z,"a/10

thanks"
