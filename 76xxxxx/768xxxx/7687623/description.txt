Wikipedia Says:
"Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit" is a song written by British songwriters Simon Tauber and Steve Rodway, and performed by Australian singer Gina G. Released as a single on 25 March 1996, it reached number one in the United Kingdom on 19 May 1996.

The song was the United Kingdom's entry in the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest. Although the song only finished in eighth place in the contest it was successful in Europe. The song was also successful in the United States, a rarity for Eurovision entries, peaking at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, #13 on the Rhythmic Top 40, #5 on the Mainstream Top 40, #25 on the Adult Top 40 and #11 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart.
The single still holds the record for being the last UK number one as a Eurovision entry for that country.

The song was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 1998.
