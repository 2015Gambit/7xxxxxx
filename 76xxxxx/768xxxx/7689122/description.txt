Future Earth 
Future Earth is a documentary TV series about human impacts on the environment.


1)  2025 
Future Earth 2025 takes us on an extraordinary CGI journey into the future offering a vision of what the world might be like if we continue to deplete one of our primary resources - water. Los Angeles consumed by raging firestorms, Rome under attack from billons of locusts, Washington DC flooded, massive dust storms engulfing Las Vegas, nations suffering drought as rivers dry up, forcing conflicts over water. Just the stuff of apocalyptic Hollywood movies?
It's estimated the world's ever growing population will need 50% more water in the next 20 years. Future Earth 2025 creates credible disaster scenarios based on changing weather and rain patterns, and uses the testimony of world leading scientists and engineers to project the future, and explore how these disasters can be diverted by adopting new technologies and making changes to the way we live.
