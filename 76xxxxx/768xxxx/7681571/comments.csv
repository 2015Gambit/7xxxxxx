,thxforthehelp2,2012-09-28T22:38Z,well I played up till after the second island and it DOES work as to be expected from extremezone but the game itself is pretty bad to me the FPS portion is terribad and the RTS game is just as bad because the AI is horrific too all in all I would say 4/10 its playable but I wouldn't. Thanks for the upload extremezone!

,BarbaricGoose,2012-09-29T05:33Z,"I block the program with my firewall, but it doesn't work. Every time I try to start it, I'm presented with a screen telling me to enter a CD-key. I've tried it with both the windows firewall, and then after installing a 3rd party firewall with that, and it still didn't work.

I install the game, I copy over the cracked exe, I apply the patch, etc, doesn't work. I've tried with & without the new crack, and nothing works. I've tried running the game without an internet connection, I've tried running it with super restrictive firewall settings (obviously in addition to having blocked the exe) and nothing works.

Where am I fucking this up, exactly?"
