Okay guys, this is my collection of Deadmau5 music i gathered, and i fixed it up as much as i could, so it would be perfect as i can make it be. Anyway these are all the albums, singles, ep's from Deadmau5, at highest quality available. The EP's and singles not included here are those which anyway are contained in different albums in this discography, so there was no point of duplicating, though you gonna find some duplicates, oh well they were on different albums so this is your problem now.
