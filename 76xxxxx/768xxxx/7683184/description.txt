Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, September 28 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex explores the delusional sheep mentality and naivety of Obama fanatics as they gush over the handing out free phones to the poor. 

He'll also break down exactly why the TSA is forced to lie about their policies, defending their "freeze" commands as preceded by notification, when in fact they are not. 

Alex also covers the meaning behind Netanyahu's cartoon-like drawing of what he thinks is the time table for intervention in Iran's nuclear program. 

On today's program, Alex welcomes three-time Emmy award-winning journalist, photographer, and former CNN reporter Amber Lyon to discuss the brazenly false stories CNN forced her to report.
