took over his lands. Now the time has come for Lessa to 

shed her disguiseΓÇöand take back her stolen birthright. 

But everything changes when she meets a queen dragon. 

The bond they share will be deep and last forever. It 

will protect them when, for the first time in centuries, 

LessaΓÇÖs world is threatened by Thread, an evil substance 

that falls like rain and destroys everything it touches. 

Dragons and their Riders once protected the planet from

Now brave Lessa must risk her life, and the life of her 

beloved dragon, to save her beautiful world. . . .
