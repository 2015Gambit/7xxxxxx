Judas's Note:

This movie in many places on the blu-ray itself... shows considerable grain and color banding... regardless of the filters I have attempted to apply to see if I could "improve it" over the blu-ray's own frame by frame appearance, it ended up wasting time. 	It's most noticeable in dark conditions, It's NOT the encoding, it's the way the blu-ray itself is, just a bad mass production/transfer.
