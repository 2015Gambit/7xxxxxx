,jags87,2012-09-30T01:23Z,Is this the US version and does it have hard subtitles in the first Black Widow scene? Thanks.

this is encoded from region A blu-ray, it does not have hardcoded subs anywhere (which are awful). there is an english subtitle track for only the non-english parts, or one for the entire film."
,valizio007,2012-09-30T07:12Z,"Actually this was encoded by saboo at HDbits on 25th august (Check header creation date in the MKV if you dont believe me) 

Source is the russian HDClub BD. This is not encoded from region A BD.

I dont know why uploaders try to hide information about their uploads.

you are correct, i did not even look at the nfo before saying that. btw the nfo is in the description, you will never see me hiding anything ;) no hardcorded subs though, that i'm certain of."
