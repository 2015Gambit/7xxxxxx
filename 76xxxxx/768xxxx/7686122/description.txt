In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews Rob Kirby from KirbyAnalytics.com. He talks about the role of derivatives in creating and sustaining the ongoing financial crisis. Rob Kirby received his post secondary education at York University [Economics] in Toronto. Upon completion he worked on an institutional trading desk for most of the 1980s and right up until 1996. Mr. Kirby began writing in 1997 and was involved in a number of entrepreneurial pursuits. In 2002, he went to work for Investor's Group, the largest Mutual Fund Company in Canada until September '04 when he resigned to write about the markets.
