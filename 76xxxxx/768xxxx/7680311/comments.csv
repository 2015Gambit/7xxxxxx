,hawkesk57,2012-09-28T14:50Z,Watching this episode is like having sex with your ex-wife - it only reminds you of why you left in the first place!

,-WallpaperZ-,2012-09-28T17:33Z,"This show has turned from bad to worse after having experienced the torture of watching this episode..its not even a guys show anymore..its turned into a fucking soppy love story that will end up having the majority of viewers that are women.

Wow Chuck, you've completely fucked this show. It would have been better just to end it when Sheen left you. I can seriously put this in the category of being axed after this season."
