For those that already have part 1, you know what this is, part 2 of course ! This installment has a little over 2,800 Sci-Fi & Fantasy books in it this round, bringing the total up to 5,008 if you got part 1 already ;) 

There are 73 authors in this batch, 3 of which are in the multi author category ( Warhammer, Star Trek and Xanth ) which same as last run I changed all authors names to the series name for easier filing, and same as last time all are sub categorized so all books will appear in exact reading order if they are in a series, no guess work needed.
Two parts left to go ( to get the total to 10,000 book's ) , but gonna take a breather so part 3 I should get out to you guys in around 3-4 week's, as always, happy reading, and enjoy ;)
