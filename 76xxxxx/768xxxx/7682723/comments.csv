,simmydu,2012-09-29T05:29Z,It doesn't work. I used the updater and then copied the file over into the install directory but when I try and open it just opens up the product activation where I have to put in a serial key to register the game.

,Sivos,2012-10-03T18:08Z,"@LSD I got the virus warning too, but it's not a virus.  It just sees this file as a foreign file with the same code as a virus, but it's not a virus.  Just enable it through your antivirus program."
