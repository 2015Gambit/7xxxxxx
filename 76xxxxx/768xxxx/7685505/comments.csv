,Jiraya_90,2012-09-30T14:03Z,Great upload thanks for your effort Dibya..just a question to all the followers here..this is not the first time I notice this..when the characters start to speak I see a bit of delay on the movements of the mouths following the voices..like the sound comes a bit earlier (500ms) than it should..is it just me? Is it a conversion effect or is the show like that? :)
