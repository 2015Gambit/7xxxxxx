The Football League Show 29.09.2012

Manish Bhasin presents all the action from the Football League.

It has been all change at the Molineux Stadium since Wolverhampton Wanderers' relegation in May; new manager Stale Solbakken's remodelled side are beginning to find their feet, and this week the Old Gold meet newly-promoted Sheffield Wednesday.

Cardiff, meanwhile, take on early season pacesetters Blackpool; and Charlton entertain Steve Kean's Blackburn side, who continue to defy the doomsayers.
