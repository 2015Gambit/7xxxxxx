Richard Dolan - Worlds Above and Below ╟Ç How A Secret Civilization Broke Away From Our Own.
One thing that a study of the UFO makes abundantly clear: someone is operating technology that is not supposed to exist, and yet it does. Silent craft, for example, that can instantly accelerate, many of which are said to be of non-human origin, but others which are argued to be of classified manufacture. Is there a clandestine infrastructure that has made significant breakthroughs, but which has kept them secret from the rest of us? Richard Dolan answers in the affirmative. He argues that the UFO phenomenon is infinitely more complex than many have previously suggested, and that human and non-human groups are behind what we call UFOs.

Within the human, classified part, breakthroughs have leap-frogged over each other to produce a society with substantially more advanced scientific, technological, and cosmological ideas ΓÇö a society that can accurately be called a ΓÇ£breakaway civilization.ΓÇ¥ This covert civilization has continued to interact with our own ΓÇ£officialΓÇ¥ society, but at the same time appears to have interactions or encounters with one or more of the non-human groups that are here on Planet Earth. The result is a clandestine cold war, very possibly with multiple human and non-human factions.

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
