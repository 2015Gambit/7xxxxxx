Gangs of Wasseypur 2 | 2012 | DVDRip | DDR | Phantom

Gangs of Wasseypur Part 2 is an Indian crime film co-written, produced and directed by Anurag Kashyap. It is the second instalment of the Gangs of Wasseypur series centered around Power Struggles, Politics and Vengeance among three crime families. Part two features an ensemble cast with Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chadda, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Pankaj Tripathi, Raj Kumar Yadav, Huma Qureshi and Zeishan Quadri in the major roles and its story spans from the 1990s to 2009.

The sequels were originally shot as a single film measuring a total of 318 minutes and screened at the 2012 Cannes Directors' Fortnight but since no Indian theatre would volunteer to screen a five plus hour movie, it was divided into two parts (159 mins and 158 mins respectively) for the Indian Market.

The film received an Adults Only certification from the Indian Censor Board but is still unusually explicit for Indian standards as it contained authentic lingo and violence generally suppressed by Mainstream IndianThe films soundtrack is heavily influenced by traditional Indian folk songs tending to be philosophical and liberal with its heavy use of sexual innuendos.

Part two was released on Aug 08, 2012 across India.
