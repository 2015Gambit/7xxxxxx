A History of Ottoman Architecture"" gives a clear and concise description of the history of the architecture produced under the Ottoman Empire, focusing on the extant buildings in the Republic of Turkey, particularly those in Istanbul and the empire's earlier capitals in Bursa and Edirne. The monuments in each chapter are described in chronological order, with photographs of each of them (sometimes in old prints showing them as they were in times past), along with images showing their plan and elevation. No other book on the history of Ottoman architecture is so richly illustrated, allowing the reader to see at a glance how Ottoman architecture evolved during the pre- classical, classical, baroque, and early modern periods. The book begins with a brief history of the Ottoman Empire, followed by an outline of the main features of Ottoman architecture and its decoration, then a brief biography of the great Ottoman architect Sinan. Successive chapters follow the development of Ottoman architecture from 1453 until 1923.
