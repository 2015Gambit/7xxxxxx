,wonderwang,2012-09-28T04:13Z,"The criminals who work for what used to be ACORN have been collecting names from headstones in the cemeteries to make sure the dead get their vote.  That's why democrats oppose photo ID's at the polling place.  You need a photo ID to get welfare , food stamps and even get into a courthouse....you SHOULD have it to prove you are who you claim at the voting booth."
,Vikingman1111,2012-09-28T05:42Z,This is such idiotic right wing trash. A junk book like this isn't good enough for toilet paper.
,drrckdmc,2012-09-28T08:08Z,Great work. Don't worry about the hater's. They need to take off the blinders so the can see what's in front 0f their face. They are so brain washed that they can't think for themselves but just repeat what they hear from the lame stream media.
,drrckdmc,2012-09-28T08:10Z,Vikingman last I heard you left wingers don't use toilet paper so you can help environment. See thats self thinking and originality.
,pusslicker,2012-09-28T12:12Z,How come Romney is acting like he is getting his ass kicked if the polls are really skewed toward Obama? Shouldn't his internal polls be telling him he is up by 8 points? Wouldn't he just shut his mouth and coast? Left wingers don't use toilet paper and right wingers don't have teeth. So what?

WASHINGTON â&#x20AC;&#x201D; Florida elections officials said Friday that at least 10 counties have identified suspicious and possibly fraudulent voter registration forms turned in by a firm working for the Republican Party of Florida, which has filed an election fraud complaint with the state Division of Elections against its one-time consultant.

,falafelface,2012-09-30T17:16Z,"there's been something like 10 cases of people actually BOTHERING to ACTUALLY cast a fraudulent vote at a polling place in the past 12 years.

GOP and Rightwingers are hilarious. When THEY win an election, its all good.. they do what they want. When a democrat is elected, they start shrieking revolution...well, sedition actually.

Hope they do and we can all laugh as they get their heads blown off by the cops and military.

With rightwingers gone, this country can progress out of the dark ages"
,falafelface,2012-09-30T17:21Z,Rightwingers should be fixing the holes in their heads
