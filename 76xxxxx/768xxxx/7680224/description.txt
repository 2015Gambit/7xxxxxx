
For its part, the mainstream media has done a thorough job covering RomneyΓÇÖs past, including tracing his familyΓÇÖs history all the way back to their Mexican roots, his father having once been on public aid, and the personal lifestyles of Mitt, his wife Anne, and their five sons.

But where was the mainstream media on ObamaΓÇÖs family history and professional career? Did you know that his grandparents deliberately moved to Mercer Island, Washington so that they could enroll his mother into the only openly Marxist school in America? Did you know that communist radical Frank Marshall Davis was chosen by his grandfather to be his political mentor? Did you know that he hasnΓÇÖt released any of his personal records from his college transcripts to the list of legal clients he represented when he was practicing law?


These arenΓÇÖt rumors, these are facts. Did it really take an independent documentary by an academic scholar to reveal this to the general public?

If the media is going to question RomneyΓÇÖs past, political views and ΓÇ£lack of transparencyΓÇ¥ in the national spotlight, I feel it is only fair that they do the same for Obama. But nothing short of a miracle would ever make that happen.
