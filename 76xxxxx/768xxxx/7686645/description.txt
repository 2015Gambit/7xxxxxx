Once a year, Iranians pour out their soul in reverence for a martyred saint. But young people pour out their souls in a different way - taking advantage of the fevered atmosphere to engage in trysts and assignations.

I have heard that Iranian girls wear punk bling underneath their dark chadors; watching this movie, I can well believe it. Maryam Keshavarz shows us the emotional time which is Holy Week, and how it affects young people in particular.

Dedicated to the unquenchable spirit of the Iranian people - I am sorry everybody is being so horrible to them at the moment.
