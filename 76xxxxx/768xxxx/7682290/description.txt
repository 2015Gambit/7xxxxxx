Accidentally deleted your files? GetDataBack Data Recovery can track them down--for a price. It even works with corrupted drives and those not recognized by Windows. This version only recovers files from NTFS drives, but it does offer a search tool for quickly locating a file by its date, name, or size.

If you suspect your actual disk is about to bite the dust, you can create a drive image to use during recovery. The utility can't make rescue discs, however, so if you want to do that, you'll need to build yourself a bootable Windows PE disc and add GetDataBack Data Recovery to it--the publisher's Web site has instructions.

Although the application proves quite adept at locating deleted files, and you can view their contents, the demo won't recover them. We can't vouch for how well this core feature works. GetDataBack Data Recovery seems worth trying, but if you actually want to recover any lost work, this demo won't do you much good.
