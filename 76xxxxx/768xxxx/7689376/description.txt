        "Because the Night" is the title of a song first released by the Patti Smith Group, and co-written by Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen, which was released as a single in 1978, taken from Smith's album Easter. The song was a hit, rising to #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song remains one of the best known of Smith's catalog. In 1987, Smith's recording of the song was ranked number 116 on NME magazine's list of "The Top 150 Singles of All Time". The song was originally recorded by Bruce Springsteen during sessions for his "Darkness on the Edge of Town" album. He was not satisfied with it; the Patti Smith Group was working on Easter in the studio next door, with engineer/producer Jimmy Iovine working on both albums. Jimmy gave Smith a tape of the song, she recast it, and it was included on Easter, becoming the first single released from that album. Though it was never released on any of Springsteen's studio albums, in concert beginning with his "Darkness Tour" Springsteen would often perform the song with his own lyrics. The song was first performed live (with Patti Smith) at CBGB's in New York City on December 30, 1977.
 
       In 1992, Co.Ro released a version that featured Taleesa that sold over 660,000 copies. It was a gold record in France and reached number one in Italy, Spain, and several other European countries.

      A well-known Unplugged version was recorded by 10,000 Maniacs in 1993 for MTV Unplugged, with a few lyrical alterations. The recording gained considerable radio airplay and reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, which was the first time the group broke the top forty.

      In 2008, Cascada recorded a version (Eurodance) which appears on their second album Perfect Day. The music video for the single premiered on YouTube on 28 May 2008. The single was released on July 18, 2008 in Germany, July 21, 2008 in France and August 4, 2008 in the UK.
