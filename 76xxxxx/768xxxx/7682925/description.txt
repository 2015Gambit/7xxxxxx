*Notes*
Anything that's good about the artwork is thanks to G. The Cock.  I tried to make artwork myself, but didn't know how to do it right, so G. The Cock fixed it up immensely.  

But I'm sure it would look far better if I'd asked him to start from scratch, instead of from what I sent him.

The mix isn't close to perfect, and levels (loudness) vary, but it was good enough that I mostly didn't think remastering could improve it, so here's what I did:

In two places I increased levels: for 47.23 seconds of t12 (0:37.1395 to 1:24.37385, to 90%) and for 14 minutes 37.63 seconds from t13@1:42.06370 to the end of the recording, to 85%).

Removed clicks (most of which were both barely audible and near the source's trackmarks) at 2:38:40, 6:33:38, 10:35:27, 13:45:31, 19:45:56, 24:16:65, 30:41:54, 34:57:53, 38:08:44, 39:37:12, 39:50:41, 45:34:14, 46:19:40, 50:42:74, 57:36:30, and 61:40:00

Removed 0.15 second dropout @48:54:74
