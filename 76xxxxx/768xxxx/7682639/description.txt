As a result of a catastrophic war between the United Earth Coalition and
 the Asian Pacific Alliance, Earth has been rendered an almost uninhabitable
 wasteland. The only hope lies in a distant planetary system, where the moon
 Taurus holds the key to restoring Earth's dwindling water supply. As a
 battle-hardened member of the surviving UEC forces, Lt Myrik is put in
 command of an armed vehicle carrier. By traversing the seas and establishing
 a network of island bases, his mission is to hunt down the enemy and conquer
 the Dead Zone on the planetoid Taurus
