Its the same for the most cracks out there, please learn that."
,Questoran,2012-10-04T14:25Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This torrent is shady as fuck. First of all, it started stomping out my AV software bumping RAM usage in each of them to at least 1GB. Second of all, it has it's compatibility settings fixed to Vista. And lastly, installation exits at the end with an error or just freezes. 

Instead of DLing this, download SKIDROW release and crack only from RELOADED. That way it will work 100%. And yes, I tried to install multiple times, with AV on/off and nothing changes. "
