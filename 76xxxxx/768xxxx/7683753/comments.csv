,loquorlicker,2012-09-29T07:29Z,"@Joecooler2u:

It's a bad archive. If you treat it as a RAR and extract the files from it you should have only one bad page, #16."
,Silvak,2012-09-29T07:29Z,Only page 16 wouldn't load for me.  Didn't seem to really miss anything in the story though so not a big deal.  Thanks still!
,Joecooler2u,2012-09-29T08:58Z,Thanks. Removed the bad page (cdisplayex made it seem like multiple pages) re-did the RAR file and it works perfect now.
,Joecooler2u,2012-09-29T09:00Z,Thanks took your suggestion and removed the broken page and re-did the RAR file works fine now.

,sven_svengali2,2012-09-29T11:04Z,"mdusanjay youÂ´re right about the original file on your hdd.
IÂ´ve learned by trial and error to dl my own ul to check the quality once minced through cyberspace.
Might be the client that fucks things up like the ""new"" utorrent leaves out filetypes and what not."
,keviner,2012-09-29T17:59Z,"I have dl several mdusanjay comic torrents with the Broken Archive complaint. I have had NO problems and they have scanned Virus Free. Most likely it is an end user problem (which they easily fixed) so ignore them.
Huge props to the uploader! Thanks for all the great scans!!!
(@ s-s, winrar says its broken? winrar? stone age prog, 7-zip rules!)"
