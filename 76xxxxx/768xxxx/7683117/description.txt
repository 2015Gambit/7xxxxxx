Tower defense game. It's great for Touhou fans, of course, but it's also pretty good in its own right. The towers are really interesting.

Gameplay Footage:(Level with a bunch of obstacles)(I told you Orreries' Sun is awesome)


Entirely in Japanese, but that doesn't really matter since it has no story. If you need help, you can consult this handy wiki page, which has subpages describing characters and their towers, as well as how to unlock the two super secret bonus characters.
