,xtraB,2012-09-29T15:31Z,"well here is activation toolkit and personalization as well, so for those who love to complaint, just keep rolling and no one is forcing you to download, so save your  saliva,,,, instead give KKS21199  credit for taking the time and effort by uploading this for us, complaints comments should be decent and no offensives. thanks"
,KKS21199,2012-09-29T16:18Z,"@everybodylies : sorry about that, sometime i can't upload things to application windows. so i will upload it to gamespc.

@xtraB : thanks, do u have youtube channel"

cheers,"
,Jan-Bertil,2012-09-29T23:12Z,"Of course it doesn't work. Grow up, laddies...."
,xtraB,2012-09-30T00:24Z,"if it doesnt work you must be doing something very wrong, or either you have a piece of junk for computer ,i dont know but works for me, always ppl complaint  anyway,, fuck it..  @KKS21199 yea i got a you tube channel george241963    "
,ROCKnTIME,2012-09-30T02:05Z,@xtraB.. The point of having comments is to share with others your own personal experience if the program works or not for each individual user.. If it doesn't work for some people then it doesn't mean its a complaint.. It means use at your own risk..   
,KKS21199,2012-09-30T04:50Z,"Guys, if it doesn't activate your windows try running it as administrator and then use the default installer. Also try disabling ur antivirus,

the personalization tool works fine when you run it as admin. If you change your theme or your start screen then you need to click log off button which will be showed up after you click apply metro. lock screen and profile picture  will work fine without restarting your system."
,KKS21199,2012-09-30T04:52Z,@xtraB : i couldn't find you on youtube.
,xtraB,2012-09-30T04:56Z,"@ROCKnTIME i wrote that do to past experiences with some ppl  who just like to post garbage comments, believe it or not, the pirate bay got few ppl that just go around writing garbage, lies and offensive comments all over ppl's torrents (even when those torrents are good) I know cause i check the torrents myself so i know when someone is here just spewing garbage"
,xtraB,2012-09-30T05:02Z,"@KKS21199, i tried to write the page link but TPB seems to not letting it haapen, just go to your inbox on you tube and type the ID name i gave you and the message should get through. or just write my ID name on google search bar and it will take you to one of many pages i have been through so you can find my channel page, if not let me have your ID and i will find you"
,xtraB,2012-09-30T05:06Z,"@KKS21199  you right,, sorry, intead of george is georgie241963,, i made a mistake now you should get through"
,cwong668,2012-09-30T23:37Z,"the personalization tool works fine now...

i was putting the tool & the pictures in the external drive and not the c: drive, this might be the reason why it was not working...

after reading KKS21199 message saying it works ... so i tried again ... finally now i put the tool & the pictures in the c: drive and it is working now...

the activator & the personalisation tools both works ok now...

cheers,"
