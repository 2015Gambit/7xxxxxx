,thefan23,2012-09-28T21:08Z,Good job. Could you do a few 720p rips? I have ATV1
,catskinsox,2012-09-28T22:19Z,"Sorry, only doing 1080p. "
,ScubaSteve5678,2012-09-28T22:43Z,"@thefan
Check out dabadguy69 he did this and other movies in 720p"
,FabioXS,2012-09-29T16:59Z,"Did you ever get small glitches in the audio?
I tried encoding ""I, Robot"" from a high quality MKV with techrod's 1080p preset and the file is great except some glitches and pops throughout the movie..."
,catskinsox,2012-09-29T20:52Z,"I don't know about any pops or anything. I don't think I've experienced that.  I assume you did check the source to make sure it wasn't doing the same thing?  Anyway, after reading your note, it reminded me I haven't seen I, Robot in a long time.  I may add it to my collection soon, and here as well."
,FabioXS,2012-10-01T14:35Z,Source is clean.. I'll try again and see if the pops apear in the same places
,catskinsox,2012-10-03T15:25Z,"Also, you can try with the latest nightly build, see if that helps:
https://build.handbrake.fr

Btw, I just encoded I, Robot, so I may add that in the ""not too distant future"".  I have a few others going up first, though."
,FabioXS,2012-10-04T00:57Z,"I'm already using the nightly build.
I'll try an other movie, maybe it was a one time deal"
