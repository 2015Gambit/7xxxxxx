Here is a collection of scholarly works compiled from a few sources. So you know, there are only pro-Christian titles in here, but they are all well-respected scholars in their fields of study.

They are difficult to locate online and I do not take credit for the majority of their availability. 

TPB member moman73 had a few in his torrents and generally is able to collect good resources from the opposite viewpoint. I do recommend going through his torrents for some solid gems.

Flaming this torrent does not change the fact that I did not write these books. I am only making them available since it seemed the bulk of religious torrents were very negative in their depiction to Christian ideas. 

So here's to speech equality!
