You are either an American or you belong in another country. The school should not  allow Cinco de mayo celebrations on school∩╗┐ time. If they want to celebrate outside of school then that is their choice. They must be American citizens to attend & means they can have a choice; either embrace our American flag and be loyal to it or get your butts back to Mexico where your loyalties are. What they did in suspending these students is just wrong and UN-American! sue that school!!!
