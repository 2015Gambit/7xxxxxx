,Piet23,2012-09-29T12:05Z,I still feel that its gonna be trash but this first episode was extremely good. One of the most exciting pilots I have ever seen.

,walkersdelight,2012-09-29T18:27Z,Good download quality but there is an irritating black colored watermark at the bottom right screen apparently to cover the TV production name.  If you can will yourself not to stare or be distracted by it than it's alright to see this download or else look for another one with no color marks.
,walkersdelight,2012-09-29T19:07Z,My Bad. Turned out there was no black watermark in the video when I played it in my Samsung Galaxy Tablet and is alright. Must have been the upgrade I made on the VLC player in my Window XP laptop which caused the glitch.  Great download.  Thanks.

,pipi8,2012-10-01T09:55Z,thank you :)
,tflagger997,2012-10-05T02:42Z,"No, Lost was a total lie.  They strung together meaningless storylines promising to tie it all together and did nothing of the sort.   In this there is a certain amount of unknowns, but ABC knows after we bailed on Fast Forward, that if they do not deliver answers in the same season they can kiss another $100M of production costs goodbye."
