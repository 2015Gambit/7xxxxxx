,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-30T12:07Z,just finished watching these & I gotta say...not bad.it comes across a little cheesey but still pretty good.I noticed in the credits that Zac from GAC is a producer so I don't think its ment to poke fun at people.he's to hardcore about the paranormal to be part of something that made a joke of it
