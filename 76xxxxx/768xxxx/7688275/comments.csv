[T],Gh0stNet,2012-09-30T16:35Z,"Scene group SKIDROW released Update 1 and 2 of Hitman: Sniper Challenge for PC. Read the changelogs here and enjoy!

    UPDATE 2:
    The primary change in this update fixes a problem found on some machines where they could not connect to the Sniper Challenge leaderboard servers.

    This update also addresses a problem accidentally introduced by the previous update, where the Polish and Russian text language options had been swapped. This is now resolved.

    UPDATE 1:
    - Some users would not hear any audio during the introduction movie. This is fixed.
    - Various performance improvements.
    - Fixes to mouse precision.
    - Fixes for issues with Texture Quality and Texture Filtering in the graphics options.
    - Miscellaneous other small fixes.

    We are still investigating an issue where some users are unable to connect to the Sniper Challenge leaderboards, and hope to have another patch out for this shortly. "
