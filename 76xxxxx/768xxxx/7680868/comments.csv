Low budget doesn't mean guaranteed poor movie. It certainly increases the possibility and this film shows it.

Awful acting.

Terrible ""script"".

Unimaginative characters, typical hillbilly stereotyping.

There may be hidden low budget gems out there, this isn't one of them, its complete rubbish. Cant think of one redeeming quality. 

I rarely switch a movie off, and in this case didn't, but came very close.

Avoid."
