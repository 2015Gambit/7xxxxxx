Suburban family the Pilches, live in a flooded, warm and uncertain world where all the banks have disappeared, along with much of Britain's coastline.

They encounter all the familiar dilemmas that have shaped family life through the ages, only this time those struggles are played out against the backdrop of a dog-eat-dog future.
