THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER, SEASON 16, EPISODE 3.
H.264, 60FPS, 720P, Transport Stream, MP4, AAC


NOTE
--------------------------------------------------
-Make sure you have a powerful PC capable of decoding h.264 at 60FPS in 720p. This does require a bit of power, and your typical old laptops and such are not the best.

-Always use Windows Media Player. Or you can also try Media Player Classic Home Cinema. Just make sure you have Shark007's codec pack installed and LAV is currently being used. Check the box for "Suggested Settings" after installing to activate LAV support.

-MAC users may want to try the Perian codec with Quicktime, or even BSPlayer. Linux users should use MPlayer. For both, MAC and Linux, VLC may be your best choice if the suggested players and codecs do not work.

-If you have issues playing this on your PS3 or Xbox 360, try renaming the file extension from .mp4 to .mpg or .mpeg. This is said to work, though not personally tested. Leave feedback if this method works.

-There will be no problems if you follow these tips and if there is a problem, your system simply cannot handle it. These files are ripped and made for high-spec systems and are originally .ts(Transport Stream) files with the extension changed to .mp4(MPEG-4).
