,ajk1980,2012-09-29T05:45Z,Thanks for the effort you put into your uploads. Do you put these up anywhere else?? Any private sites
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-29T06:08Z,"@ajk1980
I only upload here. All my files are here, and usually the first uploader, sharing before anyone else does."

[T],SecTPB,2012-09-29T07:08Z,"@Prabath1234
Yes. I'll be doing the prelims and main card for UFC on Saturday. I'm also doing XFC 20 which just finished airing. I'm also doing this season of Dexter, The Walking Dead, and possibly American Horror Story."
,KShelbrock2,2012-09-29T07:29Z,"So noticing the info you posted for this torrent, you realize that WMP is probably your worst option? and VLC or Daum PotPlayer can handle this no problem right?"
,KShelbrock2,2012-09-29T07:31Z,"Also, anyone who doesnt have a computer capable of handling the quality can just use Freemake to convert it to a lower quality .AVI"
,Prabath1234,2012-09-29T07:42Z,"Thanks sec,I almost forgot XFC"
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-29T08:04Z,"@KShelbrock2
WMP has only one beneficial use, playback of transport streams. It is the one player that will always work for my files since they are transport streams. 

VLC is an overall bad player and people experience many issues with it due to the internal codecs being poorly utilized, the resource it takes up, and poor subtitle support. 

Best player overall has been and always will be Media Player Classic Home Cinema. 

There are many free encoders that will encode the files for you. For a simple encoder, I personally like Format Factory."

I'm uploading XFC 20 as soon as I am done playing a night of Call of Duty. :) 
Gonna put it up in a few hours."
,minnesnowta,2012-09-29T15:00Z,"ive found that both this episode and last you uploaded are good quality and audio, but it the video like is very jumpy when the cam moves.."
,ajk1980,2012-09-29T15:46Z,"i've never had any problems with vlc, and much rather it over windows media player, haven't used it for a couple of years so i guess it could be ok now."
,Mary64,2012-09-29T16:19Z,"Thanks for a great upload! I especially appreciate that you hade started to use the correct .ts extension.

With regards to conversion of a ts, I just drop it into mkvmerge to create an mkv container around it. That will create the correct info about the stream and sore it in the mkv, so that players (hardware and/or software) can better interpret it.

Also, it does at least some checking that the stream does conform to standards.

It's someting that the uploader could consider doing before the upload.

Anyway - big thanks!"
