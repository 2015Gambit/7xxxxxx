
Plankton Culture Manual - section 11 Amphipods only!
Fifth Edition from 1999


If you like this guide buy the 6th edition of the book. 
I paid for this 5th edition just to learn about plankton farming 
live foods etc. I will be buying the 6th edition now that i know how awesome this book is. This is all you need for: mysid shrimp, daphnia, copepods, amphipods, phytoplankton etc etc. maybe i will add another section later. peace, comment please.
