With the release of Bad Piggies, I decided to upload a Rovio Collection, since some of their games aren't on the site, and some of them don't have the most current version.

This torrent includes all 6 Android games, and HD versions of some games. The HD versions are meant for tablets, although they will work on phones. Do note though, that an HD version on 99% of phones will look the same as the regular version, but the HD version will have a smaller UI. All games included are the paid versions, except Bad Piggies which only has a free version. To remedy this, I've included Lucky Patcher which you can use to get rid of the adds in Bad Piggies.
