What's New in ACDSee 15
 
Keep track of your ever-growing collection. Polish up even the messiest of photos. Add something magical to an already great shot that's sure to impress. You can do it all, faster and easier than ever before, in ACDSee 15.
 
Hierarchical keywords
 
Organize your collection with hierarchical keywords that help you sort your photos better than ever before. For instance, let's say you create a keyword tree that looks like this: Events | Local | Birthdays. You can then assign a photo from last week's birthday celebration to the Birthdays keyword with the check of a box, and it implicitly gets added to the higher level keywords too. You can create as many levels as you want, and display all of the photos you've tagged with that keyword in one click. It's sorting, supersized!
 
Easily brush on edits
 
Want to soften only a face and not the entire photo? The Edit Brush makes it super easy and fast to apply any editing effect to a specific part of your photo. Choose your brush size and the amount of feathering to help you achieve exactly the look you want.
 
Blur smartly
 
Use the Smart Blur filter to blur areas of little or no detail while still maintaining the sharpness and important details of your photo. Try it as a creative effect or to reduce the noise in your photo for a smoother, less grainy look
 
Improved noise reduction
 
Don't delete those grainy, high ISO photos. Rescue them with ACDSee's improved noise reduction controls for smoother and more natural results, while saving as much edge detail as possible.
