Found a DVD9, but u want a DVD5"
,MoviesR101,2012-09-30T04:49Z,@NLUPPER002 - I'll take a DVD9! Can you tell me a good software to shrink it with? My Dvd Shrink doesn't work anymore? Will DvdFab shrink Dvd9's?
[V],NLUPPER002,2012-09-30T06:18Z,"The DVD9 i have is an NTSC and no NL Subs.

There is a NL translating from it.

So i can make a DVD9 and 5 if u will.
Can't find the PAL DVDR at the moment."
,MoviesR101,2012-09-30T19:37Z,I'll take either Dvd9 or Dvd5 as long as it has English audio? If it doesn't then it won't do me any good!
