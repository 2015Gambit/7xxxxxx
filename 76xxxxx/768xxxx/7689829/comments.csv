,PseudoPositive,2012-10-01T04:04Z,"This is either in the wrong section, a PS2 version with emulator, or it's fake. More info uploader!"
,Anroid869,2012-10-01T06:45Z,"This is bull, the game is only released for Ps-Portable and Ps2."
,shephard1,2012-10-01T13:49Z,"This is PC version, ported by NightLection team http://nightlection.do.am/"

,hopedeny,2012-10-03T16:59Z,"@thecats2011
i have no idea what you just said. and what the hell is a ""cheap stake?"""
,hopedeny,2012-10-03T17:03Z,supposedly a pc port of the psp/ps2 game. im not sure if its legit and i really have no interest in downloading it to see.
,whateverthefuck,2012-10-03T22:19Z,"I haven't checked this torrent myself, but according to the Russian site linked above this is a PS2 emulation, not a proper PC port. *shrug* I dunno, if you're a big fan of the series download and find out whether it's legit or not."
,Cerebral222,2012-10-05T07:49Z,"No doubt, this a PS2 emulation, but if a PS2 game is runs well on your PC, then you get to play the game with better graphics than PS2. I have VirtuaGirl HD on my rig, one advantage I found with PS2 emulation is that I can play the game in fullscreen while the the VGHD dancers are on top layer, best of both worlds. Ill check this out anyway, & let you guys know how it runs. "
