Judas's Note:

Due to the nature of 1994 film and how it was digitally transferred to blu-ray, Some of the video will look grainy and or show color banding/pixel shifting. Using filters to clean this up proved to be relatively counter productive by introducing "other" issues. I made the best attempt I could to try and provide the best image quality while maintaining a decent file size. Take a look through the screenshots, there are a few fuzzy ones simply because that's the way the blu-ray actually looks.
