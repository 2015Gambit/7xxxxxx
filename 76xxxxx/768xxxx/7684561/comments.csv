,dhjudasx,2012-09-29T19:12Z,"My upload speed sure isn't though..... Sorry downloaders.... fastest internet i can get peaks at 58KB/s upload speed... (512kbps) Might take 12 hours or more to download it.. but if everyone seeds for at least a little while after, it'd be greatly appreciated."
[V],YIFY,2012-09-29T19:25Z,"chucked on some seeding help for ya mate :)
btw, meant my initial comment in the utter most respect :)"
,dhjudasx,2012-09-30T06:44Z,"Oh i was just joking in chat about not being sure.... :p

Thanks for the assistance.... as soon as  what appears to be the majority of everyone finally getting it... most likely at the same time too..."
,dhjudasx,2012-09-30T09:16Z,"Come on guys, I'm litterally watching as some leechers hit the 99.9% and then 100%..... watch the seeders in swarm take a bump... and then not more than a few minutes later drops down again and litterally dozens of others waiting in line while my poor 58KB/s upload gets slammed still, share ratio is rediculious already lol. Please help out, can't expect yify and others like em to help seed all the time."
