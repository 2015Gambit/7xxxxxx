V.A. - Fading Yellow Vol. 13 (60's) [FLAC]

Genre: US, popsike and other delights

The last piece from the Fading Yellow  puzzle, leads us again to North America, forgotten treasures come to light in this 13th volume, an  ideal setting for the most demanding listeners, acoustic, guitar, baroque pop along with the always consistent and remarkable job on the covers and detailed notes about each musician. 

I would like to thank my friend Cor for all his  hard work and specially in these Fading Yellow series, most of them are limited and hard to find, and the value is sometimes large enough to obtain them. 
Thank you all.
