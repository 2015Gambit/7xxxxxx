The Science of Sex Appeal 
Take an up close look at how genetics, hormones and neurological factors are believed to influence our sexual attraction levels to one another. This program makes you rethink the concept of true romance, and see it in an entirely different way.
The Science of Sex Appeal isolates every detail of human sex appeal and explores it in terms of its evolution and function. It shows us what is genetic, what is hormonal, and what neurological. What is based on sight, what on smell and what on small, subtle cues like voice and movement? Ultimately, it takes one of our deepest subconscious processes and lays it out to us in shocking and specific detail. You'll never look at a stranger, or your loved one, or yourself, in quite the same way again.
