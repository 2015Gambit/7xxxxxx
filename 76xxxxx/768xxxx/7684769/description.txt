========================================================

Ilse Witch:


When a half-drowned elf is found floating in the seas of 

the Blue Divide, an old mystery resurfaces. Thirty years ago, 

an elven prince led an expedition in search of a legendary 

magic said to be more powerful than any in the world. Of all 

those who set out on that ill-fated voyage, not one has ever 

returned. Until now. The rescued elf carries a map covered 

with mysterious symbols–and Walker Boh, the last of the Druids, 

has the skill to decipher them. But someone else understands 

the map’s significance: the Ilse Witch, a ruthless young woman 

who wields a magic as potent as his own. She will stop at 

nothing to possess the map–and the magic it leads to.

========================================================

Antrax:


Now in Antrax, as the crew aboard the airship Jerle Shannara 

is attacked by evil forces, the Druid’s protégé Bek Rowe and 

his companions are pursued by the mysterious Ilse Witch. 

Meanwhile, Boh is alone, caught in a dark maze beneath the 

ruined city of Castledown, stalked by a hungry, unseen enemy.

========================================================

Morgawr:


The Morgawr is a centuries-old sorcerer of unimaginable 

might, who feeds upon the souls of his enemies. With a fleet 

of airships and a crew of walking dead men at his command, 

he is in relentless pursuit of the Jerle Shannara. His goal 

is twofold: to find and control the fabled 'magic' of 

Parkasia, and to destroy the Ilse Witch (his disciple) to 

keep her from using the magic to destroy him.

But she has already paid a heavy price for her actions. 

When Walker Boh persuades the witch to use the Sword of 

Shannara, she is exposed to its awesome power and forced

to confront the truth of her horrifying deeds as the Ilse 

Witch, causing her to flee deep into her own mind. She has 

only one protector: her brother Bek, who is determined to

redeem her.

He does this, and they use their combined magic to destroy 

the Morgawr. They go home to the Four Lands. But rather 

than going home with Bek, Grianne Ohmsford will be going 

now to Paranor, for Walker charged her with a very important 

task before he died: she is to foster a new Druid order.
