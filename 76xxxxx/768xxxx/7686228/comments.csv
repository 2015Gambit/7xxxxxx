               dedicated to brnging to justice those
               perpetrated these atrocities against
                the jewish people and many other races.       "
,mankydp,2012-09-30T23:42Z,"What about the 30 million killed the Ukraine in he 30's?  Or he Christians dead in China from 1947 to 1955?  The admit that they could have killed more and did a bad job.  Maybe the Japanese doing the job in Manchuria.  All of this falls on propaganda and a supposed regime change.  The new guys are better and thus many can die.  They then write the history.  Talk to the eastern Turkey Armenians, then the Cambodians, then the Russians that may still be around from Stalin.  You talk to these people and tell me how many of them are pounding into my life holocaust memorials and a movie every month to tell me about a chosen people.  I was chosen as a priceless magical creation at birth.  It does not matter who my mother was or dad.  It does not matter what their religion was.  It matters what I do with my short time on this earth and how I can contribute rather than use."
