This 2CD set is the complete piano works of Maurice Ravel played by Pascal Roge. 

Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) was a pianist from the turn of the 20th century. Though he is more known for his orchestral work, his mastery of the piano rivaled that of Chopin and Debussy. He was 12 years younger than Debussy, and the two spent some time together playing each others pieces. Often, people tend to group the two together despite Ravel's open acknowledgment that they differed substantially in approach. Regardless, Ravel's piano works are, in my opinion, some of the most relaxing, soothing piano pieces ever written. Enjoy!
