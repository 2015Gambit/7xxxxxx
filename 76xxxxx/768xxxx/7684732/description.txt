=====================================

Running with the Demon:


In a sleepy steel-mill town, the ultimate 

battle between Good and Evil is about to 

begin . . .
Sinnissippi Park, in Hopewell, Illinois, 

has long hidden a mysterious evil, locked 

away from humankind by powers greater than 

most could even imagine. But now the 

malevolent creatures that normally skulk in 

the shadows of the park grow bolder, and 

old secrets hint at a violent explosion.

The brewing conflict draws John Ross to 

Hopewell. A Knight of the Word, Ross is 

plagued by nightmares that tell him someone 

evil is coming to unleash an ancient horror 

upon the world. Caught between them is 

fourteen-year-old Nest Freemark, who senses 

that something is terribly wrong but has not 

yet learned to wield the budding power that 

sets her apart from her friends.

Now the future of humanity depends upon a man 

haunted by his dreams and a gifted young 

girl--two souls who will discover what survives 

when hope and innocence are shattered forever . . .

=====================================

A Knight of the Word:


Nineteen-year-old Nest Freemark, another enforcer 

of the word, has gone on to become one of the best 

long-distance runners in the nation's history, and 

she's bound to win a gold medal in the Olympics. 

More important, however, she is John Ross's last 

hope to again take up the mantle of his knighthood. 

If he continues to turn his back on his power, he 

will be subverted by the forces of the Void, and 

if she cannot persuade him to accept his fate, then 

the Lady will have no choice but to send another 

agent and have him killed. And time is running out: 

According to John's dreams, on Halloween night ┬ù in 

two days ┬ù something evil will happen to Simon 

Lawrence, the man in charge of the shelter, and 

Nest knows that a demon is loose among the homeless.

=====================================

Angel Fire East:


The story begins when John Ross shows up at Nest 

Freemark's door with a young boy. He reveals that 

the boy, who he calls Little John, is actually a 

gypsy morph, a creature born of wild magic and 

capable of enormous deeds, for good or evil. Both 

sides have approximately one month to unravel 

Little John's secrets and recruit him for their 

cause. Because after one month, the magic that 

holds him together will tear him apart, and his 

powers will be lost forever.
