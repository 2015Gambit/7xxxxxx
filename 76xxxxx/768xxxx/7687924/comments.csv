,gil_bates,2012-09-30T17:14Z,"Trollbagger:  You must have been drinking some of that hopey-changey koolaid.  Most Tea Party people are the type of patriots who do serve their country, not those Occupier hippies who would be the type to have run away to Canada when there was a draft.  My bet is you are so ""busy"" fighting Trolls that you never served in the military yourself.

A better question is this:  If the doubtful happens, and Romney wins, will the majority of people who are in some way dependent on big government riot in the streets?"

-- Obama has caused America to fall to it's lowest point ever. 

False, Obama inherited the shit sandwich left behind by the past administration, and has to deal with an opposition that would rather allow the countrys credit rating to sink than do the same job they had no trouble
agreeing to do under the previous president. 

--Taxes and medical costs have skyrocketed. 

 What Taxes and medical costs have gone up due to Obama?  No Grover Norquist sycophant will allow taxes to increase, and the polices put in place by the current president serve to get money back to people but cutting back on medical insurance waste while making such coverage more affordable for millions of citizens.  

--Jobs are moving overseas. 

 Jobs started moving overseas under the previous presidents policies and regulation measures; and were facilitated by the profit over quality goals of companies like Bain Capital. 

--The fewer and fewer working people left are stuck paying huge tax bills for groups of people who don't want to work, accustomed to govt handouts. 

 Again, which of your taxes have gone up as a result of this President?  
 Do you know what a strawman is?  Because thats exactly what you seem to be 
 attacking here.  Or would you prefer an empty chair?  

--The national debt is at an all time high thanks to Obama. 

 And none of those debts were incurred before he even came into office? 
The Bush administration started with a surplus and ended even deeper in debt than before the last attempt to balance the budget.  

Look at 

--the failures in Libya, 

 What would you have done differently?  

--Gitmo prisoners freed attacking USA again

 Such as?  And were they released by Obama personally? Or by the system of 
intelligence agencies and military tribunals who found no reason to charge
hundreds of people held in indefinite detention for years based sometimes
on no more than a rumor from a bad neighbor? 

-- Iran, Israel, and 

  You have not been paying attention, have you?  Or do you think that bombs and troops are the only tools at a Presidents disposal? 

--Obama meeting with rappers and not the PM's of other countries.

 Diplomacy works both ways, or do you think those ""PM's of other countries"" get to call the shots of how the US sets policy (while some members of congress do seem to think that way)? 


-- * 2012 = ABO = ANYBODY but Obama. * -- 

 And this is truely the attitude that is leading this country the wrong way.
