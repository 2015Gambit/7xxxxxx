,ROM4N,2012-09-28T23:28Z,"@gumph1688:
this is only for those who use truncate mode


this game has no problems unauthorized disk error or disk unreadable"

not recorded well, truncate mode works but is not possible to install the HDD"
,gumph1688,2012-09-29T01:02Z,"@ROM4N
 - i will be trucating, do i install first, then play mp3 then game, or just play mp3 then game?"
,ROM4N,2012-09-29T01:17Z,"@gumph1688

just play mp3 then game

truncate mode with this particular game is unlikely the installation, simply truncate record mode and play without installing the game

recalls the necessity of the latest dashboard to play"
,ninjacro,2012-09-29T02:08Z,is it working or not?1 i dont have usb for xbox so can i just burn it and will it work?!
