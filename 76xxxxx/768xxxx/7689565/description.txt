QG 73 - Gravitational shifting

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The gravitational shifting of photon energies are revealed to be the relativistic correction of EM energies as they move through electromagnetic components of GEM fields

Coronal heating, the refraction of light, solar activity cycles and the pioneer anomaly are all investigated.

The seventy-third chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
