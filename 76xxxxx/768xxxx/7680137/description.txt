"This is the COMPLETE soundtrack to FTL. Each interactive track from the game has been split into its two parts, both of which are complete tracks in their own right. 

Think of it like a 2-disc set: tracks 1-14 are the low-key, relaxing Explore pieces, while tracks 15-29 make up the exciting, fast-paced Battle music. Listen to whichever half fits your mood, or make your own arrangement! 

None of the music from the game has been omitted. 

Sweet album art by FTL designer/artist Justin Ma."



The other source isn't being seeded, and this soundtrack is awesome, so I'll be seeding this for the next couple days. Help me out please.
