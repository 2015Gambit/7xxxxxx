I thought it got cancelled and the last episode was like 2 years ago!!

Is this truly a new season??"
,boi_deli,2012-09-29T08:14Z,"This is the first episode of the fifth and final season of Fringe which consists of thirteen episodes.

Thanks, eztv."

,Halizar,2012-09-29T09:23Z,"eztv is the best. A/V is always 10 and I like the uploaders that give just the file you want and not the other crap like torrent dled from and other useless junk.

Keep up the good work eztv people ;)."
,lovecat66,2012-09-29T10:02Z,THX eztv ! You are always the best ! 
,Fleck99,2012-09-29T14:20Z,"@Zan, yeah it's still going, new season started last night.  Season 5 is the final though :("
,machspee,2012-09-29T15:56Z,"@MP4SUX: May I ask you to kindly please FUCK OFF? Pointing out the error or glitches is one thing but COMPLAINING is really pathetic and annoying for file sharing community.

If you really insist on 'perfect' quality downloads, wait for itunes or  Amazon downloads and go fucking buy them, you moron 

You get these for free and yet you whine how terrible the uploads are.  Stupid fuck."
,pjatgv,2012-09-30T02:54Z,@MP4SUX dude even ur name is retarded mp4 sux why? it fucks over .avi with better quality and lower disk space dumb fuck go fuck urself
,mstader,2012-09-30T23:49Z,"Ok, I think we all gave this show more than one chance...walter was brilliant, leonard nemoy was under-utilized, peter and olivia had potential but suddenly we're in the future with their daughter and now the whole thing has reached a ridiculous plot and an eventual under developed conclusion.  Sorry to lay out an opinion on this forum but really disappointing series.  Fantastic letdown."
,SaveCash,2012-10-05T03:45Z,"Thanks ez.

I wouldn't be surprised if the user mp4sux is butt_sex the troll."
