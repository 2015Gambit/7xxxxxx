
The classic first person shooter Doom for Android!

I decided to upload this because it was the only doom port I could get to work decently on my phone, and I believe it got taken down from the Google Play Store.

Instructions: Unrar, Install the apk, and copy the Doom folder to the root of your SDcard. I also included Lucky Patcher because it will spam your notifications with ads so I highly recommend that you take away the app's permission to internet access to stop that. Also, the game is much better when using a physical controller (such as a PS3 controller).
