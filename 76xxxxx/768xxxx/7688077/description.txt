...................................NFO:.................................................And the legend continues...

For nearly ten years, the swamps of Texarkana, Arkansas have been quiet. 
But now locals are once again reporting sightings of the legendary Boggy 
Creek Creature, only this time it has returned with a vengeance.

After numerous town folk are brutally attacked, anthropologist Brian C. 
Lockhart and his team of student researchers venture into the swamps to 
investigate the reports. As Lockhart and three students head down to the 
muddy banks of the Sulfur River, they soon find that invading the territory 
of others exacts a price. Coming face to face with not one, but two primal 
terrors, Lockhart's team encounters the most harrowing and unforgettable 
secrets of Boggy Creek.



there are some animal killings in this movie, but they are blatantly fake a
nd hilarious very cheesy/campy stuff

ENJOY!
