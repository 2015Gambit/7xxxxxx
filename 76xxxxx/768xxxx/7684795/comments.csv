,Chaos324,2012-10-04T16:12Z,"First and foremost thank you SO much for your upload of this guide, I think we all appreciate it very much.

If possible, could you please try to get update 4.0.5155 It includes: 
DAILIES/REPUTATION
Solved waypoint issue in the Golden Lotus dailies/reputations.

These are some of the most annoying dailes to do right now with the way Zygor is acting with them.

Thank you again!"
