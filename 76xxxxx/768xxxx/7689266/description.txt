For those of you who love The xx at their most sad-eyed and romantically dysfunctional, we recommend ignoring the first track on their second album, ΓÇÿCoexistΓÇÖ. Wafting in the same rarefied airspace as ΓÇÿStarsΓÇÖ did on their 2009 debut ΓÇÿxxΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿAngelsΓÇÖ is the boldest Valentine the band have ever recorded. Romy Madley Croft swoons against ethereal guitars, repeating the word ΓÇ£loveΓÇ¥ like sheΓÇÖs been sucker-punched by the sheer intensity of her heart-shaped feeling. SheΓÇÖs revelling in the joy of it, but also realising the utter failure of the simple four-letter word to express the depth of what sheΓÇÖs experiencing.
