"Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11"

The fifth and final season picks up 
from the ominous events of last 
season's "Letters of Transit" episode, 
in which the year is 2036 and the 
overpowering Observers rule. The Fringe 
team - preserved in amber for 20 years 
- is now a rebel resistance team 
fighting for freedom. Peter, reunited 
with his now adult daughter, Etta, sets 
out to find out what happened to his 
wife and Etta's mom - Olivia - as they 
start their mission to save the world 
from the Observers
