,MP4SUX,2012-09-29T04:55Z,"Ahem ...

""Those RAR loving morons"", if you please.

""The Scene"" are intransigent on so many fronts."
,.Leto.,2012-09-29T05:00Z,"lol, I agree that it's useless but there's no reason to be that mad about it, it only takes a few seconds to unrar those files."
,mdh99,2012-09-29T05:26Z,"Get XBMC; it doesn't care if they're multi-part zip/rar, it just plays them."
,TheNemo,2012-09-29T15:45Z,"I can't believe these stupid comments. Although I prefer not to download .rar files, there is a very excellent reason for them which I respect: You can seed this forever and NOT get in trouble, if you delete a single of the .rar files after you've watched it. It's very clever."
