Slackware is an advanced GNU/Linux operating system, designed with the twin goals of ease of use and stability as top priorities. Including the latest popular software while retaining a sense of tradition, providing simplicity and ease of use alongside flexibility and power, Slackware brings the best of all worlds to the table.

Since its first beta release in April of 1993, the Slackware Linux Project has aimed at producing the most "UNIX-like" Linux distribution out there. Slackware complies with the published Linux standards, such as the Linux File System Standard. We have always considered simplicity and stability paramount, and as a result Slackware has become one of the most popular, stable, and friendly distributions available.

Slackware 14 brings long term supported Linux kernel 3.2.29, X.org X11R7.7, KDE Software Compilation 4.8.5, Firefox 15.0.1, Calligra Office 2.4.3, GNU C Library 2.15, GNU Compiler Collection 4.7.1, Apache (httpd) 2.4.3, Perl 5.16.1, Python 2.7.3, Ruby 1.9.3-p194, Subversion 1.7.6, git 1.7.12.1, mercurial 2.2.2, and much more free and open source software.
