,Dirtfrog399,2012-09-30T18:18Z,Sorry for the uncut upload. 
,redrida,2012-09-30T19:40Z,Thanks for the warning and upload!! would you happen to have the first 2? 
,john.stagliano,2012-09-30T19:42Z,U rule!!! Will you be able to upload the others as well? Seems one can't watch this one until the others have been viewed? And I don't want to spoil the experinec by seeing the results in advance either. I picture Malin will speak about the previous heats more than once...
,Dirtfrog399,2012-09-30T20:08Z,The other 2 are on the way.  The first races failed in the capture so I had to start over.  Should be up in an hour or two. 
,john.stagliano,2012-09-30T20:44Z,"U the man, I saw the other torrent is up. I'm pissing my pants in excitement! :)"
,john.stagliano,2012-10-01T00:12Z,"Crap, 15 minutes of the race is missing!!! :("

,Dirtfrog399,2012-10-03T17:46Z,"Missing the last part of second race?  File looks fine whene I play it.  Not sure what happened there...  You can try : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7692106/2012_Motocross_of_Nations_HD_720p_slicknick610
