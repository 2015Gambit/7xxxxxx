Meanwhile, Shyama meets and falls in love with Shyam (Rehman), the son of the family she works for and who is a doctor who wants to treat the poor. With both of being ill-treated by the woman of the house, who is Shyam's step mother, they decide to elope. However, Kiran comes to her, abandoned and impregnated. Shyama goes along with her without informing Shyam in order to find Ajit. They find Ajit but he escapes from them. The two sisters then relocate to another town. Kiran has the child, Shyama works in another house, where in order to get Kiran settled with the young man of the house and to prove her to be without blemish, she takes it upon herself to claim to be the mother of the child. This causes further complications with Shyam, who has managed to trace her out and now believes that she has been unfaithful to him. Wallowing in grief, he falls ill.
