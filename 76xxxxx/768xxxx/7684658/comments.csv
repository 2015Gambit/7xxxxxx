Are you planning on doing anything with Cerebus? (I saw your Glamourpuss torrent) I'm looking for #26, the first chapter of ""High Society"". (The one in the big torrent is wrong; it's the TCBG Silverspoon stories from the Cerebus Weekly reprints from the 90's.)

Thanks again!"

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-30T03:59Z,"Thanks aboynamedcrow. Yeah, working on the Cerebus stuff, but I have no timeline at the moment. It's a lot of issues and I don't want to get burned out on the process because I stick with one book for too long. Strangely, my digital copy of 26 is that same issue. I guess I never noticed because I have the individual issues and the phone book. I'll scan my issue 26 if I can't find it elsewhere. So eventually, when I have all 300 issues and all the extras 'Restored', I will upload it."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-30T04:00Z,"Mr. Meathook, I have issues 1-3 of Lucha Libre, but that's all. I'll upload those if you're looking for those issues. Let me know."
,ButchMeathook,2012-09-30T10:13Z,"Yes sir, kindly upload them."
