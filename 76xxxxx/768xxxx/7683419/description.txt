Documentary

Millions of sales on both sides of the Atlantic, near bankruptcy, pills, thrills, spats, 
prats, successes, excesses, pick-me-ups and breakdowns - all spiralled together to create 
some of the most defining music of the 20th century.

This is the definitive and fully-authorised documentary of the highs and lows of the UK's 
most inspired and dissolute independent record label - Creation Records. Over 25 years 
after Creation's first records, it follows the story from the days of the Jesus and 
Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Primal Scream and Teenage Fanclub to the Boo Radleys
the Super Furry Animals and of course Oasis, among many, many more.

The label's enigmatic founder Alan McGee talks candidly of the trail which led from humble 
beginnings in Glasgow, via drink and drug dependency to being wined and dined at No 
10 Downing Street by Tony Blair...
