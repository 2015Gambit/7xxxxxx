,dr34m3rs,2012-09-30T09:15Z,"A note about RAR format: Even though RAR files have a bad connotation surrounding them due to the fact they are often used to hide virus and fake password protected torrents, they help against file corruption and generally reduce file size. On my system it only took 5 seconds to decompress it."
