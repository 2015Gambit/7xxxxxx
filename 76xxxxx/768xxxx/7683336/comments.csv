,borat24,2012-09-29T15:20Z,"Adam Sandler SUCKS DICK

The fact that he is still so popular only proves how many idiots we have in this world, especially in USA"
,jimimetis,2012-09-29T16:15Z,"obviously when you ain't got no talent and/or imagination, best thing to do is either quit or make so many stupid movies that people will just watch it cooking/surfing on the web/or trying to get a woman at the theater. that would be the only reason i could play this shit "

,Jimmyto,2012-09-30T00:46Z,Remembering when Adam Sandler made good movies is like remembering when Lindsay Lohan used to be hot
,ciropabon,2012-09-30T01:47Z,"I have no doubt that the A/V must be very good, after downloading many movies from Scene 4 All. Thanks, guy.

For those asking how good is the movie, it has 5 stars out of 10 in IMDB. Excerpt from an user comment there: ""If a grandma getting funky in bed or a big fat pole dancer popping out tennis balls floats your boat, go see this absolute undesirable bad aroma of a movie that makes The Wedding Singer look like The Godfather. Who is this intended for, too crude for 13 year olds, too stupid for 30 year olds. The first 10 minutes of the Kentucky Fried Movie is funnier than this embarrassment."""
,moldoveanude,2012-09-30T01:49Z,"The film received negative reviews from critics, some citing it was Sandler's worst and most offensive film to date[citation needed] (after Just Go with It and Jack and Jill), while others said it was a decent R-rated Adam Sandler film. That's My Boy was a box office failure, failing to bring back its $70 million budget. It is the sixth Sandler film to be rated R."
,jameskrueger2nd,2012-09-30T01:57Z,"Thanks for the up but these two actor boys are so incredibly lame

,Phatfish,2012-09-30T04:52Z,"All though the movie is full of bad ideas the worst one must be to make it almost 2 hours long. 

I was vagaly amused though trough some parts. "
,borat24,2012-09-30T08:21Z,"@Niccodemuz: what's my nick got to do with what I said? You do realize its not my real name and I'm not really Borat?

,Savre,2012-10-01T06:34Z,"A/V = 9 M = 4 Thnx uploader/Scene

As someone who enjoyed Adam Sandler movies from when I was a young kid I have to say that this film is terrible. 

It really is Happy Gilmore + Every other Sandler movie mashed into one. If you've seen his previous films you've seen this one. In no way has Sandler tried to change the way he does things. Not that that is bad but it isn't good either. 

It was painful to watch tbh. Its best suited for a lazy Sunday. "
,Gimpman83,2012-10-03T14:31Z,"Good quality but wasn't a fan of the movie. 
TY scene"
