Town Hall Party was California's largest country music barndance, and it ran from early 1952 until early 1961. The show was broadcast every Saturday night from a theater made up to look like an old barn, in the Compton suburb of Los Angeles. The guest list was a ''who's who'' of country, rockabilly, and rock 'n roll. Here's incredibly rare footage of Eddie Cochran filmed Feb. 7th, 1959. This DVD includes a rare interview with Cochran, and he performs C'mon Everybody, Have I Told You Lately That I Love You, Don't Blame It On Me, Summertime Blues, School Days, Be Honest With Me, Money Honey and others.
