Introducing FS Force 2
Fully compatible with FSX and Prepar3D
FS Force is an add-on module that works in conjunction with your force feedback joystick to provide realistic control loading, as well as numerous other force feedback effects, designed to enhance your total flight experience.
In the air, you'll feel realistic trim forces, centering forces that vary with airspeed, stall buffeting, and more. On the ground, you'll feel bumps, dips, pavement grooves, braking forces, hard landings and more. You can also add friction and damping to the flight controls to further enhance realism.
Each airplane can have it's own force feedback profile, and all forces are optional and fully customizable.  Your force feedback experience can be as subtle or intensive as you like.
Programmed using the latest in DirectX technology, FS Force will take your flight simulator experience to an exciting new level.
Requires a force feedback joystick.
