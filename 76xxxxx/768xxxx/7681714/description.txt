Book #1 - The Maze Runner:


When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. 

His memory is blank. But heΓÇÖs not alone. When the liftΓÇÖs doors open, Thomas finds 

himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the GladeΓÇöa large, open expanse surrounded 

by stone walls.

Just like Thomas, the Gladers donΓÇÖt know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know 

is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every 

night theyΓÇÖve closed tight. 

And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.

Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent upΓÇöthe first girl to ever arrive in 

the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers. 

Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark 

secrets buried within his mind.

Book #2 - The Scorch Trials:


Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end. No more puzzles. No more variables. And no 

more running. Thomas was sure that escape meant he and the Gladers would get their lives 

back. But no one really knew what sort of life they were going back to.

In the Maze, life was easy. They had food, and shelter, and safety . . . until Teresa 

triggered the end. In the world outside the Maze, however, the end was triggered long ago.

Burned by sun flares and baked by a new, brutal climate, the earth is a wasteland. 

Government has disintegratedΓÇöand with it, orderΓÇöand now Cranks, people covered in festering

wounds and driven to murderous insanity by the infectious disease known as the Flare, 

roam the crumbling cities hunting for their next victim . . . and meal.

The Gladers are far from finished with running. Instead of freedom, they find themselves 

faced with another trial. They must cross the Scorch, the most burned-out section of the 

world, and arrive at a safe haven in two weeks. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the 

variables and stack the odds against them.

Thomas can only wonderΓÇödoes he hold the secret of freedom somewhere in his mind? Or will he

forever be at the mercy of WICKED?

Book #3 - The Death Cure:


Thomas knows that Wicked can't be trusted, but they say the time for lies is over, that 

they've collected all they can from the Trials and now must rely on the Gladers, with full 

memories restored, to help them with their ultimate mission. It's up to the Gladers to 

complete the blueprint for the cure to the Flare with a final voluntary test.

What Wicked doesn't know is that something's happened that no Trial or Variable could have 

foreseen. Thomas has remembered far more than they think. And he knows that he can't 

believe a word of what Wicked says.

The time for lies is over. But the truth is more dangerous than Thomas could ever imagine.

Will anyone survive the Death Cure?
