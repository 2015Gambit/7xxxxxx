Tutorial how to cheat Dark Souls:

Dark souls is prolly the most stupid game ever done.

Nice hub maps but idiot character levelup, skills, spells and interface mechanics.

A game made by sadists for masochists. 10% rpg and 90% hack and slash.

If you really want rpg go for some professional titles like Dragon age and Witcher.


Tired about this game developers laugh about you be cheated and have no fun at all?


TSearch is your friend!


Download and run Tsearch.
Run the game and load you char.
Check your hp number.

Switch back to Tsearch.
Load Data.exe process.
Search for the hp number.

Switch back to game,take some damage,back to tsearch and check the hp again.

Switch back to Tsearch and refine your previous with the new number.

Back to game, heal yourself. Back to tsearch, refine the search again. 3 memory points results.

Freeze the 3 points => Infinite life.

Do the same mechanic with souls. Set it to 1mil souls and freeze, advance to level 200.
