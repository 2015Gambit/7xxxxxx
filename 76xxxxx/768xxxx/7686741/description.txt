This is a collection of music videos from the 1960's that I've found over the years.  Half are B&W clips from British TV, and the rest are color from various sources.

Animals - House of the Rising Sun
Leonard Nimoy - The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins (You gotta see this to believe it!)
Bob Dylan -With God on Our Side
Grateful Dead - Golden Road of Unlimited Devotion (MTV style video 13 years before MTV was born) and Live at Woodstock (I think the aspect ratio is fucked up on this one.  Garcia's head looks like a rugby ball.)
Moody Blues - Ride My Seesaw
Pink Floyd  - 	3 color clips from French TV  (No Syd)
		Jugband Blues (Syd's swan song)
Ritchie Havens - High Flying Bird
The Shadows - FBI
Sonny and Cher - I Got You Babe
Status Quo - Pictures of Matchstick Men
Tim Buckley - Coming Home
Jimi Hendrix - 3 B&W clips - Hey Joe, Purple Haze, Stone Free  (This stuff is loud, raw, and heavy - awesome!)
Led Zeppelin - Dazed and Confused

Please seed this as long as possible to keep this historical record alive for future generations.

Check back in a week or two for a collection of 70's videos.
