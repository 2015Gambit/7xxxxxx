That's right, be the 1st to solve my DVDFab issue & I'll post $20 USD to your account via PayPal.

Here's the problem: In the Licensee column it says ""Trial User"" all the way down & in the Update Expire Time column it says ""2012-Oct-08"".

Here are the details: I have been SUCCESSFULLY installing & upgrading hacked DVDFab for years & NEVER a problem until recently!!!

1) YES I installed the DVDFab as an Administrator.
2) YES, I was sure to not run the program after installation.
3) YES I copied & pasted the msvcr90.dll in the correct folder.
4) YES I rebooted the machine, ensured the Internet connection was disabled, turned off ""Check for updates.""
5) YES my sytem time & date are correct.
6) YES, after I discovered the problem I used Revo Uninstaller Pro to completely remove all traces of DVDfab & I ALSO used regedit.exe to find even more traces (which I also removed)!
7) YES, my ""Sytem Locale Language"" is set to English

ANYONE wanna be a HERO & make a quick $20?!?"
