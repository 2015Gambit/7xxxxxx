Um, don't they already..?"
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-29T06:10Z,"Btw, why no SAMPLE with this?? Could someone comment on whether the video has any flicker and how bad it is? I don't care about dark, people's heads, focus, etc. Thanks.  "

,humboldt46,2012-09-29T15:18Z,"Are you guys using camcorders from the 80's ??
why are all the cam movies such a terrible picture? Buy a new camcorder,it might help."
,caffinate,2012-09-29T16:02Z,"@humboldt46

Because most cameras that are small enough to smuggle in to a theater are not going to be very effective in low light situations.  You could do a better copy, but you would need a much larger aperture to capture more light.

Also, cameras which are good in low light situations are often very expensive.  If you have a few thousand dollars to throw at the problem, feel free."
,Fritz.,2012-09-29T22:01Z,"I dont usually complain about my download speeds, but honestly, less than 10kb/s is LOL.

Maybe i should just try after a few days.."
,CarlZeiss,2012-09-29T22:09Z,"@michaelrwatson 

LOL My thoughts, exactly."
,kingda74,2012-09-30T01:51Z,"This copy is ok, I guess

But man oh man, this film is bloodier than a whale  on her period. "
,GavinFace,2012-09-30T04:27Z,Seriously I have no idea why people watch these fucking bullshit cam versions.  It's absolute trash. If you have the patience to sit through and watch something of this apalling quality you must be a fucking medical retard.  Wait for the dvd version you stupid ass pumps.
,Galtar0420,2012-09-30T05:14Z,"Video=5 to dark and very blurry 
Audio=5 cant understand what there saying half the time. 
I got about 20 min in and had to stop. Its unwatchable in my opinion. Thanks for the upload.
TURN OFF AUTO FOCUS!!"

Video is Ok for a cam but it's a little to dark and grainy to see everything clearly.
"
,TedDekker,2012-09-30T09:06Z,My dick can record a better video than that. All I would have to do is pull it out in the movie theater and smack it all over the screen. I mean wtf? I just don't want all the girls jumping me because my dick is so huge so therefore I'll leave the beast in its chambers.
,daniel_dudau,2012-09-30T09:15Z,to TrogartheBoss666 why are the torrents?why not go f...your self?

,xsven,2012-09-30T20:54Z,"@ GavinFace, how dare you! How fucking dare you come on here and complain! So what if people have nothing better to do and want to download a shit copy of the movie. In time a better copy will come out, yes indeed. But for the time being it keeps people busy and entertained. My wofe and I just wached The Possession that we downloaded on here. It was a pretty good copy of the movie. We enjoyed it. That is why we RATE the video and audio. If you don't like it go download the DVD rip. But don't come in here and start pointing fingers and belittling fellow pirates."
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-30T21:36Z,"@Gavinface: Don't complain unless you can do better. Some cams are very watchable, some are pretty bad. But top quality, e.g. Blu-Ray, does not make a bad movie good. I'd rather watch a cam of a good movie than some crapper in HD. Get a clue."
,bean74,2012-09-30T21:58Z,"I just want to say to all those people who complain about any torrent that is legit...goto the movie theatre and don't visit this site....I say this as I have a great deal of respect for anyone who takes their time to create the torrent and upload for others to watch.

And GavinFace...  did someone pee in your cornflakes when you made that comment?  "
,beckham77,2012-09-30T23:36Z,Dark but watch able A7 V 5
,cwidder,2012-10-01T01:43Z,"GavinFace - you probably watched it, you retard and even if you didn't your face sucks."
,STLUGLY,2012-10-01T02:51Z,"Average quality cam, which is to be expected because.. it's a cam.   As poster stated, it is a little dark because of a majority of the film takes place in a (already) dark building. 

Only valid complaint:  ""morse code"" type clicks running around 50 bps steadily through most of the movie.  

Regardless,  watchable if you can drone out the clicks,  appreciate the up. "
,DreaD151,2012-10-03T15:20Z,Ok everyone we just uncovered a big conspiracy on pirate bays comments yes a conspiracy among pirates you know all these people like Gavinface and the dick weedz that comin in hear whining and cryin about how the cam that they waited so long for looked like it was recorded in a theater with a camcorder ? they are spammmers ... yes i know it shocked me too even if they dont say hey check out our site or version of the cam they are spammers in disguise yes these dick reamers only dis the hard work of Froggie and others to promote their own gay work but dont advertise as they post no no they use diversion! Ok all bullshit aside and jokes put away .... V6 A4 the morse code affect is removable with VLC and you can brighten it up too thanx froggie and everyone who puts their freedom at stake and dedicates their hardwork and time into making these so that me and the shit eaters like Gavinface may enjoy!
