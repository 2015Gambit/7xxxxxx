,MAD3X,2012-10-04T02:07Z,"cant get to install the bard's tale... I did the new OS update today, I wonder if its because of that, I did the update before installing the game. It's the first game from Manav that I can't get to install, I get an error 500 or something I dont remember."
,MAD3X,2012-10-04T13:36Z,"false alarm, it does work even with the new OS update, I hate to try a couple of times to load it, but now it works fine, thank you."
,Manav19,2012-10-04T19:04Z,"hello everyone....the bards tale is a huge game....so it takes a lot of time to transfer and then install it....its final size is near 4 gb...so pls be patient...u have to leave ur pb for about like an hr or so to let it finish...
