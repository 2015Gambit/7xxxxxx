Match of the Day Two 30.09.2012

Duration: 40 Min

Colin Murray introduces highlights of Sunday's Premier League match between Aston Villa and West Brom.

This Midlands derby pits together two clubs who have had differing starts to the season. The Baggies followed up a stunning opening day win over Liverpool with a point against Tottenham at White Hart Lane to give new manager Steve Clarke a dream introduction to life at West Brom.

The same cannot be said for Paul Lambert's opening matches in charge of Villa; he was able to bolster his thin-looking squad on deadline day, and now needs his side to pick up points to avoid being sucked into a relegation battle come the end of the season.

There is also the chance to catch up on all of the goals from Saturday's games.
