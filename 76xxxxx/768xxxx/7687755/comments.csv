,RedStripe777,2012-10-04T06:06Z,The models from this DVD will not play 4 me. Any one else having this problem?? I downloaded this .iso twice...same problem. It appears to play each clip for 0 secs!
,F3rarri89,2012-10-05T00:18Z,"Hey Redstripe777, yea im getting the same problem. I use the tester and I see the clips just skipping by like they arnt even clips. I have 2 different vghd programs and they both do the same.

Is it the program, the clips, not reading or something?

Captain, do you know how to fix this or whats causing it??"
,RedStripe777,2012-10-05T05:36Z,"Hey F3rarri89,

I am sure it is not the program. I've loaded several hundred models, all of which work except those in DVD 98.

Here's hoping Captain will look into it."
