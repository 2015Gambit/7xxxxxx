This was so difficult to 'Restore', and I'm still not really sure how good it looks. It's colored very strangely, very idiosyncratic. No consistency from page to page. Also, the original scans were very washed out and there was a ton of bleed through on some of the pages (so bad that I couldn't get rid of it 100% on a few of them). The 'Restoration' took so long and was so frustrating that I almost gave up on these Concrete books altogether. Instead I just put them to the side for a week and came back to them again this evening. I think they're passable, but they definitely don't look as good as the rest of the books.

Part of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader some of you may actually need to shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.
