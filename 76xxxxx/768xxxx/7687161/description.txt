=======================================


The Lost Time I Saw Pebbles

The Flintstones and Rubbles arrive at the 1964 New York World's Fair, where the kids promptly get lost. When Fred and Barney search for them - on a virtual tour of the Fair - the fathers get even more lost.


Retriever Stay 'Way from My Door

Dino falls in love with a fake brontosaurus at Sinclair's Dino Land, then goes into a frenzy of "retrieving" objects from all over the Fair. Fred tries to return the stolen items without getting caught.


On the Job Straining

Always hungry, Fred and Barney split from their wives to get some food, only to realize they have no money. Touring the Fair, Fred tries to earn money and stumbles intohairdressing.


That Was the Wreck That Was

Worn out by the Fair, Fred sleeps in the Rest Center. His touring-the-fair dreams are wilder than wild, but he wakes up in time for a ride on the monorail and the end-of-day fireworks.
