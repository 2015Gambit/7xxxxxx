Loving him couldnΓÇÖt be worse than losing him. Could it?

Candace Andrews has had enough of pleasing others. In an act of birthday rebellion, she sets out to please herselfΓÇöby walking into the tattoo parlor owned by her cousinΓÇÖs ex-boyfriend. All she wants is a little ink, and BrianΓÇÖs just the guy to give it to her.

As soon as she submits to his masterful hands, though, the forbidden attraction sheΓÇÖs always felt for him resurfacesΓÇªand she realizes the devilishly sexy artist could give her so much more.

Sweet, innocent Candace is the last person Brian expected to see again. SheΓÇÖs everything heΓÇÖs not, and her family despises him. He doesnΓÇÖt need the hassle, but he needs her, and this time no one is taking her away. Not even those who threaten to make his life a living hell.

Backed into a corner, Candace faces the worst kind of choice. Cave in to those who think Brian is a living nightmareΓÇªor hold her ground and risk it all for the one man who rocks her world.
