The most valuable thing in life is not money.
The most valuable things can’t be bought, sold, owned, speculated on, autographed or chipped of a wall. They aren’t things at all.
The most valuable thing in life is the fabric that connects us all: friendships, trust, empathy, love,… .
The Spiral is the most valuable work of art because you all shape it.
You can become a part of this work of art simply by connecting, sharing, playing and creating.
