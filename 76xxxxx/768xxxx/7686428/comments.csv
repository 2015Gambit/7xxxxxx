[V],NLUPPER002,2012-09-30T08:12Z,"@Tanlic i think u should go to the shop to get it.

Maybe it is a good plan to seed with 100kbps for u.

Take it ore leave it, its free and i alway seed long with big uploads.
The faster i seed the harder there run when completed, and u are a person that runs harder then everybody.
So get your pony and enjoy, but a camel will do the job."
