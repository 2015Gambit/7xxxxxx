Scary that part when Anonymous attacked that little group of nazi fools because they expressed their opinion. They were no threat to anyone and Anonymous destroyed their life becasue they didn't like what they had to say.
And then they attacked paypal for not supporting Wikileaks! Hmm. 
Fascism I think it's called. Internets Oligarks?


But still a good and interesting movie."
