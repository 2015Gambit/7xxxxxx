The OC
Season 3

The full season - all 25 episodes.

Great quality DVDRip



Ryan's saviour complex becomes a recipe for disaster. Seth and Summer's relationship hits the rocks thanks to Seth's compulsion to edit the truth. As Kirsten attempts to put her life back together, Sandy assumes leadership of the Newport Group and finds himself the heir-apparent to Caleb Nichols' legacy of scandal. Marissa spirals out of control after little sis Kaitlin - a Julie Cooper in the making - returns home to stir the pot. And speaking of Julie Cooper, she's cast out of her Palace - into the slums of the OC.

No sign of senioritis here. All 25 episodes lead to the most shocking season finale yet. With humour, heart, great music and all the teen angst you could hope for (and more), see why "The O.C. has become the John Hughes movie of the 2000s" (popmatters.com).
