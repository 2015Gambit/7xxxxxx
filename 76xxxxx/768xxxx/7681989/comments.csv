Downloaded and first to comment on quality here.
First up, this is still missing the first 10 minutes or so that were not there in CAM.
Secondly, the video looks the pretty much same as the CAM one with minor differences(hardly noticed).
Thirdly, audio is the best part of the upload. It is great and easily audible.
Overall, the movie is watchable if you want to miss out on the starting part. :)"
,daysaved,2012-09-29T10:46Z,How does no one understand that TS has nothing to do with the video? TS or Tele-Sync is a form of audio capture. Theaters run it along with the movie for the hearing impaired. TS is always CAM you just get the added bonus of getting good audio. 
,DreaD151,2012-09-29T17:02Z,correct thank god  for someone knowing what TS is i been preaching to these newbs for so long i feel like i need to start the Pirate Bay Technical College people dont understand that everyone gets the same copy to mold and shape into their own work and they all try to improve what their given kinda like fixin up a old car  and all these greedy leechers and new folks think that they are the ones recording the movies which maybe some are but not all of them do and people accuse them of copying others and crappy work well i hate when fucking people think they know how this works and the efforts of Froggie and others go unoticed thanks Froggie audio was awesome i gotta give it a V5 A8 for the cam and thank you for your time!
