,Anroid869,2012-10-01T07:44Z,Why the hell wont you..........SEEEEEED??
,SgtSlick,2012-10-03T18:19Z,"WOW, 2 seeders 65 Leechers.. Thats really selfish guys. Please at least seed for a little while so the torrent gets off the ground. I can only D/L it at 0.1-0.3 KBS  -  It will take me years to finish downloading it at this rate.."
,SgtSlick,2012-10-03T18:30Z,"Also Yui41: 
How come you don't mention SKSE?
What original Skyrim crack/download did you use?
What Dawnguard crack/download did you use?
Do you have any problems with conflicting mods?
Do you have any Dawnguard Animation problems? 
Thanks. "
,SgtSlick,2012-10-03T18:36Z,"Sorry one last question- 
Are these mods up to date?
Can you give details of your Nexus Mod Manager setup - things we may need to do inorder to get this mod setup to run properly. 
For example, you list SkyRe ~ Do you use ALL of the SkyRe options when activating the mod in the Mod Manager. 
If a user activates and selects SkyRe Races for instance will this lead to a conflict with; Gender and Race Heights & Lunari Race?
Details like this are important if the user is going to be able to play the game without it constantly crashing and/or being bugged to shit. "
,SgtSlick,2012-10-03T18:39Z,I wonder if it is possible to give us a .txt or .temp file for nexus mod manager or something along these lines so that this program can replicate your setup and we wouldn't need to jump through hoops and have to read 85 Mod instructions inorder to implement this properly. 
,thecats2011,2012-10-03T19:57Z,this is pretty much useless without a working tutorial
,LordMerkadis,2012-10-05T04:57Z,"Well people, before you all gonna start to bitch and QQ.. actually you already do.. anyways, since you bothered looking in here it means you're another lazy ass like all of us, just admit that theres just no way in bleedin' hell ya gonna go installin' 85 mods yourself, so.. point is, stfu and download."
,LordMerkadis,2012-10-05T05:20Z,"Wish i could download this btw, but no1 seeding this sh3t lmao. Can't believe 86 jerks actually got it with speed of zero lol."
