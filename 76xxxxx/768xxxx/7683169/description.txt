
The Rush Limbaugh Radio Show SEP-28-2012 FRI KLBJ-Austin LIVE MP3 56K

KLBJ = AUSTIN, TEXAS

THIS STATION WAS OK...NOT GREAT...SOME COMMERCIALS OVERLAPPED...NOT TOO BADLY THOUGH...

LBJ ??  JUST HAD TO LISTEN TO IT

SO FAR THE BEST STATIONS HAVE BEEN 
CHEYENNE, LUBBOCK, AND DALLAS

THE REALLY BEST STATION IS KNZZ COLORADO...GREAT STUDIO ENGINEER ALMOST NO COMMERCIAL OVERLAP...BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN TO CUTTING YOU OFF AFTER AN HOUR OR SO...BIG PROBLEM IF YOU LEAVE THE ROOM

BEING IN COLORADO I'M GOING ON THE THEORY THAT THE CLOSER THE STATION THE LESS CHANCE OF A DROPOUT SIGNAL LOSS..TEXAS,KANSAS,UTAH,WYOMING,NEW MEXICO,..I'LL KEEP EXPANDING...BECAUSE THAT MAY NOT BE ACCURATE

THE I-HEART RADIO NETWORK IS HUGE NOW...ABOUT 3/4 OF ALL STATIONS BUT THEY CONSTANTLY DROP OUT...SO YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK FOR ONES ON OTHER NETWORKS 

DENVER HAS A POWERHOUSE STATION BUT ITS ON THE I-HEART NETWORK FOR ONLINE LISTENING...I HAS CUT ME OFF MANY TIMES...AND IT ALSO STARTS 2 HOURS LATER

ENCLOSED IS A WEEKEND BONUS OF RUSH UPDATES


ALSO THERE IS A HAWAII STATION IN HONOLULU THAT STARTS AT 4PM EASTERN TIME
AND 10AM LOCAL TIME BECAUSE OF THE TIME DIFFERENCE  KHVH 830 IF WANT TO LISTEN AFTER RUSH IS OVER IN YOUR TOWN
