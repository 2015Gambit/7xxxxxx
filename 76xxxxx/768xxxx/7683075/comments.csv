,sdsucks,2012-09-29T08:45Z,"since this is a remux of the blu-ray, video must be untouched"
,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-09-29T09:09Z,"there is no russian audio and russian  subs,upload it in CEE"

Use a program called ""MediaInfo"" on the movie file after downloading a few MBs and it will tell you all the technical data about the file.

Since this is a 2.35:1 presentation I think it will be 1920x800."
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-09-29T09:53Z,"To clarify my previous comment, the resolution may be 1920x1080 but you WILL get black bars on a 16:9 display."
,captprice,2012-09-29T10:00Z,@EXPERIMENTONGOD-yes.. i think so too.
