Replaces yet another damaged LOL encode's Glitch @ 16:40

Most sources derive from LOL / DIMENSION (AFG, msd, etc ...)

Karma seems the exception - good encode from an independent source, but cannot re encode or CC2AVI (sound goes out of sync).

Wow - Gray!

Let's see, there's been green (pale green for '70s), red (my favorite), amber and now gray.

I like the depth of this show - please LOL, let someone else do this as yours are ALWAYS damaged ...
