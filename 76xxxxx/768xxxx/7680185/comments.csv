,dcarp85,2012-09-28T05:49Z,Thanks for the torrent but I hate these fucking canadian rips with 2.0 audio instead of DD5.1
,xtheghost,2012-09-28T05:54Z,"What a waste of time. It's 1 video file, why turn it into 19 RAR files..."
,Risko.,2012-09-28T19:00Z,Why is that a problem? With sceneline you don't have to worry about the quality of the torrent and unraring takes like five seconds.
