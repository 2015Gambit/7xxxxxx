Inherent to the teaching and practice of emergency medicine are specific challenges not found in other specialties - the unknowns of the emergency department, the need to identify life- and limb-threatening conditions, the pressure to solve problems and find solutions quickly, and the orchestration of clinical specialists and ancillary services.

Because of these unique demands, books written by clinicians from other disciplines, that extrapolate their information from other specialties, arenΓÇÖt always suitable references for teachers of emergency medicine. This book is different ΓÇô it shows how to incorporate effective teaching strategies into the unique teaching atmosphere of the emergency department, how to effectively lecture, lead small groups, give feedback, foster life-long faculty development skills, and much more ΓÇô it is written by emergency medicine physicians for emergency medicine physicians.

Practical Teaching in Emergency Medicine gets to the essential core of how to best teach the art of practicing emergency medicine ΓÇô and provides the blueprint to become a better teacher, providing guidance on how to accomplish skilful teaching in busy emergency departments. It provides emergency physicians and trainees with the necessary tools to effectively and efficiently transmit information to learners in the often times chaotic emergency department environment.
