=============================================

Armageddon's Children:


Logan Tom is doomed to remember the past and 

determined to rescue the future. Far behind him 

lies a boyhood cut violently short by his familyΓÇÖs 

slaughter, when the forces of madness and hate swept 

our world after decadent excesses led to civilizationΓÇÖs 

downfall. Somewhere ahead of him rests the only chance 

to beat back the minions of evil that are systematically 

killing and enslaving the last remnants of humanity. 

Navigating the scarred and poisoned landscape that once 

was America and guided by a powerful talisman, Logan has 

sworn an oath to seek out a remarkable being born of magic, 

possessed of untold abilities, and destined to lead the

final fight against darkness.

=============================================

The Elves of Cintra:


Across the ruined landscape that is AmericaΓÇôhopelessly 

poisoned, plague-ridden, burned, and besieged by demon 

armies bent on exterminating all mortal lifeΓÇôtwo pilgrims 

have been summoned to serve the embattled cause of good. 

Logan Tom has journeyed to desolate Seattle to protect a 

ragged band of street urchins and the being known as 

ΓÇ£the gypsy morph,ΓÇ¥ who is both mortal and magical, and 

destined to save mankind unless he is destroyed. Likewise, 

Angel Perez has her own quest, one that will take her 

from the wreckage of Los Angeles to a distant, secret 

place untouched by the horrors of the nationwide blightΓÇôa 

place where the race of Elves has dwelled since before 

man existed. But close behind these lone Knights of the 

Word swarm the ravening forces of the Void. 


=============================================

The Gypsy Morph:

Eighty years into the future, the United States is 

a no-manΓÇÖs-land: its landscape blighted by chemical 

warfare, pollution, and plague; its government collapsed; 

its citizens adrift, desperate, fighting to stay alive. 

In fortified compounds, survivors hold the line against 

wandering predators, rogue militias, and hideous mutations 

spawned from the toxic environment, while against them 

all stands an enemy neither mortal nor merciful: demons 

and their minions bent on slaughtering and subjugating 

the last of humankind.
