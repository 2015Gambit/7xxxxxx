i: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667889/

s: r4 dvd9

v: 976 kbps, 640x272, 23.976 fps
a: 128 kbps vbr mp3

r: 88 minutes

notes: Seriously,  if a supplier from a mp3  group  can get his hands on
       a big title like this from his  local videostore in his backwards
       town,  where are the rest of the scene movie groups?  I would pre
       the dvdr but I dont know the first thing about them, and it would
       probably get nuked like all the rest of dvdr releases these days.
