Could you please seed The Unusuals in 720p?"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-29T20:00Z,"I have not encoded Unusuals as 720p, as 480p I had have week ago and seeded to ratio 120!

I will seed next 24h my 480p in case you changed your mind."

,soslow7,2012-09-29T20:56Z,"Okaay. I thought you are getting 720p as a source for your 480p rips, or is this a direct SD rip from iTunes? Also you wrote that you even burned Unusualas for yourself, so it came to my mind that it was 720p.

By the way have you ever seen 720p Web-DL anywhere else ecxept on HDbits? I've seen LP's release(which means it's a repost from HDbits) on Usenet but the parts are already missing and because of retention time it's ureachable after all. I want it badly but don't have an acc on HDBits T__T .

Thank you for seeding 480p, I'll get it just in case, but I've almost finished downloading(only missing 7th ep.) old HDTV's from Dimension/CTU, I think they would be better that 480p, even if it's WEB-DL 480p. "
,param436,2012-09-30T00:41Z,pls upload x-files. pls pls

Dimension/CTU CAN'T be WEB-DL, but HDTV.

No, I encode to WEB-DL in 720p too.

No, WEB-DL sourc is not always from iTunes store.

No, 720p P2P are not always better than mine 480p. Some P3P 720p are unwatchable and  ugly, my 480p is always at least nice and decent.

Only ""problem"" is how my whole season IN 480 have SAME SIZE AS ONE SINGLE P2PWEB-DL

As you have too many things get wrong. I suggest you to avoid my 480p and waste bandwidth, time and money whenever you can. Just continue sending ""positive"" energy back to Universe."
