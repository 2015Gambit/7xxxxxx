Here's the complete September update. You can find both .package and .Sim3Packs in seperate folders in the torrent. The .sim3pack's decrapified, and rigfixed, of course.
It's a month set, not like shits on TPB (missing items, previous month items,etc), if you want to get ALL the updates released in current month, always take mine. 

So there's a FiXER_v5 folder in the torrent (which fixes the new bugged items), you have to use the .packages inside to get work some new items, which got fucked up, because of the decrapifier. If you do this right, everything is going to work. (see below)

******WARNING!!*******
IF YOU GOT FIXER_V3 OR 4 FROM MY PREVIOUS PACKS, YOU _MUST_ DELETE THIS FILE FROM YOUR OVERRIDES OR PACKAGES FOLDER **ccmerged_decrapped.package** !!!!! THIS IS IMPORTANT!!! DO THIS BEFORE YOU START COPYING THE NEW FIX FILES!
