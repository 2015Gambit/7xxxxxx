LOL is at it again:

Sadly, LOL cares not a whit for my favorite show as evidenced by:

Fringe.S05E01.Transilence.Thought.Unifier.Model-11.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4
Glitch @ 16:40"
,machspee,2012-09-29T18:50Z,"@MP4SUX: May I ask you to kindly please FUCK OFF? Pointing out the error or glitches is one thing but COMPLAINING is really pathetic and annoying for file sharing community.

If you really insist on 'perfect' quality downloads, wait for itunes or Amazon downloads and go fucking buy them, you moron

You get these for free and yet you whine how terrible the uploads are. Stupid fuck. "
,genocide44,2012-10-01T12:22Z,"machspee@ even though there free LOL uploads are poor quality rips and you dont need to abuse anyone for pointing out a glitch, and you dont need to swear watch your language.

there is a glitch @ 16:40  should be  fixed not ignored"
