From WikiEN:

Dr. Alexander Lowen (December 23, 1910 ΓÇô October 28, 2008) was an American psychotherapist. A student of Wilhelm Reich in the 1940s and early 1950s in New York, he developed Bioenergetic Analysis, a form of mind-body psychotherapy, with his then-colleague, John Pierrakos (February 8, 1921 ΓÇô February 1, 2001). Lowen was the founder and former executive director of the International Institute for Bioenergetic Analysis in New York City.
Born in New York City, Lowen received a bachelor's degree in science and business from City College of New York and an LLB from Brooklyn Law School. His interest in the link between the mind and the body developed during this time. He enrolled in a class on character analysis with Wilhelm Reich. After training to be a therapist himself, Lowen moved to Switzerland to attend the University of Geneva, which awarded him an M.D. in June, 1951.
