,tfox71,2012-09-30T09:07Z,"Well i just tried 3 or 4 different versions of fifa 13 and all gave me the authorization error or the disc error unreable. I dont have ihas cause its difficult to find firmware b, so i burn truncate with clonecd. i dont believe in the mp3 trick but i was desperate and tried with a usb pen full of music, i leave playing all time, i put the sound off and i played two times more than an hour and no errors. if people  that say its bulls**t how can you explain that? it worked for me!"
,barcules,2012-09-30T09:20Z,what language is the game??
,barcules,2012-09-30T09:25Z,does it still have all the errors like disc not authorized and unreadable?
,gman2288,2012-09-30T11:12Z,"The USB trick worked for me as well I was honestly shocked. What you have to do is first get a copy off Fifa 13 NTSC-U. Fuck this shitty ass torrent no one is seeding it I got Procision's torrent of FIFA 13 off some obscure website like tehparadox or something. Or you can download it from xbox360iso. Like I was saying if your xbox LT+ 3.O and your copy of fifa 13 is giving you unreadable disc or disc error this is what you do. Step 1 put music on a usb and shove that shit into your xbox doesnt matter if its an album or 1 song because it loops. Step 2 while listening to your music download install the game to your harddrive, doesnt matter if its truncated or not I dont have an ihas burner and i play all xgd3 games without it. Anyway I burned my fifa using truncate. Once the game is installed keep load up fifa and then BAM NIGGA! YOU BE PLAYING FIFA!! If you dont want to listen to your music on the usb you can actually turn the music off and still hear the I was previously getting errors almost after 5 minutes of trying to play fifa, and pro clubs wouldnt work. Now fifa 13 works perfect remember BEFORE YOU START PLAYING FIFA 13 you HAVE to play the music off your USB. THAT IS THE GLITCH!!!!!!! I dont know why it works but it works, try it out if you dont believe me. I thought that was the most ridiculous rumor ever, but it works.

PENIS!"

,fedep90,2012-10-04T07:36Z,"Para los que no tienen grabadora lite on y les sale error de disco. La unica forma de jugarlo es instalar el juego en el disco duro. Yo lo instale en un disco externo formateado por xbox. Despues de instalarlo, tenemos que tener otro disco o pendrive formateado en fat32 con musica en mp3 o wma. Con todo enchufado, vamos a mis aplicaciones y ponemos para escuchar la musica del pendrive. Con la música prendida le damos jugar. Ahora podemos jugar si que nos salga el famoso cartel de disco sucio,etc. Si quieren desp tocando el logo de xbox en el control podemos parar la musica en multimedia. Saludos!"
