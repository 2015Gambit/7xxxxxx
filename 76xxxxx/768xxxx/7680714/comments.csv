""Scandal"" is a new drama that centers on Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington), a former media relations consultant to the President who has the power to ""fix"" things for everyone. Now, she is on her own working for herself with a new law firm. However, as it always is, the past starts to come back into her life when slowly it is clear that her staff, who are specifically trained in fixing the lives of other people, can't seem to quite fix their own issues.
