The book is the one downloaded from the internet resources. It was around 60 MB in size; OCR'd and now the text is selectable (and searchable of course) and size is reduced to 1/10 of the original.

Don't forget the thanks if its better than other copies around. And please keep seeding, I don't have a full time internet available.
