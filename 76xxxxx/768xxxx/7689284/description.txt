Extreme Chat Relay V.1- the auto bot
I have worked many hours on this script.
It has tons of games,
including Trivia (with over 25 question files)
Uno
A huge assortment of popups, kickers, fun stuff, and much much more.
It also has a very impressive Access.ini file including four unique user levels.
A nice interface with dialogs, accessible from the menu,chat,and user area box.
I originally created this script to work in msnchat, many years ago.
However I have completely reworked it for IRC chat.
I must confess, it is not completely perfect, there are areas not compatible with IRC.
But, I feel it is worthy to share and any user can continue to edit the scripts to their own liking, and it preforms flawlessly.
Some of the scripts were made by other people, and they gave me complete permission to, edit,share, and do as I wish with them.
You also have my permission to do as you wish with the complete script.
Enjoy
If you are not familiar with irc scripts, the games and such are normally designed to work by remote access from your normal chat relay.
For instance, you can not play trivia from inside the script, you must be on a separate instance in the chat room.
This is the reason for the Access.ini file, you can give "permission" for other people to remotely access and control the script from their own chat relay.
