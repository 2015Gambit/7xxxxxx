If I were you I would look into the slavery of Islam! Did you know that Islam havent reformated away the slavery, as it is an part of the quran and hadiths? It was FORCED upon islam from the west. If you are born muslim then you cannot be slave though.

An black slave is called in arabic abid/abeed
An white slave is called in arabic mamluk.

There was castration of black slaves. So I find it hillarious that black people in the US leave christianity for Islam, although the slavery was HARDER and with castration in Islam.

People like Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X who didnt like the slavery of christianity and left it for Islam, an faith built around slavery, as even the father of the ""prophet"" was called abdullah, which means ""the slave of the god Allah"".

I had respect for Malcolm X but this notion shows that he had no information at all about the history of Islam other than what the Imams wanted him to know.

We must fight Islam with knowledge! Question the Quran even harder than the Bible, as the islamists see the secularism of the west as an weakness. Show them that an free mind isnt an weakness, but an strength far greater than threats of terror!"

I agree with you, as there are moderate muslims who condemn attacks on their religion but do not react violently, there are MANY MORE who kill, beat up, offer contract killings, etc. whenever something against islam is published.

I believe that those barbarian backward fanatics must be taught tolerance and the meaning of personal freedom which they are not familiar with.

If many thousands of people in the west make fun of their beliefs and of them the strong way I did here, they will get used to it and finally accept there is nothing they can do to stop any sort of criticism, however exaggerated and unfair it may be.

Let's call it 'shock treatment' and I assure you that in the long run, it would work to civilize them a bit, if not through reason, through persistent repetition they are powerless to stop.

In the meantime, your approach can continue so muslims know what critics think and can decide whether to stay muslims or leave that religion.

,raenkae,2012-09-29T23:11Z,"sakstroy: In march 2009 United Nations Human Rights Council made an resolution that condemn critique of religions. It was adopted on initiativ of a group of ""muslim countries"". The resolution says among other things: ""Slander of religions is an serious insult which can make less freedom of religion and increased religious violence.""

The humanists and twohundred other ideal organisations have protested, due to its impact on free speech.

This shows who we are dealing with. The saudi family have a lots of oil among other muslim theocrats. They have all the money, and the will to rule the mind of humanity. The UN can obviously be bought, just as all the goverments of the west.

Although I translated the resolution from another language. The problem is that mostly those that have the money, they set the agenda. That is why the saudi family is funding new mosques all over Europe today, fundings that come with strings. They want that the extreme and hostile saudi wahhabism/salafism shall reign supreme over the world!

I object to this, but we cannot go the way of xenophobes. We must use reasoning, so people will not put us in the same group! "

Yes, but bear in mind that as it has already been pointed put, those fanatics see any timidity and exaggerated respect from westerners as COWARDICE AND WEAKNESS, let's show them that this is not the case.
