You have the 5.5 GB, the 3.4 GB, and this 2.6 GB one.
The resolution is the same on all 3 of them, so what else is the difference other than the DTS audio?"
,topk,2012-09-28T17:31Z,Is this the complete movie or just the extras and vignettes?
,rsl87,2012-09-28T18:30Z,^ all both of you need to do is read the info instead of asking pointless questions. This is the extras not the movie itself... says right in the info
,rsl87,2012-09-28T18:31Z,PS. thanks for uploading the extras BOZX! 
,ECCHiDUCKi,2012-09-28T18:53Z,"no it is not a full movie, it is the bonus extras on disc containing deleted scenes and alternate intro/ending and a bit about Weyaland company"

After watching all of the deleted scenes and the alternate ending, it's no wonder that no director's cut or extended cut ended up being made.  Maybe all or even parts of a couple of the deleted scenes were good enough to deserve being included in the movie, but that's it, and the alternate ending was definitely lame.  "

Good movie to kill some time, if you have absolutely nothing to do. "
