A viral video of an Obama supporter touting her ΓÇ£Obama phoneΓÇ¥ has put the spotlight on an obscure federal program that provides discounted phone service to qualifying low-income Americans.

ΓÇ£Keep Obama as president,ΓÇ¥ the animated woman says on the video. ΓÇ£He gave us a phone.ΓÇ¥

The video is drawing attention to the government program ΓÇö Lifeline ΓÇö as a national debate unfolds on entitlements and the growing percentage of Americans who pay no income taxes and get a long menu of government benefits. But even though some beneficiaries may credit President Obama for providing the phones, Lifeline is an extension of a program that has existed since 1985. Still, critics including Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., note the program has swelled from $772 million in 2008 to $1.6 billion.

ΓÇ£It's a government-run, taxpayer-funded program that's running wild and costing more and more,ΓÇ¥ reads GriffinΓÇÖs official House of Representatives website.
