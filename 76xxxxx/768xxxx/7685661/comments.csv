,rjamesbe,2012-09-30T19:01Z,This is not a blu-ray rip.. Aspect ratio is not as it should be.. I started watching it with my kid but to bad to continue.. better wait for a real blu-ray rip.
,cha0zix,2012-10-01T11:02Z,its not 720p. But its watchable
,bzerkkker,2012-10-03T15:23Z,"The DVD rips out there have way better A/V quality than this. 

Definitely not worth the download, horrible video and audio quality, deleted."
