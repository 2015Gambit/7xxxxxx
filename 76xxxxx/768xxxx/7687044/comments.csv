However, I really enjoy the quad mixes and would really appriciate it if cyberdogsid would be so kind as to seed his Wish You Were Here Quad torrent.  It's stuck at 72% and has had dozens of people trying to download it but are not able to since no one seems to have a full copy of it.  If it's too much to ask of cyberdogsid, then perhaps someone who has the full thing could put it up again?  thanks."
