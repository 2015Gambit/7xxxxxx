Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs vinyl version ripped with $27000 worth of analog gear.

In my opinion the best version out there to listen to....

Turntable: SME 20/2 
Arm: SME V 
Cartridge: Koetsu Rosewood Platinum Signature 
Tube Pre-amp: Audio Research LS22 $4000
Phono: Krell KPE Reference phono board

Enjoy...
