How come the audio is always terrible with Doctor Who ? This episode was even worse..."
,trace535,2012-09-30T05:06Z,"The audio is 315 kbps 6 channels AAC.

Stop kvetching."
,fiendy76,2012-09-30T05:08Z,"If you're using VLC, adjust the audio in the eq setting and use dual pass. It make it sound much better."

I usually stream from my computer to my xbox 360 via the video player, however this one did not work.
It did stream to my xbox through media player though.

Super big thanks EZTV and please send the thanks up the line to everyone who made it possible."
