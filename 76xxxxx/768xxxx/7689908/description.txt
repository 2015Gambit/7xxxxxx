On The Beach At Waikiki, 1914-1952 (Harlequin) [FALC] {MKOP}

One of several Hawaiian compilations in this series, this is another impressive set of Hawaiian rarities... Especially striking are the trio of First World War-era recordings, which demonstrate that the flashy pyrotechnic style of Hawaiian steel guitar had been established very early on. This disc is a bit less varied stylistically, though, and may be less rewarding than its companion discs, in terms of enjoying it's still super-cool.~DJ Joe Sixpack
