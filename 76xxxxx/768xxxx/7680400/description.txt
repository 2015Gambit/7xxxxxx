Description

War has erupted on the lonely planet of Ishtonia IV. Humans and a sentient mechanical alien race known as the Zali - former collaborators in the mining and processing of the rare compound, Lohum - now see each other as threats to their continued existence on this planet

The mysterious Zali move as one while the Humans find themselves fractured in the face of adversity. A group of Rebels led by an enigmatic leader Aeryn Ozarr, fights against their governing body known as the Command; and it's this body that finds that it is fighting on two fronts and slowly losing the ability to hold either

Enter Oliver Petrovich, the son of the Command's Overseer and reluctant participant in a game long set. He wasn't bred for war but his father insists that he, like all his fore-fathers, `has it in him'. Trying to cope with the mounting pressure of being in command and still trying to understand his part in the war, Oliver will soon find that the Ishtonian Wars will bring out more than just the soldier in him
