The original NTSC version for the amazingly awesome videogame Ico by Fumito Ueda, for PlayStation 2.

This NTSC-only CD version don't show fog walls when emulated with PCSX2 emulator in hardware mode! PAL/NTSC DVD version do creates annoying gray walls in botch modes. Just make sure to use scaling for internal resolution with GSdx (4x, for example) to avoid double image or ghosting effect (well, in fact it's a graphical bug caused by unsupported internal resolution) with NTSC edition and make and extrasharp image and HD gaming. And that's it!!

Seed as much as you can, at least a ratio of 1!

Enjoy!
