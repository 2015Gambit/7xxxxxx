Information
------------------------------

From the sea horse that mates in an hypnotic underwater ballet to the rodent who copulates until he literally drops dead, THE NATURE OF SEX spans the globe to illustrate how an astonishing diversity of life forms find their mates and conceive, raise, and protect their offspring. This Web companion to the four-part series takes a close look at the primal instinct that causes animals to come together in order to pass along their genes to the next generation. We also examine how timing can be key in the mating process, and how varied sex contracts create not only new life, but diversity, in both animals and humans.

5)  A Miracle in the Making 
This fifth volume of PBS's THE NATURE OF SEX series continues with its illuminating look at the natural drive for sexual relations. The episode focuses on the variety of ways animals deal with mating, child bearing and birth.
In this episode, the filmmakers turn their sights on the complicated human species. So many choices, so little time, might be the mantra of modern man. The role that changing social mores play in sexual behavior is examined. There is a humorous, insightful look at human sexual attraction, from perfumes and clothing to money and power. From pheromones to the tango, the human animal proves to be a very interesting subject.
