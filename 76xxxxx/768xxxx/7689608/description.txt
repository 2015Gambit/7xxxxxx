Until 10 February 1971 was released this was the earliest Patti recording I'd seen.

Lineage: FM SBD recording of otherwise unknown lineage--CDR I received by mail--EAC--Sound Forge--FLAC(level 8)

SQ:  Not good, I rate it "C-".  Downloaded about six hundred times on Demonoid.

In the full NFO you will see mention of an alternate, inferior source.  See a comparison at   http://bayimg.com/paDlDAaEf   (this source is on the bottom, the inferior Dime source is on the top; spectrals of the whole recording, and two seconds of it, are on the left and middle, with peaks on the right)
