The downloaded file was an ""unknown"" file format, NOT even media file !!! So i chose BIT Torrent again with what I got no problem..."

If there's no extension on the file which looks like this when it's finished : Strike Back S03E08 HDTV x264-EVOLVE [eztv] just add a full stop then avi and it works. If you can't then where you have saved the file go to Tools at the top the go folder options/view and file and folder options will open and un-click ""hide extensions for known file types"". close it then you will be able to rename the file."
,SrMLove,2012-10-04T03:14Z,"i had the same problem(s)/issues(s)....try restarting your computer,disconnect your internet, and hard reset your router. Just reconnect your router and reconnect to the internet. Basically just restart everything and then do everything you would normally do to D/L a torrent.... that fixed everything for me... i don't know which step did it... but that is what i usually do when i am having internet issues that others are not having( I.E.- TPB is officially back up and working and others are successfully downloading... and that wasn't the same case for me. so i did that troubleshooting that i explained ^^ up above^^.... i hoped i helped you... b/c no one helped me :/"
