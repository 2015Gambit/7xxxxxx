"Unrecognised Potntial" by R Ravi Kumar, a graduate from IIT Kharagpur is a story of four friends focused on one of them whose hope, inspiration and courage laid a road of success and opportunities for ignorant people of a village. With its contrasting characters set against the backdrop of two contrasting locations, the story highlights the unrecognised potential of our neglected rural areas featuring the struggle between the rich and the poor, the love and the lust and our wants and the responsibilities.
