,BlackyX,2012-10-03T13:54Z,"Thank you so much!
Any hope on getting Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition soon?"
,BuzzB,2012-10-04T00:08Z,"Thank you elmalvado you are truly awesome!

I would also be curious to know if you are working on RotRLAE at all, running it via Hardcover now but the PDF would make life just that much simpler for prep.

More curious if its in the works than when it would be ready."
,elmalvado,2012-10-04T20:31Z,"@BuzzB - Thanks. I'm just a humble releaser / seeder :)

I know what you mean. I'm running RotRL using HC and it's not very comfortable. I hope that someone will buy & share this pdf soon."
