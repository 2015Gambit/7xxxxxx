,shamanist,2012-09-28T20:52Z,Poor Niall!!! Saw him and Krugman debate. Niall was splattered across the hall. Then there was that embarrassing article he did for newsweek. Krugman and many others took him to task for that piece of sodden trash. Noticed he stayed out of the limelight for a while after that. Hope this is better...
