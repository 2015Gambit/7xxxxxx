,skliniasa,2012-09-29T22:59Z,thanks but where are the subtitles ?
,ShinDach,2012-09-29T23:24Z,there should be another file in the folder with the same name as the video. keep them together to have the subs. if you do and the subs are still not showing make sure the files are named the same.
,Anaklusmos1995,2012-09-30T00:29Z,My file didn't come with any subtitle....
,falafelface,2012-09-30T04:12Z,"yeah, no sub with this"
,falafelface,2012-09-30T04:22Z,"there's a bunch to choose here:

this one works for this rip:

when the sub has a file name different from the video name, i don't bother to change it because you can simply browse and open the subtitle file from your player... well, at least in vlc"
