,Seneedra,2012-09-29T22:43Z,what do I patch it to? When I start the patch it goes to two file within the program file. 
,tktheng,2012-09-30T07:02Z,work for me
,thriftstoretalent,2012-10-03T20:29Z,where to apply the patch? no instructions included fail
,thriftstoretalent,2012-10-03T20:33Z,"nvm. i figured it out on my own. go to the location of bad piggies in your hard drive. mine is: C:/>program files>rovio>bad piggies>, then copy and paste the crack file directly into the bad piggies directory.(the search feature doesn't work on the patch app, so you HAVE to do it this way), then run the patch from the bad piggies directory. you should get a pop up that says successfully patched."
