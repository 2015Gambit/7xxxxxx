""what a Hell is going on eztv ?! I trusted you ! this file is NOT openable with ANY media player !!!""

Someone needs codecs, it would seem -- file works on all three of my media players. 

Great upload - glad the show is back! "

,lovecat66,2012-09-29T10:46Z,"why is there serious problem downloading THIS and many other ""magnet links"" when I use U-torrent ?! Even when I used the MOST up-to-date version ?! The downloaded file was an ""unknown"" file format, NOT even media file !!! So i chose BIT Torrent again with what I got no problem..."

,MADDON752,2012-09-30T23:57Z,I have had similar problems with utorrent. my bittorrent works really well after a few tweaks that some poeple have posted in thier comments thanks a lot. Such as setting  my per torrent connections to 500 and forcing outgoing encryption. This can be done in the preferences part of bittorrent. Thank you or another great download.
