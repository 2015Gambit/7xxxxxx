"R.S.V.P."

10-20-01 Los Angeles, CA

This special Bashar event is the first channeling since 1998. Bashar shares a new perspective on the dramatic changes occurring on our planet. He calls this session RSVP as it is an invitation for us to decide whether we want to have contact with extraterrestrial civilizations.

Q&A includes questions about 9/11 and personal experiences the audience has had with ET contact as well as personal issues individuals are seeking assistance with.
