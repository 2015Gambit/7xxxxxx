"Broken"

Reality and myth begin to merge as the fairytale 
characters awaken from Evil Queen Regina's 
broken curse and remember who they were. But to 
their dismay, they aren't transported back to 
fairytale land. To make matters worse, 
Rumplestiltskin - aka Mr. Gold - in an effort to 
gain the upper hand in his power struggle with 
Regina, has introduced magic into the town. In 
fairytales magic has its place, but in our world 
it can have unfathomable consequences. 
Meanwhile, back in the fairytale land, Prince 
Phillip awakens his sleeping beauty, Aurora, but 
discovers that he and his traveling companion, 
Mulan, will soon have to face a deadly foe.
