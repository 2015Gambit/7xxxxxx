In Spain the Blu-ray release date is the 5th of December (!). Fuck that shit! I already saw this on theaters and just want to see it once more.

,duriotic,2012-09-29T18:25Z,Oh wow...7.1!!!  It's gonna kill me to wait for the EXTENDED 1080p version now.  And now I have to hope it gets the 7.1 Eng soundtrack treatment as well!!! BOZX:  ARE YOU LISTENING???  :~)  Thanks in advance.
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-09-30T12:31Z,"Solution for playing Blu-ray folders with PowerDVD:

You need the following folder structure:

BDMV
----AUXDATA
----BACKUP
----------BDJO
----------CLIPINF
----------JAR
----------PLAYLIST
----BDJO
----CLIPINF
----JAR
----META
----PLAYLIST
----STREAM
CERTIFICATE

For this release, just create an empty folder called ""AUXDATA"" inside the ""BDMV"" folder and it will play perfectly."
