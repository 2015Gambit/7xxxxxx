,medicpo,2012-09-29T01:09Z,"cool but, these are lv50 at start of game pt1 right? is there anyway we can get a set of pt 2.5 50's? "
,tops.c,2012-09-29T13:55Z,"lol, actually the game's pretty hard (can't find good guns) same as the 1st BL,  I was able to jump into a LAN game and grab a few Lv 50 guns and starting from the 1st it's just 1 shot kills all the way, I miss my old green acid LMG, I want to mod the E-Tech gun I figured out how to save it, gun mod tool very soon.

,guccicar,2012-09-30T03:23Z,Where are the seeders?
,tops.c,2012-10-01T13:33Z,"Dude I could never get my own seed started that's why I posted the (source site), still no gun modding tool or save editor out yet that will mod guns just Lv, skill points, Badass points, and money $$.

Will try another up and call it Rev.1 when I get some XP guns."
