,reelook,2012-09-30T11:30Z,still not works asshole....
,Catalynnn,2012-09-30T14:21Z,"Let's not be rude ... I'm sure the uploader meant well, it's just that this upload is of no use. Again, you can download Kaspersky software from their site for free, and you also get a free month trial, all is needed here is a working key. The key provided probably works to install the software included in the torrent, but once you update the virus data base the key gets blocked since is already black listed."
[T],YahSoft,2012-09-30T20:07Z,"Friends, the series worked with me.
Another option is to visit my page on TBT, Kaspersky Resetter, it's 30 days of use. So do not freak out. If someone can not download from my page, look for another, surely it will be Resetter. I do not want fame to this page TPB's also the motto pirated content is free and anonymous. Just do what I can. Do not like, do better."
