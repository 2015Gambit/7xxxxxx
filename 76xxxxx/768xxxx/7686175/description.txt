Ken Mercer is a street performer working in the streets of Forence (Italy) more exactly  outside of the Uffizi Gallery, for almost 14 years. I met him one chilly night in 2006: after dinner i was near The Uffizzi Gallery when i listen the music. Instantly i though Paul Simon performing in Florence...? He began his career in the streets of New York where he met Art Garfunkel, who encouraged him to continue his career as an artist. This is his first Album.
I would like you to listen carefully the song called Why?- Do you think by any chance that's a Paul Simon's song? Believe it or not the song and music are by Ken Mercer!
