MP3s sound horrible and every RIP of Saturate and Dear Agony on here is just flat out horrible sounding. If you have not heard much or any of Breaking Benjamins music this is the torrent to get. All tags complete and ready to be either burnt to CD or integrated with iTunes, the qualities outstanding and the file size doesn't break the hard drive/SDD."
