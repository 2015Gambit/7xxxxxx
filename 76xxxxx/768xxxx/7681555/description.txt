From the Preface:

Organization and Approach 

The text, like the year-long course, links chronology, themes, 
and geography in eight units, or parts of study. The parts 
move progressively along a time line from the emergence of 
early humans to the present day. Each part emphasizes a 
single theme-for example, urbanization or religion or trade 
-and students learn to use all eight themes to analyze his- 
torical events and to develop a grasp of the chronology of 
human development. Geographically, each part cover the 
entire globe, although specific topics place greater emphasis 
on specific regions.
