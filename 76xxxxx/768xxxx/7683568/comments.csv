,rsvuk95,2012-09-29T18:33Z,Is it posible for us to get PC NBA 2K13 earlier then 2 october ???
,gordhorde,2012-09-29T18:47Z,P_Geezy - Thanks I didn't know about that the TRUNCATE didn't work anymore - BUT you should just buy a iHAS (anynumber ) burner and then burns 100% of the game cause sooner or later they are going to put that empty space in the middle and then the last part of the disc will be the part of the game and it will not play - Just a heads up - been reading that on forums and the iHas 124 burner only cost $50 cdn after shipping and taxes
,dudy23,2012-09-29T19:15Z,"Game officially releases on 2 october, but I think 2 october is date both for PC and XBOX, so if XBOX was released today I think that we should get crack for PC little earlier"
,Bossman112,2012-09-29T19:37Z,"so should I truncate it or overburn it?
truncate has worked good for me so far,but I have never tried overburn."

,Melo22,2012-09-29T21:04Z,Hope this comes with a burn guide. I've been burning games for years now. And I'm not really sure about this overburn/trunacate thing you guys speak about. I'll just try once disc then if that fails I'll google.
,dj72989,2012-09-29T23:02Z,is there anyway we can get the all star weekend DLC?

,P_Greezy,2012-09-30T00:06Z,"@gordhorde - I understand but this method has worked for every xgd3 game playing perfectly offline and i really dont see the need for an ihas drive at the moment, Hope the OVERBURN method works for whoever doesnt have a ihas and wants to play the game offline, enjoy!"
,Carri00r,2012-09-30T02:24Z,what do i need to play it on my xbox360

,xbox87,2012-09-30T04:29Z,The truncate method does not work for alot of games anymore. I suggest you guys buy a Liteon IHAS drive and flash it for perfect burns. I bought mine from newegg for cheap. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&N=-1&isNodeId=1&Description=liteon+ihas&x=0&y=0
,adefex24,2012-09-30T05:26Z,"when i load the game it says ""this game requires and update, but the update could not be found"".......help please anyone..thanks"
,punkfreak123,2012-09-30T06:23Z,Burns and plays fine with no issues with Ihas burner and Verbatim discs.
,pspcow,2012-09-30T07:43Z,"F*cking Justin Bieber in the game WHAT THE F*CK!!! His team is actually one of the best in the game DOUBLE F*CK! Apart from that, the Dream Team makes this game absolutely amazing.  "
,Bossman112,2012-09-30T08:31Z,truncate seems to be working so far!!!
,Barncore,2012-09-30T08:50Z,Patiently awaiting PC release! PC PC PC PC PC PC!!

,Melo22,2012-09-30T15:16Z,"Hey guys I used the truncate way of burning the game of a guide I found on youtube. I could boot up the game play for a little while. But i noticed that my driver was making an odd noise kinda like it was scrachin the disc and after about 5 minutes the game said ""failed to verifie"" something something. Anyone mind helping me with this? I did not use a Ihas burner but it seemed to be working fine! its really odd. Any help would be great"
,jascha37,2012-09-30T15:17Z,NOW SEEDING! :)
,medina191,2012-09-30T17:02Z,for all those who say that the trunicate method doesnt work thats all a bunch of bs.....just play music off your xbox (doesnt matter if it is usb or harddrive i know because ive used both) for about 5 min and you should be fine
,P_Greezy,2012-09-30T18:48Z,"@medina191-What I mean is truncate doesnt work anymore unless you do a trick, and for most ppl the trick doesnt work, the only way to play without having to do any trick is to OVERBURN trust me it works for every xgd3 game out there, try it out if you dont belive me, its the most hassle free way to get your games working without ihas."
,Bossman112,2012-09-30T19:16Z,"I used truncate method and it works perfect,I didn't use any usb song trick,everything just works the way it is."
,dj72989,2012-09-30T19:18Z,everyone needs to invest in a IHAS burner and Verbatim DVD's. It will make your life so much easier when it comes to burning XDG3 games. I was stubborn at first and decided I can just truncate or overburn but eventually that method will no longer work. burns work every single time with Ihas.
,Usaidomg,2012-09-30T21:56Z,I dont have an ihas burner but im using imgburn...would this still work if i use the truncate option and download the game properly?
,86ETA,2012-09-30T22:13Z,"Downloading finish !

Now Seeding   ;))  


Btw Truncate metod is dead guys !!!!  Buy Ihas and burn like a boss    :) "

,Assassinprofessor,2012-09-30T23:22Z,"im on LT 2.0 and it asks for an update, both NBA and Fifa 13 but not Resident Evil 6..if i update my dash will i be able to play the games"
,IAMFTW23,2012-10-01T02:45Z,"hey, if i burn before release and i play offline, will i have to re-burn game when it gets verified to play safely online? plz reply! "
,P_Greezy,2012-10-01T03:19Z,@IAMFTW23 Yes! You will have to reburn when verified in the agbx database. 
,qxPROxp,2012-10-01T08:54Z,"@IAMFTW23 No you dont, i never have and none of my friends do it is waste of DVD. "
,P_Greezy,2012-10-01T14:33Z,"@qxPROxp - Stop with your bs and givin out false info, that is a easy way to get your xbox banned, inorder to play this safetly online you have to reburn because its not in the abgx database so its not safe to play online, wait untill the official release date then it will be verified, however, if you wanna continue to play offline then there is no need to reburn another copy."
,f393,2012-10-03T13:08Z,"Game is working great!!!
