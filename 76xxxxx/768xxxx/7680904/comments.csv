,medina191,2012-09-28T19:52Z,does this work?
,carlosasantosr,2012-09-28T20:23Z,"@IgOR360BR No entiendo mucho de portugués. No sé si tú entiendas español, ¿pero me puedes ayudar con el problema? No tengo grabadora iHAS.

Can you help me with the game? I don't have a iHAS burner. "
,DanQuiros,2012-09-28T21:15Z,"I have an iHas324 B burner oatched with BurnerMax tho. It works flawless so far, and I've been playing for a long time now in all modes including career."
,DanQuiros,2012-09-28T21:21Z,"Make sure you run the .iso through abgx360 to fix topology data and any other error it may have. There's no verified rip on the Xex/SS online data base yet, but I asure you its working perfect for me.
I had issues with other games like DarksidersII, and I got it to work using a simple (not patched) burner and using the ""truncate"" option instead of ""overburn"", somehow it worked. For those people without iHas, give that a try...."
,Acemodz,2012-09-28T22:10Z,it works for me maybe u need to run through abgx i run all my ISO through it weather patch is out or not u need to patch the topilogy 
,carlosasantosr,2012-09-29T04:58Z,"@DanQuiros O.K. I'm gonna try it. I don't even care if doesn't work the career mode. I'll be satisfied if the game lets me move in the menu without that fucking ""disk read error"" or another warning. This version has the Latin American commentators, right? Thanks a lot. "
,Usaidomg,2012-09-29T17:01Z,It says no verified rip of xex crc b24c8e78 in the online database. Does this affect the game and is it still stealth patched? 
,carlosasantosr,2012-09-29T23:31Z,I'm already downloading. Someone tried with truncate mode with a regular burner? 
,carlosasantosr,2012-09-30T04:03Z,@DanQuiros This version has Latin American commentaries? 
,rangahang,2012-09-30T13:44Z,TOO LITTLE SEEDERS HOLY CRAP... STUCK AT 0% FOR THE WHOLE DAY...!!!
,Usaidomg,2012-09-30T21:55Z,"Im using img burner..i downloaded one copy and it worked using trunate option, but now when i try to get another copy it says an error on imgburn. Can anyone help me with this problem or tell me whats the issue?"
,mbellini,2012-10-03T19:49Z,This version is in Brazilian Portuguese?
