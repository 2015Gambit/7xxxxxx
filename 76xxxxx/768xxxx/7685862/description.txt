POtHS Comment:  This series is for brushing up on your Survival Skills. World War 3 is upon us, This fact can not be denied by anyone with a ┬╝ of a Brain. When War breaks out everything else breaks down. No Electricity will bring America and all Major Powers to their KNEES. (EMP) Third World Countries will be least affected as their dependence on electricity is much less. NO Electricity means NO fuel, pumps are electric. No electricity means no infrastructure, NO WATER, NO FOOD, NO MEDICINE, NO CARS, NO POLICE, NO FIRE DEPARTMENT, NO AMBULANCES, NO HOSPITALS, NO SCHOOLS, NO WORK, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO Things No NOTHING!!!

Katrina showed us that in 3 days with no Food or Water people start killing each other. How long till they start eating ΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇªΓÇª.you!!!

WE WILL BE UNDER MARSHAL LAW. The LAW wonΓÇÖt have gas after awhile either and Marshal Law will Break Down. You will be on your own. Are you ready for any of the tribulation that is coming our way? Me neither. The RAPTURE will take some of us away from all that. Are you one of them that does not have to worry about all that? I am. I am putting this out for all those that are left behind when the Rapture occurs and DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST AND WANTS TO SURVIVE THE TRIBULATION and live with Jesus in Eternity.


Description:  

"Believe it or not, I was so impressed with this series of videos that it was one of the reasons I started CampingSurvival.com. Being a former Marine and outdoors enthusiast, I greatly appreciate the excellent job Ron and Karen Hood do of sharing their vast knowledge of camping and survival skills. However, despite all that they teach in every video, I still find them to be very entertaining as well. These videos are so enjoyable that they make me long for Spring even before winter has started! Buy one and I guarantee you'll want to buy them all!"-Tom Sciacca President JHL Supply / CampingSurvival.com
