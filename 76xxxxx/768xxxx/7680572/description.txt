Hey guys/gals all credit to original scanners/uploaders of course!

This is the Walking Dead (cbr) and complete/up to date 1-102... sorry no survival guide since its kinda pointless (my opinion)

FYI

All Walking Dead issues from 1 to 96 are in TRADE PAPERBACK FORMAT !!!!!!!!!!!!

That's vol 1 to vol 15 and the rest are single issue releases including #100 with 13 extra variant covers!!!!

Guys this is a great series and if u wanna see season 3 FOR REALS then read the comic first!!!!


Enjoy, SEED :) (And tell me if its wrong in anyway this is my first big upload)
