,MVC78,2012-09-28T23:05Z,"Ugg the Pusher trilogy did NOT need a remake. Don't even bother with this derivative London dribble. Do yourself a favor and go search for the original Pusher movie right NOW!

Anyways, thanks for the up, Gh0st :D"
,Buccaneer650,2012-09-28T23:12Z,"Yes, the Danish originals are sublime...

Here is the original, along with the two sequels. If the subtitles don't work just make sure they are in the same folder as the movie file and have the same name... e.g. Pusher1.avi needs subtitles to be called Pusher1.srt - that's what VLC seems to like best, as does my Sumvision media player.
