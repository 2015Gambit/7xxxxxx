====================================================

Jarka Ruus:


Twenty years have passed since Grianne Ohmsford denounced 

her former life as the dreaded Ilse WitchΓÇösaved by the 

love of her brother, the magic of the Sword of Shannara, 

and the destruction of her evil mentor, the Morgawr. Now, 

fulfilling the destiny predicted for her, she has established 

the Third Druid Council, and dedicated herself to its goals 

of peace, harmony among the races, and defense of the Four 

Lands. But the political intrigue, secret treachery, and 

sinister deeds that have haunted Druid history for generations 

continue to thrive. And despite her devotion to the greater 

good as Ard RhysΓÇöthe High Druid of Paranor, Grianne still has 

bitter enemies. 

====================================================

Tanequil:

Dark magic has opened a gateway to the Forbidding and trapped 

within it Grianne Ohmsford, rightful High Druid of Shannara. 

Rescuing Grianne will be merely the beginning of the effort to 

return the Four Lands to some semblance of peace. Only her 

young nephew, Penderrin, has any hope of returning her to 

power. But to breach the Forbidding and bring Grianne back 

to the natural world, Pen must find the fabled Tanequil . . . 

and the talisman it alone can provide. That means journeying 

into the InkrimΓÇôa dreaded region thick with shadows and haunted 

by harrowing legends. And there, Pen will strike a bargain 

more dire than he could ever imagine. 

====================================================


Straken:


The High Druid of Shannara trilogy draws to a thrilling 

close as a young hero nears completion of his trial by fire, 

a banished ruler fights for her life in a wilderness of dread, 

and forces of darkness and light square off in a battle unto 

death for the right to absolute rule. Prepare to be spellbound 

by the masterly hand of bestselling legend weaver Terry Brooks, 

conjuring at the peak of his skills.
