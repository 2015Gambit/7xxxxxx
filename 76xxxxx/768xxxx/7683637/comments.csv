You can take the girl out of Jersey, but you can’t take Jersey out of the girl. When a brassy street-wise lawyer joins a posh Manhattan law firm, she lowers expectations at first sight. But, despite her white-collar colleagues’ skepticism and her Italian family’s well-meaning but constant intrusions, she rises to the challenge. She defends her clients with her distinct brand of legal strategy, intelligence, and Jersey attitude. (Source: CBS TV)
