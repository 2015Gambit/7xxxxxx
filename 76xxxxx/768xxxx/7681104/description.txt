 The series is one of the most expensive television shows in Greek television history with a budget of Γé¼4 million.[1][2] The Island author Victoria Hislop had previously received offers from Hollywood as high as ┬ú300,000 for the movie rights to the novel, although she opted instead to grant the rights to Mega Channel for a fraction of the price in return for some artistic control.[3]
 Initial thoughts by Mega Channel were to make a film out of the novel, but they finally decided upon a 26 episode television series instead.[2] Mirella Papaeconomou primarily took on the script's adaptation, and with Hislop's permission added stories and characters that do not exist in the novel to make the series long enough for a full season.[2] Hislop actively participated in the entire process with ideas, suggestions, and observations.
