Sadly, LOL cares not a whit for my favorite show as evidenced by:
Fringe.S05E01.Transilence.Thought.Unifier.Model-11.HDTV.x264.MP3-LOL[AVIGUY].avi
Glitch @ 16:40

Which is not surprising - LOL used his ""bad"" machine last season on Fringe as well:

LOL MP4 Report: Glitch @ 06:24 of ""Fringe.S04E19.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4""
LOL MP4 Report: Glitch @ 20:00 of ""Fringe.S04E20.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4""
LOL MP4 Report: Glitch @ 19:16 of ""Fringe.S04E22.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4""

I'm pretty sure DIMENSION is always the same source as LOL.
MrLss and the unclaimed DivX version are from the same damaged source
Time for a REAL/REPACK/PROPER/INTERNAL ...

So, I'm on the lookout for an undamaged source.
Look for another entry in the near future (hope)"
