This download contains 3 folders of all ms updates for win7 sp1 x64 to about 15-9-12
The folders are numbered in order of install, emulating exactly the order in which windows update presents them and each contains a install.bat for simple 'click n go' so the files are installed in the right order e.g. ie9 gets installed before updates for ie9

The batch files are simply a run command for each file with quiet and norestart switches, though a few at the start of folder 1 will still prompt with uac - can't figure out how to overcome that as yet. Tried a few tricks but all have failed so far.
The last file command in each .bat has the restart switch, so you will be prompted to restart the computer after the last update is installed in each folder

Silverlight can be ignored or installed at any time.
