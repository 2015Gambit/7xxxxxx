Parade`s End 05
...is a triumph
A screenplay by Sir Tom Stoppard, Benedict Cumberbatch as your leading man, the exquisitely gorgeous Rebecca Hall as his bolter wife, a supporting cast of British stars (Rufus Sewell, Miranda Richardson, Roger Allam, Rupert Everett), sex on a train, bored aristocrats, grand old ladies in hats, bone china tea sets: it`s got Sunday night telly written all over it. So why has the BBC scheduled its new adaptation of Ford Madox Ford`s Parade`s End in the Friday night doghouse slot?
