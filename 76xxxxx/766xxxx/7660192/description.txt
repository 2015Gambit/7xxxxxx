Coral has been petitioning to be trained for months, and we finally accepted her. She is eager to learn, masochistic, and her intentions are in the right place. The problem we found out quickly, is that she has low self esteem, and that has to be addressed immediately. We start a sadistic mental breakdown, so that we can build her back the way we want her. She is put through her paces methodically to ensure that we do what is best for her to ensure improvements in her mental ability.
