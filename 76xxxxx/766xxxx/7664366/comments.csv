Original release does not allow save game."
,ngage3650,2012-09-23T14:11Z,"Heads up for anyone who can not save the game. (May apply to this or not).

If you are running Vista/7 this should work for you.

Once you have installed the game (And ticked the create a shortcut on desktop box), every time you launch the game, right click the shortcut and go to ""Run as Administrator"".

If you don't do that, it will come up during the initial loading of the game that the save file has limited access and the game will not be saved or something like that.

Easy! Completed it with Tony Hawk in career mode with no problems."

,HTok,2012-09-24T19:17Z,"IF YOUR SAVE ERASED

YOU CAN FIX IT BY GOING TO:

path_to_gameTony Hawks Pro Skater HDBinariesWin32THPSHDCFile.bin

COPY: CFILE.BIN PASTE IT to your my documents (backup old file first)

Windows 7/Windows Vista
C:UsersUSERNAMEDocumentsMy GamesTony Hawk Pro Skater HDTHHDGameConfigCFile.bin

Windows XP users just check your my documents. Your Path is a bit different.

Start game again and you should have your old progress.

If you didnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t use update yet backup your files before running update just in case."
