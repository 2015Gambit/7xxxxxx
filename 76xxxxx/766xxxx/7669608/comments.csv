[T],jerry7_57,2012-09-26T01:18Z,"You must be new at uploading torrents, you are continuing to post torrents without seeding previous posts. On your season 14 you are giving people hell for not seeding when it is impossible to do when you don't fully upload your torrent. Are the people downloading season 14 supposed to wait while you seed this one or are you going to even finish uploading it at all? I would hate to have to report you for being a faker."
,bc0730,2012-09-26T03:31Z,"You can report whatever you want but I am sure they look into the information to see if it is accurate or not and when they do, they can see on my end, it says all my upload are at 100%!"
[T],jerry7_57,2012-09-26T03:48Z,"Everyone is stuck at 39% on season 14 please finish what you started, I know it was not fully seeded because I started the download when you first posted it. No need to start an argument but alot of people are counting on you to come through for them."
,bc0730,2012-09-26T04:33Z,"No argument here, but you did threaten me.  I am providing this all that is available (highest bandwidth, upload & download strength) and I am seeding it myself 24 hours a day.  I have not shut my computer down in a week since I start getting these files and sharing them.  I see no more I can do better."
,sykoskit,2012-09-26T08:44Z,"hey i fully got season 9,10, and 11 from him, so he's not a faker... but i am still at 6% on this torrent, and i started it 12 hours ago. i'm happy to seed forever, i just need to get the entire file :("
,bc0730,2012-09-26T17:17Z,"@sykoskit, sorry it is taking so long for you to download this, I am guessing it is because at least 25 people are trying to download it all at once and I am the only one that has the whole file because no one has managed to get 100% downloaded yet, I guess that is how it works, it will get there eventually, it is here, please be patient!"
,sykoskit,2012-09-27T02:20Z,"ya i'm sure that's why, that and you're probably still seeding other torrents also, but it's ok. if i could just get the complete file i would seed forever, and it would be my only seed, but it's taking forever lol. i'm at 19.2% 24 hours after start. i guess in a week i'll have it, and i'll seed for everyone else that needs it. thanks for the upload though, i couldn't find this torrent anywhere else"
,bc0730,2012-09-28T02:25Z,"Season 13 should be up later tonight, it may end up being a larger file also unfortunately but soon, I am going to lower my seeding of 9, 10 & 11 until people uploading 12 and the new 13 get through because I have watched probably 100 people upload each of the other seasons and it does not seem they are willing to seed but rather just benefit for themselves so I am going to put most of my bandwidth and upload/download strength focus on 12 and 13 and the minimum amount on the others until people show some respect for others who want this file.  It doesn't take much to seed the files you download for a couple days until the next set of people get it download and do the same and it can just be a continuous cycle instead of making 100s of people rely on my bandwidth connect alone and spend a week downloading a file, this is why they call it file sharing and not file stealing!"
,bc0730,2012-09-28T04:54Z,"Well, unfortunately there has been a malfunction with the uploading of Season 13 which has set me a day or so behind my planned scheduled of getting it uploaded tonight...I started to create the torrent but realized something was missing and removed it but in doing so, it also deleted all the Season 13 episode files, OPPSS!!!  I will get that season up tomorrow if not late tonight/early AM, again, sorry if I got anyone's hopes up!!!"
,sykoskit,2012-09-29T01:23Z,"3 days later and only 49% lol. well i will seed as long as possible, i don't mind... i just appreciate your work, as i couldn't find these seasons anywhere else."
,bc0730,2012-09-29T03:25Z,"This I do not understand...Last night, I downloaded BitTorrent on my wife's computer, came to this site and downloaded this torrent, just like I would any other that I had not posted myself and I changed nothing in my speeds of upload/download from what they have been since I posted and this season uploaded on my wife's computer to 100% within I think 3 or 4 hours, downloading at a steady 2.7MB/s and my computer was uploading at a speed of 3.5MB/s but as soon as hers was finished, my upload speed dropped to under 200Kb/s, again, without me changing anything.  This I do not understand.  What type of internet connection are you using Skit and what is your broadband strength and your settings on your download in your Bit Torrent??"
,bc0730,2012-09-30T00:49Z,"I have now upgraded my internet connection to upload at 5MB/s but still, this has made no change to the strength of upload which is being used to further other uploading my torrents so I have no clue what the issue is.  Please be patient.  Obviously by the fact I just agreed to pay more on my internet bill, I am doing the best I can to get everyone to 100% as quickly as possible.  I think just too many people are uploading at once, I think around 100 on this season alone."
