This time Max and Stacy discuss tuning in, dropping out and the modern day opting out. They also talk about 'high value' customers being fast tracked at Heathrow in the name of expediency; while in the US poor people are fast tracked into a private debt collectors' kickback scheme with the help of district attorneys. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Richard Stallman about Anonymous protests outside virtual doorways, corporate tyrannies and free software.
