Untamed Americas
Outside our concrete jungles, beyond the strip malls and just minutes from our own backyard is another world that is thriving, fighting and surviving. Brawny mountains, burning deserts, tangled forests and curvaceous coasts. A grizzly bear takedown of helpless elk calves in Yellowstone. Big horn sheep going head-to-head in battle. Giant Humboldt squid cannibalizing their kin. Mountain lion cubs hunting solo for the first time. The landscapes and wildlife of the Americas are savage, shrewd and stunning. These are the great outdoors, our wildest frontiers - our Untamed Americas. National Geographic`s four-hour mini-series, Untamed Americas, explores some of the greatest wildlife spectacles and against-the-odds fights for survival in the continents` mountains, deserts, coasts and forests. Narrated by actor Josh Brolin


1)  Coast 
At the frozen poles or the sultry tropics, the coasts of the Americas host some of the greatest spectacles on earth. At the Falkland Islands in the southern end of the Americas, watch male gentoo penguins perform mating jigs to attract females. Farther north, plunge into the Sea of Cortez off the coast of Mexico, where hordes of voracious giant Humboldt squid cannibalize their kin.
