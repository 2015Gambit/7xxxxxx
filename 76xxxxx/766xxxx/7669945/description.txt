    It was once the source of life, light, and warmth. But now the sun has
    turned the entire world into baked and barren wasteland. Forests are
    scorched. Animal carcasses line the roads. Even the nights are dazzling
    bright. Marie, her little sister Leonie and Phillip are heading for the
    mountains in a car with covered windows. Rumor has it there is still
    water there. Along the way they run into Tom, a first-rate mechanic who
    becomes indispensible. But can they trust him? Tension grows in the
    small group. As if things weren't bad enough, they are lured into an
    ambush. Their real battle for survival begins...
