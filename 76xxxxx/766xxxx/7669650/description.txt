NOTE: I do not have constant normal Internet access like all of you.  I steal it from a random neighbor (who turns if off a lot), or I use the free Wifi at the library,   So, this upload may take a couple days or more depending on how much Internet access I have.

Note: Separate English subtitles are included.  If you do not want subtitles, you can simply tap the V key if using VLC Media Player, or you can delete the .srt files.
 
Note: I saw there were no 720p versions of Carnivale on TBP, so I did some searching around on Bitsnoop and found a 720p WEB-DL.  I removed the Russian audio and kept the original English audio, and then I re-encoded the video at a lower bitrate using HandBrake to keep file sizes down (8.09GB vs. 20.5GB).  Finally, I remuxed the new video with the original English audio using mkvmerge.  I will be uploading Season 2 within the next week or so hopefully.

All files are .mkv, ranging from 592MB-838MB, with an average file size of 690MB.

The audio is 6 channel AC-3 @384 kbit.
