Big Time(INDIE FILM)(DVDRip)_TOPSIDER

Danny (Winston Elizalde) and Jonas (Nor Domingo) are two petty crooks who dream of moving into the big scene. When their carefully-planned kidnapping goes askew, 
Danny and Jonas find themselves in a tangle neither of them can handle.

Big Time is the non-linear story of two small-time criminals, a wannabe actress, the son of a crime lord, and the kidnapping that brings all of them together 
for what should be the ticket to their dreams. 

In this crazy world, everybody wants to go big time
