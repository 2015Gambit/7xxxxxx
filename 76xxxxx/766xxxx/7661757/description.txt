Like it's predecessor, "Jahtarian Dubbers Vol. 1", this deadly disc is about to wreck havoc
on terran speakers and walkman personal stereos alike. Filled to the rim with fresh and
hitherto unknown hit tunes the green matter powered Jahtarian warp drive continues to
run in the red area. Our collection of new nerve stunning soundwave modules includes the
whole happy space invading posse: Clause Four, Black Chow, Soom T, Solo Banton, Tapes,
El Fata, Illyah & Ltd. Candy, Ras Amerlock, John Frum, disrupt and the almighty Jahtari
Riddim Force. May cause heavy gravity disorder in your neighbourhood when set on
autopilot.
