,EliteBeast,2012-09-23T08:27Z,Does this one include the prelims that were shown on FX
,Furyfied,2012-09-23T08:44Z,"@EliteBeast - Judging from the size, it might have included the prelims because I searched in Kickass Torents earlier and it shows a UFC 152 Preliminary Fights torrent with a size of only 1.1 GiB. So most probably this includes both the Preliminary and Main Card already.

@Everybody Else - And yeah, please seed. Thank you. :)"
,extracube,2012-09-23T08:46Z,"This might be the whole event as time says 2hrs48 mins?

Still, anyone have a smaller size?"
,Glowtrain,2012-09-23T09:03Z,"Since Jones pussied out and would not fight Sonnen there was no 151 so been going through UFC withdrawals. 

Thanks for putting this up, greatly appreciated. "
,Rush,2012-09-23T10:00Z,"outstanding quality, A/V
no prelims, full ppv card only

Thanx, Dibya"
,Furyfied,2012-09-23T10:02Z,"Wow, I started downloading this one for about 220 kbps and now it went down to a whooping 1.5 kbps. -_- More seeds would be greatly appreciated."
,extracube,2012-09-23T10:32Z,"@Fury, same here.  It says I have 19hrs remaining.

@ Rush, what do you mean by ""no prelims?"" are you saying this is ONLY the Jones/Belfort fight?  Didn't quite understand you.  Please clarify, somebody."

,eddiesadvocate,2012-09-23T20:21Z,Great upload and fast! Thank you!
,extracube,2012-09-24T06:27Z,"Looks decent, not super sharp, but not ""patchy"" either.  it is very watchable.

V 8.5, A same

I also have to say ""WTF"" guys?  The numbers on this torrent dropped way down.  Several hours ago it was 5,000+ seeders and 7,000+ leechers.  Now it's 3000+/1000+.  Always leave your computer on and seed for at least an extra day (or two)."
