,ben7530,2012-09-23T16:48Z,"Does the included crack work on Win8?

Most of the others did not..."
,sati777,2012-09-23T17:43Z,"thx i hope this fix the ""do not harm"" quest bug"
,unscarred786,2012-09-23T18:55Z,"Works perfect, I don't know what that other cock goblin is talking about.."
,Sivos,2012-09-23T19:15Z,"@unscarred786 
If you read the description, the line under SKIDROW, you'll see what he meant.

@phunqe
You do realize they copy and paste those descriptions, right?  You don't honestly think they always sit there and type everything out the exact way every time.  He probably forgot to change the update title, notice how the info itself is changed except that.  Grow up and stop getting pissy over the dumbest shit, it makes you look more like dumbass than you already are."
,dJape994,2012-09-23T19:34Z,"This update didn't fix the ""Do no harm"" quest :((("

I realize that. I was just being an ass. ;-)"
,BlackComb,2012-09-23T20:46Z,This does not work on Windows 8 64x
,sati777,2012-09-23T20:50Z,"@djape yea still bugged, its the fault of the developers"
,ben7530,2012-09-23T22:10Z,"@BlackComb

Thanks dude!

We need a Win8 update/crack!"
,topk,2012-09-23T22:55Z,"How come this one is 37MB and the other ones are 18MB? 
The release log file is 18 MB - not 37MB 
Why?"
,Furious1964,2012-09-24T00:38Z,This is supposed to be the latest build (35.4705) but the newest trainer for that build crashes the game. So is this the real deal? I already tried the other one and same thing.
,Furious1964,2012-09-24T00:41Z,Forgot to mention that it's for the build released 9/20/2012.

is this real and they just used wrong nfo or is this fake and the nfo is real?"
,fibroptk,2012-09-24T19:01Z,"Lol its funny how you guys think that its just gonna magically work on Win8 x64... Your not gonna get much support on that situation...

Win7 x64 and x32 this works perfectly on, Vista x64 and 32 is fine. no virus clean install quit your bitching and seed like a your suppose to. "
,kcfunnthesun,2012-09-25T08:25Z,sory man. but this not work. please help as.
,r46u50r1n,2012-09-25T09:42Z,works thx win 7 x64
,Marikhen,2012-09-26T01:28Z,"Actually it doesn't work for Windows 7 x64, not for some people at least.  The Borderlands2.exe file loads up for all of one second at most and then shuts down on my machine."
,Mr.Syche,2012-09-26T01:33Z,"To everyone who can't get it to start properly, Make sure you have Steam installed. It doesn't need to be running in order to start the game, Just install it!"
,jlc4life,2012-09-26T01:50Z,"If I have installed the Crack from 3DM, 
D
o I just copy/paste in binaries/win32 and use the B2launcher ?"
,PARA_D0X,2012-09-26T05:09Z,"Windows 8 Fix. I can confirm this works, also if you are playing this with friends you will need them to use this patch as well or you'll get an error. Works on Windows 7 as well.

,novice90k,2012-09-26T06:47Z,Could you upload the 1.0.2 Patch - it came out Sept 25th.
,zDisturbed1,2012-09-26T08:23Z,"@PARA_D0X
Uh no, that is completely wrong. This torrent is for the update if you install the 1.0 crack over the top of the update you lose the update and reverting to stock. So what you are telling people to do is no diffrent than telling them to completely unuinstall and reinstall it will in no way make the update work on windows 8."
,Marikhen,2012-09-26T12:32Z,"A crack to bypass Steam that requires Steam be installed isn't really much of a crack, especially not for people like me who use them primarily to avoid having Steam on their PC in the first place."
