Γÿ╛"Beautiful to watch, and supports a great site." - Kolunya

This app shows you the current phase of the Moon, using a simulation of the lunar surface created by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance mission during its observations of the Moon.

Γÿ╛"It does exactly what it says and helps support an awesome site." - Erik

The image accurately represents not only the current phase of the Moon, but also the distance to the Moon - updating in real-time. The Moon appears larger when it's closer, and smaller when it's more distant.

You can smoothly drag the Moon phase back and forth with your finger, or even "spin it" to quickly advance forwards or backwards. It's kind of hypnotic.

Γÿ╜ Beautiful images of the Moon were made by NASA from data collected by spacecraft.

Γÿ╜ See the current date, distance, phase name and illumination percentage.

Γÿ╜ Swipe left and right to move forward or backwards in time to see what the Moon will look like in the future or past. It slides back and forth with "buttery" smoothness. Spin it faster or slower.

Γÿ╜ Need to find the next full Moon? You can click a button to take you to the next full Moon or new Moon.

Γÿ╜ You can also access a calendar that shows you the phase of the Moon for any date in the future.

Γÿ╜ Share your phase of the Moon images on all the popular social networks

Γÿ╜ Put a phase of the Moon widget right on your desktop
