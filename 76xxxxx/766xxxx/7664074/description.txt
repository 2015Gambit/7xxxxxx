The story of Russell Watson is inspirational: a factory worker born in Salford, North West England, Russell went from performing on the pub and club circuit in his spare time to singing for the Pope, prime ministers and presidents and selling over 5 million albums worldwide. Watson, otherwise known as "The Voice," is back with all his most popular hits on one CD. The Ultimate Collection features "Nessun Dorma," "Funiculi, Funicula" "Miserere," and "Nella Fantasia." The new collection also contains two new bonus tracks, Elvis's #1 hit "Can't Help Falling In Love" and Whitney Houston's powerful song "I Have Nothing."
