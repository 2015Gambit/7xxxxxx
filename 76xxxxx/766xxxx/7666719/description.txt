This is a lossless rip of the 2008 bonus track laden CD version of the 1970s LP by British pop act "Brotherhood of Man", which contains the megahit "United We Stand".

I remember seeing someone requesting a lossless rip of this on another site, so this is on me and it's for you, whoever you are.

The 70 minutes of music on this most definitely represents the early 1970s anti-Vietnam, hippie scene sentiment that was pretty big at the time (though this release and group being a bit on the manufactured music act side), so it's most definitely a curiosity in modern times.

For those who were there when the classic tune "United We Stand" first hit the airwaves, those who long for a high def audio version of said tune or just wants a slice of early 70s protest pop, this little ditty is for you.
