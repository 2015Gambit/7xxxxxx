Away from the World is the eighth studio album by Dave Matthews Band (DMB), released on September 11, 2012. Steve Lillywhite produced Away from the World, which marks his first released studio album with the band since 1998's Before These Crowded Streets. A series of failed sessions with Lillywhite led to the leaked Lillywhite Sessions in 2000 and Lillywhite's departure from the band's work.

DMB and Lillywhite recorded the album in a Seattle studio beginning in early January 2012,[7] and production on the album finished in May.[8] In addition to the 11 songs that made the album, one other song was attempted during the sessions, but the band did not complete that song.[9] Violinist Boyd Tinsley said of the process: "Some of the songs that you hear on this album, the basic tracks came out, like, the first or second time we played them. Dave would come in with part of a song. WeΓÇÖd get into the control room and weΓÇÖd finish it, putting in a chorus or bridge here and working out arrangements. And then we went to the studio, and we just played.
