mp3DirectCut is a small tool for editing MP3 files directly, without any quality loss to the original file. You can remove parts, change the volume, split files or copy regions to several new files. All without the need to decompress your MP3 into a PCM format. This saves work, encoding time and disk space. And there is no quality loss through any re-compressions! 

Trim your CD grabbings or directly to MP3 recorded vinyls or tapes. Cut favourit songs from long MP3 radio or live recordings. Make multiple cuts and fades. mp3DirectCut is very fast and gives you extensive control over your MP3s.
