Narrowly avoiding jail, new dad Robbie
vows to turn over a new leaf. A visit
to a whisky distillery inspires him
and his mates to seek a way out of their
hopeless lives.

This bitter sweet comedy follows protagonist Robbie
as he sneaks into the maternity hospital to visit
his young girlfriend Leonie and hold his newborn son
Luke for the first time. Overwhelmed by the moment,
he swears that Luke will not have the same tragic
life he has had. Escaping a prison sentence by the
skin of his teeth, he's given one last chance.....
While serving a community service order, he meets
Rhino, Albert and Mo who, like him, find it impossible
to find work because of their criminal records. Little
did Robbie imagine how turning to drink might change
their lives - not cheap fortified wine, but the best
malt whiskies in the world. Will it be 'slopping out'
for the next twenty years, or a new future with
'Uisge Beatha' the 'Water of Life?' Only the angels know...
