For such a concise discography, the history of one of EDMΓÇÖs greatest cult duos has been writ plenty large. 'Summer Calling'. 'Beautiful Things'. Two tracks, two successive years, two conclusive anthems and ones that masterminded the rocking of countless club floors. That was followed by a recorded-but-never-released long-player, band hiatus, a parting of ways and finally, in 2011, the reunion. All of which has led to this point: the release of Andain's first official album.
