This is the re-post of the seventh episode from my previous torrent which contained 

the entire season 1. There seems to be a problem with this file in that torrent 

hence has been posted separately. It has been re-encoded to avoid further problems. 

This is the link for the complete season 1 in bluray 480p:

Crawley family and their servants.

accepts moving onto the vast estate with his even more modernist, socially engaged 

mother, who clashes with his lordship's domineering, conservative ma the dowager.
