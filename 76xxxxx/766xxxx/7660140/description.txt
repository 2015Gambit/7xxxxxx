The SOS Band is an American musical ensemble, founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1977. Originally known as Santa Monica, the 'SOS' initialism in the band's name stands for Sounds of Success.

The band, fronted by Mary Davis, was initially famous for the hit "Take Your Time (Do It Right)" in 1980. In 1983, they joined forces with then new production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who went on to craft a string of R&B hits for the group, including "Just Be Good to Me", "Tell Me If You Still Care", "Borrowed Love", "No One's Gonna Love You", "Just the Way You Like It" and "The Finest".
