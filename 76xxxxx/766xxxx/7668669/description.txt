Even after hearing reports of the Japanese militaryΓÇÖs surrender, Oba dismisses the reports as propaganda and continues to launch guerilla attacks against the American soldiers, earning him the nickname ΓÇ£The FoxΓÇ¥. Soon, even the American commander whoΓÇÖs charged with the task of capturing Oba comes to admire his persistent enemy.
