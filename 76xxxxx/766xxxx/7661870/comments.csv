,ectogwarb,2012-09-23T01:31Z,"Awesome, thanks seeders! :)"
,uberhito,2012-09-23T08:36Z,"This is the full movie and all bonus scenes from the deluxe edition DVD. If you only want the film, it is the largest file in the torrent, but I recommend getting the entire torrent because the individual interviews contain detailed and varied perspectives on the singularity by people in different fields that concern the issue. I shared this because I believe the information contained about the potential future we all face is something that as many people should know about as possible, but please support the creators if it is within your means and purchase the film."

I am almost stuck at 15 percent. Please help and seed more. My ratio is almost 2.0 and I will continue to seed after the download is complete."

For those that didnt know, this was made in 2009 and only released onto dvd recently. However there will soon be an updated movie released soon called ""Singularity the film"" if anyone is interested. The webite is: http://thesingularityfilm.com/"
