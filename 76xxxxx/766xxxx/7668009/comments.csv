If you watch this have google at the ready and just do some fact checking while you watch and you'll have to laugh. Example- ""Obama sympathizes with terrorists."" (Actually claimed in the movie)

,prioremincantatem,2012-09-24T14:35Z,"I completely agree, it's a disingenuous, blatantly untrue piece of propaganda â&#x20AC;&#x201C; but I'm going to watch it out of interest of what passes for capital-R Republican mainstream these days."
,lectruck,2012-09-24T14:58Z,"Great Movie, explains Obama, and the Truth never hurt anyone, as badly as Obama is and will hurt America!"
,ahoi1,2012-09-24T15:47Z,Propaganda at its best :)
,freeis4me,2012-09-24T16:24Z,The truth is often called propaganda by the people that don't want to hear it.
,ahoi1,2012-09-24T16:27Z,"Haha so this moronic fella talks about how Obama returned churchill's bust back to england.

Truth is, the bust was moved from oval office to some other room in the white house, ""outside the treaty room"".

I think I can save myself the time to check the facts. I expect nothing else than even more blatant lies in the movie :)

Goddamit are fox minions stupid. They are more irrational than islamic extremists :)"

,skivijimmy,2012-09-24T18:16Z,How can this be propaganda??? Obama narrates over 75% of the movie using his audio book. Also all the info comes from Obama's book and speeches.. Nothing here is propaganda or made up. If it makes Obama look bad it's because Obama's own words make himself look bad
,goldlite,2012-09-24T18:16Z,"I haven't watched the movie yet but I did read the book & I look forward to seeing this.  BTW, Obama DID return the Churchill bust to England-check your facts before you mouth off.  Including the facts about Obama and the Muslims.  Oh, ahoi1, I agree with you.... you should definitely save yourself the time and not bother to check facts.  Facts would be wasted on you. "
,skivijimmy,2012-09-24T18:20Z,"Obama wrote and said himself that he sympathizes with the terrorists. Nobody is trying to make Obama look bad. Only Obama can make himself look bad by what he has written and said.. You all just need to read and listen to Obama and not cover you ears, eyes and mouths"

,LindsayLohanite,2012-09-24T22:46Z,"one of the things that's brought out from Obama's own book and in Obama's own words, is the influence his own mother had on him. Ann Dunham (later Ann Obama,Ann Soetoro).  Obama tells how his mother and Lolo Soetoro would be arguing and he heard his mother screaming 'they are not my people!' meaning the American businessman that Lolo had begun doing business with. Ann was very much anti-american herself and had a great influence on the viewpoint of her son. "
,LindsayLohanite,2012-09-24T22:49Z,"sorry if the truth upsets some people here. I know to some Obama lovers, truth and information can be like kryptonite to Superman."
,wtfname,2012-09-24T23:08Z,"Funny how using direct quotes & old video of the person saying the things he said is Propaganda.  Strange how the ignorant stay ignorant or is it.

As always Thanks Scenebalance for all your hard work no matter the side your on!!  You are greatly appreciated my many thousands! "

,emnioj71,2012-09-25T02:21Z,"Kool-aid for the weak-minded.  Taking old statements out of context and misrepresenting supposition as fact.   

  There is a reason the uneducated and less than bright tend to be Republicans.

 But hey, the tea party is putting the fashionable back in fascism, so good for you."
,...TPB...,2012-09-25T02:26Z,"I bet that most (if not all) of the people leaving negative comment shaven't even watched the video. They love Obama and no matter what he does, they'll keep loving him. He can do no wrong in their eyes, partly because it means they would have to admit they made a mistake by loving him so much before he had done anything. Notice the hate spewing from the left, just on this one torrent? I wish I knew why they are so full of hatred and anger."

,NoMoreAVI,2012-09-25T03:37Z,"Funny how lefties cry propaganda, when lefties have been pumping it out for decades. Mikey Moore is far worse. 

2016 is the 5th ranking documentary at boxofficemojo.com. Watch for Occupy Unleashed tomorrow."
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T06:18Z,"Great movie from the author of a great book - The Roots Of Obama's Rage.

Democrats need to move to France (or any such country of much less Economic Freedom than the USA).  Seriously - what the hell are you doing in a country founded precisely to get away from people like yourselves?!  Fuck off!  Get your thieving hands out of our pockets and go play socialism somewhere else!"
,epiconedude,2012-09-25T06:55Z,"excellent documentary.  torrent is the real deal.  everyone should watch this, whether you like obama or not.  very educational and informative"
,jojojojjo,2012-09-25T07:08Z,"Idiots who claim this movie a piece of propaganda are worst than ostrich sticking head in the sand. This Kenyan punk is turning America into third world country. You idiot need to wake up and act before you look like Kenyan and Pakistani running  behind a piece of bread like Egyptians  by 2016...........

If you can comprehend! This whole movie is based on the facts spoken by Obama family and friend in Kenya.
Wake up!!"

,wtfname,2012-09-26T00:47Z,"After watching this Documentary I looked for the propaganda listed in this comment section.  1) I found none & what was given in this film was backed by paperwork, video archives, first hand interviews & of course the Presidents own words before he became Senator, while he was a Senator & after he became President.  Nothing taken out of context nothing clipped & edited.  His own brother in Kenya had insightful things to say.

Again Thanks Scenebalance

Truly you sound like people who would adore obie.....  kinda that 6 year old tantrum thing.  Almost as mature as obie is.  Please, enjoy the next 4 years.  And as he will say when put back into office... ""Ya think the last 4 years were bad, WATCH THIS!! giggle, giggle)""  I am sooo very sorry for America!"

In response to this.... Google gives you responses based on your other searches. If you are an Obama fan and choose to search about him on Google's search engine, you will most likely receive great feedback instead of the negative feedback and facts I receive from my search since I am not an Obama supporter. 

Obama will destroy us, more than he already has . "
