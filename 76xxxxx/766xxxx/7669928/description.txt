After the Storm

After four seasons of "will they" or "won't
they," Richard Castle and Kate Beckett
finally gave in to their feelings for each
other in the much anticipated Season 4
finale. Season 5 picks up on the proverbial
morning after, with Castle and Beckett
facing new questions -- Was this a one-time
fling, or are they now a couple? But before
they find the answers, they must take on
the forces responsible for Beckett's
mother's murder that now threaten Kate
Beckett's life.
