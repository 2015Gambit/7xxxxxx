2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

In all likelihood, this will probably be my final 2012 bundle of the year.  Back in Bundle #38, I raised the question if I should continue or not.  Surprisingly, one person responded.  So I think I'll torrent this 41st bundle today, then wait until 2013 to decide if I want to do this all over again for a third year in a row.

Let's do a little math.  Up to my 40th bundle, I had shared 1042 releases on the year.  Then rzrshiv kindly pointed out that I needed to subtract five for duplication.  And now today's 41st bundle contains 30 more titles.  So that's 1042 - 5 + 30 = 1067 releases for 2012!

Hopefully this 41st bundle has something for everyone.  If you like hip-hop, then you're covered with Christon Gray or even Erica Cumbo's much anticipated "Beauty For Ashes" album.  If Christian Blues is your preference, then how about Lurrie Bell, John Pearson, or even Joe Louis Walker?  Looking for some Gospel today?  I've got that covered too with Leandria Johnson's "The Experience" album.  Southern Gospel?  The Oak Ridge Boys.  R&B?  Ruth Noemi.  Or maybe you're looking for some Bluegrass?  Look no further than "The Rough Guide To Bluegrass" by Various Artists.  Christian Rock?  There's plenty of it here.  Some that come to mind is Needtobreathe's new EP, Abel, Kronicles, etc.  Some metal perhaps?  Tsavo Inc should take care of that.  Contemporary?  Mark Schultz!  Worship?  Jadon Lavik, Mike Kim, and Wordology.
