,smisahs,2012-09-23T21:31Z,Thank you so much for sharing your time with us! To God Be The Glory!!!!!!!
,blindark,2012-09-24T07:08Z,"thx for what you do TT, 
your work will surely be missed! :/
I for one would love to see you continue
on doing what you do, 
what you do has helped me (and im sure many others) to discover so many new christian artists and they have helped me make it through many days. Thx you and Bless you."
,Thighmstr,2012-09-24T07:43Z,TT:  I created a login just to let you know how valuable these torrents have been.  Your torrents have been by far the best I have seen.  I check everyday just to see what you have uploaded and what new music I will discover.  You have broadened my understanding of the christian music realm and have given me new artists to support.  I hope that you will continue even if that is in a more limited capacity.  Thank you!!
,adexxy123,2012-09-24T17:15Z,"TT, if you choose to stop now no one can complain. You have been a blessing to me like nothing else. You have refreshed my Gospel collection and for that i am truly grateful. I hope you continue as I am sure several folks are blessed by directly downloading from your site or sharing with people who have downloaded. Stay blessed."

,PaleoPirate,2012-09-25T04:11Z,"Gotta agree with everyone else. There aren't words for how much I appreciate your hard work, and if you want to stop, I totally get it, but I really hope you don't."
,TedDekker,2012-09-25T22:37Z,"Torrentracts! You know I love you! My laptop crashed so I lost a lot of your recent stuff but I was able to get most of it except the few dead torrents which is only like 11! I had all the rest of the stuff backed up on a hard drive. 

What is this about you leaving for the rest of the year! No! LOL! I completely understand. Do what you feel man, if you need to take a break I completely understand! I will always be your biggest fan! If u keep posting for the rest of the year I'll be here downloading them if you decide to wait till next year Will be waiting for you then! Whatever you want to do I support!

Would be nice to always keep getting new material but whatever works for you is okay with me!

You are a God send and a true angel! 

Best,
Ted Dekker"

,syncnd,2012-09-29T07:31Z,"TorrentTracts, I wanna say I'm really, really grateful for everything you've been doing here. You're blessed!

And then, just when I discover your work, you say you're gonna stop with the bundles...I know it does take you a lot of work, anyway. But we love them! Please, if you stop the bundles, would you still keep at it with albums/discographies? Thanks!

Please, is there any other way to contact you apart from this site...like, a group on Facebook?

Peace."
,syncnd,2012-09-29T07:36Z,"Yeah, but as tommycool88 said, if you need a break, then it's cool.
