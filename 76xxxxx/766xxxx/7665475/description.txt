And here you go, another treat, the first book in the XIII series by Jean Van Hamme and William Vance.
Some of the series have been released in english before, Catalan Communications got 3 issues out in 1989, Alias Comics got 5 issues out in 2005, and Marvel managed to get the first 3 albums out.
There have also been a scanlation of book 1-20 out, but I focus on the scans of the Cinebook version.

But now Cinebook have taken up the challenge, and have so far released the first 14 books, so now you can get an official version too :)


A man washes ashore near an old couples house, barely alive. When he comes to, he has forgotten everything, including his name. The only clues to his identity: a key sewn into his clothes, a bullet wound to the headΓÇª and the number XIII tattooed on his shoulder. A meagre start to reconstruct ones self.
