A Short Guide to Fast Language Learning

How long does it take to learn another language? How many words do we need to learn? Are languages within the reach of everybody? Which teachers should we avoid?

These are some of the questions you ask yourself when you or your children start to learn a new language. The Word Brain, by BSK, provides the answers. PDFs and MP3s (audio books) are free. New content will be available soon.
