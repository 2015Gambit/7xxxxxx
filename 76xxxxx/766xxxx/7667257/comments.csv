Still, thanks JoeKKer for yet another great game ripped!"
,KillByLove,2012-10-01T05:52Z,"The only error I have found is there is no voices during pre-rendered cut-scenes, but if you have subtitles on it shouldn't be a problem. Works completely fine otherwise."
,JoeKKer,2012-10-01T07:57Z,WHAT ?????
,KillByLove,2012-10-01T10:39Z,"It's because of how they do the cut-scenes (if my memory of Borderlands 1 before I uninstalled it is correct).

They put the voices separate to the actual .bik files so it's less hassle with languages (I assume). I'm guessing those files are just missing."
,JoeKKer,2012-10-04T08:00Z,Dude No Files Are Missing !!! I Can Assure U That
