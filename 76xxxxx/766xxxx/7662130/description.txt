Stephen Hawking's: Grand Design
In this remarkable new series 'Stephen Hawking's Grand Design' the world's most famous physicist attempts to unravel the truths behind humanity's most enduring questions: Did God Create the universe? What is the meaning of life? Why does the universe exist? Unfolding his personal, compelling vision of the universe, the eminent British cosmologist evaluates a variety of intricate ideas, from 'Intelligent Design' to the impact the search for the Higgs Boson particle at CERN could have on our understanding of the cosmos. Drawing on more than 40 years of his own research and a recent series of observations and theoretical breakthroughs, Hawking presents his original and controversial theories, applying current scientific understanding to these complex concepts. Combining cutting edge visuals with this witty and incisive world view discover how physics and cosmology are being used to tackle ideas that philosophers have struggled with for thousands of years



3)  Did God Create the Universe 
Professor Stephen Hawking unfolds his personal, compelling vision of the biggest question of all: Is there a god who created and controls the universe in which we live? To answer this controversial and age old question, Hawking takes us on a journey through humanity's history of appraising our place in the Universe - from Vikings facing down eclipses to the laws of modern cosmology. Using the laws of physics, Hawking argues that the universe can pop into being from absolutely nothing, that there was no time before the creation of the universe and therefore, no room for a Grand Designer.
