Writing library                          : |HCenc 0.21.0.0 - (c) 2004/2007|

So these are transcoded from original mpeg2 using HC Encoder.  The rip is PAL but the accompanying covers are USA origin so I expect the ripper has  transcoded in order to deinterlace, convert to PAL 25fps and maybe to convert DVD9 to 2x DVD5 (I've watched the US NTSC discs and it is interlaced/telecined)."
