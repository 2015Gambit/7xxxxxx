love,love,love, your series of booker prize winners etc. The NY times uoload with a bonus fiction series was phenominal. Don't stop the music.
I read to my granddaughter twice a week. She is just seven but can read like a 11 year old. Do you have any reccomendations. I do not care for most of the Newberry prize winners. They are what adults would like to think kids should read. They have forgotten what it is like to be 5 or 10 years old. It should have an edge, and flights of imagination and adventure. Not a nice packaged metaphor full of the thoughts we think  our children should have. Sorry that's not how it works. If you have any help fire away. Thanks again for everything."

Can't think of any :(
Maybe someone else reading this can suggest something."
