,fakeidmuhammad,2012-09-25T19:21Z,Does it have subtitles? We non-Glaswegians would like to enjoy this movie too.
,realpeoplepirate,2012-09-26T15:54Z,"THANX BOZX, u guy(s?) rawk, been w8n on a decent copy of  this movie, I'v met a few of th cast, and I knew u'd come thru :D
A/V 10 (never given lightly but I found it perfect)
M 10 A really feel good movie, if u know of Ken Loaches work u'll love this, lots of realistic emotional drama with a dark sense of humour running throughout. If u like this check out My Name Is Joe  from Peter Mullen also, its got same Glasweegian/scots ""dour"" humour ;)
Oh and Dexter Fletcher who has bit part in this has also been doin great things in British cinema this year with Wild Bill , film he Directed and co-wrote, which is also brilliant imho ;)"
,realpeoplepirate,2012-09-26T16:05Z,"Just realised I was thinking of the movie Orphans not My Name Is Joe, D'oh!  Orphans is a very funny Glasweegian movie which was written and Directed by Peter Mullan ;)
My Name Is Joe was also from Ken Loach tho and is amazing..... Damn, kush got me fukkin up lol :P"
