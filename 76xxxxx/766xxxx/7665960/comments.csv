THANK YOU VERY LITTLE FOR NO SUBS!!!"
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-09-28T04:38Z,"I found subs on the Web, but apparently only the Russian language is translated, not the German.  That's okay though, because the movie explains pretty much everything.  The German text that describes locations and dates however, does not get translated by the subs.

A very good film, those problems aside."
