5 Military Models for Element 3D.

Included are:

AH-64D Longbow
F-14 Tomcat
AH-6 Little Bird
Sea Knight
Tiger Helicopter


I did not make these or skin these. I simply imported them into Element 3D, applied all the diffuse, specular and bump maps, and saved them. Figured this would save people some time. I got sick of having to remap all my models every time I downloaded a new one.


Thanks,
