,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:13Z,You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files! More formats would be great! Especially the old proper xvid releases!

I mean Not to sound ungrateful to the people uploading all these, but I am the only one in my family that uses computers, so I have to burn it to disc for everyone. And waiting an hour to convert a file that hardly ever works and loses Quality is a waste of time, when they then put up an avi file HOURS after this x264 shit, that downloads in under 20 mins. "
,NoMoreAVI,2012-09-23T03:53Z,"ButtHead, it must suck to have to burn AVIs to CD so you can play them on DVD-TV. Upgrade to a Pentium 4 and Win7 and join the mpeg-4 revolution."
,NoMoreAVI,2012-09-23T03:58Z,"You could also get  a tablet, media player, TV, or blu-ray player with MKV support. Stop living in the past."
,NowDeathlyswindler,2012-09-23T05:11Z,"@BUTT_SEX I finally got around to making an account specifically to tell you to shut up. I have seen you wine and complain about what file type people upload their files in. The only negative thing you should say about a torrent is in regards to quality of the file and this users content is fine. Either get off your lazy A$S and find the torrent you want or shut the fck up.

Great torrent Thanks for uploading! "
