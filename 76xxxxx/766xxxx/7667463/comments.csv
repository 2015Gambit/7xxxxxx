I'm gonna be clear from the start about this release. (similar to the previous AnyDVD release)
This release is working, now that this is cleared.. The crack itself is a file marked as ""Protected System File"" thanks to SlySoft. therefor you need Administrative permission to copy the crack.
Most of you will be able to make the release work just like before.. congrats ;)
whoever faces difficulties in finding out my he/she is not able to make it work please post here and I'll help you.
Now whoever wants to throw bullshit comments here go fetch somewhere else and don't waste our time :)"
,Bloksee,2012-09-25T04:29Z,Thank you ChattChitto.
,bigjohnman,2012-09-25T08:56Z,"ChattChitto,
Much honor and respect. I have been using your torrents for years. You always release high quality stuff. Are you reverse engineering the software using a decompiler?
I released about 100 or so dvd's on TPB using your versions of AnyDVD. I am working on releasing several Blu-rays, but getting them from 50 Gb, to 25 Gb with the highest video rendering possible takes about a week per disc. 
Thank you for all that you have done for the community, and please keep up the good work."
,webspyder,2012-09-25T17:20Z,"I agree fully with 'Bigjohnman'! 
I'm very impressed and furthermore very thankfull for all of your work and your uploads here! BIG thanks!
Hats of to you ChattChitto!!  :)"
,Michaelp800,2012-09-28T18:37Z,"Doesn't work!

If you look the details for the encryped data, tehre is a line called

***""Error during processing of the disc.
AnyDVD is disabled""***

And it really works NOT!"
,noob23,2012-09-30T18:45Z,"ChattChitto, you should be a legend man. Even for a noob like me this shit was super easy and works  like a charm."
,Gargrevar001,2012-09-30T22:17Z,"Thanks again ChattChitto, It worked a treat but not in the same way as I was expecting...

After the restart and closing down AnyDVD I reactivated your little App and opened the crack but it was not hidden despite my having system and hidden files not showing. I also simply dragged and dropped the dll into the install folder and did not have to replace anything.

Did I do something wrong?

The prog seems to be working, restarted a couple of times now and it seems to be stable and legit..


Thanks again for a superb and trustworthy release."
,TheLathe,2012-10-04T00:19Z,"Hello ChattMan!  Sure have appreciated your program and efforts for MANY months now.

However, I AM getting this new error message where after scanning the Blu-ray and removing all the protections it says, 'ERROR - ANYDVD turned off'  I looked on the Slysoft forums and they say that this shows a pirated / cracked version and it KNOWS somehow and shuts it off.

Could you PLEASE help?

Thank you!!!

Lathe."
