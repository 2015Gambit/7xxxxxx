INFO          : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Avery 

I have been a big fan of the work of animation director Tex Avery for many years: I had all the VHS tapes & the Droopy DVDs. Tex Avery was one of the greatest animated cartoon directors of all time, further info on him & his MGM work can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Avery
A year or so ago there was a post of his MGM cartoons here on this site, but the quality was not great, taken from TV rips perhaps? This is a STAFF APPROVED upgrade. :-) TNT have never released the MGM cartoons on DVD let alone Blu-ray, and maybe never will. Recently I was lucky enough to find the French DVD release of the MGM cartoon collection on DVD (not all remastered, but you take what you can get). This is a 5 DVD set, but the 5th disk is 2 documentaries in French (with english subtitles), so I will not post it here unless asked.
included here: Uncle Tom's Cabana 1947 & Half-Pint Pygmy 1948.
