,nursemorph,2012-09-22T15:33Z,"Thanks for the upload...I don't download the Practices but appreciate all the uploading you do.

Incidentally, does anyone know if there was an Inside GP programme this week? No-one (as far as I can tell) has upped it and I can't find it anywhere on the web"
,nursemorph,2012-09-23T17:17Z,Never mind. Found the Inside GP programme on YouTube. Still confused by why it's not anywhere else?
