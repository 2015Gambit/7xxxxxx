,gianelli76,2012-09-23T06:46Z,"Ok, 1st this is not a complaint and I certainly appreciate the time and trouble you invest to provide these downloads.  I'm just trying to understand what's happening because it's happened to me a couple of times recently.

I use Foxit instead of Adobe - long story.  This file will also not open in Calibre or on a Kindle 3.  I finally got it to open using Chrome but even saving it as a different file after opening with Chrome doesn't fix the problems with Foxit and Kindle. 

The solution seems to be deleting the NAME of the file and typing in another.  Foxit was indicating that the 1st two ""e""s in N?w Sci?ntist had been replaced with question marks as shown even though file manager showed no change. Typing in a new file name seems to fix the problem.

Anybody know what's happening?  Even though I've got a fix, I'd still like to know WHY it happened."
