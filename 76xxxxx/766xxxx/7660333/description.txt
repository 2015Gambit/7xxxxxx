Doom Ultimate + Doom 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doom (or DOOM) is a 1993 computer game by id Software that is a landmark title 
in the first-person shooter genre, and in first person gaming in general. It is 
widely recognized for pioneering immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer 
gaming on the PC platform, and support for custom expansions (WADs). Distributed 
as shareware, Doom was downloaded by an estimated 10 million people within two 
years, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture; as a 
sign of its effect on the industry, games from the mid-1990s boom of 
first-person shooters are often known simply as "Doom clones". Its graphic and 
interactive violence has also made Doom the subject of much controversy reaching 
outside the gaming world. According to GameSpy, Doom was voted by industry 
insiders to be the greatest game of all time in 2004.
