The Game is a 1997 psychological thriller film directed by David Fincher, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, and produced by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It tells the story of an investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.
The Game was well received by critics like Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, though Leonard Maltin found the film "unusually mean-spirited" and lacking a sense of humor.[1] The Game had middling box-office returns compared to the success of Fincher's previous film, Seven. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life sized clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.
