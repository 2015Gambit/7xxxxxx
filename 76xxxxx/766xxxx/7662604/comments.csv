,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:15Z,You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files! More formats would be great! Especially the old proper xvid releases!
