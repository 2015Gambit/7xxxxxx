This theme is works well with Apex, Nova, ADW, and Go Launchers. It may work with other varying launchers found on the market but has not been tested for compatibility.

    Designed for XHDPI devices. Resolution may vary depending on your device.
    Icons will continuously be added as time progresses. We will try to honor all icon request as they come in. However, it may not be possible to get all finished at one time so they will be added as the app is updated.
