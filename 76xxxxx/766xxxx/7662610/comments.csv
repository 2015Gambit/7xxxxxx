If you are using utorrent, firstly make sure that you have configured the folders in utorrent correcly.

After creating the torrent file, place the files to be seeded in the folder for 'incomplete downloads'.

Put the torrent file in the folder for the 'torrents in progress'

Then click on the torrent file to add it to utorrent, utorrent will locate the file in the 'inconplete downloads', and move then into the 'completed donloads'

utorrent will then seed the file.
