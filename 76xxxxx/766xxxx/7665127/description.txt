
People. I see torrents here with video of French in Action, but nobody offers audio of this course and pdfs. This course was meant as video and audio course.

French In Action: a video instructional series in French for college and high school classrooms and adult learners; 52 half-hour video programs.  http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html

This series uses active participation to increase fluency in French, while introducing French culture. Pierre Capretz?s proven language-immersion method is presented within a humorous teleplay with native speakers of all ages and backgrounds. The storyline of an American student and a young Frenchwoman's adventures in Paris and the French countryside is reinforced by Dr. Capretz?s on-camera instruction. The series is also appropriate for teacher professional development.

Produced by Yale University and WGBH Boston with Wellesley College. 1987.
