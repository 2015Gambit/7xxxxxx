Doesn't seem to actually be the ""Ultra"" version, or it's not enabled.  Certain rendering options trigger a prompt, to upgrade to Ultra version.

Is it something I'm missing?


Well done, thanks!"
,murphy78,2012-09-23T00:53Z,"Hmm.  Yes, this is downloaded from their website and simply altered.  So it's not like a scene release of a retail project.  It's more like those small nero web downloads that contain all of the information, but the installer is a little weird.  If anyone gets any sort of proper retail version cracked, by all means use that."

Take too long time or is the interest just not there?

Anyway, thanks for torrent. :)"
