Victory at Sea is a documentary television series[1] about naval warfare during World War II that was originally broadcast by NBC in the USA in 1952ΓÇô1953. It was condensed into a film in 1954. The music soundtrack, by Richard Rodgers and Robert Russell Bennett, was re-recorded and sold as record albums. The original TV broadcasts comprised 26 half-hour segmentsΓÇöSunday afternoons at 3pm (EST) in most marketsΓÇöstarting October 26, 1952[1] and ending May 3, 1953. The series, which won an Emmy award in 1954 as "best public affairs program", played an important part in establishing historic documentaries as a viable television genre.

The project was conceived by Henry Salomon,[1] who, while a U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander during World War II, was a research assistant to historian Samuel Eliot Morison. Morison was then writing the 15-volume History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. During this period, Salomon learned of the large amounts of film that the warring navies had compiled. Salomon left the Navy in 1948 and eventually discussed his idea of a documentary series with one of his Harvard classmates, Robert Sarnoff, a rising executive at NBC television and the son of David Sarnoff, the chairman of RCA (then the owner of NBC).

NBC approved the project in 1951, with Salomon as producer and a budget of $500,000 (large for that era). His team, composed largely of newsreel veterans, searched naval archives around the world, and received complete cooperation from the U.S. Navy, which recognized the publicity value. Salomon's team compiled 60 million feet (18,300 km) of film, which was edited to about 61,000 feet for broadcast.

After the original run, NBC syndicated it to local stations, where it proved successful financially through the mid-1960s. NBC also marketed the series overseas; by 1964, it had been broadcast in 40 foreign markets. NBC created a feature-length motion picture condensation. The feature-length version was narrated by Alexander Scourby who replaced Leonard Graves, the narrator of the 26-part series. NBC made a distribution deal with United Artists; the film debuted in mid-1954; NBC broadcast the movie twice during the 1960s.

The TV series won many honors including the Emmy and Peabody Award. For most modern viewers the score, script, and narration by Leonard Graves retain their appeal, but some knowledgeable viewers criticize the editing for anachronistic sequencesΓÇöfor example, ships and aircraft of 1943ΓÇô45 vintage in 1941ΓÇô42 segments.
