REQUIRES ANDROID:

GotYa! takes a silent snapshot through the front facing camera of the criminal who is attempting to use your device, whenever the screen lock is entered incorrectly.
After taking the picture, it acquires the location of your device and forms a Google maps link, and then send it with the time stamped picture to your email or Facebook !
Do you want to know who's using your device, stealing it, or just opening it up and snooping around on it for less than a beer price ? Yes, GotYa! is your choice!

Since GotYa! is a standalone program, it will NOT send your data to a remote server like others do.
GotYa! can be controlled through simple remote SMS commands, for example, you can :
- Lock/Unlock your device
- Request a location
- Request a callback
- Play an alarm sound (even if muted)
- Be notified on SIM change
The new Friendly Mode when enabled, will allow access to your device after a few wrong attempts, optionally sending the device location in the background and taking picture every time the user is present. This way the thief (or snooper) will potentially keep using the device to call friends and brag about their spoils.
This mode can be useful for WiFi-only devices (like tablets), since it will allow the thief (or snooper) to configure an access point.
This is the FULL version of GotYa!, with the following *outstanding* features :
- *FULL* size image capture
- Friendly mode
- Email/Facebook notifications support with location
- Remote SMS commands
- Smart screen ON capture trigger
- Queued system notifications support

Be sure to setup the system screen lock and that's it !
GotYa! doesn't need memory since GotYa! is deeply hooked into the screen lock. No service is needed : it only started on wrong login. It does NOT start long running services, except for sending emails. But it will shuts down as soon as finished.
