,thewojtek,2012-09-23T11:39Z,"Thank you. The keygen, however still doesn't work (no activation) on Snow Leopard + Core2Duo."
,signup321,2012-09-23T17:39Z,"Thank you! It's working. :)
Don't forget to reboot.

Download ""The Unarchiver"" for free from Appstore to unpack the 7z archive."
,nate_drake,2012-09-23T20:18Z,"@thewojtek: That is odd. Did you follow all the steps, like the patching of the App at the end?
Or maybe the keygen/patcher doesn't work well on SL?"
,MRGADGE54,2012-09-23T21:30Z,Has anyone got this working on MT Lion 10.8.2?????
,eldume809,2012-09-24T01:55Z,It's working on MT Lion 10.8.2
,thewojtek,2012-09-24T02:00Z,"@nate_drake: yeah, I did it on three computers and only the one running SL on a 2nd gen Core2Duo Mini doesn't work properly. The patch works OK, it's the activation that somehow doesn't go through. I tried to use the patched app and prefpane from a working install or putting the activation code by hand to the window that keeps on popping up, to no avail. Guess it's time to fork out these 15 bucks."

,paravians,2012-09-27T16:20Z,"If I try to lunch the keygen nothing happens (ML 10.8), if I try with Lion 10.7 I get a msg saying that some classic environment is not supported. WTF??"
,nate_drake,2012-09-28T04:05Z,"@paravians No idea. Maybe try changing your gatekeeper settings, as it's an ""external"" app."
