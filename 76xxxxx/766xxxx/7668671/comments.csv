,Scorpicore,2012-10-03T16:18Z,"So Jenny, what you are saying is, Scorpicore does not even care to check the movies and series he uploads?

Au contraire, mon fruitcake. I DL and watch ALL my uploads before re-uploading them. And why re-uploade? Because I am sure that there is alot of other people who wants a clean filename, and not one filled with a ripper's name and dot as space...

And you want to tell me that this vide of 5 pictures pr second? Pfff, get a better home cinema and stop watching it on your monitor..."
