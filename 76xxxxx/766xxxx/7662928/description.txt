***This free concert in Golden Gate Park consisted of one 105 minute set.
There are interesting comments in between songs, including attempts to get
a doctor's assistance at a birth.  The show begins with a great Help>Slip,
with a Franklin's Tower played separately later on.  This Franklin's is
different from most of the others I've heard (I LOVE IT).  A vocally sloppy
Truckin' leads into a unique jam in 11/4 which is different from the tune
'The Eleven'.  The post drums section of 'Stronger than Dirt>NFA>GDTRFB
is killer.    - From Deadbase

Jefferson Starship also played (not sure who opened)
