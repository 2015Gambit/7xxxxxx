,tommybertsen1,2012-09-24T03:04Z,thanks a lot! plays good on xperia arc s :)
,jimrx7,2012-09-24T04:18Z,the permissions that this App requests are worrisome to say the least. make sure you read all the permissions carefully before installing. 
,wyattspoppa,2012-09-25T03:42Z,"Downloaded and comes up as ""file"" not ""apk"", any tips? Thanks"
,ram789,2012-09-26T07:28Z,"@wyattspoppa rename the file to a .apk like ""rayman.apk""...and obviously this won't work on my shitty htc wildfire s :(
i hope someone optimises it for armv6 devices :/ ......."
