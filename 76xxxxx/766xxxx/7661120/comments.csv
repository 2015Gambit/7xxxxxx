This rips Lionsgate movies Hunger Games and Cabin in the Woods without obvious errors, but that resulting menu structure will not work on some standalone DVD players (freezes). So for best results copy the movie only, or reauthor the disk without the existing menus."

That's right, be the 1st to solve my DVDFab issue & I'll post $20 USD to your account via PayPal.

Here's the problem: In the Licensee column it says ""Trial User"" all the way down & in the Update Expire Time column it says ""2012-Oct-08"".

Here are the details: I have been SUCCESSFULLY installing & upgrading hacked DVDFab for years & NEVER a problem until recently!!!

1) YES I installed the DVDFab as an Administrator.
2) YES, I was sure to not run the program after installation.
3) YES I copied & pasted the msvcr90.dll in the correct folder.
4) YES I rebooted the machine, ensured the Internet connection was disabled, turned off ""Check for updates.""
5) YES my sytem time & date are correct.
6) YES, after I discovered the problem I used Revo Uninstaller Pro to completely remove all traces of DVDfab & I ALSO used regedit.exe to find even more traces (which I also removed)!
7) YES, my ""Sytem Locale Language"" is set to English

ANYONE wanna be a HERO & make a quick $20?!?"
