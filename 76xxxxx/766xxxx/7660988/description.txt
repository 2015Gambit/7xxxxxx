Video2brain - Introducing PHP

PHP is the most popular server-side language used to build dynamic websites, and though it is not especially difficult to use, non-programmers often find it intimidating. This workshop from author and trainer David Powers is designed to change that by teaching you PHP through a series of clear, focused, easy-to-follow lessons. After briefly explaining what PHP is and how it integrates with HTML, David will guide you through the setup and configuration of a PHP development environment on both Windows and Mac OS X. Then youΓÇÖll learn the features of the PHP language through a series of hands-on exercises before embarking on a larger project that involves building a script to validate and email user input from an online form. Through this project youΓÇÖll come to understand the value of creating reusable code, the importance of PHP security, and how to deal with multiple-choice form fields.
