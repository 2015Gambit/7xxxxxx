A Note from the Authors

Alarmed by personal experiences and reports that Islamists are using our countryΓÇÿs 
laws and multi-cultural activism to transform public schools into venues for spreading Islam, the Mission Viejo Chapter of ACT! for America created a  subcommittee to  investigate these concerns. In alliance with The United American Committee the Truth in  Education Subcommittee has researched and written the following Special Report. 

The goal of this Special Report is to awaken educators, publishers, parents, the 
media and American citizens to the systematic deception about Islam that is being taught  to our junior high school students. However, blatant Islamist propaganda is also a serious  problem in our high schools, colleges and universities.

This Report also exposes the organizations and individuals who are behind these 
deliberately false accounts of the true history, nature, and ambition of Islam. It concludes  with some preliminary recommendations on how to stop Islamic propaganda in AmericaΓÇÿs  schools. 

The authors believe it is crucial, for the protection of all AmericansΓÇÿ security, 
liberty and values, to guarantee the factual accuracy of our childrenΓÇÿs educationΓÇö
especially about Islam.
