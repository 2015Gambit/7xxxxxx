From a news article published Friday, Sept. 21:

There has been a lot of talk this week about the fact it looks like “Breaking Amish” is fake, and fans aren't sure what to believe. There is a Facebook page dedicated to the information that has popped up, and TLC has addressed the controversy to a degree. Friday, Sept. 21 a bit of new information came out that makes it seem as if the network is trying to deflect the responsibility for face it seems the show's premise is fake.

The Daily News shared Friday that the accusations that “Breaking Amish” is fake is now being deflected by the network back onto the stars of the hit reality television series. The site shares that their source told them “as filming went on, it became clear that this cast member, and possibly another one, had misrepresented themselves.” The source claims that all of the cast members were “vetted as thoroughly possible,” but “the Amish and Mennonite communities do not keep as accurate records as mainstream society.”"
