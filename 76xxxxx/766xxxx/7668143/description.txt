Book Description

This in-depth resource teaches you to craft mechanics that generate challenging, enjoyable, and well-balanced gameplay. YouΓÇÖll discover at what stages to prototype, test, and implement mechanics in games and learn how to visualize and simulate game mechanics in order to design better games. Along the way, youΓÇÖll practice what youΓÇÖve learned with hands-on lessons. A free downloadable simulation tool developed by Joris Dormans is also available in order to follow along with exercises in the book in an easy-to-use graphical environment.
