What is Space Hack?

Space Hack is a sci-fi RPG/action title 
with Diablo-inspired gameplay 
mechanics, presented in real-time 3D 
graphics. The story puts you on a quite 
peculiar space ship, full of convicted 
prisoners, that got trapped inside a cosmic 
anomaly known as Black Nebula. Playing 
role of a tough warrior you will be 
struggling to reach an emergency 
transporting module, hacking and slashing 
your way through hordes of alien creatures 
taking over your ship.

Pros

* 45 levels scattered throughout a variety of Earth-like biospheres
* 80-100 hours of gameplay
* A wide assortment of equipment including 40 different melee and shooting weapons, 13 hi-tech items, and 45 bio chips to enhance your hero
* 3-D graphics are rather nice and the ability to rotate the camera makes it easy to view the terrain

Cons

* Combat can get repetitive and less satisfying as you fight the same aliens over and over
* The pace seems awkward with level progression and item requirements, such as needing 45 strength to use a good sword
* Lack of meaningful audio for characters, story unfolds through text boxes which lessens feeling of immersion
