,k-macc,2012-09-25T04:05Z,is this missing the first 15 minutes of the movie
,vocalised80,2012-09-25T15:23Z,"So lets begin.........
One good thing is that it is in synch thru entire movie.
13min in Cam is hidden for 1 minute,sound is there but black out screen.
15min in same again but this time 1min 20sec.
both times it takes about 30 sec to re focus.
47:30 min black out again.
48:32 comes back from black out with sound but takes a good 2 min to re-focus.
54:15 black out again (get it together douche)
55:00 comes back and is in focus by this time.
01:09 half of will head is missing for 20 sec

Now i appreciate the effort, been waiting ages and when it's not moving around or re-focusing or the heavy nasal breathing that comes and goes as he re-focus's or what we think is also a heart beat for a few minutes towards the end (close enough to ur chest mate) oh yeh and the eating...... eat when u watch dude, not when ur getting this to give to others to watch, newbie mistake.
So make up ur own A/V and don't say that u have not been warned, me and the wife will def be watching a better copy.

@k-macc yes the first 10-15min is MISSING!!!"

,zguess,2012-09-26T00:57Z,"A-8
V-7 when its focused... and not staring at the floor
M-9 - but with this cam 6
take my word for it, wait for a better copy. Felt like tearing my hair out when the cam went black for what seemed like hours over and over again. "
,jayrockskee,2012-09-26T02:22Z,"It's about time a version o this at all showed up on here, but if you've already waited this long to watch this movie, then you might as well wait a bit longer. 

This upload isn't so bad but the audio is generic, as you would expect from a cam, but really gets in the way of enjoying the movie as you really have to strain to make out all of the words being spoken. After the first blackout I stopped watching.

The movie itself was funny as shit through the first few minutes though...

Thanks for the effort froggie"
