Focus by Leo Babauta 

Self-Help / Psychology / Productivity

A simplicity manifesto in the Age of Distraction. Focus shows us how to find the focus among all the digital distractions in our world, so that we can create, focus on what's important, and find time for quiet and contemplation.

The author writes, "At the heart of this simple book lies the key to many of the struggles we face these days, from being productive and achieving our goals, to getting healthy and fit in the face of fast food and inactivity, to finding simplicity and peace amidst chaos and confusion. That key is itself simple: focus. Our ability to focus will allow us to create in ways that perhaps we haven't in years. It'll allow us to slow down and find peace of mind. It'll allow us to simplify and focus on less-on the essential things, the things that matter most.
