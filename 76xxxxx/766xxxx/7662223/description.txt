The Killers - Go All the Way.

So, I kind of liked the song at the ending credits of the movie Dark Shadows (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1077368/)

It's a cover of the early 70s song Go All the Way, originally by The Raspberries. The versions I found on youtube was beyond crappy, so this is a rip from a BluRay version of the movie, downmixed from 48khz 7.1 DTS to 2 channels and transcoded to MP3 44.1khz.

Enjoy.
