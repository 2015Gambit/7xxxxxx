,fukin_fakes,2012-09-23T17:59Z,"FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! 

I knew it wouldn't be released this quick, and what do you know, the first 10 second is already showing the ""LIONSGATE"" intro.

This 'albiondean' posting fakes around and is a 'VIP' on here? Are you kidding me?"
,xminus1,2012-09-23T18:23Z,"This is in no way a fake.  I'll admit I had my doubts when I began DL'ing, but it is, indeed, the Beeb's coverage of the Singapore GP--of 2012, too.

Thank you for the wonderful job preparing and sharing--and for being so quick to get this up!"
,eriberto86,2012-09-23T18:24Z,"@fukin_fakes WTF is wrong with you, dude? You must really be retarded! Guys, IT""S LEGIT!!"
,cttc,2012-09-23T18:36Z,im pretty sure this isnt a fake considering the singapore buildup torrent was legit
,iluvjumpz,2012-09-23T19:22Z,"Thanks for this torrent!
