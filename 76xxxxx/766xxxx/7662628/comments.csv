,BlackSail4273,2012-09-23T00:15Z,"For those wondering why the torrent is so large - I included the soundtrack for Slender. This includes separate 2:00 tracks for pages 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7(320kbps), as well as a compilation of them all into a single 8:00 track(160kbps). There is also a 2:06 track with the sound of main menu for v0.9.7(320kbps)."
,BlackSail4273,2012-09-23T21:29Z,"... and one more thing if you noticed all the leeches - that would be me. When I first uploaded, the torrent wouldn't work properly (I forgot to port forward) and I had to restart it alot (so it looks like I leeched it). I've got it seeding pretty steady now and will continue as long as possible (probably about a week or so), but it's still not all that fantastic and I can't seed forever, so if you all could help out that would be great."
