,wetworx12,2012-09-23T21:21Z,Thank you for this.  Been looking for it. 
,pir8guy,2012-09-23T22:42Z,Is this legit?
,LindsayLohanite,2012-09-23T23:00Z,"ugh, i got to 95 percent and it stopped downloading so i dont know if this is fake or legit. just so you all know the 282 mb version called 2016--full-movie or 2016[Full movie] is legit. it is the whole movie but in a youtube 282mb video quality you would expect for that size. "
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-23T23:09Z,Is this one passworded like the last one I downloaded?
,LindsayLohanite,2012-09-23T23:17Z,stopped DLing 95% ugh
,JuggaloZeke,2012-09-23T23:41Z,"Sorry, went to take a nap and it stopped seeding for some reason. It's back on.

This is legit, but it is the one from YouTube. I ripped it from YT and re-encoded it to play on my stand-alone media player which really will only play AVI's.  I encoded the video at, IIRC, a 1200kb/s bitrate. I did this for myself and saw it wasn't on here so figured I'd U/L it for you guys."
,JamminJimmy,2012-09-24T01:15Z,"Dowloaded the Movie, no problem, seeding.  This movie is legit.  Its the real deal and v7a7.  Works great, and I've been waiting to see this, thank you uploader"
,freeis4me,2012-09-24T01:46Z,"This is the real deal, good job uploader, thank you!"
,mcdave45,2012-09-24T02:14Z,Thanks been looking for the real story!!!
,JuggaloZeke,2012-09-24T02:28Z,"For those interested in a smaller download in FLV format, the YouTube rip, I just uploaded that here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7666389"
,Mega_troll,2012-09-24T02:46Z,"@JuggaloZeke

,nutpn,2012-09-24T03:23Z,"so this was on youtube,how in the world did it get there,but main ? is how did u download it from there,I need that,I am all the time wanting youtube downloads.
but the one I had wouldnt download it,thanks again for this.."
,Ajube0476,2012-09-24T03:36Z,"@nutpn
Internet Download Manager (or ""IDM"" for short) is a great lil' program that will allow you to DL videos off of YouTube.
There are many other programs out there too.. that I am sure other people can point you towards. IDM is what I use and I love it."
,JuggaloZeke,2012-09-24T03:38Z,"@nutpn, I use an extension called Download Helper that lets you download any embedded objects in a webpage."
,nutpn,2012-09-24T04:09Z,thanks for the movie and info
,zauriel80,2012-09-24T08:10Z,"I wish there was a better resolution copy out there than the YouTube rip, but it'll do. This is definitely the full and actual movie, so download in confidence. I don't really see that much difference in this larger file over the smaller one though, so if you're just interested in file size, I'd say you're safe sticking with the little one. Thanks for the UL, JuggaloZeke!"
,TPBGurl,2012-09-24T09:41Z,"I luv you Juggalo! lol 
Iseen so many fakes it was driving me nuts! TY4UL :))"
,MLO89,2012-09-24T21:42Z,Finally a legit one. I didn't want to have to go to the theater to see it so now I'm watching it at home. The scary thing about this movie is that this pretender to the white house is probably going to get re-elected. Lots of idiots out there that are going to vote for this dude again. Unbelievable.
,steelllynx,2012-09-24T22:12Z,"640x480, mp3 128kbps
v7a5

good job.  hard to believe it survived on yt long enough to get it."
,epiconedude,2012-09-25T06:51Z,this is the real deal -- by that i mean the torrent is real AND the content of the documentary is legit.  EVERYONE needs to see this movie whether you like obama or not
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T17:20Z,"Great documentary.  It lacks the Hollywood polish of a Michael Moore film, but it more than makes up for it with substance and facts.

(Multiple popular copies are causing peer fragmentation.  To help consolidate, please search TPB for ""obama 2016"" and download the one with the most seeds.)"
,blackdiamondstrutter1,2012-09-27T06:23Z,anyone expecting anything of substance from this movie will be disappointed. The guy filming it appears to be attention starved and somewhat of a nerd. I am wondering what all the fuss is about. Is this suppose to be a pro or con obama movie?
,Buckwheat409,2012-09-27T18:50Z,"If you can't figure out if this movie is good or bad for obama, then you are a complete and total fool. For the rest of us who have common sense, it is clear that obama does not have our best interests in mind when it comes to leading our country.  The man is dangerous."
