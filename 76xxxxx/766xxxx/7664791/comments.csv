,Fangular,2012-09-23T17:42Z,"And @zirnis - you must have heard this a million times already, but just to remind you - useVLC to play your shows! It plays pretty much every format (on any type of computer) without a hitch so you won't need to convert anything to anything else... surely you've heard of it!?"
