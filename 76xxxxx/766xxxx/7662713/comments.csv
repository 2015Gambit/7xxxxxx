,riodoro01,2012-09-23T00:46Z,Thanks again.
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:13Z,You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files! More formats would be great! Especially the old proper xvid releases!
[V],meech,2012-09-23T01:46Z,No you should not (see above comment). Welcome to quality Mr. Butt_sex
,Fuse_410,2012-09-23T02:11Z,"I wish torrenting was still hard enough that leechers would at least know how to convert files to the format they need rather than complain about free stuff.

Thanks for the HQ upload. eztv is always the best."

Your options:

1) Torrent AVC (Any Video Converter) and use that.
2) Get VLC like the rest of the civilized (torrenting) world. and watch it on your computer.
3)Look for this device called a HDMI cable (or VGA Cable if you're non-HD) and hook your computer up to your TV.

4) (and this is a must)....stop bitching about something that is illegally being provided freely to you."
,zeighy,2012-09-23T02:40Z,"lol, BUTT_SEX

You really need to understand how things work around here...

1) extv only shares, and not encodes these stuff
2) there are standard formats and releases that each mainstream groups (such as FoV) follows... They don't just encode in x264 because they want to... but rather it is a recognized standard
3) the old xvid/divx avi standard is OLD and being phased out by the new standard. Live with it.
4) you always post this exact same comment, stfu because no matter how hard you try to request, either wait for someone to do it for you or do it yourself because neither will eztv or FoV gives any fcks about your concern."

Your comment is bad and you should feel bad."
,DrSun,2012-09-24T09:04Z,"00101010 and I seem to have had a similar experience BUTT_SEX. These work fine on a PS3. Hopefully when episode five releases, your comment won't be there...again."

No, thanks.

> My PS3 doesn't like this high quality file
Then you may use a proper mediaplayer

And thanks to eztv for the upload :3"
