yes, this is a real app store os x 10.8.2.
this is not a install.dmg, this a Install OS X Mountain Lion app."
,Ertavarez,2012-09-23T14:33Z,"This is not the mountain lion app, is the install mountain lion DMG."
,Towelhead,2012-09-23T14:38Z,"this is not a install.dmg, this a Install OS X Mountain Lion app.

really?

then why does it say .dmg at the end in the torrent app?
why not upload the original app version?"

,Towelhead,2012-09-24T03:17Z,"Ok. I will wait till it's downloaded.
So i guess you made a dmg out of the app version instead of zipping it.
That's cool.
Thanx!"
,Towelhead,2012-09-24T11:34Z,"It says version 12C53 in info.plist
Is that correct?"
,xereba,2012-09-24T13:00Z,"Towelhead 

Right-click (or Control+click) the installer, and choose Show Package Contents, open Contents- Shared Support, mount InstallESD.dmg, open System, Library, CoreServices, SystemVersion.plist.
