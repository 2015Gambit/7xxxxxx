[V],psspss,2012-09-24T11:34Z, for psychics.. check out sensing murder NZ
[V],psspss,2012-09-24T11:35Z,"they take 100 psychics and put a solved case non public details and found only 6 passed with
80 percent or 100 percent of the case

and use them for solving or trying to for cold cases

they are sat in a room alone with just camera crew with a photo face down and they describe the person and give their exact name and birthday with no cold reading or hints"
[V],psspss,2012-09-24T11:37Z,"and for UFOs if you watched Out of the Blue and greatest story ever denied ufo docus Im sure it would change your mind

after all you have astronauts coming out and saying they saw them and know they arent from earth"
,tibird,2012-09-24T15:23Z,well I dunno about that but I sense that I seeded to a 3.8 ratio and there was only 7 seeds when I started and theres 18 now so I think ive done my part.
