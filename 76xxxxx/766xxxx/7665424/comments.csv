,Ajube0476,2012-09-24T19:21Z,"The PS3 can play any size video file.. I have many movies on my PS3 that are 16gb and even higher.
You can copy video files from your PC to your PS3 through your router using PS MediaServer or some other MediaServer. 
Once again gozinya demonstrates what a n00b he is.
Can't even properly seed his own torrents. smh"
,gozinya,2012-09-24T20:36Z,"Ajube, you again? I know the PS3 can handle any size file, you idiot. Some people prefer smaller size, especially if they have a vast collection on their PC or PS3. And I seed my torrents, dumbass. It likely stopped (or actually just slowed to a crawl) for speeding cheetah simply because of the seeder/leecher ratio, it happens...or did you not know that? I have had no further complaints. Why don't you just take your obnoxious shit to a site where somebody like you?"
,gozinya,2012-09-24T20:38Z,"When I said ""easy viewing on the PS3"" I meant because it's MP4, but I guess that's over your head, genius."
,Lord-Darkstorn,2012-09-24T21:01Z,Rip looks great so far. Can't wait to watch! Gracias gozinya
