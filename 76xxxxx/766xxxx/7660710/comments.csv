Boss S02E06 HDTV x264 + Subtitles [GlowGaze]

This is an XviD AVI file, however, and the corresponding EVOLVE x264 rip is only 340MB at a higher resolution. 

I understand GlowGaze has a skull and a history here, but this one threw off my RSS feed reader. Anyone else with the same problem? Am I missing out on a better rip (but avi? need more compatibility, man)?"

I usually upload the x264 version so I forgot to change the name of the torrent this time 

I apologize again for any inconvenience caused by that"
