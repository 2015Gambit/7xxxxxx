POtHS - Bible Study - 01 - Chuck Missler -  Line by Line - OT and NT - Genesis thru Revelation


POtHS Comment: I have been forced to upload only the Genesis and Revelation Chapters here because of The Folder size of the entire 66 books of The Holy Bible. Included in the Torrent is the Torrent File for The rest of the Bible. I Think you can just click it to load but you may have to drag and drop it. 4 of my biggest websites would not allow a 13 gig upload, so this is my Remedy.

Thank you,
YBIJesus,

Here is the The Whole Word of Yahweh, Creator of The Universe. Every Line of The Holy Bible Explained in Laymans terms. This is the divine Word of God, 66 Books and 40 Authors inspired by The Holy Spirit, The Power of Yahweh and His Son Jesus.

Chuck Missler is my favorite Bible Scholar. He has a degree in Physics from The Navel Academy, Knows the Bible inside and out, LOVES JESUS, speaks Greek and Hebrew and can prove the Bible is The Divine Word of Yahweh our Creator with Math and Science. He is the Grand PUPA of all Bible Scholars. (in my humble opinion)

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
