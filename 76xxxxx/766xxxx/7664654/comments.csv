,Kashim22,2012-09-23T13:23Z,"I heard that the update fixes the bug of unlimited golden keys.. 

(Use Notepad to open up the WillowDLC.ini file located in the GAME FOLDERDLCPOPremierClubLic folder. Edit the file similar to the following:

[GoldenKeys]
+SourceId=254
+NumKeys=99

...to get 99 golden keys. )"
,shauwy,2012-09-23T13:26Z,"Dam why aftr this update i van't load the game nothing happen 
Little help please?"
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-23T14:06Z,"@Kashim22 

That's correct. It does patch that. In testing this, the way to get around it would be to edit your keys, then update. Then change your WillowDLC.ini back to saying +NumKeys=1 and then update. You should still have your keys.

@shauwy
If you edited your WillowDLC.ini for the keys, you'll have to change the number of keys back to 1. If you dont, then your game will have an error and wont launch. Try doing that if you did give yourself those keys."
,vrt1,2012-09-23T14:07Z,You need to start new game.
,kibblesandbits,2012-09-23T15:28Z,I don' think this works for 64 bit windows 7/8. The first crack had that same problem and required a fix. O well 
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-23T15:59Z,"@kibblesandbits
Windows 8 has it's problems with this game.
Worked perfectly fine for me and i'm on Windows 7 64-bit.

Never had a problem with the first crack either."
,kibblesandbits,2012-09-23T17:10Z,Oh yea my bad it needs steam installed to run. I formatted a new windows 7 so I didn't get to it yet. 
,Kashim22,2012-09-23T18:56Z,Is there a way to make cracked Borderlands 2 recognise the saves from first game? I want that custom head :D
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-23T22:04Z,"@Kashim22

As long as you have your Borderlands save games in the default save location (My Games in My Documents) it should be detected automatically."
,topk,2012-09-23T22:19Z,How come this one is 18MB and the other one from scene4all is 37MB?
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-24T00:05Z,"@topk

When it's RARed, it's compressed, making it 18.88 MB.

The other one is unpacked, which makes it a larger download, but the same files."
,kerballer,2012-09-24T02:20Z,"I blue screen everytime, even after installing the update. Help please"
,kevin003,2012-09-24T08:49Z,Buckner?

,lolindir356,2012-09-24T14:10Z,"hi, im confused wether to install this update or not. i want to play coop through tunngle. but it said to block the program through firewall, it'll disable lan multiplayer right ?"
,axxle,2012-09-24T15:22Z,how do i unpack?
,anirmj1,2012-09-24T15:58Z,"@ lolindir356

I'm using a ver from Ka0s, and its working fine even with tunngle. I haven't blocked it with any firewall for obvious reason. Also, all this update does is block the skeleton key exploit and nothing else. So, like me if ur game is working without any issues, theres no point in updating it right now. Wait for future updates that provides significant changes before updating :D"
,anirmj1,2012-09-24T16:03Z,"@ axxle

u can use softs like 7zip/winrar for unpacking.
if u r using it for the 1st time, then, install any of the above two softs>>double click the downloaded package>>(if it doesn't associate automatically then) use Open/Open with>>browse from installed softwares>>search for the location where u installed the above software>>choose the .exe (7zip/winrar)>>Hit Ok>>done...

njoy :)"
,axxle,2012-09-24T16:20Z,"ok, ive unpacked it and all, now when i load up the B2Launcher, it says ""Unable to launch, are you sure you placed the file at the right directory"" any help?"
,axxle,2012-09-24T16:23Z,"and when i go to boot it up, it says nvtt.dll is missing from your computer"
,novice90k,2012-09-25T23:08Z,Could you upload the 1.0.2 update? Just came out today (Sept 25th)
[V],alexisthebest,2012-09-26T08:54Z,"Yes, there is a 2nd update (1.0.2) but there still isnt an update by SKIDROW.

I'm sure someone will have it uploaded once it's actually released."
,spikeabercrombie,2012-09-27T19:54Z,need 1.0.3 (Update 3) now =/
,SNYPER_,2012-09-29T19:28Z,"Yah retails up to v1.0.3  would be nice to be able to play with retail friends,im surprised the updates are lacking borderlands 1 was updated real fast."
