Rubber Soul is the sixth studio album by the English rock group The Beatles, released in December 1965. Produced by George Martin, Rubber Soul was recorded in just over four weeks to make the Christmas market. Unlike the five albums that preceded it, Rubber Soul was recorded during a specific period, the sessions not dashed off in between either tour dates or during filming projects.[1] After this, every Beatles album would be made without the need to pay attention to other commitments, except for the production of short promotional films or principal photography and editing to Magical Mystery Tour. The album was described as a major artistic achievement, attaining widespread critical and commercial success, with reviewers taking note of The Beatles' developing musical vision.

Rubber Soul was successful commercially and critically, and is often cited as one of the greatest albums in music history.[3][4][5][6] In 2012, Rubber Soul was voted 5th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".


The album was released on compact disc 30 April 1987, with the 14-song UK track line-up now the international standard. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the 14 track UK version of the album was issued on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. As with the Help! album, Rubber Soul featured a contemporary stereo digital remix of the album prepared by George Martin. Martin expressed concern to EMI over the original 1965 stereo remix, claiming it sounded 'very woolly, and not at all what I thought should be a good issue'. George Martin went back to the original four-tracks tapes and remixed them for stereo.

A newly-remastered version of the album, again utilising the 1987 George Martin remix, was released worldwide with the reissue of the entire catalogue on September 9, 2009. The original 1965 stereo and mono mixes were reissued on that date as part of the mono box set.
