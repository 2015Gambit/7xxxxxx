,dragonballz,2012-09-25T04:58Z,"Fake You, it's not 256kbps."
,metalkiwi,2012-09-25T07:43Z,"Sound quality is decent for a transcode, not 256kbps as others have said. Pity the album is so disappointing though. The Resistance was far more impressive, two tracks on this album sound like they used a different vocalist and only a couple of songs really stand out. Too many soft songs that sound bland. Hope they put in a better effort with their next album in another couple of years."
,ricklongo,2012-09-25T15:32Z,"@Metalkiwi - Really? I like what I've heard so far a lot. Very reminiscent of Origin of Symmetry, which is probably their best album. And heh, I also happen to think The Resistance was by far their least impressive record yet. Different strokes for different folks."
,xquixotic,2012-09-25T20:12Z,"@Metalkiwi ; Two of the songs are a different vocalist... the bassist is singing lead for the first time in the band's history. 

Cheers MFATeam, this is the best torrent I've found for the album yet. I was happy with Resistance, but I enjoy this album more. It has this 70-80s feel (Queen, Bowie, Prince, etc) ... which I absolutely love, because it doesn't feel like they tried too hard to make it that way, it just is. "
,metalkiwi,2012-09-26T11:16Z,"@xquixotic, that at least explains the different vocals then :)

@ricklongo, what I mean is, I find that I can listen to any track from The Resistance at least a few times even on the same day and not get sick of them, whereas the song Panic Station was one I couldn't even listen to more than once - even just getting through the first listen was trying enough. However, Survival, Supremacy and a couple other songs, heck even Madness, all sounded good at worst. I really enjoyed supremacy. Agree with you about the older albums, they were brilliant. Songs like City of Delusion, Plug In Baby, Exo-Politics, Knights of Cydonia etc are all classics. Just was hoping to hear better than Panic Station, that song really irritates me for some reason."
