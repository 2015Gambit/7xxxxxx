,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T00:50Z,"Why such a small file size? I get the feeling I'm gonna have to start uploading these files in proper Xvid/avi format, the file size should be 350ish Minimum or up to 430-480MBish. Audio at 128kbps. I'd seriously be doing this already but I live in U.S. and can't get to the episode fast enough. "
,MP4SUX,2012-09-23T01:05Z,"Check the stats - small filesize is the result of the source file (FOV 720p) and the 768 Kbps bitrate. I did pick 160 for audio.

Would love to have your entries! I actually got started about an hour late today - so first isn't everything when XVID is desired in an ""MP4 only Scene"" universe.

I'd list sources, but it's tricky using actual URLs around here.

and of course, here at good ol' TPB

Jump in, the water's fine (get a good VPN)"

,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:11Z,"Whoops wrong comment, haha. Yes, I'm highly considering it. Though the thing is I'm usually out of town when it comes out. Like I am now."

I guess it would now be OPC or OPDSL ..."
,Ibarehere,2012-09-23T02:09Z,"Thank You MP4sux.
You got my vote as you seem t o be the only one still uploading avi files.
My kids love the doctor but our media player on tv wont play MP4 only AVI.
So a Big Thank You and You will be getting my patronage on your torrents.
Keep up the Good work"

Just you and nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone ... Poo poo bee doo

Seriously, there is an evil Scene empire
They must be fought on every cyber-front
AVI was down for the count and then John Conner ...
Whoops, wrong cyborg.

You want proof?
I think they're Canadian!
First they club baby seals and now this!
All this time no problems with AVI
And then (and then ...) along came Jones ...
Slow walking Jones,
Slow talking Jones,
Along came long legged lanky Jones.

Fight the power - we have the power to rebuild the Internet ...
Six Million Dollar Cyborg ... Cyborg ... Borg ...
something has gone horribly worng ...

Just take a look at all the damaged MP4 encodes
You'd rather fight than switch!
Join the team that fights the monoply that has taken over ...
YOUR InterNet!"
