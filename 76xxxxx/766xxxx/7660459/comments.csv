,tibird,2012-09-22T14:21Z,As I said on part 1 i'm a michigan fan but woody was a great coach. and the great michigan coach bo schembechler coached under woody. so good enough for bo good enough for me. I really felt bad the way he got fired and everything for hitting that player. he really was a great coach and a great asset to the university. In my opinion he deserved better than he got.
