About the game:

Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. 
Released on Steam on November 30, 2004, it uses many of the assets from Half-Life 2, and the same Source engine.
It features unique levels, optimized for multiplayer arena play, and a few new weapons.
Also included are portions of the game's source code, which were the basis for many early Source-based multiplayer modifications.
The game is the successor to the popular multiplayer component of the original Half-Life, but is offered as a separate product from Half-Life 2. 
Deathmatch, like Half-Life multiplayer, does not develop any part of the plot or story of the Half-Life series.
