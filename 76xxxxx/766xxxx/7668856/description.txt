You loved popping those mean pigs with your angry birds :). See if you do just as well now that the pigs respond in kind!

HOW TO PLAY
Use the slingshot to aim at your opponent and launch a projectile. Hit the enemy warbot and attempt to defeat them before they get you first! Customize your warbot with up to 3 special weapons to gain an advantage over your opponent!
You can play in the Warbots worldwide league and compete against other Warbots players to rise in the ranking.
You can also challenge friends in a 1v1 online multiplayer match to see who will prevail.
Warbots requires internet connection for league or challenge play. When offline, you can practice your skills against a training warbot controlled by the computer. Practice games do not count towards any statistics.
