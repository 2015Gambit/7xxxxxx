,FlamingDonkey,2012-09-27T09:41Z,"i get a message that says ""the program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from you computer. try reinstalling the program"
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-09-27T12:57Z,"Make sure you have all the latest drivers and .net framework 4 installed. It's needed by the game to run. And MSVCR100.dll is related to MS Visual c++ Redistributable, you can download it on the MS website.
"
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-09-27T13:29Z,"Anyone who's having problems, that the game isn't running: 

1. Go to your app folder Borderlands - Binaries - Redist and install the dotNetFx and vrcredist packages found there. 

2. Users with an AMD CPU should also install the AMDsetup in the AMD folder found there.

Tested the game on an Intel CPU, Win 7 x 86 and x64, runs smooth. Make sure u have everything installed, before running the game! Keep your drivers etc up to date, than shit like this doesn't happen."
