,blazebuny,2012-09-24T05:57Z,pretty sure its real
,zerofah,2012-09-25T05:38Z,"maybe not fake, but the TS mode type.
Not sure it's good already .... anyone have donwloaded, please do comment on it's quality"
,Tyeen,2012-09-25T07:16Z,"Dled, Cam version"
,whereiamnot,2012-09-25T19:33Z,"it's a cam blown up to 1080p - just waste of download time, it's SD quality material, meaning 720x304 or something. Video is like a cam, average, sound is pretty good. I would rate it V5 A7 but fuk da uploader for maka it FullHD. After a resize it's SD and 500 MB as MP4 or MKV and shows exactly the same than here. For sure it's not a HD cam or if, 90% pixels lost in transformation, tilt kill, filtering, gamma correction etc"
,whereiamnot,2012-09-25T21:04Z,it is obviously the real movie but definitively not TS. pls someone shirink it to SD and reseed it with 700 MB filesize
,tflagger997,2012-09-28T22:51Z,"Vote the quality down to get rid of this fake.  It is not 1080p, it is not HiRes.  Just another spam of questionable quality from Green Skull groups."
