The court sends him to a mental asylum, where amidst all the apathy and contempt he finds a doctor Sudeshna who takes him under her wing. Piklu reminds her of her dead son. As part of the therapy Sudeshna takes Piklu to her home, but as Piklu makes innocent observations, the facade of her happy home breaks up. Sudeshna's husband is two timing her and this becomes apparent, Her daughter has gone wayward and Piklu sees through her, Sudeshna's sister in law, her lover and his wife are caught in a love triangle from which none seem to find an escape.
