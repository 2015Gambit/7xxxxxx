Get Started Fast with Modern OpenGL ES Graphics Programming for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad

OpenGL ES technology underlies the user interface and graphical capabilities of AppleΓÇÖs iPhone, iPod touch, and iPadΓÇôas well as devices ranging from video-game consoles and aircraft-cockpit displays to non-Apple smartphones. In this friendly, thorough introduction, Erik M. Buck shows how to make the most of  Open GL ES in AppleΓÇÖs iOS environment.

This highly anticipated title focuses on modern, efficient approaches that use the newest versions of  OpenGL ES, helping you avoid the irrelevant, obsolete, and misleading techniques that litter the Internet. Buck embraces Objective-C and Cocoa Touch, showing how to leverage AppleΓÇÖs powerful, elegant GLKit framework to maximize your productivity, achieve tight platform integration, and deliver exceptionally polished apps.

If youΓÇÖve written C or C++ code and know  object-oriented programming basics, this title  brings together everything you need to fully  master OpenGL ES graphics for iOSΓÇôincluding  downloadable examples specifically designed to  jumpstart your own projects.

Coverage includes
- Understanding core OpenGL ES computer graphics concepts and iOS graphics architecture
- Integrating Cocoa Touch with OpenGL ES to leverage the power of AppleΓÇÖs platform
- Creating textures from start to finish: opacity, blending, multi-texturing, and compression
- Simulating ambient, diffuse, and specular light
- Using transformations to render 3D geometric objects from any point of view
- Animating scenes by controlling time through application logic
- Partitioning data to draw expansive outdoor scenes with rolling terrain
- Detecting and handling user interaction with 3D geometry
- Implementing special effects ranging from skyboxes to particles and billboards
- Systematically optimizing graphics performance
- Understanding the essential linear algebra concepts used in computer graphics
- Designing and constructing a complete simulation that incorporates everything youΓÇÖve learned
