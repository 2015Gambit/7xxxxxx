its a new band called Mist within . they first music : 
lyrics : 
the time is passing by
And I can hear the last lullaby My wishes now are out of reach
The futureΓÇÖs hope starts to bleach
My damned fortune is getting pale
Our splendour is now setting sail
All around me is obscene
Their bloody breath is full of sin
[Chorus:]
Just tell me why I was born
And why I exist to face this endless mourn
And tell me is that destiny
To spit a nameless corpse which is called me?
The angel of pain is my master
My destiny is just disaster
But fire will rise from ash and dust
I wonΓÇÖt stop by the hand of frost
It must be end.. be ended soon
Then this plaintive land may have to bloom
[Chorus:]
Just tell me why I was born
And why I exist to face this endless mourn
And tell me is that destiny
To spit a nameless corpse which is called me?
But noΓÇªIΓÇÖm not that braveΓÇª
ItΓÇÖs a truth that I have to face
