CAMPO is a musical project and band created by musician and producer Juan Campodonico.

The project mixes indie pop, electro, folk and rock with tango, cumbia and 50┬┤s and 60ΓÇÖs latin music, blending them into an updated and sophisticated pop context, with tracks performed in both English and Spanish.

CAMPO define their style as ΓÇ£Subtropical MusicΓÇ¥. The term marks an ironic way of setting the differences with tropical music and also makes nods to other genres such as cumbia villera, the urban sound born and bred in the marginal neighborhoods of Argentina and Uruguay.
