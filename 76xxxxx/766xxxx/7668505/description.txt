Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland is a concert DVD, Blu-ray and double CD by Canadian rock band Rush released on November 8, 2011. It was filmed on April 15, 2011 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio during the band's Time Machine Tour. The DVD film was recorded by Banger Productions, which had previously produced the Rush documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage. The Moving Pictures portion of the concert was released on vinyl under the title Moving Pictures: Live 2011.

Captured in April at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena during the renowned trio's extensive Time Machine World Tour, "TIME MACHINE 2011: LIVE IN CLEVELAND" marks the band's first live album recorded at a U.S. show, a deliberate nod of gratitude to the first city to support Rush on its radio airwaves. The wildly popular tour featured a set filled with classic hits, fan favorites, and a glimpse into Rush's forthcoming 20th studio album "CLOCKWORK ANGELS." As a centerpiece for the concerts, the band performed their landmark album "MOVING PICTURES" in its entirety -- a first in the band's long and illustrious career.
