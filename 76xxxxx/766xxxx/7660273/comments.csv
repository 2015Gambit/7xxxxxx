,cybergodsig,2012-09-23T19:37Z,"Well I'm using 2.0 beta audiochecker and I got mpeg results.  I would think that the newer version would have bugs fixed.  Like I said the single Rush albums I posted are 100% CDDA, the rest were MPEG."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-23T19:52Z,"Look at your results, see that The Big Money is MPEG.  Hemispheres, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure and Power Windows have MPEG files in them, not all of them.  They are there.  So in conclusion, I stick with the MFSL for Moving Pictures and Signals.  The rest I grabbed from the sectors box.  I've searched all over the net to find those originals and can't find any anywhere.  "
