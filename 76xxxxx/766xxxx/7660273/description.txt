A little test for the Rush fans out there or just lovers of good recordings....

Here are some files of Rush songs from West German Mercury releases from the late 80's and the same songs from the Sector Box Set released in 2011.

Which do you prefer?

What sounds better or "best" to you?

If you listen to some small MP3 player while riding your bike (and maybe delivering papers) or running through the playground it might be difficult to hear the differences.....

Enjoy!
