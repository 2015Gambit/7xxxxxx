,boyznacne,2012-09-23T16:00Z,"Any info on what was updated?

I remember the first update was solely for multiplayer and it was technically useless for offline single player users."
,susulock,2012-09-23T20:08Z,will this work? the previous one didn't. made me uninstall the whole game and not install the update at all for the game to work. And should I install the previous update for this one to work?
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-09-23T20:28Z,"You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this update is featuring all previous updated content. "
