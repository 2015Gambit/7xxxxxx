In the year 2065, the next great assault against an invading race of phantom-like aliens is 
about to be launched. Dr. Aki Ross, a brilliant young scientist, races to find the invaders' 
secrets, not only to save the planet, but herself as well after her body is infected by alien 
particles. She teams up with the prestigious Deep Eyes military squadron, led by her old friend 
Grey Edwards. But as Aki, her mentor Dr. Sid, and Grey work toward a peaceful end, the scheming 
General Hein devises a plot to eradicate the aliens in one swift, destructive blow...even if it 
destroys the Earth right along with them
