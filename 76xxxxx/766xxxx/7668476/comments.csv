Thank You So Much Man :]

,gumph1688,2012-09-26T01:07Z,what does clearing the cache do?
,dmarz45,2012-09-26T01:30Z,"I think cleaning the cache deletes all the temporary data used for burning your disks. I always clear the cache before each burn.

Wheres the RF version? I know America doesn't like soccer but c'mon man!! I don't even like soccer however I love this game!!"
,Deega,2012-09-26T01:49Z,"I'm sorry my problem with ""Clean the Disc"" is for this link: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7668331/FIFA_13_PAL_XBOX360-COMPLEX"

,weezl3,2012-09-26T13:33Z,"@fifacrusher

Yes, you can. But no1 can know for sure if it's safe.

To be as safe as possible >
Newest LT+ v3.0, run game through agbx and burn with burn with burner with Burner Max Firmware. Don't use trunctate because you'll probably fail civ checks so you probably get flagged then. Don't do dashboards updates from disc, use USB or just with XBOX live.

Good luck.

,davletov88,2012-09-26T13:40Z,"Dashboard languages? I know that there's no spanish audio, but is there spanish dashboard and stuff?"
,emil941011,2012-09-26T14:08Z,will the game work if i overburn it?
,nrandall465,2012-09-26T14:12Z,shit dont work burnt through a ihas 224b drive and still saying disk unreadable
,winterbed,2012-09-26T15:07Z,Is there a way to get this to work without iHas Burner?
,asrocker,2012-09-26T16:01Z,I don't know why people are having problems with this it works great. I have IHAS drive and LT+3.0 works exactly the same as every other XGD3 game I have. If your having issues you are doing something wrong.
,megaGOD,2012-09-26T16:49Z,"So, clearing the HD cache didn t helped??? And if u wanna play online, just wait for abgx verified, maybe tomorow!!!! I just check abgx site, still nothing, when the game officially comes out then will be verified, and then burn :)"

Does anybody have a solution?"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-03T16:03Z,"#Daky1001 
probably you need to play a song from a USB till the game starts n then remove the usb n you wont get that message anymore"
,Daky1001,2012-10-03T18:14Z,"@Assassinprofessor When do I remove USB?
I tried with MP3 song but I didn't know i had to remove USB.
P.S. Thank you very much for your help,I am desperate."

why, but game works"
,fedep90,2012-10-04T07:43Z,"For those without recorder ihas and get disc error message. The only way to play it, is to install the game on a hard drive. I install it on an external drive formatted when i plugged into my xbox. After installation, we have to have another disk or pendrive formatted in FAT32 with music in MP3 or WMA. With everything plugged in, you have to go to my applications and to play music of the pendrive. With music playing on background, Go to play FIFA 13. Now enjoy the game. If you want after to stop music, go to xbox menu and stop the music in multimedia, then continue playing. Enjoy!"
