All-new Attacking Intelligence infuses players with the most sophisticated
artificial intelligence ever achieved. Players have the ability to analyze
space, work harder and smarter to break down the defense, and think two
plays ahead. Now every touch matters with the most comprehensive and
intuitive dribbling system ever developed for the franchise. Inspired by
the world's best player, Lionel Messi, Complete Dribbling enables players
to face their opponent and use precise dribble touches combined with true
360 mobility with the ball, so it's easier to be more creative and
dangerous in 1v1 opportunities. FIFA Soccer 13 1st Touch Control transforms
the way players control the ball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every
player on the pitch, and creating more opportunities for defenders to win
back possession. The second generation of the Player Impact Engine expands
physical play from just collisions to off-the-ball battles between players.
Defenders can push and pull for position, and utilize their size and
strength to force opponents into poor touches and decisions before the ball
arrives. FIFA Soccer 13 Tactical Free Kicks provides the tools to create
dangerous and unpredictable free kicks. Position up to three players over
the ball and utilize dummy runs and more passing options to outwit your
opponent

 
ENJOY !
