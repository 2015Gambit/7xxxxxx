PLOT:

Players assume the role of being a member of the Elite Penguin Force, a more higher rank of the Penguin Secret Agency in Club Penguin. Gary the Gadget Guy, known as Agent G, is missing after building helper robots to help him test his inventions to make sure that he is safe. The robots go hay wire and start to create more inventions to test. Gary plans on capturing the robots, but ends up in the Mine, where the player finds him. By the time G is rescued by the player, he has suffered memory loss. Soon, the penguins find oil cans, which means that the robots are still on the island. The player soon finds the robots and finds pages of Gary's notebook. After this, the player has been told by G to find and hunt down the robots and deactivate them, put them in a bubble, and then give them to G. After, the player has to defeat the Protobot 10,000, the robot the Testbots were creating. The player has to rescue the Elite Puffles and eventually rescues G.
