Ross Kemp Extreme World Season 1

Ross Kemp: Extreme World is a documentary series shown on Sky1. The show is hosted by actor Ross Kemp.

On the show, Kemp travels around the world talking to people involved in illicit trades, locals who have been affected by violence and hardship, and the authorities who are attempting to combat the problems. In each episode he attempts to establish contacts within the groups in order to get close to the ringleaders.

This series focuses upon five different countries. It begins in Chicago, in the American state of Illinois with an investigation into the illegal heroin trade, where Kemp interviews drug dealers and gets a close-up perspective of the addicts. The second episode in Democratic Republic of the Congo looked at child labour and prisons. In Mexico, the focus was on the infamous drug trade and gang culture. The fourth episode in Haiti considers how far the country has moved on from the tragic earthquake in 2010, but Kemp also finds a more sinister side of gun culture. The final episode was produced in Kemp's native London.
