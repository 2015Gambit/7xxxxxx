As seen on public television.Absolutely Irish! brings together the brightest stars of traditional Irish music for a once-in-a-lifetime concert that will leave folk music fans stunned by the virtuoso performances.In April 2007 at the Irish Arts Center in the fabled Hell's Kitchen area of New York City, film maker Paul Wagner and musician and producer Mick Moloney brought some of the finest Irish musicians, singers and dancers in America together for a special one-off concert. All the artists had known one another and played together in various combinations for years, but this was a chance to meet up in an informal situation and simply have fun, make music and dance together. For two days they rehearsed and then put together a magical performance that was filmed for American Public Television and recorded for Compass Records. Absolutely Irish is the product of this astonishingly brilliant, exuberant and joyful celebration of the very best of Irish music, song and dance.
