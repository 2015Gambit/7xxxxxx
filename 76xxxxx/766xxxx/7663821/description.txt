I'm planning on uploading a bunch of books that will lead to a correct understanding of morality and some specific moral issues. I'm heavily prioritizing books that I think will actually encourage people towards philanthropy. 

This is collection number 1

All uploads were made using neospeech bridget and there will be a few mistakes but overall I think you will agree that the quality is excellent.
