Anastasis: the Greek word for resurrection. Before you even press play, you've understood three things about Dead Can Dance's first album in 16 years: it's erudite, portentous in its introspection, and finds a band whose back catalogue is a kind of musical world tour swimming around in the Aegean sea.
If Anastasis marks a return to the past, itΓÇÖs more notable for marking the return of Dead Can Dance. Considering the bottomless well of territorial and spiritual inspiration the duo draw from, thereΓÇÖs no telling how far they could take this resurrection.

Dead Can Dance are:Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry
