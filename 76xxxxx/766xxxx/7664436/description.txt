Yes.... yes...! Blood Lines wasn't really popular at the time... but dang I remember playing hours on my Demo disc this game, it's a awesome game to play with your friend's, and now with the Internet, I could play the full version and enjoy my memories.

It was really a pain finding this game, and I like to play my PSX games on my PSP, so here it is, converted, added main theme music and CD cover at the boot.

Also to pump you up while you download, enjoy the menu music, really catchy! It's like finding a gem on youtube. ->

Eboot ready to play on your PSP, just copy-paste the folder in your GAME folder. You must have CFW and POPS loader. Have fun!
