documentary on Michael Crawford

Michael Crawford has starred in some of the biggest box-office hits of all time. From Frank Spencer in Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em, to the original Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, both in London's West End and on Broadway; from circus showman in Barnum to EFX, the multi-million extravaganza at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the biggest hotel in the world, which he dominated for over two years, playing Merlin, Houdini and H.G.Wells, and which broke all existing box office records. He is the only actor to have won an Olivier Award as 'Best Actor' at the same time as 'Best Actor in a Musical'. And then there was Hello Dolly with Barbara Streisand, The Knack, How I Won The War with John Lennon
