,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:22Z,You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files! More formats would be great! Especially the old proper xvid releases!
[V],meech,2012-09-23T01:46Z,no you should not (see above comment).  welcome to quality mr. butt_sex.
,EIIR,2012-09-23T01:57Z,"No one cares, BUTT_SEX. Sod off. Thanks, Dibya. "
,Green_Cheese_Kransky,2012-09-23T02:00Z,"It's funny you should say that BUTT_SEX. I go to DibyaTPB because they're the only user I trust who uploads an MKV file, which I watch on my tv through a media player. If you want an xvid video, there are plenty of others who upload them."
,Green_Cheese_Kransky,2012-09-23T02:01Z,"PS. Thanks Dibya, you never let me down and I appreciate it =)"
,lordquilton,2012-09-23T02:06Z,"Hey BUTT_SEX, seems like no-one (except you) gives a shit for weeks now. Instead of harassing people and making an arsehole of yourself, why don't you just convert it yourself. It's not rocket science.
Thanks Dibya, bigger IS better as far as I am concerned."
,EmoJoe1,2012-09-23T14:21Z,"Hi DibyaTPB love your torrents but can you make sure the [publichd] fits in the torrents name as I use rss to download all my files and this episode didn't download for me.
thanks"
,oldcrank,2012-09-23T20:54Z,"BUTT SEX made the same comment on eztv's version of this same episode. 

Why not search TPB for one of the many smaller versions? Many of us like the resolution which DibyaTPB and others provide out of the goodness of their hearts. 
Thanks again DibyaTPB."
