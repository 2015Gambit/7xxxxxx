Lyrics:

Let's Get It Started, in here...

And the base keep runnin' runnin',
and runnin', and runnin',
and runnin', and runnin',
and runnin', and runnin',
and runnin', and runnin',
and runnin', and runnin',
and runnin', and runnin',
and runnin', and runnin', and...

In this context, there's no disrespect,
so, when I bust my rhyme,
You break your necks.
We got five minutes for us to disconnect,
from all intellect collect the rhythm effect.
Obstacles are inefficient, follow
Your intuition, free your inner soul
And break away from tradition.
Coz when we beat out, girl it's pullin without.
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out.
Burn it till it's burned out.
Turn it till it's turned out.
Act up from north, west, east, south.

[Chorus:]
Everybody,(Come on)
Everybody, let's get into it.
Get stupid.(come on)
Get it started, get it started, get it started.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Yeah.

Lose control, of body and soul.
Don't move too fast, people,
Just take it slow.
Don't get ahead, just jump into it.
Ya'll here a body, two peices to it.
Get stutted, get stupid.
You'll want me body people
Will walk you through it.
Step by step, like you're into new kid.
Inch by inch with the new solution.
Trench men hits, with no delusion.
The feeling's irresistible
And that's how we movin'.

[Chorus:]
Everybody,(Come on)
Everybody, let's get into it.
Get stupid.(come on)
Get it started, get it started, get it started.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Let's get it started (ha),
let's get it started in here.
Yeah.
