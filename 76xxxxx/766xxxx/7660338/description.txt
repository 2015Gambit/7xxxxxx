QG 66 - Gravitational attraction

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The specific properties of Charge and Gravitation are compared directly to each other.

And clear definition of Gravitational ATTRACTION vs. Charge INTERACTION is developed.

The sixty-sixth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
