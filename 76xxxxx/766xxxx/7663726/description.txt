"2/18/71 seems to garner all the accolades from the '71 Port Chester run, but this performance deserves recognition in its own right. Although the vibe is quite laid back (the band might be hungover), it's a very well played show, and includes some dynamite jamming. Jerry's guitar sounds amazing in the mix. You can hear every line, and he's rippin it."
