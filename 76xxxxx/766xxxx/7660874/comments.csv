,Bonesman1990,2012-09-26T08:28Z,"John 3:16 - ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""

Time is short, heathens! Accept the Lord as your Saviour or the Crusaders' blades will taste your flesh once and for all.

HIS will be done! "
,SystemFolder,2012-09-27T21:08Z,"The bible is so full of advice on everything that a bible quote can be used for nearly any occasion. For example: Let's say I have a brother, well used to have a brother, and I have a thing for his widow. I could use the below bible passage to try to convince her to have sex with me. I could also use the story of the sin of Onan, since the sin of Onan was NOT about masturbation but rather about god commanding a dude to get his brother's widow pregnant.

""Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."" (Mark 12:19)"

,raenkae,2012-09-30T19:03Z,"RIZIJAN: Now I dont condone actions like that of otbros. But your attitude is condescending and seem to claim to knowledge about the other person. Did YOU know your ancestors? Maybe from the proud zoroastrian Sassanid empire, with its magnificent library of the capital Ctesiphon, all books where burned because the murderous thugs in the form of fanatical islamists deemed them as ""herecy""!

I tell you sir! That Islam is in my view an terrible legacy of an deranged madman which still poisons every negotiations about peace in the middle east today.

Just this notion that the quran is the unaltered words of the god Allah. I tell you that NOTHING is left that originates from Muhammed. So nobody can actually say what Muhammed said. Much less what the hebrew archangel Gabriel/Jibreel should have said as Muhammed was clearly following HIS OWN AGENDA, of what we can derive from the surviving scriptures.

Just madmen follow such claims. And as there are so many muslims in the world, there is the proof that humanity is truly foolish.

EVIDENCE and TRUTH is something EVERYBODY should hold as sacred. EVERY MAN! Otherwise we all deserve the coming doom, as we were too much of a fool to stop bickering about legends and myths!"
,SystemFolder,2012-09-30T19:41Z,"I have to concur with Raenkae. While I do not necessarily agree with Otbros views, I will fight to my last breath for his right to express them. Just like I would do for anyone who is being denied free speech for any reason. Information should be free, even information with which you disagree."
