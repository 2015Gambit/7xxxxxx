I found out that Clifton was actually out in english from the small publisher Cinebook, a company that specialize in releasing euro comics in english.

Clifton is a Franco-Belgian comics series in the humorous spy-genre, featuring the exploits of Colonel Sir Harold Wilberforce Clifton. It was created by Raymond Macherot in 1959, and has since passed on to various artists and scenarists. Over the fifty years of publication of Clifton comic books, approximately 20 full books and 20 smaller stories have been published, totalling about 800 pages.

Clifton is a British colonel, retired from MI5, though sometimes still active for the British government, Clifton functions as an amateur sleuth, and his phlegmatic approach to stress leads to humorous situations. Harold Clifton lives in Puddington, near London, supported by housekeeper Mrs Partridge, who makes a prize-winning goulash. Clifton drives a red MG TD from the early fifties, which gets mangled in most stories, but is repaired regardless of cost. Cliftons hobbies include Boy Scouting (hes Boy Scoutmaster Singing Heron), cats, and collecting cigar wraps. He received a Knighthood in 1993 for saving a member of the Royal family.

So here you have Clifton 1-6, from Cinebook. This book is all ages friendly, so can safely give it to your kids, even if you are american :)
