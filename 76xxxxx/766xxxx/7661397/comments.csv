I added the 4 audio languages that were included in the 2003 DVD edition, as well as the 13 subtitles (+Greek not listed above). This was pretty much of a lot of work but I managed to do it right so enjoy and please seed forever you punks haha!
Added the cover scans too, but only 3 extracts from the Repo Code booklet."
