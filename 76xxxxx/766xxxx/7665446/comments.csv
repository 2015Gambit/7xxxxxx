Perfectly watchable at 200% size, compression isn't a problem at all. Full screen obviously you can see compression artifacts. Considering how old this is and how small files are quality is excellent. 
I grew up watching this show, even now it's still one of the best I've ever seen. First season was by far the best. It's with this show that I've discovered Kevin Spacey, you could already see how amazing he is.
Thanks a lot :)"
