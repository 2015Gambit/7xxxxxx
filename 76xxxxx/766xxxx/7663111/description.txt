QG 67 - Gravitation & Relativity

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The Energy pressure gradients of General Relativity and its tensors are investigated and clarified in terms of Tetryonic charged geometries revealing the role of SR in EinsteinΓÇÖs theory of General relativity.

The sixty-seventh chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter in motion, it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
