Ricky, Julian and Bubbles are about to get out of jail,
and this time, Julian vows to go straight, even open a
legit business. Soon the Boys will all be rich. At least
thats what theyve told the parole board. But when they
arrive back at the park, they find it's not the same old
Sunnyvale - and it's not the same old Jim Lahey, Trailer
Park Supervisor. Lahey's a new man, hasn't had a drink
for two years. And he has plans - BIG PLANS - for Sunnyvale.
But unfortunately for Lahey, Julian stands in his way. With
his big plans for Sunnyvale going down the toilet, his
relationship with Randy broken down, and having the Boys back
in the park is all way too much pressure for him to bear.
For Jim Lahey, the countdown to liquor day is on. Meanwhile,
Julian's having problems of his own and the Boys are forced
to resort to doing what they know best - breaking the law.
Lahey's descent into the liquor coupled with the Boys descent
into crime puts them all on a collision course to mayhem and
destruction.
