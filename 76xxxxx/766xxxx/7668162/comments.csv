,tibird,2012-09-24T21:49Z,yeah I seeded to 4.457 ratio cheers :)
,tibird,2012-09-24T21:59Z,after checking around there arent any other torrents i'm interested in I decided to seed it again. Its a very good show and if I knew how to rip shows i'd do torrents myself. but it sounds complicated so i'll stick to seeding your torrents lol. since it already deleted the torrent info I have to down it again to seed it. this time i'll prolly seed it over night to who knows maybe a 10 ratio or so.
