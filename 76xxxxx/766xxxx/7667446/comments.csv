,brnblnk,2012-09-26T05:29Z,Is it really so hard to put something up in FLAC format? Seriously.
,B0kk1e,2012-09-26T16:41Z,"Not sure if you know tgat ISO format may contain only one track, so it's useless t create an ISO image unless there is only one audio track on the disk.

The reason why the CD is converted to CUE/IMG format is because this way you can mount it and burn as audio disc, convert it to FLAC, APE, OGG or MP3 - just choose your preferred option. 

If you mount the image, you could also get all track information directly from CDDB, freeDb, etc."
