This is a collection of music videos from the 1960's that I've found over the years.  Most are B&W clips from British TV, and the rest are color from who knows where.

Brian Poole and the Tremeloes
The Byrds - All I Really Want
Fleetwood Mac - Oh! Well
Jefferson Airplane - 2 clips - Crown of Creation & Eskimo Blue Day
Rolling Stones - 3 clips - Get Off My Cloud, Let's Spend The Night Together, Jumpin' Jack Flash
The Kinks - 2 B&W clips - Got Love If You Want It, You Really Got Me
The Pretty Things on Film - promo film for 1966 EP 
The Pretty Things - Midnight to Six Man
The Who - 2 B&W clips - My Generation, So Sad About Us
Tom Jones - 2 B&W clips - Delilah, What I Say
Led Zeppelin - Communication Breakdown, Dazed and Confused - Kick-ass color appearance on French TV.  Check out the audience reaction shots - the kid with his fingers in his ears is priceless!

Please seed this as long as possible to keep this historical record alive for future generations.
