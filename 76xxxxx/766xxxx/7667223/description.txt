"Captive, Even Choice Is Not an Option" was a film directed by Brillante Ma Mendoza which is an adaptation of the Dos Palmas incident which is the kidnapping of two US missionaries by the Abu Sayyaf Group that happened in 2001. The film was starred by Isabel Huppert, a French actress who has appeared in different movies, she plays the role of Therese Burgoine, a French national and a volunteer social worker for a non-government organization based in Palawan. The film is quite intriguing because the story is like a documentation of what had happened in the Dos Palmas incident, though, 25 percent of the film consists of fictitious characters and places.
