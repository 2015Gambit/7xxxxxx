Gondwanaland's second album, Let the Dog Out contains a bracket of aggressive, up-tempo numbers followed by two extended compositions, the first of which, "Ephemeral Lakes", later became a regular choice for meditative ambient music compilations.
Gondwanaland's second album, and the last to remain instrumental (core musician Charlie McMahon added vocals to his didgeridoo playing on the subsequent Gondwanaland album), this 1986 release evoces the vastness and aglessness of the pre-historic island continent from which the band takes its name.
