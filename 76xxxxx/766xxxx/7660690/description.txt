NOTE: I do not have constant normal Internet access like all of you.  I steal it from a random neighbor, but for some reason, they choose to turn their router off or something along those lines, so most days I only have a few hours of Internet, sometime less.  So, this will be a slow upload, and may take a week or even more, depending on how much Internet I have, so please be patient.
