The Ed Show; September 21, 2012.

Mitt Romney releases his 2011 tax return, which raised more questions than answers and may even disqualify him from being president!

Ed reviewed Romney's weak from hell with Ari Melber (Correspondent for The Nation), and former Governor Ted Strickland (D-OH).

Ed had a full analysis of Romney's sketchy tax returns with David Cay Johnston (columnist for Reuters, Pulitzer Prize winner, author of "Perfectly Legal" and "Free Lunch").

Then, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) joined Ed to review Paul Ryan's attempt to fool seniors at the AARP convention.

And in the Big Finish, Todd Akin was forced to answer for his "legitimate rape" remarks for the first time, at a debate with Claire McCaskill.  John Nichols (Washington Correspondent of The Nation), will report on that.
