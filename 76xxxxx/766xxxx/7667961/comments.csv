http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7628589/BATMAN___00"
,riwcio,2012-09-24T19:37Z,great stuff anyway ;)
,AquaticLightning,2012-09-25T00:19Z,"You are amazing. I was about to give up on finding the 12th issue and thought, ""Hey, why not check mirrormaster's profile one last time?"" And behold! You had them all! If it weren't for you I never would've been able to read comics (Never knew they were on TPB). I really can't tell you how grateful I am. Thankyou so much! "
,KeijiMusashi,2012-09-25T05:39Z,Finally someone uploads the new 52 Batman!  Thanks a lot. Been wanting to read this.  Will you be uploading each new issue monthly?  Would greatly appreciate it.
,b4zem,2012-09-25T14:42Z,"Cheers man you work fast!
much appreciated"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-09-25T19:20Z,"AquaticLightning: I have uploaded every single issue of Batman so I don't know how you couldn't find it.
KeijiMusashi:Since I'm uploading it regularly of course I will."
,riwcio,2012-09-25T21:13Z,"mirrormaster, you know you are our hero, right? ;)"
,AquaticLightning,2012-09-26T03:48Z,"I mean, unless some are hidden I had a really hard time finding them all because a few were missing from your profile's uploads. I went through all your pages too. "
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-09-26T17:33Z,"AquaticLightning:Just choose category other,type batman and you find issue 12 on the 2nd page...I mean it doesn't really matter now but check it out."
,AquaticLightning,2012-09-27T01:53Z,Thanks man. I'm actually very new to The Pirate Bay so I was having some trouble. 
,alejandro70pb,2012-10-01T02:10Z,GRACIAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
