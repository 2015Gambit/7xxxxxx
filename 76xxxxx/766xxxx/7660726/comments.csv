,bob9001a,2012-09-22T12:40Z,"""to dump"", titanuse? learn proper English you fucking moron."
,titanuse,2012-09-22T13:50Z,"I really don't care what you think of my English, bob9001a, since it's not the languge i was born to use.

If you don't like rars, then don't dll. If you don't like sceneline, then don't dll. In fact, why don't you upload some nice stuff, and don't rar it?

I for one would rather say thanks scenline, both for this upload, and all the others you push to TPB. So thanks!"

,Da5niper,2012-09-23T06:09Z,"@titanuse: The problem with RAR'ed movie files is that they often are locked with a password, and they use a scam for you to fill survery in order to get the password.  You really should distribute the MKV file straight! No need to have 30some files! :)"
