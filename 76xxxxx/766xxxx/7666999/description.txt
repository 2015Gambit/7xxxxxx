Everyman Studios Mini-Comics.

Thus far, these were the most difficult and time consuming books I've 'Restored'. Do to the fact that they are of a smaller size to begin with, and the paper they were originally printed on was SOOO thin, I literally had to go through them ONE PAGE at a time. No batch applications of the 'Restoration' changes on these. In fact, by the time I was done I had actually discovered several new settings, or combinations of settings, to use on these 'Restoration' projects.

Since they were a smaller book to begin with, I haven't enlarged the images quite as much as my usual 'Restorations', either. You will STILL need to click down the size 2 or 3 notches to get the most out of the work done to these books.

Some of these are quite interesting, or strange, or beautifully drawn, or just nice pieces of art that very few people would ever have seen if not for the efforts of the original collectors and scanners. I did skip one, called 'Samyang Ramyon', because I just couldn't find any 'Restoration' settings that worked and it wasn't very interesting or fun to look at to begin with.
