I'm going to keep this short.

I'm a Beatles fan and a Big Time Rush fan. When I tell people that I liked this movie, they gasp, thinking I've lost my mind. But, I haven't. If you go back in time and watch the Beatles' movie "Help!", you will find similar gags and stupidities. This movie is enjoyable, harmless, and full of good music. I find their song covers to be quite refreshing. The kept all of the familiar elements of the songs while modernizing them. After watching this movie I downloaded the soundtrack. They do just as well as the cast of "Across the Universe". Nobody will ever be as good as The Beatles, even BTR admitted this. I applaud Big Time Rush for doing what most do not dare try.
