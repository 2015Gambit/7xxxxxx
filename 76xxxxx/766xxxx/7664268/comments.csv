,moxxon,2012-09-24T07:47Z,the audio's bad in this one.
,Oblivilot,2012-09-24T11:13Z,"The audio is fine. I previously watched a much larger file size version of this, watching this version now. Audio is fine, sync is fine. Using VLC."
,Oblivilot,2012-09-24T11:17Z,"Oops. My bad. Thought I was commenting on the 1080p YIFY version. The audio is definitely messed up on the 720p version! For comparison, here is a different (1.03G) 720p source which sounds fine:

,Oblivilot,2012-09-24T11:22Z,"Delete / Nuke this torrent. It needs to be re-encoded, the audio is HORRIBLE. *However* the 1080p YIFY of the movie seems ok. Others claim sync issues on the 1080p."
,Xorakka,2012-09-24T13:39Z,"Confirming HORRIBLE Audio. Sorry YIFY.

V=9
A=4
M=10

Download the 1080p version."
,leelee421,2012-09-24T14:18Z,What the F* is wrong with the Audio! 
,Oblivilot,2012-09-24T16:25Z,"YIFY - Please Delete/Nuke this version and re-do : the audio is  total garbage. I tested it on an iPad also, and can 100% confirm, there are major problems with the audio."
,dragonballz,2012-09-24T19:19Z,One in 20movies you release have awesome plot and that one movie is corrupted. damn luck.
,deepak_rokz,2012-09-24T20:58Z,"Thnx a TON!!
ur the top uploader..."
,Symn,2012-09-24T21:30Z,urgh.... horrible audio! Bummer...
,schnitzelburger,2012-09-26T09:44Z,"As always, horrible picture quality. YIFY sucks. Waste of space. Just pixel mush. You get better quality if you encode at 480P at this file size. But because YIFY doesn't have any clue about video encoding, he keeps uploading crap. And he gets worshipped by idiots who think it's good quality, just because they watch it on their tiny computer screen where they don't see that it's all blurry pixel shit. Folks, get some glasses! Idiots."
,Wicky_be,2012-09-27T08:37Z,"@schnitzelburger: video quality is okay - I'm watching this on a 46"" from a distance of 8'.  Not V10 but V8 for sure.  Audio doesn't seem right in this one, only A5."
,Chased911,2012-09-29T03:25Z,What's up with YIFY's audio quality lately? Very low!!!
,-G-rad,2012-10-04T09:59Z,Audio very disappointing - unlike usual YIFY stuff... But quite good film - I'm downloading 1.4GB version :-)
