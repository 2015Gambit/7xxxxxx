,chicoZ24,2012-09-27T20:52Z,"works great, running on lt 3.0 and burned with imgburn."
,DeAnima,2012-09-27T23:07Z,"Is anyone else getting ""Invalid Address For Write"" errors when burning this?  I have tried twice- with Verbatims 003's iHas burner, ImgBurn, all of of that-  and I get failures at around the 50% mark both times.  I even tried re-downloading the ISO just in case.
   I have burned over 50 discs with my current setup and no problems, and others are commenting on successful burns here, so I am not quite sure what my problem could be.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance."
