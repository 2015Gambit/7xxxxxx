,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-22T21:24Z,First to upload! Great job! Can we get one in xvid too please?
,kaisuininjin,2012-09-22T22:19Z,Thanks! You're awesome :^)

Just do it yourself BUTT_SEX."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-22T22:42Z,"@tracie535: No! Why would I do it myself when there is always the proper avi/xvid encoded rip to be downloaded? I'm not just speaking for myself here, but all the others that prefer watching it on their dvd/bluray player or ps3! If you haven't noticed just about all the movies on here are xvid! I'm not repeating the same crap I do every week so I'll just stop there.."
,trace535,2012-09-22T23:10Z,"BUTT_SEX, you are not making any sense. If groups like TvTeam or EZTV want to release something, they will, but if they don't want to, they won't.

Do you really think they give a shit about your repeated requests?"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T00:00Z,"@tracie535: I'm not the only one out there that prefers xvid releases. I'd say I'm the majority. I used to never post comments until lately, there are a lot out there that probably don't want to make an account to post.

And you're not making any sense then with that logic. Do you think I really give a shit what you have to say in your repeated replies? 

I guess if you are going to continue to respond, at least tell me which method you use to watch Doctor Who. I don't see why anyone would prefer to watch it with a computer when there are more convenient options available with xvid. Yes. sure I could convert it like you said. But a lot of people don't have the skills to do so. You would be surprised, lol. It's just better for everyone to have more options/formats available! It makes no sense for Doctor Who to be available in ONLY x264 when most of the video uploads are in xvid. Then when a group of uploaders all upload the same exact format, why? Lol.. It makes more sense to have some xvid releases out there. That's how it has always been.

,OccamsRayzor,2012-09-23T00:54Z,"BUTT_SEX, why don't you just fuck off?  TPB doesn't have anything to do with the upload or creation of these videos, so you're posting your drivel in the wrong place, you fucking moronic troll.
Sheesh, I've seen some whiny arse little bitches in my time but you take the prize."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:08Z,"@OccamsRayzor: First off, I'm sure you also use this name while you are role playing dungeons and dragons or whatever.. But where the fuck did I say anything about TPB making these files? Can't you fucking read? 

That being said, I find it funny none of you fucking retards coming on here to argue with me have even made any comments about the quality of the file. 

So I'll be the first..

V-8
A-8

And I'd give the episode an 8 too. Just wish it was a two parter, was curious to see where it could have gone. Especially with you know who's daughter and the alien race/bad guys. (Trying to avoid spoilers here.)"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:18Z,"Oh and before anyone has anything more to say, I think you should refer to a previous discussion a lot of us had a couple weeks ago regarding the same topic. Here is the link, for your convenience.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7613715/Doctor_Who_2005_7x02_Dinosaurs_On_A_Spaceship_HDTV_x264-FoV_[ezt

The comments here were pretty interesting. "
,trace535,2012-09-23T02:21Z,"First of all, there is no need for anyone to ""comment on the quality of the file"" since reputable users like TvTeam do not upload crap, especially when it comes to HD television, for which the scene has very stringent standards. This is not a DVD or Blu-ray rip!

Second, it takes no skill at all to convert video, numbnuts. Here's the formula: take your target file size in kilobytes (eg. 350 MB x 1024 = 358400 KB) and substract the audio bitrate times the running time (eg. 128 kbps x 44 min), then divide the remaining quantity by the running time again, to obtain the video bitrate. Then use any free program (like Pazera) which is just a GUI for an ffmpeg implementation, to re-encode the video with Xvid 1.2.2 at the chosen bitrate.

Or alternatively you can just connect your fucking television to a PC to play the x264 file."
,Coffee_is_Good,2012-09-23T02:28Z,"@BUTT_SEX:

There's this thing called Any Video Converter.  Try it out instead of just bitching about the formats that people decide to use.

Remember, you're getting this shit for FREE on top of it being illegal.  The people who upload these shows do so at their risk, not yours.  You'd do well to stifle the complaints on the video format.

And really, if you're that pressed to watch it on a TV, then get a fucking HDMI or VGA cable and hook your laptop up to the Television.

That, or do like the rest of us and just watch it on your computer with headphones/speakers.

Either way, quit the bitching.  Fuck, I registered on here just to tell you that!"
