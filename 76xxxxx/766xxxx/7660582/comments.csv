,wearehidden,2012-09-22T09:52Z,"its  a good collection its way to large to list, it is 2.2gb total of pdf's "
,wearehidden,2012-09-22T09:53Z,"but i think everyone will be very happy with the collection at large, it covers just about everything"
,jabba50,2012-09-22T10:51Z,Thanks a lot for posting. Happy to DL all.
,faggot1999,2012-09-22T11:36Z,"Because of faggots like the uploader, I had to write a Python script which rejects books I already have.

You know how many books I get out of a collection like this, on average?

1 or 2.

Which means about 10-20MiB.

Don't rar it next time, and by bittorrent client will be able to list the contents, even you are too gay to do so."
,wearehidden,2012-09-22T12:35Z,im sorry for zipping the collection i added an unzipped torrent here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7661474
,shamanist,2012-09-23T07:59Z,"Damn, but faggot 1999 must be off his meds or experiencing some sort of 'download rage'... wearehidden provided an unzipped version for your whining ass... the least you could do is come back and say 'thank you!"" Personally, Idownload large collections like this and then unzip them and then run a program to check them against a masterlist to keep the ones I don't have and dump the rest. It is so simple, even a crybaby like yourself could do it. Maybe you want wearehidden to stop by and cut your food up for you..."
,shamanist,2012-09-23T08:03Z,"By the way, wearehidden, thanks for providing both a compressed and uncompressed version of your upload. To help out the children in the audience, you might want to make a compressed files and a text file listing the contents in the future. It might keep you from the abuse some people think substitutes for social skills. Good luck with future uploads..."
,wearehidden,2012-09-23T10:20Z,"thanks for the advice, i was reluctant to list EVERYTHING since theres well over 200 books :/

and i will continue to share what i got thanks for the kind words.

hope you guys enjoy my collection"
