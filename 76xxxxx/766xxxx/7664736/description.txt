The Revolutionary Hymns~2-CD (ITM) [FLAC] {MKOP}

''Jazz was created in America. Not through any great educational force, but from the Souls of people who were brought here under protest'' (Dizzy Gillepsie)

"Just as there is the Frech writer, the Jewish writer, the Russian writer, the African writer, or African-American writer. Black poets have discovered their uniqueness, their beauty, their tales, their history and have diligently moved to enlighten their people and the world's people in an art form that's called poetry, but to them is another extension of black music'' (LeRoi Jones, 1968)
