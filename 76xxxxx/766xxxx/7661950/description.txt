Special thanks to Artie (and his friend Nicky) for taping. Thanks to our friend "M" for the 2nd gen.

Here's the story in regards to why this show is incomplete. Two 120 minutes tapes were brought to record this show. One was with the recorder (which was w/Nicky-Artie's friend for the majority of the show) and one with Artie who ended up near the stage wearing a t-shirt that said "staff" or "security". Security discovered this and
bringing Artie back to the security office. Artie had the other 120 minute tape on him.
The band:

Robert Plant-Vocals
Jimmy Page-Guitar
John Bonham-Drums
John Paul Jones-Bass, Mandolin, Organ
