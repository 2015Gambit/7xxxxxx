I was on an old  dashboard on the 360 and realized I needed to update to the newest one in order for this game to work.

For those of you who do not know..... DON'T update from the game disk!.... 

Instead go to xbox.com and download it and open it on to a usb stick then insert the stick in the 360 and boot it up agree to all.....finaly reboot and allow file to transfer it will error before your done with a flashing light on the front of the box but it's supposed to...Then turn it off remove the usb stick and reboot. Your done and playing Angry Birds."
