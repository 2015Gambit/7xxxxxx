KDE-specific features:
- Akonadi/Virtuoso/Nepomuk: removed from startup and demon disabled
- Andromeda replaces Dolphin/rekonq/konqueror
- LXterminal replaces Konsole
- Kate replaces geany
- KMix is default sound mixer
- Network-manager as icon in panel
- Joy Blue theme



Changes:
- removed Pidgin (size), Sylpheed (inconsistent appearance) and Ranger (redundant in KDE)
- radiotray: added radio channels for the Netherlands and Belgium

configuration files
- bashrc and bash_aliases reworked and available for root
- $USER/bin contains scripts and README
- 800+ channels in Radiotray
- Kmenu entries for CLI apps

known bugs:
- Andromeda occasionally does not render sites with Javascript
- minor: lxterminal opens in ~/Documents folder. Easy fix: right-click the lxterminal icon -> Icon Settings -> Application tab -> change the work path to where you want it to start (typically /homeUSER/)
- ridiculous: the icons in the task bar are [file manager] [terminal] [menu] and not vice versa -- no idea how this happened :D
