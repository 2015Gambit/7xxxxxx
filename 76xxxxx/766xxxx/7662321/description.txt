        Release Notes:

        The other release contains skips on track 10 beginning around 5:00.
        Though not a valid proper reason, there are also typos on tracks 02, 05
        and 08, which is tagged "Take Care Of The Properwork." Well then, don't
        mind if I do! Here's a (Proper) release that's ripped in secure mode
        done by an actual fan of deadmau5. Major props on E-Zoo this year!
