[V],twentyforty,2012-09-24T08:14Z,"I would send you Invite. And no, unfortunately I am unable to do Fringe again. It's gone (everyone knows why and when) and I currently cannot have enough HDD space to get probably 1 Terabyte sources of old Fringe episodes and upload/seed abilities to seed it almost indefinitely long, because TPB turned into download, not sharing place (due to 99.98% Hit&Run).

But - for a fact - I know how Fringe exists in many shapes all over Internet. You just need to find it."
,stevesquirtle,2012-09-24T10:42Z,"no problem twentyforty :)) ,, how about heroes season 1 to 4? and i m amazed on how can u upload tv series in such small sizes ,,, thanks :))"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-24T16:23Z,"Heroes were my regular, from episode one. However, it was years ago and they are gone too."
,stevesquirtle,2012-09-25T11:03Z,"how bout touch season 1? from what i read ,,tim kring the one who created heroes is also the one doing the touch :)) ,, 480p quality would be ok :)) i prefer smaller sizes without affecting the quality like ur uploads :))"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-25T15:00Z,"Touch was my regular show. However, it turns out to be pathetic (Pilot ep. gave false hope) and I announced how I wont pick season 2.
Season 1.eps are on SU but I would try to make season pack and upload it here, soon (with two weeks old last episode of season one)."
