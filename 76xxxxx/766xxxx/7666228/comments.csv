Warning - Usually, books written by non-academics  who improvise on explaining history and resort to catastrophes to explain events, turn out to be catastrophic in the sense that they fail to convince anybody with some higher education and therefore, know better...

,odyssey09,2012-10-03T21:34Z,"An intriguing piece of work, I think there was a UK Channel 4 documentary to accompany the book... The amount of research done by the author tying together the global situation in 6th century is impressive... It's clear something went awry at the time and even if you dont agree with the book's conclusions it's a fascinating journey.

So what if the author doesn't have PHds after his name? Maybe this book will inspire some of them to do some work read by more than 10 people and explain what actually happened..."
