What are those .idx files?  This naming convention is different than your normal uploads."
,ani12,2012-09-24T04:34Z,"@funpigj2k: idx n sub work together to give u the perfect subtitles... do not delete the idx files or d subtitles wont play.. this series doesn't hav proper in-sync subs, so i'm guessing @twentyforty put it together for us.."
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-24T08:28Z,"Yes. .idx/.sub works in pairs. IDX is Index (When,Why,How, etc) and SUB is actual multi language (here on SEVEN languages) capable subtitle as on disks.
They can be converted to one-language .srt with VobSub's SubResync (Save as...).

And NO,  it is not unusual. I don't like them because they are too big, much bigger than single language .srt txt file.   "
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-24T08:36Z,Beside what has been said - it was Lost&found really old encode survived only because I gave it away way back. Now; I found it and re-uploaded (first torrent was deleted by me because of pile of shitty comments).
,funpigj2k,2012-09-24T15:42Z,"Well, no matter.  Thanks for the upload!
