Aung San Suu Kyi: The Choice

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Gina McKee, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC This World series in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Documentary which captures the moment when the Nobel Prize-winning dissident Aung San Suu Kyi took the huge, risky step into everyday politics in Burma. This tells Suu Kyi's extraordinary personal and political story, how she turned from Oxford housewife into national leader and then international icon of resistance.

Filmed over a year of tumultuous change in Burma, the film has two long interviews with Suu Kyi, with her colleagues in Burma and with her family and friends outside. Hillary Clinton describes the impact of meeting this woman, who she had long admired, as 'seeing a long lost friend', yet comparing her to Nelson Mandela.

Suu Kyi talks of sadness but no regrets over the decision she took, while her colleagues outline clearly the ongoing gamble that they are all taking in compromising with the regime. Made over an extended period, the film uses a range of extraordinary unseen archive - not least the moment she meets her husband and son for the first time after five years.
