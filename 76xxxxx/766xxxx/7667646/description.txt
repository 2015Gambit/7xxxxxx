I am one of those who deny the existence of Italian cinema (except for Rossellini and Antonioni). So my surprise was all the greater, literally shocking, when I saw Fille d’Amour [the French title of Traviata ‘53], which the specialists of all things Italian (even admitting their concern about it) did not even seem to consider. Fille d’Amour, subtitled, and I do not understand the reason why, Traviata ’53, is a modern adaptation of La Dame aux Camélias, and I can only add that: 1) there is no drop in taste, if anything the contrary 2) the sordid and pessimism play no part 3) for the first time Barbara Laage acts, that is, she moves and is moving, laughs, cries and skips 4) the director Vittorio Cottafavi, of whose work we in Paris have only been able to see Milady et les mousquetaires (Il boia di Lilla), has done a more than admirable job and his Fille d’amour instantly reminded me of Cronaca di un amore. Italian productions – more invasive every day – are preparing us for – and America as well – unexpected pleasant surprises in the thankless but prestigious field of secondary films. Or so we hope. ~ Robert Lachenay [François Truffaut], Fille d’amour. La signora aux camélias, “Cahiers du cinéma”, n. 36, June 1954
