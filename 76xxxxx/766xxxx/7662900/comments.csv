,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:11Z,You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files! More formats would be great! Especially the old proper xvid releases!
,Taurich,2012-09-23T05:05Z,"BUTT_SEX. it's time to move on. xVid/divX has been outdated for 4 years. If you decide you need to watch your shows on an almost 10 years old piece of equipment like a PS3, then it's up to you to reencode the files yourself.
Go download Any Video Converter. It's free and will convert x264 .mkv files into xVid .mp4 that will play on your sony."
