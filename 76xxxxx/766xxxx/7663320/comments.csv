,Carjacker,2012-09-23T02:03Z,"Witchblade is an American television series that aired on TNT from 2001 to 2002. 
The series is based on the Witchblade comic book series, and followed a pilot 
film which debuted in August 2000. Some of the episodes were written by Ralph 
Hemecker, Marc Silvestri (who also wrote the comic book) and J.D. Zeik.

Yancy Butler starred as Sara Pezzini, Anthony Cistaro as Kenneth Irons, David 
Chokachi as Jake McCartey, Eric Etebari as Ian Nottingham, Will Yun Lee as Danny 
Woo, Conrad Dunn as Tommy Gallo, Kenneth Welsh as Joe Siri, and John Hensley as 
Gabriel Bowman, among others. Although critically acclaimed and popular with 
audiences,[citation needed] the show was canceled in September 2002; there was 
speculation that the cancellation was connected to Butler's entering rehab for 
alcoholism.[1]

The series ran for two seasons on TNT, for a total of 24 episodes (including 
pilot). The first episode aired June 12, 2001; the last episode aired August 26, 
2002. In spite of its cancellation, Witchblade was ranked seventh in the Top 10 
Basic Cable Dramas for 2002 (Multichannel News, February 24, 2003).
