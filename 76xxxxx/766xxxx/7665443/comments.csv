,susulock,2012-09-23T20:06Z,"@Dem047 I agree. I had to remove and reinstall the whole game because I installed the previous update. And then I just gave up. Should I install this one? And if yes, will this one work without the previous update??"
,shauwy,2012-09-23T20:48Z,"You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this
update is featuring all previous updated content.
