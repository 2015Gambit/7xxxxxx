Included in this torrent are a collection of tech tools that would be useful when troubleshooting issues. And lets face it, we all know it happens sooner or later. These programs i chose have descriptions on each folder letting you know their purpose. They are shareware and i have also posted a link in the read me's to download the latest versions. 

If you know of better tools or packages then i'm all ears.

Tools:
A Disaster DVD Bootable With LOTS of tools. Boots to  Win XP
Blue Screen Crash Info

I really would like some feed back on these if you guys don't mind. Thanks.

Enjoy.
