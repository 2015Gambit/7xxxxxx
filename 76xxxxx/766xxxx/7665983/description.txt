For example, there's an open C chord...
Moving up the neck, we have a C chord based on an open A shape.
Extending from that is a C chord based on an open G shape.
Connecting to this is an 8th fret C chord based on an E shape...
which connects to a C chord based on an open D chord shape.
All together, we have a CAGED C Chord... Voila! C-A-G-E-D!
RHYTHM GUITAR AND CHORD PROGRESSIONS
Knowing these different chord positions will allow you to be more flexible and create many different voicings, rather than just playing the same group of chords. Take a simple 2-chord progression, like G to C. You can then easily spice things up by moving to higher or lower chord positionsΓÇö yet you are still playing the same 2 chords, G to C. It's as simple as that.
LEAD GUITAR
For each chord position, you will also learn scale positions, which you can use to create lead fills as well as lead guitar solos.
By the end of this course you will have CAGED major, minor and 7th chords, along with major and minor pentatonic and diatonic scales. In other words, you will have a very thorough understanding of the entire fretboard!
BONUS FEATURES: Easy-to-read, on-screen sheet music. Printable PDFs of the MJS CAGED Method in every key! Includes "EASY CHEAT" chords for beginners!
