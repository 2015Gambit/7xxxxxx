QG 69 ΓÇô Gravito~Electro~Magnetic fields

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The development of a quantum field theory explaining the mechanics of Gravitation.

Explaining the role of Gravity and ElectroMagnetic fields in creating the nett observable force of Gravity and revealing the [K]EM interactions of Matter as contributors to the gravitational field.

The sixty-ninth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
