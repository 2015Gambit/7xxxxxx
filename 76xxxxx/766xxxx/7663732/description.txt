For thirty years, Peter Singer's Practical Ethics has been the classic introduction to applied ethics. Other questions confront us as concerned citizens: equality and discrimination on the grounds of race or sex; abortion, the use of embryos for research, and euthanasia; political violence and terrorism; and the preservation of our planet's environment. This book's lucid style and provocative arguments make it an ideal text for university courses and for anyone willing to think about how she or he ought to live.


I created this with the text to speech voice neospeech bridget and though it is a high quality voice there will be a few pronunciation problems. 

Enjoy and let me know what you think :)
