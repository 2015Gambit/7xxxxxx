,Big.Indian,2012-09-24T21:55Z,"I'll be happy to seed it once you do...

Everybody seems stuck @ 5.2% right now."
,Big.Indian,2012-09-24T21:57Z,"I think my comment should have been posted on your OTHER BB10 torrent.

Are you seeding both of these, or have you abandoned one?"
,missivy666,2012-09-24T22:43Z,"Common people, SEED!"
,missivy666,2012-09-24T22:44Z,Did you drop it? :(
,bc0730,2012-09-25T00:16Z,"I abandoned the original one which was not the US season because it was faulty.  I did have to shut down my seeding for awhile because it was affecting my ability to download a final episode to get season 12 uploaded, I apologize, all should be good now!!!"
,bc0730,2012-09-25T00:19Z,"It should be uploading very well now, I have given it all the power I can, high bandwidth and unlimited upload/download speed.  Again, sorry about having to stop it earlier."
,bc0730,2012-09-25T00:26Z,"Apparently my earlier comment explaining was erased so again, I had shut down earlier because I was having issues with downloading an episode to finish out and upload full season 12 but up and running again and at high bandwidth/unlimited upload/download speed so it should work much better.  Sorry about the issues."
,sykoskit,2012-09-25T08:27Z,"hey bc0730 thanks for the upload i appreciate the effort... just so you know, episode 10 is missing, and episode 11 you have labeled as both ep 10 and 11... idk if you have episode 10, or if you know where i can get it, but i was in the middle of watching the season lol"
,bc0730,2012-09-25T18:04Z,"I have uploaded the REAL episode 10 to go with this season, please download it and seed it so it can be watched when you come to the error which was just brought to my attention.  Posting that individual episode is probably the best fix rather than reposting a whole new season that everyone would then have to redownload.  I apologize for the mix up, now I know who I can trust as far as getting the pieces I put together to get the whole seasons."
,sykoskit,2012-09-25T19:08Z,"thanks man ya i deleted the old one and downloaded this one in less than an hour, i started it before i commented, but i was trying to watch episode 10 and it's still episode 11.. idk if you changed it since i started this download before my comment, or if you were going to post a new torrent for that file, either way is ok with me, i actually found the episode on youtube, so enthralled in the season i couldn't wait even for this torrent to dl, lol. anyways, hope i could help, and again, i truly appreciate the effort. i had seasons 1-8 and did NOT want to dl the 93gb torrent w seasons 1-11 even just for the season 9-11 that i needed, so your torrents are a big help. i am seeding this one for awhile, and if you let me know when/if you upload the real episode 10, i will dl and see that also (even though i watched it already lol) just so everyone else can see it."
,sykoskit,2012-09-25T19:10Z," now if you could just get seasons 12 & 13... i have looked everywhere... those are the 2 i want to watch the most, especially 12 with britney... if you find them, post a comment on here letting me know cause i got this torrent page bookmarks, so i'll check it reg. if you can't get those 2 seasons on torrent, can you help me find them anywhere online? i tried youtube for season12, but some parts of some episodes and i think some full episodes are missing... at least from what i saw. "
,bc0730,2012-09-25T19:37Z,I already posted Big Brother US Season 12 and I am working on 13 now
,bc0730,2012-09-25T19:39Z,And episode 10 has been uploaded separate from this as well. Just click on my name and it will show you everything you asked about
,sykoskit,2012-09-25T19:52Z,"anyways, any help u can offer with seasons 12/13, i would greatly appreciate it, and i will help anyway i can with episode 10 for this one, just comment here and i'll try to check it as often as possible. thanks man, i truly do appreciate all ur work, if it weren't for you i wouldn't be able to watch mr dan gheesling win lol."
,sykoskit,2012-09-25T19:53Z,oh wow ok.. thanks a lot man... i'll seed 12 too
,sykoskit,2012-09-25T19:54Z,.
,bc0730,2012-09-26T00:37Z,"This endeavor actually began because of my wife's obsession with Dan and Big Brother.  I started compiling all the episodes from all the season and then realized there were no full seasons on here after season 9 and I was annoyed myself by having to download individual episodes which is what is taking so long on Season 13, it takes forever to download 30 episodes, I am on day 4 of that and it is ridiculous!"

This link is to the REAL episode 10 of this season since somehow, this ended up with 2 episode 11s."
