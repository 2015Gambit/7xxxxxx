Mtume (pronounced em-tu-may) was a funk and soul group that had several R&B hits in the 1980s. Its founder, percussionist James Mtume, previously played with Miles Davis in the 1970s. Other members of the group included Reggie Lucas and Tawatha Agee.

They will always be remembered for such its as YOU, ME and HE, JUICYFRUIT, BREATHLESS to name a few. Like other great groups of the time like the SOS BAND, Atlantic Starr, Starpoint etc MTUME looked to keep R&B alive and going well. Sadly like all good artist and groups, the record industry pushed good groups and artists aside for so called "NEW" music, which was more bland and without clear category.
