Hawaiian Music: Honolulu - Hollywood - Nashville 1937-1944~2-CD (Fremeaux) [320KB] {MKOP}

Hawaiian music of the early 20th century exerted a considerable influence on all American popular music, from country music to the blues. This anthology takes the listener from Honolulu to Nashville, via Hollywood, a musical excursion replete with vitality and swing. 

The path traced by this volume's subtitleΓÇôHonolulu, Hollywood, NashvilleΓÇôfollows the steel guitar's expanding popularity beyond Hawaii's shores. The group of musicians active in Hollywood filmmaking in the 1930s include Andy Iona, Sol Ho'poi'i and Sam Koki. Nashville marks the steel guitar's crossover into what eventually came to be known as ''country & western'' music.
