Prager 20120921   2 Happiness Hour: Drama Kings and Queens

Prager H2... ItΓÇÖs very difficult to be happy living with a Drama King or Queen. It is also hard to be happy if

Prager H1... Mitt RomneyΓÇÖs campaign is struggling. But there is a way out. He just has to articulate with
 clarity and passion that we are at risk of becoming Europe West. The values the President and the Left push
 for are not American values. They are European valuesΓÇª 
 Did Chick Fil A cave to gay activists to get Chicago franchises. ThatΓÇÖs how it looks nowΓÇª 
 ObamaΓÇÖs Muslim Mideast policy is in shambles. Can you imagine what the media would be saying about
