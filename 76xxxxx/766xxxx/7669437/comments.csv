,JWBly,2012-09-25T01:47Z,"CAPTAIN7SS - you are my personal hero for providing these torrents every day.  The best since jwhitt62, who mysteriously just disappeared almost exactly a year ago.  I'm sure I speak for many when I say - THANK YOU so very much!

I am curious though - why the different stations?  I actually enjoy changing it up a bit, but I just wondered if this is for some specific purpose or just whatever station you happened to come across each day?  

Anyway - THANKS again, my friend!"
