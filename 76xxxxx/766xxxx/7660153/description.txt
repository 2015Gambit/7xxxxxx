Screen On/Off Using gestures:

Want to feel what gestures can do? Here's an application which will let
you turn off/on your screen just with a swipe!! Swipe your hand over the proximity sensor (Located near the earpiece on top of the phone).

Features:

    Pocket/Flip or Smart Cover Mode: Turns screen OFF when sensor covered and ON when uncovered. (Feature requested by Galaxy Note users)
    Swipe to Screen Off: Turn OFF the screen by sliding your hand 
    Cover to Screen Off: Turn OFF the screen by Covering the sensor for a duration of time (Cover and Hold)
    Cover to Screen On: Turn ON the screen by Covering the sensor for a duration of time (Cover and Hold) - Note: This can cause Battery Drain
    Ignore Apps list: Add the apps/games where you want to disable the service 
    Widget: to start and stop the service 
    ScreenOff shortcut: to turn off the screen by launching the app. 
    Sensor Configuration : Based on your device select the sensor of your choice, or the one that's available and configure their values, as they are different for different devices. 
    Enable screen on/off during calls only
    Disable call handling completely
    De-Activate sensors after timeout
    Override power button and screen-on by other apps (Phone is in pocket and you get a call or you accidentally press the power button, screen will remain off)
    Prevent accidental screen on
    Disable accidental lock - in Swipe to Screen Off mode if the sensor is covered for longer than specified duration screen wont turn off 
    Vibration on screen On/Off

NOTE:

    Removing/Uninstalling the app
        Launch ProximityScreenOff Pro and click Uninstall button 
        System Settings , "Locations & Security" or just "Security" , Select Device Administrators and disable the ScreenOff App
    App needs Device Administrator privilege to lock the screen, If you have any questions on permissions used by the app, please send me an email and i will explain you the reason app needs them.
    To enable lock screen - Use option "Locks phone on screenOn" under "All settings"
