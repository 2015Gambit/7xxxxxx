There's only one HD on TPB, and the uploader TOOK OUT THE INCLUDED ENGLISH SUBS!!!! No subs can be found online, either.  I'd be really grateful."

It should have english sub included. 

All I found is this:
Puccini.La.Boheme.2009.Blu-ray.720p.x264.DTS-KBu.torrent 

but its 2009 not 2008 so I think is smth else."
