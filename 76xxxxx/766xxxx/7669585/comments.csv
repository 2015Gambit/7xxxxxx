,Ybarbo,2012-09-25T05:13Z,It would seem that the fifth page is corrupted. When you have the time a fixed version would be most appreciated. Thank you. 
,hulivar,2012-09-25T05:39Z,like 4 or 5 pages showed up fucked to me.  Thanks anyway...this is the 2nd shit comic in past few uploads dude was up?
,hulivar,2012-09-25T05:44Z,"Also in situations like these you can go to DC++ to get comics guys.  For some reason I get a database error when trying to explain it in a comment...and it wont let me type out hub names...it's very odd.

If you want an idiot's proof guide to setting it up leave your email.  DC++ is a file sharing medium where you can get anything on earth and it's free...basically everyone meets up in a chatroom with their own share list of comics/movies/whatever and everyone downloads from everyone else.  Most hubs have like 100-200 terabytes of shit.  "
,Bubbers83,2012-09-25T08:32Z,can you do a posting of all spawn issues since 200?
,SplhcbPrime,2012-09-25T14:40Z,"i tried DC++ and it was verrry confusing, and most difficult to configure, and i am a technician by trade.  personally, i would not recommend DC++ for most users.  i will stick with thepiratebay.se, for sure!"
[T],mdusanjay,2012-09-25T17:41Z,yst day reinstalled the os..yet to install comic viewer..looking for a 64 bit version..sorry yar..will fix it soon..
,hulivar,2012-09-25T19:19Z,"everytime I write out a long explanation I get a fucking ass error.  Fuck the comments on the piratebay god damint.

I just wrote out a long ""for dummies"" guide to DC++ that any newb could easily follow and I got this.  


    Unable to fetch dataUnable to execute queryUnable to fetch dataUnable to fetch dataUnable to fetch dataUnable to fetch dataUnable to execute query 

The past 2 times I tried to write an explanation I got this error


Database Error:

Shit's annoying man.  I ended up saving one of my explanations...it's not nearly as good as the others I wrote but it's ok I guess.  If you want an idiot proof DC++ guide though just leave your email and I'll retype one up I guess.  Bah"
,hulivar,2012-09-25T19:20Z,"lol I've tried to type out a long ass explanation on 4 other comments and I got an error each time.  I give up lol.

But ya is super easy to use dude.  Can you maybe tell me what you found confusing?  I will type a somewhat short explanation to each of your questions...if I write out a long comment it will get an error probably...grrrrrr"
