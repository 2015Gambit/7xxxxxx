,MP4SUX,2012-09-23T08:37Z,"I think you have a couple of things confused.

Most importantly, the quality of this file is EXACTLY what HBO presented (read the description).

CC2AVI means NO LOSS of quality.

Unless you're talking about the sound - AAC has problems in an AVI container.

But the video is byte for byte, pixel per pixel the exact video that was posted."
