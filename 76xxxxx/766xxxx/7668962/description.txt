NOTES:
For whatever reason, no matter how many times I attempted to plug the desired bitrate into the script, it refused to accept it. I decided I was tired of fucking with it, and you can either enjoy this high bitrate 2 gig file, or you can reencode it to a smaller size yourself. If you are a fan of David Lynch, this is the new film from his daughter, Jennifer. She also directed the film "Surveillance" if you happened to catch that one. Enjoy the new release movie. And, sorry for the big size.

AXED! We do this better.
