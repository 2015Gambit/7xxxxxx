Kobayashi's Inn of Evil is a bleak yakuza story about a gang of smugglers awaiting an inevitable doom. In the setting of the Tokugawa era, Japan was under strict isolation from the outside world and foreign trade was forbidden. With the upper class having an appetite for exotic goods, there was a booming black market that the "heroes" of our story operate in. Their headquarters on a tiny island is a seedy establishment ironically called the Easy Tavern. It's a private club that doesn't admit outsiders, but three strangers who pass through its doors will change everything.
