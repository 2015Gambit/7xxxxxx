Never done three different versions (could've done four w/TLA) ...

But this one's special - actual "out of the Scene bubble" native XVID AVI
Brit show encoded by Brits and greatfully passed onto you by myself unchanged
Well, tweaked the filename a bit - gotta keep track.

For the record - no one to give credit to - no NFO, no TAG, nothing
I suspect remnants of a downed popular UK site (shhhh...)
