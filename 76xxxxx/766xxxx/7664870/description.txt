Abraham-Hicks Video #13 Disaster and Destruction DVD


From Video #13: Disaster and Destruction or The Edge of Adventure?


 In this program compiled from the first workshop held in 2005, Abraham responds to heartfelt 
concerns about the devastating war in Iraq and the recent Tsunami devastation, as well as 
questions about taxes and earth-changes in general.

Then Jerry engages Abraham in a dialog about whether our inner guidance can steer us away from 
death, and asks for their perspective on suicidal beings.

Finally, Abraham brings their unique point of view to the topic of "Bipolar Disorder", and 
talks to a family physician about teaching "wellness".

With current events in the news weighing on many, Abraham's timely observations here are like 
a breath of fresh air.

Recorded in Tampa, Florida on January 8th, 2005.
