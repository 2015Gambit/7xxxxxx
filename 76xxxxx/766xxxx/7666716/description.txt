This is a collection I created for Element 3D. I got tired of having to reskin models every time I imported them. So I fixed these and figured I would share them.

Pack includes:

AH-64D Apache Longbow
F-14 Tomcat
AH-6 Little Bird
Sea Knight
Tiger Attack Helicopter


Please note: I did not make or skin these models. I simply imported them into Element 3D, applied the proper skins, and saved them so others can use them as well in their projects.

Just add the directories to your "MyModels" folder.


Thanks,
