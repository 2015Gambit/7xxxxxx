"This instructional movie was scripted and filmed entirely for the purpose of this series. It was meant to serve the equipment section and not the story or performance, which are secondary. It is there to educate, not to entertain.
This movie is simply a means of delivering information to the student and also to create a base for all the movie production dvds. That way, when you watch the movie production dvds, you feel like you've already come in contact with the scenes earlier. You do not have to watch the instructional movie to get the information from the production section. If you simply want to learn production, just go ahead and skip this DVD."
