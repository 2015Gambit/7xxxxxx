,blah36,2012-09-23T01:51Z,Thanks much now all I am missing is season 4
,blah36,2012-09-23T02:03Z,"Oops I forgot I am missing a bit from season 2, do you have those?"
,blah36,2012-09-23T02:22Z,Oh and for first torrents I read that you need to turn on initial seed with utorrent or superseed in other torrent programs. Make sure you turn it off once you have multiple seeders
,noheat,2012-09-23T17:10Z,"@blah36...  Thanks for the advice, here's a link to my season 2 up that I just added.  I haven't seen any season 4."

,noheat,2012-09-29T16:33Z,"Ok, my pc is back up and running, but I messed up the torrents and couldn't figure out what I did or how to fix them. I created a new up for all my society stuff and it can be found here.
