As of today, this is currently the highest quality 720P BRRIP of this movie.  There are a couple lower bitrate torrents available, but they compromise the video quality with such low bitrates.  Contrary to what the last line of the torrent description says, the subs in this movie are NOT hard coded (as they shouldn't be for any modern movie file since they can easily be put on a separate track in an MP4 or MKV file), so anybody can download this movie and enjoy it without being stuck looking at foreign subs.  English subs were also provided on a second subtitle track.  The only reason I took a point off for the audio is due to the 2 channel AAC format.  Sound quality and levels are otherwise fine.  

Thanks!"

Not sure if the extended cut did actually make it on to the Blu-Ray, but if it did, nobody has made that torrent available yet."
