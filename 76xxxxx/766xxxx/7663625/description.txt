Lyrics:

Uh, I can't go any further than this
Uh. I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

Whoa, I spent my time just thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missin', missin' you
And all those things we use, to use, to use, to use to do
Hey girl, wuz up, it use, to use to be just me and you
I spent my time just thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missin', missin' you
And all those things we use, to use, to use, use to do
Hey girl, wuz up, girl, wuz up, wuz up, wuz up

Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait, for you
I'll be lookin' out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish

Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe, I go to other galaxies
Just tell me where you go, just tell me where you want to meet
I navigate myself, myself, to take me where you'll be
'Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown (town), I travel downtown
Wanna have you around ('round) like every single day
I love you all way, way

Enjoy and Seed. - YahSoft
