Leap is a combination Spotlight, Bridge, Finder, and more. The Finder on OS X is slow, and cumbersome, limited to 10,000 search results, and having a very cumbersome search interface. Leap shows you all of them, and more importantly - where they are on your computer. No other tool does this. Works great for images, pdfs, too. Leap does not force you to put documents in a special place, it uses no databases. Just see whats on your hard drive.

Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later.
