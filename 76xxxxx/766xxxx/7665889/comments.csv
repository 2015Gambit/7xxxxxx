,Dillin,2012-09-24T03:20Z,"the nature of imperialism is a policy which is often associated with conquest andÂ colonization, but imperialismâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s core is commercial. As stated above, imperialism is the practice of one country extending its control over the territory, political system, & Military, & economic life of another country. However, the nature of imperialism is ultimately concerned with just the economic part of that definition because the essential qualities and characteristics by which imperialism is recognized are commercial."
,unscarred786,2012-09-24T05:13Z,Anyone who watches this movie and believes half the shit in it is retarded and will be treated as such. Do your own research people..

,SelfBuilt,2012-09-24T08:53Z,"Finally a movie that is for every American.  This movie be in history books. 

America had a chance this year to elect a President that has the statue of Jefferson, Ron Paul, but is too brainwashed and cannot see past their own selves to realize that Ron Paul is a founding father based on his past, present, and future predictions and views. 

I didnt vote for Obama and never would have before this video because I can sense a snake when I see one."
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T06:27Z,"Ron Paul was indeed the best American statesman of the last half-century, but don't let ""perfect"" become the enemy of ""good"" (or a ""lesser evil"", at least, which is what Romney clearly is when compared to Obama).

If you're in a swing state, please vote for Romney!

I'm in NJ, so I'll vote for Gary Johnson instead..."
,epiconedude,2012-09-25T06:52Z,"torrent is the real deal.  content of the documentary is also legit.  everyone should see this, whether you like obama or not!"
,jojojojjo,2012-09-25T07:12Z,"Idiots who claim this movie a piece of propaganda are worst than ostrich sticking head in the sand. This Kenyan punk is turning America into third world country. You idiot need to wake up and act before you look like Kenyan and Pakistani running  behind a piece of bread like Egyptians  by 2016...........
If you can comprehend! This whole movie is based on the facts spoken by Obama family and friend in Kenya.
Wake up!!"
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T16:27Z,"Obama needed to disown his Communist father and Communist mentors in order to become an American.  Instead he embraced them - which this movie demonstrates beyond all doubt, using Obama's own book as evidence.

Obama supporters have no business living in a nation founded for capitalism and individual liberty - if they have even a milligram of integrity, they should all move to a more socialist country ASAP!"
