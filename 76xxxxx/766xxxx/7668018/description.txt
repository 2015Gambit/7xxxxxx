Requirements: ANDROID:2.2 and up and a phone with a front camera
Overview: GotYa! takes a silent snapshot through the front facing camera of the criminal who is attempting to use your device, whenever the screen lock is entered incorrectly. After taking the picture, it acquires the location of your device and forms a Google maps link, sending it with the timestamped picture to your email/Facebook !

*See* the face and *locate* who stole your device ! Do you want to know who's using your device, stealing it, or just opening it up and snoop around on it for less than a beer price ? Well, GotYa! is your choice!
By having an unlock code on your device GotYa! hooks into that, and once the password/pin/pattern is entered wrong, it allows the device to take a pic of the face of the thief, log the location, and send you an email/Facebook !
You can even tell GotYa! to shoot and locate every time the screen turns on ! Moreover, through simple remote SMS commands, you can even :
- Request remotely a location
- Request remotely a call back
- Play remotely an alarm sound
- Be notified on SIM change
Forget about others anti-theft application ! GotYa! is THE choice !

This is the FULL version of GotYa!, with the following *outstanding* features :
- *FULL* size image capture
- Email/Facebook notifications support with location
- Remote SMS commands
- Smart screen ON capture trigger
- Queued system notifications support
- Incremental, timestamped, captures support

Be sure to setup the system screen lock and that's it !
GotYa! memory needs are NULL : since GotYa! is deeply hooked into the screen lock, no permanent service is needed : it is only started on wrong login. It will NOT start long running services, excepted for sending emails but will shutdown as soon as finished.
