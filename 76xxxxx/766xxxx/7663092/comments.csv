,3Dazz,2012-09-23T03:30Z,Does this version have a way of getting it to work without having the iLoK dongle or Pace anti piracy installed?
,Kiddy76,2012-09-23T09:05Z,Team VR does it again!!!
,mercurysoto,2012-09-23T16:55Z,Time to start using Bootcamp for real :) It's Xmas time even for Mac users.
,3Dazz,2012-09-24T14:22Z,"Confirmed working 100%. Now I can listen to my bands latest demo and play around with it.
I'm sure you all know this but if you dont have the hardware eg: M audio box or some type of specialised audio card, download ASIO4ALL and you can at least listen without having to buy hardware.
TX to uploader, this is the only one that works as described. Easy install."

,lucbl3,2012-09-25T02:11Z,"I use a different (SSD) hd for windows and another one for programs, but i think that the patch doesn't work. Is there a solution? Do i have to mess with Windows Registry?"
,mercurysoto,2012-09-27T05:19Z,"Ok, I got it running on Mac in a Bootcamp partition. So far so good. I m using ASIO4ALL in a MAcBook Pro with OSX 10.6.8. Kontakt is fine and so is Waves 9. I still get no errors."
,Oathstalker,2012-09-29T23:25Z,"It includes the cracked setup for Pro Tools 10.3.0.

It works fine on my laptop, I am going to test it with Waves 9 plug ins on Monday!

Many thanks Ching_Liu for this upload, it will strongly improve my way of making music now!!

,funkmasterspecs,2012-09-30T05:34Z,"Just a heads up: this seems to be a really unstable release.
Everyone's reporting timebombs after ~30 mins or so: ""MF: application has been compromised""

I think TEAM V.R will be delivering a stable release quite soon. (Rumours of Beta 8?)
In the meantime lets all have fun screwing around with this :D

Hats off to TEAM V.R for doing this one. PACE and iLok have been rampant, running around loose for too long! Great to have some one put their foot down."
,prince227,2012-09-30T07:08Z,"After 10 to 30 minutes of using this program I get the message ""MF: application has been compromised"" . Is there something I did wrong or is this a common problem everyone is having?"
,Kiddy76,2012-09-30T11:50Z," ""MF: application has been compromised"" 

This fix works for me: ""Disable AUTOSAVE feature"""
,prince227,2012-09-30T22:37Z,"So Kiddy76 so to fix the ""MF: application has been compromised"" issue all I have to do is ""Disable AUTOSAVE feature"" "
,Kiddy76,2012-10-01T02:39Z,Yep just disable AUTO SAVE and remember to save manually every now and then.
,prince227,2012-10-01T05:34Z,Thanks also does this work with all interfaces? including mbox 2 and 002 rack? because everytime I use it it crashes on me but I plan on doing what kiddy said. I was just wondering if there is any other problems anyone has been having with this pro tools.
,Kiddy76,2012-10-01T06:24Z,"try holding the ""N"" key while opening Pro Tools and see if you can select the 002 as the audio engine."
,prince227,2012-10-01T07:03Z,Thanks again guys. I will test this out tomorrow. Please keep me updated if this works without any issues or if it is still unstable. 
,prince227,2012-10-01T08:09Z,How do I disable autosave?
,Kiddy76,2012-10-01T13:23Z,From top menu > Setup > Preferences > Operation Tab >>> uncheck AUTO BACKUP
,prince227,2012-10-03T17:31Z,"After disabling autosave and also deleting Avid Pro tools 10hd driver, it seems to be more stable. I will keep on running tests. Please let me know if this works for you guys too or if there is something else that works too. "
