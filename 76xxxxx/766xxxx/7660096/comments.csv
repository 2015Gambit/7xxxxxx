BTW is Spartacus original or is it schrinked?

[T],keeybee,2012-09-22T11:53Z,"Thanks! Thunderball is home now.
Spartacus is shrinked. However I don't stripp any audio tracks or subtitles. I hope you will enjoy it."
[V],Lindoffs,2012-09-22T13:09Z,"Oh, I have it already, but in single disk DL version. It was just the extras that interested me... That the reason why I only work with original. If you want something, just make a note on my last upload and I'll see what I can do! I have 6500 to choose from.

[T],keeybee,2012-09-22T13:40Z,Just to avoid confusion. Spartacus is ul as two iso files. Both are shrinked to fit for easy burning. But I never strip anything except for warnings when possible.
