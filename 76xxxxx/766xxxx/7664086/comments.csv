@ani12 I remembered your asking from last week when I got new releases. Unfortunately, I have tried to watch Moonrise Kingdom and endured even half hour into. Big WTF above my head and bitter taste in my mouth are only things left. I would never understand casting of that movie, directing it even less. So, casting agency and agents and a director should be shot dead and hanged by the neck just to be absolutely sure how they are dead.
Could you derive a ""No, thanks"" from aforementioned?"

,doyll49,2012-09-23T12:56Z,"Thank you sir!

Watched premiere episodes of ""Last Resort"" and ""Revolution"" enjoyed them.  Will be interesting to see where they go.  "
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-23T12:58Z,"All ""Anger Management"" episodes are lost (were my regular upload) together with 1.7 TB of my other encodes. I am trying to do some anew, but it takes time and some things must be dropped out."
