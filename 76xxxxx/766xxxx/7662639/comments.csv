Can't wait for The Angels Take Manhattan."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:14Z,You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files! More formats would be great! Especially the old proper xvid releases!

You are one seriously clueless moron.

x264 is a better encoder, it gives smaller file size/better quality.  

That is why major encode groups are switching.

Also MSD releases are specifically about being small, so no one is going switch them out for old XVids.

PS3 plays X264 MP4 files natively. So do most Blu Ray players.

So stop being a clueless whiny butthead.  

You clearly don't have a clue what you are talking about.

Time to upgrade from your 1990's DVD player, the world is moving on from Xvid.

I know you don't have much in the way of brains, but you see the search box above. Type in ""doctor who xvid""

Then you don't need to spend all your time whining."
