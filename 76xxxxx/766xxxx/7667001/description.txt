MailDroid is an ad-supported Webdav/POP3/IMAP Idle Push mail client written from the ground up and and not based on the stock Android mail client.
This is the Pro version of MailDroid and contains no ads.

The pro version will contain some extra features that are not available in the ad version. Support for the pro version is the same as for the ad version (email only and no phone).

ACTIVESYNC AND CALENDAR IS NOT SUPPORTED YET!

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE AD VERSION

    Export your settings to your SD card (you must have version 1.70+ which has this feature) from the global preferences screen
    Uninstall MailDroid Ad version (you don't need it anymore and can uninstall it at any point)
    Install MailDroid Pro
    On the accounts screen, import your settings

NOTES

    MailDroid Pro does not require the extra permissions required for ads
    MailDroid Pro does not require the extra ad required files and is therefore a smaller file
    MailDroid Pro uses less memory and cpu because no ads are shown
    MailDroid Pro uses less bandwidth and data because no ads are shown

ADDITIONAL FEATURES IN PRO

    Up/Down arrow in email to move to next or previous emails
    Ability to set where to go after deleting an email (next/previous or back to inbox)
    Widget
    More will be coming...
