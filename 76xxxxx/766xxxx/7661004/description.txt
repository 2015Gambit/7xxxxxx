Hi again!
Here is one gift to all retro gamers there from the glorious days of our childhood.

Containing
1. Age Of Empires II
2. Expansion

No need to install. Just open the folder, double click on age2_x1.exe or empires2.exe and play.

Linux Users:
 I hope you have that magnificent WINE installed. Open the folder, right click on age2_x1.exe or empires2.exe and select "open with WINE Windows Program Loader"


Like my every release, all the games will work fine in Linux. Tested in Fedora 14 & Kubuntu 11.10

Forget not to
1. say thanks
2. more importantly, seed after you finish downloading.
