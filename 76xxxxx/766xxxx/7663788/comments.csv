,ufelmmando,2012-09-24T01:15Z,"Since the description mentions the rip is for high-spec systems, I just wondered if someone would be good enough to advise me before I download of whether my system can can handle this. I'm running 32 bit Windows 7 on a dual-core CPU at 2 GHZ with 4 GB of RAM and ample hard drive space. Thanks in advance for your answer; other prospective downloaders will probably find it useful as well."
