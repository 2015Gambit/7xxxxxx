After install, go into the install DIR and make a shortcut of the .exe & rename it to The Lost Artifact or what ever you want. Use the shortcut to launch the game everytime, or you won't be able to save your progress. If using Xpadder, copy the Xpadder folder onto your hard drive and run the xpadder.exe (If you don't already have Xpadder). If you already have xpadder on your PC, just copy the game profiles into your profile folder, game works well.
NOTE: You must have the ISO mounted, or a burnt CD of the game in your CD-DVD drive."
