Jimmy and the Whale Whisperer
Jimmy Doherty travels to the Caribbean island of Dominica to meet Andrew Armour who befriended an injured sperm whale calf he nicknamed Scar ten years ago. Since then he has claimed he can communicate with Dominican Sperm whales. If Andrew is for real, Jimmy hopes he and top whale scientist Professor Joy Reidenberg can help him get close enough to these gigantic, intelligent and little-known animals to explore recent scientific findings that suggest whales play a crucial role in keeping our oceans healthy.
