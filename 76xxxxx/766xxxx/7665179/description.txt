The Story of Shanghai Jazz:
In the colourful cabarets and sepia-lit dance halls of Old Shanghai, Jazz music set the background score to a fleshy world of mobsters, adventurers, and sing-song girls. Old Shanghai was the uncontested Jazz capital of Asia, where musicians from the World over tested their musical mettle nightly to the delight of enthusiastic audiences.

In 1935, Du Yu Sheng, the notorious overlord of Shanghai's ominous "Green Gang" ordered into creation the first all-Chinese jazz group, called "The Clear Wind Dance Band", to perform at the Yangtze River Hotel Dance Hall. Critics called this music ΓÇÿpornographic,ΓÇÖ but the band played on just the same.

The wheels of time brought Shanghai's heady heyday to an end as the once-bustling nightclubs were boarded up or converted into Communist factory buildings, and Jazz music was outlawed as an 'indecent' form of entertainment...Until Now.

The Album:
"Shanghai Jazz: Musical Seductions from China's Age of Decadence" features classics like ΓÇ£De Bu Dao De Ai QingΓÇ¥ (The Love you CanΓÇÖt Get), delivered through the titillating gravel-voice of ΓÇÿGingerΓÇÖ Zheng ZhiXiao. Things get jumping with tunes like the riotous ΓÇ£Wo Yao Ni De AiΓÇ¥ (I Want Your Love)ΓÇöcharged with life and humor by the confidently flamboyant ΓÇÿCocoΓÇÖ Zhao Ke, and closes with a bittersweet version of ΓÇ£Qing Ren de Yan LeiΓÇ¥ (Lovers Tears) sung with heart-wrenching compassion by ΓÇÿCarrieΓÇÖ Zhang Le.

In total ΓÇ£Shanghai JazzΓÇ¥ contains contributions from a cast of more than twenty talented young Chinese musicians, the leaders of an exciting jazz revival amidst the dramatic social and economic reform of the New Shanghai.
