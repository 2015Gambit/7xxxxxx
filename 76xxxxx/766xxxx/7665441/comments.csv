,HTok,2012-09-24T19:18Z,"IF YOUR SAVE ERASED

YOU CAN FIX IT BY GOING TO:

path_to_gameTony Hawks Pro Skater HDBinariesWin32THPSHDCFile.bin

COPY: CFILE.BIN PASTE IT to your my documents (backup old file first)

Windows 7/Windows Vista
C:UsersUSERNAMEDocumentsMy GamesTony Hawk Pro Skater HDTHHDGameConfigCFile.bin

Windows XP users just check your my documents. Your Path is a bit different.

Start game again and you should have your old progress.

If you didnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t use update yet backup your files before running update just in case."
