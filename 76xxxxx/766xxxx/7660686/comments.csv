,SCSA420,2012-09-22T13:49Z,You're welcome. Are there any Star Wars The Clone Wars series fans here who like my 720p releases? How about the new season 5 of Star Wars The Clone Wars in 720p HD which starts in 2 weeks? I plan on capturing it every week in 720p like I used to do in XviD for season 1 in 2008-2009
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-22T19:37Z,"not really but i would luv u if u would do these tv series, bones, new girl, fringe, ncis, ncis la and two and a half men.all these are about 2 start airing.bones is already on its 1st episode.let me know if u think ull do any cuz i luv ur rips.thanks"
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-22T19:41Z,also if u do these i dont think ull need the bit rate as high as wrestling torrents cuz there isnt as much stuff happening on the screen so if u can make them around 500-600 mbs each plz do it lol space is running out.most hd rips are like 1gb and is 2 big for alot of us.thanks
,shaban96,2012-09-23T04:21Z,any chance u could upload Transformers prime?
