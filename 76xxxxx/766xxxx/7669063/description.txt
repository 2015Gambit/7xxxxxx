Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 Proper (c) Konami

09/2012 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom  Serial
1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Sports

Note: Besides using the usual cheap Securom hack, SKIDROWs release crashes
For instance when starting a match. We could point out that the crash is due
to a broken data file (imgdt07.img). We could also point out that this file
is also broken on a version of this game out on p2p. We could even point out
that the files are identical. But it seems a bit pointless when they get
away with this week after week. The practice appears to be as systematic as
their denial of it. And other groups and siteops implicitly accepts it
We don't know if this says more about them, or the scene. Cheers
