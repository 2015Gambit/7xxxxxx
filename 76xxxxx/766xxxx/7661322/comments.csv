I second that. Thank you!"
,LuxLOL,2012-09-22T19:04Z,A better quality wouldn't hurt we live in 2012 not 1998.
,upx3,2012-09-22T19:18Z,Decent quality at a small footprint AND Overtime FTW !
,trace535,2012-09-22T22:53Z,"LuxLOL, are you kidding me? The quality here is perfect.

In 1998, you had to watch minuscule 240x180 video compressed with blocky, lossy MPEG-1 or even worse the very shit RealVideo codec (remember that?)."
,moonerman100,2012-09-22T23:55Z,Thanks! Especially for taking the time to include overtime in it too.
,ItsASpork,2012-09-23T00:18Z,Another great upload.
,EliteBeast,2012-09-23T00:51Z,Great quality at a small size. 
,EliteBeast,2012-09-23T00:53Z,"you are the "" X264 KING """
,lyra666,2012-09-23T05:16Z,"I love the size and yes! the quality is excellent - my one request would be to chance the audio codec as the two DVD/media players I own, LG & Samsung, won't play Vorbis. AAC/MP3 are, in general, more universal for peeps playing on external devices VS the computer.

Many thanks, even if I can't use your torrents! "
,trace535,2012-09-24T01:32Z,"lyra666, you can use Handbrake to re-encode the audio to AAC or MP3."
