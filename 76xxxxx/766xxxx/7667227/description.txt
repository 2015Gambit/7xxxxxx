Miami-based producer Marcus Banks has come together with The DJBooth to bring listeners his debut instrumental tape, Sunday School.

The project comprises 10 original tracks from the up-and-coming beatsmith previously heard lending his production stylings to cuts by Add-2 ("Modern Day Coons") and Fuze the MC ("Super Music"). All samples throughout the project are drawn from vintage gospel records.
