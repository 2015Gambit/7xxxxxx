Abraham-Hicks Law Of Attraction In Action EP1-4 HQ DVDRip


Esther and Jerry Hicks produce the Leading Edge Abraham-Hicks teachings on the Art of Allowing our natural Well-Being to come forth. Law of Attraction workshops held in up to 60 cities per year inspire a regular flow of Abraham books, CDs, and DVDs. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

Law of Attraction says, "That which is like unto itself is drawn." Everything is valid and everything is truthful, because Law of Attraction lets everything be. The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham ΓÇö whom Esther calls "infinite intelligence" and Jerry refers to as "the purest form of love I've ever encountered."

Living a better-feeling life really comes down to one thing only: coming into alignment with the Energy of our Source. Abraham reminds us that we are truly Source Energy focused into our physical bodies, and that a conscious Connection to that Broader Non-Physical part of us is necessary if we are to be the joyful Beings that we were born to be. Abraham calls that wonderful alignment Getting into the Vortex.

"Whenever you attend an Abraham-Hicks seminar, the first thing you'll notice that sets them apart from all others is that the seminars are interactive on many levels. The agenda is never pre-determined, but is spontaneously created by Abraham's response to the participants in the workshop. It is uncanny how Abraham is aware of not only the consensus of questions in the audience, but every individual question that arises in the room as the seminar progresses."
