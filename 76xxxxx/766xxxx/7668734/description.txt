Kathy Reichs, like her fictional creation, Temperance Brennan, is forensic anthropologist for the province of Quebec. She is Vice President of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, serves on the Canadian National Police Services Advisory Council, and is one of only fifty-six forensic anthropologists certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology. A professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Dr. Reichs now divides her time between Charlotte and Montreal. Deja Dead, her debut novel, brought her fame when it became a New York Times bestseller and won the 1997 Ellis Award for Best First Novel. In 2007 Break No Bones was short- listed for the Ellis Award for Best Novel. Kathy Reichs is the inspiration for the television drama Bones

Again, these are not my rips - they are books I have downloaded from others in the past.  While searching for Book 15 Bones are Forever I noticed that not even these were coming up for me anymore, so I am re-sharing.  I have listened to all of these files and had no issues.  I listen to a ton of audio books and have been grateful to be able to find downloads in the past.  I am hopeful I will be able to add Bones are Forever soon.

Thank you to the original uploaders.
