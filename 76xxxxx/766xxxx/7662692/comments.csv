,dagqua,2012-09-23T00:36Z,Thank you very much
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-23T01:03Z,"You should really upload Doctor Who as an avi encoded with xvid like you used to every week when there was a new episode. File size no less than 350mb with the mp3 audio around 128kbps. Enough with this x264 crap! It's nice to be able to play episodes on a dvd/bluray player or a PS3. With x264 you have to rely on a computer. That's why most movies on here are xvid/divx encoded avi files!

,dee60,2012-09-23T01:44Z,Thanks for sharing.
,Lord_Ra,2012-09-23T01:51Z,"@ BUTT_SEX
You are really ungrateful pitiful excuse for a human being "
,revjim29,2012-09-23T01:56Z,"@BUTT_SEX You complain about this every week but you aren't going to change anything. Buy a modern bluray player that can handle x264.

It's called PROGRESS and it's not going to stop because of your whining."
,garlor,2012-09-23T02:11Z,@BUTT_SEX recode it to your liking
,katelynor,2012-09-23T02:53Z,Thanks!
,plstcsldgr,2012-09-23T02:53Z,these play on the ps3 just fine. 
,acc6804,2012-09-23T03:01Z,"@Butt_Sex
Stop being an ungrateful prick. If you have such a big issue with this, re encode it yourself, and upload it. You'll be a hero. *snort*

FYI: PS3's play this file with no problems. Shut up and go away!"
,Babysly,2012-09-23T03:33Z,"BUTT SEX every fucking week you bitch like a spoilt brat. If you have a problem with the format, get a converter, or download elsewhere! This is the superior format, so stop whining when you don't know anything ""x264 crap"" wow you are thick!"
,khillik,2012-09-23T04:53Z,"BUTT_SEX 

fuck off 

sincerely everyone"
,SaveCash,2012-09-23T05:01Z,"A10V10 Great upload! 

I wish Butt Sex would stop being so Butt Hurt. It is FREE!

Thanks EZ! You and your people should be Sainted."
,Cleric21,2012-09-23T05:10Z,"Seriously guys? You flip shit at Butt Sex for asking nicely for a different conversion? He's not screaming and bitching and moaning for it. It's annoying that he asks every week, but that doesn't deserve your guys' childish tantrums about his wishes."
,DigFunk,2012-09-23T06:29Z,"@Cleric21: it's because it's EVERY fucking week with the same BS. We get it. EZTV gets it. He doesn't like the mp4 format, oh fucking well. There is absolutely nothing stopping him from releasing an .avi format to pirate bay and other trackers if he thinks they're so necessary. He's being an entitled, immature piece of shit by thinking everyone should acquiesce to HIS needs, especially when it's a free service he should be bending over backwards to thank people for, rather than bitching about. 

@Butt_Sex: dude, how long did it take you to get over the cassette to CD format change? Are you still going into stores like Best Buy and bitching because they won't carry your favorite new bands on tape anymore? Technology progresses, formats change. Get the fuck over it you whiny ass bitch."
,trace535,2012-09-23T06:59Z,"@DigFunk, given the kind of childish responses BUTT_SEX writes (check the comments on the TvTeam release of this episode) I think he was too young to have been around for the cassette to CD transition."
,CapPanda,2012-09-23T07:20Z,".AVI is a file format, x264 is a codec, these are independent of the other"
,sejemaset,2012-09-23T07:25Z,People still use CDs?
,gexgrino,2012-09-23T16:59Z,Thank you
,ManguProff,2012-09-24T04:24Z,thank you so much !
,evilg0d,2012-09-24T10:29Z,"Serious question. If someone, who knows what they're talking about, could suggest to me a video format conversion utility that can convert files uploaded by FoV into ones that my WDTV Live media player can play that would be very much appreciated. It hasn't previously had any problems with Mp4 x264 or not, MKV, AVI, damn near anything. It only seems to have an issue with FoV uploads. 
currently New Tricks and Doctor Who are for me, unplayable.
The software I have tried to do the conversion with, S.U.P.E.R. and RER HD both make a playable file but at least double the file size.
Thanks in advance for any useful suggestions."
,pmf3,2012-09-24T14:34Z,"Thanks! Good as always. 

And as always, BUTT_SEX makes useless comments. 
@BUTT_SEX, just respect the dude for doing an awesome favour for us all."
,trace535,2012-09-24T16:59Z,"evilg0d, try using either Handbrake or Pazera."
,nvmyew,2012-09-24T21:27Z,thx :)
,evilg0d,2012-09-24T23:53Z,Thanks trace535. I'll give them a go.
,DigFunk,2012-09-25T05:53Z,"Yeah, to actually add to the convo a bit instead of just bitching about assholes like I did earlier haha:
the two utilities trace535 posted work great. I've used handbrake before to some success, but it seems like, for me at least (and a lot of people I've seen comment on it), Pazera is the winner of the two. Always seems to work well, and consistently. Prob hard to go wrong with either one though. Also, hey, after you convert it you might upload it here to Pirate Bay, because apparently according to BUTT_SEX (I love typing that out in serious convo, haha), it's a highly in-demand thing that NO ONE can live without!

Also, one final tip: If you've downloaded a file in .mp4 but are having trouble playing it on a specific device, a quick fix is to try renaming the format to .avi rather than .mp4, sometimes this will allow the device to unpack it in a way that allows playback. Not sure exactly why it works, but it will (on occasion, not for every file)."
,evilg0d,2012-09-26T01:00Z,Many thanks trace535. Handbrake worked a treat.
