that date u have fund is not the right one ! 

When is the GTA 5 Release Date?
We do not have an official release date for GTA 5 yet. All GTA 5 Release Dates which you may have seen are guesses and speculation. Of course there's a chance someone may get it right, however many online stores are putting up dates as a way to encourage people to pre-order GTA 5 - they are not official. Rockstar Games have NOT announced a release date for GTA 5 yet.

Based on past games from Rockstar we can speculate on when the game may be released, or even when the release date may be announced..."

If we are unlucky then it comes late 2013!"
