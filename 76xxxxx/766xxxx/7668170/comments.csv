,EliteBeast,2012-09-24T18:28Z,Jesse Ventura 2016 if there is still a country left.  Only vote for Independents. Republicans and Democrats are the same party. Your choice is an illusion. 
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T06:09Z,"That rings true to pessimistic emotions, but doesn't stand an objective factual analysis.  

There *is* some effect coming from the electoral feedback mechanism, with Republicans (especially the more-pro-business less-theocratic ones like Romney and Ryan) clearly being a much lesser evil than the Democrats (especially Barack O'Commie).  I'd say 8-12 years of Republican domination and total Dem collapse is what would be necessary to form a viable Libertarian party and make gradualist reforms.  Good things take time...

Jesse Ventura is very difficult to take seriously.  He sold out to the conspiracy culture, and is willing to push any Looney Toons speculation that sells more water filters and other sponsor prepper gear.  One independent celeb candidate without organized political infrastructure can accomplish very little.

With Ron Paul retiring, people need to reevaluate their choice between the (small-l) libertarian wing of the Republican Party and the (big-L) Libertarian Party, which in this election is represented by Gary Johnson."
,epiconedude,2012-09-25T06:55Z,"good documentary. torrent is the real deal. everyone should watch this, whether you like obama or not. very educational and informative "
,Frank525,2012-09-25T07:08Z,"Lol, this movie is a joke. Obama has been one of the greatest presidents of our time. He's not even really a liberal. He's a centrist at best. He hasn't even implemented that many changes. I'm not sure how you dimwits think he's forever changing the country. "
,jojojojjo,2012-09-25T07:10Z,"Idiots who claim this movie a piece of propaganda are worst than ostrich sticking head in the sand. This Kenyan punk is turning America into third world country. You idiot need to wake up and act before you look like Kenyan and Pakistani running  behind a piece of bread like Egyptians  by 2016...........
If you can comprehend! This whole movie is based on the facts spoken by Obama family and friend in Kenya.
Wake up!!"
,asdfkjjj,2012-09-25T09:48Z,The creator of this film is a joke so I can only imagine how crappy it is.  You should see the Real Time with Bill Maher episode from this season where he takes D'souza APART live on TV. Awesome.
,AlexLibman,2012-09-25T17:08Z,"""One of the greatest presidents of our time""...  what can you say to a person who came up with that line - offering Zero Evidence (as socialists tend to do), and then contradicting oneself (another common socialist trait).  Sounds like something a Jim Jones fan would say between sips of Kool-Aid!

As reasoning with them is impossible, one should just walk away from such a person, and hope they will never have any influence on your life - let idiots perish by their own stupidity!  Unfortunately this isn't possible - we live in a collectivist chain-gang, and idiots like Obama supporters are impossible to escape...

Evidence clearly shows that Obama is no ""centrist"".  Based on his voting record prior to the 2008 election, he was calculated to be the #1 most ""left-wing"" (pro-socialist) Senator.  He cannot act unilaterally as POTUS, but his recent actions were as far to the ""left"" as he could get away with - and he'd of course be able to get away with A LOT more if he has a second term!  And, as this documentary examines (referencing Obama's own book and personal history), his ideological background is soaked with big-C Communist influence!

And, yes, I did see that episode of Dispatches From The Socialist Bubble (aka Real Time w/ Bill Maher).  D'Souza cleaned Maher's pot-soaked clock rather well!  Maher of course had the hehes and the hahas behind him (what else could socialists resort to?), but D'Souza clearly had the facts and analytical reasoning on his side.

As an atheist I have plenty of reasons to look down on D'Souza, but the religious delusions of socialist thugs like Maher (who donated $1mil to Obama) are far, far more dangerous!  This is why I'm pirating both Maher's show and this movie, and would rather donate my money to rationalist libertarian causes instead."

,janimorph007,2012-09-27T17:14Z,"The video quality isn't all that great, as one might expect from a movie with such small resolution.  Nevertheless, this is probably the best you'll get it here.

As far as the contents of this movie, I noticed that Dinesh didn't go too far with his claims.  I've heard even worse than what he's presented here.  He even goes so far as to mention that Barack's birth in Hawaii was announced in 2 local papers, tossing out the idea of an unAmerican president.

Dinesh starts off by saying that he understands where Barack is coming from because of the circumstances of his own upbringing, which is a very reasonable way to start.  But then we see their paths diverge.  Dinesh presents FACTS concerning the liberalism of Barack's mother, the socialistic ideas driving Barack's father and the friends he had in college... the overall anti-American atmosphere in which Barack festered and grew.  We see why our current president has sympathies with third-world muslim countries, and we see how that sympathy for them and lack of belief in the ""American Way"" will lead to the destruction of our Union.

If you disagree with this guy, the burden of proof is on you.  Present your facts, and stop throwing out useless opinions based solely upon what you want to believe.  Too many people out there living their lives as if the world is according to the things in their heads."
,lifeson98,2012-09-28T18:26Z,"By the way - the DVD Rip of this movie with over 1000 Seeds was removed from PirateBay 10 minutes ago.  WHY ??   And who had it removed ??  Does Obama's influence have no end ??

Sadly, Obama has bought off huge voting blocks with his borrowed $6 trillion and misuse of the TARP.  He doubled food stamps and ran ads encouraging people to apply for more food stamps.  He changed the law so that Welfare can be approved with no ""look for Work"" Requirement.  He stopped deportations of proven Illegals.  He bought the women vote too.  With over 50% on govt handouts - he will be hard to stop.  He even sent Holder to prevent States from requiring IDs of voters so the illegals can vote for him.  

While he plays more golf than any President and meets with Hollywood Starts constantly - he refuses to meet with ANY Heads of State and has snubbed his nose at all Job Council meetings this year."
,Merk21582,2012-09-30T15:46Z,"Uploader: Can you please provide the video that is out on DVD now called: ""Occupy Unmasked"" as well?"
,rossdh,2012-10-04T16:25Z,"Finally. After the debates last night, I feel that Romney finally got a fair shot. Sure, we all know that nobody is perfect but Obama did not hold up along side him. Sure, this movie has some rather edgy and theoretical view points, but a few of them were actually validated in the debates yesterday. When I say validated, I mean that Obama's own words and emotional response to some of the topics proved some things about him. There are some other things he does not want to come out yet as well, such as the fact he wanted to violate the law by cutting military spending without 60 days notice to partner companies. The cover up of the recent assassination in the middle east has not been discussed either. There have been reports that we had intelligence of unrest weeks before the violence occurred and nothing was done to protect our citizens. "
,rossdh,2012-10-04T16:34Z,"Another thing, for those who do not believe some of this movie, about 1/2 of it is validated in Obama's own book. Much of the material is just a repeat of the book. Bill Maher was wrong on his interview when he talked about anti-imperialism/colonialism not being relevant. It's actually a strong ideology in the 3rd world. I know because I have lived in south America for three years. (strong in comparison to what it is in ""developed countries"") For those who talk about the Maher interview, Maher actually wrote on twitter last night that he felt Romney won the debate. ......"
,rossdh,2012-10-04T16:53Z,"Thanks uploader, I've been waiting a few months for this one. Ill be making sure others get the opportunity to see it as well. "
