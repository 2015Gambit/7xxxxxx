,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-25T06:18Z,so I finily got to sit & watch all of these.the convert was great.....but the content was....well.....kinda garbage.the guys from UK used nothing but an EM meter & a medium(which I think are 99% fake).the MRIPA group did more setting up than investigating & most of the EVPs thru out the videos sounded nothing like what they said they did.the hospitals were pretty good & the CON-TACT video wasn't bad but the rest were lacking good evidence imo
