,vocalised80,2012-09-25T15:32Z,"So lets begin.........
One good thing is that it is in synch thru entire movie.
13min in Cam is hidden for 1 minute,sound is there but black out screen.
15min in same again but this time 1min 20sec.
both times it takes about 30 sec to re focus.
47:30 min black out again.
48:32 comes back from black out with sound but takes a good 2 min to re-focus.
54:15 black out again (get it together douche)
55:00 comes back and is in focus by this time.
01:09 half of will head is missing for 20 sec

Now i appreciate the effort, been waiting ages and when it's not moving around or re-focusing or the heavy nasal breathing that comes and goes as he re-focus's or what we think is also a heart beat for a few minutes towards the end (close enough to ur chest mate) oh yeh and the eating...... eat when u watch dude, not when ur getting this to give to others to watch, newbie mistake.
So make up ur own A/V and don't say that u have not been warned, me and the wife will def be watching a better copy.

Oh Yeh......... the first 10-15min is MISSING!!!"
