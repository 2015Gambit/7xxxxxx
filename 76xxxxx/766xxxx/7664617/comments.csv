Guess I'm just not convinced, that the key to success is to do everything faster. In my opinion it's way better to take your time to do the important things and ingore the rest."
[T],matreshka4u,2012-09-24T16:56Z,"it depends on what is more important for you. if you are lucky to have a good job giving you enough money, so you may do important things and ignore the rest. however, if you are bored at work and becoming alive only when you are at home with your hobby not giving you any money, it's another case. probably sometimes it's better to do things faster)"
