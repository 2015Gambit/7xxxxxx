Check http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1414374/releaseinfo#akas will show you why imdb uses 2010. Imdb would use the first date that the movie became available to the general public. In my opinion they are correct and the date should be 2010 as should the original title of ""Sophie"". Just who are America to change what Canada calls or dates a movie. It is their movie after all not America's."
