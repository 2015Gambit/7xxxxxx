              What the hell to write here...
      SIX consists of only two members, two childhood
       friends who started this sarcastic punk-metal
               project already around 1983. 
  La Sociedad Me Matan was written in -87, but we decided to
 give it another try in 2009 and rewrote the text and recorded
  it again. A wery poor recording equipment resulted in a bad
           sound. But I did my best remastering it.
  Peddofil Butcher was finished in 2012 with a little better
  sound. Peddofil is a new word meaning Priest or leader of a 
        religious sect. (In some cases a Politician).
