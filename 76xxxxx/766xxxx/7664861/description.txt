HAS ALL THE SAVEGAMES....INCLUDING THE 100% COMPLETION AND IS DONE WITHOUT CHEATS...


Using GTA San Andreas save game: 

1. Download one of GTA San Andreas saves.

2. Uzip file using WinZip or the other similar software.

3. File GTASAsf1.b put in your "GTA San Andreas User Files" folder which should be in your documents folder (for example: "C:Documents and SettingsYour NameMy Documents")

4. Start your game and load first saved game.


NOTE: if you have a brand new game installation (which means you didn't play game before using downloaded savegame), it is recommended to start the game, and exit right after the first mission starts. Do this before following the instructions above. This will create necessary files within the game save directory.
