Untamed Americas
Outside our concrete jungles, beyond the strip malls and just minutes from our own backyard is another world that is thriving, fighting and surviving. Brawny mountains, burning deserts, tangled forests and curvaceous coasts. A grizzly bear takedown of helpless elk calves in Yellowstone. Big horn sheep going head-to-head in battle. Giant Humboldt squid cannibalizing their kin. Mountain lion cubs hunting solo for the first time. The landscapes and wildlife of the Americas are savage, shrewd and stunning. These are the great outdoors, our wildest frontiers - our Untamed Americas. National Geographic`s four-hour mini-series, Untamed Americas, explores some of the greatest wildlife spectacles and against-the-odds fights for survival in the continents` mountains, deserts, coasts and forests. Narrated by actor Josh Brolin



2)  Deserts 
In the deserts of the Americas, an abundance of wildlife has developed an array of bizarre and baffling against-the-odds survival strategies. Go to the Atacama Desert along the coast of northern Peru, where Humboldt penguins raise their families in the driest place on earth. Filmed for the first time in high-speed infrared, see the tiger moth dodge millions of hungry bats emerging from caves in the Chihuahua Desert.
