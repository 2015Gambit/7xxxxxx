"I was at this show and it was truly a spiritual experience.  Of all the Other Ones shows I've heard and attended, this one was the best by far...The venue, the crowd, the overall atmosphere was so nice. A memory from the crowd I had was some female deadheads in front of me spinning and dancing around candles placed on the grassy ground."
