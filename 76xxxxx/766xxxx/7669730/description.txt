I know you want me
But caution inspires
Your tamed indifference
Won't challenge me
Could it, could it be
Love's what you deny me?
This spoiled seduction
Intoxicates thee,
So balanced on my halo
You long secretly
Could it, could it be
Love's what you deny me?
Don't deny yourself
'Cause I know what you want
You can't deny me
We'll be together
So try to run, love
But you won't get away
Could it, could it be
Love's what you deny me ...
