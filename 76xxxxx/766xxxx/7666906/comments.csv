,LochDhueDude,2012-09-24T09:06Z,I'd love to have the ISO of the entire SACD or at least the SACD tracks ripped to flac.
,Flac2496,2012-09-24T15:46Z,"Hey cybergodsig,

Just wanted to say THANK YOU! for all your super high sound quality uploads.  Please do ignore the dorks here but do keep doing your great community service.  With Demonoid out for the count, you are almost single handedly keeping the high end sound quality flacs coming.  I hope more will join in this here.  24-96, DVD-A, SACD rips, etc are all very welcome and especially your knowledge of which issues are the best sounding to your ears.  That is priceless info to have with so many lousy re-issues out there these days.

I did look through your previous uploads to check on what styx said.  About 95% of your uploads are seeded by 2 or more people now, most many more.  I did want to ask if you could go back and do fully seed the MFSL high end torrent and the Creedence ones until others can take over.  Keep up the great work!"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-24T19:55Z,I'll post all my CCR

Anyway, thanks for sharing. You've uploaded a TON of awesome stuff and I appreciate it. Rock on."
