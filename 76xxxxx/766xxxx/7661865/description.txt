From the Booker PrizeΓÇôwinning author of The White Tiger, a stunning novel of greed and murder in contemporary Mumbai. 
 
At the heart of this novel are two equally compelling men, poised for a showdown. Real estate developer Dharmen Shah rose from nothing to create an empire and hopes to seal his legacy with a luxury building named the Shanghai. Larger-than-life Shah is a dangerous man to refuse. But he meets his match in retired schoolteacher Masterji. Shah offers a generous buyout to Masterji and his neighbors in a once respectable, now crumbling apartment building on whose site ShahΓÇÖs high-rise would be built. They canΓÇÖt believe their good fortune. Except, that is, for Masterji, who refuses to abandon the building he has long called home. As the demolition deadline looms, desires mount; neighbors become enemies, and acquaintances turn into conspirators who risk losing their humanity to score their payday. Here is a richly told, suspense-fueled story of ordinary people pushed to their limits in a place that knows none: the new India as only Aravind Adiga could exploreΓÇöand exposeΓÇöit.

ΓÇ£Brilliant. . . . If you loved the movie Slumdog Millionaire, you will inhale the novel Last Man in Tower. AdigaΓÇÖs second novel is even better than the superb White Tiger. . . . First-rate. . . . You simply do not realize how anemic most contemporary fiction is until you read AdigaΓÇÖs muscular prose. His plots donΓÇÖt unwind, they surge.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöUSA Today

ΓÇ£Provocative and decadent. . . . The kind of novel thatΓÇÖs so richly insightful . . . itΓÇÖs hard to know where to begin singing its praises. . . . Vain, shrewd and stubborn, [Masterji] is one of the most delightfully contradictory characters to appear in recent fiction.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöThe Washington Post

ΓÇ£Masterful. . . . With this gripping, amusing glimpse into the contradictions and perils of modern India, Adiga cements his reputation as the preeminent chronicler of his countryΓÇÖs messy present.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöNewsweek
 
ΓÇ£Adiga has written the story of a New India. . . . This funny and poignant story is multidimensional, layered with many engaging stories and characters.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöThe Seattle Times

ΓÇ£A rare achievement. . . . Adiga captures with heartbreaking authenticity the real struggle in Indian cities, which is for dignity. A funny yet deeply melancholic work, Last Man in Tower is a brilliant, and remarkably mature, second novel.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöThe Economist
 
ΓÇ£With wit and observation, Adiga gives readers a well-rounded portrait of Mumbai in all of its teeming, bleating, inefficient glory. . . . Like any good novelist, AdigaΓÇÖs story lingers because it nestles in the heart and the head.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöChristian Science Monitor 
 
ΓÇ£Last Man in Tower is a nuanced study of human nature in all of its complexity and mystery. (It is also humane and funny.) Nothing is quite as it seems in the novel, which makes for surprises both pleasant and disturbing.ΓÇ¥ 
ΓÇöPittsburgh Post-Gazette
 
ΓÇ£Adiga populates his fiction with characters from all parts of IndiaΓÇÖs contemporary social spectrum, and the intensity of his anger at aspects of modern India is modulated by his impish wit.ΓÇ¥
