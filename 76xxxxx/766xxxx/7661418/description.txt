
As good mods, the Jam always had a healthy respect for R&B and soul -- even the first album featured the revved-up Northern soul of "Non-Stop Dancing." 
With The Gift, however, Paul Weller seems to have become completely absorbed in it, and more specifically, in Stax-style soul with more than a hint of psychedelia à la "Psychedelic Shack." An uneven album marked by overindulgences like the instrumental "Circus" and unnecessarily long songs, The Gift still has no shortage of terrific songs, like the simply sublime "Ghost," "Town Called Malice" (the hit), and the funk workout of "Precious." Weller can obviously do "soulful" -- his voice has never sounded better -- but unfortunately, 
The Gift, with its excesses and marginal tracks, doesn't show his talents in the proper light. Points for ambition, but ultimately, this is their least consistent effort since This Is the Modern World. (AMG)





Paul Weller, before forming the Style Council and eventually going on to a solo career, was the singer/songwriter/guitarist for this influential mod/punk trio that was enormously successful in their native England but never really hit it off in the States. As their albums progressed, Weller began moving the band further away from straight punk and into more R&B-flavored territory. Here are the ultimate fruits of that transformation.

Along with the influence of Motown ("Town Called Malice"), this album also includes tasteful nods to disco ("Precious"), along with a more mod/punk call to their ealier days ("Just Who Is the Five O'Clock Hero"), an interesting instrumental track ("Circus)" and catchy numbers like "Happy Together" and "Ghosts." Further evidence of experimentation is evident on the dancey "Trans-Global Express" and the use of steel drums on "Planner's Dream Gone Wrong."

Unfortunately, Weller disbanded the group soon afterwards, but in a way it's a good thing -- quitting at their peak was the classiest thing these guys could have done. (Customer from Amazon)
