,Lobuno,2012-09-23T18:06Z,"Thanks.
Works with RELOADED release???"
[T],Sunblock.,2012-09-23T18:11Z,It looks like you need to start  Torchlight2_steam.exe (1.11.5.1) other is Torchlight2.exe (1.10.2.2). And will NOT load old savedgames :(. Before updateing.
[T],Sunblock.,2012-09-23T18:12Z,I think so. Lobuno
,DiggerNicks,2012-09-23T18:27Z,Says its version 1.10.2.2 not 1.11.5.1/3
,DiggerNicks,2012-09-23T18:30Z,"I see, the 1.10.2.2.exe works with old save games, the Steam one however does not.
Working with RELOADED release."
,nocturnalgod,2012-09-23T18:42Z,is the torrent safe?
,DiggerNicks,2012-09-23T18:48Z,"I got it to load the old save file.
First fix the corrupted save file with this.
http://forums.runicgames.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=35698&p=322365#p322365

After starting the Torchlight2_Steam.exe and making a new character, exit the game, and go to 
Documents/My Games/Runic Games/Documents/My Games/Runic Games/Torchlight 2/Save/

There should now be 2 folders named with strings of numbers
Copy the content of the folder containing your old character into the new one and once you start your game it should be available there for you to load."
,BackDaFuckup,2012-09-23T18:52Z,does this fix the ati gfx card issue in the intro sequence with the sound hacking?

,Torchlight,2012-09-23T22:31Z,Why is reloaded/theta so obsessed with these installers nowadays?
,lolindir356,2012-09-24T19:19Z,"hi, theta has released 1.11.5.3 update"
,DoEds07,2012-09-25T16:52Z,v1.11.5.3 was announced but I can't find it here at TPB. :(
,MrTTAO,2012-09-26T11:33Z,"This was uploaded on 2012-09-23 and claims to be v1.11.5.1
On 2012-09-23 v1.11.2.3 was released.
As of 2012-09-26 v1.11.2.3 is still the latest version."
,FatBoxx,2012-09-26T22:15Z,"First of all AVG goes nuts over this file, so I disabled AVG, but when I go to install it says it's not even a valid Win32 file... Wtf? This file is fishy as hell"
,XilE-,2012-09-27T16:44Z,If you people are looking for a way to play multiplayer with thousands just install Tunngle there are a few thousand on there playing TL2 all the time.
,bitchymaviss,2012-09-27T23:15Z,"This is the worst crack I've ever dled, the installer is fucking terrible, for starters it defaults the folder as ""Torchlight 2"" when it should be 'Torchlight II"" then even after picking the proper destination folder it creates a new 'Torchlight 2' folder, and you have to manually move everything itno the right folder. 

All that and it still doesn't work properly, it displays the wrong version and you claim is actually the 1.11.5.1 version yet when I try to play with person using that version I'm given the wrong version error. Fuck THETA never heard of you before today, wish it stayed that way. Absoultely terrible I'll wait for Skidrow or Reloaded cause this is absoulte shit."
,sixbynine,2012-10-01T04:37Z,"My items in the shared stash disappear once I quit a game to switch to a different character, or even just to reload. Does anyone have that problem?"
,s1raz1,2012-10-01T07:36Z,"yea, updating ur game might make ur saves corrupt and shared bank banish, its best to patch it only if u have troubles, if not, avoid it.
read runic forums.
Game not patched work fine for me, beside intro stuttering no issue whatsoever. Ill wait a while b4 patching."
