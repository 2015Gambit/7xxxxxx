,arcimed,2012-09-27T03:03Z,Thank you Malestrom for all that you've done over the years. 
,arcimed,2012-09-27T03:05Z,It seems that this torrent is stuck with about 20 people maxed-out and stuck at 13%.  Are there any 100% seeders out there?  It would be a shame if this knowledge is lost or locked away.

My friend,it took me 3 months to download this from 1 seeder.This was currently on Demonoid and I managed to grab it before Demonoid vanished.There is no similar torrent on the Web.So because my speed is only 120 kb/s on upload I seed when I can (I share my connection,so I can't seed constantly due to bandwidth ) and everybody has to be a little patient and seed to their maximum."

That was an epic save from Demonoid.  So much was lost when it went down, and I thank you for seeding it, and again, for all you've done.  Will seed.  "
