Monpura has made a huge hype before its release. its story is based on a rural scenario. ΓÇ£A heart breaking storyΓÇ¥-said by popular actor, director Afjal hossain. ItsΓÇÖ very unusual and nice songs also set the background of a heart breaking story. Gias uddin salim has chosen the huge rural scenario for making his debut and long dreamed movie.

The songs are fabulous. ΓÇÖsonai hai hayreΓÇÖ a song written by Gias uddin salim and music collected from mymensing gitika, tells a sad story. it tells a story of death of a daughter whose funeral is attended by her father and father in law.
Another very nice song ΓÇÿAge jodi jantamΓÇÖ lyrics and music by krishnokoli islam also tells a story of broken heart. it tells that story of leaving house of a girl and then her story of regret.

Another song is ΓÇÿSonar Moina PakhiΓÇÖ lyrics and music by Osman Khan,sung by arnob- also express the desire to see the loving one at any cost. it expresses it deepest desire by saying that he wants to see his loving one at least once even if it comes before his death.

So the story of monpura is perhaps a story of relations of heart and the story of breaking it. There is a big difference in Gias Uddin SalimΓÇÖs Monpura from other bangla ΓÇÿpopularΓÇÖMonpura has been taken from the rural scenario of Bangladesh. the huge rural panorama can be the backdrop of manybut this is, unfortunately, not the case.
