,ThothMer,2012-09-27T07:36Z,"Fine quality for my system, no complaints. Played on VLC. Subtitles were already active though it did seem like I had the option to turn them off if I wanted.  I'm not seeing a specific subtitles file in the folder though - then again I'm no pc wizard.

Only known issue happened both after initial play, and again when I checked for it:  Letting the movie play to the very end, VLC locks (?) meaning I can't turn it off, or start another video, or go back to the middle of this movie or anything.  My VLC is set to replay, and this didn't happen with this movie.  I have no idea what causes this, nor if it is a serious issue.  I figure if I turn VLC off before the movie after credits and final scene then it won't be an issue.  But if I don't stop playback before the end, I have to reboot to get VLC going again.  Had to reboot both times, as Task Manager didn't recognize that VLC was still running.  Hope this is all clear and helps.  If anyone knows what's causing this and wants to educate me as to how to fix it, I'd appreciate that.  Thanks to the uploader.  Probably the best Marvel Movie I've seen so far.  Much Peace"
