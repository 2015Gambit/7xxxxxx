Chicago producer Mr. International (also known as INTLMC) has joined forces with The DJBooth to release his brand new The International BeatTape. The 15-track tape was completed shortly after a life-changing period in the skilled beatmaker's life, which included the passing of his grandfather and his relocation to Germany (where he currently resides). The sample-free project, which comes with 5 Booth-exclusive bonus tracks, is dedicated to INTLMC's late grandfather, in honor of the impact that his musical influence played on the production style that International practices today.
