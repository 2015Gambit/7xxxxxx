Synopsis - A documentary on the modeling industry's 'supply chain' between Siberia, Japan, and 
the U.S., told through the experiences of the scouts, agencies, and a 13-year-old model.

I take absolutely NO credit for this torrent what so ever. I didn't rip it or encode it. A family member 
was lookng for this film. I found it on a public file server. Since any copy I happened to find of this 
film were fake, I decided to upload this for others to have. I can't be the only person looking for this. 

My opinion on this film is that it's messed up but a raw realistic look at this industry. Not at all 
what I was expecting.

Please seed! And remember, sharing is caring!!!
