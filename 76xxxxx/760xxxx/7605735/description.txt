Give the young learner in your life the wonderful gift of knowledge. The Britannica Discovery Library is a charming, lavishly illustrated, 12-volume set of "concepts and values" books specifically created for young learners ages 3 - 6. Children are introduced to various texts and genres, including rhymes, narratives, puzzles, and riddles. Key vocabulary words are highlighted throughout and defined at the back of each volume. The set is ideal for pre-readers and early readers as each volume contains activities to build thinking and comprehension skills and a glossary to build language skills.
