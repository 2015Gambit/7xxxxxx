,TryD3nt,2012-09-06T23:07Z,"scratch that. problem solved. but seriously, seed this. I mean, come on, like, ya know and stuff"
,TryD3nt,2012-09-07T01:08Z,"One more thing: I'm using initial seeding, so if you wanna be a leech... well you can't be. You could try, but you will fail or just have to give up on the torrent."
