Here are the 9 dvds of The Comic Strip Presents that are floating around on here (and elsewhere) encoded into mkv, using handbrake. There are chapter selections on each episode. I could not get the retrospective to rip. I tried... a lot. 

If you have a problem, tell it to the mountains because I'm not going to read the comments.

Keep this seeding, I will not be seeding it forever.
