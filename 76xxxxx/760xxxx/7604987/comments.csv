since i don't trust uploading my stuff to TPB anymore cuz i'm in US and risks too high and bla bla bla...

how would you like to upload my torrents here?
you won't have to seed them, i have that covered. just need someone outside US to help out.

you could upload them on your account or i give you the password to mine. either way works.

in fact, this message could go to anybody reading this.  any takers?  non-usa members only may apply.  just download the torrent file from one of the other sites i upload to (kat, 1337x, extratorrent) and add it here at TPB.  and as i said before seeding will be taken care of."
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T10:33Z,"i think you followers wouldnt want me doing it..

I was going to add kats torremt to here but
I thought I get abused

about time TPB had a mod or somone doing that
some sort of spyder to add missing shows 
but since some are fakes.. needs someone to check them.. 

thats also the problem adding just any external torrent.

I see if I can add the mp4 now from kat
dont need account or password..
they thing is if your seeding it still your int he swarm

would be nice if TPB buys or setups up a VPN
server and offers it to the top uploaders to protect them as well.. espc if uploaders are usa sources :)
one day perhaps that way no money trail at all"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T10:42Z,"ok added.. have to see if the stats and trackers come up right now

its ashame it dont have a external tracker option like demon had"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-06T10:57Z,"gah. had to wait like half hour to read your comments.
thanks.
i'm not worried about my IP being in the swarm because it is not. a seedbox was more valuable to me than a vpn. ;D"
,clikaroo,2012-09-06T14:34Z,"The cooperation I see here leaves me feeling hopeful. BTW both you cats are my 'go to' uploaders, just sayin'. 

;) "
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T14:56Z,"but you pay for a seedbox and the coy could be forced to tell who the user is
surely theres more info to be tracked on their then a vpn with no logs and multi users?"
