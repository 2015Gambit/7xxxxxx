You can use the chainfire3d to make it work.The version release is at v1 and the company still working to make it work in all devices.It is for tegra 3 optimized most.And with chainfire3d it may play fine as other games"

My phone isn't rooted so it looks like it won't work for me!Ah sure I'll just wait it out!
Thanks for your help!"

Yep for now only for tegra devices.With chainfire is a chance to make it work in non tegra too.But the company that release the game notes that there will be a version for non tegra 3 devices too"
