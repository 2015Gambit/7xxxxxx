2JJ celebrated their move from AM to FM in 1985 (as JJJ-FM) with concerts from Sydney Harbour. If you like 'The Oils' this sundown concert is a must. I simply can't believe that nobody else cares enough to keep this torrent live. (I downloaded it in the 'Kazaa' p2p days.) I'll keep this alive part-time for a month and see what happens. Seed or it will die!

Audio is good, video is as good as it got in Oz 1985 (from master analogue tape).
