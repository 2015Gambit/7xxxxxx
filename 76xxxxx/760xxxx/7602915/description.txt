Bumps INF's mission is to see the lives of people transformed by the message of the gospel through the vehicle of Hip Hop. He will tell you his main influences are God, who purposed the plan of salvation, Jesus the Christ, the only advocate between God and man who carried the plan out even unto death, and the Holy Bible and all of the great men and woman of God who set the standards within its text. The Gospel is real, its relevant for every man, woman and child that walks this earth. Most of all its relational, whether heard through contemporary, southern gospel, jazz or Christian Hip Hop, the hearts of the people will be met.
