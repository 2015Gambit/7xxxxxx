When a man and a woman get into a car accident, their corresponding spouses go to the hospital, but trouble brews when they figure out that the two were having an affair. While they talk (and talk) about what happened between their spouses, they TOO start getting frisky with each other, and they have an affair. But then, one of their spouses wakes up from their coma.

So what you have here is a weird hybrid of the 60's swingers movie. I really did like the premise of the movie, and the lead actors are all great.
