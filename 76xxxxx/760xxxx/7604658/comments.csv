,ahnaqsh2,2012-09-09T06:09Z,"OK. Many many thanks. This is my first comment on PB. I love your work.

I live in Syria, where we neither can buy nor have enough money to buy those courses. I and a friend have downloaded all of your torrents and regularly share them with friends. I have a few on my mobile phone (video down-scaled using Free make) and watch and listen to them them on my way to work.

Many thanks. You are doing a great good."

[V],dohduhdah,2012-09-14T02:19Z,@10121984: 'the other side of history' is only available as an audio version so far. I can upload that or wait for the video version.
,10121984,2012-09-17T08:55Z,"Oh, that's terrific: If you could upload the audio version I'd appreciate it.

I've just got to say that most people wouldn't be able to afford any of  these great courses. So keep up the good work, dohduhdah."
