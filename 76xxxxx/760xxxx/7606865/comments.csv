Strange World is only 4 MB, whereas the lowest file size on the other songs is 8 MB. Seems pretty fishy to me. I'm guessing Strange World is just a YouTube rip. Still, I guess you could just grab that one song to put onto your iPod or whatever. So, not fake in that it's not real, it just hasn't been ripped from the CD."
