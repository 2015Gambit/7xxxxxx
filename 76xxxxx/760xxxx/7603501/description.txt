NOTE: Derrick's two tracks numbered 9 and 10 are marked as Disc 2, so that they become footnotes to Lierre's talk; though brief, I felt that they were not great interjections but were disruptive of the flow of her speech. They are numbered as tracks 9 and 10 so that if you wish to have them in place as they occurred within the talk, simply change them to being Disc 1 and they will fall into their actual position.
