BTW subs are too much big and unreadable."

fun movie
a:10 v:9 because it's pixelated in some scenes.

And yes, the SSA subs (mistakenly named srt) are bad (in VLC 2.0.2), both in font and in text (e.g. lowercase l instead of capital I)."
,3ntomb3d,2012-09-11T11:30Z,I've been trying to get a really good copy of this. The UL had another torrent like this but it was from two or three years back and the quality was nowhere near as good as this one. Thanks YIFY Team.
