Source: Windows 7 Ultimate sp1 x64 RTM english(us) setup

I have added Preinstallation Environment mass storage drivers for the raid folks.  It shouldn't slow anyone down enough to be too annoying.  (64-bit raid drivers for installing newer setups)

Tools used:
gimagex
Dism
directx june2010 runtimes
.net 4.5 installer (includes 4.0)
windows loader 2.1.7

(this kb list is just copied from my other torrent, but I did go through and verify the neccessity of each kb file that I actually integrated.  I just didn't re-go through them to copy the list to this file)

I have included instructions to make a usb flash drive installer of this, just use winrar or any program that can extract files from a .iso file to the usb drive when you get it all prepped.  Read the text file in this directory if you prefer this method.

I have not include kb971033 as it is the anti-piracy update.  I have been notified that it does not affect windows loader 2.1.7, but I still have not included it for good measure.

This install will be a bit slower than the normal win7ultsp1 install since it has the kb updates, directx updates, .net 4.5, and windows loader. (like 5mins longer)

KB2533552 is added after windows loader using the setupcomplete.cmd because it doesn't allow offline package addition to install.wim and I really didn't want to edit the file and screw something up.

You need to reboot at least once after installing for the windows loader to bypass the activation.

I have made it a point not to modify or customize any windows programs or settings in any way.

Enjoy :)
