,yehbebe,2012-09-10T00:34Z,"Every time i try to boot from usb the windows installer says ""no device drivers were found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click OK"" Anyone else have this issue?"
,zero1zero,2012-09-10T04:29Z,yehbebe have you tried this: when you get the error message exit back out to the welcome screen. Then move your usb drive to a different port and try it again. If the port next to the one you just used doesn't work then try a port on the back or front of your pc. I had this same problem and that's worked for me.
,Alastor203,2012-09-10T11:10Z,"""You need to reboot at least once after installing for the windows loader to bypass the activation.""

After rebooting, do I have to see any window pertaining to the bootloader? Because I havent seen anything."
,murphy78,2012-09-10T12:20Z,"No, after rebooting, you can verify that the computer is activated by right clicking on ""Computer"" on the start menu, clicking on ""Properties"" and looking down/scrolling to the Activation area.
