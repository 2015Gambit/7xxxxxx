,Stefanovics,2012-09-08T11:25Z,"piece of garbage. at first it decompress a new installer, and with it a java folder in program files that my avast clearly identifies that are a virus inside Win32 malware gen.
But i tried to install it with the decompressed installer and its RUSSIAN!!!

Fuck it, and think i am waited like 10 hours for this sh*t? "

,SS4Ricky,2012-09-09T05:15Z,"Ok, i've had a lot of trouble trying to get any of these torrents to work, this was the last one i downloaded and i finally figured it out:  

1. Follow the instructions to install, this is not just the patch or update, this is the full game with all the extras.

2. The Russian thing...yes you can change language to english with the launcher but it never saves and always reverts back to russian.  The only way to keep it in english is right click on the launcher and use the ""Run as Administrator"" option. That allowed me to play the game in english. The only thing is that you have to do it like that whenever you open the game or else it will go back to russian.

3. No viruses, that damn buddah.dll file didn't even pop up as a threat.

And thats it! Been playing it for the past couple of hours and it's been a blast.  A real game of the year contender.  Good story so far, real pretty(on a nice rig of course) and lots of action. Buy it when you get the cash."

,Gary92,2012-09-09T21:38Z,"the game is not started, i choose the launcher and run as adminsitrator mode and then nothing hapen"
,Gary92,2012-09-09T23:59Z,"i found solution, not a launcher start the game,
if you want choose language start launcher and then 
select your language, push the buton save and start 
if nothing doing go to desktop and right click Sleeping Dogs.v1.5 + 12 DLC and then run as administrator , and not returned russian language, it works for me"
,Performer81,2012-09-10T10:32Z,WTF. After installation my GPU is under 100% Load just on my desktop and i dont know why. WTF???
,TheKneeGrowsKFC,2012-09-11T14:39Z,"if you download this virus, you guys deserve it on your computer. "
,Performer81,2012-09-11T15:26Z,"Installer installs some java shit which lets your GPU run at 100% permanently. YOu have to uninstall it.
Otherwise the game runs perfectly fine
, several languages are also available."
,GuruMeditation,2012-09-12T17:05Z,"Beware! May come with maleware included.

Beginning with the second installer (the one in russian) the svchost process constantly maxed one cpu core and the GPU was constantly maxed out. Even on dormant windows dektop. Same after reboot. had to revert to an old system state, to get rid of this behavior.

Maybe someone tries to use other computers to generate bitcoins, or something. Sure smells fishy!

On the other hand the installation of Sleeping Dogs itself works fine."
,fabinhoO,2012-09-13T04:50Z,"to change the English language to open the main folder of the game and open a file named SKIDROW and change Change the language only if the game uses steam_api / steamclient to decide it.
Language = russian to Change the language only if the game uses steam_api / steamclient to decide it.
Language = english and save I have helped =)"
