DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FREE AND PAID
Voice Actions Plus is the same as the PLUS UPGRADE for Jeannie, so donΓÇÖt install both.
The paid version has a better answer service ( prioritized, faster) and should be free of advertisements. Feature-wise they are always in a head-to-head race, but in general the paid version is more stable whereas the free version is more experimental. Coming soon: Nuance speech recognition for higher accuracy in the paid version. Currently only in the paid version: ΓÇ£Listen in Background (beta)ΓÇ¥

For a refund just keep your google order id.
