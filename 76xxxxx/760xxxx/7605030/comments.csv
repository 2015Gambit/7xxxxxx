What a bad fucking movie, and during the movie I wonder what the hell you been doing for 3 years?
Worst shit I've ever seen.

Do not waste bandwidth on this crap."
,Aleksander_Nordaas,2012-09-09T14:02Z,"Hey guys, and thanks for your interest in ""Thale""! Being the director, it's of course awesome to see that you're eager getting your hands on my film. 

For three years, we poured blood, sweat and tears into this project. And that's not just an empty phrase; Shooting the film with our own pocket money, we had to. Personally, I wrote, directed, shot and edited ""Thale"", as well as building the sets from scratch - in other words, putting everything (and I mean everything) on the line giving birth to ""Thale"". 

So, first of all, I hope you guys find our efforts and years well spent. And if so, I hope you'll consider spending two minutes of your own time, and just a couple of coins, getting the film the right way. I'm not gonna repeat what you all already know about file-sharing, illegality and so on. You've heard that before, and you probably don't care. What I hope to achieve however, reaching out to you in this way, is to gain a little bit of awareness of the fact that the films you sit down to watch after school or a day's work; they're not really made by a studio-machinery, they're made by people like you. And like you, we can't just download our bread.

I'm not aiming to make anyone feel provoked, guilty or sorry for us. Only a bit more aware.

If you'd like to know how to get the DVD or Bluray, and maybe a chat with the cast and crew from ""Thale"", you're very welcome to our Facebook-page (thalemovie).

See you there instead? :)

Best wishes, Aleksander L. Nordaas"
