Really amazing TV show-  Adventure, Historical and I dare say Dan Brown got the idea for The Da Vinci Code from it...or at least they are very similar. Assassin's Creed fans- behold! Old organization, known as "Dorna" has appeared in history since the begining of time- seeking artifacts, torturing the humanity- maybe the templars are part of it? What secrets Leonardo Da Vinci have hidden centuries ago? And there's only one small group of archaeologists seeking knowlege - the "Veritas" organization. Start this adventure and follow the steps of dr Solomon Zond, his son Nikko and their team- Juliet Droil, Vincent Siminou, Calvin Banks and Maggie on the road to the ultimate truth.
