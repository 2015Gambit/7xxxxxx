Intricate designs in crops turn up in farmer's fields overnight. Although they have appeared throughout the world for many years, no one knows where they come from or why they arrive. For fifteen years, Suzanne Taylor has been part of a lively community of visionary artists, scientists, philosophers, geometers, and farmers who are drawn to England by the circles every summer. This documentary tracks her interactions with these "croppies" as they go circle-chasing, indulge in circle-analysis, and share why they are so fascinated by the phenomenon. 

The discovery of mathematical information found encoded in the crop formations is a true revelation that is astounding in its concepts and conclusions.

This is the second crop circle film made by Suzanne Taylor. The first is called "Crop Circles: Quest For Truth" [2002] directed by William Gazecki, who also directed the award-winning "WACO: The Rules of Engagement" [1997].
