,distinctive61783,2012-09-07T13:24Z,"May I ask what is the issue some are experiencing with the quality? It is encoded the same way all HD files are- down to x264 with about a 720x480 resolution. 

I will upload a larger file that is as close to the original as I can but I figured folks wanted the usual smaller file that is of decent quality as opposed to the super large one. 

But for future reference and uploads, what is the quality issue being experienced?"
,SLVRATOR,2012-09-07T14:19Z,"Some of those ppl watch there videos on HD screens (Monitors or TV's)

so 480p doesnt cut it, for me i really dont care about the video size since i ACTUALLY using a laptop from 2005 xD"
,distinctive61783,2012-09-07T15:40Z,"@SLVRATOR

Thanks for the reply. Well, I uploaded a 1080p version, (of course, the file is huge) so I guess those folks viewing on an HD monitor and all can enjoy that file as it would be what they are used to seeing."
,crutter2,2012-09-07T16:25Z,Any chance you could do the pre-show too?
,crutter2,2012-09-07T16:45Z,Any chance of the preshow?
,Alfred.Araza,2012-09-07T17:25Z,"GlowGaze Uploaded Their Version, It's Much Better Quality On Such Small Size ( Around 810 Mgb)

Thanks to distinctive anyways :D"
,polyplace,2012-09-07T18:22Z,"I dunno where the above poster is getting that the other upload is better quality. It isn't. The thing has a lower resolution and I can see how very un-HD it is. This one is the better quality

actually, the 1080 one is the best quality but that was is a really big file and a long download time"
,Debadattajash,2012-09-07T19:35Z,whats the screen resolution??
,JoelisaH,2012-09-08T19:06Z,Thank you
,signup321,2012-09-10T00:45Z,Really bad quality. Download 2HD version instead.
