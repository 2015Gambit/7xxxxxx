Inequalities by P. P. Korovkin

  In this booklet the author did not pursue the aim of presenting the
  basic properties of inequalities and made an attempt only to
  familiarize students of senior classes with some particularly
  remarkable inequalities playing an important role in various
  sections of higher mathematics and with their use for finding the
  greatest and the least values of quantities and for calculating some
  limits.  The book contains 63 problems, 35 of which are provided
  with detailed solutions, composing thus its main subject, and 28
  others are given in Sections 1.1 and 2.1, 2.3, 2.4 as exercises for
  individual training. At the end of the book the reader will find
  the solutions to the given exercises.


  The book was translated the Russian by Sergei Vrubel and was
  first published by Mir in 1975.
