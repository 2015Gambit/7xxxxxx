(When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer
rather than be handled by this dialog box)

SO, I COULD NOT MAKE IT WORK. 
Anyway, You are GOD! Thanks!! =)"
,Senryakku,2012-09-07T16:34Z,thank you so much to keep uploading these
,MAA11792,2012-09-08T12:19Z,"Howdy, your software is not functional on Windows 7 x64.

It keeps asking me to update my Internet Explorer and it's Flash version, but since they are both up to date I don't see what the issue is related to? I'll will try one more of your torrents but I have no hopes whatsoever of succeeding.

Keep it up and do please try them out on several systems before posting.^^"
,MationMac,2012-09-08T13:12Z,"@MAA11792
Just because it doesn't work on you doesn't mean it won't work on others.

Win7 x64 works fluently."
,MationMac,2012-09-08T13:44Z,"I found @MAA11792's problem.
You need to install the previous version first."

,LimpNoodl,2012-09-12T23:00Z,please fix the scenes
,sammemannen,2012-09-15T02:11Z,"This is excatly like the Trial version? What is the point with this Torrent?

Nothing is better with this one.."
,sammemannen,2012-09-15T02:14Z,Isnt this excatly like the Trial/Free version? In what way is this torrent better?
,hypnotoadtrance,2012-09-16T01:04Z,"This version unlocks the audio so you are able to broadcast with a quality greater than 48kbps mono.

It's not much, but unlocking the audio is very desirable.

I will not be uploading any further releases of Xsplit. "
,sammemannen,2012-09-16T14:49Z,"Ah I understand, thank you for your answer.

How come? Are you the only one cracking this program? Is it impossible to crack it the ""whole"" way so that you can use 1080p?

Also, when a new update comes wont we be able to use this version anymore?"
,r46u50r1n,2012-09-17T22:45Z,works ... thx 
,daveyhead,2012-09-18T11:47Z,Does it have the gamescreen option? or is that not cracked either?
