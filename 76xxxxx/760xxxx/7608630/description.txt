Warning: This crack only applies to version 1.1.1209.0601

I was too lazy to make a patcher, so just replace this Xsplit.Core.exe with the one in the instllation folder.

Instructions:

1. Install v1.1.1209.0601 of Xsplit (if it is not already installed)
2. Copy Xsplit.Core.exe to the installation directory. Overwrite the original.

Enjoy.

Note: If you're worried that I injected some sort of malicious code into this exe, you can compare the bytes with the original. They are exactly the same. I only changed the value of 1 byte from 6 to 23. It was as simple as that. xD

In regard to 1080p, Scenes, and FPS limits:

These restrictions are imposed by some other unknown method within the program. I have investigated possiblities, but none have been fruitful. Just be thankful for the audio.

===Xsplit Alternative===

If you want a free, high quality broadcaster, look up FFsplit. It's still in its early stages of development, so it doesn't have too many features, but the developers are constantly updating it.

I personally have switched to FFsplit as it performs much better on my computer.

It can be confusing to use at first, but there are easy-to-follow tutorials on their forums.
