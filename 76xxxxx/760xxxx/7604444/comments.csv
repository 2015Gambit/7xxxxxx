,DChaplain,2012-09-06T21:14Z,Are you planning to seed this torrent?
,MrPjax,2012-09-07T06:14Z,I am beginning to wonder about this one...
,MagiciansFR,2012-09-13T02:14Z,"Thank you so much for this. Since Demonoid went down, it's been hard to find lately published books and audio books. You wouldn't happen to know a good source would you? Other torrent sites pretty much suck as they throw all their books and audio books in together and you can't even filter for Sci-fi/fantasy. IRC is VERY limited and slow. Boy I miss Demonoid!"
,Uriel82,2012-09-26T12:08Z,"I hear you there. Demonoid was my best friend for audio books. Ever since it went down, I have been preparing to share my vast audio book library with Pirate Bay. I have a ton of sci-fi and horror books I will upload as soon as I get a chance."
