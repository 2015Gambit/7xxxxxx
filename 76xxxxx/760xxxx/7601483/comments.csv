,kenstrife,2012-09-05T19:09Z,thanks extremezone!!!!
,mostcool,2012-09-05T22:03Z,"The limited edition is different from the standard edition, by including extra serial code to download the limited items from EA site. So for a torrent, both versions are the same. You will need to find these limited items elsewhere. 

For this expansion, there are three extra sims3pack files to be downloaded from EA site, or elsewhere: 
(1)the registration set ""EP7RegSET.sims3pack"" ~7MB
(2) the Origin set  ""EP7OriginSET.sims3pack"" ~1.5MB
(3) the Limited set ""EP7LimitedEditionSET.sims3pack"" ~82MB "

,tamhazel,2012-09-06T00:22Z,"IF YOU’RE HAVING THE STARTUP ERROR “Service initialization failed (0x0175dcbb)”

HOW TO FIX:

1. Push Start
2. In Search Box type regedit and push ENTER
3. Open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Folder
4. Open SOFTWARE Folder
5. Find “Sims” Folder
6. Right Click and push Delete
7. REINSTALL SIMS COMPLETELY

IF “Sims” is not there, check under a Folder that starts with “Wow” it should be under there."

So Just say thanks To the Uploader and enjoy ur game. If Not? RELODED's Team Quote ....Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT....  If u can't get it to run and come here with the tendency to spam the Uploader, jeeez just go out and buy it, Have a Nice day Braindeads, and thx alot Ez"
,dhod4ever,2012-09-07T14:27Z,"1. First of all you need the BASE game ""The Sims 3""

2. If you have a MOD items or MOD programs, remove them before installing a Sims 3 expansion pack or stuff pack.

3. turn off your internet when installing a Sims 3 expansion pack or stuff pack.

4. DO NOT INSTALL THE ORIGIN! a.k.a Electronic Arts Download Manager (never ever ever ever!)

5. When cracking the Sims 3 w/ expansion and stuff pack installed, always paste the crack in ""Sims 3 BASE GAME""

Follow this instructions and call me liar if it didn't work! :))"

,narcodicts,2012-09-13T06:47Z,"I got every expansion to work without any cracks.. 
just install the base game then update. 
install each expansion(used daemon tools lite) one by one and updating when asked. Then after every expansion is installed, you remove the virtual drive from daemon tools and close daemon tools. then use poweriso and mount a virtual drive with supernatural and start game.  it shouldnt ask for a disk.. if it does then i guess this method doesnt work for u, or u have another fake drive open somewhere."
,gdhsywter,2012-09-21T10:38Z,Does this work on Mac? I keep getting the no-CD error no matter what... Any solutions? 
,MacThizzle,2012-09-27T02:16Z,"Didn't disconnect from internet! Didn't use crack! Simply mounted with Power iso and installed, using keygen in fairlight folder (and sub folders). Left game mounted, opened game and signed in when at main menu! ALL WORKS GREAT!!! Thanx for the up extremezone :)"
,MacThizzle,2012-09-27T02:23Z,"@ narcodicts
GOOD to know! I had all store boughten stuff and expansions and came into a rough time! Can't afford the 2 new ones at the moment. Used power iso to mount and install (WITHOUT CRACKS) diesel stuff and supernatural, leaving supernatural mounted with Power iso! All works great :) Good tut tho!!! 

*Users looking for a quick link to power iso???Here ya go :) ***As usual, if its the latest version, I always download from manufacturer site and just use serials, hope this helps someone***

They have released an update to fix spawning zombies if you save a game on a full moon night! I recommend you DO NOT download this update as of yet as I have not tried it and seen if it breaks playback of game mounted with power iso! Will let you know when I update if all is still well! That is the only thing I believe the update was to ""FIX""... JUST DONT SAVE DURING A FULL MOON :) "
