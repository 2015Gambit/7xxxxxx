MoMinis is proud to present - "The Funky Chicken Who Thought He Was a Ninja!"

A terrible, most unfortunate accident has happened leaving our poor chicken with chicken dementia. This funky chicken now truly believes that he is a ninja and not just any ninja - the best ninja of them all! with the greatest powers ever bestowed on ninja before. 

Our poor chicken is now on a (dangerous) ninja quest to prove to all of the other chickens that he is indeed a ninja. You can either stand by and watch this funky chicken crash into small, itsy-bitsy pieces or you can show the other chickens that we all have a ninja inside of us!.

Highlights: 
- 30 challenging levels (and we know that theyΓÇÖll be more to come). 
- Dozens mission to complete to become a ninja.
- Cool and unique graphics
