Mobile ODIN - Full firmware flashing straight from the device itself!

Mobile ODIN is the on-device firmware flasher of choice. Just throw those firmware files on your (internal or external) SD card, start Mobile ODIN and flash away.

!!! Your device must be rooted to be able to use Mobile ODIN. Check the list below to see if your device is supported !!!

If you use the EverRoot option, Mobile ODIN will root the firmware while you flash it. Checking out that new leaked firmware? No reason to lose root!
