@lee .. I had that problem and it was hard to find what you're looking for in AVI format. One of the uploaders on here advised me to download 'Freemake Video Converter', it works great, I can get anything and convert to AVI. I'm a bit of a novice so struggled a bit at first but there's a great tutorial simply called 'Freemake Video Converter Tutorial on Youtube, contributed by 'baggywandas'. "
