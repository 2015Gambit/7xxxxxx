,gercazer555,2012-09-06T13:53Z,what? lyriksz you liar! added recently! no one has had time to download!
,gercazer555,2012-09-06T14:13Z,ahoi1 look at tikasukaz filesize and status people! Now you know that this is nonsense?
,gercazer555,2012-09-06T14:35Z,ahoi1 this is nonsense! check the file size and status in tikasukaz
,pow666,2012-09-07T00:36Z,The file size is larger than the game by itself because the download includes all of the extras you get when you buy the game from GOG.com.  It's not a virus.
