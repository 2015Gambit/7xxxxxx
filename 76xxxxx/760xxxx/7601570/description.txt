Book Description

PhoneGap is AdobeΓÇÖs distribution of the free and open source framework (originally developed by Nitobi) that is now also available from the Apache Foundation as Apache CordovaΓäó. Using PhoneGap, developers can build native mobile apps using standard HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, and then deploy those apps to every leading mobile platform with little or no recoding. Up to now, though, PhoneGap was lacking complete, practical documentation. PhoneGap Essentials fills that void: ItΓÇÖs the first concise, yet complete, tutorial for succeeding with PhoneGap in real-world development.

Experienced mobile developer John M. Wargo thoroughly introduces the PhoneGap platform, explaining what it is, what it does, and how it works. He then guides you through configuring PhoneGap environmentsΓÇöcreating complete mobile appsΓÇöand building them for the Google AndroidΓäó, Samsung bada, BlackBerry┬« devices, Apple┬« iOS, SymbianΓäó OS, and Windows┬« Phone. Through realistic examples, youΓÇÖll master key PhoneGap APIs for everything from GPS to the file system, contacts to camera, device to events, and more. Wargo also demonstrates how to take full advantage of PhoneGap Build, PhoneGapΓÇÖs cloud-based packaging utility.
