This Please"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-08T07:51Z,"""Restraint"" was never released on BluRay, only as DVD (and in Europe. I can't get NTSC DVD for this title).

Second, also important ""thing"" must be repeated (read first paragraph and you will get clear picture):

""Requests must contain IMDB link. Request must contain valid reason Why do you ask for it and do not go someplace else.
Re-seed requests must contain link to specific torrent.
Any type of Requests should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
Re-seed request should contain exact time and time-zone you're in. Google. My Time Zone is CET, so do the math before.
Re-seed time-window is 1 day. If you have slow connection meaning, you cannot finish download in that time-frame, just forget about re-seeding and especially loading of old, dead torrents.
Re-seed chances are good for single torrents within one year of original day of upload.
Chances for re-seed of Pack-torrents and single TV episodes are slim to none.
In short - if I have something (and is physically present) - I would definitely re-seed.
You should just ask - nicely, in civilized and aforementioned manner, of course.
If you've done something wrong on my torrents - ever - do not bother to ask.

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my uploads; that's my call. The removal of some show and movies (both from consideration and seeding) depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs or evil or stupid comments. These decisions are my own.""
