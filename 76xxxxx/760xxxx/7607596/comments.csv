Much appreciated for the Karen Kingsbury books you uploaded for me. The amount of time and effort you must put into getting these books for us is amazing, especially if you have a day job....how much sleep do you get? :-)....you truly deserve your V.I.P Status....CHEERS!!!!"

Couple of requests if you have them - When Lightening Strikes Brrenda Novak, The Uninvited Heather Graham, The Lost Night Jayne Castle, Forged in Fire Trish McCallen, and any Nina Bruhns.

All my uploaded books are on my personal servers,I don't search the web for books so there's not too much time involved in putting together a flood"
