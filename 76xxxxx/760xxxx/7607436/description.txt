Contains All 30 Episodes in One Collection!

There is an old legend that speaks of a hidden paradise on Earth - a Paradise which only wolves can find. And while thought to have been extinct for hundreds of years, wolves indeed still walk the Earth...hidden among mankind. Now, a group of outcast wolves set out to find Paradise: Kiba, Hige, Toboe and Tsume. Each wolf is driven by their own personality and desires, but together they are pursued by humans seeking to quench their own thirst for power. A difficult and long journey lies ahead, with Paradise waiting to be found.
