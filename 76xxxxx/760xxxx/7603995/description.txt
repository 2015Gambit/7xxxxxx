For her birthday, Dave Nash buys his wife, Emma, a beautiful foreclosed 
home. Gated, serene, and surrounded by friendly neighbors, it seems too 
good to be true... and it is. Dave and Emma soon discover the walls are 
lined with bricks of heroin. Before they can leave, cartel thugs trap them 
inside. Imprisoned in their own home, Dave and Emma withstand relentless 
attacks from thugs seeking to plunder the "stash house" of its riches. As 
the deaths of innocent bystanders mount, and they come ever closer to 
losing one another, Dave decides to take matters into his own hands
