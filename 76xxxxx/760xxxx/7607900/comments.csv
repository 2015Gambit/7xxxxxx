[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-07T16:57Z,"Super1313, after a quick internet search today, I may be wrong, but I think Foolish Things has only released three albums.  I have two of the three, and am just missing their first 2002 self titled album.  So I put up a quick 2-disc discography for you. Have fun! :)"
,PooterP551,2012-09-07T18:26Z,Great work. I think I asked you before but did you find any Jahaziel albums. Thanks again
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-08T01:51Z,"PooterP551, my apologies about Jahaziel. I thought I responded already. None the less, I think Jahaziel only has two albums released. And I only have one of the two, which hardly makes for a ""discography."" That's the bad news. The good news is you can still download the album which I do have. Do a search for 2011 Year In Christian Music, specifically the 7th Bundle. There you will find his ""The Still Livin' Mixtape"" for immediate download today."
,PooterP551,2012-09-09T00:29Z,Thanks you I will do that.
