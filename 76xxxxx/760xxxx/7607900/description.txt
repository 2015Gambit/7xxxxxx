Beckah Shae is a Christian pop artist.  Her destiny was mirrored in a simple act at an early age. The little girl, who was already often called a songbird, was recorded singing, ΓÇ£Jesus Loves MeΓÇ¥ at the age of 2. BeckahΓÇÖs mother was raised in a traditional Jewish home, and her conversion to Christianity was a crucial element in guiding Beckah to her own faith and witness through music. She would need that assurance of GodΓÇÖs love in the coming years.
