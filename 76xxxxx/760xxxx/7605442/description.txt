READ NFO: 
Our previous release R5 was "fine", was not "stolen" as an incompetent nuker asserted
without any technical knowledge. For "EVERY rip you will do from sources with same LENGHT"
(also differend DVD with different audios or subtitles and region) you will have same number of frames ALWAYS, and an example with another movies was produced with tinypic.

Your JPG proves that number of frames is the same, "YOU ARE RIGHT" but "DON'T" proves the solen. If you don't know these thing waste your time to do something else... with girls or something else for example.
