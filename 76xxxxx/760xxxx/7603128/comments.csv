,xboxmodman7369,2012-09-06T18:43Z,I agree! The only people who believe his lies are IGNORANT! Just go and see Obama 2016 and if that does not open your eyes to what he is doing to this nation nothing will. The only reason he was elected in the first place is because the ignorant people who voted for him believed in his bullshit lies he fed them. It just blows me away when I see people wanting to vote for him again. This man is EVIL and wants nothing good for this country! Lets all take a stand and do what is right for OUR country by voting against this monster and elect someone who is a true American who cares about their country! 
,krdonnell,2012-09-10T20:30Z,"First off that 2016 movie, is complete lies, go read ANY unbiased review, its called Google, learn to use it, its great for fact checking. And if you actually believe any of the crap here or in that horrible movie, then you actually fell right into the GOP trap. They PUBLICLY said that there campaign strategy was propaganda, and that they weren't going to let FACT-CHECKERS run there campaign. And BTW Romney was a democrat only a few years ago, and invented ""SOCIALIZED"" health care. Its called Mass-health Google it retards. Next time do research like your supposed to before you vote please, and don't believe speeches, ads, etc, without doing your own research. Its YOUR CIVIC DUTY idiots. BTW its people like you that give America a bad name. Id rather have G. W. Bush for a 3rd term with half his IQ (so around a IQ of 12 lol) than have Romney as a president. If he wins then its ""Oh Canada..."" for me."

Though I doubt it's female uploader, Females are far more intelligent the us poor men.

Four more years please Mr. Obma, your on the right track, we just need to let the train run a little longer to get to the station."
