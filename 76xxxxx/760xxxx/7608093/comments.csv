,neon2579,2012-09-07T08:34Z,"these torrents are not working because the F*** A** feds are ruining the the file... if you dont believe me just compare your file size... I bet its not 8.14 Gb as it should be....

,neon2579,2012-09-07T09:40Z,razalgul1979 I'm sure you and many others on here have uploaded the real iso but when you download the files for some reason we are not getting all of them i'm not sure when this started but it had to be within the past 72 hours just check it for yourself you uploaded 8.14Gb but now the file is only 8.13Gb and its not just yours most others in the top 100 catagory are showing the same... not to mention I have a working copy of every title in the top 100 up until yours and they all work but when file size was compared today they are all different...
,neon2579,2012-09-07T17:46Z,"am I the only person experiencing the game working but not fully, I can play offline but in the  shop the game crashes and I can not install the game to the HDD, when I try I get to 48% and then I get an error, also what is the size of this iso for everyone else after downloading? is it really 8.14GB? if so I'm not getting that could it be something on my end with utorrent?"

[T],razalgul1979,2012-09-16T08:37Z,"@Firoz0143 
The torrent has many people downloading and seeding,if your upload is low consequently your download will be slow. Before it claims,here tracker is open and so it's easy to seed.Private trackers do not give you chance.If you download 3 or 4 games a week pleased with it is the price one pays for a good provider."
