Kneelin' Down Inside the Gate~The Great Rhyming Singers of the Bahamas (Rounder) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Though the notes claim the rhyming singers of the Bahamas were unique, it's always seemed that (like other Bahamian idioms) they may also have had links with 19th-century U.S. a cappella African-American religious music. Certainly the roots, both British and African, are similar, and the music itself equally magnificent.~John Storm Roberts (Allmusic)
