I have a problem and I need ur help again....we were in touch recently....hope u remember...u advised me on rooting and unrooting...

I'm using only ur uploads.....i've installed ur upload of Talking Tom and have also installed Talking Ben and Talking Pierre the parrot from another source...they were working fine...my kids love these apps....yesterday i installed Call Recorder..ur upload...i tested and recorded a few calls, worked fine and looks like it could be helpful in the future....today when my kids wanted to play with Tom....its not listening...all 3 apps...characters aren't listening hence not repeating...I tried closing Call Recorder, even uninstalled it....but the talking apps aren't working....what could be the problem....is it Call Recorder or could it be something else....
I even used the default android app Voice Recorder pre-installed....with Call Recorder working in background....the voice recorder app could record voices...
pls....help me out here....my kids got a little upset...'cos their talking friends aren't talking anymore....
Really looking forward for ur response...."

Hi my friend.I'm happy that you love my uploads and your kids love these too.The problem maybe is in a service that stopped.Can you try to restart your phone and see if the problem still exist?If the problem exist unistall the call recorder and see if the talking apps working.If they dont unistall them and install them again.It will work 100% then.Use them for some days.If they work fine all these days install the call recorder again and check these apps every day if they still work.Also check the options in these talking apps maybe your childs make a mistake and reduce the volume at 0."
