In the mid-90's I walked into a comic store and in the 50 cent boxes they had tons of independent comics.  I remember getting a run of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and some other SL titles along with a lot of cool oddball comics including several issues of Puma Blues (which I loved at the time and they were impossible to find.)  I must have picked out $20-$25 worth of books and while I was checking out the guy said something like ""Man, none of these are collectable.""  He then explained that they had bought a collection and kept the X-Men and Spider-man comics but put all of the 'worthless' stuff in the cheap bins.  I remember walking out thinking that the guy behind the counter was an ass, but very happy about it since I scored some great reading."

Yeah, the attitude of the CSG is one of the factors that contributed to the crash that came shortly thereafter. A crash that LCS still haven't recovered from and likely never will."
