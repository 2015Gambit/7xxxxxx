,grfam,2012-09-06T23:32Z,"it's such a crappy scenery it should be free... anyway, thank you! better this then nothing! ;)"
,jamesdude,2012-09-07T00:20Z,"well there are others which are much better, someone asked for it so i uploaded it :) thanks for the comment"
,aarque,2012-09-07T06:56Z,"I'm pretty sure the scenery IS, or at least was free. I remember going to the NMG site and thinking they sell everything from toothbrushes to car polish, oh and FSX scenery and how I was able to get Johannesburg and that other airport for nothing. It is possible I got the basic scenery at some warez site and then went to NMG to get textures or photo back round or something. No biggie, the quality sucks but where are we gonna find non-default African scenery? Right here from jamesdude so thanks (on behalf of the community since I already have it)."

,PierreB24,2012-09-07T09:16Z,"Thanks man! Can u also put Cape Town, King Shaka and Port Elizabeth up if you can "
,jamesdude,2012-09-07T10:38Z,"Hi the fsx scenery isnt free. only FS2004, the only fsx scenery that is free is Durban which is not used and it was replaced by king shaka"

,aarque,2012-09-07T14:38Z,"Ah, nice. That's what I did, got the FS9 stuff and converted it to FSX, cool then.
and 737ng dude, upload something at least as useful as what jamesdude has done. ""Test test"" doesn't count, asswipe.

And WTF do you care what people type, the section is called ""comments,"" not, ""type empty platitudes of gratefulness here."""
