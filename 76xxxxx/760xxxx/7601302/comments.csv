,imthewalrus36,2012-09-07T04:10Z,Anyone else having issues with the audio of the first 50 seconds of Broken Things? Anyone have a version where its fixed?
,poke00001,2012-09-16T18:23Z,"@ imthewalrus36    Same problem here. Audio is low in at least the first 50 secs....seems to be some other spots as well. First song gets louder and louder towards the end. Looking for a diff version. Thanks to the uploader, I know it took a little bit of work to convert and upload this. Only the first song seems to be in question.  I will seed for a while. "
