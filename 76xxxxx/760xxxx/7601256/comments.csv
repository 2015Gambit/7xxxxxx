AFG only converts 720p scene releases to XviD.  some groups like CRiMSON and OMiCRON never do 720p releases which means AFG will never release this unless another group does release a 720p version.

Folks, be sure to thank CRiMSON for this, not just pss. pss wouldn't have it available if it weren't for CRiMSON!
"
[V],psspss,2012-09-05T07:55Z,"and why doesnt crimson add to p2p?

why should they thank someone that only rips
and dont upload their work which its kinda pointless is it not.

guess with mpaa shit safer for them to let others
take the risk"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-05T08:40Z,"Gee, let me see, oh yeah, CRiMSON is not p2p... CRiMSON is a scene group and they only have to upload to the scene sites (which as far as I know is not any website on the internet - RLS sites are not scene sites, they are just RLS sites). Dude, I thought you knew this sort of stuff already.

They should thank CRiMSON because CRiMSON did the initial encoding and they did upload it to the places they are required to. If they didn't, you would not have been able to snag it from one of those RLS sites.

sceneline, TvTeam, scenebalance... those are just relay accounts. Sure, there's people behind them operating them to add the latest scene releases, but they are not affiliated with scene whatsoever other than adding torrents of the releases. Why they do not add EVERY release is something you'd have to ask them about.

I thought all that stuff was somewhat common knowledge for anyone that's been dealing with p2p for as long as you have... Something amazes me every day."
[V],psspss,2012-09-05T08:51Z,"
and you still fail to see my point.. ripping stuff and hiding somewhere is no good to the people wanting to get it to watch it..

so its people like me and our own costs and risks to spread it

anyhow.. this is my convert using his source

hes better to get one of those scene relays to upload it for him then

nothing stopping you adding the series here for people either

TNE did you not hear xpmule warning.. if the mods read someone bitching about where the source came from they will delete your account here

best to chill and SHARING IS CARING"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-05T09:56Z,"I'm not bitching about where the source came from I'm bitching about how clueless you are. You act like you're almighty at something just because there's a small crowd of XviD humpers that think you're amazing when it's apparent to me you really don't know a whole lot of anything.  I could give you tons of advice (in fact I think I already have) about encoding, but since it's me saying it and we don't like each other you won't listen to it.  VIP must stand for very ignorant psspss around here on tpb.

I see your point but you don't see mine. CRiMSON is not hiding. They recorded, converted, and released. Scene goes by totally different rules than yours.  Scene has no care what p2p does and so CRiMSON will not be contacting anybody to tell them to add their releases anywhere. It's not CRiMSON's fault the people here think stuff can't be found anywhere else.

Since torrents are 99% of the time at the bottom of the spread chain, here's some suggestions for you guys n gals to take a look at if you want something a little sooner (and maybe even a little safer) than a torrent...

rlsbb . com, rlsnet . net, rlsmix . net, and other similar RLS sites.

I have no care if they delete my account. All for the better. I've already tried deleting my account here months ago. Nothing happened.  :("
[V],psspss,2012-09-05T10:32Z,"regardless is best not to keep attacking me

Im just here with good spirit I mean no harm to anyone not even the media coys but seems they and everyone all want something more then what i can give

I didnt want to share this afterall or redneck but no one uploaded and people reqyest it in any format.. but i only do xvids and i know they not as good as mp4s but ive stated my reasons for xvid quality..

since scene went 720p mp4s now media coys upset more as its what they use on their stream sites"
[V],psspss,2012-09-05T10:40Z,"its a shame scene or you havent uploaded tonights face off episode as well ://

and we dont want mods to delete you we need more reg uploaders not less

be happy dont worry about the p2p politics just share man :)"
,tibird,2012-09-05T12:35Z,you rock psspss not everyone can afford the newest equipment and rely on your xvids or we wouldnt be able to burn these to disc
,ayleycat,2012-09-05T21:38Z,please don't stop  this show. i don't understand all the technical stuff posted below but ppl like me need ppl like you to post. i seed after the d/l.
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-06T09:33Z,"@ tibird
(as if you'll ever read this but hey it's worth sharing information regarding equipment to play the updated video formats)

I am well aware many people use those old DivX certified DVD players they picked up for $40 a few years ago. I had one in every room and even bought some for family and friends.  So yes I understand how convenient XviD can be... However, XviD has died out and x264 is the new way of life.

But don't fret! It doesn't take a $500 piece of equipment to play x264 mp4 and mkv video files on your living room tv!  NO!  It only takes $50! (that's including a video cable and 16gb usb thumb drive)

Check out these HDTV Media Players:
â&#x20AC;˘Micca MPlay Digital Media Player
â&#x20AC;˘IncrediSonic Ultra Play IMP150 - HD TV Digital Mini Media Player

Those little puppies are compact, plug into the tv via composite, component, or HDMI cable, and play almost anything you can find on the internet (AVI, MOV, WMV, MPG, MP4, MKV, MP3, etc.) from a SD/SDHC flash card or USB thumb drive."
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-06T09:41Z,"@ psspss

if me trying to educate you is considered attacking then hell kid i could beat your ass all day every day.

scene did release face off.
scripted shows have priority over anything else scene releases. hold your horses for these oddball tv shows to be released that only have a small crowd following.

btw if you haven't noticed i'm done uploading to TPB.  too risky since this place is under the magnifying glass of the anti-file-sharers. sure TPB proxies tend to hide where you're uploading from since that article about top TPB uploaders and where they uploaded from gave false info about me, i'm still not going to risk it. being in the US it's even riskier. and i don't trust VPN's cuz there's always a digital trail right back to your own desktop.

i'm still uploading, tho! just not here anymore."
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T09:42Z,"i see.. but im stuck for data and i rather used data
for a show I more like.. this is just average viewing 

im surprised no one is upping here and kat this show as its appearing in other formats else where on web why dont someone else find it and upload for people :_)"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T09:45Z,"yes im on kat too.. I saw that TNE but once its upped anywhere it seems to show up on private trackers too
im sure someone will upload it to here

ive already added my convert of GH

TPB needs someone to add the missing stuff from kat to here really (like demon had ext torrents for that)"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T09:45Z,"funny how comments dont always show here as well
not until someone else posts a reply 
://"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T09:52Z,"i always listened to you.. just you seem to read to much in everything.. somethings I do my way 
and ignore other bits.. free speech people have the right to comment.. I never complained and report people having a moan or abuse... theres some that likes you and others that hate you THATS LIFE

and yeh theres good and bad vpns just have to shop about
perhaps need double or triple routing anon proxies
now

but true in usa is more risky and yes the info collected
it way wrong I know.. as I checked it too.. see other comment on that other torrent you posted too.

its silly really.. as p2p is last place anything shows up.. seems they think rippers upload to p2p

but some of us are just p2pmules like drugmules"
,tibird,2012-09-07T05:13Z,I did read it and solved my problem even cheaper than $50 I just paid $29 for nero video 11 and that burns all them new designer formats into one I can play on my living room dvd player. but I do see your point but I like psspss and felt like you were insulting him. so if i'm out of place then i'm sorry. I just dont want him to stop doing my fave shows. 
[V],psspss,2012-09-12T15:13Z,"

looks like afg is doing xvids for this now so they/he/her can take it over :)
