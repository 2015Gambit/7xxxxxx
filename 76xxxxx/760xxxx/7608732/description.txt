Calexico - Algiers

Release Date: September 10, 2012

To observe that Calexico have, on recent albums, become noticeably more stone-faced and sensibly adult might invite the question: when were they not? Well, the Arizona ensembleΓÇÖs marriage of desolate country-rock and mariachi music never pitched itself at the youth ΓÇô but there used to be blaring trumpets and daring attitude too. ΓÇÿAlgiersΓÇÖ, their seventh album, is far less surface-level appealing, but the sad twang of a pedal steel and Joey BurnsΓÇÖ rich lyrical imagery draw you in, and depth and craftsmanship is slowly revealed. ΓÇÿParaΓÇÖ might produce curious converts, if only for sounding weirdly like ΓÇÿParanoid AndroidΓÇÖ, while ΓÇÿPuertoΓÇÖ is the border-jumping highlight.
