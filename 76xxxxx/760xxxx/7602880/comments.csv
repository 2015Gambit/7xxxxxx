,ani12,2012-09-05T20:44Z,will u be doin the supernatural torrent @mf-den?
,mf-den,2012-09-05T21:21Z,"@dellefs0: This is complete, the four episodes have been divided in 2 parts ie part 1 contains episodes 1&2 whereas part 2 contains episodes 3&4 as mentioned. Also I know it says in wikipedia that it says its an hour long but that includes the ads also that comes. So this is the complete torrent. Pls read this properly where it says it will be airing only on Sept 3 & Sept 4 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(TV_miniseries)"
,mf-den,2012-09-05T21:23Z,"@ani12: Bro, I have been seeing ur posts reg supernatural for the 2nd or 3rd time, I guess. You gotta give me some time to do it, as I already have a list to upload. It is there on my to-do list, but just give me some time. I will be doing probably all the 6 or 7 seasons but I need time. Just have patience."
,mf-den,2012-09-05T21:26Z,"@ani12: Another reason is I have to make sure the other torrents don't die before even a month. So I hope u understand, don't worry will post all seasons within the 15th."
