[V],psspss,2012-09-06T09:59Z,"i think really its about eating small portions of meat
if you  still want too.. 

like mixed with stir fries.. as it was ok in the 5 percent level when they did the rats experience and
of course the chinese study

but we all now seem to eat less greens and fruits
and miss out on the micro nutrients"
