George Faith~Super Eight (Prod. Lee Perry/Reissue 2012) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Super Eight was the original Jamaican release of George Faith's more famous Island album To Be A Lover. Featuring backing vocals by The Meditations and The Diamonds, this is perhaps Lee Perry's smoothest production, a real polished gem. George Faith is a first rate crooner, even if some of his choices for covers border on cheesy. Highlights include the impassioned ''I've Got The Groove'' and the lovely ''To Be A Lover'', a cover of William Bell's ''I Forgot To Be Your Lover''. Getting your hands on a copy of this rare Jamaican issue would be great find, as it features one song that didn't make it onto the more popular Island release, ''There's A Train.''
