This is an updated Scottish Gaelic learning pack (5.89 GB).
It contains 4.09 GB of the Speaking our Language Series, a Scottish Gaelic learners television programme. The course is not complete, I have managed to find Books 2-4 (Book 1 is missing) and 28 episodes from Series 2 and 4. Other episodes are available on Youtube, but the quality there isn't that great.
File number 47 has the complete book list.
