,Drew4201,2012-09-07T02:44Z,"My apologies, if it is real.  I just didn't see a skull.  Most torrents without the skull are fake."

,GrizzlyG,2012-09-07T03:45Z," I don't know man.This looks like your first torrent. 
If this is real, thanks. 

If it is not..............."
,crowenterprises,2012-09-07T04:00Z,We all got to start somewhere ya' know? This has been recorded with a CAM and is watchable.
,CptKlink,2012-09-07T05:23Z,Well i can say its real but quality is very very poor but anyways thxs uploader
,crowenterprises,2012-09-07T05:54Z,"@CptKlink lol what else to expect from a ""CAM"" lol but it is watchable still :p do a brightness adjustment in windows media player is all good"
,xblazenx,2012-09-07T06:09Z,It's legit. It's pretty decent quality for being filmed and the audio is good. Thanks a alot!
,crowenterprises,2012-09-07T06:28Z,@xblazenx Very welcome :) Enjoy! 
,crowenterprises,2012-09-07T06:35Z,What annoys me is those other cams they ZOOM UP too darn close. So what I did was zoom but it wasn't like the others No one MISSES anything in this release because in other cams it cuts frames.
,noserave,2012-09-07T07:18Z,SEEEEEED PLZZZZZ
,GrizzlyG,2012-09-07T08:24Z,"Cool. Regardless if the quality is good or so-so, thanks."
,Movie-Man,2012-09-07T17:30Z,Is this real or fake someone give me the heads up on this torrent before I download.
,Movie-Man,2012-09-07T17:36Z,Is this fake or real someone give me the heads up before I download it.
,nycmon,2012-09-07T17:57Z,"lol people already confirmed it is real....quality is not the best but real it is^^
thanks cow"
,ihavesmellyballs,2012-09-07T17:59Z,Movie-Man are you retarded? Several people said it was real and commented on the quality.
,ihavesmellyballs,2012-09-07T17:59Z,Movie-Man are you retarded? Several people said it was real and commented on the quality. Thanks crowenterprises.
,Movie-Man,2012-09-07T18:54Z,I guess I commented a bit late...geeze sorry...
,Pmoney559,2012-09-07T19:32Z,Its definately real. Quality is descent A-7 V-6.5 very watchable
,crowenterprises,2012-09-07T22:55Z,@AddyTzu You're Welcome :)
,arman_sh,2012-09-08T02:06Z,rating?
,gyminii,2012-09-08T02:12Z,I've been waiting for this...it's the real deal folks...Thanks Uploader!!! 
,godzilla1987,2012-09-08T03:39Z,"Its real but its shaky at times, and on an angle, its watchable but I recommend waiting for a better version "
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T06:10Z,"@godzilla1987  picky lil bugga! anyway it was recorded from a CELL PHONE. Another point, u dont like cams dont record cams. Also I recorded it to where it shows the whole screen not just a section."
,Romeo92,2012-09-08T11:59Z,"@crowenterprises God, you did that with just a cellphone? that's pretty damn good quality for a whole movie. Thank mate! I've been waiting for a long time this movie hehe"
,greg442,2012-09-08T15:45Z,pretty good...thanks
,piranical,2012-09-08T18:22Z,"real but very small resolution size. quality at that size, v5.5a5"
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T19:32Z,"@piranical Resolution is fine, I recorded it the way I felt was better than most cams that zoom in and u lose some of the movie which is complete b.s. So why not do things differently. If you do not like the resolution you can zoom it on your own computer. Or why not make it into a DVD? then the resolution is just fine. "
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T19:33Z,"@Romeo92 Indeed, I have a HD recorder on my cell phone. Thank you ANDROIDS!"
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T21:48Z,In my next release I am putting a WATER MARK on the bottom. People are taking credit for my work which is VERY annoying.
,crowenterprises,2012-09-08T23:04Z,Now i'm p.oed. Guys my next release will indefinably have watermarks. You can thank those who stole my credit. 
,smokey456,2012-09-09T01:43Z,MAN I THINK U DID A HELL OF A JOB FUCK ALL WHO IS TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SOMETHING THEY DIDNT D/L. I PUT THE TWO CAM COPYS SIDE BY SIDE USEING THE VLC MEDIA PLAYER AND THE WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER AND THEY ARE THE SAME FLIX. THANKS FOR THE D/L. .CROWENTERPRISES.
,godzilla1987,2012-09-09T02:06Z,"not being picky, people want honest opinions before they waste the time to download. I was in no way saying it was crap, just I dl'd it and commented honestly. The fact that you did it from a cell phone explains everything. So relax don't get so out of joint, it is what it is, that's why were all here. Kudos to the effort"
,xsadx,2012-09-09T02:51Z,@crowenterprises no one stole anything lol. They are different file sizes witch means they took this copy and make some improvements . Stop crying about someone stealing. I mean this is TPB everything on here is shared. I think you're just butt hurt about a green getting my DL  
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T03:13Z,"I will say this, I am not crying, I just deserve the credit for doing this. My phone records HD and I choose the way I record. Now if you prefer to use a HD camcorder that can be done also. However, I took what was recorded from my phone and used it in the torrent. When I release again I will use a watermark this way no one can say it is theirs. Have a nice day."
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T03:15Z,@smokey456  You're welcome. All I can say to those idiots you do not like what I release don't DL plain and simple. 
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T03:19Z,"Also, if it was not for ME no one would have a damn copy to screw with anyway. So, like it or not you do not haft to dl what i release. If I want to I will make it where it has a license to dload to even play my next release. So keep on with your shit or ill make it even more harder to swipe shit that is not even yours to gain credit for."
,jh5637,2012-09-09T04:00Z,"@crowenterprises - Dude! WTF?! What freakin phone do you have? This is awesome for a cam made with a damn phone. Way better than other cams I've seen...and the audio is excellent for a freakin phone cam. And you're right dude..you should be given your due credit.  I'll repost this on all the current torrents for ya.

For being a cam copy:
A:8
V:8
M:6 (Hollywood has lost their grip on the whole horror genre. IMO)"
,piranical,2012-09-09T04:32Z,"@crowenterprises, if uploaders didn't constantly try to improve what is available right now, nobody would even come to tpb. getting the best stuff out there is what tpb is all about and always has been. i give you props for being the first, skull or not, just as i gave topsider props for being first with bourne legacy. if you want to put watermarks or whatever on your ups, that's your call, if the clip is fuked up by the watermark or there's an equal quality without a watermark, you're just wasting your time because people are going to go with the best available. that's why tpb is awesome."
,xsadx,2012-09-09T04:45Z,LoL i agree with piranical 
,jh5637,2012-09-09T05:57Z,"Although, to be fair, the other uploaders did re-encode their version just a bit. Be it, better lighting or a smaller file size..just saying, but hey..that's what the wonderful world of TPB is all about my friend. Just keep doing what you do and earn your coloured skull. :P"
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T08:21Z,"@jh5637 EVO 3D

I am still tweeking settings on it for next release. However I am not worrying bout shit anymore I will watermark my work, nuff said. Anyways glad you like it expect MORE from me in the future."
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T08:26Z,"@jh5637 I took this straight from my phone to where its 1 gb of course smaller size seems doable. However, lower size seems to mess with quality a bit especially a cam. Many cams zoom too far, I figure why the hell not set it to where it has the FULL screen instead of zoom where it cuts actors heads off. Yes It is annoying at times, but in circumstance shit happens whatever.  I have my own analogy which is why this shit got POPULAR so damn quick. That is the point right? To make a torrent that reaches far. Fuck the rest of the bullshit, We all have reasons to be right. As we all have reasons to be wrong. I am starting a new wave length in cams instead of bullshit zooming. Its stupid to zoom on a damn screen where it cuts the actors or scenes off. What done is done, To fix the issue I will watermark the next release and be done with the b.s. Anyway, clearing the slate by saying fuck it it is what it is. Seeing from another angle I realize why worry just be glad about how far it went. "
,crowenterprises,2012-09-09T08:32Z,"@piranical what i mean by watermark is a word at the bottom that says ""crowenterprises"" or I will have an opening scene that says it. Which ever is suitable with the program I have for coding. I have not played with coding on this one. However, I will be tweeking my settings to where it records lighter I am AIMING for a TV FORMAT quality what I mean by that is u see your tv. that good of quality, but still the theater sound. That is my GOAL, and I will start a new foundation for cams."
[V],J.R.Dobbs,2012-09-09T18:45Z,"hey crowenterprises, THANKS for getting this and shring with us. once UL'ed here, it goes all over the internet, so people that re-encode might not no you are the source. you didn;t Tag it with your nickname in title or include an NFO file with your details. also the people uploading here are not always the encoder. at least one torrent where you commented did say thx to ""original uploader"" and said source was The Possession.mp4. they were trying to thank you but didn't know who to thank. and finally, if a person that cammed a movie is so upset about other people encoding it 'their work', imagine how the people that made it feel about what you're doing, LOL :)

peace, pls go film The Campaign for us and don't watermark it, Tag It and include NFO file bro. appreciate u r effort"
,crowenterprises,2012-09-10T02:12Z,http://www.crowenterprises.net/
,piranical,2012-09-10T02:26Z,"@crowenterprises i like your new attitude man, just getting the best out there & let it do its thing. watermark, tag or nfo, in the end it's your call coz you did the work. like J.R.Dobbs said, don't sweat your work, it is most definitely appreciated. don't sweat the comments either because there are all types of spoilers as you know ie movie industry spoilers, basement crawlers, crybabies, etc. 99% of us (including those who may never comment) appreciate what you guys do coz it's guys like you that make tpb great."
,crowenterprises,2012-09-10T02:42Z,"To go with this release, I am opening the forum to contribute to the cause. Other releases through the years will be added onto the site. IF you want to moderate drop a line in the forum http://www.crowenterprises.net/"
