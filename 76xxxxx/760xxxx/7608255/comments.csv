Im sorry i havent commented on every torrent ive dled from u lately but id like u 2 kno that ive Dled every ep so far in this seasons Big Bro U.S, Aus, & UK Celeb and ive been able to do so because of u:). Big Brother is (embarrassingly) my guilty pleasure. Whenever i kno that a new ep aired i come 2 TPB & i ALWAYS find what i came for, in 10/10 quality, less than 24hrs after it airs, and its topped off with a green skull & your name every single time (most of the time you're even the ONLY ONE OFFERING ep's im searching for! I just wanted to let you kno that i was grateful for the work you do and admire the quality and speed in which u do it. thank u for making it easy 4 me to enjoy this simple pleasure in my life. "
