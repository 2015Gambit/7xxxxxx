,dhod4ever,2012-09-05T01:50Z,uhmm question. is this already compatible in Sims 3 Supernatural?
,3picL0lz,2012-09-05T12:52Z,"@dhod4ever I'm downloading it right now, but it would make sense for it to be, probably comes with it too."
,xboxuser11,2012-09-05T16:25Z,"Thanks again for this update!
Just want to know something, lot of torrent floating around about the Sims 3, and all other poster put a FIX package file, ont this biggy one torrent, don't see any FIX, any reason?!"
,xsagey,2012-09-06T06:45Z,"Just out of curiosity, I have downloaded your update from July. Is this one any different at all? Like, the old files? I am just wondering because since the Supernatural update it said to check with the person who made the custom content I have installed in my game, as some may no longer work with the patch. I just don't know what all works and what doesn't, if anything. Thanks for doing this, by the way. It's freaking awesome. :) "
,Pluup,2012-09-06T22:36Z,This torrent includes the Supernatural limited edition bonus content. Confirmed works. 
,GodWars191,2012-09-07T04:58Z,"@Pluup

I agree, this torrent has Sims 3 Supernatural Limited Edition items, a must download"
,durentis,2012-09-07T20:08Z,Glad to see you're back. Thank you for posting this. (:
,dhod4ever,2012-09-09T01:08Z,"just found some glitch when playing Supernatural.. but its playable :)
I will just temporarily remove my Mods and wait for your next month release. Thank you rachel!

PS: I noticed Rachel's not been replying in Piratebay. When Demonoid is still alive and kicking, She will always be there for any question you have. Sharing information about the Sims and interest or something like getting angry at EA for not getting her game work even though its legit."
,yoashmo,2012-09-10T19:52Z,"does anyone know why when i updated my store content from her august upload none of the new items have a description in buy mode and in game the options come up but they have no words in them.
im usually smart enough to figure this out but this had me stumped."
,NaughtyDarkAngel,2012-09-11T01:12Z,"Thank you for this wanted the Vegas Lips Couch forever! :-)

Question, some of you mentioned that this downloaded included the Supernatural limited edition bonus content... where is the peashooter? I can't find it.   "
,NaughtyDarkAngel,2012-09-11T02:41Z,Never mind... Found it... Awesome!
,dhod4ever,2012-09-11T04:07Z,"@yoashmo

remove your other custom content (Mods) except rachel's mod items. Probably the cause of that is, an outdated mod and need to be replace by a new version of that particular mod.
Wondering why you need to update your other custom content (Mods)? because every time The Sims 3 updated your old mods might result in bugs and error (speaking about compatibility) so you just need to go to the website where you download those mod and ask for a new version/fix files (or wait for it!)."
,xboxuser11,2012-09-11T13:44Z,"Can any one just confirm why this torrent don't have or maybe don't need a pack FIX? and just to be sure, to use the package instead of the sims3pack, just need to put the pachage file in the package rep? just to be sure!
Thanks in advance!"
,dhod4ever,2012-09-11T14:42Z,"@xboxuser11

I already explain this in her past august torrent (why is her store items doesn't need a fix.) and if you prefer package files just put the mods package in (My documentsThe Sims 3ModsPackages).

download and read this first:

,xboxuser11,2012-09-11T18:17Z,"@dhod4ever
Thanks for answer, I remeber you have given some clue about it, it's just my english that are really bad, and I'm trying to really understand to do not make a mess with the game .... so to good to go, I just take all the .package (I thinks rachel are at 40) then put all the 40 in ther same place that I see on your link ... (yes I have downlaoded the framework files and I also have the nointro to be sure my package folder work) so I just put the 40 pack in the same folder I have the nointro, right? without any fix, and nothing more...?"
,BDSMers,2012-09-11T23:01Z,"Thanks again to Racheal, as Demonoid has closed down her releases are being upped here, a blessing to all Sims3 ers"
,dhod4ever,2012-09-12T01:13Z,"@xboxuser11

yup! that's perfectly right! have fun! :)"
,duntrytohack,2012-09-12T11:37Z,Why doesn't my 1-19 package file show up in the pop up where they notify you of your mod scripts? Does that mean that  I don't have the store updates in my Sims 3?
,duntrytohack,2012-09-12T12:04Z,:( I hope someone can solve my problem.
,dhod4ever,2012-09-12T14:37Z,"@duntrytohack

read this first - from rachel's introduction.

Q: Why does the game tell me some of the files have mod scripts?

A: Starting in June 2011 EA/Maxis started putting 'Premium' items on the Sims Store. Unlike any common items on the store, these 'Premium' items add new functionality to the game, which EA/Maxis wrote in the form of a script, which just so happens to be the same thing the vast majority of modders will do. The scripts in packages found in this torrent originate from EA/Maxis only.

~~~So here's my comment about your problem. the pop-up that you mentioned is the Sims 3 Dashboard. The Dashboard cant read all of your package and only display what he can read within a seconds (because you have a tons of mod packages ""40+""). do not PANIC! when you are playing the Sims 3 none of the items is missing. I hope this will solve your problem! ^_^"
,duntrytohack,2012-09-12T15:25Z,"@dhod4ever

OH!! Thank you so much. I was unsure whether I had all the items. Thanks for clearing my doubts ^^!!"
,xboxuser11,2012-09-12T16:14Z,"@dhod4ever
Thanks!! I have downloaded last month the august complete store, so this time in the sept torrent, can I just download the update 40 et the sunlit tide neighborhood then just add it, or I need to re-download the complete torrent to avoid some conflict?"
,dhod4ever,2012-09-13T01:20Z,"@xboxuser11

Check if your packages or mods is currently named  v1.2.1 , if not then download the whole torrent.

but if your other mods are  v1.2.1  then don't download the complete torrent. just download the newest and add it to your mod files."
,xboxuser11,2012-09-13T13:41Z,"@dhod4ever
I have the august torrent, then if you check inside you gonna see 80% of the monthly package (1-40) are name 1.2 and the reste are 1.2.1 .... just to be sure everything will work!"
,AstroJack,2012-09-14T20:01Z,"Hey :) I just wanted to ask 2 things : 

1. does it works? and if so - how do I install it? via the monkey program? :O (cuz it's .package)

2.Am I the only one who the torrent is downloading really slowly?
I hope that it would be finished before another package would come out XD"
,yoashmo,2012-09-17T16:21Z,"@ dhod4ever

thanks for trying to help. it had nothing to do with my mods, as i check updates daily for all the mods i use. 
i eventually fixed it myself. apparently  if you originally have .package files, then install .sims3pack of the same content, then delete the .package files it will cause the object interaction options to become blank or textless.
you just need to reinstall the .sims3pack
thanks for trying to help"
,xsagey,2012-09-21T12:50Z,"Is it just me or does some of the content that used to work (windows, plants, etc.) no longer appear in game? Because I only use the content provided here and the rest of my game is base game aside from a few hair styles, and for some reason now that the Supernatural upgrade is installed a lot of the content here is missing from my game. Just wondering if anyone else has this problem. Thanks."
,Mythika,2012-09-22T16:21Z,"Hi all!

Thanks a lots for this torrent! but I have some doubts about it.

I like sims3packs mode to install the stuff, so I will use those files, but what are the 4 big .packages for?  

Thanks and sorry for my English."
,dhod4ever,2012-09-23T01:35Z,"@Mythika

the 4 big file that you mentioned is the compilation of 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 store items.

If you prefer Sims3packs then you don't need to install any .package file. Installing both Sims3packs and .package will result in duplicate items and sometimes blank icons in items with no label or names.

If you prefer .package then either use the 1-40 Monthly .package files or use the 4 Big Yearly compiled .package. 

Worlds and buildings are sims3packs and need to be install in sims 3 launcher."
,Mythika,2012-09-23T09:49Z,"@dhod4ever

Thaaaanks so much for your answer, all its clear now for me ^^. 

Really recommended!"
