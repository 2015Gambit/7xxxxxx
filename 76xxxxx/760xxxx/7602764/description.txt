Just yesterday, Peter Parker was an ordinary schoolboy, whom everybody thought a loser and a bore, but one day a miracle happened to him. Peter has been bitten by spider mutant, caused fantastic transformation with the young man. Incredibly, all senses of the boy become very acute. He takes a great strength and agility, and most importantly, the ability to climb walls and throw out strong as steel spider web! So Peter starts a new life in the form of the mysterious Spider-Man, the Savior of people and thunderstorms underworld. But where there is a superhero, sooner or later will appear a supervillain. And soon, Spider-Man will have to fight Green Goblin - the monster terrorizing the city on a flying glider. In this great battle will be decided not only their fate but the fate of thousands of residents of the city... Filmmakers made a movie idea so completely to show the inner peace of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, to show the problems each of them. Sometimes the viewer begins to understand that Peter has these same problems any more in the guise of a man than in the guise of the hero. As a result, the film is good for younger viewers, and for an adult audience.
