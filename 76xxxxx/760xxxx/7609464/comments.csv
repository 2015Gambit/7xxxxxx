MIB 3 is a very boring and unfunny movie to watch.
A huge fail, disappointing movie. "

You idiot; that is wrong..

From wikipedia: ""The film is set to be released on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on November 30, 2012."""
,steaz55,2012-09-09T16:33Z,"@okonomiyaki:

The US release is on November 30.
Australian release is on September 21.

It's being released earlier in other parts of the world. "

,OutonaLimb,2012-09-10T00:43Z,I think BTguard.com is slowing me down does anybody else use Bit torrent Proxies that have better speeds I need better options. Ever since comcast sent me that notice for downloading the UFC. I had to get BTguard so they can't peek in and see where I am downloading from. Sometimes speeds are good but many it's hit or miss
,bordo84,2012-09-10T22:06Z,i hope itÂ´s playable not only in pc but also through external hardisk on tv
,bordo84,2012-09-11T18:03Z,could somebody make bluray of silent hill in good quality like 13gb at least please? anyone? i missed it back then...and rips which are on the net yet are in bad quality when it comes to dark scenes 
,Woesaka,2012-09-13T13:43Z,"Cmon guys, i'm downloading 20kb/s and uploading 500kb/S with a ratio of 2.1/1 atm.
