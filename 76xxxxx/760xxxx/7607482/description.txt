This disc essentially spans 30 years, from the late 1960's, when the Bacharach/David team was essentially ubiquitous, until the mid-1990's, when Bacharach teamed with the English singer/songwriter Elvis Costello to produce the great song "God Give Me Strength" for the film GRACE OF MY HEART, which lead to their collaboration on the wonderful 1998 album PAINTED FROM MEMORY.
