In ""PERCEPTION"", Eric McCormack plays Dr. Daniel Pierce, an eccentric neuroscientist who uses his unique outlook and expertise to help the federal government crack difficult cases. Pierce's intimate knowledge of human behavior and masterful understanding of the mind are matched by his equally odd and imaginative view of the world. Rachel Leigh Cook co-stars as FBI agent Kate Moretti, Pierce's former student and the person responsible for recruiting him to work for the government. Arjay Smith plays Max Lewicki, Pierce's teaching assistant who has spent nine years at college. Kelly Rowan is Natalie Vincent, Pierce's best friend and every bit his intellectual equal.
