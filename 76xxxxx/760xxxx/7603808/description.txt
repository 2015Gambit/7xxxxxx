The features highlighted in the above video are as follows (as well as some that didn't make it into the video):

    Attachment system for non-weapon gear
    Added 20 gear attachment slots
    Items can be tinted using color picker
    Color picker starts at current color of seleted object
    Fixed problem with enemies drawing non-weapon items when threatened
    Item attachment only works with the attachment slots, not character bounding    boxes
