This is a 720p Hardcoded English subtitle copy of Saints and Soldiers (2003). I created this out of
personal need. And I figured I would upload it for all other people who hate it when you stream
movies within your home and the SRT files do not get picked up. 

At the beginning of the movie, the sub titles are not exact. But as the movie plays on they line up better.
This is the best I could get it. I'm new at this and even learned to use a new program for creating, editing,
 and timing subtitles. These subtitles weren ot written by me. I got them off the internet, but the timing 
was completely messed up. I got it the best I could.

Please leave feedback. And sharing is caring, so please seed. Thank you.
