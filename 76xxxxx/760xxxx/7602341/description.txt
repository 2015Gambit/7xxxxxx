This is a repack of Carenado's Beechcraft Baron B58 for FSX.

It is an installer that will place the files in their appropriate folders, or allow you to specify your own folder.

No email or serial number is required.

After install, an entry is made in Window's Installed Programs.  You can uninstall from here, or use the uninstaller in the Carenado folder inside the FSX folder.
