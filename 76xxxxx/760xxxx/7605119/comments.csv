,yyourmom,2012-09-06T17:56Z,holy shit its 44gb. Why ?? :O
,dr_mark,2012-09-06T18:13Z,This has the original disk video files.  Use Handbreak on it to compress it to one file.  Also I am now stuck at around 15%.  Not getting any seed at this point.
,barkbosse,2012-09-06T18:14Z,"Yo dawg, I heard you like torrents...."
,dr_mark,2012-09-06T18:15Z,For some of you lost right now.  Download this file and then click it.  It will open another torrent for you to download the actual movie from.  The movie is at around 44.7 gigs and a disk rip.
,stumpalump,2012-09-06T20:58Z,Same also stuck. BOZX?
