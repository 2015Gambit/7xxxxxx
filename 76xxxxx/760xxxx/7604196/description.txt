This file was ripped from YouTube and credit should go to uploader. It does contain a imposed watermark in the upper left hand corner. It is the full race commercial free.

The reason I no longer do NASCAR torrents is that no one will send them and they are usually dead after a week or two. I will NOT RESEED and REFUSE to babbysit these if others cannot contribute and will stop uploading them altogether if I continue to get hit and runs. Please seed at full speed during and after download so that others can also enjoy and be sure to check out other CARG releases.
