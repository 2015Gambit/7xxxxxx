
Odd Jobs Gin has taken on a lot of odd work in the past, and when you're a Jd and colonized by aliens, the term "Odd Jobs" means REALLY ODD jobs. But when some more than sack of All Trades agency based in a feudal Japan that's been conquerelightly suspicious secrets from the shadows of Gintoki Sakata's somewhat shady former samurai past and a new pair of odd jobs collide, the action is bound to get so wild and demented that only a feature film will do it justice!
