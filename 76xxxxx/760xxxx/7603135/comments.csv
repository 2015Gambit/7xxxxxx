I went to the site,but I can't get anything to work.

I believe you need ""Adobe Flash Player"" to view the contents"
,pir8s007,2012-09-05T22:06Z,"No, you don't understand BBS. I can view the contents. but i just wanna to download the ebook to read it offline....there are some mag with different language if you click on english version which is first from left, it start loading the emag and if you just left or right arrow button on your keyboard the pages moves......

I am able to view or read the mag online but I want to download it..... "
