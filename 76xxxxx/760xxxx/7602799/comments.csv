You will download the fifa 12 from here:

thepiratebay.se/torrent/7482946/FIFA_12_by_EA_SPORTS_v1.3.98_Final_By_bobiras2009

And then you will open wifi to download the data through the game."

Don't worry man, you're OK. Just that the app will not work as a FULL version, it will be a trial. Find another player that doesn't need root, such as PlayerPro or MortPlayer Music (FREE!).
Thanks to bobiras for all his great uploads. "
