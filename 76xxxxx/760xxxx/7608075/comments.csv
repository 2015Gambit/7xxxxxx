,cosmickc,2012-09-07T17:02Z,I was there. Great show!  Both nights.  Grab this one!
,brizownthepi,2012-09-07T23:38Z,Thanks again - glad to see the Pirate Bay more active with Dead boots!!
,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-09-09T00:44Z,"Thanks!  I'll post the 6-24 show tonight.  I tried to post on Trader's Den, but somehow I was omitting something in the fingerprints.  These shows sound every bit as good as the Dead releases posted there, which is nice.  By the way, I LOVE TRADERS DEN.  Great site!"
