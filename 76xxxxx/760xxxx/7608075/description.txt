"This one is bonafide 5 star action. The best thing about this show was that EVERYONE got in the show. There were miracles everywhere. A bunch of locals bought a bunch of tickets thinking they could sell them for $$$ - ha ha! Didn't work out that way. Garcia was visibly upset after Bob started Good Lovin, didn't want it to stop!"

Notes:
-- Complete show, no flaws, This is NOT from the liberated bootleg CD.
-- Seamless transition between discs 2 and 3.
-- This is an upgrade to all circulating copies.
-- Reuben & Cherise tease before Tennessee Jed.
