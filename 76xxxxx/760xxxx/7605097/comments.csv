this is a good ep, too.

poor Hagar (a cutie girl behind the cameras Ghost Hunters crew member) got all scratched to hell. :("
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-06T11:12Z,btw it should let you add it to the Video > TV Shows section because i changed the url file to a txt file.  had to do so in compliance with the seedbox.
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T11:18Z,"lol 

looks like add kat here worked.. of course you could make another account and do that same. 
if want to sep it from other account
but you could just tick annoymous on your current account

i didnt have to change torrent trackers with editor which I had to do with demon externals "
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T11:22Z,"i didnt spot the txt for url.. bum no biggy
mods might change it back who knows

but i think people wont see it here as the RSS
your name not mine for the mp4s

and perhaps I need to start using anon option as well
but then that stuffs up followers using feeds LOL

arr TPB needs paid for vpns for uploaders eh"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-06T11:45Z,"i wonder how many people are gonna go wtf? psspss uploading a x264 mp4?
hah!

and as for the rss feeds - that's exactly why i'm willing to give out my password to my account on here; so someone outside of usa in a ""sharing isn't a big deal country"" can take over the trialNerror TPB account.

anybody? hm? it's very easy to do! just get the .torrent file (not the video, just the .torrent file that's only about 20kb) from 1337x, kat, or extratorrent and add it to TPB as trialNerror.
"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T11:58Z,"
I think TPB adds fake 100 percent seeders to the trackers which I thought were faker seeders from antip2p
perhaps thats how they help hide the initial seeder as well??

as those reports are crazy stupid.. as if someone would be using a anon vpn in usa to seed stuff LOL"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T12:01Z,"sweetchuk might do it?

but mpaa etc will think your seeding it still and uploading stuff they wouldnt have a clue about
what external torrents mean

theres no benefit in doing it that way.. you better just to tick anon when uploading
and tell people to RSS feed the anon account??

just an idea.. in fact I should be doing that too"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-06T12:16Z,"i'll post a HELP WANTED sign on a few spots and see if there's any takers.

RSS to anonymous won't work, either. do you realize how much untrustworthy crap comes thru as anonymous uploads?

and that only makes you anonymous on the GUI end of TPB. all that fun stuff behind the user end which is just pages of scripts and codes and other mumbo jumbo that makes up a website will still know it was uploaded by you logged in on your account from whatever IP address.

maybe I should just make my account an open one so any friends can use it. that way multiple people logging in from all over the world will make it extremely difficult to track."
,xxdocxx,2012-09-06T12:54Z,"I knew that one of these days you guys would make up LOL. Great job boys keep it up. Most people don't realize the risk you take to get us these episodes, but coming from myself and im sure many others we greatly appreciate all of your efforts. Cheers"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T13:02Z,"well you know about proxy switcher pro and daily open proxies right it makes it easy and elite ones? and tor as well google januspa theres a vm one as well

you can use any of those to upload from and
nothing is logged

but yeh I know anon has crap in rss..but you could always ask someone or friend vip to post a comment saying its good in the torrent

not used tpb rss myself.. cant you filter by tag like tne? or paranormal theres always new things to learn"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T13:09Z,"doc its nothing about making up.. I always answer people or if abuse too much pay no attention to them

someone had to be a punchbag for tne :D
or soapbox.. its good to get it off his chest

it must be the starsigns we will always be back and forth

its like when your mum is talking to you but
your not paying attention and they just annoys
them as hell.. dont stop it happening again
they just frustrated may nag a little for not listen
and go away for a bit and repeat :D"
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T14:57Z,"opps a few typos again.. getting late again
so will head off"
,peachpuppy,2012-09-06T16:32Z,Thanks dude :) Some people say you're pretty shifty but I think you're a pretty cool pirate guy actually xD
