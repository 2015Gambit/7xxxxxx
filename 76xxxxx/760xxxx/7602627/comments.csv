Thank you for the one's we've already had as well."
,swissy70,2012-09-16T20:05Z,"yes, where is nr. 5 ????? tired of only viewing the highlights on comedy..... "
,culo_mahogany,2012-09-17T03:54Z,"Donde esta The.Burn.S01E05?

Me sad-o"
[T],theburningbush,2012-09-17T23:11Z,"I don't know if will help or not, but you could add your requests for The.Burn.S01E05 to my request at forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=131002 ."
,culo_mahogany,2012-09-19T09:22Z,"While we're at it, I'd really like to see the Jeff Ross Roasts America comedy special.  It seems like roasts are being prejudiced against on the pirate scene..."
,keanereader,2012-09-20T04:52Z,"@culo_mahogany Most or all of the actual Comedy Central roasts are up on TPB though. Comedy specials are harder to come by. I'm still waiting for the Jeff Ross one, a recent Kevin Nealon one, and Amy Schumer: Mostly Sex Stuff."
,culo_mahogany,2012-09-20T20:35Z,"@keanereader I know, I just remember waiting up all night for the Roast of Roseanne (and the Charlie Sheen one before that) and it taking 2-3 days before anybody bothered to upload a copy.  Meanwhile, every other crappy show that night had been uploaded by multiple sources within hours.

*sigh* I guess I would be remiss to request The.Burn.S01E06? :P"
[T],theburningbush,2012-09-20T20:51Z,"Weird.

The.Burn.S01E01-E04 were all UL'd in a relatively timely manner.

But now it seems we're destined to never see The.Burn.S01E05 or The.Burn.S01E06, the final two eps of the season.

Weird."

I think it's something to do with Comedy Central in general... the last few episodes of Comedy Bang Bang and Bunk also took a week or more to come out, even though they were on the CC website at some point."
,keanereader,2012-09-22T06:17Z,"Wait, never mind... CBB and Bunk and IFC shows. Probably just a roast delay like you said."
,culo_mahogany,2012-09-23T22:33Z,"If it hasn't come by now, I doubt it ever will.  It obviously doesn't seem to be a popular show and the lack of torrents will only ensure that it won't catch on.  I just wish Comedy Central would stop being stingy and air the whole damn thing on their site instead of ""clips"" comprising half the show."
,culo_mahogany,2012-09-23T22:36Z,"Oh, I see why CC doesn't air shows on their site.  You can ""buy"" episodes on Amazon for $2.99 apiece.  Fuck that."
