,libertaswv,2012-09-06T23:48Z,"A Mother's Son, a two part drama from ITV,  stars Hermione Norris, Martin Clunes, Paul McGann, Alexander Arnold, and Nicola Walker. 

When a teenage schoolgirl is murdered in a quiet coastal town, the residents are shocked. They include the newly-merged family of Rosie and her two children Jamie and Livvy, and her new husband Ben and his two teenage children Rob and Jess. Then Rosie find a pair of trainers stained with what she suspects could be blood. With Jamie and Rob both acting suspiciously, could someone in the family really be involved in the murder?

Saw the eng subs @ uksubtitles.ru, but they're probably on addic7ed by now as well.

Thanks a bunch, TvTeam - Dunno what i'd do without your relentless work. Always genuinely appreciated (that goes for all seeders and leechers as well!)"
