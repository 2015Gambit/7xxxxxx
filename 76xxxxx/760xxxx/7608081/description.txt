Troll 3 (also known as Creepers, Contamination .7, Troll III: Contamination Point 7, or The Crawlers) is a 1993 Italian horror film directed by Joe D'Amato and Fabrizio Laurenti.
Like Troll 2, Troll 3 has no plot connection to the original Troll, features no trolls, and is also a horror film, not fantasy-comedy. The film has none of the original cast, nor storyline continuation, from either Troll film. An early script was made with the original cast in mind. In one scene in a bar, a banjo centric song from Troll 2 can be heard in the background.

Enjoy this marvellous piece of shit, everyone!
