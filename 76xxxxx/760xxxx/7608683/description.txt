Album Description:

The 3.2.94 show from The Masquerade Nightclub in Tampa, FL (the historic Rivoli then Ritz Theatre, now the Ritz Ybor) is the band's first performance at the venue during their first tour dates in Florida. DMB received a great reception from the audience. 

Highlights of the show include a classic Warehouse with supporting vocals from Carter and, as always, one-of-a-kind playing from LeRoi. Hard hitters from the show include Tripping Billies, Pay For What You Get and a solid rendition of Help Myself. Minarets features Carter and DaveΓÇÖs scatting intro and ends with its typical feverish finish with a segue into Typical Situation. What Would You Say is funky and tight and keeps the crowd hollering. Ants ends the show with a rousing finish. The 3.2.94 show has been digitally mastered and is available in its entirety. 

Enjoy.
Seed.
