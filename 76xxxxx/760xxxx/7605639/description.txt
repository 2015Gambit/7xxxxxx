What's in this version:
WEATHER PROBLEM FIXED!
Google recently closed their 'unofficial' weather service. This caught me unprepared, so I had to scramble to find a replacement weather service.
As a result, I've now changed the widgets to use World Weather Online for getting weather data.
v2.2.1 Some small bug fixes. Thanks for the bug reports!
