Hey hey! We are currently working to get Minecraft 1.4 out around Halloween ΓÇô the Pretty Scary Update! Until then, have the (near-)weekly snapshot, 12w36a:

1)A new scary decoration block
2)The "secret" from previous snapshots is now spawnable
3)A new mob variant in the Nether
4)Minor changes to the leather dyeing (the colors will attempt to maintain intensity and not dilute as much)
5)The "work in progress block" is now called "Beacon" and can be crafted
6)Carrot on a stick!
7)Bug fixes
