,Darkdragontc,2012-09-19T07:21Z,It's about to expire.... i think they fixed this problem
,Cosmic_Rocker,2012-09-24T08:53Z,This version of SAM messes up for me just like 4.9.2 did.  I've been using 4.9.1 and it works great and I was excited to Update to 4.9.7 but when I did so and ran the Loader as Admin SAM responded as described.  But when I ran the program it said my trial has expired.  But when you press Config and go to registration it said Active and Registered.  OK so I decided to go on the air and the first track plays and after that the program crashes.  I then went back to 4.9.1 and no issues.
,Darkdragontc,2012-09-24T17:58Z,"I'm back 4.9.0 ... 4.9.1 has the bug you can't delete anything off the music track.

i still have this one as of now and it's ok so far for me."
,MrCabana,2012-09-28T04:24Z,Didn't work on my Windows 8 Enterprise RTM x64. It pops up a message saying the app has crashed and in the end the loader says no files could be found.
