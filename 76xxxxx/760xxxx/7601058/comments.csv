p.s. to everyone: the ""anonymous download"" option is a bunch of hoo-hockey that secretly adds a bunch of bullshit to your toolbar that you can't readily get rid of. Don't know where it comes from but its new and on pretty much every torrent now.... luckily I was informed before having to learn the hard way and I'm paying it forward. lol."
