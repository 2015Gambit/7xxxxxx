Quickly toggle settings and radios from the Notification drop down panel.
Never leave an app to toggle settings again! Configure which toggles you want available. Configure which toggles you want via Preferences (open TogglePanel from your launcher / apps list).

TogglePanel currently supports toggling

    Airplane Mode
    Wifi Radio
    3G Radio
    Bluetooth Radio
    GPS (*)
    Background Sync
    Autobrightness / Manual brightness levels
    Autorotation (accelerometer)
    Ringer

Data toggle added, will continue to improve it (add 2G / 4G mode toggles as well). If you have any issues with the data toggle, please send feedback to support@seifsoft.com thanks. Keep the feedback coming!

What's in this version : (Updated : Jul 23, 2012)

    Added preference to set Notification Priority (MAX will try to keep TogglePanel at the top of the Notification list, MIN will hide the icon from the status bar, sorry, but I haven't found a way to do both at the same time yet)
    Fixed Jelly Bean notification sizing.
    Working on expanded notifications for Jelly Bean
    Will be adding more toggles based on your feedback in the near future.

Required Android O/S : 4.0+
