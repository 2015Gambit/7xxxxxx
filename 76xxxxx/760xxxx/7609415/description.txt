My Player Database for FM12,the latest Moskollo DB is updated to include transfers upto and including 7/9/12(up to bently to Russia). This is just the database so should be a quick download.

I've done as many transfers as I can, I do focus on the English leagues on my games, will seed for as long as possible.

Put the moskollo DB files into your 'my documents/sportsmanager 2012/editor data folder and then when starting a new game select moskollo db.


Peace and enjoy,
