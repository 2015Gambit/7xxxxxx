This is a pretty cool collection of stuff I found on the internet over the last couple years.  Most of it is from the 60's, and the rest from the 70's.

1.  Muddy Waters 1964 (16:28) - This is live for a British TV show called The Blues & Gospel Train.  It's B&W. There are also a couple songs from a black, female singer/blues guitarist.

2.  Muddy Waters 1971 + Newport Jazz Festival (58:28) - This one is really good!  The 1971 stuff is in color, and the 5 songs from 1960 Jazz Festival are awesome!  For more info, click on this:  https://www.burningshed.com/store/snapper/product/334/1831/

3.  Two CD's from 11/22/81:  This is one of Muddy's last performances before he died.  It was recorded at the Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago the night before the Rolling Stones did a three night gig.  Buddy Guy also shows up.

4.  Muddy Waters Canadian TV 1966 (13:24) - This is a live B&W TV performance.  There are also a couple other bluesmen, including Willie Dixon.


Please seed as long as possible and help keep this historical record of one of the all-time blues greats alive!
