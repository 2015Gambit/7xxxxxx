Algebraic Equations of Arbitrary Degrees by A. G. Kurosh.

This booklet is a revision of the author's lecture to high school students taking part in the Mathematics Olympiad at Moscow State University. It gives a review of the results and methods of the general theory of algebraic equations with due regard for the level of knowledge of its readers. No proofs are included in the text since this would have required copying almost half of a university textbook on higher algebra. Despite such an approach, this booklet does not make for light reading. Even a popular mathematics book calls for the reader's concentration, thorough consideration of all the definitions and statements; check of calculations in all the examples, application of the methods described to his own examples, etc.

The book was translated from the Russian by Vitaly Kisin and was first published by Mir in 1977.
