They perhaps took themselves too seriously sometimes (and maybe at other times should have been a little bit more serious), but the fact remains that the Eagles were one of the most memorable singles bands of the 1970s, and their influence, particularly on several new country acts, continues to grow with the passing of time and trends. This 13-track collection hits the obvious high points and includes such classics as the gleefully wry "Take It Easy," the wonderfully written "Lyin' Eyes," and the pop gem "New Kid in Town."
