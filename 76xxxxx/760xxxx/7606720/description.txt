This is a collection of Youtube videos that I found about flexible weapons and sarong fighting.

I was disappointed that I could not find any torrents on this information so I thought I should make my own.

If anyone owns The Cold Steel Fighting Sarong dvd I would really appreciate them or any other of the flexible weapons dvds mentioned in this collection. I've been trying to get the fighting sarong dvds but I can only get 54% on the torrent I found :(
