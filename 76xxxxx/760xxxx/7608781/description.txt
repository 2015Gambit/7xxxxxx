DESCRIPTION: Self-Esteem, a strange tale of the meltdown of a man who has profited from telling others how to live, is both a thriller and social satire that raises disturbing questions about the effects of popular psychology on the world. Successful self-help writer Dr. James Crawford is not happy. Crawford's professional success is greater than ever but his personal life is falling apart. He has endorsed a children?s TV show based on his writings, but the cartoon-like host could be up to no less than murder. During a nasty drinking binge, Crawford struggles with his wife and son and his son?s strange mentor, a popular talk show host, a business partner tired of Crawford's aspirations, a mistress who doesn?t understand him, an emotionally distant professor, a couple of college pranksters, a successful rap artist, and an ominous tormentor -- all of whom seem to be pushing the famous guru toward emotional destruction. Self-Esteem is a dark and earthy satire on vacuous "self help" culture with a careening air of inevitable catastrophe. It's juicy, dirty, thought-provoking and disturbingly hilarious.
