,gercazer555,2012-09-06T14:02Z,"Dear lyriksz, Why did you leave me a bad review, but here is good? it is very suspicious!"
,pow666,2012-09-06T18:50Z,Shame this isn't the GOG version.  Would be much better if it were. :-/
,pow666,2012-09-06T18:56Z,Never mind it is the GOG version.  Thanks for the upload!
,pow666,2012-09-06T23:14Z,"No virus, the reason it's bigger than the game normally is, is because it includes all of the extras you get when you buy it from GOG.com.  I scanned multiple times with Kaspersky and everything came up clean.  I repeat THIS IS NOT A VIRUS."
,alfaromeo1991,2012-09-07T07:06Z,"erm.. right after i install the game there a svchost.exe hogging my cpu and cause a huge slow down on my comp (located in C:Program FilesJava) i renamed the file and tried reinstalling java see if it installed by java but no

well it might be coincidence but... heh... nvm..."
,GATOQSECOMIO,2012-09-07T21:32Z,"como se cambia el idioma?


how to change the language?"
,GATOQSECOMIO,2012-09-07T23:57Z,no esta en espa単ol
,Polyneikes,2012-09-08T14:05Z,"i got the same problem with alfaromeo1991 after installing, explorer.exe using more cpu than normal and lag. i unistalled java then deleted the svchost.exe from the java and unistalled the game folders problem fixed.

 i installed again the game, and got the same problem.....i suggest the skidrow version"
,MrTTAO,2012-09-09T02:12Z,"If you are worried this is a virus then get the skidrow version from the trusted sources here on TPB which is just the GOG installer packed in an ISO with an icon and an autoexec.ini file.

However, first get this for the manuals which are NOT included in the skidrow version."
,lyriksz,2012-09-09T13:11Z,game work ok
