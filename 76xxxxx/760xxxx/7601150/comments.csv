On a side note, it's pretty pathetic that there are now 750 seeders and none of you assholes could take 5 seconds and say thanks."

,blackchap,2012-09-05T23:57Z,Thanks for the upload
,CrossCrucial,2012-09-06T02:47Z,"@GanjaGuy420 - I've watched all these hard knocks rips on a 42"" 1080P tv and they are fine. Some people value their time and bandwidth."
