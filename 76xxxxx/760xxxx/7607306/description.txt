Summary: This year is the yakudoshi, or “unlucky year” for 32-year old Akiko (Shinohara Ryoko), a television announcer. She lost her position in a news program to a rookie announcer. What’s worse, she is assigned to go undercover and experience life as a farmer’s bride for a variety program. Akiko pretends to be the fiancée of Ichiro (Yabe Hiroyuki), her ex-boyfriend, and begins her “bridal training” at the peach farm of Ichiro’s parents. Awaiting Akiko is a family filled with extraordinary personalities, led by the stern mother-in-law, Yukie (Iwashita Shima)
