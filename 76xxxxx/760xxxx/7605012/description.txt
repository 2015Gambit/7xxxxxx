and accordingly re-locates to Shimla to start the filming. Enroute, 
she excitedly telephones Dev and tells him of the scenic surroundings as well as the echo of bells in a tunnel 
that emanate from a hanuman mandir. 
Several days later, when he does not hear from her, he decides to travel there. 
But before he could do so, he does get her telephone call in which she sounds distressed and 
asks him to help her. When he asks about her location,
