If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: 1.6 and up
Overview: UNLOCK KEY (License) for BeyondPod Podcast Manager Application
This the UNLOCK KEY (License) for 'BeyondPod Podcast Manager' and 'BeyondPod for Honeycomb' applications.


You must have either the Phone or the Tablet version of BeyondPod installed before purchasing (to get it, search for "BeyondPod" in the Android Market).
IMPORTANT! THE UNLOCK KEY DOES NOT HAVE A HOME SCREEN ICON AND CAN NOT BE "STARTED" - IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED!
The key will be automatically installed by the Android Market application. When the installation completes it should be listed as "BeyondPod Unlock Key" in "Manage Applications" list of the device "Settings".
BeyondPod just checks if BeyondPod Unlock Key is installed and unlocks itself.

What's in this version:
A small change to make the key visible to more devices (including Google TV boxes) on Android Market. If you already have the key the upgrade is optional.
