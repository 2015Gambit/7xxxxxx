Our entire way of life depends on electricity. So what would happen if it just stopped working? Well, one day, like a switch turned off, the world is suddenly thrust back into the dark ages. Planes fall from the sky, hospitals shut down, and communication is impossible. And without any modern technology, who can tell us why? Now, 15 years later, life is back to what it once was long before the industrial revolution: families living in quiet cul-de-sacs, and when the sun goes down lanterns and candles are lit. Life is slower and sweeter. Or is it? On the fringes of small farming communities, danger lurks. And a young woman's life is dramatically changed when a local militia arrives and kills her father, who mysteriously - and unbeknownst to her - had something to do with the blackout. This brutal encounter sets her and two unlikely companions off on a daring coming-of-age journey to find answers about the past in the hopes of reclaiming the future."

Thank you for sharing!
The pilot was fine, but nothing that much."
,Smashbros,2012-09-07T03:19Z,"Video is all fucked up. All my other videos play fine, so it's this one."
,livens01,2012-09-08T17:41Z,"@Smashbros

What kind of logic is that? All your other gay but sex vids work fine so it must be this one?? Im running a 9 year old nvidia geforce fx 5600 and 'this one' plays just fine with the right codec. So it MUST be YOU."

How lucky they just happen to walk into the bar and find the person they are searching for.
Yawn, quite dreadful show."

You don't come here to chitchat about the content of the files you download, dipshit. Only comment on the quality, legitimacy and gratitude to the uploader! Maybe a general statement about the show is ok but most people reading through comments don't want to hear what you thought about the fake blood and plot of the show. Got it?

@DibyaTPB
Thank you for the upload!"
,YardBoy,2012-09-19T08:17Z,"Video is fine, A9/V9.
