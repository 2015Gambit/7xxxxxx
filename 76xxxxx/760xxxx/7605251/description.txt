I'm not reliable for what happens with this DDoS'er.
I made it for test purposes and educational purposes only.






Anyway, download the Torrent, It shouldn't be Rar'd but if it is, it means the link has been updated.

When i first made this it had 250 Shells, i decided to release the last 3 Public.
It should last 5 months or so.




I think the instructions are pretty strait forward.

Put in the username, and world.
Click on "Resolve IP"
It should give you an IP adress.
Copy and paste that into the "IP" spot.
"Attack IP !"


Boom.
