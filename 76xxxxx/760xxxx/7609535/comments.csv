Movies that are 2:35:1 aspect ratio are letterboxed in HD resolution (16:9), so to avoid making the filesize bigger when the screen would be nothing but black, they crop the height to get rid of the letterboxing.
The actual movie image is the same as the original disc, in full resolution. 1080p is just the proper name of the format."
