Systems of Linear Inequalities by A. S. Solodovnikov.

The book tells about the relation of systems of linear
inequalities to convex polyhedra, gives a description of the
set of all solutions of a system of linear inequalities,
analyses the questions of compatibility and
incompatibilityl; finally, it gives an insight into linear
programming as one of the topics in the theory of
systems of linear inequalities. The last section but one
gives a proof of duality theorem of lienar programming.
The book is intended for senior pupils and all amateur
mathematicians.

 The book was translated the Russian by Vladimir Shokurov and was
  first published by Mir in 1979.
