Comments: Remastered from an unverified gen analog tape>DAT>CDr transfer.
This is not Sean's tape nor Presence's direct download.
This flawless concert has one of the most untypical No Quarter ever played and one of
the best ever recording of Bonham's drums both in terms of sound and performance.
Too bad the final section of the show is still missing.
