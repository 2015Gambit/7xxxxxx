If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: 4.0 and up
Overview: Give your phone a flat/matte look with Flat Icons!


Flat icons are the apps' original icons, but I have removed the gradients, shadows, and reflections to give them a flat/matte look. I have also changed the colors to match the Android design Guidelines.
This icon pack includes 237 icons!
To see a full list go to Android.Mitchs.co
This app is for APEX (Android 4.0+) launcher. I also have themes available for Go Launcher and ADW Launcher.
If you have a phone with a non-stock skin (like HTC Sense, Moto Blur, Samsung Touchwiz), some of the stock apps like messaging and contacts will not change automatically. You will have to manually change them. There is no way I know of for fixing it. Sorry.
For more info on Flat Icons, and to see more of the icons, go to http://android.mitchs.co

What's in this version:
Version 1.3
-Few more icons
-Fixed problem where many stock icons don't change (On STOCK android only)
Todo:
-Make stock icons change on non-stock android (sense, blur, touchwiz, etc...)
-Delete duplicate icons (sorry! I forget to do this whenever im working on these apps)
