Don't know what will happen if I let it do. You can find more secure copies of AVG PC Tuneup. At least older ones, working well."

,ag_orange,2012-09-08T22:46Z,I don't get it...it's TuneUp Utilities but now says AVG PC TuneUp...did they made this software for them or they are owners now? Thanks anyway...
,joney11,2012-09-09T07:16Z,"if it is the original copy of avg then why they wrote these comments please tell us, thank you."
,ag_orange,2012-09-09T10:09Z,It is original copy of avg pc tune up 2013 but i'm just suprised because it's actually new/old TuneUp Utilities...before i had both of them installed...
,KaparAugust,2012-09-10T00:06Z,"Well, it is TuneUp Utilities, obviously. I have that and the old AVG PC Tuneup now. And the later is completetly different. I only use it for finetuning my internetconnection. I can't find anything about the change on AVG homesite."
,Froztiez,2012-09-12T23:54Z,"Even though I did not update the software or allow it to connect to the internet, it says the key is not genuine and the same if I use another key."
,r41n1sm,2012-09-13T07:51Z,"shit, worked great on me for one of the two hard drives i had, an hdd and an ssd. I formatted the hdd since i didn't need the os on that one, and now trying to install on the ssd. ""This key is for another AVG product."" FUCK"
,millbah,2012-09-22T02:34Z,Good one Senzati - you are way out in front of the rest. Keys are being detected!
,rulex25,2012-09-24T19:08Z,"It worked fine for a week, now it says I don't have a Genuine Copy of the product."
