_____________________________________________________________Summary__

An hour south of Miami is the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, 
Haiti. In 1991 its citizens elected a former Roman Catholic priest 
and exponent of liberation theology, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, as 
president. Popular among Haiti's poor and disenfranchised, Aristide 
become a target of Haiti's business interests (and the political 
parties that served those interests) because of his daring policies 
which tried to raise the standard of living for the huge majority of 
Haitians. During his second term in office, his government came under 
increasing pressure from many sides and by 2004 political violence 
had escalated sharply. On February 29, 2004, Aristide and his family 
left Haiti on a US-dispatched airplane -- according to Aristide, 
against his will; the US claims with his full cooperation.

Nicolas Rossier's powerful and informative documentary focuses on 
Aristide's later years as president, as he struggled to fulfill his 
promises of reform in the face of mounting domestic opposition 
(driven in large part by business and military interests) and, 
simultaneously, an increasingly hostile relationship with the United 
States.

Featuring an exclusive interview with Aristide from his exile in 
South Africa as well as the views of a wide range of supporters 
and critics including US Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega, 
Colin Powell, and Noam Chomsky, and intermixed with searing glimpes 
inside strife-torn Haiti, Aristide and the Endless Revolution offers 
a moving testimony to the Haitian peoples' struggle against oppression 
and exposes the tangled web of hope, deceit, and political violence that 
brought the world's first black republic to its knees.
