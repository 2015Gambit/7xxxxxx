Anyone recommend a good monthly for me? I am up to date on powers, invincible, walking dead, morning glories, chew, locke and key, irredeemable, incorruptable, fables. I would appreciate any advice on a new one"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-09-07T18:39Z,"opmed1: If you're not reading new Valiant titles you should definitely check them,they're all great IMO.As far as other titles,I'm reading most of the DC titles and at Marvel I'm reading Daredevil and Punisher ( since they aren't associated with this AvX nonsense ),that't it from me as I don't have time for reading more comics.Oh and check out also Saga and Rachel rising."
