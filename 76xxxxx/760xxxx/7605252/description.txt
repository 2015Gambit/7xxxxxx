Γÿà NO HIDDEN COST: Once you and your friends download the application, you can use it to chat as much as you want. Send a million messages a day to your friends for free! WhatsApp uses your Internet connection: 3G/EDGE or Wi-Fi when available.

Γÿà MULTIMEDIA: Send Video, Images, and Voice notes to your friends and contacts.

Γÿà GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group conversations with your contacts.

Γÿà NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: Just like there is no added cost to send an international email, there is no cost to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends all over the world as long as they have WhatsApp Messenger installed and avoid those pesky international SMS costs.
