------------------------------------------------------

I have almost 1500 Underground comic books in a digital format. I will be restoring and uploading many of my favorites over the coming months. Any requests, just say the word.

So what does 'Restored' mean? Well with all due respect to the great and wonderful Sir Real (if you know the name, you know his power!) and all the other scanners who have shared these books with the online world, the pages of these books were not yellow when first printed. Newsprint? Yes, often they were. Cheap paper? Yeah, that too. But not yellow.

In most cases, the changes make the books look better than they did when they were originally printed. By turning the newsprint or cheap paper they were printed on to a bright white, with crisp, clear greys and solid blacks on top, they look very much like a new b&w comic you would buy right off the shelf today.

This is accomplished by running the b&w pages through the PhotoScape Batch Editor. The Filters applied to the pages are; Grayscale (changes the image to greyscale); a 'Middle' of 'High' setting on Auto Level (greatly improves the blacks); a 'Low' or +1 Sharpen (barely noticeable, even if you watch the changes take place); 'Deepen' is used if there is bleed through from the image on the back of the page or to improve the overall look or color or b&w pages. Occasionally 'Brighten' or 'Darken' are used if needed. Color covers, back or interior pages are 'Restored' on a page by page basis.

And even though I'm not really into scanner tags, out of respect for the huge amount of work he's done (or did - who knows how one so mysterious works?!), if an original Sir Real front page existed I have moved it to the back of the book. "

A 21-gun salute to you, sir, for your tireless efforts and attention to detail. I mean, wow! seriously...

Do you have hi-res scans of Cannon, Sally Forth, Wizard King, Witzend, etc? I've got the first two in digital format, but they're just normal size, and you know Wood needs to be appreciated in higher quality detail.

I noticed many Vertigo titles and Hernandez Bros in your uploads. Do you have any Eros comics, NBM, or other more 'adult' comics? 

And there's an online comic that I found and liked, it's called Enchantae (cheerful, lighthearted, cartoony smut in a medieval fantasy world). If you have any of that beyond episode 37, please do upload.

I'm also interested in early arcs of Nexus & American Flagg!, the Elektra Saga  miniseries, any Modesty Blaise collections (especially those drawn by John M. Burns...anything by this guy is cool) and the Warren mag 1984 (later 1994)."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-07T02:21Z,"Hey, thanks ajjibhai! I'm glad to do it so long as people appear to be interested.

Lets see...

Witzend, yes! In fact, it's not too far down the list. As is a good deal of other Wood.

The other stuff in  your first paragraph I'm not sure on. I'll have to take a look 'around'.

Eros, NBM and 'adult stuff', ehh, hit and miss on that. A good deal of what I upload is 'adult', just not 'hard core'. I have a few things I'm planning on uploading, but for the most part I stopped collecting (and keeping) the stuff that was hard core just for the sake of being hard core a long time ago. I've got a few good things in the pipeline, though (uuuh heh, he said 'pipeline').

Don't know anything about Enchantae, but it sounds interesting, so I'll see what I can come up with.

The stuff in the last paragraph, hmmm, maybe some of that. Yeah. Just be patient and keep an eye out because I'm not sure when any of it will go up.
