,tonyclem,2012-09-07T05:56Z,"Ok, dynstab2 what does that mean? Just wondering. Or is your post just to advertise the other torrents available?"
[T],dynstab2,2012-09-08T13:43Z,"Au contraire! I was trying to make your torrent shine among the previous two, telling people how better it is, though not perfect, to justify not a first but a second duplicate and the ensuing swarm splitting that will cause (apparent) obsolescence of the original upload.

Now if you open your PDF file and read its metadata (file properties), you will understand why I am worried of seeing my good name be given a bad rep because of your duplicate...  Same applies to 594mgnav.

Ah never mind then, I no longer upload."
,tonyclem,2012-09-08T23:49Z,Thank you VIP dynstab2. I should have looked first before uploading. I was unaware that PB had textbooks until I uploaded this one. I was not a repack. Sorry to split swarm. I was just happy to help where I can.
