I got this off demonoid and it is amazing. The originals restored and not cropped like if you place the originals released from Lucas on a blu ray player. This is a full screen reproduction. Incredible for the fan. Here's the info on this player's project: http://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Star-Wars-Trilogy-Hyperspace-Collection-720p-AVCHD-Project-Complete-and-Now-Available-See-Post-42-for-final-details/topic/12688/

No text file that I can put in with stats, so reference the link. I wanted to have the hyperspace collection on my smartphone so I included the three avi's I made just in case they come in handy for anyone else.

Enjoy! And remember, a pirate's force flows from seeding :)
