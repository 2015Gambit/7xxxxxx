The Bletchley Circle is a new series for ITV1. Four ordinary women with an extraordinary flair for code-breaking and razor-sharp intelligence skills are the focus of this new murder mystery drama. Anna Maxwell Martin (South Riding, Bleak House) will star as Susan, Rachel Stirling (Women in Love, Boy Meets Girl) is Millie, RADA graduate Sophie Rundle plays Lucy and Julie Graham (Lapland, Doc Martin) is Jean. Three 60-minute episodes have been commissioned from World Production based on the lives of four fictional women whose brilliant work at top security HQ Bletchley Park during World War II helped break codes used by the German military.
Set in 1951, Susan, Millie, Lucy and Jean have returned to their normal lives modestly setting aside the part they played in producing crucial intelligence which helped the Allies to victory and shortened the war. Behind Susan's conventional exterior as a 1950's housewife and mother, there's a steely determination you under-estimate at your peril. Seemingly unadventurous and conservative on the surface, our unlikely heroine is a force to be reckoned with. She just hasn't done anything about it for the last eight years! Until now that is and the unresolved murders of Jane Hart and Patricia Oakes. With her handwritten charts of numbers, dates and times, and stretched lines of wool connecting pins to clips, Susan has spotted a pattern of behavior no one else has. Susan goes to the police only to be met with utter skepticism by the desk sergeant. Unaware of her Bletchley background, the police refuse to take Susan's theory seriously. She quickly realizes she can only begin the murders and bring the culprit to justice with the help of her former friends. Bohemian Millie, speaker of fourteen languages and with a streetwise approach to life, Lucy whose youthful, naive exterior masks a brilliant memory for data recall and Jean, the methodical no-nonsense organizer with valuable access to key records and documents.

The first of three episodes in this new series The Bletchley Circle starts at 9.00pm on ITV1 tonight. The story is about a group of former Bletchley Park codebreakers. When Susan Gray spots a hidden pattern in a series of murders, she tries to inform the police. But when they and her husband insist she forger her theory Susan enlists her wartime friends to try and track down the murderer. The show stars Anna Maxwell Martin, Rachel Stirling, Julie Graham, Sophie Rundle, and Ed Birch.
