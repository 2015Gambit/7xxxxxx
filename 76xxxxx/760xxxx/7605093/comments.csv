,JBiz1,2012-09-07T06:29Z,"Anyone tried this and verified that this works with 2013?? I'm kinda scared to dl this file the 1st comment says ""Nice Game good graphics?!?"" WTF?"
,JBiz1,2012-09-07T06:31Z,Matter of fact just checked it in UTorrent to look at the files and this idiot has the same file 3 times in the source.....hummm im weary of this one someone verify that this is real.
,extasy88,2012-09-09T02:01Z,It's real. I can confirm that it works. There's 3 files for three different types of Kaspersky.
,JBiz1,2012-09-12T02:48Z,I need the key file for 2013 where can I find it????
,JBiz1,2012-09-12T02:51Z,Ok so how exactly do I use this I can not find a key file for 2013 Im on a 3month key but dont know where to find the file at...help please
,devanshdave,2012-09-12T09:08Z,"hey, you can apply any key named KIS9, KIS11 to this 2013 version. old not blacklisted keys of previous versions also work...

It was a mistake that I have posted this torrent in Game section. And this is not a virus, all 3 files are different and for different version...

there are many sites out there which gives you keys, you can directly apply via this drag drop function of my exe files..."
,JBiz1,2012-09-12T21:57Z,Many thanks devanshdave I have DL'ed it and I just could not find my key but now I will goto another site get the key file and drag and drop using this .exe Thanks again bro!!
,Arionex,2012-09-16T03:54Z,HI anyone care to explain a little better how this torrent works exactly? I'm used to keygens and random activators but this drag/drop feature got me confused here. Thanks in advance.
,psozero,2012-09-18T16:40Z,"I was using  KIS 2013 beta for 90 days in Win 8 when the trial period has expired.

Then I opened  'the Licensing window' of the Kaspersky and deleted the key that was in use, clicked  'Activate the application' and then 
ran the 'Kaspersky 2013 Key Changer By Dev@nsh.exe' and dragged another key of  'Kaspersky 2013' into the 'Key Changer' then activated it over a new  test period of 90 days.

It seems it works even with new keys that already expired.

These keys were found by Google.

The test period of any final version of Kaspersky is 30 days.

To me it is working well, at least so far"
,noel_lee,2012-09-25T19:57Z,"care to explain the steps,more precisely????
i dragged a key file to the key changer.
after that how should i proceed?
do i have to enter the particular key file serials to the activation code?
but its not possible to know the serials in the key file..
help.let this torrent not go wasted."
,noel_lee,2012-09-25T20:05Z,"thnks..i got it now..
and got it worked..so far now..
to those who have confusion to use this.
just dont open the kaspersky.no need..
run the key changer and drag and drop any key file.after some time kaspersky will be launched and show you that the key worked.

,gemini22,2012-09-26T07:46Z,Worked perfect with my key for KIS 2012!  Thanks!
,noel_lee,2012-09-26T20:35Z,"i used this key changer with the last key file from chattchitto torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7674201/Kaspersky_Internet_Security_2012_Keys_[ChattChitto_RG]

,JamsBand,2012-09-28T12:00Z,"some of you comment makers sound so retarded. Just download it and use and quit asking ""help me how does it work"". Jeeze just figure it out... its not rocket science. If you need that much help you should not be getting stuff off pirate bay."
