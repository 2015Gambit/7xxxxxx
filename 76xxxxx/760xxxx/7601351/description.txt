Using KMPlayer and VLC, I noticed the audio was a little out of sync with the video.  Using KMPlayer, I was able to correct this for playback by:
- Right-click on playback screen, choose ΓÇÿPlaybackΓÇÖ option
- The next menu opens automatically; choose ΓÇÿAudio Resync>ΓÇÖ
- On the next menu, choose ΓÇÿResyncAudio +0.5sΓÇÖ (once or twice!)
- I find that 4:3 TV format looks the best. Check ΓÇÿScreen ControlsΓÇÖ in KMPlayer menu (again, right-click on screen for main menu) to verify. 

Please let me know how it works in the field.
