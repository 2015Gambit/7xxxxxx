When you talk to Pierre, he does not just repeating his words ... as a parrot, he remembers what you've said before and then randomly repeat later. Thus he combines different parts of your sentences to create new sentences funny. Sometimes he repeats just a part more than once and then adds something completely different at the end. 

Try talking to Pierre, the responses are always unexpected and hilarious.
