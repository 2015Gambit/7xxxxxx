Due to the size and lack of any mentions of a 720 being pred anywhere that seems to be the case.

If im wrong buzzsaw please feel free to correct me...  or please include the source info next time (dvd or bluray)"

,The.Buzzsaw,2012-09-07T04:39Z,"I attained the file, watched it, and then uploaded it. Yes, I think it was a DVD rip that was upgraded to a 720p file. It seemed to be better quality than the dvdrip I watched, so I put it on here. Sorry if it's not up to your standards. I was just trying to give everyone a better quality version."
