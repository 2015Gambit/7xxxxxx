About:

Hailing from the city of burning churches - Adelaide, South Australia - the utter hellstorm that is Darklord was conceived around late 1991, early 1992, minus a drummer, when Destroyer (bass), Nekromancer (lead/rhythm guitar) and Stormbringer (lead/rhythm guitar/vocals), formed a band which would not only expand the boundaries of extreme black/death metal, but would also bring an extra touch of progressive class to the genre.

Darklord are an extreme band boasting a competent, professional twin lead attack, which has been compared to the likes of Malmsteen, Gilbert, Petrucci, etc. Darklord also claim to use the lowest drop tuning known to man due to Stormbringer and Nekromancer both playing custom made twin neck guitars, which means things are sounding very heavy in Australia these days. The sound of these guitars must be heard live to be believed. The music is extremely heavy, fast, dark and violent while still incorporating a progressive touch of orchestral choirs, strings, and synth. You'll find no female vocals or flutes or other tired 'northern folk metal' dross here. Only spikes, nails, chains and leather are allowed. And this isn't just more chug-chug, dry sounding death metal either. This music is relentlessly extreme and has a definite ambience. Fans of the heaviest, most extreme metal need look no further.
