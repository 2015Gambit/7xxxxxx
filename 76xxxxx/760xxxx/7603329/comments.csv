,asrocker,2012-09-07T17:01Z,Works great but it does ask for an update to go on so I recommend running it on a banned 360 if you have one till someone knows what the update is for.

,ezchamp,2012-09-07T22:16Z,"Anyone else getting a ""failed to load device""?

,JonAndRoid,2012-09-08T14:58Z,"Downloaded fast, how do you guys get these games before they even come out, this game isnt supposed to come out unitl the 11th...i think its awesome but id just like to know how lol. btw, this is not verified through abgx, ""There is no verified rip of Xex CRC D15CBB90 in the online database"" But i know thats only because there is no real copy yet but usually it gets verified as a working Xex CRC when the real game comes out. just an fyi"
,ezchamp,2012-09-08T19:44Z,"@popi1978   check your button configuration, my son changed it and i had the same problem for like 10 minutes."

,Ryuman13,2012-09-11T22:58Z,"I've got a serious problem with my 360 now, I tried to run it with my xkey360, and the xbox asked for an update. I clicked update, and then i got an error message that it couldn't read the update from the disc. The status code i got with this error is: 397F - 3CD6 - 2800 - 0f00 - C000 - 0034. This error keeps coming up now every time I turn on my xbox. If anyone has a solution to this, thank you very much in advance!"
,jaymacky,2012-09-12T08:44Z,"MAN!! It's working for me after that fuking update, the last time I did one, it fuked my system up, I was lucky I lived in Korea, but now am back in the U.S. so I have to be 100% careful. I'd hate to send my xbox to my friend and have to pay him extra money just to re mod it.  Does anyone know if Xbox is doing a firmware update later on?????"

 Reset XBOX 360 Failed System Updates

    With the console off, press and hold the sync up button.


    While holding the sync button press the power button to turn on the console


    Continue to hold the sync button until the Console has booted up completely.


    During the boot process the console should clear any failed updates, allowing you to use it normally. "
