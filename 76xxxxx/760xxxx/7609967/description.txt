This is the windows support software for windows 7 needed to dual boot mac with bootcamp 4.0. The support software contains all the necessary drivers to run windows on bootcamp. Just unrar teh rar file and click on Boot camp folder. Then click on setup application run it follow instructions and bam your drivers will be installed.

I acquired this from someone else online ,and I am distributing this to everyone else who has trouble downloading windows support software from bootcamp.
