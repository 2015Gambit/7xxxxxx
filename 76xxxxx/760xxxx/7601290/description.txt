Successful French band formed in 1983 by Olivier Champeau (vocals, keyboards) and Vincent Legallo (vocals, guitar). Their first works had a quite romantic new-wave sound. It has radically evolved during the years with electro-dance atmospheres and/or rock-y sounds. They were joined in 1988 by Nicolas Dufaure (bass). 
They gained a much larger audience when they signed to Lively Art and were part of the Touching Pop (pseudo musical movement they created together with Asylum Party and Mary Goes Round). Joined by Ronan Lesergent (keyboards) and Georges Remiet (guitar) in 1992, they disbanded the same year after a suprisingly common pop/rock album and a final tour. Singer Olivier Champeau is now known as Doctorolive for more techno/house sounds.
