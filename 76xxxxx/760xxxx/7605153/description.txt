Dividing A Segment In A Given Ratio by N. M. Beskin.

The booklet describes various theories to which a deep study of the problem of dividing a line segment in a given ratio  leads. Considering this elementary and those related to it, the  reader will make a short travel over some branches of mathematics come into contact with affine and projective geometry and the theory of groups, though in most cases without mentioning those names.  The book is intended for pupils of the senior forms; in its main parts it can be easily grasped by pupils of the seventh and eighth forms.

  The book was translated from the Russian by V. Zhitomirsky and was
  first published by Mir in 1975.
