Along with the large capacity hard disk popularity,  people were already used to copying compact discs to CD/DVD image files, generally used  is the famous ISO 9660 international standards format, therefore CD/DVD image files are called ISO files. Because the ISO file retained complete data information of the compact disc (including compact disc boot information), you were allowed the convenience to use commonly used CD/DVD burning software (for example Nero-Burning ROM ) to record the disc with your CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW over and over forever, it can also be used directly through Virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive software (for example Daemon-Tools ) .
UltraISO  is an ISO CD/DVD image file creating/editing/converting tool and a bootable CD/DVD maker , it can directly edit the CD/DVD image file and extract files and folders from it, as well as directly make ISO files from your CD/DVD-ROM or  hard disk. At the same time, you can maintain the ISO bootable information, thus creating your own bootable CD/DVDs. You now have the power to make and  edit your own ISO files, and then burn them to CD/DVD for your own needs.
