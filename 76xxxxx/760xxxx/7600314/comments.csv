~ 350MB SUCKS ASS IN THIS TIME AN AGE And should be abandoned, discouraged and laughed at - THOSE SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN VIP STATUS NOR ANY ""uploader"" status. It's not my fault if some people have pay-per-GB because it's not anyones . If you can't upload proper stuff stop being an ""uploader"". Talking about some of other previous torrents after the scene stopped uploading that did most of the 3rd season.

I am watching over a HDTV via HDTV so that bullcrap quality is unwatchable.

Thank you again seneline, please don't drop out in the middle of season. THANK YOU again!"
,stewox,2012-09-05T10:33Z,"Eh, I meant that i watch on HDTV via HDD, a 500GB one so i don't CARE about the size of these files, just 

Also sound is more important 

If you can make change, please encode in a bit better sound because A LOT OF TIMEs in this show people talk interesting things silently and it's an nightmare to recognize what they're saying off-camera or being as quiet to avoid being heard when talking some stuff. Thanks."
,ALIEN68,2012-09-05T20:14Z,Don't understand why all theese RAR files ? Why to pack it ? Old times are already gone.... 
,stewox,2012-09-06T09:57Z,"maybe it was repacked by scene ... no idea.

Packs maybe to get it easier on a DVD for storage is one thing I could think of, but I have tons of HDD storage and use it for watching as well, feels unnecessary for most people."
