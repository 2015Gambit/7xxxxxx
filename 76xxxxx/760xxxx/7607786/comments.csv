TS no matter if its 720p cam its still not HD... nowhere near it."
,Gacy8Gein,2012-09-07T08:47Z,"Its HighRes-Movies, Not HD.
720p is High Resolution.

Get over it.

Good action flick.

If its anything like their Paranormaan release, it should be watchable.
Will comment A/V when its completed."
,vonepic,2012-09-07T19:32Z,"Technically, by definition, 720p, or 720 vertical lines in a progressive mode (60 frames per second non interlaced), is listed as a HD or high definition source.  Whether you agree or not, or feel the content being filmed is not up to par, is another story.. Obviously any handcam or phone cam or whatever filmed in a dark theater is going to be way too dark and blurry."
