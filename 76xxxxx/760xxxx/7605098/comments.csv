,piranical,2012-09-08T18:41Z,"thanks ThumperTM. Re this torrent, presuming i already have windows 7 ultimate 64 from about May 2012, what would be the point in d/ling this one. is there some unique feature that sets it apart from all the other win 7 utimates on here. i just want to know if i would get any advantage from this one over the one i have now??"
,Mengg,2012-09-09T10:47Z,Is retail version?and how install?delete all partition or format partion?
,Johno123,2012-09-09T21:09Z,"Forgive me if I sound n00b, but, you specify using the activator. The torrent doesn't come packaged with and activator, rather a rar file named 'Windows Installer'. This flagged up as a Trojan when transferring to a USB stick.

I installed windows, skipped activation, and it's running. System info shows a product key and states that it is activated, without using the packaged stuff. 

So, can you confirm whether this copy of windows Is pre-activated?"

,loumos123,2012-09-10T08:37Z,32 bit?
,thedicktate,2012-09-11T03:52Z,Thanks! This worked perfectly. Just a quick question: is it safe to download the KB971033 update?  I know this was an issue with older activators.
,thedicktate,2012-09-11T13:53Z,"Also, everything seems to be working, but it till has a water mark on the desktop ""test mode | build 7601""

Anyone else have that?"
,Sick3r,2012-09-11T21:20Z,Everything works like clockwork. =) Validations as well. Thanks a bunch!
,mmsdos,2012-09-12T11:33Z,"Hi thanks for up!

So my problem is ""and i surely think its on my end, but i sitll need help with it""

So i download and ""burned"" to USB stick with windows usb tool, after the first time didn't work giving me a message


""Load Driver. A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing. If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, please insert it now. Note: If the Windows installation media is in de CD/DVD drive, you can safely remove it for this step.""

So i googled it tried everything i found here nothing has worked so far. So i turn here and hope someone can help me.

Does anyone know what kind of issue this is and how to solve it?

Im running windows 7 atm its premium and fully updated. I just want a new fresh install but it dosn't seem to work.

,Sick3r,2012-09-12T22:37Z,"mmsdos:

Hey.. I installed from burned  DVD and the same thing happened for me. When that message comes up, just wait until you get back to the install menu screen again and try again. Worked for me. Might me just a glitch or something. "
,Und3rtoW,2012-09-14T05:45Z,Did this ISO includes more languages â&#x20AC;&#x2039;â&#x20AC;&#x2039;(multi5) or only in English?
,dilzo,2012-09-15T11:50Z,is this ISO getting boot... ??
,UrPhobia,2012-09-16T09:28Z,"Nice upload, many thanks!

Quick question though, I'm with Johno on this one.. What is the point of the activator when I didn't need it? Or it doesn't appear that I need it. I haven't installed it, and windows is activated and has a product ID showing.

I'll keep it like it is, until I hear otherwise, or something changes. Thanks again!"

,le.spectre,2012-09-18T23:25Z,"i had BSoD after trying to install AHCI mode from USB drve.

i had to use a different usb port and when the prompt came up to specify the missing driver (AHCI), i had to remove the usb drive and put it in ANOTHER usb port.

then browse through the list in ""X:$WinPEDriver$x64..."" to find your AHCI driver.

i don't understand why this happens, but it works this way."
