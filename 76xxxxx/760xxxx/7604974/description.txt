Issues 1-28 of 'Weirdo'

Last Gasp, 1981-1993

Weirdo was a magazine-sized comics anthology created by Robert Crumb and published by Last Gasp from 1981 to 1993.

Weirdo served as a 'low art' counterpoint to its contemporary highbrow Raw. Early issues of Weirdo reflect Crumb's interests at the time - outsider art, fumetti, Church of the SubGenius-type anti-propaganda and assorted 'weirdness'. It also introduced artists such as Peter Bagge, Dori Seda and Dennis (Stickboy) Worden.

With issue 10, Crumb handed over the editing reins to Bagge. With issue 18, the reins went to Crumb's wife, cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb (except for issue 25, which was again edited by Bagge). The three editorial tenures were known respectively as 'Personal Confessions', the 'Coming of the Bad Boys', and the 'Twisted Sisters'.

Weirdo's final issue, 28, an internationally themed 68-page giant titled Verre D'eau (in French, 'glass of water'), was published in 1993.
