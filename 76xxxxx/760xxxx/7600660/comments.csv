Re-upload this zipped and you got a #1 hit. MacKeeper is the shittiest thing ever made for Mac and considered malicious by many experts."
,wampus64,2012-09-06T17:20Z,Mackeeper IS malware. I know from experience and a lighter money in bank total. Extremely hard to remove from Mac shell and uses too much of system resources. Reminds me of Norton and Symantec a/v and shields on a PC.
