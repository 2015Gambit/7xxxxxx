[V],mdprosser,2012-09-09T04:36Z,"For those of you who enjoyed this episode, PLEASE watch the BBC series ""Sherlock"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch!  I thought ""Elementary"" was excellent, & I will definitely be watching it this fall, but ""Sherlock"" is BY FAR ten times better... There are only 3 episodes per season (as it is a BBC show), and each episode is briliiantly written, acted, and directed... trust me you won't want to stop watching!  Here are TPB links to the torrents for each series:

Series 1:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6435221/Sherlock_Holmes__(BBC_2010_-_Complete_Series)

Series 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6973985/Sherlock_Holmes__(BBC_2012_-_Complete_Series)

I hope you take my advice and enjoy!  :) "
