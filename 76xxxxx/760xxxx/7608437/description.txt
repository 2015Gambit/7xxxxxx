A lot has been written about Weezer's "lost" rock opera that was initially intended to be their 2nd album, but eventually was discarded and distilled into 'Pinkerton' in 1996. If you're curious, read here:
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_from_the_Black_Hole

This is a "Songs From The Black Hole" recreation, recorded from scratch, which incorporates material from all the released Rivers Cuomo demos, the full band Weezer demos for the project, the Pinkerton recordings, and information from the many pages of notes, lyrics and sheet music in "The Pinkerton Diaries" which was released last year (as well as a small amount of our own creative input). A bunch of people worked on this over a long period of time.


Perhaps I'll put up some more information about this later on.
