,vintage_vinyl,2012-09-05T16:58Z,"just wanted to say thank u for this cybergodsig...lol...not sure what all the rukkus is about on here, but i think the preservation of vinyl is awesome and im all for it...just a small bit of advice...if i might....if someone posted such as aksman, pbthal, npto, or any others that post on here for a long time...you could perhaps add that in as i noticed on the metallica...metallica upload so the get the credit for the original upload....i believe you will get more respect and maybe even a few compliments...we all love the sound of a great vinyl rip and i love the equipment log writeups as well on uploads so i can also see if its worthy of a download...i use good to vg equipment myself and enjoy reading about the setups as well...thank u for the upload...just wanted to shoot you that advice...hopefully you will take it as that and not criticism....have a nice day, and thanks....vintage_vinyl"
