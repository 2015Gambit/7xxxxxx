This second disc covers the years 1964-1967, when Bacharach cemented relationships with the two most important collaborators during these years, lyricist Hal David and singer Dionne Warwick.  This trio was responsible for a flood of singles and albums that seemed to make them only slightly less famous than The Beatles at times.  The songwriting team was also providing material for singers such as Tom Jones, Tony Orlando, Bobby Goldsboro, Jackie DeShannon, and Trini Lopez.
