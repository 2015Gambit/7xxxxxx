Cartoon quartet Gorillaz (the brainchild of Blur frontman Damon Albarn and 'Tank Girl' creator Jamie Hewlett, comprises of the characters Noodle, Murdoc, 2-D, and Russell who inhabit a virtual world on Gorillaz.com) return with their sophomore album 'Demon Days', the follow-up to Gorillaz's worldwide smash self-titled debut.
Accurately described as "darker" and "more intense" than its predecessor, but no less eclectic, the album was co-produced by Albarn and Danger Mouse. 'Last Living Souls' is marked by acoustic strumming and piano melodies, while 'Kids With Guns' threads a sample of Salt-N-Pepa's 'Push It' through a multi-faceted musical backdrop. The collective puts a weird spin on seductive soul with 'Every Planet We Reach Is Dead', while 'White Light' starts off in similar territory as Blur's raucous 'Song 2' before being interrupted by an angelic interlude. For an extra dash of oddness, actor Dennis Hopper offers spoken-word intonations atop 'Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head'.
The London Community Gospel Choir can be heard on the title track while De La Soul make an appearance on the albums first single 'Feel Good Inc'. There are also guest spots by Blondie's Deborah Harry, rock legend Ike Turner, the Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder and underground rapper MF Doom sprinkled throughout other cuts. The Gorillaz are back in town!
