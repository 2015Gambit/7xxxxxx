This is my first torrent, and from my personal collections. Its from Discovery channel and about top ten fighters, bombers, tanks and fighting ships. Pls forgive me for not adding screen shots. If you want screen shots, pls tell me where to upload pictures for free and so i will do it... If you like this, i wont ask thanks like typical uploaders, better seed it for others so this torrent stays useful and active for some time... Thanks in advance for seeders.. But feel free to ask doubts, and also ask any history related doubts and ofcourse documentaries.. I have move than 500 gbs of Documentaries to share. So just ask it and i will share it..
