,clikaroo,2012-09-06T14:28Z,"Congrats on your first up amigo. If you have craploads of documentaries just start upping them yea? ""If you build it they will come"" kinda thing. I know that torrents like this one (and documentaries of all types) are hard to come by. Anything obscure usually gets forgotten, so your contribution will be appreciated bro. "
