,r0ssxx,2012-09-06T02:03Z,This is Way Way to small to be web-dl. People looking for legit web-dl dont want this crap. I'm curious why put web-dl in the subject line? Are you trying to mislead downloaders? Once you re-encode it is no longer a web-dl. Maybe you legitimately don't know what a web-dl is but I doubt it. You should put what you are actually posting in the subject line RE-ENCODED WEB-DL SOURCE.

,mf-den,2012-09-06T18:04Z,"@r0ssxx: Well, if u are looking for a legit Web-Dl and inspite of looking at the size of this torrent, I wonder why u came to this page and also commented for it. The aim of our website is to provide ""legit downloads for ppl with low bandwidth"". I have seen the multitude number of downloads u have done and was really in awe by it. FYI, we watch our encodes on a 40"" LED TV before posting, so before u start going with ur mouth off, pls DOWNLOAD AND CHECK THE QUALITY FOR URSELF, THEN START COMMENTING ABT IT. We do not possess the time and energy to provide crap quality. Then again, I doubt that u understand watever i am telling u."
