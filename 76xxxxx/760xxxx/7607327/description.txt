Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, September 6 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the TSA threatening to arrestreporters. 

Alex also confronts the latest news, including DARPA robots that run faster than the fastest humans, FOIA details on TSA genital groping, and the establishment media's peddling of fiction and lies as reality. 

Alex talks with Lenore Skenazy, editor of the Free Range Kids website, who was contacted by a mother in Virginia who related her story of how she was interrogated by police four times and visited by social services twice after her children were spotted playing outside unsupervised. 

Additional guests include father and daughter and Steve and Andrea Hernandez of Spychips.com who talk with Alex in-studio about San Antonio area High School honor student who has refused to wear a school mandated RFID tracking beacon around her neck because doing so conflicts with her religious beliefs. 

Alex also talks with Tyrel Ventura, the son of former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
