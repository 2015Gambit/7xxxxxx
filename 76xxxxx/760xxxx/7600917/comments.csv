Or, like some people try to do, don't compress, just STORE the ""release"" in a WinRAR archive. Emding up with an impressive release of 9GB where about 5GB actually is zeroes...

The current altium release has changed to a cloud based licensing system. Have no fear, we'll cope with it. But it takes some time to get things straight.
