Altium Designer v10.x.x Toolkit (same for all V10)

Altium Designer - Complex system of designing high-speed electronic devices based on printed circuit boards, which allows developers to create projects, from concept and VHDL-description of the FPGA, to carry out simulation derived schemes and VHDL-code, prepare files for production, and the concept of Live Design, the so-called living design, allows it to complete the project on-board debugging NanoBoard.


System requirements:

* Altium Designer V10.x.x software installed


I decided to split up this release, because the Toolkit
never changes between 10.x.x releases.

It contains:

-Documentation
-Examples
-Component library
