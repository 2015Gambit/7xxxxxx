Horikita to make stage debut as Jeanne dΓÇÖArc


Actress Horikita Maki (21) will make her stage debut as Jeanne d'Arc in a stage adaption of the same name this November.

The play will tell the story of the 19 year-old girl who led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War in the 15th century. Unlike previous works it won't describe her as a fanatic woman, instead it will focus more on the human side of Jeanne d'Arc and how her faith is giving her strength. "The innocent and strong Horikita-san is the perfect woman to play the strong-willed savior of France," the production team underlined their casting choice.

Horikita is quite motivated for the new challenge. "Jeanne d'Arc's actions are very interesting. I'm going to study her a lot and would like to play the role and convey the story to the best of my efforts," she said. "Of course I'm nervous, but I will be happy as long as at least one person comes to watch me tackling this new challenge."

Actor Ito Hideaki (34) will co-star as Charles VII of France. The play will be performed at the Tokyo Akasaka ACT Theater and last from November 30 till December 19, 2010.
