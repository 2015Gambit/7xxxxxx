For the link.
Knew that, without Kevin, the show would decline some. Never knew the whole channel had gone to shit already."

Eclilpse started capping as a hobby. Now is too busy to do it.
SOLARiS will soon will start capping in better quality, but still has to get things set up.
these OzQuant releases are the ONLY ones right now. Quality is an issue, but should be fixed once SOLARiS starts.

@xenoFLASH

yea, AOTS has always been the most popular thing on G4. G4 was already having trouble holding their own, and yes, with the loss of Kevin, they've pretty much lost a huge portion of their viewers and will have to change completely or just have to shut down."

Btw thanx for the upload:)"
