Btw what happened to the brrips of s04 of Breaking Bad? I remember you said it would gonna take a few weeks, and I really would like to know if you're still on that project befor downloading the full Bluray thing."

Hey!  Here is the deal:  I am still planning on doing BB S04, but it won't be Blu-Ray, but WEB-DL.  WEB-DL is from TV but it is without the watermarks and the channel's advertising and stuff.  I am 3 episodes in encoding wise, so I have 10 left.  I can upload that next, but as you can see from the description in this torrent, I do not have much Internet access, so all uploads will be super slow.  I can try to do that one next though.  "

You are welcome!

Have you already watched all 3 seasons?  If so, that is damn fast.  Be patient, as I have some other series like Carnivale, Downton Abbey, and Homeland that I am working on now.  However, The Tudors will be right behind that.  Again though, I don't have much Internet access, so it takes awhile to download shows and then upload them after I have encoded them."
,c.maximus,2012-09-27T03:57Z,Thanks!  My wife can't get enough of the Tudors.  We've watched the first three seasons too.  Your torrents are the best by way of quality/size ratio.  Can't wait for S04!  LONG LIVE MIKY!

You are welcome!  Thanks so much for saying that; it means a lot!  I am downloading the Tudors S04 high quality blu-ray as we speak (35gb) so it will take a bit.  Then it will take a bit to encode the video and audio at much lower and normal bitrates.  Hopefully, I can have that done in a week or so, but it may take a bit longer."
