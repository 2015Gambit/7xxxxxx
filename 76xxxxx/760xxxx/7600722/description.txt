NOTE: I only have Internet access here and there (less than 6 hours a day), so this will be a slow upload most likely, with there being no seeders for hours at a time.  I apologize in and advance, and please be patient. Save the, "please seed" and "there are no seeders" comments for yourself.

Average file size is ~600mb.

All are .mp4's, with 2-channel audio (left & right).

English subtitles are in separate .srt's.  If you are using VLC Media Player, which you should be, you can tap the V key to disable subtitles or delete the .srt files.  If you delete the .srt files, you will have no subtitles at all.  

NOTE: I have not watched this season, but from flipping through, I believe there are hardcoded subtitles for non-English parts (like praying, etc.)
