Areas and Logarithms by A. I. Markushevich in the  Little Mathematics Library.

    This book offers a geometric theory of logarithms, in
    which (natural) logarithms are represented as areas of
    various geometrical shapes. All the properties of
    logarithms, as well as their methods of calculation, are
    then determined from the properties of the areas. The
    book introduces most simple concepts and properties of
    integral calculus, without resort to concept of derivative.
    The book is intended for all lovers of mathematics,
    particularly school children.

The book was translated from the Russian by I. Aleksanova and was first published by Mir in 1981 with a second reprint in 1987.
