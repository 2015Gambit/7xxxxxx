Use your Android device as a torch with this beautiful app!
There are many flashlight apps out there, so why get this one ?

    It is simple and well designed
    launch it and get light instantly by pressing one button
    uses the integrated FlashLight
    also uses your full screen as a light source (works on all devices)
    add a widget for quick access

Try it. It's simply the best at what it does.
