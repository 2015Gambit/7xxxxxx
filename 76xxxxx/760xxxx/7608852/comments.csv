[V],twentyforty,2012-09-07T18:57Z,"On classic (CRT) displays up to 21"" there is no significant visual difference, using recommended playback system and in real-life conditions (actual watching, not ""analyzing"") from normal watching distance recommended by all display (TV and computer) manufacturers.
However, on big displays, higher bit-rate, bigger frame-sizes are better choice.
1080p BluRay rip or disk is the best choice, without any doubt.
Well - it goes like this: this pack is 4.32 GB. smaller season pack of my weekly 480p encodes is 2.14 GB and BluRay is 50 GB and question is always ""is 25 times smaller encode 25 times worse than original"" and derived "" is twice as big 4.32 GB two times better than 2.14 GB""? comes to simple NO. Smaller sizes ALWAYS come with trade-offs, but never as big as their actual size difference. However, better answer is ""It depends"" as mentioned above...

Then, actual difference is more likely in ""have subtitles or not"" or some related thing."

I watch all these encodes on a 42"" LCD at normal viewing distance.  I see little difference in quality that justifies the size difference.

If you already have the smaller size encodes and plan to keep them on a hard disk, then KEEP them.  If you plan to burn onto a DVD, then go with the OnDTV version.  It will fit perfectly."
