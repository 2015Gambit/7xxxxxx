Skeleton Key is the title of a comic book by British author Andi Watson. It was published beginning in 1995 by Slave Labor Graphics and was Watson's first monthly comic. Skeleton Key ran for 30 issues and a number of supplemental stories and was generally well received.

Skeleton Key featured detailed black and white art. Its plot centered around two young women. The first protagonist is Tamsin, a high-school student living in Canada, who discovers the magical skeleton key that lends the series its title. This key can fit any door, and it "unlocks" pathways to other dimensions. While exploring these alternate worlds, she encounters the second protagonist, Kitsune, a Japanese fox spirit. The earlier volumes in the series deal primarily with the adventures of the pair in these alternate worlds, while in the later volumes, the fantasy elements become less prominent and the drama and romance of coming-of-age stories takes center stage.
