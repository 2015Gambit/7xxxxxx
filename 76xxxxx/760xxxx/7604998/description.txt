Rls Notes
─nglagård is perhaps the seminal band hailing
from the progressive rock revival in the
1990s. Combining influences from romantic and
modern classical, 1970s symphonic rock, and
Scandinavian folk music with prodigious
compositional skill and emotional depth,
─nglagård produced Hybris and Epilog, two
epic albums considered essential to any
progressive music collection. They are
currently writing and recording an eagerly
awaited third opus.
