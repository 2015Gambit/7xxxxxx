------------------------------------------------------

I have almost 1500 Underground comic books in a digital format. I will be restoring and uploading many of my favorites over the coming months. Any requests, just say the word.

So what does 'Restored' mean? Well with all due respect to the great and wonderful Sir Real (if you know the name, you know his power!) and all the other scanners who have shared these books with the online world, the pages of these books were not yellow when first printed. Newsprint? Yes, often they were. Cheap paper? Yeah, that too. But not yellow. 

In most cases, the changes make the books look better than they did when they were originally printed. By turning the newsprint or cheap paper they were printed on to a bright white, with crisp, clear greys and solid blacks on top, they look very much like a new b&w comic you would buy right off the shelf today.

This is accomplished by running the b&w pages through the PhotoScape Batch Editor. The Filters applied to the pages are; Grayscale (changes the image to greyscale); a 'Middle' of 'High' setting on Auto Level (greatly improves the blacks); a 'Low' or +1 Sharpen (barely noticeable, even if you watch the changes take place); 'Deepen' is used if there is bleed through from the image on the back of the page or to improve the overall look or color or b&w pages. Occasionally 'Brighten' or 'Darken' are used if needed. Color covers, back or interior pages are 'Restored' on a page by page basis. 

And even though I'm not really into scanner tags, out of respect for the huge amount of work he's done (or did - who knows how one so mysterious works?!), if an original Sir Real front page existed I have moved it to the back of the book.	"

You've been doing a fantastic job with your uploads.  Really above and beyond the call of duty.  I really appreciate it."
,rackemup420,2012-09-06T16:21Z,I agree. At first I was like who is this Spock imposter... now I know... he is god!!! Thank You for all your hard work!!!

And did Sybok no show us the danger of pursuing such ephemeral thoughts?

Heh. Bad Star Trek jokes FTW!

You guys are most welcome. The audience for a lot of the stuff I posted has always been small. As each generation creates their own new underground, or alternative, the interest in the older stuff grows still smaller. Compared to the amount of seeds the new stuff gets my uploads are barely a blip on TPB radar. But so long as I keep seeing that tiny blip of interest, I'll keep uploading."
