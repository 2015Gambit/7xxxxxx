Raj (Raj Kapoor) and Vasanti (Vyjayanthimala) are college mates who clash when she complains to the college principal about a love letter he sent her. Later on realizing her mistake, Vasanti apologizes to him and the two fall in love. Vasanti's elder sister, Geeta (Usha Kiron), supports the family by stitching clothes. Raj rents the room upstairs in their house. He falls ill and in nursing him, Geeta falls in love with him. She confides her love to Vasanti, who decides to sacrifice her love for her the sake of her sister and convinces Raj to marry Geeta. Raj initially neglects Geeta. On finding out, Vasanti writes to him that their sacrifice, made for Geeta's happiness, would mean nothing unless he is a good husband to Geeta. Raj relents and Geeta and he have a son. Vasanti joins them and Geeta suspects that there is something on between Raj and Vasanti and makes Vasanti leave the house. A few years later Geeta, having found out that Raj and Vasanti loved each other, dies in guilt leaving Raj alone to bring up their child making him promise that he will make Vasanti the child's mother. Raj learns of Vasanti's impanding marriage to her former boss (Gemini Ganesh). By the time he reaches there, Vasanti is already married.
