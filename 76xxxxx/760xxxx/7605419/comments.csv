,xboxmodman7369,2012-09-06T21:36Z,"Hey Extremezone thanks again dude for all your uploads! Can you please upload the movie ""Obama 2016"" for us? I saw it at the theater and would love to spread it around for everyone to see!"

,Jthemighty,2012-09-07T06:04Z,"STFU Mellow, contribute if you want to criticize!!!"
,MellowYo,2012-09-07T07:12Z,"I'll criticize whatever I want, am I not allowed freedom of speech? Maybe your from a third world country but around here we say whatever the fuck we please."
,my3angels,2012-09-07T07:25Z,hey extreme could you please get magic mike and five year engagement my bestfriend and I really want to see those
,tgrphnx,2012-09-07T19:25Z,"MellowYo: Actually this is a website on the internet, not a country.  You have no ""right"" of free speech here, nor is this website even hosted on American soil (not that it would matter).  I'm tired of folks whipping out USAs 1st Amendment and thinking it gives them right to be dicks whenever/wherever they want.

As for the movie:
A= 8
V= 8
M= 6 (enjoyable but not a GOOD movie)

Slightly campy, but doesn't take itself too serious. All things considered was fun to watch but I wouldn't watch it again."
,MellowYo,2012-09-08T00:56Z,Yea my laws apply to me dumbshit which is why this site hasnt been shut down yet. If it was hosted in the US it wouldnt have lasted more than a year
,stefniamoo,2012-09-08T01:25Z,"""When an island off the coast of Ireland is invaded by bloodsucking aliens, the heroes discover that getting drunk is the only way to survive.""

now thats a great excuse for a long term party time :D"
,Dreadmore,2012-09-08T05:22Z,"First of all thanks for the upload extreme perfect as always, Not a bad comedy horror if you like that kind of thing.

BTW I agree with tgrphnx people like Mellow make me ashamed to be an American.. No one cares what you think or what rights you have, we just want you to shut the hell up and die."
,SubbyZA,2012-09-09T00:16Z,"Extreme, you Legend you! "
,rudoo7,2012-09-09T21:12Z,"Hey Extreme, any chance of that swedish movie headhunters with english subs? Tried to watch it dubbed and just dosen't work, looks like a good movie though.... "
