Any ideas anyone?!?"

,JetsetJoey,2012-09-08T16:41Z,"UPDATE:
I've always successfully installed DVDFab & the modified dll but after upgrading to the latest version 8.2.1 it says ""Trial User & Expired."" I've even tried installing various other versions with the same failed result. When starting program it shows a date that's already expired!!!

Any ideans anyone?!?"
,sfx34110,2012-09-14T05:03Z,"All those cracks using ""msvcr90.dll"" does not work. It may work on certain computers, but it involves some hardware signature and it will not work on other computers.

The last working crack version was v8.1.7.8 from ChattChitto, where the crack was dvdfab.exe instead of msvcr90.dll"
