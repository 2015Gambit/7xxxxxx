HOW TO GET THE CANDY ONCE YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE FILE
 
first check the file MD5:
e7d0984f7bb632ee19d8dda1337e9fba
 
(lol yes, a "1337" there for the lulz, God is in the detail)
 
then decrypt the file using openssl:
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in file.txt -out decryptedfile.tar.gz
 
password is:
antis3cs5clockTea#579d8c28d34af73fea4354f5386a06a6
 
then uncompress:
tar -xvzf decryptedfile.tar.gz
 
and then check file integrity using the MD5 included in the password u used to
decrypt before:
579d8c28d34af73fea4354f5386a06a6
^ yeah that one.
 
if everything looks fine
then perhaps it is.
 
enjoy it!

With Love!
