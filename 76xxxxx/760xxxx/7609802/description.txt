Call AI contains a piece of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unlike other contact widgets, it learns your most important LOCATIONS and displays the contacts you usually prefer to call in those places (for example, business contacts at the office and friends/family at home).

No configuring, no settings, no GPS needed. The application automatically adapts to your individual ways of use, to provide the ultimate user experience.

How does it work?
After installation, simply add the Call AI widget to the home screen and you're done. Algorithms begin their work immediately, and within the next few days it will learn.

Just keep an eye on the widget, as contacts and background graphic become automatically adapted to your individual use pattern and current location.

What's in this version: (Updated : Sep 4, 2012)
