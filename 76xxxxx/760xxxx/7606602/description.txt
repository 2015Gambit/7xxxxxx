Notes: the video sources colours were totally messed plus i think it was recored
with some sort of efect not totaly sure but we balanced the colours out as much
as we could, gave it some nice booming denoisers and smart smoothers witch took
28hours nd 10mins lol defo nice nd smooth without breaking the sharpness, plus
the line is pretty decent nd video way less croped not as sharp as the kingdom
source but every cam has its issues there is couple places where the colours go
abit dodgy no biggie plus the intro is missing about 40secs or summit lol
Enjoy Ladies Nd Germz Best Till Date iMHO
