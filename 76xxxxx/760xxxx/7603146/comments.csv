,SR4T9US,2012-09-05T23:36Z,"Welcome back Frog !! I don't want to seem ungrateful or anything but while you were on vacation, we kinda got spoiled by Bestec posting screenshots with his uploads. Well, thanks for coming back. you were missed..."
,etaion999,2012-09-06T00:43Z,I agree with SR4T9US.... screenshots are a great addition.
[V],bestec1234,2012-09-06T02:43Z,":) GTF -- are you wanting me to tell you which models you have all of?

Andrea 076
Jeff 002"
[V],bestec1234,2012-09-06T02:57Z,"RE: Screenshots (previews)

I vote for ""let him post the way he wants to"" ...

Uploading can be a lot of work, and it really sucks when someone wants to tell you how to do it."
,SR4T9US,2012-09-06T07:47Z,"Gee, Thanks Bestec for making me look like an ass. I didn't think I was ""telling him"" what to do, just an idea about how we all like screens for the uploads.  I know that uploading can be a pain sometimes, but remember, you guys want to do this. Besides, screens help us decide if we want to get the files or not and it sure helps weed out the nasty ugly bitches that even YOU  sometimes post with only a face shot."
[V],bestec1234,2012-09-06T15:36Z,"Sorry man.  I didn't mean to make you feel bad.  I know you were just making a suggestion.  My comments were more on certain other incidents; there are some people in the past that have been particularly critical of uploaders, and it can be quite frustrating at times.  Asking for previews certainly isn't critical.
"
[V],thegreenfrog,2012-09-06T18:36Z,"No bad feelings. I kind of agree that leechers should take what they are given without too much grumbling but SR4T9US has a point so I will provide a link to a free gallery for the next uploads because it is quick and effective. Now all we need is for TPB to fix that SQL error so  we can upload large torrents without in one shot.

No, I was asking you if the series were complete although it looked like it. It was meant to ask you to upload what I don't have or have little of and you did understand.

THX!"
