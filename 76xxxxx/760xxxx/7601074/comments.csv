,iamchrislechat,2012-09-05T08:52Z,even though i know this show will turn to shit like all the rest of J.J abrams shows do i still have to ask. any good?
,ItzClobert,2012-09-05T09:21Z,^I hear it's pretty bad. Bad Special FX and probably will suffer the same fate as Terra Nova.
,bakeneko,2012-09-05T10:38Z,This is going to hurt.
,beechyboy,2012-09-05T14:15Z,"They cancelled Terra Nova and that was a good show. 
This show isn't even close to been as good..."
,Spazzbunny,2012-09-05T14:29Z,"Terra Nova had alot of viewer, and was one of my favorite Tv show's  Hopefully Netfilx will reconsider  about buying it, I want Season 2!!

As mentioned the story - no electricity by some magic reason - sucks.
If you know a bit about how humans organize, the story doesnÂ´t make sense either.
You would get warlike conditions (or will if you look at the 16 trillion debt in the US)  and the weapons an amunition in the US will last longer than 15 years - no reason for bow and arrows.
Villages would be heavely defended, with walls and maybe machine guns and there would be an outlook. People are not all looking ""casted"" as they do in stupid US shows, no handicapped or fat or ugly or old people.
Attackers would need cars or horses to strike quick and not to be attacked themselves while they move.  
Terra Nova was crap too.

,shayweis,2012-09-06T16:27Z,"thanks for the upload! this show looks so bad that it makes tera nova and falling skies look like a good shows, and its hard cause they are the worst shows even created (well them and whitney). the worst of all is the horrible casting. the acting is elemetary school level. stand above them all is Anna Lise Phillips which makes bad actresses looks bad. avoid at all cost!"
,BadLuckBrian,2012-09-06T22:46Z,can't believe you're judging a tv show by its pilot
,arildus,2012-09-06T23:31Z,Thanx:)
,nda2012,2012-09-07T01:10Z,Jericho got cancelled and this show is not even close to been as good
,maniaq77,2012-09-07T04:27Z,so... it's a sequel to Escape From L.A. then?
,Frixsez,2012-09-07T09:47Z,"All you haters, please just STFU! We don't need your endless whining bullshit! Don't like the show? Don't watch it! It seems though as every show that demands even an inkling of cerebral activity is deemed boring, stupid, retarded etc. Write something adequate about the show or just keep your opinions to yourself and your therapist."
,charlene17,2012-09-07T12:17Z,"@Frixsez
if people having something to say about one thing didn't do it, or if you (obviously) prefer, people keep on letting bad things happen without making any noise then for sure you are a excellent candidate to this mad world of vacant useless citizens !"
,fireyarou,2012-09-07T18:09Z,wikipedia said this episode will not be released until 17/09/2012 ???
,Drakola,2012-09-07T19:33Z,OMG!!!!! What a stupid story!!!no electricity !!REALY!!! I hope the actors are better then the story!
,Frankse,2012-09-08T05:30Z,"A good pilot, will be a good show."
,shagfro,2012-09-08T09:47Z,If your uncertain if you want to use bandwidth to download this pilot based on the negative reviews. Its on hulu plus or you can go to imdb.com and watch the pilot with out the hulu plus subscription. 
,Future_TV,2012-09-08T15:45Z,"Thanks for the UL, ettv! I thought it was an impressive start. The show has potential. You just have suspend your disbelief a bit. Their clothes and haircut are awfully nice and clean for not having any power for over a decade. Feels like they're are trying to cash in on Hunger Games slightly. But still, good start."
,realpeoplepirate,2012-09-08T19:40Z,"Perfect rip as usual ettv, u guys rawk as always:D
Okkkk rumour control time lol :P This episode doesn't suck....tho the series might, only time will tell. I liked Terra Nova for half of season...then it clearly wasn't gonna improve, hopefully this series doesn't suffer that particular pitfall.
To all the people saying its sooooo unbelievable a concept, I would love to read you review startrek or some other successful sci-fi :P
Also this idea of western civilization as we know it falling due to loss of power has been explored countless times in past by people of sufficiently greater intellects than anyone posting on TPB, amd the accepted conclusion seems to be that within 72hours we would descend into utter anarchy that would take years if not decades to rectify. Anyone with a real intellect who is interested in researching this very possibleand quite chilling scenario could do worse than to check out James Burkes' landmark series Connections, and in particular ep1 ""Trigger Effct"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078588/
It concisely shows why most of you mouthbreathers whining on here would be caught in a technological trap and most probably died waiting for MacDonalds to open again ;P"

,highlander888,2012-09-10T08:51Z,Electricity is overrated.
,iamchrislechat,2012-09-10T12:48Z,he says on what i assume is an electricity powered computer
,mmsdos,2012-09-10T22:25Z,"ettv love ur works! Always early and good release.

Ok few answers ""Star Treck"" is not like this show in anyway to the guy referred it as the same. This show wont be good because its in same genres as it makes no sense. 
Star Treck make kind of sense based on tech we dont have and probably wont get, but its nothing ""magical"" about it, some of the races are abit wierd but that's still not magical.
As this shows just randomly say electricity is gone and can never come back just so it gets simple is idiotic. We are in a age we want answer's and question's that are kind of logical or even half sense at least in the genres of sci-fi. If we wanted fantasy then do something with fantasy. Like an Evil warlock took away the electrity sure but this is just stupid.

""Warning spoilers allert""
So what happens is that something just magically takes away electricity forever ""whaat"" and all car's lamp and etc. Yet he has to save some information from his ""computer"" to an USB device. But that's not the kicker the city looks like it's been out of power for like 200 years more close than 15, military running around with weapons from 16s century.

Terra Nova was decent this was shit.
This will go down in just a few episode so no need to get attatched even if u like ""SCI-FI"" Because this has shit plot shit actors."
,Hulk62468,2012-09-10T23:24Z,"The pilot was actually really good. It kinda has a Lost feel to it, but not as lame. I hope the future episodes are as good as the pilot. "

,MaGicbush,2012-09-12T20:07Z,"@shagfro : Really? You do realize your still using bandwidth to get the show from those sources as well right? You don't only use bandwidth on thepiratebay lmao.

As for the negativity it seems good to me, and I watch TV for entertainment now to sit and think about how realistic it is. If I want realism I will walk outside my door."
,khillik,2012-09-14T05:04Z,"this show is great so far. part of the show is not knowing what has happened to the electricity if you watch the pilot it becomes very clear that at least some of them are trying to figure out what has happened. the one guy seems to know what has happened and spoiler there is still electricity to some extent you see a woman use a ""computer"" at the end of the episode. im sure as the show goes on we will find out more. as for using old school weapons maybe they just wanted it for the atmosphere or they will give more details later on as to why. i mean look at firefly arguably one of the greatest sci fi shows ever they still rode around on horse back. just give the show a little time before you completely bash it there are sooo many aspects that may be explained. "
,rocdriller,2012-09-15T20:38Z,"Show kinda blows, good scripting/storline, (typical, but good). Too much candy ass, piss-poor acting from the younger crowd. Acting from the elders is good enough. But most of this acting from this younger generation in Hollywood is just so bad! I think most people would like to see better acting as opposed to this reliance on fashionability & looks. Also more realism is needs to be injected. From the action/plot/emotional scenes, etc! Just run of the mill, hollywood pork, what else is new!"
,FattHulk,2012-09-18T08:34Z,"I am probably not even going to watch this show unless it gets to season 2 or 3 with all the damn channels (especially NBC) always canceling shows right away. 

With that said.... that person that said LOST was lame is so... I don't even have a word for you. Lost was awesome and if you think it was lame then you must like balls in and around your ass hole! "
,Oort_Kuiper,2012-09-19T18:58Z,"The whole no power thing is probably going to stem from something about the electron I bet...Because an idiot can generate low amounts of electricity from acidic fruits like lemons with a couple of metal rods, so that denotes something much deeper is at play in this no electricity world."
,realpeoplepirate,2012-09-25T16:40Z,"To mmsdos- First off you said,""ok some answers"". Answers to what? Who in the fuck asked you anything dumbass :/ And if your in the enviable position of truly being able to answer any question without a shadow of a doubt could u answer me why idiots like you can read something and completely misunderstand it :P Orrrr are we just getting your ignorant opinion arrogantly spat at us? I think so.
Secondly why do YOU type ""startreck"" in inverted commas like that, I didnt spell it this way, and that is not a spelling I have ever seen for that series, proof being http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060028/
Thirdly I did NOT draw any comparisons between Revolution and Star Trek other than genre. I was simply eluding to the fact that tech that would allow a persons body with over 7 billion billion (yes billion twice, look it up) cells to be ""transported"" at lightspeed from and to craft travelling near the speed of light might just be as unbelievable as say..... tech that prevents electric circuits from working :0
Anyway if you were a thinker this should all go without saying, so we'll leave it there with a plea for you to educate yourself perhaps a tad more before trying, and failing miseraly, to flame someone whos opinions you don't even understand. Damn I need a cig after that lol"
