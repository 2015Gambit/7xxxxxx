Complex Numbers and Conformal Mappings by A. I. Markushevich in the  Little Mathematics Library.

The book acquaints the reader with complex numbers and functions of a complex argument (including Zhukovsky's function as applied to the construction of a wing section). The material is presented in a geometric form. Complex numbers are considered as directed line segments and functions as mappings. To prepare the reader to such an understanding of complex numbers, we begin with a geometric interpretation of real numbers and operations on them. The book is based on a lecture delivered by the author to high-school students. To read the book, the reader need not be acquainted with complex numbers.

    It is intended for all those who are
    interested in mathematics and primarily for high-school
    students, it can also be of use for self-education. For proper
    comprehension of the content of the book the reader must posses
    high-school knowledge of mathematics.

The book was translated from the Russian by Irene Aleksanova and was first published by Mir in 1982.
