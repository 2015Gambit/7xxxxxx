Mastercrafts 
Monty Don, a huge fan of traditional crafts, presents a series which celebrates six of the craft skills that built Britain and its heritage, ranging from thatching to stonemasonry. Under Monty's watchful eye, three hopefuls who are passionate about learning these trades are put through their paces by the country's leading practitioners of wood craft, metalwork, thatching, stonemasonry, weaving and stained glass. After six weeks of apprenticeship and labour, their work and achievements are judged by experts in their chosen field to see who has best mastered the craft.



3)  Blacksmithing 
Under Monty Don's watchful eye, three hopefuls who are passionate about learning the craft of the blacksmith are put through their paces by the country's leading practitioners. It takes four to five years to train properly as a blacksmith. During their six-week course, our trainees learn the foundations of the craft - from how to forge precision decorative panels, to making their own tools. They are instructed by Don Barker, who has made ironwork for the royal family.
