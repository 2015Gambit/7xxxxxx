Pee Wee Ferris goes straight into banging beats with P.O.S. 51 by BK and Believe in God by M & R Project. A voice tells us that ΓÇ£Twenty years ago, a dance revolution was launched in this townΓÇ¥ amongst uplifting synth, sirens, foghorns and build-ups that go places ... this mix will put ΓÇÿholes in your head.ΓÇÖ
