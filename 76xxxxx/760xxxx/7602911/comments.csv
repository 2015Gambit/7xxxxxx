 It really looks like this movie is a good movie, would love to see it in English...:) "
,rmohan,2012-09-06T06:49Z,Do not mislead people by writing english as spoken language. It is obvious this is tamil from the title itself unless it is dubbed in english.
,sree10,2012-09-06T10:02Z,Is the movie tamil dubbed or is it shooted in tamil..... coz eega is actuaaly a telugu movie... just a doubt...please reply
,VATHANi_(yd),2012-09-06T15:10Z,@sree10 : YES & NO. This movie was released in both languages at once.
,VATHANi_(yd),2012-09-06T15:16Z,"Actualy, I guess shooted in both languages like the movie SAMURAI directed by Balaji Sakthivel"
