The Pirate Bay may be the galaxy's most resilient bittorrent site, but
it is also the galaxy's most monitored and investigated bittorrent site.
I'm not running the risk of being watched and tracked, so I will not be
uploading to TPB any longer.
 
Some may ask why not just use a VPN?
 
Simple. They do not truly hide your identity.
 
VPN's are a little piece of software running from your PC where your real
IP address is. There is a digital trail leading right back to your desktop.
There is no 100% guarantee of anonymity with any service.
 
This does not mean I will no longer be uploading anything ever again;
just not anything ever again to TPB. There are a few other sites I
regularly upload all the same goodies to, so you can find the latest
tNe releases over there.
 
Besides, haven't you noticed how drab and functionless TPB is?
 
Over and out.
