Looking for non-USA members of familiarity and trustworthiness to take over this account and add tNe torrents. 

It would be an extremely simple task; get the .torrent file from another site and upload here with the same torrent description.

Whoever wants to help out will not even have to download the video files, only the very small 20kb .torrent file.  You may also download the videos for yourself as I will still be seeding new releases via seedbox."

[T],trialNerror,2012-09-08T08:12Z,"Any followers of me here can simply come follow me on kat, 1337x, or extratorrent  =D

I am not done capping and sharing; just am not feeling so safe here at the bay with all the media attention it has."
