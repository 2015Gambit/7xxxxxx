,Fantomnz,2012-09-30T00:08Z,"The Leviathan DLC shows on your private messages as a Dr.Bryson message. This happens after the Palaven mission.

If your not getting it re-install!!

(Gamers)"
,syuvial,2012-09-30T08:07Z,"even after reinstalling, i didnt receive the message that kicks off the quests. this isn't a big deal though, if you torrent the DLC elsewhere you can just drag and drop it in. 


As a side note, EA has identified this torrent and had comcast block my seeding. Seed if you can, but be aware that big brother is watching."
