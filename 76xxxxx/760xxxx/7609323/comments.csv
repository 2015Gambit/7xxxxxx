,Ravetrancer,2012-09-09T21:57Z,"Hej
Skulle man kunna få tag på den svenska texten så man kan använda den på en 1080p version?
Är ju totalt n00b på detta, om min fråga är konstig? Eller skulle Mr Stiffy kunna lägga upp den i 1080p också?

Hi
Would it be possible to get hold of the subtitle and use with with a 1080p versionof the movie?
As i am a totally n00b regarding these kind of stuff so my question may seem strange?
Or maybe Mr Stiffy could release a 1080p version of the movie if i beg on my knees? :)

Keep up the good work!!!"
