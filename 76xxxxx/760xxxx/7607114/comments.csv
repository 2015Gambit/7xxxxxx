,.Leto.,2012-09-08T01:09Z,"my god, I just finished watching it, what an aweful movie! rip quality is great though."
,Pure1080p,2012-09-08T01:44Z,hey guys whats the quality like? for 6 gig it should be crystal
,JamJulLison,2012-09-08T11:28Z,Since it says HDChina does that mean this rip came from China?  If so is the Chinese scene edited or not? I heard in china they edited out part of that.  If it is I think I will just wait for the US release. I really want to see this movie but I don't want to see any of it edited out. 
,PetaFlux,2012-09-08T14:38Z,Niggers are good in entertaining.
,legio9,2012-09-08T20:49Z,"BOZX never disappoint: always of top quality, so you are always satisfied with what you get.
Now that's what I call a serious uploader!

Now, based on quality of viewing, no matter the format:

V : 9
A : 9
M : its a question of personal taste.

Jamjulison: Fyi, the US is the one who is cutting the MOST, for various reasons: time constraints, up to to sucker you to buy a second copy ""editor collection"".. etc etc.
What you stated about ""china"" cutting portions is ridiculous (and so american propaganda)."
,boOya83,2012-09-08T22:34Z,"Tnank you :)

great upload  ..."
,wymm666,2012-09-09T00:59Z,"China cuts a lot of ""good"" scenes out because the country doesn't have a rating system, anyone can watch any movie. Not that I'm defending that system, or the lack of thereof. Just stating facts."
,PauloFran,2012-09-09T05:19Z,"Good video quality.
Thank you!"
,JamJulLison,2012-09-09T13:53Z,"legio9  I ready up on this and there is a scene in part of the movie they actually edited out cause cause some in china might find it offensive. This is only in the chinese version.  That is why I asked if it was edited in this one too.   Here is just one of many places to where you can find info on that particular censor.

,JamJulLison,2012-09-09T13:58Z,"I found one that gives more details on the cut scenes in the chinese version.

,JamJulLison,2012-09-09T14:00Z,"Looks like some of my comments were deleted or they are just not showing up. From what I have read it looks like 3 scenes, 13 min of footage was cut from the chinese version.  I just want to know if this has those scenes or not. You can google info on this if you want and find out it is true. "
,legio9,2012-09-09T22:11Z,"@jamjulison

Absolute BS!!!! One must be incredibly stupid not to know that 85% of the information on the web is either false of with such gross omissions that the true meaning of anything is lost.

I do not take the word of the web, of my neighbor, of the friend of a friend who knows my third cousin in laws: I check things BY myself.

I've played the US version I bought and this China version SIDE BY SIDE :  NO SCENES ARE MISSING.

How can you explain that?

And funny enough, on MANY Russians, Hungarians and Chinese versions I have of other movies have MORE scenes than Canadian or US version. (?!?!!)

So sorry, the ONLY thing you are saying is either BS to get attention or worst, regurgitating US propaganda for ignorant."
,FireIsHot,2012-09-10T02:55Z,"@jamjulison - For one, the ""HDChina"" is just a title, if you check the source, it doesn't say anything about it being a Chinese release, secondly if it was, the uploader would've had to change audio tracks, sync the audio with the video and would've mentioned so in the description, thirdly that article talks about a scene, that is shown in one of the 1st screen shots on here. 

So do some research before bothering people with your idiocy.

Can't Comment on A/V yet, but BOZX hasn't really ever let me down before, screens look good."
,JamJulLison,2012-09-10T05:14Z,"@legio
That is why I check with multiple sources online to verify things.  I am far from stupid and there is nothing wrong with asking a question.  All of what you have confirmed for me here with this download is what I asked. If those scenes were in this or not. I wasn't sure if this was an actual Chinese release or not. After all they also speak english there so an english release or at least a copy with english on it wouldn't be unheard of. 

@FireIsHo
As I just said, they could have included an english language track on the Chinese release.  Of course though considering this isn't released hear yet and I can't find info on a release for their yet, I couldn't be to sure what version this was. All I had to go on was HDChina.  Which is a Chinese Torrent tracker.  

http://torrents.to/sites/movie-tv/hdchina

I do agree BOZX doesn't really let us down. I prefer his encodes more then any other.  If I see his I go for it.  It is just when I am unsure on something, I prefer to ask. Never hurts to ask after all. Some people just seem to get all huffy over it. "
,Pedrojkan,2012-09-10T08:41Z,"@Fireisaho and @Lego

Take a BIG chill pill!

If you don't want to answer the question, then don't. Simple as that. Also the Daily Mail is hardly merely an internet source. Anyone with active brain functions would know that."
,Seefer,2012-09-10T09:00Z,"Praises to Jam for answering back with an adult mentality. A lot of us are guilty for going off the hinges with our replies, especially me. "
,JamJulLison,2012-09-10T18:10Z,"Thanks.  I am just an adult that was asking a simple question. Unfortunately some like to start trouble. That is life though.  There will always be someone trying to start crap.  No sense flying off the handle every time someone does that.  Anyways I got it downloaded now, will watch it later. Got some things I need to do today.  I will post back after I watch it. Just to let people know if this has all those scenes or not and to let people know what I thought of the movie. I will say this, I checked the quality and the quality is really good.  "
,JamJulLison,2012-09-10T18:13Z,"Also

@legio9
I was half asleep when I was on here last night so I missed one thing you said until now. You said you bought the US version.  Now I happen to know that is impossible unless it is  bootlegged. Simply because it hasn't been released here in the US yet. It isn't due out until November 30, 2012. So there is no way you could compare this side by side with the US release since it hasn't been officially released  yet. "

,JamJulLison,2012-09-11T07:23Z,Ok this version is the same as the US. Watched it earlier and enjoyed it. Not as good as the first movie but better then the second.  The quality is great as usual.  Thanks BOXZ
,FireIsHot,2012-09-13T00:14Z,"@JamJulLison - If he was going to get a BluRay from China, but upload it as an american copy, he would've had to swap audio tracks with a NTSC BluRay copy, so what would be the point in that, if he has an NTSC already, he would just upload that, and here we are. 

Usually these releases are either NTSC or PAL, which are pretty much identical with the exception one version won't play in the other versions player. So when downloading, it makes no difference, and if you want to burn it to a DVD use ConvertXDVD, and it'll make it work in pretty much any DVD player out there. - been using it for a couple years now.

Like I said, common sense and a little research instead of worrying because you read 2 articles online about China's stupid ass removal of a couple of ""Chinese Hate Scenes"", which I can tell you, we wouldn't be missing much. 

For someone who supposedly has downloaded several torrents from BOZX, you don't seem to know a whole lot of anything about his uploads, not once has there ever been content removed or added that is different from the NTSC or PAL version. If it was a different source than NTSC, it would've been mentioned in the description.

These are all things that should be common sense to anyone, especially an ""Adult"". You pretty much seem to grasp the concept that this is an NTSC copy, but then you seem to think that for some reason BOZX would bother to go and edit out the scenes that were in a Chinese release. 

HDChina's website is pretty much nothing related to torrents, and as for it being a tracker, it's very likely, but there are hundreds of them out there, BOZX simply has a preference for HDChina, maybe less ""legal"" issues, idk.

Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't ask questions, and I shouldn't been so harsh in my response, but what I'm saying is you should only ask questions that after using logic, common sense (which also includes doing better research). & if you still can't find your answer or deduce it yourself, then ask away.

BTW I don't blame you for waiting for a proper answer from someone, but listening to legio9, was a mistake, he clearly was lying, comparing a version he ""Bought"" to this torrent, is absolute ludicrous, any version he may have bought, would be as you pointed out later would be ""Bootleg"" not only that, it would have no baring in a side by side comparison as it would be hard to say which release he ended up with, and could be the same version as this for all we know."
,FireIsHot,2012-09-13T00:22Z,"Oh and as far as a quality rating goes for MIB3, which is all this comment section is meant for.

A/V: 9/9
M: 7

Maybe it pushes towards an 8, simply because of the acting of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, but I think a 7 is fair. 

It could've been a lot better, and I guess a lot worse, better than the second, not as good as the first, and no sequel for MIB will ever be. 

The film was so great, because of the era it was released in, the 2nd one tried to ""Update"" MIB and it failed horribly, this 3rd one tries to take you back to the nostalgia of the 1st MIB, which is a better method than MIB2, but it just doesn't work entirely.

Worth downloading or renting, maybe I'll buy the trilogy when it hits BluRay simply to own it, but by it's self, it's not worth the 20 something $."
,shadowzaxx,2012-09-13T06:57Z,really great quality and awesome movie. men in black - what do you expect :D
