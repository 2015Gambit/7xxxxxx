,aarque,2012-09-07T14:28Z,"Hello! What is the Spanish word for pirate, ""free software""? EstĂşpido y perezoso? You ought to look around, The Pirate Bay hosts trackers for ""pirate software."" Why would you waste your time uploading and burdening the tracker system by torrenting something that is freely available at the publishers website (where someone can pick and choose and doesn't have to wait for 1.58 gb just to get the liveries they want)?
http://www.precisionmanuals.com/pages/downloads/liveries.html
Do you wish to relieve the traffic load on the PMDG servers and foist it onto TPB peers instead? Is this an attempt to reward leechers who are too lazy to go out and find their own free software?"
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-07T14:45Z,"aarque, I uploaded this package because, last night, I wanted to download all the liveries for the PMDG B737NGX. I realized it is a very complicated process and take long time, because you must download liveries one by one, 97 in total, and extract each of them because they're compressed in a .rar file. Downloading and extracting 97 times is enough reason for make a package of the liveries. I realized there are more FSX players than me out there, and this can be very simple and quick.

Please, don't underestimate the work I'm doing for the FSX users. I know it is free software.
Thanks for understanding."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-07T14:50Z,"This is a PACK with all the PMDG B737NGX liveries, for people who wants all the liveries. Of course, it's not an attempt against anyhing neither anyone. Please calm down and let people decide for themselves."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-07T14:57Z,"This is for people who wants a pack of the B737 liveries, your comment has nothing to do here."
,aarque,2012-09-07T15:29Z,"The Pirate Bay is a community resource, it is not Wikipedia to be freely edited and used to ones own desires. It is not a place for ""FSX shares"" or convenience, it is a place for pirates to find pirated software.
There are many, many FSX dedicated websites (Simviation, Avsim, FlightSim.com) out there with a far vaster FSX audience than the 200 odd FSX users here at TPB. How do I know this? Because the most popular FSX torrents, things like the PMDG 737, never, EVER have 200 peers, the closest we get is the 184 seeders for the latest AIRAC.
 You could easily assemble this package, advertize it on the legitimate, dedicated websites and share it, even torrent it if that is your pleasure, without burdening TPB's trackers.
I have seen TPB crash, I have seen the search function fail from heavy traffic. It is possible to squander a valuable resource, about which you seem to have no concern.
In truth, ""your torrent has nothing to do here."""
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-07T15:48Z,"You got nothing better to do than acuse me of uploading a package of free liveries?

If my torrent has nothing to do here, please, report me, if I broke any rule, please, report me, but stop talking about what is this page for and about this is free, I ALREADY KNOW THAT, and as I said before, I DIDN'T MEANT TO ATTEMPT AGAINST ANYONE OR ANYTHING. I know what this web page is for, there is A LOT of people sharing free things in this page. I just got enought from you, do you think writting down there like you was my mom will fix this???? For God's sake, I don't give a fu** about what you are saying. Stop complaining and get a life. O-M-G."
,gemgee,2012-09-07T17:21Z,"thank you TheSpanishUploader, f**k you aarque!"
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-07T17:28Z,Thanks for the support gemgee. I'm a FSX user and I know Add-ons are hard to find and install by own experience. I only try to make things easier to the rest of you. Really appreciated :)
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-07T17:34Z,Please seed :)
,gemgee,2012-09-07T18:06Z,"YW TheSpanishUploader, and dont stop sharing... cheers!!!"
,Felidae17,2012-09-07T19:16Z,"Don't pay attention to critics. Finally they are not obliged to download.
Thanks for the actual commodity of a bundle"
,Chugalugg,2012-09-08T00:16Z,"aarque , you truly are the man! You've uploaded a shitload of great addons and given quite a few people some great assistance down through the years. This is a perfect example of why the Bay has gone to shit. These pieces of mexican trash aren't even worth a reply."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-08T00:34Z,"Welcome, I'm happy knowing I help."
,peacerock,2012-09-08T01:25Z,"Thanks for the torrent.
Does anyone have Captain Sim 777 cracked. "
,Manhole45,2012-09-08T05:06Z,"""burdening the tracker system""

lolwut?  

Thanks for the upload Spanish.  Keep doing your thing.  At the time I'm typing this, 46 people are trying to download it (with no seeders), so some are interested."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-08T14:39Z,"You are all welcome people :) Thanks for the support, it's my 1st upload, so I'm quite happy. I'm always seeding. If you got any problems to install the liveries please comment it."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-08T17:43Z,Woow good seeding people! :)
,pesho1234,2012-09-08T20:45Z,"mr. spanishuploader, thanks for the torrent, but i only wanted some of the (free) liveries and not all of them. so i downloaded the liveries i wanted off pmdg's site."
,pesho1234,2012-09-08T20:56Z,i downloaded the several free liveries i wanted off pmdg's site. for anything else - thank you.
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-08T22:03Z,"pesho1234, You're welcome. I should have put the PMDG's liveries web page, but this was my 1st torrent and I made this quick for trying. Then I realised I could not edit neither delete the torrent/account, so this stays like a ""try"" for me, but I'm pleased some people likes it :)"
,Chugalugg,2012-09-09T02:01Z,"Mexicans, what can you say....................."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-09T03:23Z,"Chugalugg, I'm spanish, not mexican ;)"
,Chugalugg,2012-09-09T04:43Z,"Same shit, Mexican, Spanish, baboon, monkey, you get where I'm coming from right?"
,pesho1234,2012-09-09T10:34Z,"SpanishUploader, cool. have a look at the client's help file or around the net for this - sometimes i come across torrents, containing more than 1 file and when you start the download, it asks you to choose which file(s) in the pack to download - all or some of them."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-09T13:58Z,"Oh, yes, I remember. The only wrong is that the files have the default name, so it's very difficult to know wich airline are you downloading. I'm sorry for that also."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-09T13:59Z,"Chugalugg, stop insulting, and don't be racist. Open your mind."
,tornade25,2012-09-15T00:55Z,"The simmers community is very small on TPB, it is not us who jam it.
You should look at the films and porn community, they post a lot of torrents, sometimes ten for the same film.
@arque : Don't upset the potential uploaders, it does not matter whether the same plane or scenery can be found twice or if it can be found somewhere else. It is very convenient to have everything on TPB, it saves time, no need to search the whole web. Everybody choses to download what he/she needs. Some simmers are bush pilots, others prefer heavy liners, etc."
,TheSpanishUploader,2012-09-15T17:22Z,"@Tornade25 I totally agree. I wish some day FS add-ons will be all here in TPB, with no need to search more. For me this is  the simplest way to download FS add-ons, so I always look for them here first."
