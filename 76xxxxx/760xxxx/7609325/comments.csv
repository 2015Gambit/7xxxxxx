,catfly,2012-09-08T23:44Z,"Too right, the cover of this sez it all.. badly lit obviously cut & pasted into a river, this is the quality of the movie, i need see no more. Thx for the upload though :) "
,Caricas88,2012-09-09T01:48Z,Why the hell are they with torches in the middle of the day?
,prettynerdy,2012-09-09T06:03Z,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Poor Charisma Carpenter..."
,jamisonman,2012-09-09T23:49Z,"They have torches to fend off  the wild life that want to cause them trouble. 
The cover is obviously photoshop but the actual movie is much better. 
Charisma Carpenter refuses to do any nude scenes, she will never. 
Like many actresses, posing in bikinis and showing almost everything is ok, 
but god forbid either one of the small circles of skin about 1 to 2 inches in diameter actually see the light of day, 
because you know logically that would change everything. 
Fuck*ing women and the stupid stuff they have come to believe in...  "
