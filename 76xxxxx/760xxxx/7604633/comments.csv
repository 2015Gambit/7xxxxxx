Do yourself a favour and read the .NFO. It's amazing what you find in those things, like passwords to installs even.. RTFM 

Installed, followed instructs, up and running, thanks, been waiting years for this!"

Instructions: (paraphrased):
1. ran keymaker
2. launch app- used password provided
3. there was no fields to provide bogus info
4. There was no dropdown menu to choose ""manual activation option.""

at the end of installing - when i try to start the app it immediately had a screen that says ""no valid serial # found"" - i can't find anywhere to even attempt to input the serial #.  Stuck! please help!"
