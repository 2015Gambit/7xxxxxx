"FrameForge Previz Studio 3 enables you to create a virtual 3D set in your computer with the freedom to place any number of virtual cameras in any placement, angle or height desired. Each camera features full Pan/Tilt, Dolly, Zoom, Roll and Crane control with the options to limit focal length to a specific zoom range or set of prime lenses, limit minimum and maximum heights (due to equipment limitations or physical ceilings) to accurately portray the actual range of your equipment.

Its 'behind the scenes' power and filmmaker friendly controls will empower you to experiment and discover the very best shots to capture each story moment.

FrameForge is not about your mastery of the pencil but more how you can explore and see what your actual equipment will see. Find your artistry here and it's in the can!"

This program is generally used for the creation of camera shots for movie directors.
