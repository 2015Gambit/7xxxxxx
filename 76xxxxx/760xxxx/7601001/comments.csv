,SiMoNKAiN,2012-09-08T21:48Z,"This album is undisputedly the worst dmx album released to date......i am a huge dmx fan but i had every single song on this album a year or more ago minus slippin again....over all....the production was absolutly horrible and dmx sounds az tho not an ounce of soul was put into this record....this comeback album may well have sealed X's fate as a washed up rapper with no hope left.....7arts entertainment should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this.....Az 4 X.....only dre can save your career production wise now, and itz up to you to come with the gruff aggressive style that made u a legend.....Get at me dog....Arf!!"
