So on Wednesday Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles and chair of the convention, turned business over to former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, who is co-chairman of the convention who introduced the resolutions. They were flashed on the screen, and Villaraigosa called for a two-thirds voice-vote necessary to pass these amendments.

The first voice vote was ambiguous - there wasn't a discernible winner between the 'ayes' and 'nays.' Villaraigosa looked puzzled and asked for second voice vote. The second vote was clearly NOT even half in favor. The whole thing suddenly froze up, a puzzled Villaraigosa seemed paralyzed looking around for help. Someone started to walk up on the stage. He then called for a third vote which was the same as the two previous ones - a house clearly divided.

He then quickly said "the eyes have it", declared the amendments to have passed as the "no's" shouted, got up and waived No and stood up. The couple with the sign "Arab Americans for Obama" was clearly very angry!

This was a real unexpected improvised explosive political event.
