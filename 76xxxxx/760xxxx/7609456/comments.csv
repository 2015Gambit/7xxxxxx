,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2012-09-07T13:31Z,"Hi Ms. F. I take it that you're saying that there's no show on Friday? And you say that you'll be back Tuesday. Is there no show on Monday, or do you mean that you'll upload Monday's show on Tuesday?

Have a good weekend, everyone. I follow Australian Rules Football, and my side, Collingwood, is in the finals. But it's getting a hiding. I'll lose myself in the drama of Victor's amnesia, I think..."
