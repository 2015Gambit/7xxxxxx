,dhod4ever,2012-09-04T23:54Z,"@Lazycrockett
Works for me. just copy the program in your Main Sims 3 directory not in your Sims 3 Supernatural directory."
,Lazycrockett,2012-09-05T06:44Z,Well I think I'm going to wait till someone besides the uploader says it works.  No offense.

,dhod4ever,2012-09-07T13:58Z,"@g33kyg1rl

you probably click the Magnets links ""Get this Torrent""
(Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client.)"

i updated my game to 138.151.018002 then i downloaded this patch then i copied it to the sims 3 folder and i ran it but when i run the game there's nothing happen 
what is my problem ?"

Copy this program in your SIMS 3 BASE GAME.
The Sims 3  Game  Bin (TS3W.exe and TSLHost.dll must be there) then open the program. Then open the TS3W.exe to play.

don't paste this program in your Expansion pack folder or stuff pack folder. Either you have expansion or stuff packs, always crack the Sims 3 Base game. Hope this helps your problem ^_^"

Sometimes outdated MODS results black screen and major conflicts. Try to remove your MODS or download the latest one. I've never heard in Sims 3 forum of a crack in sims 3 that cause it crash.

""If the Crash or bugs still exist, follow this step.""

1. You need the ""The Sims 3"" (BASE GAME) before installing any expansion pack.

2. If you have a MOD items or MOD programs, remove them before installing a any Sims 3.

3. turn off your internet when installing a Sims 3.

4. DO NOT INSTALL THE ORIGIN! a.k.a Electronic Arts Download Manager (never ever ever ever!) ""If you do... Good Luck! hahaha!""

5. When cracking the Sims 3 with or without expansion and stuff pack installed, always paste the crack in ""Sims 3 BASE GAME"" (do not paste the crack in any expansion/stuff pack folder or your game will crash)

Follow this instructions and call me liar if it didn't work! :))

PS: About the STEP 4 above, if you actually install the ORIGIN (a.k.a. Electronic Arts Download Manager) then your'e in the worst position ever. Even if you uninstall ORIGIN, it still wont work. You need to clean your computer Registry for SIMS 3 to work again. ;)"
