[T],theburningbush,2012-09-14T17:28Z,"Another vote for...

... The.Burn.S01E05"
,Old_TV_Rocks,2012-09-16T19:08Z,"I'd love more episodes of The Burn.
I'm a huge roast fan and I'm really enjoying this series.

Here's hoping, and thank you for the other episodes!!!"
,culo_mahogany,2012-09-19T09:23Z,"While we're at it, I'd really like to see the Jeff Ross Roasts America comedy special.  It seems like roasts are prejudiced against on the pirate scene..."
[T],theburningbush,2012-09-20T20:51Z,"Weird.

The.Burn.S01E01-E04 were all UL'd in a relatively timely manner.

But now it seems we're destined to never see The.Burn.S01E05 or The.Burn.S01E06, the final two eps of the season.

Weird."
