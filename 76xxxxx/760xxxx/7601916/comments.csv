,SilentTuber42,2012-09-06T02:51Z,Is this legit?
,bert16,2012-09-06T03:56Z,"I haven't leeched this yet, but I'm seeing that many of these activators depend on whether or not a KMS server is up. If it is, you're in business, if not, you're screwed. The other way is to have a serial number that hasn't been blacklisted and calling on the phone. I trust one day there'll be some sort of Daz loader for W8 to put an end to this gargage."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-09-06T21:06Z,"I can confirm it works nicely with Win8 Pro x86, but does not work with x64!? :( Please, the maker of this activator, please make it x64 soon?? :)"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-09-06T21:09Z,"x86 is useless today, just scrap x86 and go over fully to x64?? Wasnt MS supposed to do that already with Win Vista???????? Cmon, if you have more than 3gb (i have 8gb) ram, then x86 is useless. So please x64 activator is so wanted.

I tested this activator on both x64 and x86 versions of windows 8 pro on Vmware 9."
,nosdratos,2012-09-07T01:21Z,IF YOU USE THIS IT WILL LOCK YOU OUT. USER PROFILE IS NOT RECOGNIZED!!! 
,nosdratos,2012-09-07T01:24Z,DO NOT USE IT WILL LOCK YOU OUT!!!!
,tarlac,2012-09-07T02:01Z,"Unfortunately this is the same useless activator that was uploaded by android.androyd on Sept. 2. It does not activate windows 8. Evidenced by personalization still being locked. All it does is generate windows script dialogue boxes that say it is activated permanently. If it was genuinely activated personalization would be unlocked. It does say activated in the computer properties, but you will notice that it does not display the ""Genuine Windows"" icon on the right side of window next to activation message. To the leecher that says it will lock you out. That is absurd, it does not ""lock"" anyone out, neither does it really activate. Wait until KMS servers are up, hopefully later this month. "
,Thatsme50,2012-09-08T00:40Z,tarlac you are such an idiot for one the is only a 32 activator and for two any lamerz out there that dont believe this activator is real go to microsofts website and try to download windows media player 11 for widows xp if you dont activato windows 8 it wont let you download if you do activate windows 8 when you download WGA it will allow you to then download WMP11. easy fuckin way to know if its legit I activated windows 8 32 bit with this activator and now even after 2 years foward on my clock I can still download any WGA content.
,Thatsme50,2012-09-08T00:45Z,Second note to all idiots on here x86 versions of NT 6 and later fully support up to 64 gigs of ram it just says it doesnt its just a stupid mind fuck by microsoft
,tarlac,2012-09-08T01:45Z,"Dear Thatsme50, you are full of shit. What makes it worse is that your grammar and spelling are ridiculous. Perhaps you should refrain from posting in public forums until you finish your elementary school education. Also I would love to see some screen shots supporting your absurd claims of activation with this rehashed useless code. If you need me to give you instructions on how to do that, I will be happy to explain. (P.S. How the fuck could you submit a comment with spelling errors. Perhaps you don't know that the text box has spell checker?)"
,tarlac,2012-09-08T01:48Z,"Oh, my bad, numbnuts thatsme50 also seems to know more than Microsoft about its ram specs. What a dbag. LOL"
,topjimmy68,2012-09-08T06:04Z,"@tarlac:  Those of us in the know, know you're right.

@thatsme50:  This hacktivator is crap.  From an elevated command prompt, run ""sfc /scannow"" reboot and see what happens."
,Anirudh28,2012-09-08T10:08Z,"I installed and got activated,

,Anirudh28,2012-09-08T10:10Z,"I have activated Windows 8 with this, still can't personalize lock screen?
Anyone know how to unlock it?"
