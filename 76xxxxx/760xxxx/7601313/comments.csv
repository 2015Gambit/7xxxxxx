,Rigel71,2012-09-06T07:44Z,"Why don't you fuckwits shut the fuck up. Jesus christ, she looks TIRED. That's all. If you don't like it why the fuck did you upload it?"
,shdwolf1,2012-09-06T11:27Z,"Thx guys for the upload. Didn't care for it; didn't look like she was into it.
As for you @Rigel71, these ""fuckwits"" are the people who bring these sets to you, so show some respect! Ungrateful people like you are why so many stop uploading. Plz, take your own advice; if you don't have anything nice to say, stfu."
