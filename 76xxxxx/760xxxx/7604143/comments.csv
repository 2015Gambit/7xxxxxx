Also alot of people that like blitzkrieg also like the sudden strike series. I have all those as well including hidden stroke. I also the last sudden strike 3 patch released that work correctly. If you go to any website and download the final sudden strike 3 patch its screwed and makes all units in game not able to be destroyed. Took me 2 years to find 1 that works right."
