   Lots of Major mods with new campaigns (example Battle of the Bulge) Solo and multiplayer maps and missions. As well as files for Mission Barbarossa. I made a custom file for Mission Barbarossa and Mission Kursk, the add0ons for Blitzkrieg made by the developers of Blitzkrieg. I liked the format of the Original Blitzkrieg. Barbarossa and Kursk are MUCH harder. So I made a custom file to make them play more like the Original Blitzkrieg. If anyone feels like me and likes the original gameplay let me know and I will upload Barbarossa and Kursk with my mod already installed in the game.
