

This torrent includes the first arc of the latest Fables spinoff out of Vertigo, Fairest. Each arc will be done by a different creative team and focus on a different "fairest of the land".  This first arc is written by Bill Willingham himself, with art by Phil Jiminez.
Both c2c and noAds versions are provided.
*Note: I plan to release update torrents after the conclusion of each Fairest story arc in the future.
========================================================


New York Times best-selling, award-winning creator Bill Willingham turns the spotlight on the female FABLES--spinning secret histories of Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Cinderella, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, Snow White, Rose Red and others. They may be beautiful, but there will be blood.
