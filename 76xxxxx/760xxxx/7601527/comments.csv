,hollyyyy,2012-09-05T20:32Z,"So I have been using your torrents for quite sometime I absolutely love that I can trust they will always work :) But I have run into a problem D: I will tell you step by step what I did so far so you can let me know if I did something wrong; First I downloaded the torrent, opened it and extracted the files. After the extraction I opened the SIMS3EP07SETUP file and entered the code and then I get to this error: ""Please insert Disk 1 that contains the file Caches/MoonlightFalls.ObjectCache"" Please help!"
,hollyyyy,2012-09-05T20:37Z,me and little girl slept well :) i love you too but i'm kinda sad because some girl came by the house this morning and apparently wants the dog. She's been a stray since we moved here either that or that girl doesn't take care of her :( but i'm going to talk to the girl and if she is sure she wants her and will keep her inside i'll let her take her but if we see her running around the park again i'm going to take her back

3. turn off your internet when installing a Sims 3 expansion pack or stuff pack.

4. DO NOT INSTALL THE ORIGIN! a.k.a Electronic Arts Download Manager (never ever ever ever!)

,missgothika,2012-09-17T03:28Z,"Games4theworld always gives me the best games and without any trouble. Just a few tips for the simers: 

1-Don't be an ass, buy the base game so you have the original one and don't have problems updating. download all the expantions packs instead.
2- ALWAYS keep the ORIGINAL files you ""reeplace"" don't just copy and paste. Simply change the names of the original ones for "" name of the file + original"" then paste the crack.
3- Always run without custom content. It's a waste of time and game performance.

Those simple 2 steps will save you from a lot of headaches."

Tried to burn it to a disk, nothing. Help please~?"
,XxLoneSurvivorxX,2012-09-25T00:04Z,"Installing this today.
Hope it works!
P.S: Do NOT EVER download full package sims files. I tried, bugs EVERYWHERE.

Also for anyone who wishes to ACTUALLY play the game, use PowerISO to mount this when its finished.

,XxLoneSurvivorxX,2012-09-25T00:08Z,"For Hexbreaker: State your problem? Is it because you cannot mount? Bug? Installation problem? Cant figure out if the base game is valid? Answer!

For missgothika: Funny, I've downloaded the base game, sims 3 ambitions, AND currently downloading The Sims 3 Supernatural. All for free. I've found a way to also update the sims 3 base easily. And also, I can be able to download and express my own custom content."

,Octopod1,2012-09-29T02:37Z,"So I'm trying to help my Ole Lady get this working.
She followed the instructions exactly except for one thing. there is no ""Sims3"" folder anymore under
 C:program files(x86)electronic arts

There is only Sims3 Pets, so she tried to paste the crack under

C:program files(x86)electronic artssims3 petsgamebin

Every time she tries to run the game it says ""No game disk found, please insert the Sims 3 Supernatural game disk before proceeding.""

Another thing..
In the Installation guide, it said to copy the file ""TSW.exe & TSLHost.dll"" and the file that was under the crack was ""TS3W"" not the TSW.exe

And she actually bought the base game and the Pets expansion. 
Can someone please help us out?
It would be much appreciated. "
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-09-30T00:59Z,"@octopod go to my computer, then double click local disk c:, then go to program files, then go to the electronic arts folder, inside there you will see all the sims 3 ep and sp folders double click on the sims 3 folder(base game), then double click the game folder and click on Bin ...inside there copy and paste the crack files ....finally play the game :)
i hope this helps "
