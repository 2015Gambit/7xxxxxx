Notes:

Well to sync it all up short and sweeti used the 720P instead of the 1080 wich i honestly couldnt tell the difference. As good as it was it was noisy, blotchy everywhere, dull and dark, so i cleaned it but couldnt take all the noise out otherwise loss a quality so i cleaned it to how i saw fit rgb not a smooth a real denoiser tyvm brightened it up the usual stuff i do. So Enjoy a True Quality encode frrom CrEwSaDe!
