I found I needed the wiring diagrams for my '95 Taurus, but that they were not uploaded here. Once I had found them for myself, I decided to correct that oversight. The .rar file contains a text index and a number of .pdf's, each containing one section of the diagrams covering one system (power windows, headlights, or cooling system; to name a few). I hope somebody else will find this useful.

Share and Enjoy.
