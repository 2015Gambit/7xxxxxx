Requirements: Android 4.0+
Overview: HaxSync allows you to sync your Facebook friends and Events with your Android 4.0 device!


This gives you an experience similar to the Google+ one, complete with status-updates and high-resolution contact images in the People App, Events and Birthdays in your device's Calendar.

READ THE FOLLOWING LINES OR YOU WON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT!

How to use:
1.) Go to System Settings => Accounts & Sync (Android Settings, not Facebook App Settings).
2.) Click "Add Account" => HaxSync.
3.) Confirm Authorization
4.) Wait for HaxSync to finish syncing.
5.) You should now see your Facebook contacts in the Android "People"-App.

What's in this version:
Fixed issue in the cropping code that could cause Contact Sync to stop.
