        AUDIO - Special friends ( new audio )
Notes: Ok here we go with yet another fooking dark knight release lol ...oh well they
keep getting better and better and would be rude not to enocde this nice cam
The video was in 2 parts...also there is some slight cam movement which we have opted
to leave in so the AR stay right and also when viewing in full screen or on a tv you
can hardly tell,only in still shots you can tell
Also the video on cd1 needed to be pull out at the sides aswell as all the normal
filtering crap we all do Cd2 was more levelled up,but just needed a slight
perspective fix
The colouring seems to change in parts,sometimes bang on,other times a tad yellow
...so filtered it slightly,by trying to make the white parts look white
( see plane screenie,looks white to me so )
So merged the the two parts have been together ....just incase ya was wondering

So then it came to syncing the Audio which was a pita to do as we found some
small segments missing not much mind max 60secs which we added in from our
previous release. Audio was then cleaned and filtered. This was a pita to do but
we got there in the end and its all there now ;-)

Enjoy what should be the last encode from us until r5 or retail
