,senseinai,2012-09-07T01:59Z,Flood is right ... many thanks for these libraries you are providing. I'm hoping you might be able to get the new Christopher Hitchen's Mortality.

     Do you have anything by Etgar Keret ?"
,lilone006,2012-09-07T16:40Z,"Wow! Awasome! I love your downloads! 
Is there any way you can do a collection of the V.C. Andrews books? I can't find a good source (the one on here isn't good at all). And possibly Mary Janice Davidson's Undead and Unstable? Can't seem to find that one either. 
If not, thanks anyway :-) Will seed these. "

,BCwader,2012-09-07T23:32Z,"Have looked through all 20 of your book floods (fantastic!!) and haven't spotted any books by C J Cherryh (Foreigner series, currently up to book 14, also Alliance-Union universe, et al) or by Lois McMaster Bujold (Vorkosigan saga). Would appreciate any of those, if possible."
