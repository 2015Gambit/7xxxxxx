Thanks for a good response i got for my first torrent, here i am with the next documentary. This one is even more interesting and is about an Epic battle, that Allies(specifically Americans) won but it was worse than a victory. Although i dont agree with the allied military doctrine of that time just like this documentary says, yet this is an interesting documentary. 

I am much more fascinated about this topic and so i wrote an article about this on Ezine articles. and you can check that article here...
