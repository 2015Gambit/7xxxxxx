,imjustwow,2012-09-06T20:50Z,@Rehman5000....ones you rename any torrent file/folder that you have downloaded it won't allow you to seed...so better keep your downloaded folders/files unaltered if you want seed continuously!!
,Emengardo,2012-09-07T03:19Z,"@Rehman5000 it is possible depends of your client, if you use uTorrent version 1.8 or later, take a look on this site http://filesharefreak.com/tutorials/utorrent-rename-files-and-keep-seeding or this for bittorrent http://lifehacker.com/5612315/how-to-seed-moved-or-renamed-files-in-bittorrent ....
Sorry for my bad english... 
thank you YIFY for your work"
,Rehman5000,2012-09-07T10:50Z,"Thank you ""Imjustwow"" and ""Emengardo"". I've always wanted to return the favour, but couldn't do it as I have to move my files around frequently. This definitely helps. Thanks again, and sorry for the double posts."

,FureeTutawk,2012-09-17T04:08Z,"Rehman5000, if those measures don't work for you or you end up being too lazy to go through all the effort every single time, you could STOP moving the files. Do you uninstall and reinstall your torrent manager all the time? No? Then why are you moving the files all the time? Simply download them to one directory in the same directory you have your torrent manager.. and when downloaded leave them there. Then, copy and paste them to the directory you want to keep them in and move them from and keep them in again and move them again and keep them in another time and move again some other time.. while the ones being seeded stay with your torrent manager."
