,pxpierre,2012-09-06T03:32Z,"From rottentomatoes:

""The found-footage horror genre branches out into family-friendly territory with this modestly budgeted action-adventure thriller [in which the victims] are so sketchily characterised that you barely register their presence before they meet their demise.""

I'll drink a few Scotch before watching it. :-)

Thanks uploader AND seeders!"

,klip1,2012-09-06T20:04Z,"Anyone who would call Jurassic Park a ""fail movie"", is nothing more than a degenerate. FYI

A/V = 9

M = 3

And this is coming from a huge Jurassic Park fan. :-X"
,PetaFlux,2012-09-06T20:27Z,It must be the worlds firs dinosaur movie without one fucking single dinosaur?
,pauonepunch,2012-09-07T01:01Z,PetaFlux - What are you talking about?  It wasn't a good movie but there were sure dinos in it.
,Pdid,2012-09-07T04:20Z,I love dinosaurs! And that is why I hate this movie. If you like pet dinosaurs and terrible acting go ahead. The dinosaurs were decent looking though.
,JAG_ACE,2012-09-07T14:21Z,"Gonna need some weed to watch this one i think, and a beer.  (^-^)d

,eurasian_farmer,2012-09-10T02:42Z,"OMG.....They're REALLLLL!!

The Discovery Of A Lifetime Has Become A Fight For Survival!

Rated 12, when PG would have been jussssst fine.

Download only if you have NOTHING better to do.

Trust me, you have SOMETHING better to do than watch this."
,asdfkjjj,2012-09-10T15:24Z,"A/V 9/9  Movie is nowhere near as bad as the reviews, its on par with SyFy's movie of the week stuff (it's a low bar, I know). +1 to the uploader, thanks."
,ankstjart,2012-09-12T00:48Z,"well this movie wasn't good...
Not worth to watch."
,Rex199,2012-09-16T18:56Z,"Despite having a low budget, this movie still proved itself. A applaud and recommend it."
