The story of Pel√≠sky, a.k.a. Cosy Dens, takes place in the Prague suburbs over the period of time leading to the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968. The setting is ideal for a political drama, but Czech artists prefer to make a comedy with political background. The story is told in such a warm, witty and funny way that it reminds us of the golden years of Czech movie making in the 1960s and early 1970s.
