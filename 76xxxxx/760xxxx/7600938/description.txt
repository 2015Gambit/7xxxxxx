Issues 1-5 of 'Serenity Rose'
Slave Labor Graphics, 2004-2005


Serenity Rose Vol 1 - Working Through The Negativity
Slave Labor Graphics, 2005, 128 pages
This is the same story as Issues 1-5, but with slightly different art. This version was not scanned, but instead collected from Aaron's website with the images then being enlarged via a photo editor. No doubt a scanned version would look slightly better(you can buy the TPB on his website), but this still looks quite good.


Serenity Rose Vol 2 - Goodbye, Crestfallen!
Slave Labor Graphics, 2009, 124 pages
This version was not scanned, but instead collected from Aaron's website with the images then being enlarged via a photo editor. No doubt a scanned version would look slightly better (you can buy the TPB on his website), but this still looks quite good.
