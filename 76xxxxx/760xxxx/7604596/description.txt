A 3rd person stealth-action title pitting a covert agent against opposing forces in real-life missions from WWII. Smersh is Russian for "Death to Spies" and was the name of a set of counterintelligence departments in the Soviet Union formed during World War II. Their mission was to secure the rear of the active Red Army by arresting traitors, deserters, spies and criminals, as well as perform intelligence operations including stealing important documents, eliminating different enemy officers or high-ranking officials, kidnapping and sabotage. During the war these agents became the main force combating the German intelligence service. Game missions are based on historical events and operations executed by the Russian military intelligence and counterintelligence during the war.
