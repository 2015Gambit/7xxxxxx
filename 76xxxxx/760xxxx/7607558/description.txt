This time Max and Stacy discuss the world's richest woman and how the dingo stole her sanity. They talk about the children of the Crimson, kletographers and the interregnum of insanity. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Catherine Austin Fitts about Libor crimes and item number 17 on the GOP platform and what they mean for the future of the world economy.
