"This introduction to the native language of Sweden features 10 lessons which are ideal for both classroom use and self-study. Each chapter includes dialogues, basic vocabulary and easy-to-follow discussions of grammar. The book also comes with exercises, cultural information and a brief comparison of Swedish and English. The two 80-minute audio CDs feature dialogue, vocabulary and sections spoken by native speakers."
