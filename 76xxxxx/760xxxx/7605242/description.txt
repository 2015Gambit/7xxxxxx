Following his triumphant conducting of Havergal Brian's `The Gothic' Symphony last year, Martyn Brabbins brings another British magnum opus to the Proms. Herbert Howells wrote Hymnus Paradisi `for the drawer' in the wake of the tragically early death of his son. Only years later was he persuaded to release a finished score to the public.

After this light-filled memorial from a composer closely identified with Gloucester Cathedral, we revisit the masterpiece that, in 1908 - the year of the first London Olympics - announced a Worcester man's arrival as perhaps the greatest of British symphonists.
