,hulivar,2012-09-13T06:50Z,"I wouldn't download this one guys.  It cuts off with 15 minutes left on the show...I never download stuff and get errors so I'm guessing this is uploader error.

I'd download another copy for sure.

I doubt I'm mistaken but if I am sorry"
,cycowolf,2012-09-13T07:15Z,Same thing for me. Cuts off 15 minutes from the end. 
[V],tonyisaac,2012-09-13T07:27Z,@hulivar You're right! This version is NUKED! Have to wait for the re-pack.
,ammory25,2012-09-13T08:03Z,There's something wrong! it stops after 1:38:40
,sdweasel,2012-09-13T08:25Z,"Same thing happened.  It froze near the end.
ETTV has always been reliable, and never before got a defective file. Just a rare  error I think."
,Violentos,2012-09-13T08:36Z,"Yup, don't download this ladies and gentlemen. It cuts off near the end."
