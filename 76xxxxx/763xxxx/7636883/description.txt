On top of the countless hours represented by the game developers who created
the Super Nintendo's original library and the ROM hackers who have made the
dumps and various patches, this particular packaging of files took over a
week solid to piece together.  This is not due to the size of this package in
itself; there are larger packages with more ROMs to be had, several of them
boasting completeness.  It was, rather, due to what was left out:
         
     * If there is a valid ROM and a bad one, the bad one is left out.
     * If there is a trainer ROM and a normal one, the trainer is left out.
     * If there is a hack or an overdump, those are left out too.
     * If there is a translation into anything but English, it's left out.
     * If there is a E(uropean) version and a U(SA) version, E is left out.
     * If there is more than one translation, all but one is left out.
     * If there is a U/E release or translation, the Japanese is left out.
     * In general, for any game in the package, only one ROM is left in.

Meanwhile, there is no shortage of actual games to play.  In point of fact,
there are a total 1337 ROM files in the package.

This includes the entire original Super Nintendo library, including Japanese titles. It also includes the very best of recently-created homebrew SNES games (the 81 hacks) and 134 games that have been translated to English by players.

The games are categorized by quality to save you time finding good ones.


**** Mini "Getting Started" SNES Emulation FAQ ****

1.  How do I play a game?

You should unzip either "snes9x-1.51-win32.zip" or "zsnesw151.zip" and
launch the executable, then load your game of choice by clicking on its ZIP.
Note that neither SNES9x nor ZSNES want to be "installed"; they just run.

2.  How do I use the controls?

If you're unsatisfied with using a keyboard (and I don't blame you), there
are a gamut of alternate input devices available to you, ranging from USB
corded controllers for the PC, to adapters for original Nintendo controllers,
to the controllers for the PS3 and Xbox 360.  If it works in your operating
system, it will work in SNES9x and ZSNES.

3.  How do I use an ISO file?

You can mount it with something like "Daemon tools" or burn it to DVD.
Mounting lets you copy it to your hard drive without using a disc.
This torrent is a repack of the original containing all the files in
a single ISO file. (The Pirate Bay doesn't like its torrents to have over
1000 files in general.)
