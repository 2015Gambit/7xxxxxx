,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-15T23:47Z,RIP Bill Kennedy aka Kill Bennedy.
,mike.braedley,2012-09-15T23:50Z,Subtitles? Really?
,mascan42,2012-09-16T00:18Z,Is it available without subtitles?
,PirateNinja222,2012-09-16T04:21Z,"Everybody that is downloading this: You should already be using VLC Player (or something like it that plays everything and gives one many options) so that you can play the file and maybe more importantly for some of you, remove the subtitles, which luckily are not hardcoded."
,kevduch,2012-09-16T05:28Z,Love the subtitles. You rock DibyaTPB. I always wait for your copy of stuff. = )
,johnniebrasco1,2012-09-17T00:01Z,"non- hardcoded subs? is this what folks are complainting about? Just disable the subs. Is that really that hard? you can do it in most players. In mpc - right-click on screen, subtitles, disable.......
I was starting to think something was wrong with the torrent, since lots were looking for non subbed versions. 

Anyway, thank you DibyaTPB!"
,rockyjones1,2012-09-19T20:43Z,"I tried Media Player Classic (my usual media player) and Windows Media Player. Neither allowed me to disable the subs. Installed VLC and it did let me disable the subs. 

kinda weird, but you CAN disable them."
,fluffus,2012-09-20T06:21Z,"If you are using Nero MediaHome (LG TV media server), and slinging it to TV, there doesn't appear to be any way to turn off subtitles."
