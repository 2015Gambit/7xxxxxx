Quanta, Matter, and Change:
A Molecular Approach to Physical Change

Peter Atkins, Julio de Paula, Ron Friedman

Beginning with quantum mechanics, introducing statistical mechanics, and progressing through to thermodynamics, this new text for the two-semester physical chemistry course features a wealth of new applications and insights, as well as new Mathematical Background inter-chapters to help students review key quantitative concepts.

"This is a splendid book. True to the authors' philosophy as outlined in the preface, it approaches physical chemistry by first developing the quantum theory of molecular electronic structure, then by statistical arguments moves into thermodynamics, and thence to kinetics."
