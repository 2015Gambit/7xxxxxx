[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-17T02:01Z,LOOKS LIKE YOUR ACCOUNT GOT HIJACKED MATE . I HOPE ALL YOUR UPLOADS DON'T GET DELETED . 
,w4v3m4573r,2012-09-19T03:44Z,How do you know his account got hijacked?
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-20T23:37Z,"Your account was hijacked a few nights ago mate . the reason I know is because there were about 30 - 40 uploads of latest release movies that have not been out yet . I looked back to see previous uploads from you and knew straight away it was not from you . 
And i posted on each of those fake uploads that it was a hijacked account and begged for whoever was going to delete the fakes not to delete all the previous genuine ones . and since you are still here and the fakes have been removed all ends well my friend ."
,CompuTerror,2012-09-21T03:08Z,Ok. Thanks
[H],EverybodyLies,2012-09-21T09:02Z,"As your account got hacked 3 times already:
1. do some serious scans in your PC. if needed use safe old clean restore point to restore the pc into virus free state.
2. after you have done that change every single password on every single site you have. for the love of god:
a. use different password for every site
b. the password should be minimum of 15-20 char long,
including upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols"
,CompuTerror,2012-09-24T06:11Z,"Thing is that this is a fresh install and I have no illegal programs at all on this computer.

The password should be safe and this is the only site I've been using it on and it's only here my accounts get hijacked.

I never have problems with malware and test applications in sandbox the few times I use 'em."
