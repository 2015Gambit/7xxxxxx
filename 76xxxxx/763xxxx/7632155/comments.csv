YIFY is slipping!  More and more torrents are lower in quality!"
,The012Freak,2012-09-14T21:16Z,"@Nearsighted_Scrappile 
I have seen the movie, their was no encoding error for me at  1:37:50 it must be your computer, I agree with you on the  pixelated at 1:37:50, it only lasts for 5 to 6 secs, it won't ruin the movie."
,upx3,2012-09-15T02:04Z,"How's the audio quality ?
YIFY has snuck in a couple of Region C BluRay rips in the past -- without an RC in the title.
But his work is usually awesome -- much appreciated."
,xidio,2012-09-23T03:31Z,"Its pixellated even on his screenshots you morons.
YIFY is not about quality, its about compressing the shit out of the movies so they look bad."
