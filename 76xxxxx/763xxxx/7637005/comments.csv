Your lists deserve more attention. So keep up the good work. I am already looking out for the following lists. Thanks."
,one_of_7.500.000.000,2012-09-15T15:41Z,Agree. Seeding for a year now I noticed these lists were less popular than some random crappy ones. I also noticed that Soldier (Angus and Julia) had 2500 uploads (record!) and hardly any comments? People are people I guess. Thanks for the perfect lists.
