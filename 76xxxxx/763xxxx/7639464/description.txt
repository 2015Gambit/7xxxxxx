September 14, 2012


Because of partisan gridlock in Washington, the Supreme Court has become the most powerful and outspoken branch of government ΓÇô decisions they make shape our democracyΓÇÖs fate for generations to come. Now, one has only to look at Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and the Affordable Care Act rulings to understand why some call it a ΓÇ£one-percent CourtΓÇ¥ ΓÇö dedicated by majority rule to preserving the power and influence of a minority of wealthy special interests.

In this episode, The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel and Jamie Raskin, constitutional law professor and Maryland state senator, join Bill to discuss how the uncontested power of the Supreme Court is changing our elections, our country, and our lives. The two joined forces for a special upcoming issue of The Nation entitled ΓÇ£The One Percent Court.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£We wanted to bring attention to how this court has empowered the 1% at the expense of the 99%,ΓÇ¥ says vanden Heuvel. ΓÇ£How it is now working for big business, for corporate power against the interests of ordinary citizens in this country.ΓÇ¥

Also on the program, Bill talks with Craig Unger, author of Boss Rove: Inside Karl RoveΓÇÖs Secret Kingdom of Power, about RoveΓÇÖs behind-the-scenes maneuvering to once again affect the outcome of a presidential election.

ΓÇ£Most people thought he was a creature of the Bush family,ΓÇ¥ Unger tells Bill. ΓÇ£I think heΓÇÖs a force more powerful than that.ΓÇ¥
