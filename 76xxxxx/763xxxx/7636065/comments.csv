,Jisnit,2012-09-20T11:29Z,"This file is not XVID at all, it's encoded as H264! It has been badly mislabeled. Actual stats:

Video format: H264
Duration: 1:03:18
Frame rate: 23.976fps
Dimensions: 720 x 400
Audio: MP3 44100Hz 128 kb/s tot, Joint Stereo

The quality itself is fine, but if you intend to play it on an XVID only capable device you'll be disappointed and will have to convert it."
,Jisnit,2012-09-20T11:42Z,This is 720 x 400 H264 not XVID!
