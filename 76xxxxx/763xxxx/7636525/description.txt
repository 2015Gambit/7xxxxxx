Jim, the cheapest Chinese American dude in LA, has recently been left by his fianc√©, Katherine two weeks before their wedding on Valentine's Day. In order to ease his pain, he asks his long-time best friend and ex-con, Alex, to kill him. Alex reluctantly agrees to give Jim his wish, but he doesn't think its a good idea to do the job down in LA. So Jim and Alex begin their journey with a trip up to Jim's Aunt's cabin in the mountains, under the strict condition that all business is to be taken care of before Valentine's Day.
