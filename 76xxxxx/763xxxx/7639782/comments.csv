,killbat,2012-09-15T22:46Z,6 seeders and 200 peers..... Way to hit and run.
,trace535,2012-09-15T23:02Z,"EZTV doesn't do xvid releases anymore, so try TvTeam and stop asking."
,moonrunner99,2012-09-15T23:20Z,"@killbat eztv posts tons of stuff, and always seeds well, it takes time for the trackers to update."
,Bekuz,2012-09-15T23:32Z,"@BUTT_SEX

You have been bugging EZ for the past 3 weeks about his / her Dr. Who uploads, if you don't like his / her torrents, shut up and go somewhere else.

EZ ..Thank you for the Uploads! "
,mike22656,2012-09-16T01:52Z,"   This Butt guy has been bothering everybody about changing the format. He is to lazy to convert it himself so he whines continuously. He d/l all over the place and wants everybody to do the work for him, he isn't happy that they at least put it up for him in the first place."
,Babysly,2012-09-16T02:06Z,"BUTT_SEX just download the fucking codec and stop whining! Stop being a spoilt little bitch, if you don't like it, don't download it!"
,Freak3142,2012-09-16T02:21Z,Thank you so much! Love Dr Who!!!!
,BAEast,2012-09-16T02:48Z,"@BUTT_SEX

This is the new standard. They are not going to change just because you want them to."
,waygooda,2012-09-16T05:37Z,"Once again, THANK YOU!!! :)"
,Alfazaargonian,2012-09-16T05:54Z,"Thanks man for this

,xboxhaloalive,2012-09-16T06:35Z,no shit butt_sex go fuck yourself again
,MyKrossini,2012-09-16T09:13Z,a/v 10/10. So I don't know what changed from last week and the week before but this episode does not play on Xbox 360. Works just fine with VLC. I liked the FoV rips a little better because whatever the format was it worked with Xbox. That is all. Thank you eztv. 
,nuwanda13,2012-09-16T17:32Z,thank you!!!
,Patriotcrossroads,2012-09-16T17:47Z,Thanks for the download!
,turntechGodhead,2012-09-16T22:58Z,I too would prefer AVI
,bash2112,2012-09-17T02:12Z,"Great upload!
Perfect A/V.
If anyone's having the same problems as @BUTT_SEX Start using VLC as your default media player."
,SaveCash,2012-09-17T02:22Z,"V10/A10 Streams great from my computer to Xbox as media extender. 

I love this new MP4 based standard! It really looks so much cleaner and it has less hiccups streaming! 

Thanks EZ for your part in sharing, and please thank the ""Chef"" for me!"
,RSDS,2012-09-17T02:33Z,"@turntechGodhead 
I've never understood why people aren't just grateful for any working format. Its not hard to convert it yourself"

,skulldragon,2012-09-20T20:58Z,"@mike22656 
Not everybody is a newrich to purchase themselves a supercomputer or even find valid, understandable, in human language info about programs and on how-to convert."
,trace535,2012-09-21T06:43Z,"@skulldragon

Don't give us this crap about needing to be rich to afford a computer capable of encoding. All computers made in the last 5 years can re-encode video with no problem, because they are all at least dual-core CPUs with 2 or 4 GB of RAM.

And why are you proud of not knowing how to do something? Just download this, and pick the xvid codec with the .avi format, at around 1000 kbit/s bitrate, then click convert.

,Sphenisciphile,2012-09-23T20:22Z,"about neeeding a new computer to do mp4...B.S.  I have an OLD laptop (1.8GHz single core CPU, 512MB RAM), and I rip & convert DVDs to mp4 all the time (and upload the torrents on TPB). There is a whole shit-load of free and easy one-click converters out there if using Avidemux, Megui, AutoGK (all also free) is too complicated. Another good freebie is Freemake Video Converter."
,ManguProff,2012-09-24T04:25Z,thank you so much !
