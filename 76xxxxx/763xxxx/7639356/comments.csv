,niarlttep,2012-09-19T10:54Z,"I tried to get it twice and I got ""Error.Please Verify Local Data Piece # 558 is corrupt"".
What can I do?
I don't know how to Verify.
I don't know even how to localise ""Local Data Piece # 558"". What can I use for that? To disassemble and to reassemble.
Thanks for help"

If you run Mountain Lion, make sure, in the Preference Pane, menu : 'General', bottom, under title : 'Authorize downloaded apps. from', to check last option = 'Anywhere'.

In other news, the file you download is a .zip one. You can download the 'Unarchiver' (at the MacAppleStore, or elsewhere, for free) to un-zip it smoothly (as well as many other compressed files). You get two zipped folders, one for TechTool Pro 6 app. and the other for the Keygen app., you can open too by the Unarchiver. Everything worked fine for me that way."
