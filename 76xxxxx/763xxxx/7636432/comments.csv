Richard Gere still has it... very suspenseful.

,BPeppy1,2012-09-18T23:07Z,"Fellow seeds & peers:

I downloaded the sample & NFO files & here's the deets.  AXED (torrent source) writes that the source was a 720p wmv VOD rental.  The sample looks excellent.  It has a resolution of 720 x 384 at 192 kbps.

GREAT film that isn't quite what you expect. Decent cast, good enough pacing. Worth the watch. 

A/V = 9 M = 8"
