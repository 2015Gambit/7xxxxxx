,peeyoosh1,2012-09-15T16:06Z,thank u for small size rip.
,nibal2,2012-09-15T22:34Z,"Great!

A/V: 8/8

Comparable to Axxo movies, but not to hires ones.  If you share how you did it in such a small space, other uploaders might follow suit!

Keep it up!"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-16T02:03Z,"Rubbish,  so typicall for rookies who knows shit. My encode, especially THIS one, is BETTER or equal to ANY other encode of the SAME title. I KNOW - because I have downloaded and watched ALL current Prometheus encodes out there.

How you speak rubbish (and for sure have no idea how I could say that) is fact how you compare something that do not exists to something you can see or watch or evaluate.

Keeping in mind THE SIZE ratio of present 370 MB to many other 2 GIGABYTES or bigger DVDrips - V20/A20 or better should be used.

There is NO Hi-Def release of this title, Yet. None. Just DVD-R and now a Retail R2 DVD.

Keeping in mind your call to ""other encoders"" is a proof how you really have no clue who the fuck I am, for how long I am who I am, and shows your inability how by keeping your mouth shut you serve the world much better than spitting your short-sighted and endlessly moronic shit."
[T],bzingaz,2012-09-16T07:59Z,"man o man ..u r pissed.. but one thing is sure..this one is a great copy..if i would say v=20,a=20 that wouldn't be wrong..thanks..+1 ..much better than all other large sized uploads."
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-16T12:19Z,"Not really, I just follow 'quid pro quo' by letter or as my father taught me few decades ago: ""If somebody treat you bad, bad is what you should give back"".

You have seen how I treat good, civilized people. I don't know, really don't Why in hell people jump out of anonymity Internet provides by - being evil, stupid instead of - been better than they are in any other venue of their life.

Honestly, I prefer Nothing over Stupidity. 
Seeing morons who spread their insanity all over I simply wont tolerate some judgment coming from total strangers.

Asking total strangers for guidance and advice is most stupid thing anyone can do."
[T],bzingaz,2012-09-16T13:49Z,i agree with you..Sometimes people annoys u more than one can handle..

Man! Where does this come from? I try to complement you on your effort, by using expressions like ""Great"" and ""keep it up"" and you reply with ""moronic"", ""rubbish"", ""shit"" and ""fuck"".

I guess it pays to be nice;-). You are right I don't know who you are and you don't know who I am, and i am no rookie. But that doesn't seem to stop you from calling names.

I didn't judge your title compared to the other Prometheus uploads, since these change daily. but to other titles I have seen. And both the audio and video are not the best, especially at the openning scene - to be expected given the size. 

BTW the best is 10/10, not 20/20 as you may wish."
,LJE111,2012-09-17T08:29Z,"Seriously twentyforty - what are you on? The guy was paying you a compliment. And what's wrong with sharing or helping your fellow man? 
"
,doyll49,2012-09-17T17:42Z,"Will give it a bash.  

Thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-18T08:02Z,"@nibal2: Well, you obviously did read my response but you haven't understand it (no wonder).

And from own stupidity (there is no other or better words than one I used) you continue with spitting chapters of ""Diaries of One Moron""."
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-18T08:04Z,"@LJE111: ""compliments"" and ""fellow man""?
LOL. I am ON nothing, but you are OFF from day you are born, tough."
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-18T10:24Z,"OK, here is something repeated many times:

Some man, you have never seen before walk straight in your home, right to your dinner table, fill the plate, ate food you bought and your wife cooked and after he has finished, tells

""Thanks for the meal, but your cooking is so-so,  mediocre at best, I ate better ones in top restaurants ""

""But"" - house owner said - ""you wasn't invited, you eat it all anyway, and you look like a street bum or hobo and are these ""top restaurants"" in Paris maybe?""

""Watch your mouth mister! I do not allow to be called hobo. I am very smart, slick and rich."" - told street-bum, obviously disturbed.

He left, but...

He came over next day to take a dump on a porch.

""I am very, very nice man. You should stop treating people bad."" - he left a message aside the load of shit."
,shaggy.ray,2012-09-18T10:24Z,"@twentyforty

[V],twentyforty,2012-09-18T11:42Z,"Do not take me wrong but - do you think how asking for Request right here and right now is - appropriate?

Reading and answering and dealing with idiots made me meek and warm, right?"
,Kjellberg2008,2012-10-03T23:07Z,"@ twentyforty haha u made my day with the hobo food mumbojumbo, thanks for the torrent!"
