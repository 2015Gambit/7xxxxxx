The Secret Series is a series of books written by Enid Blyton. Jack, Peggy, Nora and Mike are four children who, in their first adventure together, run away from strict guardians after their parents are thought to have been killed in a plane crash. The children make their way to an island on a nearby lake, and together they make a new home constructed with the branches of a willow tree. The much-loved "living house" is one of the highlights of the first book, The Secret Island, which was originally written as a serial and, in 1938, published as a full-length novel (one of her earliest, preceding all the The Famous Five, The Five Find-Outers, The Adventure Series, The Secret Seven, and school books to come).

The Secret Island
The Secret of Spiggy Holes
The Secret Mountain
The Secret of Killimooin
