,bryx0,2012-09-13T21:34Z,Thank you!
,kuzamuki,2012-09-13T23:04Z,will be uploading the MoP update right before the release of the game?
,TheFreeRevolution,2012-09-14T00:21Z,I'm not sure if the 4.0 release will include the MoP stuff as it comes out on the 24th (MoP being released on the 25th) If it does then I'll update it then. If not when I guess we will have to wait till release day.
,kuzamuki,2012-09-14T00:58Z,The release before Cata included cata leveling. And I'm sure 4.0 will include MoP since the Zygor team have been playing the beta
,husn2503,2012-09-14T17:59Z,"thanks alot for the update, 
as Zygor guide website and Wow main website showing the count down, Zygor guide will release the guide 5 hours before MoP go live in servers. 

hope you can make it TheFreeRevolution, and thanks again for this update."
,psyched,2012-09-19T03:47Z,"Excellent thanks for the updated guides TFR, as i said before i dont have a zygor account so had to do a patchy job. ill download this and check the guides and merge/cross link here if its got the same number of guides."
,psyched,2012-09-19T03:53Z,"crosslinked from mine, looks like you have most of the guides that i had"
,sundaychutney,2012-09-24T06:20Z,"@TheFreeRevolution: The patch on the 24th has all MoP content, will you be uploading it? If you do, I'll be eternally grateful. "
