"Sunday Night", later named "Michelob Presents Night Music", was an NBC late-night show which aired Sunday nights at 11:30 for two seasons between 1988 and 1990. The show featured performers in a wide variety of musical genres but was particularly known as a showcase for jazz and electric music.
It was hosted by Jools Holland (only first season) and David Sanborn, and featured Marcus Miller as musical director.
Guests included acts such as Sonny Rollins, Shinehead, Sister Carol, Sonic Youth, Joe Sample, Slim Gaillard, Pere Ubu, Pharoah Sanders, and many others. In addition, vintage clips of jazz legends like Thelonious Monk, Dave Brubeck, and Billie Holiday were also featured.
The show also featured a house band of Omar Hakim (drums), Marcus Miller (bass), Philippe Saisse (keys), David Sanborn (sax), Hiram Bullock (guitar), and Jools Holland (piano).
The show often allowed its guests ample time to explain the origins of their sound, meaning of songs, etc.
It also provided a national audience for lesser known acts (like Arto Lindsay's band The Ambitious Lovers).
Hal Willner was the music coordinator, responsible for the interesting musical mix-and-matching that took place on the show.
