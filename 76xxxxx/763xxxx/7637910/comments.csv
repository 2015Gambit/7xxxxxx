[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-09-16T19:33Z,"on media player classsic click on view-then click options
internal filters/audio switcher-then alter the number in the box usually set at zero up or down dependant on the problem.basically the value in the box is in miliseconds & you need to determine if the video is b4 the audio or the audio is b4 the video-if your`e stuck simply google the problem for proper pics n stuff,its simple 2 do-remember 2 go in afterwards & reset to zero"
