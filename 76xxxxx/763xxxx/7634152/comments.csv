,marshall1982,2012-09-14T10:27Z,Come on guys 454 leechers 22 seeders?
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-14T10:34Z,what is wrong with the colors in the vids u upload.the quality is perfect but red is mad bright and the wrestlers are like a red/orange color??if u dont mind can u fix it cuz i noticed it in all ur uploads.still ur a great uploader but has any1 else noticed it?on both my laptop and my tv it looks like that.
,SCSA420,2012-09-14T14:16Z,I don't know what you are referring to as the 720p video looks fine here on my PC and also on my LG 55 inch 3D LED Smart Tv. 
,sarjampc,2012-09-14T18:28Z,Have the same problems with your downloads- Video quality is amazing but WOW on the maxed out colors
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-14T22:04Z,lol i new it wasnt just me.idk if u have the color setting or contrast to high but it does distract u.again ur uploads are amazing and i dont want u to freak out at me but the people who download ur uploads wwe/tna would like ur uploads a lot more.thanks for always uploading tna and saturday morning slam
,SCSA420,2012-09-15T01:53Z,OK I will tell you what I'm going to do here I'm going to adjust the color saturation on my HD capture card from the default setting of 115 down to 85 which is a difference of 30 and I want you and others here to tell me if they can see a difference however IF it looks like the colors are washed out on my LG 3D LED Smart HDTV then I'm putting it back to the default setting because like I said earlier the video looks perfectly fine here on my expensive state of the art LG LED HDTV equipment. Please download the WWE Friday Night Smackdown 2012-09-14 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH show release and let me know if the change made any difference.
,ThatTunechi,2012-09-15T02:23Z,ok thanks like i said i love ur work ever since u switched to mp4 i just wanted to know if its just me.it just bothers me a bit cuz it looks weird. also how dont u have a skull yet??u been uploading for a bit now.i always give u a plus 1 and still no skull
