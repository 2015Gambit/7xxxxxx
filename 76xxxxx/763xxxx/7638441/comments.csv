,BoonesFerry,2012-09-15T14:12Z,"Does not matter who the torrent group is (eztv, sceneline, or tvteam, etc.)
If the scene release ""Strike Back S03E06 HDTV x264-2HD"" is oos then its oos regardles of what torrent group distributes its."
,MicSokoli1912,2012-09-15T23:50Z,"Yeap, it gets out of sync badly from minute 20, don't download it it is unwatchable, though I've tried to watch it with a standalone player (WDTV),
This is the first time that I have troubles with eztv uploads. Thanks to the team anyway, shit do happen sometimes."
,mwalsher,2012-09-16T00:42Z,"Mic is correct; it gets out of sync less than half way through, and not even by just a little, it gets *BADLY* out of sync to the point that it is completely unwatchable, even if you are only watching it out of the corner of your eye (which works for minor sync errors, but not this)."
