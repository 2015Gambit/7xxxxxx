Prager 20120912    3 No More Apologies

Prager H3... Dennis returns to his discussion of the multiple crises in the Middle East. 
 LetΓÇÖs stop officially apologizing for things we didnΓÇÖt do. Bowing to the cultural sensitivities of Islamists
 is not helping anyone, including MuslimsΓÇª Why wouldnΓÇÖt the President meet with the Prime Minister of Israel
 during his visit to NYC?


Prager 20120912    2 Male/Female Hour: Open Lines

Prager H2... Before callers weigh in, Dennis states that one clear advantage of marrying young is that you share 
 a lifetime of memories. Questions include: do you believe husbands should stay in shape for their wives;
 why do you say that a successful marriage takes luck; with the power of the visual in men, 
 if a woman is a regular occurrence in a husbandΓÇÖs life, how should a wife handle that?


Prager 20120912    1 Murder is Worse

Prager H1... A Youtube video supposedly attacking Muhammad, sparked protests against U.S. interests in Egypt
 and Libya yesterday. In Libya, the attackers killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
 Dennis talks with Daniel Pipes, President of The Middle East Forum, about the past 24 hours.
 Dennis reminds us all that murder is worse than mockery, and that we, as a country, have nothing to apologize
 for with regards to this situation.
