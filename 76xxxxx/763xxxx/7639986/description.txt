Overview: MIUI X4 Theme PRO/DONATE for Go Launcher Ex
The Icon Pack is also compatible with NOVA Launcher AND Apex Launcher

This is a PRO/DONATE VERSION of the Theme, there is also a FREE VERSION in the Market. It takes a lot of time and effort to create this Theme and if you would like to honor the hours I am putting into adding activities and Icons to the Theme buy the Pro/Donate Version. All Icons are free of use and can be found in my Blog or on XDA in the Miui V4 Project Vexillum topic.

FREE Version = up to 677 Icons
PRO/DONATE VERSION = more than 1553 Icons

I am splitting it up because at one point there will be too much Icons to change it by hand. GoLauncher will crash because of too much Icons loaded into the Ram. I love my Icons and never changing any Icon. Therefore, this Theme it is split into the FREE Version with 677 Icons, where everybody can change the Icons and the PRO/DONATE Version where every week are added more and more Icons. But be aware that the Pro/Donate Version can't change Icons when 800 Icons are exceeded.

This Theme is based on the MIUI V4 Theme of ProjectVexillum at XDA. I created some Icons by myself and will do it also in future, but it is a Community Project.
