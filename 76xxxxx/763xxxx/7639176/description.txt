Producer/director/screenwriter Angela Schanelec adapts Anton Chekhov's The Seagull into an existential drama concerning a self-absorbed actress who returns to her lakeside home on the edge of Berlin following an extended absence. It's been some time since Irene (Schanelek) has seen her family, and after a brief stopover at home she decides to pay a visit to her bigoted brother Alex and her young son Konstantin. Konstantin lives with his uncle Alex, and strives to become a successful writer when he grows up. Before long, Irene also runs into next-door neighbor Agnes, who is currently spending summer break with her parents. Though Irene has recently taken a new lover, everything back home seems strangely stagnant yet decidedly different in a way she simply cannot pinpoint. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
