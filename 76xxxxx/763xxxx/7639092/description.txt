The title tells you what you need to know. On an off-night on their 1981 tour, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ron Wood and pianist Ian Stewart stopped by ChicagoΓÇÖs Checkerboard Lounge to watch blues legend Muddy Waters perform.
 
Before too long, Jagger was called up to join in on ΓÇÿBaby Please DonΓÇÖt Go,ΓÇÖ and eventually all four Stones had crowded onto the tiny stage to add their reverent but loose style to traditional classics such as ΓÇÿHoochie Coochie ManΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿMannish Boy.ΓÇÖ
 
Luckily, someone thought to film all of this, and seeing Jagger, Richards and company so gleeful around their mentor and in such an intimate setting is quite a treat. A slight warning: this concert is best enjoyed by those who love the blues whether or not the Rolling Stones are performing them. This is a Muddy Waters show with the Stones frequently but not always joining along. Jagger doesnΓÇÖt come on until the sixth song of the 15-track set, for example, and at one point briefly returns to his table to watch his bandmates work their magic without him.
 
Throughout the night, the spotlight is shared equally with the Stones, Waters and ΓÇö later in the proceedings ΓÇö fellow honored guests Buddy Guy and Junior Wells. The Stones are revealed to be well-studied in the blues traditions, of course, but you can also see how they canΓÇÖt seem to help but put their own stamp on things, pushing the night into less retrained, rougher and more dynamic territory.
 
If you love the genre, ΓÇÿLive at the Checkerboard LoungeΓÇÖ is likely the most concentrated dose of Rolling Stones blues music youΓÇÖre ever going to see and hear. ThereΓÇÖs even a bonus track ΓÇö ΓÇÿBlack LimousineΓÇÖ ΓÇö from a ΓÇ£properΓÇ¥ stop on the StonesΓÇÖ ΓÇÖ81 tour, showing how the full band took the sound born in tiny clubs onto the worlds biggest stages.
