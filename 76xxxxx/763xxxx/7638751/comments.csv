,Bren0,2012-09-16T16:55Z,"thebox.bz is normally the place to go for anything F1 but for some reason no-one has been capping and upping The F1 Show to that site in recent times. 

Many thanks for posting up here. Those of us who don't have access to Sky's F1 coverage rely on good folks like you to pick up the slack. Great work! 

Long live tpb! "
