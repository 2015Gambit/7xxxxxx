,antignor,2012-09-16T00:42Z,I have serious doubts about the integrity of this uploader. 
,jwalche,2012-09-16T01:55Z,There isn't such course yet. Perhaps it came from future?
,tomas1933,2012-09-16T15:14Z,"jdonovan101, you bastard, what a piece of shit is that ? "
,jimbuck2,2012-09-16T17:57Z,"The link above goes to a course called ""Trails of Evidence: How Forensic Science Works."""
,jimbuck2,2012-09-16T18:11Z,"A search on The Great Courses site turned up nothing for ""The Cold Shoulder"".  The only meteorology course TTC offers is ""Meteorology: An Introduction to the Wonders of the Weather""; no subtitle or even chapter named Cold Shoulder."
,JVLIVS,2012-09-17T14:47Z,"Obviously a fake! Do not download! New TTC courses are provided by user ""dohduhdah"" or others with skulls. Also, the files are always video ones, not ""img""."
,serialdownloader,2012-09-18T01:24Z,"A comment by a user on his only other uploaded torrent called ""CProgrammingTutDVD"":

""This ISO has nothing to do with C programming. It's a collection of videos and zip files about Israel. It's too bad the uploader used deceit in his title to mislead people into thinking they were getting programming tutorials. This content is all political. ""

So, yeah, given the above it's safe to say that this isn't a mislabeled torrent but 100% a fake."
,serialdownloader,2012-10-03T12:07Z,"LMFAO, people still downloading this sh*t..."
