||			ABOUT:				||
||							||
||	UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group that sucks at	||
||	releasing on time and in good quality. They	||
||	do what they can, but without hdtv feed or	||
||	any prior encoding experience, they receive	||
||	more complaints that compliments. We do try!	||

||	The quality might not be the best (standard def	||
||	sucks, amirite?) but we do try our best to	||
||	deliver shows the scene or other P2P groups	||
||	don't. We also upload releases to cyberlockers	||
||	to download but once they're gone, they're	||
||	gone!						||

||							||
||			GREETZ:				||
||							||
||	Greetings to all scene and P2P groups we've 	||
||	viewed material from. Thanks for your hard	||
||	work and dedication. We realise the scene	||
||	dislikes P2P for numerous reasons but hey,	||
||	we're noobs and have to start out somewhere,	||
||	right? Think about that. Peace. -UNPOPULAR	||
