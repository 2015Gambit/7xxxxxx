This is UpToDate 19.3 in HTML format, not the application itself, which is better for few reasons like:
1. Needs no crack
2. Has no errors!
3. Can be used virtually by any device... including android and iPhone (using iFile or something similar)

The original application looked neater than this format, it had good features like CME and history of previously read topics.

The original subscription with UpToDate has calculators, drug interactions, and some good stuff you find in any other site...

But to weigh things up, this is free, and UpToDate is cool for its contents; text, figures, tables, images... all these are included here and easily accessed.


Finally, I CLAIM NO CREDITS FOR THIS, I only downloaded them (which was a painful process) and like to share them in an easier way...
