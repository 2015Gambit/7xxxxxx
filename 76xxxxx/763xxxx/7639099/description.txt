Black Mesa (formerly Black Mesa: Source) is a Half-Life 2 total conversion remaking of Valve Software's award-winning PC game, Half-Life.

Black Mesa Research Facility is an ultra-secret laboratory under government contract, conducting top-secret and extremely volatile experiments. You play the role of the scientist Gordon Freeman, a Black Mesa employee. This morning, as usual, you make your way to the research facility for a run-of-the-mill experiment. However, when the experiment initiates, you realize that it might not be as ordinary as you thought. Odd things begin to happen as you make your way to one of the Black Mesa test chambers. Even weirder things happen when you start to move the test sample towards the antimass-spectrometer...
