,JennM42,2012-09-15T17:55Z,Downloading. Will seed for a few days.
,athanh8807,2012-09-16T07:00Z,"Your version included new Patch ???
Yesterday, I realize this when I try play on steam.

(srr for my bad Eng)"
[T],esharoth,2012-09-16T10:30Z,"A patch? I can't find any information about a patch on the official website or forums. 

If a patch comes out it will be easy to install and I'll probably make an easy to use installer for it."
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2012-09-16T10:59Z,Thanks esharoth for the full repacked release. Excellent work.
,draske73,2012-09-16T21:35Z,Nice job. Works like a charm. Thanks lad. 
,FredRoll,2012-09-17T20:54Z,"Hey, I get the error message ""Can't find background image materials/console/startup_loading.vft. Do you know what is the problem and how to fix this please?"
[T],esharoth,2012-09-17T21:25Z,"Yes, always make sure that Steam is closed before launching the game (completely closed, not running in the background)."
,VitorCz,2012-09-18T07:20Z,this need the source 2007 base?
,draske73,2012-09-18T08:55Z,"Nope. Everything is ready to play, just install."
,darkshadow666,2012-09-18T13:50Z,Thank you!
,FredRoll,2012-09-18T15:20Z,Thanks man! Would you also happen to know how to get up the console? I tried -console in the tool bar for the shortcut but didn't work :/
[T],esharoth,2012-09-18T15:59Z,Options > Keyboard > Advanced > Enable developer console. Then just press ~ to open/close the console.
,justsomedude84,2012-09-19T23:12Z,hey im getting an issue on (i think) chapter 4 Blast Pit after i get on the tram and it crashes the screen turns blue (black if the flashlight is on) and i cant see anything unless i fire a gun in which case i can see for a second but everything is in a dark red hue i was wondering if anyone else had this problem and knew of a way to fix it
,VitorCz,2012-09-19T23:45Z,"everything is okay, then i close the game turn off the pc and go to bed, then when i wake up i turn on my computer, and what? could not find shit/shit/shit/startup_loading.vtf"
[T],esharoth,2012-09-20T10:48Z,"justsomedude84: you're not the only one having that problem, check the official forums.

VitorCz: maybe you set Steam to start with Windows? Steam must be fully closed (not running in the background) to play the game, otherwise you'll get that error."
,nexuszord,2012-09-26T03:53Z,"Hey when I start this up it gives me an error about missing materials, does this game require hl2 materials? Or is it ABSOLUTELY standalone? because I am putting hl2 materials in atm."
[T],esharoth,2012-09-26T09:13Z,"It doesn't require anything else, just make sure Steam is closed before launching the game."
