Review from CDUniverse:

Greatest Hits is a terrific compilation of 22 digitally remastered Henry Mancini favorites, including his soundtrack themes "Peter Gunn," "The Pink Panther Theme," "Love Theme From Romeo and Juliet," "Mr. Lucky," and "Breakfast at Tiffany's," among many others. The collection also includes well-known Mancini tunes like "Moon River," "The Days of Wine and Roses," "Baby Elephant Walk," and "Dear Heart" to name a few. The sound is crystal clear and the track selection demonstrates over and over again Mancini's gifts for melody and mood. Overall, it's probably the best single-disc introduction to Mancini's work yet assembled. ~ Steve Huey
