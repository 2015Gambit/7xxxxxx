 Around Sound Pro allows you to listen to music and still be aware of your surroundings.
What it does:
*PRO Version ONLY* Street Mode:ΓÇ¿
+Walk down the street and only hear the noises above the set trigger level. Never interrupts your music.
Pause Music Mode:ΓÇ¿

+Uses your headset's microphone to listen for loud noises and pause your music if one is detected, then play back the sound that triggered the pause and continues for a short period of time the optionally resumes your music.

Where would I use it?ΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿
At the office: pause your music automatically when someone is trying to get your attention
At home: Don't miss door slams, children crying, your dog barking, or other warning signsΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿
At the airport: Relax at the gate and have your music pause when the gate announcements startΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿
Anywhere relatively quiet where you want to know if something happens around you

Best to use with:

    Sound isolating earbud headphones with mic
    These are practically earplugs now, so don't miss out on what's around you.ΓÇ¿
    You can use it with just headphones but be aware the microphone used is now your phone. So leaving it in your pocket wouldn't work so well.
