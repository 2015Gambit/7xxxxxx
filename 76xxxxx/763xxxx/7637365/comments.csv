,Smaq_ajm91,2012-09-15T16:28Z,"Greetings everyone, Islam is a religion of peace and harmony. It came at a time of ignorance and wars. It teaches us different ways to solve various disputes between opposing parties and not only It is conservative, It also shows us how to live in the modern world and encourages us the get educated. A tradition in Islam says,""To get educated is obligatory for every Muslim"" Another states,""Get educated even If you have to go to China"" (In the those days China was known to be the farthest place ever). And about technology the first principles, law and theories of science were given by Muslim scientists. Non-Muslims just deducted other modern laws from those principles laws and theories."

,antignor,2012-09-15T16:46Z,"Those few radicals that oppress whole countries are not every muslim. But many more average and really peace loving muslims should stand up against those radicals that can't distinguish between some filmmaker or cartoonist and an entire country and its government.

If muslims want to live in freedom they should stand up for freedom, which means accepting opposing views. When someone publishes something they don't agree with you shouldn't resolve to violence. That's a stone age attitude. Discuss the problems with arguments. Maybe the latter is the problem, they lack the arguments so violence is all they have left.

If you can't stand criticism in this information age, just unplug your internet connection!

I'm an atheist but I do respect every religious person who doesn't solve problems by violence and doesn't oppress people to make them do what they want to do themselves. And I oppose governments, no matter where they are on the world, that think they can solve their problems by violence as well. Violence only radicalizes people more."
,antignor,2012-09-15T18:12Z,"@Smaq_ajm91
This Great Muslim science myth is for the largest part rubbish. To begin with, it was not Muslim science, it was Arab ""science"". And science did not start in the Middle East as you seem to depict it, it started in China, India and mainly in Ancient Greece. Just because 'chemistry' comes from an Arab word doesn't make it much more than alchemy, even though they sometimes went beyond. The Middle East played a role in science like many other regions in the world did, but was no great instigator. That  honor really goes to the ancient Greek. Much of pre-existing knowledge only passed through the Middle East, they combined some and added some and only when Europe struggled free from Christian oppression it could finally flourish in full light.

This is the message one should take seriously: There is no Muslim or Christian science and no Jewish, no Hindu science and no Buddhist science. There is only secular science (which turns out to be atheist science) even if the scientist doing it is a Muslim, a Christian or a Jew. All orthodox and fundamentalist beliefs do is work against science and only seem to embrace scientific progress when they can use it to blow up people.

So don't start about your phantom ""Great Muslim Science"" ever again where I can read it. "
,evolveplz,2012-09-15T19:50Z,"""...the first principles (of technology), law and theories of science were given by Muslim scientists. Non-Muslims just deducted other modern laws from those principles laws and theories.""

i.e. Westerners would still be living in caves without Muslim people.

That is how those people think.  

Is there any hope of reform when someone is that fucked up?  

At least the Jews just believe everyone else to be not much better than animals; Muslims believe that it is ok to kill, torture, enslave, copulate, with any non-believer (no non-believer is innocent).

There is no co-existence with people who hold such beliefs.   

Westerners can't give Muslims what they want because they want all of us converted or dead.

The only solution is to isolate them and let them roll in the mud for the next 2000 years. "

,evolveplz,2012-09-19T00:28Z,"Sorry for the length but this is the best analysis I've ran across-

So let's get this straight: In the consensus view of modern American liberalism, it is hilarious to mock Mormons and Mormonism but outrageous to mock Muslims and Islam. Why? Maybe it's because nobody has ever been harmed, much less killed, making fun of Mormons.

Here's what else we learned this week about the emerging liberal consensus: That it's okay to denounce a movie you haven't seen, which is like trashing a book you haven't read. That it's okay to give perp-walk treatment to the alleged—and no doubt terrified—maker of the film on legally flimsy and politically motivated grounds of parole violation. That it's okay for the federal government publicly to call on Google to pull the video clip from YouTube in an attempt to mollify rampaging Islamists. That it's okay to concede the fundamentalist premise that religious belief ought to be entitled to the highest possible degree of social deference—except when Mormons and sundry Christian rubes are concerned.

And, finally, this: That the most ""progressive"" administration in recent U.S. history will make no principled defense of free speech to a Muslim world that could stand hearing such a defense. After the debut of ""The Book of Mormon"" musical, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints responded with this statement: ""The production may attempt to entertain audiences for an evening but the Book of Mormon as a volume of scripture will change people's lives forever by bringing them closer to Christ.""

That was it. The People's Front for the Liberation of Provo will not be gunning for a theater near you. Is it asking too much of religious and political leaders in Muslim communities to adopt a similar attitude? "
,evolveplz,2012-09-19T00:29Z,"It needn't be. A principled defense of free speech could start by quoting the Quran: ""And it has already come down to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation."" In this light, the true test of religious conviction is indifference, not susceptibility, to mockery.

The defense could add that a great religion surely cannot be goaded into frenetic mob violence on the slimmest provocation. Yet to watch the images coming out of Benghazi, Cairo, Tunis and Sana'a is to witness some significant portion of a civilization being transformed into Travis Bickle, the character Robert De Niro made unforgettable in Taxi Driver. ""You talkin' to me?""

A defense would also point out that an Islamic world that insists on a measure of religious respect needs also to offer that respect in turn. When Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi—the closest thing Sunni Islam has to a pope—praises Hitler for exacting ""divine punishment"" on the Jews, that respect isn't exactly apparent. Nor has it been especially apparent in the waves of Islamist-instigated pogroms that have swept Egypt's Coptic community in recent years.

Finally, it need be said that the whole purpose of free speech is to protect unpopular, heretical, vulgar and stupid views. So far, the Obama administration's approach to free speech is that it's fine so long as it's cheap and exacts no political price. This is free speech as pizza."
,evolveplz,2012-09-19T00:31Z,"President Obama came to office promising that he would start a new conversation with the Muslim world, one that lectured less and listened more. After nearly four years of listening, we can now hear more clearly where the U.S. stands in the estimation of that world: equally despised but considerably less feared. Just imagine what four more years of instinctive deference will do.

On the bright side, dear liberals, you'll still be able to mock Mormons. They tend not to punch back, which is part of what makes so many of them so successful in life.

Yes! USA have during a long era since the 19th century search for resources to feed its growing population and especially the industry. Several multinational corporations have been born in the US, who continues to lobby for more resources to extract. The Saudi and bin Laden families are among them who is heavily involved in this search for riches. These families are deeply involved in the filthy salafist/wahhabi movement just so that they can gain control of the minds of other human beings! Do you want them to rule your life? By playing their game on their terms, you are doing exactly that!

Look at latin america, africa, china! USA have had business in them all. Every great power search to gain more resources and power. We see clearly Saudi arabia in this struggle for power, as they fund the despicable salafist movement.

To just say that one side is guilty, and be BLIND and DEAF to the faults and problems from the own side is just hypocracy! Many want to leave Islam, why arent they allowed to do so?

HYPOCRACY!"
