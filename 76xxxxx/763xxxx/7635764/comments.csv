,Em3rgency,2012-09-14T16:25Z,"Woah nelly, 2500kb/s up :D People want it bad..."
,KaidoM,2012-09-14T16:25Z,"Make sure you seed this one, so It can live. Unlike Mofs torrent."
,Em3rgency,2012-09-14T16:28Z,3 people have already finished. Hopefully someone can confirm it for everyone elses peace of mind? :)
,NavyK,2012-09-14T16:36Z,Its work fine ! Thanks :D
,markofbear,2012-09-14T16:37Z,"Heya guys, as always if you like the game buy it, its a really awesome game and as most indie devs i think the more money we throw at them the better games they will make in future! Their homepage is: http://www.ftlgame.com/ and also on steam of course! :D"
,Coram,2012-09-14T16:38Z,Seed lads!
,ForeignMustache,2012-09-14T16:40Z,"I honestly feel bad for downloading this since it's only 8$ on http://www.gog.com but I will definitely buy this once I get my economy together, and I hope you guys will too. Games like this dont grow on trees."
,sp4rk13,2012-09-14T16:46Z,works here
,surmim,2012-09-14T16:47Z,"So, any confirmation if real/fake?"
,Em3rgency,2012-09-14T16:52Z,"Just completed my first sector, definitely working fine ;)"
,simongous,2012-09-14T16:52Z,Why is this smaller than the other? :/
,Em3rgency,2012-09-14T16:54Z,"The other one has extras in it, this one is just the setup file. Thats all I could get while the other one was not seeding, sorry :/"
,hugeboss,2012-09-14T16:59Z,This game works dam good like a bozz Gonna buy this shit instead
,thxforthehelp2,2012-09-14T17:30Z,This .exe looked sketchy as fuck but none the less tried and TRUE its CLEAR and fine thank you for the good upload Em3rgency and hope for many more! Just to reiterate once more this is a CLEAN .exe have fun going FTL!
,Em3rgency,2012-09-14T19:08Z,@thxforthehelp2 Warms my heart to hear you say that :)
,MrTTAO,2012-09-14T20:42Z,"I agree the EXE looked sketchy at first...
I assumed its a good old game but it turns out its a brand new game released Sep 14th 2012.

http://www.ftlgame.com/
This exe is the version you get when you buy direct from the developer rather then from GOG. (they released on GOG, steam, and a direct sale version).

The direct sale version (this one) comes with no DRM and is steam redeemable (which means you get a license key for steam so you can redownload it there and they end up paying steam money for the privilege AND you end up with DRM added by steam itself).

Interestingly the version number on this is larger then the one on the gog version."
,S3011,2012-09-14T21:19Z,"The game crashes immediately for me. I get this in the crash log:

Version =  1.01

,alamar242344,2012-09-14T21:56Z,"Look not gonna give a hard time to anyone for pirating this as I've pirated prob over 10,000 games in my life. BUT. This game is AWESOME. And it's just a 2 man team, and there first release. And they've released it DRM free.   If you like it , *please* support these guys so they can make more games.         I rather have this one game than Call of Duty 1-12 or all the other idea-less big-budget horse shit that comes out."
,Flinn00,2012-09-14T22:31Z,"Honestly, this would have been a must-buy for me.  However, I played the demo of it on OnLive when they had that up, and I thought it was just godawful.

I'm so desperate for a game, though, that I want to try this out again.  If it turns out to not be shit, like I initially thought it was, then I'll buy it."
,Flinn00,2012-09-14T22:43Z,"Okay, it's good enough.  I just bought it."
,Lalzar,2012-09-14T23:28Z,This game has NO resolution options making it effectively impossible to play it on small monitors because fullscreen won't work and the window stretches out of the sides of my screen
,leftpirateboat,2012-09-14T23:46Z,"what changed your mind flinn? the game is ok, if they had portraits and maybe a story and inventory for every crew member it would be better, at it's current state considering that they also got some money from kicks the game is worth 5$ , i'll wait for more updates before buying it."
,black.hat,2012-09-14T23:47Z,"because this torrent is exactly the same as the one uploaded by Jc00ls0x, i was able to download the one file and seed it to both his torrent and this one
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7636623/FTL__Faster_Than_Light_DRM-Free_%28Windows%29"
,Flinn00,2012-09-15T09:34Z,"leftpirateboat, I like the different ship options a lot.  I like the different races a lot.  I like the randomized encounters a lot.  I like that it's a rogue-like.

I dunno.  It's just really scratching my itch.  I've been playing it nonstop, and have had some pretty awesome adventures so far."
,DudeJr,2012-09-15T16:52Z,I bet TB can be thanked for like half of the leeches :D
,DudeJr,2012-09-15T19:29Z,"Works, seeding :D"
,teoiric,2012-09-16T02:07Z,"how do i play it? when i download it, it comes up with a .01 file that i cant do anything with. i would buy it but im not going to risk wasting my money on a game im not sure if i like or not"
,teoiric,2012-09-16T02:15Z,"when i download it, i dont get an EXE file, i get .""01 file"" and i dont know what to do. can someone help me?"
,GoggaIor,2012-09-16T09:56Z,@teoric turn off hide file extensions and/or rename it and remove the period in 1.01
,GoggaIor,2012-09-16T09:57Z,"@Em3rgency thanks for the upload, works great and I'm having a blast. Gonna buy this one. :)"
,Manveer,2012-09-16T21:07Z,"This game is worth it guys. Its $9 on the dev site, its really fun. If you enjoy it, go buy it."
,noremakk,2012-09-16T21:56Z,"Thanks so much for this! I've been so excited for this one to come out but I can't afford it right now. If it's good, guess it's number-one thing on the next paycheck."
,sabbelquatsch,2012-09-17T18:22Z,"downloaded this in 5 minutes and played it for an hour. quickly realized i would have to buy this gem immediately
"
,BakaNe_,2012-09-18T03:39Z,"I'm having trouble with this.
I'll run the .exe and it opens. It's just the black screen with the loading bar, but once the loading bar fills, the game crashes. What do I do?"
,Em3rgency,2012-09-18T15:41Z,@BakaNe_ Nobody else seems to be having such problems. Does your computer meet the system requirements? The game is pretty much sprites only but maybe your GPU is unsupported or something. Try running as administrator.
,Ryanaft,2012-09-19T01:21Z,I downloaded this but there was no .exe anyone know how to fix this?
,insertbrainhere,2012-09-20T18:56Z,"I get the error ""the application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002)"" when trying to run. Any solutions?"
,pyro12345,2012-09-21T05:18Z,"i logged in just to type this...
downloaded it over a week ago...been playing non-stop since! for those that don't know yet, if the original zelda on NES had sex with space invaders or asteroids on ATARI, this would have been the futuristic space baby it pooped out!
its a great game and i look forward to future updates/releases from the developers"
,chris.strain,2012-09-24T14:50Z,Games installs and works great. After a day or so of playing I went and bought a copy just to support the devs. Totally worth the paltry $9 they ask for it.
,ZankmanJack,2012-09-26T04:28Z,"Wait... This game is 9 DOLLARS? Wow.
I wish I could buy it. :/ 

If you dudes can buy it, do the right thing, and buy it. :/"
,HappySmiles,2012-09-28T21:43Z,"I have the same problems as teoiric, I turned off hide file extensions and took the period out of 1.01, but I don't know how to run the file. Please help?"
,yagobraz,2012-09-29T01:45Z,We need the new FTL v. 1.02.5
,oorenotsoo,2012-09-30T06:46Z,Easy install. Works great. Fun game. Thanks for sharing.
,Igknight,2012-09-30T07:46Z,"There are no resolution options so about 1/4 of the screen falls off my monitor...is there a fix for this? This isn't what the actual game is like, right? I do want to purchase this at some point, but honestly its impossible to play for me."
,AWESUMNESS,2012-09-30T19:31Z,Awesome game gonna seed awhile...enjoy!!!
,AWESUMNESS,2012-09-30T19:32Z,Its so simple to install. even a caveman could do it!
,side.dish,2012-10-01T07:19Z,"Lol @ devs & co. with their fake comments
@ZankmanJack @Manveer @chris.strain @ForeignMustache @markofbear
I don't give a fuck if they're indie or not, those greedy assholes got 20 times what they asked for in Kickstarter for this lousy piece of shit and they still want more. I would have bought it if the extra money had gone to charity instead of their fat chink pockets."
,Kenji99,2012-10-03T15:38Z,"I agree with side.dish nothing is worse than devs that use fake ratings and reviews, they must think we are all morons if they think we believe they are real. NO ONE THINKS THEY ARE REAL! The only effect it has is to make people hate your company!"
,Em3rgency,2012-10-03T23:22Z,Well the game is great and it really IS cheap. Does not matter how much money the devs already got. Someone who can make a game like this could make more great titles. I haven't bought it because I've spent all I had on humble indie bundle 6 :/
