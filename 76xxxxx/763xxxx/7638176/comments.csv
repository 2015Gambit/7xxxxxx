[V],twentyforty,2012-09-15T19:16Z,"@hunck: I cannot guarantee if you have same encodes or not (from weekly uploads before) but you can load this torrent and check for individual file-sizes. However, if you have THIS season pack from SU - it's the same one."
,sree10,2012-09-16T07:10Z,How's the video??? Please give ur reviews and ratings....Thanks
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-16T07:58Z,"@019815: Iceman DVD, as any other mivie from 1970-1990 period (except literally handfull) is so ugly that is almost untouchable. Point being that I have it in the archive, but because is so ugly, I haven't released it. Ripping shitty DVD gives ugly encode - and that's a fact. If movie is good, I would risk getting same rubbish as you can see following  next answer.

@sree10: Frankly and honestly - stay away. I mean it.
