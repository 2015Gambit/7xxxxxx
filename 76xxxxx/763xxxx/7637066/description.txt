Archaeologist Julius Gabriel devoted his life to studying the Mayan calendar, a 2500-year-old enigma that predicts the end of humanity. But when Julius dies before solving the prophecy, only one person can save the human race from annihilation: JuliusΓÇÖs son Mick, a patient in a mental hospital.

Meanwhile, on the fall equinox, a serpent's shadow appears on the northern balustrade of the Kukulcan Pyramid, just as it has done for a thousand years. But this time, a rare galactic alignment occurs, and a space transmission reaches Earth.

It is the beginning of the end . . .
