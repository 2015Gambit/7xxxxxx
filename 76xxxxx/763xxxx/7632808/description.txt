Skype lets you make Internet-based VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) phone calls for free to anyone in the world who also uses Skype on their PC, and make inexpensive calls from your PC to landlines and cell phones worldwide. Skype uses P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to connect you to other users ΓÇô not to share files this time, but to talk and chat with your friends. The technology is extremely advanced ΓÇô but super simple to useΓÇª YouΓÇÖll be making free phone calls to your friends in no time! ItΓÇÖs also an instant messenger as well, because has integrated chat. Skype is the simplest way to save money on your phone bill. Skype does more than phone calls. It also lets you video chat and text chat as well, and send SMS messages. The newest version of Skype also features nifty integration with Firefox ΓÇô you can call any phone number you see on a Web site with one click. Skype will automatically recognize your headset, microphone, and speakers, so you donΓÇÖt need to worry about configuration.

To call another Skype user, enter a user name, and youΓÇÖre ready to go. You can also save a list of users, so calling them back is simple. To call landlines and cell phones, youΓÇÖll need to set up an account and buy credit. Then, whenever you make a call, that credit is used. Calling other people on Skype is free so you can talk whenever you want to ΓÇô not just on special occasions. Call to check in with mum when youΓÇÖre travelling, give your partner a goodnight kiss via video call when theyΓÇÖre away on business, or use it for your regular calls and catch ups. And, if you know people who donΓÇÖt use Skype you can call them too at really low rates.
