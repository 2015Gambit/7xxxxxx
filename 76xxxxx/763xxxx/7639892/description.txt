Hot on the heels of the first United State of Ambience compilation came this follow-up, subtitled "id-Atlantic Sessions." Just as hinted on the cover, the album serves up a nice blend of European and American ambient music. Dreamy, ethereal, and fluid, the music tends to lull you into a semi spaced-out state if you let it. You can also choose to tune it out -- mostly or completely, as you wish. There really isn't a single part of the album that jumps out and grabs you, though there are plenty of moments of quiet beauty. The first track, which was among the first released by ambient pioneers Electric Skychurch, is outstanding. Vocalist Judith Ann Warren adds a wistful, angelic presence to the free-form instrumental soundscape. Some of the later tracks can't compare; without vocals or a discernible melody, they fail to capture your attention. However, two tracks are immediately familiar: Orbital's "Attached" and the song "My Friend" by the British live electronica act One Dove. As always, Moonshine attempts to push the envelope and explore new realms in electronic music; the results are interesting if not always enthralling. The label also got a good mixture of electronica stars -- emerging acts such as Salt Tank and relatively obscure artists such as Synthetix and Somnambulist.
