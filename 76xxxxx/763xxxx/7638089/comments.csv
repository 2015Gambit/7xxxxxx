,mracefiji,2012-09-15T11:43Z,it seems its fake
,plex117,2012-09-15T12:49Z,real?
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-15T14:05Z,Of course it's real lol!
,JeffCC,2012-09-15T14:06Z,"no, its fuck FAKE lol!!! Screenshot is dead"
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-15T14:31Z,Screens are working...
,KingNico,2012-09-15T15:03Z,the screens are NOT working
,TheMadBro,2012-09-15T15:27Z,The screenshots sadly aren't working. But these morons don't seem to understand that just because the screenshot links are having issues the torrent doesn't have to be fake. It could just be a hosting issue where the images are.
,plex117,2012-09-15T15:33Z,i need a real answer!!!
,piranical,2012-09-15T15:53Z,"Horrorspoke is a green skull and he's confirmed it's real...it's real. can't get the screens either, dling and will update on quality comparisons with The Dark Knight Rises 2012 ANOTHER NEW SOURCE TS XViD - INSPiRAL, which had been the best up until this point. we'll see."
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-15T16:02Z,"Hmmm, they're working for me?!? Here are some alternatives!

,piranical,2012-09-15T16:46Z,"still dlding whole movie but, from viewing sample, this is most definitely the best copy of tdkr to date. for cam - v8.5, a8.5... thanks Horrorspoke & UNiQUE."
,jonnycinq,2012-09-15T17:35Z,"Best copy so far, but it appears to be in 24fps which means when theres movement it looks bad. I would wait for better."
,novfilms,2012-09-15T19:03Z,its easily the best so far. chinese hard coded graphic appears every once in a while at top almost like an academy screener but excellent comparatively. i agree what was said about the 24fps movement comment but still VERY enjoyable and there certainly won't be a screener for still quite a while. and it's in sync!
,DownloadSafe,2012-09-16T06:10Z,This has nothing to do with the actual download... But why does the movie poster say Milla Jovovich??? Shouldn't it be Marion Cotillard...
,jankula,2012-09-16T12:48Z,"Thanks A Lot Horrorspoke!

,tflagger997,2012-09-18T01:42Z,"This is NOT HD.  This is a cam.  It may be a good cam, but the recording quality if far below HD levels.  So far you have posted three versions of the same thing, claiming they are all HD.  

Since you are one of the few green skullers that actually seem to respond -

What is in this for you?  If you are making $ then I understand, but if not then it makes no sense.

At least you are not NLUPPER002 stretching the hell out of them and calling it 720p.

I do appreciate the effort, do not get me wrong.  It is the spam and the misleading titles which waste my bandwidth and time, which makes me mistrust most people with green skulls anymore.  SceneBalance, TvTeam, S4A, and the other groups are far worse, but they do not even bother to read their comments so I only try to warn people when they start with their crap."
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-18T08:26Z,"@tflagger997...

I very rarely have time to do my own encoding any more, so I tend to post 'scene' releases now. I didn't make the title up, this was the name given to the release before I uploaded it. Changing the title makes it difficult to search for a particular version, therefore I don't change them (or at least very rarely, normally on the odd occasion when something doesn't do what it says on the tin).

Everyone's opinions are different, and I have seen little to make me believe that that this ISN'T a HDTS, and has been posted with it's original title.

And no, nothing is made from it, it's a rebellious hobby."
,Aaront21,2012-09-27T18:23Z,"This release has the best audio of any source so far, it's a shame that video is so blurry :(

,wertyuiop9999,2012-09-28T02:05Z,Thx for UL! good quality for a TS.
