Windows 7 is the most-recent major release of the Microsoft Windows operating system, and is available in six different editions (Home Premium, Enterprise, Ultimate, Professional, Starter, and Home Basic). Only Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate are widely available at retailers.[1] The other editions focus on other markets, such as the developing world or enterprise use. All editions support IA-32 CPUs and all editions except Starter support the x64 CPUs. (64-bit installation media are not included in Home Basic edition packages, but can be obtained from Microsoft).
According to Microsoft, the features for all editions of Windows 7 are stored on the machine, regardless of which edition is in use.[2] Users who wish to upgrade to an edition of Windows 7 with more features can then use Windows Anytime Upgrade to purchase the upgrade and to unlock the features of those editions.[1][2][3] Microsoft announced Windows 7 pricing information for some editions on June 25, 2009, and Windows Anytime Upgrade and Family Pack pricing on July 31, 2009
