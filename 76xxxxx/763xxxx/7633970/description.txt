This is a pre modded world at war iso file, meaning all you have to do is burn it to a disk. 

If you wish to watch and see what these mods look like, go to my youtube channel "ISOSICKLEoCOM". 

This iso is pre patched, so no real need to run through abgx360, but it's always good to anyways. 

Thanks guys! If you want me to keep uploading the new patches I get, make sure to seed and comment down below. Helps me a ton. 

Thanks!!!
