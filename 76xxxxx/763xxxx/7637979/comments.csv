From the comments I notice that several people have been having issues with Viveza. Here's a simple fix to ensure it works correctly: After install and replacing the relevant *.dll files, when launched for the first time Viveza automatically tries to update itself by accessing the internet. I recommend people use a firewall to deny its access or simply disconnect your internet connection when you launch it for the first time. Once open, go to the Viveza plugin settings and change the software update settings to ""Never."" It will no longer try to update itself and you're free to run the plugin as you wish without any further issues."
