Information
------------------------------

Journey into lush jungle foliage, up fog-bathed mountains, under flaming desert sands, back in time. How would it feel to be the first one, to be a bold explorer, to make a one-of-a-kind discovery? Return to the golden age of exploration as five men set out into the world to make their names. This exciting five-episode Discovery Channel series will take you to South Africa, the Gobi Desert, the Andes Mountains, Egypt's Valley of the Kings, and the islands of Crete and Santorini to discover the missing link in human evolution, the bones of new dinosaur species, the lost city of the Inca, the undisturbed tomb of King Tutankhamun, and the lost civilization of the Minoans.



3)  Dragon Hunters - Secrets of the Gobi Desert 
Roy Andrews was an adventurer. Protege to the head of New York's Museum of Natural History, Andrews sets out to prove his patron's theory that mammals had first developed on the continent of Asia. Backed by the exploration-mad financial giants who head up New York society, Andrews outfits the first automotive expedition to the burning sands of Mongolia's Gobi Desert. There he battles the inhospitable climate, the machinations of the local government and the ever-present threat of violent bandits and marauding warlords. In a quest that would cost him his eyesight, his happy marriage and, very nearly his life, The Dragon Hunter's discoveries add immeasurably to mankind's knowledge of evolution.
