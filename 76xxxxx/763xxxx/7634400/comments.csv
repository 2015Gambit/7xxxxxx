Screens are 1 280px Ă&#x2014; 546px."
,drexel75,2012-09-14T22:22Z,@tedevil   idk why evbody always says the same thing on yifi torrents. Generally all his torrents have excellent video for their size. alot of times better video than the 5 gb torrents. the only thing about yifi torrents is the audio isnt quite perfect. 
,Kole97,2012-09-15T08:46Z,Thanks Yify!

Cheers"
