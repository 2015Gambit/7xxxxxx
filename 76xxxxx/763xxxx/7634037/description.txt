For fixed-gear cyclists, Los Angeles is a city that has it all. From the neon glow of Hollywood to the sun-drenched boardwalk of Venice Beach, fixed-gear has evolved into a vibrant street culture that is uniquely L.A. From director David Rowe ("Fast Friday") comes a new documentary feature that explores a side of L.A. few outsiders have seen. From races through rush-hour traffic to midnight loft parties, TO LIVE & RIDE IN L.A. is a fast paced-trip through the busy streets and back-alleys of one of the world's largest cities. TO LIVE & RIDE IN L.A. features talented local riders tearing up the streets with first-time visitor Keo Curry ("Fast Friday", "Macaframa") - one of the living legends of the sport. Bike to hidden spots off the map, race a midnight alley-cat, keep pace with the riders from Wolfpack, and hang with the local crews, graffiti artists and other L.A. personalities burning up the fixed-gear scene.
