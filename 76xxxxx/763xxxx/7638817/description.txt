 Yakov Perelman - Astronomy for Entertainment. 

From  the Preface:

    The purpose of the book is to initiate the reader into the basic facts of astronomy. But do not take it as a primer, since our presentation differs essentially from any text-book. Ordinary facts with which you may be acquainted are couched here in unexpected paradoxes, or slanted from an odd and unexpected angle, solely with a view to excite imagination and quicken interest. We have tried to free the theme as far as possible from the professional "terminology" and technical paraphernalia that so often make the reader shy of books on astronomy.

    ...

    The book contains chapters relating to the Earth, the Moon, planets,
    stars and gravitation. The author has concentrated in the main on
    materials not usually discussed in works of this nature. Subjects
    omitted in the present book, will, he hopes, be treated in a second volume. The book, it should be said, makes no attempt to analyze in detail the rich content of modern astronomy.

The book was translated from the Russian by A. Shkarovsky and edited by J. Gibbons and was published by Foreign Languages Publishing House in 1958. I do not know of any other editions.
