,jimbus80,2012-09-16T21:22Z,"Isn't this antivirus too heavy for the computer? I mean, will it slow down the computer considerably?"
[T],chuckie6,2012-09-16T21:24Z,"From other comments it appears I have a one off problem. Am unable to run the 0BETA5 app that was unrar'd, the response being a failure to initialise  with an error 0xc0000135. According to the text help file this app should be 0BETA4, does this make a difference. Little experience with pc's as I'm a Mac user! any help appreciated.

Thanks to GhOstNet for the upload."

,burnoutz,2012-09-25T19:32Z,"Yeah, I'm having the same problem as ad7es. I'm not at the end of my 30 day trial though; I noticed it just now at 29 days left. Only one day and I've already lost my activation. I'll try again and hope for the best."
,ezra4,2012-09-25T19:33Z,thank you so much. i now have bitdefender activivated for 23739 days (65 years) which i think is probably long enough.
,burnoutz,2012-09-25T19:55Z,"K, so I just activated it again for a year, except when I restarted it now says I have 2yrs (730 days). Guess it just added it to the last time I activated. Hope it works this time."
,JBiz1,2012-09-26T21:57Z,Has anyone past the 30 trial date and its still activated? I noticed on my bitdefender account it says 30 Days (Trial) and on the program it says 3652 days left.  So after the 30 days on the site will it change it in the program?? Anyone past the 30 day trial can you verify that it stays active?  Thanks!
,JBiz1,2012-09-27T17:58Z,Bitdefender TS is overkill!!!!! Going back to Kasper..
,johnny-27,2012-09-28T12:56Z,I dont see how this could work. you have to activate your product with a licence key online at MyBitdefender. BD connects with your account each time you update - in fact each time you are online - and compares the dates. its useless to activate the program without confirming it in your account. any objections?
,benjur,2012-10-03T16:26Z,"I'm having issues, i followed your instructions, but when i'm in safe mode, it doesn't allow me to click activate. Am i missing a step? Any help is greatly appreciated."
,vargth,2012-10-03T23:48Z,@ benjur you first have to verify your email with bitdefender.If you notice while you re in safe mode and open the activator there are some red letters at the bottom of it saying that you have to be logged in.Right?Just verify it and retry.Hope this helps
