This shorts are in original version with Spanish subtitles, this is the first of who know how many DVDs from a collection apparently, got it from my scientific thinking teacher for the rest of the class who couldn't assist or didn't know about the projection that was being held some hours before the class started.

Contents:
1- "El gran éxtasis the escultor de madera Steiner"
2- "Los mèdicos voladores de Àfrica oriental" <<<<<<<<<<<
3- "Futuro limitado"

The second was the projected one, it talks about what happened in Africa with the Masai, a tribe from oriental Africa, and the doctors that had to fly their way to the villages because it was inaccessible by any other mean and also explains the natives' behaviours toward thing that were from cultures so apart from theirs.
Interesting to anyone studying psychology or just wanting to know more from other cultures.


This is the ISO (.iso file) image of the DVD, it's 4,4GB (exactly one DVD5).
To watch either burn it to an empty DVD or open the image file with VLC and it should play as if you were playing it from the DVD.
