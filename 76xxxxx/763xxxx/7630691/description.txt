In the bleak and ominous future of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1, itΓÇÖs been a decade since Bruce Wayne hung up his cape, following most of the other superheroes who had been forced into retirement. Facing the downside of middle age, a restless Bruce Wayne pacifies his frustration with racecars and liquor ΓÇô but the Bat still beckons as he watches his city fall prey to gangs of barbaric criminals known as The Mutants.The return of Harvey Dent as Two-Face finally prompts Wayne to once again don the Dark KnightΓÇÖs cowl, and his dramatic capture of the villain returns him to crime-fighting ΓÇô simultaneously making him the target of law enforcement and the new hope for a desolate Gotham City. Particularly inspired is a teenage girl named Carrie, who adopts the persona of Robin and ultimately saves Batman from a brutal attack by the Mutant leader. Armed with a new sidekick, and re-energized with a definitive purpose, the Dark Knight returns to protect Gotham from foes newΓÇª and old.Based on the Graphic Novel BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS by Frank Miller and Klaus Janson
