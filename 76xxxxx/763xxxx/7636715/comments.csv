Moone Boy, which will be set in 80s Ireland, takes its cue from Chris O'Dowd's episode of Little Crackers, which told the story of a young boy and his imaginary friend.

The new show will explore the life and adventures of Martin Moone and invisible buddy Sean, using Martin's chaotic, scatter-brained family life as a backdrop.
