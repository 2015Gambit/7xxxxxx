# Installation Instructions:

  1- Extract the file using winzip or winrar.
  
  2- Install "ASRSetup.exe" fully but [[DO NOT LAUNCH IT]].
  
  3- Move/Copy "asr-exe-patch.exe" to the application's folder which in my case using was Windows 7 64bit
				[C:Program Files (x86)Actual Search & Replace].
				
  4- Open the patch and click "Crack" and make sure that in the crack status it says "successfully cracked" in green then close it.
  
  5- Go back to the extracted folder and open the keygen and type the name that you want to be registered for then click on "GENERATE" then "COPY CODE".
  
  6- Open "Actual Search & Replace" and it will ask you if you want to run the application in demo mode or you want to register it ...
	 click on register and paste the copied code.
	 
  7- Well Done ... you're now fully activated ;)
