,ghostb25,2012-09-15T09:39Z,what about the show first?? can't find it....
,AtomicPizza,2012-09-15T09:44Z,mush! mush!
,xenoFLASH,2012-09-15T10:03Z,It's a shame that Overtime comes out before the actual show.
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T10:09Z,"ghostb25:

They are slow, I am fast.

I don't see how this is my fault ... ;)

Will get the video drug to the addicts just as soon as the shipment arrives ..."
,JarjarTwink,2012-09-15T10:16Z,VTV usually upploads it around 1pm swedish time...
,JarjarTwink,2012-09-15T10:17Z,"@mp4sux

thx for this upload anyhow. =)"
,UTF1127,2012-09-15T10:21Z,"I'm assuming this is up before the actual show because it's much shorter. We all know you're doing your best, we really appreciate it! "
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T10:34Z,"The truth is that I gat the OT direct from the HBO web site and then work my magic.

Unfortunately, we're all in the hands of those arrogant few at ""The Scene"" who've really been falling down on the job of late.

Calling P2P or any independent - we need some competition here."
,eeuropean2000,2012-09-15T11:27Z,"Thanks, dude.  I know it's easier to prep a 10-minute thing than an hour long thing & am prepared to wait. Also, mega props for your nick.  Damn MP4 files! :)"
[V],TheExecutive,2012-09-15T11:36Z,Mp4 doesn't suck -- it RULES ! 
,BoonesFerry,2012-09-15T12:28Z,"Thanks for doing the Overtime segments...
but is it really necessary for you to insult ""the scene"" in the process. Afterall, ""the scene"" has brought us all of hudreds-of-thousands of movies, tv shows, apps, etc. for a very long time. There is a lot be grateful for. It's also very nice of you to provide xvid/avi files for those who's antiquated setups dont allow them to play the current and far superior x264/mp4/mkv files. "
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T12:48Z,"Yes, it's necessary ...

Monopolies are bad ... VERY BAD ..."
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T20:45Z,"Now I've gone to sleep and it's now the next day and ""The Scene"" is nowhere to be seen ...

With seven billion people, shouldn't there be at least dozens capping popular shows? Maybe everyone at ""The Scene"" just decided to go on vacation yesterday - but it looks like the community's built in oligopoly is throwing a huge snit because nobody chooses MP4 unless commanded to be edict. Not movies, not DVDrips, nothing - it's MKV or its AVI. 5% voluntary MP4 at most

The new heros of the scene (pun intended) are due to arrive any day now ..."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-15T22:08Z,Can you please upload Doctor Who S07E03 A Town Called Mercy in avi/xvid around 350MB-480MB with audio @128kbps? :D
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T23:00Z,"BUTT_SEX:

The x264 CC2AVI is up now - the XVID version is coming in a very short while.

Sorry, I've settled on audio @ 160KB/s my tradeoff between quality and file size.

Enjoy ..."
,AlfaRomeo2012,2012-09-16T01:40Z,"Thanks for Overtime in AVI!

Many times I find the 'Real Time with Bill Maher' show does not get uploaded promptly.  Someone was speculating the person assigned to cap this show might be a right winger who hates his assignment and so is not too enthused about uploading it promptly."
,Lonsman,2012-09-16T07:51Z,Sad state of affairs not being able to get this in decent quality...Used to be multiple uploaders
