The general concept of Mizuumi ryu, my formulation of karate, is to train the whole body as one holistic unit - and to train not only the body, but the mind and spirit as well. The ideal of the Mizuumi ryu style is to dedicate oneself every day to become the best possible in every situation ΓÇô not only in martial arts training, but also in every area of life.
