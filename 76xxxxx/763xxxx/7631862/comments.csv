THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU HAD A KEYGEN FOR THIS RATHER THAN JUST 1 CODE FOR EVERYONE . THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA FAIL QUITE QUICKLY ."
,sollefou,2012-09-20T15:14Z,"I found how to get a keygen for this one

1 - get and install trend micro security 2010 (available in TPB) with keygen
2 - wwhen installed, Trend will tell you that thiss version is too old (or something to the effect, BUT that you can use you key for the 2013 version, availabble from their site (there's a link on the window that says so)
3-install trend 2013 and use your trend 2010 keygen-generated key (that's a mouthful!), and voilĂ  !"
