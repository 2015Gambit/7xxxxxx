Another one of those prehistoric recordings, listening to which I
sometimes wonder, how they managed to get all the coal up the rock,
where the festival took place. Because, as you may know, in those 
days the portable recording units, then euphemistically called 
"Walkman", were still steam engine driven. That you will certainly 
fancy yourselves from the rather poor sound quality of this recording.
However, there don't seem to exist so many copies at all, hence I 
dare to publish mine. But the music will pay back your loss at any 
rate.

Technically, the recording consists of four parts, corresponding 
to the two Maxell XL-II C90 tapes I ripped them from. The parts are
overlapping, thus you can sew them together quite easily. No noise
reduction or any processing have been applied to the playback on 
my side, the data you get are as retrieved from the tapes.
(Unfortunately they comprise in the first 15 or so minutes the 
ignorant babble of that Lady on the left channel. If I had attended 
the concert myself back then, I certainly would have stuffed her 
mouth or dropped her off the cliff. Never liked that brat anyway.)
