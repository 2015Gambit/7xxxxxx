Mighty Fearsome was formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the summer of 2012. The group began with the songwriting goal of emulating the fusion of pop and jazz sensibilities found on such records as the Beatles' Rubber Soul. All six members knew each other in college and made music together in various ways. Mighty Fearsome's music features memorable melodies and intricate vocal harmonies, supported by minimalist instrumental accompaniment.
