Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy
In the past several years documentary filmmaker Gary Hustwit has made a trio of fascinating movies about design: Helvetica, Objectified and Urbanized. Taken as a whole they explore design in an elaborate fashion, ranging from the small (with Helvetica discussing graphic design and its tiniest details in typography) to the very large (cities and city planning in Urbanized). Hustwit is at his best when emphasizing the small details.-from the pixel of Helvetica's computer screens to the chairs and cars of Objectified to the roads and buildings of Urbanized-not a single detail will be missed. Every piece of our world, from smallest to biggest, is accounted for and explored for the vast amounts of thought, creativity, and pain that goes into its realization.



3)  Urbanized 
The third documentary in this trilogy is about the design of cities. Urbanized looks at the issues and strategies behind urban design, featuring some of the world's foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers. Over half the world's population now lives in an urban area, and 75% will call a city home by 2050. But while some cities are experiencing explosive growth, others are shrinking. The challenges of balancing housing, mobility, public space, civic engagement, economic development, and environmental policy are fast becoming universal concerns. Yet much of the dialogue on these issues is disconnected from the public domain.
