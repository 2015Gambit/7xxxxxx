,c_moore47102,2012-09-15T15:49Z,This is the real deal! I couldn't believe that this movie was on iTunes and yet I couldn't find it at all on thepiratebay! So I put a stop to that and now everyone can enjoy this spectacular video!
,botibol,2012-09-16T01:40Z,I can't leech. It shows 0 seeders on my transmission client. Am I doing something wrong.
,botibol,2012-09-16T01:41Z,more exactly it shows 1119 oeers but noone is giving me anything. Is it cause is new? I want to know :)
,chuckasarus,2012-09-16T16:35Z,"No one has been seeding this torrent, hmmm?"
,MSmith515,2012-09-17T07:03Z,"Ya, i was pretty excited to see it finally uploaded but only showing 4 seeds none of which i can connect to.  Please seed people!"
,MSmith515,2012-09-18T00:19Z,sigh.... let it sit all day at work.  Get home to see 0bytes downloaded.  Don't bother.  Can't connect to any of the seeds and no one can finish the dl and seed.  Someone needs to reupload this. 
,MSmith515,2012-09-20T22:09Z,C_moore has forsaken us.  If u upload a torrent u gotta seed. 
,angelpunem,2012-09-22T22:03Z,"c-moore you're a tool, i've been waiting 2 weeks for you to get your act together.....what's the point of saying you uploaded something , when u havn't !!!!!!!! ?????"
,c_moore47102,2012-09-23T20:58Z,"Sorry guys, if I had unlimited bandwidth, I'd gladly seed for you all, but unfortunately usage is a bit tight this month."
,chuckasarus,2012-09-27T03:10Z,4 days now and no seeds. This torrent sucks!
