Details:

The source for this remaster is a superb stereo recording,
taped from a NDR2 (Germany) FM rebroadcast of the concert in
Venezia. Dozens of hours were spent, in order to manually
clean every little FM noise (crackles, slight buzz,...) and
make this remaster as close as possible to the quality of
an official release.

It has to be noted that the NDR2 FM rebroadcast cut the
second half of Wish You Were Here. The missing portion
was patched from a TV broadcast source. The intro and
outro (fireworks) of the show were also taken from the TV
broadcast, in order to make this recording more complete
(the FM source ended rather abruptly after the last chord
of Run Like Hell).

This stereo remaster was used for the audio part of the
"Live In Venezia" DVD from Cochon Production.

Enjoy!
