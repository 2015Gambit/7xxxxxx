"This is an excellent sounding recording of a very good show.  The cymbals are very crisp in the mix, and everybody is as where they should be, right to left...Donna's voice actually hits the mark.  If you are a fan of good sounding recordings or of the Spring '78 shows, this is a must have.  Awesome 'Deal' !
