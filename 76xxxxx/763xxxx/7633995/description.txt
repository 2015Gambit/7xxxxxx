"Hank Speech"

Steve has to take on Hank as a client after one 
of Hank's coworkers (guest star Will Sasso) 
files an HR complaint against him for making 
'inappropriate comments,' but the gang is 
hesitant to rally behind him. Meanwhile, Susan 
and her mother bond and spend time together 
after Susan provides her mother with a fake ID 
granting her senior citizen status.
