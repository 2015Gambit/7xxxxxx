I have iPad 2 iOS 5.1.1 with JB and downloaded JeppFD from the AppStore.

I copied the files to the required place and I can see all airports in the list. However I get the following error when I select any airport: 'The requested chart is not in the library. Contact Jeppesen Technical Support'.

I get this error when I install any older cycle, not just VFR but full world. Enroute charts are working but I get the same error for any terminal chart. 

I tried to reinstall and set back the iPad clock to the past without success :( any idea? thanks!"
