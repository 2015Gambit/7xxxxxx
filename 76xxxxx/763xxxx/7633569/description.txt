This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from a lossless FLAC source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:
It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Primus's latest. Great conversion, but sat on my HD for a few months because I thought no one gave a rat's ass about Primus in 2012. They're reissuing "Sailing the Seas of Cheese" in 5.1 and are touring in quad so, clearly, I was wrong.
