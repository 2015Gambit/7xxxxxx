,fauzan18,2012-09-16T11:16Z,"Its not a CFW its most likely an official firmware.If you want to use custom firmware then you have to be on 3.55 firmware,and the latest DEX firmware is 4.21.There isn't any 4.25 custom firmware for the ps3 of any kind as of this moment.So if any of you download the torrent and run it on your ps3 then you will end on 4.25 official firmware.

,Greek123,2012-09-17T13:43Z,"but on ps3jail.com says that it works on firmware 
v4.25"
,fauzan18,2012-09-17T16:08Z,"@Greek123
If it indeed is a custom firmware and you have installed it on your ps3 then please tell us if you can run backups on your ps3 or not or if you can run multiman on your ps3 or not. "
