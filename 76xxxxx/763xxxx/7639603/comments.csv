,room237,2012-09-15T21:27Z,And speaking for those of us more appreciative types...thank you leechers whatever/wherever basement you are in currently...as I have plenty of time to wait...incarcerated in this slow moving vehicle called life. 
,Th3.4nsw3r,2012-09-15T21:47Z,"@ room237:  You must be new here. The first dozen torrents are usually fake, requiring purchases or registration to various illegitimate websites just to catch a glimpse of the movie.

There's a good possibility this is one of those...I wouldn't swear to it, but the chance is always there...besides, this number of seeders for something that has only been up less than half an hour? Right, okay.

Some movement and screen distortion but it works"
,tflagger997,2012-09-16T01:16Z,"Ya, Th3.4nsw3r stop being stupid like simon200.  

We all know that Green Skulls mean nothing since they just duplicate each others work in an endless circle-jerk.  TvTeam was the first on this one, and the time index means scenebalance & Hacklus cannot be blamed (this time), but usually there are hours or even days between their dups.  Check out The Dark Knight to see a prime example of Spam from these same Green Skullers.

Of course, we also see that the quality of this movie is crap even for a cam.  How can that be?  Well you see, most Green Skullers are teams who do not actually watch/check what they upload.  They grab it from another site and upload it here.  That is how they can post crap, or even upload the wrong thing (TvTeam has done this with TV shows, as have most here).

So come back and thank them if they are the first, AND if it was worth the time to download.  Never thank before you check it out though.  They do deserve our thanks, but not for automatically uploading everything they come across.

Always come back and report on the A/V and make sure to use the Quality meter in the upper right corner (click on the +1 or -1).  If we start helping each other avoid the crappy Spam, then maybe they will stop posting it.  One copy of crap is enough."
,room237,2012-09-16T17:36Z,"@Th3.4nsw3r Correcting a thank you note. You atheist twats sure do have a god complex. @nauskas is probably close A=4 V=5 shaky, but all in all an ok copy. And definitely real, so you are wrong. (More than likely not the first/last time) And you are wrong about your theory regarding the first dozen torrents as well. So suck on my noob you boob!"
