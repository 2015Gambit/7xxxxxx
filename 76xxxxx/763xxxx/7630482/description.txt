A different Angel Aquino ΓÇô We are used to see her in ΓÇ£Us GirlsΓÇ¥ us a host, then we all witness her acting prowess on ABS-CBN teleseryes ΓÇ£MagkaribalΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Maria la del BarrioΓÇ¥ but this time we will see how will she be able to horrified us as she plays the role of Rosa a grieving mother. She admits that she is more comportable playing contrabida roles, so doing ΓÇ£Amorosa: The RevengeΓÇ¥ was a stretch for her creativity.
