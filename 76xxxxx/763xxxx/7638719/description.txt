I am also in possession of ~280 HQ scans of works dating from the 15th to the 19th century on the subject of alchemy and related topics (magic, mysticism and Kabbalah), which are the foundation of the Works of C.G.Jung and come from his private collection. Most of them are in Latin, a lot in German, few in French and English. Total size: 42 GB. At the time, it was one of the most complete private collections in the field of alchemy.
