This   is the  way it   looks. Do you know why this is happening? Thank you"
,citizendonny,2012-09-13T18:04Z,"When i posted , this is the way it looks, the spaces didn't show. maybe you know what i am talking about."
,TxJag,2012-09-13T18:12Z,@CitizenDonny are these ANY book(s) that you get from me or someone else who has uploaded?
,TxJag,2012-09-13T18:17Z,@CitizenDonny If you can be more specific and detailed with the problem that will help. Cause I have no idea what your talking about. Never had an issue with spacing.
,citizendonny,2012-09-13T21:58Z,"This is an example from one book that I am reading with Calibre. Kurds   and    Arabs canâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t be expected   to have       enough in      common to make a          functioning state, what          do you call a        jurisdiction split   between post-. As you can see the words have spaces between them. I am using  calibre on my computer, not a e-reader. "
,citizendonny,2012-09-13T22:00Z,"Whenever I copy this as a comment to you, all the words are ok. Don't know how to explain it further w/o giving you an example."
,citizendonny,2012-09-13T22:01Z,this problem is for all my ebooks
,TxJag,2012-09-13T22:09Z,@citizendonny I can't help. I've never had an issue with spacing. The issue MIGHT be with the book itself. It depends on how it is or was formatted to start with.
