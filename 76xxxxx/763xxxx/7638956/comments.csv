,Tanlic,2012-09-16T08:16Z,Looks like another copy of a crap copy put up in another  format. About as near to DVD quailty as a bad cam from Bangkok
,Daftmau5,2012-09-17T16:28Z,"What horse crap, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!! Look at the screens!"
,tflagger997,2012-09-18T01:32Z,"Not 720p, just another crappy cam that was stretched.  NLUPPER002 does this for all movies for some reason, bloating their size.  This is no better than a 1.6GB version, so do not bother with this kind of crap."
,moddeath,2012-09-20T20:28Z,For a HDTS it doesn't look bad. But yes it is a TS and not a DVD rip -_-
,blueskullking,2012-09-27T09:40Z,VOTE -1 for Quality up top!!! Crap
,BobbySoSlo,2012-09-29T04:49Z,"Dead NLUPPER002, what do you gain by uploading a piece of crap as a DVD Rip?  Thank you for wasting peoples time."
