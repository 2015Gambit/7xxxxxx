[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-16T17:50Z,"...Yeah Gh0stNet, you really should have put 'Chinese' in the 'Spoken Language(s)' section. You have also specified 'NO SUB' in the file info, but in the 'Texted Languages(s)' section you have specified 'English' as subtitles. There is a difference between speed of upload and quality of upload.

Please be careful when uploading files like this to ensure correct details are entered.

Not having a go, simply confirming the file type and info.....

CONF: Chinese Spoken language.
CONF: NOT SUBBED.

To confirm also, this has now been re-encoded and uploaded with English audio.

Cheers...."
