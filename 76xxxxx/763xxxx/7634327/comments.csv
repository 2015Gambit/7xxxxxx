,Evilution,2012-09-20T23:57Z,"The film was worth watching, but as mentioned before, the English translation is fucking horrible most of the time.
Looks like a full-on Google translate..."

Somebody who speaks German please, please fix and upload new subtitles. Many people would be very grateful. Ich danke Ihnen!"

Thanks aoloffline.
I agree with Chartsandgrafs and Evilution. We'll need to guess at the meaning until someone posts a proper translation.

I checked Subscene, Opensubtitles, and Podnapisi websites to no avail. The subs they have are as bad as the ones that are muxed in this file."
