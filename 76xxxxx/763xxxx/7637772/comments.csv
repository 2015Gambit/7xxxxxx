,X-Bit2011,2012-09-16T20:07Z,"@maillort:
If you donÂ´t like the avi releases, stfu and find another one which suits you best.

For me those avi releases are the best thing ever, not having access to high end equipment and streaming over WII to the television!

So, THANKS EZ for your work and dedication!"
