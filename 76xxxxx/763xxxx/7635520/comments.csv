,markofbear,2012-09-14T16:57Z,"Heya guys, as always if you like the game buy it, its a really awesome game and as most indie devs i think the more money we throw at them the better games they will make in future! Their homepage is: http://www.ftlgame.com/ and also on steam of course! :D "
,MrTTAO,2012-09-14T20:35Z,"GOG release, contains all extra content (and the manual!) as well as the setup file.
setup_ftl_1.0.0.6.exe
md5: 7c31c7d9557775441582106dafd2ac7d

The md5 matches that from the one released by CPY by a trusted uploader."
,OmniNegro,2012-09-14T23:17Z,Thank you MrTTAO. I wish more people bothered to include relevant information like hashes of the files for those of us who doubt most Torrents.
