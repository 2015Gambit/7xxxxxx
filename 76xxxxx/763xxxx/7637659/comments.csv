[V],psspss,2012-09-17T07:07Z,"I dont do HD.. only xvids.. I dont need big files
and mp4s or mkvs :) plus HD is upsetting the tv companies I think and why theyre now targeting p2p sites more. lower quality wont upset them as mp4 is what the stream and 720p is what they sell on dvds

however TNE has legendET uploading higher quality do a search.. but I dont think theres a 720p added .. although I think theres a copy floating the web.. no one has bothered adding to p2p yet"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-09-17T08:20Z,I'll check it out.I like the first season & I can't believe I missed season 2 on your page.I check it every day for your hard to find para/ufo stuff
