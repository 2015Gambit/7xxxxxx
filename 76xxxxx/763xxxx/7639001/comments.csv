,seokhun,2012-09-15T21:16Z,"Low frame rates causes the image to blur in fast sequences, but other than that, damn good quality. Almost DVD. Completely watchable, except for a watermark of a Chinese website in the corners.

Video: (10 - Blu-ray, 7 - DVD, 5 - TS, 3 - CAM)
Audio: (10 - Blu-ray, 7 - DVD, 5 - TS, 3 - CAM)

I give a 6 for video, and a 5 for audio. Best copy available yet, I believe."
,ReconRedneck2,2012-09-16T00:02Z,"Video is very dark. The rotating watermark is annoying if they had eased up on the contrast and the watermark this would have been a solid 9 on the video scale 
Sound is good when LFE is present is sounds hollow and boomy.

Thanks for this, no doubt this is the best there is for now. Hopefully the release group will learn how to use a transperant watermark on future releases, that right there is worthy of a nuke relating to scene releases."

,TheHeiliger,2012-09-17T10:39Z,"I'm very pleased with this, in spite of it being a TS. 

Yes, you will notice the murky picture, bass-heavy audio, and very-dark darks that you would expect from any TS, but overall, the higher resolution does make a positive difference. Regarding the audio, all of the dialogue (give or take several lines) is very clear, however I noticed that the audio seems to be just a touch higher in pitch than it should be.

This file is the complete film, from opening WB logo all the way to the closing WB logo. There is a source watermark/URL that appears on random corners throughout the film, as well as infrequent hardcoded Chinese subs for any onscreen written content (and for a song that is sung halfway through the movie).

Overall, a VERY good TS; if you are fine with something better than a standard TS, but not up to the quality of a DVD release, then this is worth the download. Thank you, Horrorspoke."
,whymichael,2012-09-17T20:06Z,I appreciate the effort but not really worth the download. Dark and blurry in general but quickly much more blurry with any movement on the screen. Thanks anyway.

[H],EverybodyLies,2012-09-18T18:16Z,All 720p videos are HD. The quality of the video is not considered while classifying it. 
,blanktom,2012-09-19T00:45Z,"@EverybodyLies this is a high res video of a movie screen that is showing The Dark Knight Rises *not* a high res Video of The Dark Knight Rises.   There's a BIG difference between the two.   

If I took a took a color video of The Artist, could I then say I had a video of The Artist in Color? no

If I took a cam of TDKR using a 3D Camera, could I say I had video of TDKR in 3D? no

So if I took a cam of TDKR using a high definition camera, i can't say it's a High Res Movie.   "
,nonobvious,2012-09-19T03:16Z,"Agreed. By that definition a 720p conversion of 480p video would be ""HD."" Retarded."
[H],EverybodyLies,2012-09-19T03:34Z,"Meh, you guys don't get it.
Highres videos only depend on the resolution of the video 720p, 1080p etc.........
The quality of the video is not a factor while determining if a video is Highres. The staff and VIP uploaders know this. That's why this video is still in Highres."

,ZLockwood,2012-09-20T05:10Z,"@EverybodyLies I think you're missing blanktom's point. Sure it's Highres but if you want to get technical and nitpicky about it you can't really call a screener a ""movie."" In a movie, the camera that was used to capture the images was on set, with the actors, and what you see at the theaters or on DVD/Blu-Ray is a digital copy of the original. With a screener it's an analog copy, it's an HD camera recording of a movie. So again, if you want to boil it down to technicalities, it's a ""video of a movie"" aka screener and not a ""movie."" So should it not be under some other category and not ""Movies""?

That being said, I don't really care all that much one way or the other, I always wait for a BRrip (the number of seeders/leechers here intrigued me to take a look at the comments). I just wanted to play devil's advocate and point out the flaws of your argument. Regardless, thanks to the uploader for identifying it as a screener!"

[H],EverybodyLies,2012-09-21T05:10Z,"I am too going into technicalities. I never said this was a real movie ripped from any physical media. The point is if a video is 720p, it comes in Highres Movies even if it is a cam video of a movie running in the theaters. "
,goldentongs,2012-09-21T15:01Z,"TPB seriosly needs to change the name of category from high-res to High-Def just to stop all this HDTS nonsense, they should also have a CAM category by now so all the crap can be put in one place, personally i fail to see what the uploader gets out of uploading stuff without a clear description, most people would prefer to watch porn rather than the number of downloads their torrent got to get off. The uploader should always have the courtesy to state CAM in the title of any file that is a CAM regardless of what resolution it is."

,HydroLion,2012-09-22T03:50Z,i agree with goldentongs... while im not arguing that this is in the right place (category-wise) the whole system is fucked up. there should be a different category all together for TS videos. it's misleading for people that may not understand the concept of what is HD or HQ and what isn't. who cares the quality of the camera it was shot with if the original copy is a lower quality to start. that makes no sense. just sayin
,HydroLion,2012-09-22T04:01Z,thanks for deleting my comment btw
[H],EverybodyLies,2012-09-22T04:43Z,Who deleted your comment?
,blanktom,2012-09-22T07:26Z,"@Horrorspoke.  First off, i appreciate the work you did to but please stop posting it in here.  This is *not* a High Def movie.   

you're right, soup is soup... but this ain't soup.  I don't go to the local Acme and ask them for a *picture* of their finest soup to feed my family.  "
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-22T11:46Z,"@blanktom....... Unfortunately, as this is '720p' it is 'High-Res'. 720p and 1080p are high-resolution, therefore, they must be posted in the 'high-res' category.

Maybe I should clarify my position on the 'soup' comment. Soup is soup - a picture of soup is NOT soup. All soup is soup, whether it be chicken, oxtail, whatever. Even if it is 'no-frills' cheap, rubbishy soup, it is still soup. Therefore if there were a category for soup, even though the quality of the soup might not be up to, say, 'Heinz Big Soup', it is still soup, and would be placed in the same place as the other soups as that is it's category.

(Hope that sort of clears it up lol)

"
,blanktom,2012-09-23T17:17Z,"@Horrorspoke  here's the problem.  Despite what you think, this is not a 720p copy of The Dark Knight Rises.   You can say it all you want, but that doesn't make it true.   The problem is that once it's put on ""the big screen"" you're going from digital to analgue back to digital and loosing quality because of that.   You'll never have3 a 720p copy of a movie by using a cam... the notation doesn't make sense.   

I don't doubt that this could be the best CAM of TDKR but it's still a CAM and doesn't belong here.   Maybe it's TPBs fault for not making the distinction in the catagories, but it does seem like most people understnad.  "
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-23T19:31Z,"@blanktom - It's not a CAM it's a TS. 

Also this category is 'High Resolution' NOT 'High Definition'. They are different. High Resolution relates to the IMAGE (pixels per inch), search it on google. 1280x600 IS 'High Resolution'. This IS the 'High Resolution' category. There you go! 

If there was a 'High Definition' Category, then this video probably wouldn't be there, it would be here, in 'High resolution', where it is now!"
,inemanja,2012-09-24T01:15Z,"@Horrorspoke   hd does not  relate do pixels per inch, but pixels per image (frame) - 720p = 720 lines of 1280 pixels = 921.600 pixels per image or about 1Mpix/frame.. on cinema screen that could be 2 pixels per inch
