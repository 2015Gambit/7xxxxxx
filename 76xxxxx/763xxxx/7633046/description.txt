While out flying on their dragons, the kids stumble upon a small dragon with
an injured leg. They bring it back to Berk - no one has ever seen this species
before, and everyone loves the new dragon, even Stoick, who names him Torch.
Everyone but Toothless, that is, who knows that Torch is the offspring of the
deadly Typhoomerang, who is heading towards Berk in search of her missing baby.
