Kasey Chambers - Wreck & Ruin

Released: 07 Sep 2012

In 2008 Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson became only the second married couple in the history of the Australian album charts to have an album collaboration debut at #1. Who was the couple prior? John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Nearly five years since the release of their last collaborative album Kasey and Shane have braved the perils of a married-couple-locking-themselves-into-a-small-space and have recorded Wreck & Ruin, the highly anticipated follow up to their 2008 platinum #1 hit album RattlinΓÇÖ Bones.

Kasey and Shane said ΓÇ£Having been almost five years since we made RattlinΓÇÖ Bones we thought it was time to 'Tempt Fate' and challenge our marriage by making another album together! ΓÇ£We have both made solo albums in between but in the back of our minds we always knew we would end up making music together again. ΓÇ£The writing process fell into place easier than we had planned so we grabbed some musician friends and recorded us all jamming the songs on a farm for a week. Wreck & Ruin was born and gave us a chance to revisit the sounds of music that we love to make together where it can be 'traditional' but not 'conventional'ΓÇ¥.

The cover artwork for Wreck & Ruinwas commissioned from UK based Australian artist Kerry Evans. The album is co-produced by Nash Chambers, Shane Nicholson and Kasey Chambers and was recorded at Foggy Mountain Studios
