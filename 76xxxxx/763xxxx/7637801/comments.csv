Islam is NOT the only religions that condemn the use of alcohol. You havent heard of of mormonism of which the presidential candidatet Mitt Romney confess to? This religion condemn the use of alcohol and the prophet Joseph Smith of the church of latter day saints even recognized Muhammad as a prophet as the only other religion than Islam to do that!

How do moman73 explain that if he really means that ALL drugs are prohibited by islam, why are most people of nations like Yemen shewing the DRUG khat all day long?

And slavery was PRAXIS in the whole of Islam during a long era, so dont come with bullshit that Islam abolished slavery. Quran condone slavery, although if you are born muslim you cannot be slave.

All other ""inferior"" people had to be slaves.

Missinformation only serves to sew hatred an bigotry among the peoples of Earth!

I thought you was an fighter for the truth, but you have showed me that you are just a bigot!

I am disappointed!"
,raenkae,2012-09-15T14:42Z,"moman73: Yes! Delusion is about quantity! 2 billion people are more easily deluded than just 10 because then they control all aspects of life and the information.

How is the progress of human rights in ""muslim countries""? How is the freedom of choice? How is the freedom of women? How is the religious freedom? How is the freedom FROM religion?

moman73, you can keep on hiding your thick head in the sand, or you can search for the REAL truth! With the internet it is easier than ever, and you seem to have internet-access!

Not the easily chewed bullshit that the fat and rich priesthood of Islam is feeding you all day long!"
,YetuAsili,2012-09-17T02:29Z,"Without getting too deep into your argument about morman73's tirade, I can say that no religion prohibits every single drug by normal definitions. Sugars, fats, chocolate are all drugs. Mormonism is NOT the only religion to recognize Muhammad as a prophet in addition to Islam, see for instance BahĂĄ'Ă­ Faith.

As for your questions, ""How is the progress of human rights in ""muslim countries""? How is the freedom of choice? How is the freedom of women? How is the religious freedom? How is the freedom FROM religion?"", that's a question with no one solution. There are many different countries with predominantly Muslim populations, and they are all different in these areas."
