,smokie_tonto_420,2012-09-14T02:09Z,Why is the movie called Four Assassins but the pic shows Far Away Eyes. Even the IMDB show Far Away Eyes. Just a little confused here on that one
,pilot_a321,2012-09-14T02:16Z,a? v? anyone?!
,mansriot,2012-09-14T02:41Z,"""The original title was ""Far Away Eyes"" and referred to the main character's state of mind.""

,end77,2012-09-15T01:20Z,"Just to give you a heads up, the entire movie is about 4 guys inside on hotel room chit chatting. Too much talk, little action."

,excelguy,2012-09-15T16:07Z,They have removed the comments for this movie on the Youtube trailers. Just because THE MOVIE IS FUCKING WORTHLESS. How the fuck can this shit be in the top100?! It's a low budget B-movie.

Quality of this movie is fine, nothing wrong there, but this must be one of the worst movies ever. 4 Assassins sitting in a room having a few, very boring flashbacks. The story is working towards a big conflict in the end, even though it is there, its SO weak and you feel so dissapointed because you hoped for a bigger fight.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD WASTE OF TIME"
