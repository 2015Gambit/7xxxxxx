Overview: NAVIGON Europe - GPS navigation
NAVIGON GPS navigation for Europe

+++ Latest version 4.5.0 now available +++

Important notes:
- New users: The software requires additional data (maps, voices etc.) via WLAN after installation!
- Galaxy Nexus: Sound works only proper when firmware update android 4.0.4 is installed!

With NAVIGON you can transform your Android smartphone into a fully functional mobile navigation system that is every bit as good as the multi-award-winning personal navigation devices from NAVIGON in terms of its user-friendliness and features. Thanks to a faithful adaptation of the menu functions, NAVIGON fits in seamlessly with the Android operating concept.
On-board navigation entails no data transfer or roaming charges, for example, for route calculation or map displays.
