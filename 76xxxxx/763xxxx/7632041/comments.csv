,SplhcbPrime,2012-09-17T09:28Z,"niiiiice upload, tomdaman! danka!!"
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-09-19T00:19Z,"X64 Version is up too.
Uploaded it with an extra .ISO for software install, like Office 2010 and much more.

Enjoy!!"
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-09-19T15:34Z,"I just found out that this doesn't install as an AIO version.... I forgot to delete the ""ei.cfg""file, to make it an AIO version.. Duuuhhh.   

If you want to install another version than Ultimate, unpack the ISO (with alcohol 120% or PowerIso or something similar) 
Delete the ""ei.cfg"" file, which can be found in the ""sources""-folder on the ISO and make it a bootable ISO again...

Sorry 4 the slip-up, shit happens, hope your all satisfied with the torrent anyways!

Grtz, TDM!"

[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-09-28T11:36Z,"I suggest you download daz windows loader 2.7.1.

Seems you forgot to use the loader that pops up at the end of the installation.

Download the loader, install and restart you should be fine then."
