---------------------------------

Controls (default):

*  Mouse -- Look around
*  W,A,S & D -- Move
*  Left Shift -- Jog/Sprint
*  Left Mouse Click -- Pick up pages
*  F or Right Mouse Click -- Flashlight
*  Q & E -- Zoom in/out

Tips:

*  The Slender Man can capture you if it gets too close.
*  Do not look at the Slender Man for too long, or you will lose.  The further you are, the safer it is to look.
*  Your flashlight has a limited battery; it will not drain while it is turned off.  You also can look at the
Slender Man longer while it is off.  However, having it off will make you easier to catch.
*  Jogging/sprinting causes your stamina to drop; it recovers when walking, and recovers twice as fast when 
standing still.
*  Sprinting causes your maximum stamina to drop slightly; jogging does not.
