,flacdude,2012-09-14T16:40Z,Forget my last comment. It took about an hour to get to speed then it went flying. Txs!
,flacdude,2012-09-15T05:25Z,THIS IS IT!!!Great remasters. Get it. Thanks to Spikkie for the healthy share.

,Mr_Stoned_the_bootlegger,2012-09-20T17:15Z,"Excellent torrent and in FLAC too - the REAL collectors really appreciate the locless FLAC format. 

The only album which (maybe) should be included in this torrent is... 

The Roxy Music - Why Do You Think I'm A Funky Chick?

I made the double vinyl album myself back in 1977 and it was released early 1978. 

Cheers... 

btw, jag har fortfarande enbart omslag till salu for den som ar intresserad :-) "
