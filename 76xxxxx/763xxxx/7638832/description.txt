Algebra can be fun by Yakov Perelman. 

From the Preface

    This is not an easy-reading text on algebra for beginners.
    Neither is it a manual. It is a book for free reading. It is
    designed for a reader with some knowledge of algebra, even
    though half mastered and perhaps half forgotten. The
    present text hopes to help the reader recall such haphazard
    knowledge and polish it up, the aim being to fix certain
    facts in his mind. It is meant to develop in the reader a
    taste for algebra and problem-solving, and also excite him
    to dip into algebra textbooks and fill in the blanks in his
    knowledge.

    To make the subject more attractive I have made use of
    a variety of tools: problems with intriguing plots to excite
    the reader's curiosity, amusing excursions into the history
    of mathematics, unexpected uses that algebra is put to in
    everyday affairs, and more.

This particular edition was edited and supplemented by V. G. Boltyansky and translated from the thirteenth Russian edition by George Yankovsky and was published by Mir in 1979.
