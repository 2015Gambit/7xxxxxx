[T],rkstr,2012-09-14T21:39Z,wow! 18 uploads this week and still I'm asked where's Project Runway like its my duty to upload it immediately every week.It would be nice to be recognized for what I do as opposed to what I haven't done.

I guess some of us only know, appreciate, back and constantly validate you for Project Runway and not the remainder of your 18 uLeds. In fact, as an individual I have only ever commented and thanked You and mdprosser, immensely. Always appreciate your effort, neva doubt that. "
