dirty Dali: A Private View
Salvador Dali is one of the most popular of all Surrealist painters, yet behind his image of dream and fantasy was a deeply troubled man of ambiguous sexuality and Freudian confusion. In this intimate film art critic Brian Sewell - who knew Dali at the point when his genius and reputation were both exhausted - gives his sympathetic private view of a man whose life and work were surrendered to sexual obsessions. Between 1968 and 1971, Sewell spent four intensely memorable summers with Dali in the artist's Spanish home town. When he knew Dali, the artist was living entirely freed from the constraints of morality, respectability and logic. At first hand, Sewell witnessed the day-to-day routine and recalls the details that vividly and dramatically illustrate both Dali's extravagant, flamboyant genius and the personal demons - sexual and psychological - that drove him and his work
