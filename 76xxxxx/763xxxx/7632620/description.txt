Video from Phish's three night run at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce, CO.

I downloaded the FLV webcast, but I wanted something to play on my PS3.

So, I demuxed the FLVs and remuxed them into TS files. All I had to do was convert the audio to AC3. The video is untouched.

Thought some people might want it, too. :)
