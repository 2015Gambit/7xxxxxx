"THE DOLPHIN-EXTRATERRESTIAL CONNECTION"

6-12-06 Kona, HI

Our workshop begins with a GUIDED MEDITATION deep into your imagination, preparing you for the journey of consciousness into the realm of dolphins and ET's. Bashar shares techniques and information designed to help discover your core being and introduces a new tools for re-wiring the neurological circuitry of your consciousness. We delve into dolphin consciousness when Bashar channels one of the "Dreamer Dolphins" and shares with us the dolphin perspective on living a joyous life. Bashar introduces a new tool for balancing the hemispheres of the brain and discusses enhancing the physical body to become a more conductive receptor of the higher frequencies. The dreamy GUIDED MEDITATIONS he takes us on are just wonderful for enhancing health and conductivity. We have several remarkable moments of synchronicity during this workshop--the first evening begins with a rainbow arching across the sky, and the session ends with an jolting earthquake that occurs the exact moment that Bashar disconnects from Darryl!
