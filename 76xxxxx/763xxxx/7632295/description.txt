The Africa Revolutions Tour is a project building on years of filmmaking and whitewater exploration. The film creates a new genre of action sports documentation that couples the adventure and excitement of extreme sport with cause-driven initiatives. The expedition provided opportunities to educate the people we encountered about their solar potential. Profits from this film will be donated to the Sun Catchers Project, a non-profit organization that installs solar cooking facilities in African orphanages, hospitals and communities.
