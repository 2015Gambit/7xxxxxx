13th November 2011
in Berkeley, CA

Audio ripped from DVDs, edited/cleaned for pauses ("uh" or "ahh"), stammers, mis-speaking/self-corrections, ten-second silences, etc.
Then cut by topic and length. Note that these were audio-visual presentations, with slides shown; when mentions of imagery became useless in this format (e.g., "Look at this"), this speech was excised.

This is the last set of speakers to complete the upload of audio from conference. Again, the audio was edited by myself. I have also uploaded MP4 video files of the raw, unedited video recordings ripped from the DVDs:
