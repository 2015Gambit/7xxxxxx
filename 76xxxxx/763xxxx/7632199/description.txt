An airlinerΓÇÖs controls abruptly fail mid-flight over the Atlantic. An oil tanker runs aground in Japan when its navigational system suddenly stops dead. Hospitals everywhere have to abandon their computer databases when patients die after being administered incorrect dosages of their medicine. In the Midwest, a nuclear power plant nearly becomes the next Chernobyl when its cooling systems malfunction.
      At first, these random computer failures seem like unrelated events. But Jeff Aiken, a former government analyst who quit in disgust after witnessing the gross errors that led up to 9/11, thinks otherwise. Jeff fears a more serious attack targeting the United States computer infrastructure is already under way. And as other menacing computer malfunctions pop up around the world, some with deadly results, he realizes that there isnΓÇÖt much time if he hopes to prevent an international catastrophe. 
    Written by a global authority on cyber security, Zero Day presents a chilling ΓÇ£what ifΓÇ¥ scenario that, in a world completely reliant on technology, is more than possible today---itΓÇÖs a cataclysmic disaster just waiting to happen.
