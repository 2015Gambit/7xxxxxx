[V],thegreenfrog,2012-09-16T21:24Z,"Larry, since these are your first torrents here, let me explain how to post pictures on this page.

in the field that says 'image tag for baying' you simply paste the code at the end of the URL with lower and upper case intact.

As an example , for this torrent the code would be 'bacOgaAee'. If you do that the image will show right on this page without the need to click on another URL.

I believe it is too late now for the uploads already done but you might want to try it.

Keep up the good work!"
