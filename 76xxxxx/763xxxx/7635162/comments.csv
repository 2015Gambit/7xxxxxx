,Zipgun,2012-09-15T16:26Z,"No big deal these guys looked like they copied some really old game like Uber Soldier or a some other crap game WWII along those lines as I remember a game where the krauts all had beards, just like in this game has.  Maybe someone else can chime in a remember what game I'm referring this crap to.

All this company did was change the main character textures add some voice acting and a different level and that's it. I swear all the other levels and textures are the same. This game is a totally lame. Budget bin trash all the way."
,Zipgun,2012-09-15T16:27Z,Btw nothing toward the uploader. Just the game itself.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER, SOFTWARE, DMD ENTERPEISER, UPRISING 44.
Now double click on a cdkey and zero value data and click OK …
after that just start the game"
