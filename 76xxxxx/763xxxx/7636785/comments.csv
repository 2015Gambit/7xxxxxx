You have stolen KaOs RIP and then fucked it up really bad. Your unpack.bat file doesn't even start coz U have wrongly placed the unpacker configuration files in tools folder. Even on transferring these files to main folder where setup.bat file is there, the unpacker starts but never instals the game completely (1.7gb). The CMD Window shows an error that some data file not found and then starts decompressing the other file. The launcher.exe does not work and IAMalive_game.exe terminates after showing Ubisoft video (after that there is no video only sound, then critical error Critical error....

I deleted game folder, reinstalled the game several times and same error every damn fucking time.
I am not a newbie to this kind of stuff as I have already installed and played several of KaOs RIPs without any problems but this is a case of REALLY FUCKED UP BADASS TORRENT.
YOU HAVE REALLY FUCKED THIS UP.
WASTE OF BANDWIDTH....I should have better downloaded the original KaOs RIP."

You are just a group of IMMATURE Repackers who get intimidated and baffled by CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. If your RIP is incomplete and deficient modification of KaOs repack, then what's the problem in accepting it...? Even a moron could tell that it is a KaOs RIP. You, if you open the ""~UnPack~.bat"" file in text editor you could clearly see that the commands instruct the unpacker module to First unpack the ""KaOs-Krew.000"" file and then unpack the ""KaOsKrew.001"" file and then other files like KaOsKrew.pcf etc are executed .
You simply renamed the [TITLE] header of ""~UnPack~.bat"" file by replacing [KaOs] by [THERAIN]. 

Now the MISTAKE that you made was that : YOU FORGOT TO INCLUDE THE DATA FILE NAMED ""KaOs-Krew.000"" 
and did'nt even care to delete the instruction that calls for unpacking this file in the ""~UnPack~.bat"" file. That's 
why the setup is incomplete. SEE BELOW :

ExtrasToolsKaOsUnPak x -wExtrasTools -y KaOs-Krew.000
Del KaOs-Krew.* >NUL......(where the fuck is KaOs-Krew.000 file)

See the full code :

YOU EVEN FORGOT TO ADD THE .exe extension to terms like KaOsArc, KaOsRep, KaOsCmp, KaOsArc etc.
In the last comment in code (Echo     Installed Have Fun Playing - KaosKrew) you didn't even cared to remove the name
name KaOsKrew.
Although YOU DID A GREAT EFFORT TO REPACK THE GAME (Thanks in Advance to You as an uploader) but YOUR 
UNACCEPTENCE TO POSITIVE CRITICISM (Highliting the follies) is simply IMMMATURISH.....(GROW UP...!!!)"

Downloaded the original KaOs RIP and it worked flawlessly. 
When KaOs-Krew.000 file from  KaOs RIP (that was missing in your RIP) was added to your unzipped repack even it worked nice.."
