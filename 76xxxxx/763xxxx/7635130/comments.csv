,zombird,2012-09-15T18:53Z,"Thanks. Judging by the trailer, the game looks funny and well made. Kinda has a Monkey Island vibe, the main character in this game reminds me a bit of Guybrush. "
,Xigor,2012-09-18T05:00Z,Is this only for Mac?
,zombird,2012-09-18T15:48Z,"xigor, this torrent is yes. I imagine there's a PC version up as well.

This is not as good as Monkey Island. Not by a long shot. I tried to get into it but just deleted it after the first 45 or so minutes. I just can't appreciate the humor I guess. The point-and-click/puzzle solving isn't as polished as other games either. 

It's about this guy that leaves this junk-riddled island and has to save some girl from the bad guys, basically. 

Anyway, thank you for the torrent still, I think some people will like this. Just know that it's a quirky point-and-click. "
