You need a comic book reader. They are free and abundant. Some good ones are...

CDisplay http://www.cdisplay.me/
CDisplayEX http://www.cdisplayex.com/
ComicRack http://comicrack.cyolito.com/
GonVisor http://download.cnet.com/GonVisor/3000-18488_4-75703753.html

My personal favorite is GonVisor, but most people use one of those other three, I believe. All of them are free, too. If you're on a Mac there is something similar available, I'm sure."
