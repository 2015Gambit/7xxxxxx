Yakov Perelman - Figures for Fun. 

From the Preface

    To read and enjoy this▼ book it will suffice to possess a modest
    knowledge of mathematics, i.e., knowledge of arithmetical rules
    and elementary geometry. Very few problems require the ability of
    forming and solving equations and the simplest at that.
    The table of contents, as you may see, is quite diversified: the
    subjects range from a motley collection of conundrums and mathematical stunts to useful practical prob]enls on counting and measuring.
    The author has done everything to make his book as fresh as possible,
    avoiding repetition of all that has already appeared in his othe▼r
    works (Tricks and Amusements, Interesting Problems, etc.). The
    reader will find a hundred or so brain-teasers that have not been
    included in earlier books. Chapter VI - "Number Giants" - is
    adapted from one of the author's earlier pamphlets, with four new
    stories added.

This edition was published by Foreign Languages Publishing House, published perhaps in the 1950s. The book was translated from the Russian by G. Ivanov-Mumjiev and was designed by D. Bistt.
