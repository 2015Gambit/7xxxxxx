Description:

SmartBackup is an inexpensive, fast and easy to use backup
software for Windows 2000/XP/Vista. On the one hand it helps you
to select your important files for backup, which results in a
short time needed for a backup. On the other hand it automatically
keeps your backups up to date and copies only files which really
have changed since the last backup.
                      
Additionally it allows you to synchronize your backup source and
destination, which makes it easy to keep your data files and
documents on your PC and your laptop synchronized. SmartBackup
offers detailed options to specify which files should be copied.
You can also specify an FTP Server or an ZIP File as backup
destination.
