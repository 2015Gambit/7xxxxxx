,giggedyguy,2012-09-16T04:04Z,Speed has definitely picked up. Thanks seeders.

30mins at least and the download was a joke compaired to the upload...

started downloading another copy,,,,less than an hour and even watched it when it was finished,,,i bet if i had left it to finish downloading i would STILL BE WAITING.."
