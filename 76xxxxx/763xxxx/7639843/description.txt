The torrent contains 340 monographs published by AGARD (Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development) between 1954 and 1996 on many of the topics related to Aerospace Research and Development, also known as AGARDographs. 

AGARDographs(Advanced Guidance for Alliance Research and Development) constitute the principal formal category of publications for work prepared by, or on behalf of, AGARDΓÇÖ s Panels. An AGARDograph must pertain to a single, clearly-defined subject and comprise material generally agreed to be of lasting interest. This material may be the work of a single author or be the coordinated and edited contributions of several authors. Often the preparation time for AGARDogrphs is measured in years rather than months.

AGARDOgraphs constitute one of the types of AGARD technical publications. All the files contained in this torrent can be found at
