[V],nikita200,2012-09-15T13:59Z,"Basta con questi Virus: il 99% dei keygen crea un algoritmo che viene interpretato come falso positivo, lo sanno anche i sassi.

Se non vi va, lasciatelo lĂŹ e non scaricatelo."
,chop007,2012-09-15T20:22Z,"Every crack shows up as a virus. I seriously cannot believe people still do not know this. It is a hacktool people classified by those dumb yanks who make the applications, as a virus because they want you to fear downloading hacked applications. Everyone should know by now that America controls the world through fear and intimidation even their own people are controlled by mass media fear propaganda. Anyways, over here we call it a false positive. The app is perfect, no virus, easy install, thank you nikita, gracias."
