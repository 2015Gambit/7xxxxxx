,kayisemfb,2012-09-16T05:13Z,"ya this also didnt come to south africa therefore thanx for sharing.

but its been on 0% the entire day"
,fuzzy4321,2012-09-16T10:51Z,Sorry guys meant to say it wasn't working. You can watch a perfect copy on CLAA7BLOGSPOT.IE and you dot have to download it.
,fuzzy4321,2012-09-16T10:54Z,Damb gave you the wrong site for the movie. It's HHB.ORG.UK my bad on he last comment. Other site has great underground hip hop
,sumosmurf,2012-09-16T19:56Z,"Your link doesn't work anymore, Fuzzy. VH1 took down the video."
,sumosmurf,2012-09-16T20:32Z,"If you went from 0% over the last day to suddenly getting something, that was me. I'll seed as long as I can. My speed isn't great, but it's better than being stuck at 0% forever.

Also, this is not a DVDRip. It's ripped from VH1."
