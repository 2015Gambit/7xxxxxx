How hard is it to do your own search?"
,soletar,2012-09-16T05:31Z,"Thank you ""friendly"" spidey for the links....

But fuck you for being an ass and a rude one at that!"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-09-16T15:17Z,"Soletar,

I helped you out with links you could've found in 60 seconds by using the search feature yourself. Don't know how I'm in the wrong when you don't even know how to use the site correctly."
,AxLR0Se,2012-09-17T00:05Z,"I finally registered after year's of visiting this site as a guest just to say this.. F*** You Soletar. It is ungrateful people like you who makes people not to share good stuff on these type of websites. You're ungrateful, needy, and a snub! You could of put in a little bit of effort and use the site's search engine to find your movies, but you don't. You instead whine and moan til you get your ways. You tell Friendlyspidey FU? No, Soletar, F*** you. Leave this site you scum. Tired of whiny pricks like you. If you can't find something on this site, why don't you spend the money, buy it, upload it, and share with us?  I've been here as a guest many times, and I bet I share 1000 times more than you."
