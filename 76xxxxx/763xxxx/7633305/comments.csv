,aj.ims,2012-09-14T20:27Z,Is it a Intel compatible distro & bootable ?
,_Milky_Way_,2012-09-15T03:45Z,"Yes, 100% Intel compatible & bootable. Exact distro sitting in the app store."
,madz679,2012-09-26T07:46Z,can we install this on a PC using UniBeast etc etc?
,mon_semblable,2012-09-27T22:50Z,"Installed yesterday, everything working great! 
Thanks a lot!"
,_Milky_Way_,2012-09-28T01:26Z,"@madz679 - I'm not sure if this is a workable solution for a PC utilizing UniBeast or not. My intention is simply to make available the same .dmg image in the App store, only small enough to fit on a single 4.7GB DVD should you decide to burn it. "
,kumpao,2012-09-30T17:16Z,"what about the update stuff? did this pass trought the verification process if there is one?
im noob about mac os.

tks in advance."
,RodWall5,2012-09-30T17:49Z,"There is no verification or activation process with OS X. Just install it, update it, and you're fine.
But, if you're doing a Hackintosh that's a different story."
