,sinnera,2012-09-13T22:36Z,"Please seed, and leave a comment if it worked! thanks."
,sinnera,2012-09-13T22:54Z,"As all torrents start out, there is extremely slow downloading. Please seed, and i re-assure you your download will be complete sooner or later."
,Resnem,2012-09-13T23:06Z,"Going nice, actually. :)"
,Jessetron,2012-09-13T23:08Z,"I will seed for a week if someone else does, I'm stuck at 91.7% thanks."
,koldas7,2012-09-13T23:27Z,i realy like a flac (not converted from mp3 ) version if its not to hard :)
,sinnera,2012-09-14T00:34Z,I will upload flac once the seeders reach a manageable number.
,a-bey,2012-09-14T04:03Z,thanks man
,SargeKroell5,2012-09-14T05:30Z,Thanks so much! SO much better than Alvin's copy. You rock!
,UDP7,2012-09-14T13:17Z,"If you can please get the FLAC version of this album , I'd appreciate that."
,GlitchRex,2012-09-14T16:23Z,"We need a .wav version pls, it's so much better than flac or mp3 bro !"
,koldas7,2012-09-14T17:03Z,wow you want to say please get us flac ? No way dude if u dont upload flac you are an idiot :)
,UDP7,2012-09-14T17:55Z,There's only FLAC version which is the only lossless version for audio on Bandcamp. And how is .wav better than .FLAC?
,UDP7,2012-09-14T18:21Z,Bandcamp only has FLAC version for lossless. FLAC is a lot better than WAV.
,sinnera,2012-09-14T23:29Z,"FLAC is a large file size, up to 1.4 Gigs. Please allow me some time to create the torrent. "
,sinnera,2012-09-14T23:36Z,"FLAC Version is up:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7636754

Here are the other Audio Formats that I offer. If enough people request them, I will add them:
MP3 VBR (V0)'
AAC
OGG VORBIS
ALAC

Note: MP3 320 and FLAC Are the largest file sizes, so there should be no need to upload the other formats. "
,S0lace,2012-09-15T07:27Z,"Thanks great torrent
Will seed"
,Hedgeyy,2012-09-15T08:01Z,"Honestly, this still isn't the quality I'm looking for. Something tells me you're still playing around with the original upload. "
,sinnera,2012-09-15T08:31Z,"Hedgeyy - I have no iodea what you're talking about. i BOUGHT This MYSELF from bandcamp. This is a direct upload of it. If you still don't believe this is truly mp3 320 KBPS, then that's your problem. 

Go download the FLAC version that i uploaded - that might suit your tastes.

Stop scaring away seeders. 

Please bring up Evidence that this isn't a legit seed. 

"
,endawmyke,2012-09-18T02:56Z,"made an account just to say this, can you please seed the MP3 VBR?"
,sinnera,2012-09-18T06:54Z,"@endawmyke

I can upload it to you personally somewhere, since I'm pretty sure not a lot of people will request mp3 VBR. '

Just pick a website with 300+MB filesharing service and ill give you a link."
,MrRedHead,2012-09-28T16:32Z,"Nice... I would like to have MP3 VBR too..
If you can... drop it on Dropbox so others can enjoy too!"
,Calacirian,2012-10-01T07:38Z,Great torrent. Thanks for the upload.
