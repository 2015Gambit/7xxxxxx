Video has been tested on 2 HDTVs (streaming) and 6 PCs (1 HDTV and 4 PCs I don't own) - none of which have issues.

At this time, it is expected that either 1) your computer or TV or WIFI accessories are a piece shit, 2) you have a problem with your codecs or 3) you need serious computer maintenance.

Sorry if that's blunt but I'm a small time supplier with little time to supply this stuff and all testing has met requirements and if you cannot support it, just download a shitty copy or watch it off TV.  There are no other solutions at this time and if it took more than 1 hour to download, don't blame me - I put out as much as 5.2 megabytes per second on these releases and if you're not getting it faster, upgrade your Internet or hit up news groups because it's almost always released there first.

Sorry.  Cheers."
