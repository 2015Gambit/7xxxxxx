,adranac,2012-09-15T15:21Z,Working or fake?
,dadeohdan,2012-09-15T15:23Z,How long does it last?
,Izuael,2012-09-16T03:21Z,"@adranac working, lots of seeders and no one complaining

@dadeohdan I'm not sure but I think you can keep it like this until some time after the oficial release date"
,dr_who1,2012-09-16T03:23Z,"This does NOT works.

Windows Update can't check for updates because the service is not running.... "
,Izuael,2012-09-16T03:34Z,"@dr_who1 how about you open services.msc as admin and look for ""Windows Update"" .. if the service is not running click in start. I can assure you your problem is not related to the patch"
,dr_who1,2012-09-16T04:01Z,"I tried again, it worked this time.
Still don't think this is the ""real deal"". "
,Izuael,2012-09-16T04:10Z,@dr_who1 I agree with you.. it's just a temporary solution for people (like me) who couldn't activate win after the russian kms server got closed :)
,yorlyx,2012-09-16T04:17Z,It works. It only removes Watermark and Activation Notification but it does not activate the windows 8 thanks for the upload Izuael let's wait for the activator! greetings friends

,dr_who1,2012-09-16T13:25Z,"that windows ""activator"" does not work, it only ""works"" for a dew days, I know because I had it before. I think it ""worked"" for me for 2-3 days without the blue screen asking me to ACTIVATE windows. 

I still have that annoying blue screen."
