,SectorVector,2012-09-14T21:01Z,Its a pretty book. I like the coverage in the later chapters. The 'enhanced' seems to refer to material available on a 'webAssign' website. Its a goldmine but access codes needed i think. Welcome back ... not you bbs. ;)
[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-14T21:29Z,"@SectorVector

You like the cover right? :)

It reminds me of summer here on my Island,which is just right around the corner :)))"
,SectorVector,2012-09-15T07:31Z,"Its a pretty picture certainly. What's not to like; although i'd prefer a hi-res version for a wallpaper.

OK, why don't i push a request. 'The complete works of Saki (H.H. Munro)'. Anything from 'Wordsworth classics' would be welcome (book flood)."
