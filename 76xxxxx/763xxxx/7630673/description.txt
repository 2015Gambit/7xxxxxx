Notes : Finnish rock band Hanoi Rocks played two dates (January 3 and 4, 1985) in Kulttuuritalo, Helsinki after their drummer Razzle died in a car crash in December 1984. Selected songs from the latter date were broadcasted across Europe as part of the "Europe A-Go-Go" TV show. The whole concert was later shown on Finnish television (TLE Teema) from where this DVD was created.
