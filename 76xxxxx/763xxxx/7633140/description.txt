I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nApo sila!_2012(camrip)

As the first Filipino production of its kind, it draws inspiration from the APO Hiking Society's hit music. 

The film stars Rock Polotan (Sam Concepcion), a young, nursing student and father-to-be from a struggling household. His father is one-hit-wonder composer Pol Polotan (Ogie Alcasid) who is married to Rose (Eugene Domingo), a caterer. But before he can marry his girlfriend, Tracy Fuentebella (Tippy Dos Santos), he must also woo her haciendero parents Nic and Elaine (Gary Valenciano and Zsa Zsa Padilla) and convince them that against all odds, to quote APOΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Panalangin,ΓÇ¥ wala nang iba pang mas mahalaga.

Right from the opening credits, the film endears itself with scenic views of the heart of Manila. No matter how much one dreads coming down to its streetsΓÇôfrom hawkers to her congested roadsΓÇôthe film warms one up to its consistent, idealized feel.
