Episode 11 is ""The Morning Dew Girl"""
,Morrowgamer,2012-09-16T01:44Z,Please hard-code your subtitles again. The past few episodes have not been hardcoded and thus I cannot play them over my Xbox onto the TV.

,DialupBroski,2012-09-16T12:32Z,"@Morrowgamer Hey you can also use a free software called Handbrake. I use it all the time to convert mkvs to mp4/m4vs so I can play them on my xbox 360. You can play around with settings, but I hardcode the subs onto the exported videos. It's also the fastest & best converter I've ever used imho. Google it and give it a try, that way you can have what you want every time ;)"

,Morrowgamer,2012-09-24T00:14Z,"@DialupBroski - I tried a few times, it doesn't seem to recognize that there are any subtitles. Will fiddle as much as I can but it doesn't seem to be working."
