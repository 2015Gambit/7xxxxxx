,disneydreams,2012-09-14T02:30Z,"This is strange
the episode says Sept 12 2012
but the file name says ""Y&R Sept 11 - 12.avi""
i believe your files are miss typed.
I have to keep renaming the files?!
Thanks for the uploads!
I get them daily or get several days at a time"
,katien44,2012-09-14T03:34Z,"have a great time,you've earned it,thanks again.oh ps we dont care what date is on them as long as we get them,cheers."
,jaimelove,2012-09-14T16:41Z,"@disneydreams: There is nothing wrong with the way the files are named.  The episode date is the air date in the US, and the file date (usually the day before) is the air date in Canada.  We get it a day before the US.  No need for you to rename all the files...they are correct.  Just depends where you live!
Thanks Ms. Fenmore...you rock!"
,disneydreams,2012-09-17T18:32Z,"@jaimelove, thank you my mistake i didnt know that you get them a day ahead. thanks"
