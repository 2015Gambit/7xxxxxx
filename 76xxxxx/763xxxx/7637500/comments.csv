[T],SecTPB,2012-09-15T06:51Z,"Roy Nelson is a TUF winner. He's also never been KO'd. Parrying him with Shane, who is known to beat everyone by KO in the first round of every fight up until his Lesnar fight, poses a really good threat to Nelson's chin. "
,Lurgid_Wight,2012-09-15T07:12Z,"Nelson's a badass, you need to go watch his highlight reels."
,amisegaa,2012-09-15T08:28Z,SEEEED KURVI
,Jack0ff,2012-09-15T08:47Z,"to clairify roy neson IS a badass! but you cannot teach 'how to get hit in the face repeatedly and keep fighting'...that is my point. roy nelsons skills are like george forman in that he takes hits and keeps advancing on you. this is not something you can teach, its natural. my problem with roy nelson is his ""skills"" cannot be taught."
,DanaBlack,2012-09-15T09:34Z,"Try seeding, ya selfish fucks it don't kill you to leave it on for a day, and thanks SecTPB for the upload."
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-15T10:45Z,No problem. :)
,ride29er,2012-09-15T10:45Z,"Roy Nelson has top level BJJ, you guys clearly have no idea what your on about 
youtube his vid were he submits Frank Mir in a BJJ comp"
,Motion69,2012-09-15T12:42Z,Seed guys and thank you secTPB for the upload.Awesome stuff!
,blehxor2,2012-09-15T12:51Z,Just me or did the audio cut out near the end. didn't get to hear anything of the fight picks at all. video and audio glitched a lot before the sound cut out completely too. 2.3gig upload and it's crap. can't wait until someone else throws up a better copy.
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-15T13:07Z,"@blehxor2
Just you, and if you're looking for a quality rip it's not going to get better than this. Sounds like you just can't handle the file or have bad decoding codecs. Play the file in Windows Media Player. May resolve the issue without trying a million things."
,jpopp98,2012-09-15T13:29Z,damn that's a big file. could anyone upload a smaller one? it's taking hours to download :(
,ekapan,2012-09-15T17:19Z,fuck thiz huge ass file niggha
,l337m4n,2012-09-15T20:03Z,"Nope crap copy, about half way through the sounds starts skipping then cuts out right before the Alvey fight."
,Melo22,2012-09-15T20:31Z,"I'd like to know if anyone can help with with this issue I have. Most 720p videos Are very laggy and ""spikey"" is this because of my monitor or what? Because its the same problem I have when watching 720p+ on youtube. Thanks in advance. oh and Roy a fat turd? The guy is a beast cant even get knocked out even if he gets hit 30 times over and over."
,thiagosilvabygnp,2012-09-15T20:38Z,thanks homie
,Catrach0,2012-09-15T21:57Z,Thanks Keep them coming!
,Motion69,2012-09-15T22:54Z,"I is true.Everuthing's fine,but the sound goes off at the end before the last fight.Tried everything."
,fitzy270,2012-09-16T00:28Z,Its way way out of sync as well as the other probs mentioned
,otnemem,2012-09-16T01:19Z,"SecTPB, don't be arrogant. It skips several times and audio goes off at about 1h10.
Unless a computer that eats 40GB 1080p files and every scene release available suddenly can't handle a crappy 720p file.
Also, for a 1h20 720p at 2.3GB, IQ is nothing to write home about.

I'm negging this one. Not quality at all."
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-16T01:19Z,"To everyone having trouble, it's a resource heavy file. It takes a good PC to play these videos. The best player for my files will always be WMP. Never use VLC. MPC-HC is okay. Remember, the frame rate is 3x's more than the average frame rate. Re-encode it or burn it to disc if you have trouble. There is no error in the file. Suggested codec back is Shark007's while using suggested settings(LAV codecs). "
,Aznagroth2,2012-09-16T01:30Z,"There are some parts in the video where the sound is a bit distorted and there are some coloured squares that flashes really fast away, like there are some tiles without texture.  I didn't notice any sync problems or any loss of sound at the end like some others reported.  Some good fights *smile*"
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-16T01:36Z,"@Aznagroth2
Yeah, the broadcast itself had little blips of pixelation at random points. They'd last for about a second but don't interfere with the watching of the episode since it's not a frequent thing.

@otnemem
Mostly everyone plays what I produce just fine. There's always someone who can't play it and blames it on the file itself. They are unaware they need a good system for 60FPS/720p. In many cases, this is more resource heavy than any 1080p. "
,jayellis25,2012-09-16T03:51Z,"I doubted what SecTPB said but it's right.  I used windows media player, and the sound stayed.  Anyone know any other good alternative vid players (vlc esque)?"
,ChronicPirate04,2012-09-16T04:21Z,"I have a good computer.. I can play the file in VLC with no problems until the 1 hour point where the sound will cut out. I tried playing it with WMP (i have the latest version) and it says it cannot play that type of file. I torrent all the time, I watch 1080p videos with VLC player on a regular basis. This is good quality but the sound cuts out and you're telling ppl not to use VLC (the program most people recommend)? I appreciate the effort but theres soemthing wrong with the torrent and your solution of using WMP didn't work, just letting you know."
,ChronicPirate04,2012-09-16T04:29Z,VLC cuts out audio around the 1 hour mark.. Not performance issues on my computer cause i can play the rest of the video perfectly fine.. WMP doesnt recognize the file and i have an updated version so dunno what you're talking about. Great quality besides the audio issue but took forever too download and audio issue is significant.....
,usethisusethis,2012-09-16T04:32Z,"Thank you SecTPB, this is quality mp4 work you put up.  Thanks also for doing TUF which the other tv uploading TPB'ers seemed to overlook.  "
,A_Dying_Baby,2012-09-16T06:05Z,yeah some seeds would be nice

,Taevious,2012-09-16T07:23Z,"Others have already said this, I'm just reaffirming it. About an hour in, the audio is a little glitchy and my system can definitely handle files of this quality just like others (done so before). It's not the hardware. That being said, I don't think it's shit like others have implied or flat-out said. Plus, he's one of the few people to actually take the time to record it, encode it, and upload it. Show a little gratitude you silly finger-painters. Thanks uploader, good stuff."
,thebigredcar,2012-09-16T08:30Z,"Great quality, cheers"
,brott,2012-09-16T09:15Z,"Had the same problem with VLC, no sound after 1 hour and a few minutes (and a few glitches here and there). WMP did work, though. Win7 x64, WMP 12.0.7600.16385, K-Lite Codec Pack x64. Thanks for the upload!"
,torrntzmakemepurr,2012-09-16T09:21Z,WTF happened to the audio towards the end?!
,mibmib007,2012-09-16T15:58Z,hm is this the only version out on piratebay? kinda lame
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-17T07:02Z,"I've watched this over several times and never had an issue on multiple players, but several reports of an issue like cutting out at a certain point does seem odd, so there's something going on. Possibly while creating the torrent the file didn't fully get processed or something. I'm not sure of the cause. Although it has been reported that if played in Windows Media Player, as I earlier suggested, it does work without that issue. I'll look further into the issue for next week's release to prevent it from occurring again. For now, make sure to use Windows Media Player. My files will always work best in it because they are transport stream rips, direct from TV. "
,wolfymain,2012-09-17T08:35Z,Thanks for the up!  Played fine.
,dagsbouch,2012-09-20T12:00Z,"i watched it all with sound but your right the sound did go funny at times but it didn't go it just went a bit behind and pixeld but it was worth it for me any way thanks heaps, i have been waiting for this plus its been so long since 'ufc' was on so keep up the good work well done ."
,feraledge,2012-09-21T04:50Z,"Played perfect for me, thanks!
Any chance of the Australia vs UK 'The Smashes' season that just started?"
,s8n,2012-09-21T06:24Z,Any chance you can get The Ultimate Fighter Australia vs UK ( the smashes). 1st ep aired on FX 19/9 at 7:30pm AEST. Cheers. 
,ChronicPirate04,2012-09-21T08:10Z,"Just wanted to say thanks again because besides the little bit of the audio issue which is apparently fixable , the quality is otherwise outstanding."
,Smetovski,2012-09-21T18:30Z,"I appreciate your efforts man, but im always having problems with your rips, mostly with the audio."
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-22T05:58Z,"I will check to see if I get TUF: The Smashes. If I do, expect it uploaded. If not, it won't be uploaded. lol. :)"
