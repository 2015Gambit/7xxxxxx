,basisdude,2012-09-20T06:09Z,"wtf the file is rar and now I have to fill in a survey  (and give my email address) to get the password to unlock the video ???  Btw most of these surveys do not want to hear from anything other than a US postal code SO it will not work.

Maybe I am missing something here but wtf !!!"
