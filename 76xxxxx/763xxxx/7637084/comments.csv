,maillort,2012-09-15T07:33Z,hey nubs stop recording in outdated AVI. use mp4 or mkv
,Kra3zd,2012-09-15T08:31Z,"malesnort- Quit complaining and let UL'r do what he wants. If you don't like it- download it , change the format, and then up it how you want it. Personally, avi plays better on my tv. So thanx for the UL and after I watch it I'll post quality. "

,rugburn11,2012-09-16T03:05Z,WOW WOW WOW GREAT MOVIE.......TOP MARKS. Thanks Scene4all
,Ravenon,2012-09-16T07:21Z,"Mallort, there's nothing outdated about avi, and in fact it's much better than MKV will ever be. Just a simple thanks for the upload, and Sparks time for the share. Cheers"
,darki699,2012-09-16T11:54Z,"Why AVI? AVI is more player compatible with other devices. To convert an MKV into an AVI is a real mess, MP4 is better than MKV, but if you have a small error in the file, it is pretty much ruined.

On the other hand an AVI can be easily converted into any file format, and is the most reliable compressed movie format. Also most devices can read AVI

tnx for the ul :)"
,tonganlad,2012-09-16T13:29Z,"fuck mp4/mkv!

,rev_devin,2012-09-18T06:19Z,"I have VLC and MKV's are extra choppy. I think that  AVI and MP4 are better because they play in my XBOX and PS3. I got rid of my cable because of torrenting and I just use my XBOX360, PS3 and HDMI cable to watch my shit and sometimes MKV can be a kick in the ass! But I'm rambling!! Thanks for the torrent! Will seed, as always!  "

Top film. Its one of those films your GF drags you too and you moan about it but then realize the film is great and tell everyone about it.

Most def recommend. "
