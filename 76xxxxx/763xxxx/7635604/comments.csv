,TyStark13,2012-09-15T16:59Z,Hey. :) Sorry to bother you; but do you do discography requests? Thanks. :) x
,zoso5150,2012-09-16T16:37Z,"TyStark13,if you type in discography and the band you want,you might get lucky,there are a few uploaders who specialise in just that.(hope this helps) :)"
[V],smbdownload,2012-09-17T03:34Z,"I usually do just single album uploads - mostly because I am too lazy to compile all and then have multiple GB uploading for days and days - I rip - and upload in one day then drop off and give it to the group to keep it going :-)

rock on ~ peace"
