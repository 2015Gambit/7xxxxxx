                       Trillian Pro v5 2 Build 13 incl patch-iOTA

Trillian Astra is an instant messaging service that has a twist: it lets you combine all your friends from several messengers on a single interface, so only one application will be opened when you want to talk to everyone on your lists.
This software imports all the contacts of your selected instant messaging platforms (Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, ICQ, Skype), but it can also directly access social networks (Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter, LinkedIn).
