,erraticchevy,2012-09-14T05:12Z,audio is delayed when played through ps3
,corrosiv3,2012-09-14T05:55Z,A DVD rip is not high-res.. Take this bullshit elsewhere..
,kyinlvnv,2012-09-14T12:27Z,the upscaled version is more clear
,maurodudu,2012-09-15T02:32Z,fake fake no 720p is dvdrip
,maurodudu,2012-09-15T02:34Z,fake
,oBomba,2012-09-15T03:40Z,"To SYNC audio use MKVmerge. Select 'Format Specific Options' (for video track only) and enter -1000 in the 'Delay in (Ms) box. Under 'Extra options' select 'none' for compression on both Audio and Video track. Uncheck the 3rd track if you want English only. After this has finished you can use MKV2VOB if you want to convert and watch on PS3.
Audio and video are both decent. Anyone who complains is either lying or extremely fussy.
THANX TEAMEXD!"
,tflagger997,2012-09-15T03:45Z,"Remember that most of the extra content that supposedly fills in the missing blanks in the story is on the BluRay, so this DVD (not 720p) will not have it.  Wait another two weeks."
,waspo,2012-09-15T17:13Z,"I never had any sync issues playing through VLC player or on my TV. But like obomba said, I used MKVMerge and removed the Hindi audio, so maybe that helped. Video and sound are both great. Maybe not bluray but definitely DVD quality. Well worth the download!!!
The movie itself was pretty good too!"
,ManuelRivero,2012-09-16T12:48Z,upscaled crap. Badly upscaled I should add.
,Grondaivor,2012-09-17T00:26Z,To everyone whining about this. Just because it says 720p doesn't mean its HD. When movies are moved to Disc's they are down scaled from 5k - 2k recording and thats often how you get your 1080p and 720p. Look for 'BrRip' to determine high quality vs DvdRip upscaled quality. TeamExD should take note that Upscaling does not increase overall quality. You can slightly increase Bitrate to help pixalating but overall its about Bluray source and best Encoding.

Quality is much better than I expected for an upscaled DVD-rip.  You won't be disappointed with this file unless you're expecting 100% perfect Blu-Ray quality audio and video.  This is definitely the next best thing until the Blu-Ray is available.  

The movie on the other hand was largely disappointing.  Almost as if the person editing the movie had no communication with the director and no script to work from, so they just edited together whatever footage they liked in whatever fashion they thought made the most sense.  Very disjointed and it has some huge plot holes.  Too bad, it had potential, but it's worth watching once."
