This one-off documentary tells the disturbing true story of a bizarre kidnapping case that took place in America in the late 1970s. In northern California, a sexual sadist abducted a young woman and kept her in a coffin-sized box for seven years, relentlessly abusing and torturing her. But when the case came to court some years later, serious doubts were to emerge as to what had actually taken place.

On 19th May, 1977, Colleen Stan was hitchhiking through Red Bluff in California when she accepted a ride with Cameron Hooker, his wife Janice and their baby daughter. Hooker drove to the outskirts of the town and stopped, allowing his wife and child to leave the car. He then grabbed Colleen and blindfolded her, before fitting her with a homemade contraption that was to become known as the ΓÇÿhead boxΓÇÖ. ΓÇ£The purpose of the head box was to prevent people from hearing you scream,ΓÇ¥ explains Al Shamblin, a former Red Bluff police chief.
