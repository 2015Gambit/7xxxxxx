,xxdocxx,2012-09-14T03:41Z,@psspss do you mind telling me the program you use to covert your files to xvid. or at least one you would recommend.
[V],psspss,2012-09-14T04:12Z,"normally several depends 

avs converter 8.2
then if out of sync I fix with avimuxgui

i make a custom profile for 640x360 and choose
lamemp3 cbr 128 and mix to stereo
and set kb rate to 1008 and fps leave as is

to rip streams can use downloadhelper plugin for firefox and for others that are encrypted tubedigger

other converters can use and more complex
are avidemux,org and Megui
both are free
again need to setup a profile as above"
