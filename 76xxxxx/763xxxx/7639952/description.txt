Around The World In 80 Gardens 
Around the World in 80 Gardens is a BBC series that follows broadcaster Monty Don as he travels all over the planet searching for world-class gardens - ancient and modern, large and small, grand and humble. In total, exactly eighty gardens are featured during his 10 journeys, and include the Alhambra, the gardens of the Taj Mahal in India, the gardens of the Villa D'Este in Italy and many important botanic and royal gardens from Thailand to Bali, from New Zealand to Europe and from China to Mexico.


7)  Spain Morocco and Italy 
Monty Don continues his extraordinary journey in the Mediterranean - the cradle of European civilization. In Italy, Monty visits some of the elaborate high Renaissance gardens of stone and water which have hugely influenced western garden design. He also visits the remains of Emperor Hadrian's palatial retreat. Monty then looks at the artistic achievements of the Moorish culture. He travels to Marrakesh, where he visits The Aguedal - one of the oldest continuously maintained gardens in the world; and in Spain he visits The Alhambra, thought by many to be the most perfect garden in the world.
