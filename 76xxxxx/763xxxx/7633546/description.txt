Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Here's the latest from the one of the outfits that has shaped, at least, how I think of music. The Orb introduced me to the concept of ambience, and their collaborations have settled them into quite the late period. Sounds great in surround, of course.
