What Exactly Is An "Ultimate Master"

 It is more or less a catchphrase originally used to designate something was a hi-res rip. But since there seems to be
 a lot "similarly" <cough> named rips now I guess I should explain.
 I try to present the "ultimate mastering" of a particular LP, the "mastering" is not my equipment or process but the
 source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to
 change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is "definitive" is irrelevant to me, I just
 try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or
 japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent
 the best source 95% of the time.
