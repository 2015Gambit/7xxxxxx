That being said, you should believe me when I say that this is a really good quality upload! Ok, the audio sucks, but the video is as good as those preview dvds the movie companies gives out to a selected audience.

To prove my point, here's a couple of screenshots:

Viewed on a laptop this is a great experience! Only thing you need to - interaction wise - is to sync the audio, which is easily done with the very suberb VLC.

My advice: DOWNLOAD if you can't wait to see this flic!!!

My advice to the uploader: GET US PREVIEWS IN THE SHAPE OF SCREENSHOTS AND SHORT CLIPS!!! You have nothing to be ashamed of, particularly with this one. FLAUNT YOUR GOOD SHIT, neglect to upload your bad shit."
