I've recently ended up in a hospital bed and am stuck using throttled, overcrowded WiFi and my own cell phone for internet.

I'm uploading as much as I can, but I really need somebody with a better connection to help get this modestly sized Torrent off the ground.

If you're really inspired, you can even grab each episode from the Search link I provided in the description above, download & seed those, then tell this torrent to Force Recheck in the same directory. Then the same files can Seed both the individual episode Torrents and the full 01-19 collection."
