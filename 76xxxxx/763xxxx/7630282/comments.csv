,sinnera,2012-09-13T15:50Z,"Ok, the commenters might be right. However, this is better than alvin's version definitely. I'll try to upload m4a/other formats when the time comes.


PLEASE DO NOT DL THIS TORRENT. HIGH QUALITY TORRENT COMING UP SOON."
,sinnera,2012-09-13T15:53Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, HIGH QUALITY VERSION OF TORRENT COMING UP IN ABOUT 5 HOURS. PLEASE WAIT."
,Hedgeyy,2012-09-13T18:44Z,The FLAC uploaded is fake. There's no point in ripping from it.
,sinnera,2012-09-13T22:22Z,"Do NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT, as it was ripped from a Fake FLAC SOURCE. I have a new torrent up directly from BANDCAMP, with TRUE MP3 320 KBPS.
