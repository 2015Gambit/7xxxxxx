2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

My year-to-date count is now up to 988 releases.  That means I'm merely 12 albums short of my goal of sharing 1000.  And I've easily got that, and then some, already waiting to be shared in my next bundle.  Which, in all probably hood, may very well be my final bundle of the year unless everyone wants me to try and keep this thing going for a while longer.

This 38th bundle today includes lots of metal (Becoming The Archetype, I Am King, Imari Tones), the usual amount of hip-hop and rap (Group1Crew, SM Souljah, Urban Soldiers), some gospel (Essential Gospel Classics), rock (Neal Morse, The Icarus Account), blues (Rita Engedalen And Margit Bakken), and even country (Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Cook).  It's got a spanish/english single (Ricky Webber), as well as a french/english compilation album (Dan Ar Braz).  In short, hopefully something for everyone ... And all for God!
