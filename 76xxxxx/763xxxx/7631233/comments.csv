,Pko66,2012-09-18T22:42Z,:-( It is blocked at 99.83% after several days. I've shared more than 200% now.
,mf-den,2012-09-22T12:24Z,"@Pko66: I have been seeding it since the day I have posted it and that too, I have kept initial seeding. But it has had too many hit-and-runs as at one point I saw around 75 leechers. Dont know how only s01e07 can be incomplete, anyways I have kept it at high priority right now. Just let me know by tmrw if u get it, if nothing works will put that episode alone as a separate torrent. ANd thnk u for seeding"
,esdii,2012-09-22T22:37Z,"@mf-den May I suggest turning off initial seeding temporarily? That may resolve the seeding issue...
(I'm stuck also)"
