Plot: Sean (O'Dowd) is the imaginary friend of 12-year-old Martin Moone, the youngest 

child of a family living in a small town in Ireland. Martin has a unique perspective 

on life aided by an imaginary friend. His imagination comes into play both in his 

childish drawings, which come alive through animation, and in the ridiculous schemes
