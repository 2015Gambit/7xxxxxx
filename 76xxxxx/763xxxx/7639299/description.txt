Requirements: Varies with device

Features:

- Widgets in a tile! (provided that widget fits)

- Almost real like tile re-arrange mode
- Almost real like status bar

- Folder tiles

What's in this version:
This update should be delivered for ICS and JB devices only.
- Several 4.x fixes all around the L7
- Brand new tile adding and modification dialogs
- White background should now work properly
- Mail tile should not do unnecessary flips anymore
May still have some issues, but is generally lot better in 4.x than 1.1.13.2 so I decided to do the release.
Update for older devices will come, you have not been forgotten.
