,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-09-13T21:52Z,"I have some sbd's from the Dead and the Other One's.  There's actually a SMOKIN' audience recording i have (sounds really good) from 9-23-00 in Live Oak, FL.  That one is my favorite (even compared to soundboards I have from The Other One's).  The Dead performances are OK, but I personally prefer the Other One's and Furthur."
,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-09-13T22:15Z,"also, for the dead shows, i've been including text files labeled DEADHEAD REVIEWS which give first hand accounts of people who were at the shows.......i love reading those (it helps me determine if i want to download them too)."
,lex860,2012-09-14T15:41Z,"I've read all the reviews you put out with the downloads.I like reading about other peoples adventures,and why they liked that show.For ex,You wrote how evertbody held hands when the boys busted out The Wheel out of space.That's just cool.I personaly like the Other Ones the best.But it's hard to find sbds.I'd love to hear your 9-23-00 Peace & Thanks lex"
,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-09-16T01:52Z,"I'll post the show from 9/23/00 this weekend (The Other One's).  I hope it sounds as good as it does in my head.  With Bruce Hornsby playing with them, it made that show perfect....one of my favorite concerts, and i've been to over 300 shows and saw tons of legends play...  :)"
