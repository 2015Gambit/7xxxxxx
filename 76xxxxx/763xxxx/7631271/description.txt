C'est Fun~Cajun Classics (Pickwick) [FLAC] {MKOP}

This CD features many of the younger Cajun artists from Louisiana. There are modern-style bands like Jambalaya and Cajun Gold, together with older sounding but still young bands, like Tasso Cajun Band and Balfa Toujours. The majority of artists here record for the Ville Platte-based Swallow Records, which has been the leading Cajun label for over 30 years. To give a balanced view of the changes in Cajun music, the final four tracks feature vintage-recorded Cajun music from the revered Goldman label of Lake Charles. Included are three of the most famous accordionist in Cajun history: Iry LeJeune, Aldus Roger and Joel Sonnier. Despite the early recording techniques the vibrant Cajun spirit shines through. What you hearing here is over 250 years of Cajun singing and playing in all its joy and sorrow. But the triumphant emotion is, well, 'C'est Fun'! ~from the liner notes
