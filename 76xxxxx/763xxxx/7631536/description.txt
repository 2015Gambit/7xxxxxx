Completely organized epub library, when I say organized I mean as many know you can add a book series to your e-reader and they will sprawl all over in no particular order, and are very annoying to find, I have solved this problem by changing multi author series like Star Wars and Forgotten Realm's author name to the series name, then using sub series names and a number system so all of your books will load 1) by author, 2) in timeline order, and reading order, this torrent is part 1 of a project I am working on atm, it has a little over 2,200 e-books, over 80 authors ( or Series like Stra Wars, Forgotten Realm's, Dragonlance, Battletech ), if you are a Nook user, this is ready to load into your e-reader, if you are not, just download Calibre ( a free ebook converter ) and bulk convert them to your prefered fprmat, or just convert the files you wish to keep, change only the format if you want them all to still show up in perfect reading order ;), anyways, as I said, this is part 1, part 2 I will release in around 9 week's if I work on it at a decent speed ( part 2 will have 8k books in it ), enjoy;)
