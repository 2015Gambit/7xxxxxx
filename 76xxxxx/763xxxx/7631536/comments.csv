,juggys69,2012-09-13T16:17Z," This is probably The Best Sci-Fi & Fantasy Library you will find out there, and its just part 1 as I have already stated, working on part 2, and should get that out to you all in around 9 week's, enjoy ;)

 A juggys69 Production."
,juggys69,2012-09-13T16:35Z," Looking for Lords of the Sky by Angus Wells,

 The Golden Queen by Dave Wolverton,

 Beyond the Gate by Dave Wolverton and

 Lords of the Seventh Swarm by Dave Wolverton

 to add into my library and part 2 of the project if anyone out there can help me out, also need Fate of World's by Larry Niven ( only book missing in the Ringworld precursor series in part 1 ), also, if anyone has requests they would like to see in part two, leave a comment with the request and I will try to facilitate the request ( so its known ahead of time, I do not really consider Vampire stuff Sci-Fi or Fantasy so please don't add those to the requests, they should be considered horror, soft horror, or in some case romance LOL )"
,mrmagoo25,2012-09-13T17:47Z,"why would you put them in one big archive, instead of letting people pick what they want."
,juggys69,2012-09-13T19:15Z," Erm if you look around most archives are the same, and have less book's, delete the ones you don't want, its less then 2 GB, and all authors are in their own sub folder's, look around there are torrents 5-10 GB same way with less book's, you don't want it don't download it, or better yet make one yourself, or just sit back and complain, its what most are good at~~~"
,kmell1,2012-09-13T20:13Z,"It is a valid complaint to having all books in a rar archive instead of making a torrent where you can pick individual books. Way too often these .rar files contains another passworded .rar file + a .txt file explaining where and how to get the password, and to get the password you may have to respond to a questionnaire/survey."
,faggot1999,2012-09-13T21:31Z,"""It's less than 2 GB."" Indeed. But some people still pay per GB."
,juggys69,2012-09-13T21:57Z," Well it doesn't, I don't pull that password crap on people, I did a full indexing of the book's, which was  hours upon hours of work, if people don't want it, they by no mean's have to download it, seeing as I JUST made this torrent today and its already up to 200 seed's, I think anyone with 2-3 brain cell's can figure out that this isn't some type of scam.

 if someone want's to make every sub folder into a zip file, which would be another couple of hour's work, they can be my guest and reseed it, although at that point I will not be responsible if THEY decide to do that password crap on you guy's.

 Seriously, I did this because it was/is something that needed to be done, and I saw no one else doing it ( most e-book folder's with even approaching this many books is totally disorganized and chaotic, this one you can clearly see which books go in which series and in a coherent reading order and timeline ), a simple TYVM would be nice instead of a couple of random complaint's about me not doing even more work on it, takes you 1 second to delete a author folder you don't want, if you can't handle doing that, well I see no hope for you~~"
,senseinai,2012-09-13T22:20Z,"I know it's hard to take a critique when you are generously sharing, but this issue comes up over and over again: the consensus is that people really prefer a list, or separate files. Definitely an issue."
,juggys69,2012-09-13T22:42Z," Same comment, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT, PERIOD, download it or not, no biggie here, complaining to get me to add a couple hour's of work to my workload isn't going to get me to do it, seeing as the next one is going to be even larger, DON'T DOWNLOAD that one either, your loss, I don't really care, seeing as it's at over 250 seed's now, I really think most don't mind, so complain away, that's what some are good at doing, not fixing something they way they want, just complain, seriously~~"
,ed21850,2012-09-14T12:18Z,"You are right, we don't have to download RARed books. And I won't."
,ericb2038,2012-09-14T15:46Z,"Seriously, I finished dowloading it, and opened the archive, man YOU DID A GREAT JOB. The only thing missing imho is a text listing of the books on this page (or in the torrent itself), which could help alleviate the objections some people have at having to download it blindly.

Still your classification is really great. I loaded the whole collection in my Calibre library and, as far as I've seen, it came clean, easy to order, easy to find.

I for one salute the gigantic amount of work you put in this and feel VERY grateful for your effort.

Cheers :)

(PS and I'll make sure to wait for the next part :) )"
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-09-14T16:32Z,"If I can throw my two cents in, it is really no more difficult to create a torrent of a directory hierarchy that maintains the folder hierarchy as well as allows individual files to be selected as it is to do the *same* procedure to create a RAR archive of the same hierarchy and make a torrent from that.  

BitTorrent, Vuse, and others all have the option to select a directory and make a torrent from its contents.

While I appreciate your efforts at posting and seeding this, my bandwidth is too precious to download 1.3 GB of a completely opaque RAR file.  I already have a huge e-book collection, so why waste bandwidth when I might already have most of these books but have no way to know that from your post?  

If you are unwilling to change from using a RAR file, then at a minimum you could create a separate text listing of the RAR contents and post that side-by-side with the archive so we could download that alone first."
,my10r,2012-09-14T19:21Z,"i,l take your word 4 it. thanks "
,juggys69,2012-09-15T05:48Z," I did put down that this is strictly a fantasy/Sci Library in the original title, I do not know why PB changed the name on me to ""Books Collection rar."" ( which is the file name, but I added the feild change title if different from file ), Here is a brief summary, Star Wars complete wookiopeedia timeline besides the short stories from insider and such, just the novel's, and the young adult novel series as well, over 400 books alone there, Battletech complete, Dragonlance, 80% complete ( you won't find a more complete collection online anywhere ), Forgotten realms complete, Starcraft complete, a couple of other multi author series as well can't think of them all atm, Salvatore, R.A. his complete work's ( I did not add these to the FR section besides the legend of drizzt and the war of the spider queen because he has to much on his own ), McCaffery complete works, those, Farland David Runelords complete to date, Martin R.R., complete to date, + around 80 + other author's, mostly thier complete work's, if they wandered into a side field besides Sci-Fi/Fantasy I generally did not add their other work's unless it was a really exceptional work, I did this to help people out because generally book collection's are very very very chaotic with no sense of order, for the next 3 part's ( I have decided to do it in 4 part's, all 2,000-2,500 books each instead of one massive 8,00 book file next ) I will add a directory, it is a one click option I really  didn't want to do, because doing it as a rar. file is just simpler to store, but next time there will be a directory ( directory's annoy me when there are this many book's, unchecking so many little boxes ), this is only part 1 as stated, and I may be a little proud of it, but I do really think it is already the best, most complete, and very, very well organized Sci-Fi / Fantasy Library you will find out there, my final goal is to have 10,000 book's id I can find that many of this gendre worthy of being added, anyway's, as stated before, enjoy, did this for the ones that will appreciate it, the hater's can hate away~~"
,juggys69,2012-09-15T06:01Z," TY to ericb2038, that's pretty much what I am saying, anyone that actually has DLed it know's the amount of work I already put into this, literally hour's upon hour's, and 100% confident anyone that is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan will be extremely happy with the download, the work speaks for itself, also still trolling for suggestion's/request's on author's to add into the next 3 installment's."
,Baelraath,2012-09-18T11:50Z,"I literally registered just so i could comment on this.
THANK YOU!
You absolutely have no idea how happy you made me when i found this torrent. the library is concise and sorted, it's amazing. great job and thnx for the effort. 
Can't wait for the other parts. 
If there are any books you're missing, post them, i'm sure people will try to help you with your effort.
thnx again"
,ericb2038,2012-09-22T14:53Z,"@jugggsy69 : a very simple way of making a directory into a text file : open a cmd window, go to the directory where your book collection
(cd ""/path/to/name of directory/book Collection 2/"")

and type :
dir /b/s >Table-of-content.txt

et voilĂ  a formated list off all epubs in current and subdirectories :)

another maybe simpler way for those not command line savvy is to make use of a simple program : Jdirprint
at http://www.spadixbd.com/freetools/jdirprint.htm

No boxes to untick, it's a rough print of the directories list. Edit, do a search and replace of c:usersyour usernamedocuments"" with nothing in case you don't want to share your computer info with the rest of the worlds and here you go, a simple lits, made in less than a minute :)

Here's the list I produced (with a bit of edit:) ) : http://2038.net/juggsy69-books-collection_table-of-content.txt"
,juggys69,2012-09-23T23:01Z," I know how to make a directory, can do it as a one click option through Winrar as well, also can have Calibre make one, then copy the text ibto microsoft word and hit save field, like I said will include a directory with the next 3 installment's, installment 2 is around a week away from being ready btw, for those that have been waiting, it will have 2,800 book's, last 2 installments will be 2,500 books each tomake the final total 10,000 ;)"
,juggys69,2012-09-26T05:05Z," ericb, hey, I am having a little trouble actually posting the list, i made it, then planned on ULing it to image shack, so could you do me a solid and post the list you made for this one under this one, and check out part 2, which is now up and do the same for those that ""need"" a list ? Huge TY if you can do ;)"
,Snowmyst,2012-09-26T15:23Z,thanks for putting all the work into it
