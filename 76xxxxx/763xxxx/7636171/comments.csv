,Vikingman1111,2012-09-15T05:26Z,"Along with the moron who put together an anti muslim flic that blew up the Middle East, this lyndon larouch crackpot bunch has been doing this crazy stuff for years. LaRouch spent quite a bit of time in federal prison for tax evasion, and has been pissed off ever since. He lives in a Virginia mansion funded by fellow crackpots who give him money to pursue, you guessed it, nut stuff like ""Impeach Obama."" Along with Ayn Rand lookalike crazies such Denoush Dsouza with his psychotic anti Obama ""2016"" film, the right wing can't get over the notion that they have no sense of humor nor can they make movies that people want to see. But they do love the sound of their own words. Be warned."
