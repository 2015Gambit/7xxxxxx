This is the full version of Nonpoint's second album Statement, I know all of you who looked this up were probably pissed off because, (No disrespect to Rockbox, He makes great torrents but), Orgullo cuts off at 1:47, And the song goes for 4:23, Not to worry anymore, I somehow found the full version, but its a secret how I got it ;), All the tracks are In order, and don't exchange to an unknown album or misplacement, I've checked, It's all good, It features a picture you can drag from your picture folder, or just the tab pictures and drop it into the add artwork here box, this is actually the only torrent of this album, that is in order, has every song, and includes a picture, so I would greatly apprechiate a seed on it, Its pretty rare, thanks for downloading
