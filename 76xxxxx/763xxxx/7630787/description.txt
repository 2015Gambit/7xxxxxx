Geometrical Constructions Using Compasses Only by A. N. Kostovskii.
(Little Mathematics Library | Popular Lectures in Mathematics)

The author of the present article has on many occasions given lectures on the theory of geometrical constructions to participants in mathematical olympiads, which have been organized every year since 1947, for the pupils of secondary schools in the city of Lvov. These lectures served as a foundation for the writing of the first part of this work.

The second part consists of investigations made by the author in connection with geometrical constructions carried out with a limited opening of the 'legs'.
The present article is written for a wide circle of readers. It should help teachers and pupils of senior classes of secondary schools to acquaint themselves in greater detail with geometrical constructions carried out with the help of compasses alone. This work can serve as a teaching aid in the work of school mathematical clubs. It can also be used by students studying elementary mathematics in physics and mathematics departments of teachers' training colleges and universities.

The book was translated from the Russian by Janna Suslovich and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1986 (77 pp). This book was also part of the Popular Lectures in Mathematics Series (Vol. 4), which was published by Blaisdell in 1961. This edition was translated from the Russian by Halina Moss and was edited by I. N. Sneddon. The link below is for the PLM (1961) edition, we still need to get LML version.
