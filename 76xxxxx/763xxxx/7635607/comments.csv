,OmniusPrime,2012-09-14T20:33Z,"well, when it's taken with a supertelephoto lens, printed in a newspaper/magazine, then scanned, you really can't expect too much ..."
,Hanovrize,2012-09-14T23:34Z,These are filthy and should we be surprised by this scandal? I have never seen such pornography ...
,geoffp,2012-09-15T02:43Z,"Obviously she was getting changed, not sun bathing as reported. The photographer should be locked up and the paper closed down. "
,shdwolf1,2012-09-15T15:38Z,"gotta love calls for censorship, and repression of freedom of speech, on a borderline illegal download site devoted to stopping censorship...too funny."

,leopinheiro,2012-09-17T21:50Z,only 3 shity photos
,hhavok,2012-09-18T06:04Z,"What about the photos published by Chi magazine? It's said she's not only topless but completely nude.
And who gives a damn if she's married to a princess, they don't deserve special treatment.
Give naked pictures, now!"
,MitchAllen,2012-09-18T06:25Z,Who is Kate Middleton? OH well. Seen one woman topless you seen them all.
,iPlunder,2012-09-19T14:27Z,"That's an asinine statement, MitchAllen:
And I suppose once you've seen one car you've seen them all? Yeah, a VW Beetle and a Bugatti Veyron are virtually identical, so there's no need to look at the Bugatti once you've seen a Beetle, right?

Funny that you found your way to a torrent for topless photos, so I guess you've never seen a topless woman before, because if you had you wouldn't be looking for another one would you?
And if you really don't know who Kate Middleton is, you're unbelievably clueless and need to stop spending all your time watching Beavis and Butthead and start paying attention to world events!


As Ron White said, ""you've seen one woman nekkid, you wanna see the rest of 'em nekkid.""

Truer words were never spoken."
,cyberplayer2000,2012-09-19T14:56Z,"OMG how the children
My God, she's just a woman!
So you should give her privacy even I find ..."

If you are detecting viruses in JPG files, then you need either much better anti-virus software, or a new brain."
