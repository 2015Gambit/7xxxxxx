Author's Preface:

"Music is the supreme power, which can move the hearts and minds of men. Music is my Dharam and I worship its soul.

The flute and shankh (conch) are both gifts of God, and both require sustained breath to evoke the beauty of their utterance. To bring out the essence of the music, I must breathe from deep within me into the flute. When my breath meets the sound of the flute, and the two become one, I feel the sublime force of God and of music..."
