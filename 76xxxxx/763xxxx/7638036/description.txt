Orangutan Diary: Season 1
From the makers of Big Cat Week and Elephant Diaries comes this candid view of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation and its efforts to create a safe haven for this incredible yet endangered species. Prepare for a rollercoaster ride of emotions following the life-and-death struggle to save irresistibly cute orang-utan orphans at the Orang Jungle Hospital in the middle of Borneo. The presenters and crew spend a moving, inspiring and involving week in the heart of the biggest orang-utan rehabilitation centre, providing a uniquely intimate and engaging look at the most entertaining of the great apes, in one of the remotest corners of the world. They witness both success and failure as orang-utans are helped to take the tentative first steps back into an independent life in the wild, and join dangerous rescue missions as anti-poaching patrols follow up tip-offs to track down orphaned babies intended for the cruel pet trade.




3)  Part 3 
There is tragedy at the rescue centre when a newly arrived baby fights for its life. Michaela hopes for the best and is encouraged when her favourite orphan Lomon finally starts to make some progress. Steve helps out at the place where young orangutans like Grendon and Ellie learn the skills that will equip them for a life in the wild.
