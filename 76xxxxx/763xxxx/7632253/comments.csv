,beljici,2012-09-13T19:13Z,Thank u so much!!!!
,beljici,2012-09-13T19:28Z,"Yes, it is slow upload speed, but first who download it and continue to seed, than it will be much more faster. Sorry for that little thing."
,beljici,2012-09-13T19:56Z,"tomorrow will seeded on academic on T3, so the uploud speed will be around 1 MB/s

Please, write comments about everything :)"

[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-13T21:16Z,"WHEN HAS AN ANONYMOUS UPLOADER  E V E R  HAD A BRIP OUT BEFORE A SKULL , ERM  LET ME THINK , OH THAT'S RIGHT  N E V E R . 

I DON'T KNOW WHO DESERVES TO BE BITCH SLAPPED MORE  - THE UPLOADER OF SAID FAKE OR ALL THE IDIOTS THAT STILL DON'T KNOW TO WAIT TILL A SKULL HAS BROUGHT IT OUT . 

AND THIS IS WHY THESE FAKERS  N E V E R GIVE UP , THEY ONLY RELY ON 1% TO BE IDIOTS . "
,BloodKil_,2012-09-13T22:45Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name 

Comments like that make you out to be the stupid one as there has been a great many times that someone without a skull has beaten out those with it for release times..

That is not to say of course this is one such of those, nor that more often than not you are getting fake/infected when you go that route.  That said dont be a tard about it.

O yeah...  Learn to CAPS LOCK"
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-13T23:02Z,"NAH MATE I'M NOT THE STUPID ONE , CAN YOU GIVE ME 1 OR 2  INSTANCES ON TPB WHERE YOU HAVE SEEN THESE UPLOADS BEFORE A SKULL AND I COULD GUARANTEE IF THERE ARE ANY CASES THERE WOULD BE AN UPLOAD FROM A SKULL WITHIN MINUTES . 

I USE CAPS TO MAKE THE STATEMENTS STAND OUT , I'M NOT BRAINWASHED INTO BELIEVING NONSENSE ABOUT SHOUTING WITH CAPS .

AND WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY , OH A NOBODY , IS THAT WHY YOU FELT LIKE COMMENTING , TRYING TO DEFEND THE LITTLE GUYS WHO DONT CONTRIBUTE .

YOU WILL EARN MY RESPECT WHEN YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING , TALK IS CHEAP .

AND I'M ONLY TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE TO STOP DOWNLOADING FROM DODGY SOURCES AND WAIT ON A SKULL TO HAVE IT , IT MAKES SENSE . 

BUT YOU COME ON HERE TRYING TO BE A SMART ARSE AND FAILING MISERABLY .

OH YEAH , LEARN TO CAPS LOCK YOURSELF .

NOW OFF YOU FUCK BEFORE I RAISE MY CANE TO YOU ."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-13T23:17Z,"ONE MORE THING , I'M NOT SAYING ALL THIS CAUSE I HAVE A SKULL , I'M SAYING IT CAUSE IN THE LONG RUN IF EVERYONE WAITED ON A SKULL TO UPLOAD THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE FAKES , AND HOPEFULLY THESE FAKERS WOULD JUST GIVE UP . 

SO IF MY CAPS ANNOY YOU , TOUGH SHIT , BUT IF IT MAKES A FEW MORE PEOPLE THINK BEFORE THEY DOWNLOAD THAT'S WHAT COUNTS . "
,beljici,2012-09-13T23:25Z,"OK. So u don't believe the stranger and I get that.

Look about these samples from the movie, and than think again.

I am anonymous for a thousands reasons..

The movie is REAL!!!

Please, after downloading this movie and see his state, please remove bad comments. Thank you.

Video: 10
Audio: 10

Love you too :)"
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-13T23:59Z,"@ beljici , IF THIS IS A BRIP OF PROMETHEUS I WILL SAY SORRY . 

SAYING THE MOVIE IS REAL DOESNT MAKE IT A BRIP . AND IF I'M RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL THE GOOD COMMENTS REMOVED . 

PS   LOVE YOU MORE ."
,BloodKil_,2012-09-14T00:00Z,"@retard-who-use-caps

And you further humiliate yourself...   If I was new here and read your bs I would never dl from a skull nor probably come back.

Speaking of cane, you must have been hit by one as a child.  Your usage of caps only makes you stand out as an idiot, and the words written in your caps lock state make it seem like you got your VIP skull from the make a wish foundation.  

O and by your logic if everyone waited for members with a skull there would only be a couple peeps with skulls dumbass, 

Learn to logic"
,beljici,2012-09-14T00:17Z,"PROOF

[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-14T00:38Z,"@ BloodKil  , you are still a nobody , there in small letters just for you , so it doesnt hurt your eyes .

YOUR  logic makes no sense , why would there not be many skulls . lol  that is the most retarded thing you have came out with .

there are thousands on TPB with skulls , and by the way there are loads of people who have not got skulls but have uploaded hundreds of things too , they can also be trusted , it's the people who come on anonymous with no way of checking what they have uploaded you can't trust . 

Always bringing up my caps is your only way to deflect from the core truth of what i'm saying , and youre too dumb to see it .

Even if i'm wrong on this occasion , and I said I would SAY SORRY TO THE UPLOADER IF IT'S PROVED TO BE A BRIP , I would still recommend to everyone to wait on a skull or someone at the very least has had multiple uploads over a period of weeks or months to get it from . And if none of that makes sense to you I don't think I could have put it any simpler for you ."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-14T00:50Z,"@ beljici , And very nice screens they are too . they look great quality . 

And this proves they are from a BRIP how ?
This could be a very good dvdrip for all I know .
And as I said before , If people other than you verify this is indeed a BRIP , I will hold my hands up and say sorry . I can't say fairer than that .
And it will be the first time Ive seen someone anonymous to have uploaded a BRIP of a new release before anyone else . And for that I will tip my hat to you .   "
,gozinya,2012-09-14T00:51Z,"Downloading now, definitely not a fake...it's the legit movie. Not sure about the quality yet...please stand by."
,beljici,2012-09-14T01:04Z,"I can't understand some of u guys.
What will i get good of uploading something bad or wrong-nothing!
I am new as uploader and i h*a*ed this Brip and really enjoed the movie so i decided to share whit all of u who kinky waited for this bluerayrip quality, as i am.

If u don't like to waiting to complete download or u think it is bad or something like that-knock yourself up to just do the next page or enything what your hart said, no bad feeling for both side.

And others who will complete their dows, will comment me positivly.

Thats all about this story.

Good night fellasssss."
,thornado86,2012-09-14T01:21Z,"I'm no expert, but from the pieces I've downloades this far, it doesn't look like BR, at least not from 1080 source, maybe it's 720, but It also could be dvd. No offence or anything. And I maybe I'm totally wrong. 

Anyway, this is a screen from what I've got. Doesn't look too sharp, does it? idk.

,Ajube0476,2012-09-14T02:53Z,"It is NOT a BRRIP.. this is an upscaled dvdrip at best.
Wait for a REAL BRRIP.. this is not even close."
,Houdinica,2012-09-14T03:29Z,"Please keep comments directed at Audio/Video Quality . Arguing should be saved for a forum .

Thanks to all "
,Ajube0476,2012-09-14T06:40Z,"It is not a brrip as title is labeled.
A/V quality is irrelevant.. there is  plenty of upscaled dvdrips like this one available already."
,beljici,2012-09-14T10:15Z,"This is 1920 Ă&#x2014; 1080 and it's about 8gb, when i converted it is 1024 x 748 and about 3gb.

It must be a little lower q than original movie.
Sorry for that, i just want good to do to share whit u all.
---------------------
Now, the movie is placed hiden in some pc-s at the university and up speed is very good. I hope that no one will find it.

Peace :)"
,setup4u,2012-09-14T12:47Z,"I just watch sreens from this movie and they are more then ok.
So these bad comments must be given without seeing this movie at all... To give bad reviews with out even checking the movie, is most stupid thing to do.
And don't even try to ''bark'' back...."
,beljici,2012-09-14T15:22Z,My mistake is that I am not make some Sample movie of 4-5min.
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-14T16:15Z,"@ setup4u , you are totally missing the point . it doesnt matter if it's really good quality . what matters is what's claimed . 
The uploader claimed this is brip , and a few people totally disagree and I too disagree . 

And my reasons are simple , no one else has a brip of this . and there is a simple explanation for this to , It isnt out on blu-ray yet , ANYWHERE .

However I do believe that the uploader has made an honest mistake as he seems genuine enough .

There  , I didnt bark ."
,Fittler,2012-09-14T19:05Z,So is this the extended cut? 
,Fittler,2012-09-14T19:17Z,Is this the extended edition? 
,gozinya,2012-09-14T19:24Z,"This is 1280x720 and is visibly superior quality over DVD, which could only come from a BR original...just as the uploader stated. Thanks uploader!"
,beljici,2012-09-14T19:27Z,"Ohh @gozinya thank you!

I hope the download speed was good?

PLEASE SEED

And rate me with +
:)"
,gozinya,2012-09-14T19:31Z,"Not extended, same length as DVD."
,Fittler,2012-09-14T19:34Z,"Yeah, the blueray was suppoused to be totally uncut, and if this one is than AWESOME!!!!!"
,Fittler,2012-09-14T19:36Z,Than it is not the blueray version since that one is suppoused to have 25 mins extra. 
,gozinya,2012-09-14T19:39Z,Extended footage is being added as deleted scenes on Blu-ray release.
,Fittler,2012-09-14T20:06Z,"Oh, ok why hasnt anyone uploaded them from the DVD release, or from this BR release? "
,Fittler,2012-09-14T20:19Z,"Downloaded it, and no this is not a br rip but a somewhat upscaled DVDrip. "
,gozinya,2012-09-14T20:27Z,"I have personally upgraded the DVDrip and have watched both that version and this one on my 67"" HDTV, and believe me the difference is obvious. "
,Scrotom,2012-09-14T20:57Z,"gozinya, take the uploaders dick out of your mouth. This is an upscaled DVD rip and not true 720p BlueRay. Shut your whore mouth. I'm waiting for a real BR rip. Besides, Anon uploaders should be steered clear of since they don't have the balls to provide what they advertise."
,Fittler,2012-09-14T21:21Z,"no its not abrrip, s an upscaled dvdrip."
,Ajube0476,2012-09-14T21:58Z,"gozinya you're a fool if you believe this to be a brrip.
And so is the uploader.. maybe he honestly thinks this is a brrip.. or maybe he knows it isn't and is lying. 
Doesn't matter.. either way he is ..WRONG."
,gozinya,2012-09-14T22:05Z,"God, stupid people really piss me off. Especially big-mouthed stupid people. I say what it is, and I know the fucking difference...period. I am watching it right now in 67 glorious horizontal inches, and upscaling cannot do what I am watching. I've done it a million times, I should know, dickwad."
,gozinya,2012-09-14T22:08Z,"and yeah, I know it's diagonal."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-15T00:23Z,"@ gozinya , listen mate , this could be the best copy of the movie out just now , but it's NOT a brrip . 
ANY MOVIE THAT'S JUST OUT , THERE ARE ABOUT 10 SKULLS THAT UPLOAD THE MOVIE WITHIN MINUTES OF EACH OTHER . DO YOU SEE ANYBODY ELSE WITH A BBRIP . NO YOU DON'T .

LOOK ONLINE , I THINK THE EARLIEST DATE FOR RELEASE WAS 7TH OCTOBER , AND A DIGITAL DOWNLOAD ON 17TH SEPTEMBER .

NO ONE HAS GOT IT , BECAUSE IT'S NOT OUT ON BLU-RAY YET ."
,gozinya,2012-09-15T00:44Z,"@ Steevo, hey I hear ya...but:
A)The guy says it's on a pc at his university, and that he downgraded the 8gig file to just over 3 gigs accounting for the iffy BR quality. There's a first time for everything.
B)The DVD isn't released yet, either, but everyone's got it.
C)I'm watching this on a 67"" TV, flaws become easy to notice. I've seen a bunch of DVD>720p rips including my own and none look close to this. No pixelation, edges are sharp and clean, no grain, flames and explosions have that ""healthy glow"". If it's an upscaled DVDrip I'd like to know his magic trick."
,Ajube0476,2012-09-15T00:44Z,gozinya you are the big mouthed fool here.. it's pathetic. You don't know wtf you are talking about .. torrent noob.
,gozinya,2012-09-15T00:55Z,Whatever. I'm just trying to give a guy credit where it appears to be due.
,thornado86,2012-09-15T01:40Z,"I've just downloaded it, and even tho' gozinya thinks the quality is good, even ""br-good"", it's really not. This movie miss the sharp quality of a BR, even the BR-rips that are compressed to 1gig are sharper. Sorry to say it, but it's not bluray, and if it really was a BR, I'd like to know the magic he pulled off to make it this bad. No offence, its still a good upload, but you've done a honest mistake, pal :)

Also, I'd like to confirm what steevo-be-thy-name is saying: The skull-people always manage to upload BR-movies the same day they're out."
,thornado86,2012-09-15T01:45Z,"And also if it was bluray, you should upload the whole thing."
,thornado86,2012-09-15T01:50Z,And don't forget sample next time :P hehe :)
,gozinya,2012-09-15T01:57Z,"Ok, forgive me if I've been in error, but I've seen ""confirmed"" Blu-rays that looked worse. I appreciate the guys upload nonetheless."
,beljici,2012-09-15T02:13Z,"Ok, look, i found it and uploud it.

Why is only 3.3gb because i don't have very good up speed, only 50-60KB/s.

Some of u i can't really understand. What u know is only to think that ""some guy"" is stupid and have no clue about anything.

Now, i sorry myself for sharing this with u."
,Scrotom,2012-09-15T03:32Z,awwww wait come back goziya now I feel bad... we're just givin you a hard time. You conceded too early!!
,gozinya,2012-09-15T04:08Z,"I took another look at this and realized that I very well may be mistaken. I'm not trying to be adamant about ""my point"" here, the rip simply looked better to me than all the other upscaled DVDrips, so I felt the uploader was being honest and didn't deserve all the bashing. That's all."
,tpbswrnkr,2012-09-15T12:00Z,"I can assure its not as good as even a nice 4-5 GB BRrip.
It may be a BRrip but then the person who did the muxing must have been an amateur.

I've seen nice original 50GB Blu-Rays to a 4.37GB rips, but none of them has ever been like this.

Even the brrip of oldies as its a wonderful life are much better.."
,you_die,2012-09-15T14:04Z,"It''s definitely an upscale with crappy quality, don't download it."
,piglet44,2012-09-16T18:46Z,It wasnt that bad a rip at the time I dl'd it but I was watching on a netbook not a 1080p screen. There are better ones now though if you are picky about it
,schnitzelburger,2012-09-17T19:45Z,This torrent is under fierce surveillance of the MPAA. They put it on TPB as a honeypot.
