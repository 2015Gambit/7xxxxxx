Walter Silva , the same DJ who had been instrumental in consolidating João Gilberto ’s career in 1958 was a show promoter then and decided to pair off Elis Regina with Jair Rodrigues . Silva planned three shows at huge Paramount Theatre with accompaniment by Jongo Trio [piano, double-bass and drums] that was an instant sell out. From these shows Walter Silva produced a 'live' album called ' Dois na Bossa ' [ Two at Bossa ] whose main track was a seven-minute-long samba meddley that would play on the radio incessantly. Elis & Jair ruled the air-waves. This was 'album of the year'. I would say it was album of the decade. Soon after that Elis was invited to compere ' O Fino da Bossa ' a weekly TV show that was the best thing one could possibly think of. The best musicians in the country would play there and it became the base for future TV musicals and future 'music festivals' that would stir the whole country many times in the next few years. Elis went from strength to strength soon to become the biggest female singer in Brazil's history.
