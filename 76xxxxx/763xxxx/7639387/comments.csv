,h903999,2012-09-15T20:45Z,"Thank you to uploader for effort,

But A/V:
really nice quality video:  8-9,, needs color saturation fixed
Audio:  complete CRAP, buzzing, sounds like bees,

I'm sure someone who knows how, will fix the Video up,
and replace this bad audio, "
[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-15T21:10Z,Yes - this is in English - I'm sure a better audio version will pop up at some point.
,bi-seven,2012-09-15T21:38Z,Another China version ... keep waiting ...
,Revisionist,2012-09-16T02:38Z,Ok... why would anyone how wants a hi res movie want cam audio. Yeah I want to see the movie on my 52 inch screen and have craptacular sound blaring thru the 5.1..  Why do people even bother uploading trash files like this.
,brendo976,2012-09-16T12:00Z,"Dont bother with this. picture is good, sound is shit, n vlc tells me the file is broken. plus its missing the end of the film."
,s1nt3k,2012-09-16T16:45Z,"Uploader this is just a suggestion. I think you should take the dash - out of the name Spider-man and change it to one word Spiderman. All the other Spidey torrents are named Spiderman and I don't think to many people know that this one is here because it doesn't show on a search because of that reason.

I think then someone who has line audio may find this one and be able to sync it to this one. This is one has the best video quality thus far. Thanks uploader!

[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-16T16:55Z,"Better audio version is here guys .....

Click on my latest upload and you're there :)"
,frailwordscollapse,2012-09-16T21:55Z,If the audio is bad then just sync the video up with the audio of a different version. For a cam rip this looks pretty damn good.
