Thanks for the uploads of Crumb anyway!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-14T18:53Z,"You're most welcome sonans. Unfortunately, no, this is all for now. I actually explained it at the end of the description for this torrent (although it should say 'these', not 'those'). 

I have Vol 16, but it's missing about 25 pages at the end of the book. And I had Vol 9, but I can't seem to locate it. At this point I'm pretty sure it received an accidental deletion. 

I'll keep checking around for them from time to time, though. I'm sure I'll up more in the future."
