Description: i recorded the full Mass Effect 2 video game and made it into a movie. there is no game-play only the story. i made decisions in the game that will give the viewer the most story possible. i watched it today and it came out seamless and the viewer will not be lose at any point in the story. the Mass Effect story is very complex and any sci fi fan will enjoy this. i made this for people who don't like video games but are interested in the Mass Effect story. i hope everyone enjoys it

P.S. 8.13 GB was the smallest i could get it to. the original file was 60GB
