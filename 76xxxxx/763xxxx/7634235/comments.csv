I hope that you have the time and motivation to do the third installment as well.

And i also really would beg for a 720p or even 1080p version.

But since you wrote that the original was 60gigs 0_o

Well i don't know how you recorded and converted it, but it seems like an aweful lot of work.

This on is 480p, is it not? How much would 720 and 1080 be... xDD"
