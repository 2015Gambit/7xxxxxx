Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, September 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with former Minnesota governor, Navy Seal, and television show host Jesse Ventura about the political landscape in America following the Republican and Democrat conventions. Jesse is the author of DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs In Government, a book that exposes the ineptitude and gang-like mentalities of both parties.

Alex covers the news and also the latest on the al-Qaeda attack on the U.S. embassy in Libya, a country reduced to failed state status by Obama and NATO.

Note: Although not mentioned in the official show description, Steve Shenk (president of eFoodsDirect, a show sponsor) is Alex's guest for approximately the last two-thirds of hour 3.
