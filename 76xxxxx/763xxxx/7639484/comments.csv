,Magnus314,2012-09-26T00:02Z,"It suddenly stopped working for me after finnishing the level ""Blast Pit"".

It crashes to the desktop with a log on the error including "" Fault Module Name:	steamclient.dll"".

So it seems like the ""crack"" with not needing steam suddenly isn't working, since it is trying to access the steamclient, which isn't there.
This happens after about 15-20 seconds regardless what i do, even if just starting up black mesa and doing nothing."
,Magnus314,2012-09-26T12:38Z,"Never mind my last comment about it not working.
After another restart of the pc it suddenly works (last time it didn't despite doing a restart).
Strange, but all things seems to be good again!"
