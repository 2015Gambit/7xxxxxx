Issues 1-9 of 'Art? Alternatives'

This is something WAAAAY out on the edge of having to do with Robert Crumb, particularly since most of his pages in issue two were included in one of the 'Complete Crumb' volumes. It's also certainly not a 'comic book', but many of the issues do contain artwork and interviews with the people from the underground, alternative and outsider comic book worlds. Anyway, I thought it might be an interesting break and something a little different for those who have been downloading all the Crumb stuff.
