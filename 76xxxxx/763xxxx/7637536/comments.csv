[V],psspss,2012-09-17T06:49Z,"Season 1 here

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6830097/Great_British_Ghosts_(2011)_Series_xvid_avi


S02E01 was amazing.. some great photos and locations better then S01 I think"
,ZaCbAgAnS,2012-09-17T17:21Z,"back to your old tricks again. if you want to waste your bandwidth converting x264 stuff to shitty xvid then feel free but at least have some respect and credit the original uploader. also, its more that a 8 part series... well.. i guess that's if i bother to share more than 8. choice is yours."
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T03:19Z,"WTF

am in not stopping the cappers of sources
uploading to p2p but they never do 

so they can get bragging rights..


no one cares who capped it anyhow

its all bs.. and TPB dont care either

they delete nobs hassling here so be careful"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T03:23Z,"and if people kept to xvids and not do tv shows in 720 and mp4s then the media coys would be less attacking of torrent sites as they less likely care about taking down sites with xvids

and I check the guides and it had 8 listed

and its funny how so many want xvids still

just as well we dont live by your rules

so I take it you the uk ripper of these then
so why arent you uploading them here :)"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T03:24Z,"and I have to upload and share these as no one else bothered to on p2p

so someone has to share their expensive data"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T03:28Z,"one last thing.. atleast I bother to look up titles and airdates and include in the name

so many rippers are lazy fooks"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T03:50Z,"

werent you called JosHgAtes and got deleted here already with the same slanging comments month ago?
"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-18T09:02Z,"dude, you must love seeing your own comments just as if you enjoy hearing yourself talk.

psspss... 
1) uploading this with NO credit to where or who you got it from when you know damn well is a pretty big dickhole of a move.

2) pirating sharing caring bragging rights whatever yea yea bla bla go bang yourself with some bullhorns. it's called etiquette and you hardly ever use it. 

3) TPB won't ban people for calling you out so you can stop trying to throw up that nonsense. besides, you talk your fair share of shit, so you should watch your own words.

4) you're a bloody idiot thinking x264 and 720p versions are the cause of recent MPAA actions.  XviD can do just as good of quality as x264, it just takes more bitrate to achieve so. here, let me kick your ass a little more with some additional education. your precious xvid is formally known as h.263, my precious x264 is also known as h.264.  two branches of the same tree... so again, bounce your beefy bum on them bullhorns, you dolt.

5) your file names are horrendous and i'm willing to bet my families life that at least 95% of those who get from you rename it to their own preference.

6) the titles and air dates with episode briefings were in the .nfo files that came with the original downloads you snagged from the blog. hah, you said you looked up the info, whatever, gut instinct tells me that you looked at the guys .nfo files. you're a jackass for saying the guy that ripped these was lazy.  making an .nfo file takes much more time than making some over-extended file name.

i tried being cool with you but it doesn't seem to work for more than a couple weeks. you're just a jerkoff jackass dickhole to work with. all you had to do was put reference where you got it from and include the tag name of who ripped it. you don't seem to respect others who do the real work so we shall not respect you."
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-18T09:44Z,"oooo, i just can't resist. you go on n on about some bullshit so i want to go on n on about some more bullshit.

... it's hilarious how you think xvid is still superior when download numbers show that at least 3 to 1 people prefer x264 now. maybe even 10 to 1 on more popular shows. margin allowed for people who don't care or still have xvid dvd player and can convert for themselves.

... you know what xvid is like for you and some others? it's like that really old family dog you've had for 15 years and it's dying but you just can't let it go. it's just there. it doesn't do anything spectacular anymore. it can't learn any new tricks. for the love of all that is holy and correct put the dying old dog out of its misery!

... there are numerous solutions to adjust to x264.  free if you want to convert for yourself. if d!psh!ts like psspss can do it and you people call it golden, then screw me, anybody can do it!

or there's the very inexpensive way for ""new gear"". less than $50 USD! yea that's the same price as that POS old gear from 10 years ago.

... lasty (for now), the original files have been shared on other sites. the world doesn't revolve around torrents. i'm sure more people got it from the other sites than there are seeds here. we don't live by YOUR rules, either. you're smug, arrogant, cocky, pompous, egotistical, self-righteous, delusional, misinformed, and a piss poor encoder. i mean, c'mon, you've been doing this for 2 years and no improvement? weak. i pray nobody else lives by your rules.

this is not spam. this is not slander. to the best of my knowledge this is all true. this is all factual speaking based on experiences dealing with that guy there."
,ZaCbAgAnS,2012-09-18T10:22Z,"lol, lazy. the amount of hours I've spent learning how to cap, encode, cut etc to get a good encode is just crazy. also if you bothered to read the nfo you would notice much more info in there compared to your AMAZING way of naming files.

also, if you read the nfos you would notice ep to had some errors in it with some missing footage so congrats on misleading your followers.

all I'm saying is put Source: [FILENAME] in the description instead of living off others hard work. its that simple."
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T10:36Z,"its easier to post smaller comments then big ones all the time espc since tpb seems to ban comments weirdly and not let you post and it seems to happen more when doing bigger comments here

you get the said DB error message

if thats TNE again.. we have been down this road to many times already..

about my naming format and coding etc..

thats if its you and not someone using your acct here.. either way

move on"
[V],psspss,2012-09-18T10:52Z,"if theres missing footage I didnt notice and I dont care

I dont make a living of this either so your using the wrong wording for sure..

i will never use tags.. if i convert stuff tags go
tags =- egos and waste of space in filename

nfos are pointless.. dont need them never will
if the details are in the name

win 7 can search stuff much quicker that way

== last comment on this shit again.. now PO"
,ZaCbAgAnS,2012-09-18T14:08Z,"you want me to piss off, please do the same. leave my encodes alone and I'll happily leave you alone."
,xxdocxx,2012-09-26T00:43Z,am i fucking missing something here. why are you fucking retards always dishing xvid. like and prefer what ever format you want. there's maybe hundreds or even thousands downloading high res tv shows. who fucking cares. go to the top 100 in the movie section and there's millions downloading xvid. most bluray rips are still done in avi. so why are you asshole still dishing avi when some of the top uploaders are still using it.
