,goldpianogarden,2012-09-16T18:19Z,"It is actually one screen/frame from the very start of the movie where it says 'costume designer..Lizzie whoever' and it stays on that frame for the entire movie length. One frame, for 103 minutes.... Nothing else ever shows, just that one picture/frame.  So, FAKE!!!"

such a waste of time!"
,TheShotte,2012-09-24T03:00Z,"Love how all the idiots think it's fake. If you try to play it with VLC, you'll get that one frame for video only, but if you haven't noticed, the sound still plays. 

SOLUTION: PLAY IT WITH WMP DUMBASSES."
,briffault,2012-09-28T09:23Z,"Did try WMP, and VLC, the audio is WAY off, IF it plays at all. Whoever recorded this must be either blind or deaf.....do NOT download!"
,briffault,2012-09-28T09:24Z,"...oh...and TheShotte? Looks like you're the dumbass here, kid."
