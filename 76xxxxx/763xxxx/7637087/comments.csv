I really appreciate all your work in uploading these great k!nk vidz.
I love how you put a preview pic in the p!ratebay window above -So we don't have to click a  spammy pic link to see preview.  Brilliant work. 
Please keep it up!"

The only time we have skipped preview pic(since we started using em) was when bayimg was down. I dont like the ordinary bayimg links either and we use them as little as we can. 

Its better to use each sites own images/previews.

Dont know how many trojans and viruses I have gotten from pic sites over the years, now if I want to see a peeview "
