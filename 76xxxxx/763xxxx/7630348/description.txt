Just the ioQuake3 game engine with key checks removed. For those who don't want to type their cd key in after installing (you have a CD key for your copy of the game, right?)

This + quake3 data files = quake3.

CD keys are easy to get (or find), so This is only for the truly lazy. It works, I've tested it.
