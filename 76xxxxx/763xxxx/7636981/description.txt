Good evening there
Here is our remastered version of "The Constant Gardener"
A very nice movie for sure,but hard movie anyway.
Source :
mkv remux (mpeg-4 avc h.264)of this BD's movie.
We decided to reconvert it again to m2ts but this time by using mpeg-2 codec and by downgrading original DTS-HD MA and HD HR 5.1 to classic AC3-5.1/6 ch/48 khz at 512 kbps speed.
Result is and stay very good anyway.
Video and Audio quality is very acceptable for a final size of 10 Gb.
Don't expect a perfect quality but you should enjoy it.Hopefully anyway...
US english and French language are only available for this movie with no sub 'cause
sub synchronisation was not very good with our movie,sorry so.
