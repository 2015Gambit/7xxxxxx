,Hedgeyy,2012-09-15T08:06Z,"Thank you Vastor, for a good quality torrent. Will seed, much better than sinnera's rubbish attempts."
,sinnera,2012-09-15T08:33Z,"LoL hedgeyy. Stop trash talking me.

How are my attempts ""Rubbish""? I believe Vastor and I have the same quality torrent. Except I include the Album Mix. That's the only difference.
