Native Instruments Vintage Heat Expansion for Maschine


VINTAGE HEAT provides a warm and meaty sound character based on samples from 

vintage analog gear combined with creative, modern recording techniques, perfectly 

in tune with contemporary, cutting-edge production standards. All samples were 

lovingly hand crafted by the renowned New Zealand sample guru Goldbaby, and 

consist of 51 kits including drum and percussion samples as well as multi-sampled 

melodic synth sounds and dedicated pre-programmed patterns for each kit.


The basic installation add 7 to the project, and sound samples etc.
