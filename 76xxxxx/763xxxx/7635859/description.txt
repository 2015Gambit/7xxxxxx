   V.A. - Philadelphia International Records: The 40th Anniversary Box Set [10 CDs] (2012)
   The 40th Anniversary Box Set the most complete and comprehensive study of the Philadelphia International catalogue to date. This time Ralph Tee (Ralph is also author of the definitive Who's Who In Soul Music) has the added benefit of a further 25 years of experience studying the Philadelphia International operation and a lot more time to play with almost 800 minutes or over 12 1/2 hours of pure quality music from one of the greatest labels of all time. 

   An absolute must for all Philly collectors and especially Philadelphia International archivists as there has never been an officially printed full discography before.

   All recordings - fully re-mastered to the highest quality.
