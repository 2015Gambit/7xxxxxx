Set in 1952, as England prepares for the coronation, The Scapegoat tells the story of two very different men who have one thing in common - a face.

Directed by Charles Sturridge. Starring Sheridan Smith, Andrew Scott. 

NOTE: Recommended. Absolute delight to watch. Aired last week  on ITV (UK).
