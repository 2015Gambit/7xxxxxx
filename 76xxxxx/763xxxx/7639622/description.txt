Grave.of.the.Fireflies.studio.Ghibli1988.720p.BluRay.x264
 
As the Empire of the Sun crumbles upon itself and a rain of firebombs
falls upon Japan, the final death march of a nation is echoed in 
millions of smaller tragedies. This is the story of Seita and his 
younger sister Setsuko, two children born at the wrong time, in the 
wrong place, and now cast adrift in a world that lacks not the care 
to shelter them, but simply the resources. Forced to fend for themselves
in the aftermath of fires that swept entire cities from the face of the
earth, their doomed struggle is both a tribute to the human spirit and
the stuff of nightmares. Beautiful, yet at times brutal and horrifying.
