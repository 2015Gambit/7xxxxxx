Yukio Mishima's Classic is brought to life by Kris Kristofferson and a youthful cast. The Brits originated the evil-child genre with Village of the Damned (1960), and this continues it. A Plymouth boy has formed a fascist-style youth gang, with gruesome results. Slow and creepy, you have to watch it o the end.
