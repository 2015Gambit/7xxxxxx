,SR4T9US,2012-09-15T21:28Z,"Thanks Hero, can always count on you.. Tried to get this via BM site but all the d-loads times out, and the so-called torrent they had wasn't working.."
,VicVega,2012-09-15T22:42Z,They put a damn swastika and a Burzum song in the installer. Fucking nazis.
,OmniNegro,2012-09-15T22:50Z,"I have a few questions if you do not mind.

1. Does this require the Source Engine SDK 2007 be installed to work? Or does this have it's own copy included?

2. Will this interfere with or use a copy of Steam already installed?

So far, I have installed the game via official channels. I am just looking for a way to reintroduce the game to those playing a no-Steam system.

Thank you in advance."
,OmniNegro,2012-09-16T00:02Z,"I just noticed this claims to include a crack. WTF? There is no need for a crack. It is freeware.

Anyone know about replacing the installer to get rid of the nazi shit? (Presuming that is actually the case as VicVega said.)"
,fishboy11,2012-09-16T01:09Z,needs a crack to bypass steam
,.KRAAG.,2012-09-16T07:07Z,Is this a stand-alone game?
,.KRAAG.,2012-09-16T07:09Z,"It is stand-alone, sweet! thanks."
,TOMKATBG,2012-09-16T13:09Z,whoever made the instaler ONE BIG FUCK U ASSHOLE
,Seubas,2012-09-16T20:23Z,Thank you from all my heart for the one who chose the song during installation
,sapo_joe,2012-09-17T03:09Z,False (?) positive on the installer. Just for your information.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-09-17T04:50Z,Just go to the main site and download it from there. They offer direct download or torrent. Why bother downloading from here.
,ski_zx,2012-09-17T04:55Z,"Works perfectly, Thanks!"
,ski_zx,2012-09-17T04:57Z,"Bandit, it is NO-Steam standalone."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-09-17T18:32Z,"@Ski_zx
And?"
,Panj,2012-09-18T21:28Z,"@Bean-Bandit
and... people who don't want to install steam (and download Source SDK 2007) can install this and play :)"
,miloshsrb,2012-09-18T22:38Z,"Working on w7, fast instal and standalone !"
,Maka91,2012-09-19T20:48Z,"Thanks.

Works great."
