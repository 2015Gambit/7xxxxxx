,impeRia89,2012-09-14T17:57Z,Im going to seed this with my root ;)
,H215,2012-09-14T17:59Z,This is the official version. The Black Mesa team uploaded this to their facebook page. This guy beat me to uploading it to TPB.
,ixilisi,2012-09-14T18:06Z,"If this is the BlackMes.7z file it should have an MD5 of: f1d86575816f4c6994a5657eebf76409

and a SHA1 of: cdbcb20618c416b62e9ef29c209360b6b0eba252

,stacalkas,2012-09-14T18:10Z,"You'll need to install Steam and download, ""Source SDK Base 2007"". It's free!"
,ssadfaf,2012-09-14T18:15Z,It is 3.8Gb on official site
,skiba_,2012-09-14T18:18Z,Can anyone confirm this. The file size is different from their website 3.8GB
,The Real Chicken,2012-09-14T18:21Z,"Maybe not on Steam yet, but it is Greenlit, which means it will be. And it is free to download at http://release.blackmesasource.com/ so I would say that l3viathan2142 is (almost) correct with his info."
,Metalsand,2012-09-14T18:21Z,"Well, it IS the right size...

And I think he means it is run through steam."
,skiba_,2012-09-14T18:24Z,"Weird my comment got deleted....

Can anyone confirm this is real. The file size on their official site is 3.8GB"
,bobbeamer,2012-09-14T18:37Z,Thanks Uploader..  and to those who are kindly seeding this right now.  :)
,BeatlePR,2012-09-14T18:58Z,Download speed 13.4 k/bs fuck this.
,Phencyclidine,2012-09-14T19:16Z,Can anyone tell me whether or not this is a standalone release? Or does it require Half-Life 2 & steam?
,TheAdamWe,2012-09-14T19:34Z,"can confirm that this is legit, if you go on to the Black Mesa site and download the torrent file there you will find that the torrent from there will recognize the files from here."
,isogi,2012-09-14T19:36Z,588 kB/s and growing :)
,Buboon,2012-09-14T19:37Z,"This is legit, added it and it used the files from my official download. However this version has less trackers than the official. "
,ssadfaf,2012-09-14T20:10Z,It is ok - playable
,Sunderlandize,2012-09-14T20:13Z,Now I'm stucked at 3 kb/s =/ I've been at 500 kb/s for an hour and a half !
,RealYoti,2012-09-14T20:21Z,"Torrent recreated, but files are 100% legit."
,czejenesku,2012-09-14T20:28Z,it'snot exactly free - you need to download source SDK which is only for free if you own any legit copy of SOURCE Engine game.
,draske73,2012-09-14T22:13Z,"Install Steam. Log in to your account. Install Black Mesa. Let the game launch. Nothing will happens because Steam will automatically update Source SDK Base 2007 (about 4,7GB). Restart Steam to recognize the game. Play the game.
Final size of all is about 11GB."
,nignug,2012-09-14T22:22Z,"@czejenesku Seriously dude the cheapest source game is probably $5 tops. If you have never bought a Source game on Steam....

Anyways is this mod worth DLing? I remember following this mod years ago, but they never released it on a scheduled time."
,czejenesku,2012-09-14T23:25Z,"@nignug
I own every HL game (HL1+expansions and Orange Box), so it wasnt a problem for me i was just pointing out the stuff to other people.

And YES! i was playing it now and its awesome - coming back to Black Mesa facility after so many years and seeing it in new graphics... DELIGHT! it has everything HL1 had - recognizable voices, comedy, clickable stuff... and most of all - it still has the most important thing - MOOD!!! it still above and all Half Life 1 game... when they will finish it - it playable only till Lambda Core level (guys are working hard to recreate Xen levels which is hard aparently), its around 8hrs gameplay, still longer than most shooters now - i'll replay it again and HL2+episodes after that to give me one cohesive cinematic experience... All in all you can clearly see the love the makers of this have for HL franchise... if you like HL games i highly recommend this"
,amorlombresias,2012-09-15T02:46Z,Awesome !!!
,vp89,2012-09-15T05:57Z,PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME AFTER DOWNLOADING THIS.
,VitorCz,2012-09-15T18:22Z,how do i play this shit?
,XxHABlOSxX,2012-09-16T01:57Z,im assuming u run the setup
,tribescribe_123,2012-09-16T07:23Z,"Don't download this shit! It only works if you have a legal paid copy of half life 2!

3 GB wasted, thanks jackass!
Even when a standalone version could already be made, this idiot just uploaded the steam version on a torrent site."
,dr.candy,2012-09-16T09:50Z,how dafuq do i play this fuckin shit!!!man i wasted 2hours for this shit and i cant even play this shit :|
,Zipgun,2012-09-16T11:21Z,"@tribescribe_123  Why dumbass? Just because you're and the rest of you whiners are to damn fucking poor to buy a copy of an old ass game. Just like the rest of you fucking morons who are to freaking stupid to even get this to work. No surprise only FUCKING NOOBS download off of PUBLIC trackers like this one.

But its freaking great news! Keeps the fucking trailer park riff raff off the servers running this game. LOL. Fuck off losers and keep on crying like the bitches you are."
,vardas,2012-09-16T12:18Z,"Guys, stop whining! This is the official version and works flawlessly!

1. Download Source SDK 2007 from Steam (It's free!)
2. Download Black Mesa
3. Run Black Mesa setup
4. Once finished restart Steam and it will show up in your games list"
,czejenesku,2012-09-16T22:13Z,"@Zipgun
i sometimes wonder - how can someone call themselves a gamer and not own HL2 games is beyond my imagination "
,Euqah,2012-09-17T02:14Z,"Brava to @vardas. Thanks, guy."
,AlphaActual,2012-09-17T13:45Z,"Great torrent.Game works great.
Haha noob whiners."
,666Apocalypse666,2012-09-17T16:29Z,"It works perfect and you don't need to download anything other than steam, the source sdk 2007 is downloaded automatically when you first start the game from steam"

TPB could really use a comment rating system of some sort to make helpful comments like this more immediately obvious."

,orfis333d,2012-09-22T22:01Z,"what is steam ??

,billpao13,2012-09-29T12:18Z,"Make sure to have steam installed in order to play this
1. Download the game
2. Run Setup
3. After installation, run Black Mesa. There will be a pop up asking you to download SDK Base 2007
4. Install it
5. Restart steam
6. Go to your library, and
Enjoy!"
,numse,2012-09-29T18:20Z,"omg the amount of morons!!!! lols
