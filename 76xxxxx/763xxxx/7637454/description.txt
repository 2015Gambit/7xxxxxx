Since the other uploads of this movie either had a/v sync issues or were hardcoded with subtitles in other languages, I took it upon myself to fix that problem. After spending the better part of a day on this, here I am to share it with you all! A/V sync should be pretty good now; I also found a decent set of English softcoded subtitles, much better than the ones in the other English release on TPB. Enjoy!
