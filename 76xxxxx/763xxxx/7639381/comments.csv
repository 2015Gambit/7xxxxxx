[V],Horrorspoke,2012-09-15T22:41Z,"Region 6 (R6) is meant to be a Chinese source (In terms of a DVD). If you see in my notes at the top, I was unsure if this truly was a R6, however it has been labelled as such and I don't really have much reason to believe otherwise."
,pottermouth,2012-09-15T23:23Z,thanks pal
,Revisionist,2012-09-16T02:40Z,@pottermouth... just avoid R6. People are probably selling these for a $1 on some corner in Shanghai.
,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-09-16T04:51Z,looks craptastic
,Gacy8Gein,2012-09-16T11:39Z,"Its a HD TS like all the others out there.
Even if it has come from a Chinese website, its still TS quality.
As an R6 its V5 /A7
As an HD TS its v7 / a7

Probably filmed the 3D version of it, thats why there are so many blurry scenes, and the framerate isn't perfect either.

Watchable if you haven't seen it yet."

This movie wasn't released in 3d, just normal and imax. 

The quality isn't bad for a ts, it's in focus the whole time, not too dark, no flicker, no cropping, no camera movement, no people walking in front of the camera. And oddly enough this ts contains the full credits at the end, it looks like it might have been shoot from the projection booth with a tripod. however the big problem is that it's blurry when theres movement, and also choppy almost as if your watching a webcam stream at times. Plus it's poorly compressed, lots of blocking artifacts like a youtube video or something."
,sats1969,2012-09-16T13:39Z,"looks to me like a ts version,wait for a proper dvdrip.
thanks uploader for the effort."
,booster69,2012-09-16T14:25Z,"The quality certainly is a lot better than the other TS's out there. Some scenes are blurry and there are moments with skipped frames, an example of which is the football stadium scene.
Interestingly enough the end credits roll with stereo audio, while the rest of the movie has mono line audio.
I genuinely thought this could have been a poorly encoded R6 with english line audio during the movie for dialogue purposes. Based on other comments I guess it is a TS."
,tflagger997,2012-09-18T01:29Z,Not 720p.  This is an upsized cam.  More scamming from green skullers.
