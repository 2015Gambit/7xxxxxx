Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy
In the past several years documentary filmmaker Gary Hustwit has made a trio of fascinating movies about design: Helvetica, Objectified and Urbanized. Taken as a whole they explore design in an elaborate fashion, ranging from the small (with Helvetica discussing graphic design and its tiniest details in typography) to the very large (cities and city planning in Urbanized). Hustwit is at his best when emphasizing the small details.-from the pixel of Helvetica's computer screens to the chairs and cars of Objectified to the roads and buildings of Urbanized-not a single detail will be missed. Every piece of our world, from smallest to biggest, is accounted for and explored for the vast amounts of thought, creativity, and pain that goes into its realization. Hustwit's greatest accomplishment is that, with great humor and grace, he makes it so you can't (or at least don't want to) take anything for granted or look at things in the same way ever again.




2)  Objectified 
Objectified is a feature-length documentary about our complex relationship with manufactured objects and, by extension, the people who design them. It's a look at the creativity at work behind everything from toothbrushes to tech gadgets. It's about the designers who re-examine, re-evaluate and re-invent our manufactured environment on a daily basis. It's about personal expression, identity, consumerism, and sustainability. Through verite footage and in-depth conversations, the film documents the creative processes of some of the world's most influential product designers, and looks at how the things they make impact our lives. What can we learn about who we are, and who we want to be, from the objects with which we surround ourselves?
