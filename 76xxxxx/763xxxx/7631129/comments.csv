,raindr0ps,2012-09-15T02:59Z,"I am afraid I do not understand Msta_sos90 comment. Except for the original poster, we are all leechers until we get the complete file. To have leechers, tho, we need a seeder. I have not download this torrent and so do not know if it is actually being seeded.  If Msta_sos90 is concerned there are no seeders, that indicates to me that he is himself a leecher. 
Without leechers there will never be more than one seeder."
,TrollFighter,2012-09-24T13:05Z,I would be more than glad to thank you...if and when you seed this.
,TrollFighter,2012-09-24T13:08Z,It has been stuck at 94.6% for a very long time now.

OK, most of the content of this torrent is just Japanese for Busy People, Pimsleur, and Genki, which you can get in many other torrents. This is just Meguro Language Center's take on it. And, if you plan at using these in the MLC program at Meguro, they will throw a shit-fit. Japan has VERY different laws on torrents; in fact, the penalties are very stiff...and, could end up getting you bounced (permanently) from Japan. No, I am not a plant...I do not talk shit. I use torrents quite a bit, so I am not a torrent virgin. Anyway, the whole thing is moot, because this joker has no plan of seeding this torrent. It has been stuck at 94.6 since he posted it. Just check the content of the torrent and download it from somewhere else. Anyway, I added that caution about Japan simply for informational purposes."
