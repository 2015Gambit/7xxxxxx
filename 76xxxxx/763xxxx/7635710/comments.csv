,spam_hater,2012-09-14T16:00Z,Why 320Kbps when iTunes is the source? They sell 256Kbps songs...
,yelisey90,2012-09-14T17:43Z,"iTunes sells aac (.m4a) files at 256kbps, and their quality is considered superior to that of 256kbps mp3s... maybe not as good as 320kpbs mp3s (or maybe it is), but if you want get mp3s out of iTunes downloads, better convert to 320kbps..."

,DimsumDynam,2012-09-15T01:21Z,"Something about this doesn't seem right about this release. The iTunes files are in "".m4a"" with a bitrate of 256kbps and the total file size of the album is 179MB. Now if all these files were converted to 320kbps then that means each file would be bigger than its equivalent m4a 256kbps version. So why is this release 174Mb in size? 5MB less! There is no way this would happen as 320 bitrate files would be larger. Seems to me these files might be VBR and not CBR. Something closer to around 200MB would be more realistic."
