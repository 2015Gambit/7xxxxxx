,fistxuck,2012-09-27T15:11Z,THANK YOU! I needed this for school (I would love an ebook!) and with financial aid BS I cant get my books until a week after school! You saved me trips to the library all week and saved me from the line in the bookstore & $$$! Im in your debt. If YOU need anything.........
,fistxuck,2012-09-27T15:20Z,I just realized its JUST the book files. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put up the Ebook. I will point a few of my fellow students this way and we will all give you glorious comments! Thanks for this though! These torrrents are what really help the little guys like me. 
,fistxuck,2012-09-28T15:47Z,I was going to try to message you through email or Facebook so I searched for manicgamer. WOW. Too many possibilities. So im back here.
,fistxuck,2012-09-28T15:47Z," I need the book by Tues. Oct 2nd or else I have to buy it. I get fin. aid so thats ok, but I would still like to have the ebook format and I dont want to purchase both. "
,fistxuck,2012-09-28T15:50Z,"Maybe I could ""rent"" the ebook you have for a small donation?"
,fistxuck,2012-09-28T15:52Z, You can email me at fistxuck on hotmail if you are intrerested. Having these book files though has been GREAT! Saved me ALOT of time.
,fistxuck,2012-09-28T15:54Z, I had to make my comment into so many pieces because it kept having a system error. I just figured out it was because I wrote out the email address. Sorry for so MANY comments. It WAS just one.
