,Jc00ls0x,2012-09-18T01:23Z,"Just to let everyone know, I'm going to stop seeding this when my sharing ratio gets to 50 (that's 5000%). It's currently 18.7, so there's still quite a bit of time."
,Ryanaft,2012-09-19T01:37Z,"I downloaded and all I got was a file that lists its type as ""file"" Anyone know how I can get the game working?"
,Jc00ls0x,2012-09-19T10:37Z,"Try renaming it to ""FTL_v1.01_Install.exe"""
,Jc00ls0x,2012-09-21T01:31Z,"I've stopped seeding this as my ratio just hit 50, but if this goes dead it can be downloaded directly here: (mediafire) /download.php?9xq2hzx6ltgncfa"
