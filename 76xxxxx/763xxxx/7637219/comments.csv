Funny how the people that support Obama are the people that know the least about whats really going in in the government and world.

Anyone that relies on the news for everything and believes it all are suckers for the propagandists."

,LemonJ-Lo,2012-09-15T18:07Z,"@ercwynn: Amen to that.  So interesting how the wealthy and powerful have convinced the poor and uneducated that they have Everyman's best interests at heart.  It would be hard to find a more heart- and soulless bunch.
