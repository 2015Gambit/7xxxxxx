While illicit drug use may have pervaded wars in the past, the Vietnam War was the first to be shrouded in a continuous, thick haze of pot smoke. Which led Ted Richards to create Dopin' Dan, perhaps the most endearing male character in underground comic book history. Richards, whose father was a WWII paratrooper, conveyed the original story of Dopin' Dan in a trilogy of comic books that came out in 1972 and '73.

The first two books contain many funny tales of modern military life, including some short stories by other artists (e.g., Willy Murphy, Gary Hallgren, Shary Flenniken, Bobby London). The final book is all Ted Richards and shows us life after the war ends, when Dopin' Dan is released from the army and heads home. The third issue endears us to Dan as we catch a peek of his Southern-fried origins.

After the original Dopin' Dan trilogy ended, Ted Richards produced more Dopin' Dan comics for several issues of Rip Off Comix in the mid-to-late '70s. During the same era, he created The Forty Year Old Hippie and Mellow Cat. Richards returned to his signature character in 1981 and produced Today's Army with Dopin' Dan.
