,jaguar13x,2012-09-15T12:15Z,thanks!
,yurune,2012-09-15T12:17Z,Thanks for Overtime & the extra!  It would be cool if you could put the political skits from Saturday Night Live with this too!  :D
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T13:07Z,"I just want to say that you've been doing a wonderful job for a very long time. Many of us truly notice it and appreciate it.

Our community needs more like you.

Thank you very much."
,UTF1127,2012-09-15T13:16Z,What kind of file type is this? I can't play it with ANYTHING. Hopefully MP4SUX gets his version uploaded soon. 
,MP4SUX,2012-09-15T13:37Z,"Practical Advice - I started posting anonymously and it seemed very secure. Let my work speak for itself and all that.

But what I found important is a good VPN. You see, they can tell when you first post what IP has the only complete copy.

Security resides in having a handle here connected to an Email address that cannot be easily tied to you.

It's how anyone reading this can participate in this great adventure in human networking."
,simonkra,2012-09-15T13:43Z,"Nice going!  All the extras and small size.
Thanks much.

,falafelface,2012-09-15T17:35Z,Dang...  129mb's for the full show is virtually as good quality as the usual 55omb uploads!
,aaronlavsky,2012-09-15T17:49Z,Thanks!
,roxx13,2012-09-15T19:06Z,"thank you for this upload...really appreciate it...btw, this is a mkv file that can be played with VLC media player for those who are having trouble playing it...been there ....:)"
,lattari,2012-09-15T20:47Z,"Thanks. The video quality is not as hideous as you might think, considering the size. Its surprisingly watchable.

I wonder what's taking with the regular uploads?"
,lattari,2012-09-15T20:53Z,"btw, I like your idea about posting anonymous. There is an ugly feature among many people in file sharing, one that seeks to promote self and ego through 'good' deeds.  Its quite annoying and not part of what sharing is supposed to be about. I get credit, and I am thankful and all that. I just think some people's self appraisal has gotten out of hand.

Posting anonymous is an excellent way to send a counter message."
,BPeppy1,2012-09-15T20:53Z,"Let me add my words of thanks to the uploader (whomever you are) for this torrent.  I'll admit I was suspicious of the anonymous posting and small file size but when you were the only source for this show, I gave it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  I got to see the segment from Brian William's Rock Center that was informative and timely.

In the future, I look forward to your uploads, just wish there was a way of distinguishing you."
,RonaldMund,2012-09-15T21:09Z,Thanks uploader ;)
[T],theburningbush,2012-09-15T22:12Z,"Thank you!

Quality is way beyond adequate, IMO.

And, your timeliness is greatly appreciated. This is, after all, a news-related program, and after awhile, it becomes ""olds,"" not ""news.""

As so often happens with this program, the regular ""big-boy"" posters dropped the ball on timely posting, so, again, many thanks!"
,mumphabot,2012-09-15T23:51Z,"First: thank you for this.

2nd: I'm not sure I need much more adequate display of democracy in action than a 1700+ seed torrent that maxes out my connection and comes down in less than a minute. Thanks to everybody seeding. If you're American or if you can wherever else you are, VOTE!"
,BoonesFerry,2012-09-16T00:33Z,I greatly appreciate that you include Overtime AND Bill's appearances on other shows for the week. Bravo!
,EliteBeast,2012-09-16T00:53Z,The quality is awesome for the file size. wow encoder handbrake.
,LuxLOL,2012-09-16T04:54Z,It wouldn't hurt to have better quality.
,DrChiron,2012-09-16T06:21Z,"Thank you for your work. i was dhocked to see how fast this downloaded. i was going to watch porn first but i didn't have time! As this thx is prior to watching, I cannot comment on the quality, but as someone who won't watch std def, I always watch BILL however I can. THX again."
,MindFragg,2012-09-16T06:21Z,thank you very much
,killeurkilleur,2012-09-16T07:27Z,you should upload more stuff man...great quality 
,ItsASpork,2012-09-16T08:20Z,This is one of the best recurring torrents on TPB. That it's roughly the same quality as the 500MB files is impressive.

,Kalambaka,2012-09-16T17:15Z,forget my previous link ...
,captsmoke,2012-09-16T18:03Z,"Great quality torrent. Thank you Anonymous, thank yoU PirateBay."
,datank00,2012-09-16T19:00Z,"very good torrent. i didn't think the quality would be that great, but it's not much worse than standard 500+mb size quality. thanks!"
,susulock,2012-09-16T20:24Z,"Uploader Anonymous, video quality is good enough but audio isn't. Please next time onwards, upload audio at 128 kbps. The size doesn't increase much either. Please consider. TY."
,susulock,2012-09-16T22:24Z,Also switch to mp4 and use aac audio codec(not VORBIS).
,tunamoon,2012-09-17T01:42Z,"I would stick to mkv. It is a superor container. Matroska, x264 and Vorbis are also free to use. Open source software Rocks!"
,trace535,2012-09-17T03:25Z,"Since this is a talk show, audio is what matters most, and it should be at least 96 kpbs AAC, while the resolution could safely be dropped to 624x352, of course keeping the CRF at 24.

Anyway, great upload, thank you and you should create a username and start uploading with it so you can build on a reputation for quality."
,audioforanarchists,2012-09-17T05:26Z,"Don't listen to anybody here... The audio/video quality is just fine.
V:9
A:9"
,shimarlie,2012-09-17T10:59Z,"I aint gonna bitch. But I would love the full 550mb copy. Can't even get Bill in Australia and I think this is going to be a stretch for the 60 inch TV.

However..I appreciate the upload...next time can you meet half way? :D Maybe like 350Mb?
