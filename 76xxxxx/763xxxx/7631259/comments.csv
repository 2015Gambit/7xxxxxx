It seems you did not keep your word so i have now blocked your img host, again. This time it stays blocked. any attempt to go over this block with redirects etc will end up you getting permanently banned"
,newupload,2012-09-13T16:51Z,but nothing is forced here like click to continue or something like that...and i think its clean as it was before...why r u doin this to me
,newupload,2012-09-13T16:53Z,i am not that technical so that i can use redirects or anything else i can only request you to unblock...u can block it if you recieved any complains from the user if they feel irritated or anything else plsssssss
