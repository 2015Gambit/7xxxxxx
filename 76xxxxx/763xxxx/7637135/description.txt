Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, September 14 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the increasing insanity in response to an anti-Islam video that is making its way across the internet after the death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya. 

He also covers Obama's appeal against a court ruling striking down the indefinite detention of American citizens and other news. 

Alex's guest today is investigative journalist Ben Swann who interviewed Obama about why his administration is fighting the injunction issued by a federal judge prohibiting the indefinite detention of American citizens under Sections 1021 and 1022 of the NDAA. Swann works for FOX19 Evening News in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is the recipient of both an Edward R. Murrow Award and two Emmy's.
