If you have Windows vista,8,7 run it as administrator.Also you need net framework to make this work.

I have tested in 3 pc with Windows xp 2 with windows 7 and 1 with windows and in all it work perfectly"
,NixeaKip,2012-09-17T01:11Z,TuneUp can tell it's not original software and it blocks itself. Any ideas on how to deal with that?
,nicklas1015,2012-09-17T11:16Z,"bobiras are you stupid?
I say it doesnt work then it doesnt work. I dont care if you would be the developer of TPB, it still doesnt work!

I check in the task manager, a .exe opens and closes itselft after some second.

Dont troll by saying that i troll your trolling troll torrents"

,ryjus,2012-09-17T13:59Z,"@nicklas1015 Maybe before you call someone stupid and try to tell everybody this doesn't work, try following directions. WORKS 100% Doesn't take a fucking Rocket Scientist to figure out how to get this to work!! "
,nicklas1015,2012-09-17T16:09Z,"Omg idiot after idiot...

Okay, so the instruction:

1.Disconnect from the internet- DONE THAT.
2.Run TuneUp Utilities 2012 12.0.3600.114 Final Cracked bobiras2009- DOESNT WORK. NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN DOUBLE CLICK.

It doesnt take a rocket sicentist to figure out that just because it works for you doesnt mean it works for every PC in this world"
