Description:

Flash Professional CS6 is such a powerful program that it can seem overwhelming to new or occasional users. With Flash Professional CS6: Visual QuickStart Guide, readers get a solid grounding in the fundamentals of the most recent version of the software.

Highlights include new user options for setting document properties when creating or modifying documents; new layout and options in the Publish Settings dialog; working with tabbed text in Flash's text-layout framework; copying and pasting Timeline layers. Plus, learn about new options for exporting assets created in Flash as a PNG sequence; as a spite sheet, or as JavaScript and HTML5, via the CreateJS extension.

Includes eBook and Video Access
In addition to concise, step-by-step explanations of core tools and tasks, with plenty of helpful screen shots to keep you on track as you work, Flash Professional CS6: Visual QuickStart Guide includes an hour-long HD video and eBook. In addition to reading about how to use the tool, you can watch it in action. You can also download digital versions of this book to load on the mobile device of your choice so that you can continue learning whenever and wherever you are. We provide you with both the ePub and PDF to ensure that you get the experience that best suits your viewing needs.


Notes:

-The Video Fundamentals files are in .qt format and require QuickTime to play.

-The permissions on the .pdf are password-protected by the publisher. I haven't found a way to remove this without having the password, so Acrobat Pro won't let you edit the document, copy/extract single pages, or change the permissions.
