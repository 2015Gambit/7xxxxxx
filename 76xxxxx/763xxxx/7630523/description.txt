Just the ioQuake3 game engine with key checks removed. For those who don't want to type their cd key in after installing (you have a CD key for your copy of the game, right?). 

CD keys are easy to get (or find), so This is only for the truly lazy. It works, I've tested it. 

This is just the game engine. You need the game data files to play (from your cd, you did buy the cd, right?).


Ignore my last upload. this one is the one I will be seeding.
