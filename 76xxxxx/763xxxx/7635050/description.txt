A mix of darting Zappa-jazz hooks, sinister electronics, Ornette Colemanesque
sax and hefty rock drumming brought young London quartet Led Bib a Mercury
prize nomination in 2009. The band's latest album will almost certainly expand
their audience through a more thematically varied repertoire, without
sacrificing any of their usual euphoric momentum. Led Bib sounds like a
heavy-metal guitar group on the opening Moth Dilemma, with Toby McLaren's keys
laying fuzz-chords under the alto saxes of Chris Williams and Pete Grogan, as
the piece builds to a frenetic funkiness. Sometimes, a single sax will toy with
a staccato free-jazz motif, sometimes hooting electronic sounds shadow brusque
melody. Hollow-wind noises curl round horror-movie themes and Liran Donin's
acoustic bass unfolds bluesy figures that are greeted by breathy sax lines and
rising horn harmonies. The set starts with punchy grooving and ends on the
cymbal shivers and wistful melodies of the closing Winter ΓÇô and if Bring Your
Own was intended to summarise where this energetic group has been and might
still go, it succeeds admirably.
