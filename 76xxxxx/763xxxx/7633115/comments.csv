I don't know if the uploader decided to embed website advertisements into the movie, but I wish the person or whoever did it hadn't. In the beginning of the movie there is a flashing of websites addresses embedded into the movie, then toward the last 45 minutes or so of the movie a constant website address is shown in the lower right corner of the movie advertising a website called ISAITHAI.NET. Unfortunately this is NOT a subtitle that can be turned off and while the person who did this could have just included a file within the download about the websites, this PERMANENT on screen display can be annoying while watching the movie. Please for the future put those advertisements in a separate file so the movie can be enjoyed fully. This constantly displayed ad is like watching cable tv that displays a station's logo on the screen constantly."
