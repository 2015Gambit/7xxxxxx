Requirements: 2.2 and up
Overview: Its a fairly simple App that will put CPU 1/2/3 OFFLINE when the screen turns off. Once the screen comes back on, it will allow CPU 1/2/3 back ONLINE.

How does it work?
Since we have Dual & Quad core CPUs, we have a CPU 0 and a CPU 1/2/3, core 0/1/2/3, while the screen is off we really only need to have 1 core active "CPU0", this App will make sure CPU 1/2/3 shuts off while the screen is off, then resumes normal usage when the screen comes back on.

Compatibility?
Works with any Dual Core & Quad Core Devices!

Battery Saving?
Battery savings all depends on Usage & idle times.

What's in this version:
Version 3.7 Release Notes:
Galaxy Nexus leankernel does not work with this app & I recommend the Stock kernel if you wish to use this App.
~ Everything is Fixed & working via 3.7
~ 3.7 Is now the Final Build!
~ If you get Wake issues, it's likely a Kernel related issue, If you get these Issues try out Different Kernel setups.
