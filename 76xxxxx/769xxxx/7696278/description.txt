MOBILedit! is software that brings the ability to control the phone from your PC. After connecting the phone via cable, IrDA or Bluetooth, you can view the contents of the phone on the PC, do full-text searches, dial numbers, send SMS or MMS messages, synchronize, add, edit, or delete anything youΓÇÖd like. With a simple click, backup all your data, copy them to different mobile phones and manipulate your contacts without even touching the phone. When you receive a message, it arrives on your PC in a similar way as an email; simply reply to it or move it to the archive. MOBILedit! users enjoy a long list of features. From its extensive Phonebook utilities to its SMS handling, MOBILedit! not only supports more makes and models than any other, but the list of features grows equally as fast.
