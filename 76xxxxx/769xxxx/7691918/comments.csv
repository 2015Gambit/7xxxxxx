,fittzy28,2012-10-03T16:38Z,can someone please tell me if you download a video that says +subtitles are there subtitles through the whole thing or can you watch it without?
,atticus0584,2012-10-03T17:33Z,"hey fittzy, if it has the subtitles throughout the whole thing all you have to do is find the .srt file in the group of files and delete it. The .srt is the subtitles file. Simple as that :)"
,CherokeeChick,2012-10-03T20:25Z,This did not work!  Took forever too...found a better one.  Don't waste your time.
,mentalityx,2012-10-03T23:33Z,Works fast for me. All good from what I see. Thanks G
