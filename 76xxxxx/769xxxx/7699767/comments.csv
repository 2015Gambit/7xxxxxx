This is a Russian copy Bluray, so the audio is dubbed over from a DVD rip, so its not HD audio as it should be on a Bluray rip! "

[T],xxbel,2012-10-06T02:56Z,"seriously Mikey320? I don't have a chance to run through yet, if so, this is bad..."
,eshanhr,2012-10-06T03:45Z,Nice work dude.. as soon. I;m waiting for 700mb version. plz upload if you can...
,sdsucks,2012-10-06T04:36Z,"PQ's very bad.
Looks like a DVD upscale.
Source can't be Blu-ray."
,phase700b,2012-10-06T05:52Z,"I wonder if BOZX got fooled again, like with that Prometheus upscale."
[T],xxbel,2012-10-06T06:57Z,"well no complain on the quality... but the embed sub inside the movie are all over the place.. wrong wordings which you can be pretty sure. Alright, I'll wait for a better one patiently. Those two I uploaded are Russian vocal (Remux)."
