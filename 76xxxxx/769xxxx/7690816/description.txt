'Ravens & Rainbows'

Pacific Comics, 1983

Written and Illustrated by Jeffrey Jones


It's a shame there isn't more complete Jeffrey Jones material available. What is available, for the most part, is badly scanned and put together piecemeal, incomplete. This books was complete, however, and looked pretty good. I grabbed a dozen or so nice looking short story pages that fit the tone of this collection from some of those other sources and added them in before the back cover. That's why I've labeled it 'Expanded'.

Part of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader some of you may actually need to shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.

After it was pointed out to me that people were getting a GonVisor popup, I am now creating these books in such a way as to have stopped that from happening. No GonVisor popup will appear on any 'Restorations' in the future.
