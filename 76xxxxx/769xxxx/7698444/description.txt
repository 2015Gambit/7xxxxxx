Seems like the people downloading these know more about Discworld and Terry Pratchett (I know him from Good Omens) than I do, so I'm going to upload this batch without much preamble. This one also looks really good. Nothing bad to say about it. Should mention that 'all sizes' actually means 'all ages', of course. This is a Discworld children's book. But since it's a Terry Pratchet, Discworld children's book, it's a little bit more strange than the average children's book.
