Motherhood: A Radio Collection

A Prairie Home Companion celebrates that one person who manages to make you feel that youΓÇÖre special and that you aren't living up to your potentialΓÇöall in the same sentence. Sketches, songs, and stories from Garrison and the regular cast cover the gamut of all that goes into and comes out of motherhood.

Motherhood is a popular topic on A Prairie Home Companion, and not just on MotherΓÇÖs Day. ItΓÇÖs about time someone gathered the best bits into an homage to Mom. This funny, affectionate, poignant collection honors the woman who gave up her own sense of self-worth for a life of mindless drudgery, day in and day out, all for you. The woman who sticks around when everyone else in your life turns away. Who insists ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt worry about me, IΓÇÖm fine. All I need is to know that youΓÇÖre happy.ΓÇ¥ Who doesn't leave messages because motherhood is not about messages, itΓÇÖs about love. Share it with your mom or give it to a mom you know. If youΓÇÖre a mom yourself, hand it to your child and say ΓÇ£Listen.ΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs the least he or she can do.
