I have done the surveys and downloaded three different keygens - none of them work.

the one that 'ski' put out, when you run it it tells you that you need the newer version of the keygen and directs you to a second survey page. After completing the second survey you download the second keygen and it tells you that you dont have the right version of NET., this is not a windows message but a message programmed into this scam of a keygen. They got three surveys from me - scammers. BE WARNED."
