DESCRiPTiON

If Channel 4 had a their very own hotel then Gordon Ramsay would be the chef
and Mary Portas would take charge of the rooms. Gok Wan would run the bar and
be in charge of events while Phil Spencer would be Maitre D'. Christian Jessen
would head-up the gym while Kim Woodburn would take on housekeeping. Kirstie
Allsopp could be concierge and Katie Piper would be in charge of the spa. The
celebrities take charge of a hotel for a week as they train unemployed people
who want to prove they are capable of succeeding in the workplace. They have
to deal with members of the public at all hours of the day, managing
complaints and catering to their needs in the establishment's many facilities.
They also compete to see who can raise the most money for a range of
employment charities.
