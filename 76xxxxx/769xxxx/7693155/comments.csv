Listen to the strings just before Gilmour's solo on ""Comfortably Numb"", they soar here in comparison.

But I guess if you're listening to a tiny MP3 player and ear buds while delivering papers it doesn't really make a difference...."

There are not many media players that play FLAC.  Oh and you seem to think I'm a paperboy which is wierd because I'm not.  I think you just got pissed because I posted my torrent in yours like you did me.  Ha ha ha take your own medicine you piece of shit."
[T],rjordan21,2012-10-03T23:06Z,"Did I cry about your link?  No.  Post as many links as you want junior, it doesn't bother me at all.  At the end of the day I'm only interested in the best sound.

I'm not ripping on your Sansa.  It's cute and works well, that's why I bought one for my 6 year old, but if you're really using that little pc. of plastic to critically listen to music everything makes sense....

Happy Listening!
