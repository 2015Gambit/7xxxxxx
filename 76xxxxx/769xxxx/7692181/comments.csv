[V],Subzero!,2012-10-03T23:43Z,"all has been triple checked, this works flawlessly, if you have any problems running the game, iams ure, you system files are not up to date, such as directx and other redistributable files, so piss off Sirtlk"

,bentiger,2012-10-04T05:49Z,"Shroo, why is registration closed in your website?"
,csgo4life,2012-10-04T10:19Z,"okay i know it is blatantly clear that nothing has been ripped, but there are comments on recoding the vidoes/audio to lower bitrate... so im assuming the whole thing is untouched right?"
,csgo4life,2012-10-04T10:21Z,*there are no comments
,bentiger,2012-10-04T10:59Z,"I verified so far all the textures, movies and audios and all are of higher clarity and since this is from TPTB whose torrents are always perfect and this is a fullrip meaning, that the contents are just compressed and notheing is removed... ive been playing for 5 hours now without any lags or any missing things"
,y0rke,2012-10-04T22:10Z,"it says ""The program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""
how to fix that?"
,gmoujik,2012-10-04T23:09Z,"I ran setup for over an hour. Nothing happens apart from TPTB screen saver. W7, 7-zip2.29. DirectX updated.
it says 15-30 mins. But after an hour you realize it's faster to download another version."
,gmoujik,2012-10-04T23:33Z,"A negative comment disappeared. Download this if you wanna stare at flying ""TPTB""!"
,lPeaceMakerl,2012-10-05T05:24Z,"Sorry I was so late to leave a comment... i was enjoying this game so much I forgot to leave a comment. 

1.) Thanks Shroo
2.) Works flawlessly
3.) There aren't viruses.......you can trust Shroo / TPTB


Again, thank you."
