South Africa Walks with Julia Bradbury 
Having tackled treks across the UK, Julia Bradbury embarks on a grand adventure in South Africa. As the world focuses its attention on the World Cup host nation, Julia sets out on four different walks that explore South Africa's claim to be 'a world in one country'. Television presenter Julia Bradbury (WAINWRIGHT WALKS) explores the stunning landscapes of South Africa; venturing along the world famous Garden Route, the Drakensberg mountain range, the Kruger National Park and the Augrabies Falls.




2)  Drakensberg 
Julia moves to the interior for her second walk and the grandest mountain range in southern Africa, the Drakensberg. The 3,000m Cathedral Peak is the ambition for Julia and her Zulu guide Zee. As she quickly discovers, even the fittest and most experienced walkers need luck on their side when it comes to the dramatic weather of these mountains. With Zulus, Brits and Boers to provide the history, this is an outing filled with drama and fascination set against a backdrop sometimes described as the most beautiful on earth.
