The Truth about Climate Change 
Are We Changing Planet Earth? And Can We Save Planet Earth? Are two programmes that form a documentary about global warming, presented by David Attenborough. They were first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 24 May and 1st June 2006 respectively.
 Travel from the collapsing ecosystem of the Arctic to the low-lying islands of the South Pacific where flooding is now chronic and see alarming environmental issues in action. From Katrina-ravaged Louisiana and the failing Amazon rainforests to the bleaching Great Barrier Reef, the program offers definitive evidence of global warming, including retreating glaciers, rising seas, stronger hurricanes, severe droughts, encroaching deserts, and more. The thickening of Earth's carbon dioxide envelope is discussed in relation to our declining biosphere. The use of climate modelling confirms that fossil fuels are primarily responsible for a global rise in temperatures going far beyond any normal allowance for cyclical fluctuation.


1)  Are We Changing Planet Earth? 
In the first of a two-part documentary, David Attenborough explores just how far climate change is altering our planet, from drought-stricken rainforest to declining polar bears, from flooded homes to bleached coral. He searches for the evidence that it is our daily activities which are radically changing the climate, leaving the future of Earth largely up to us.
