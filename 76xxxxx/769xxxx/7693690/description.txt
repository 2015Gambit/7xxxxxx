A rogue sea dragon is attacking Berk's fishing ships, but Stoick and his men
have been unable to pursue the dragon by sailboat. Hiccup tries to convince
Stoick that he needs a dragon of his own for just such occasions. But when
Stoick decides to use Toothless, Hiccup needs to find a new dragon for
Stoick in order to get his own dragon back.
