,SrMLove,2012-10-04T01:45Z,"TPB is back up.... but when i click on ""get this torrent"".. i get redirected... instead of it the normal process of it going to utorrent and what not.... everything was fine until TPB was temporarily down.. i can now get all the way to the page to hit ""get his torrent"" but no further... i almost never have problems like this.. and all the forums i am searching for/through are only bringing up just the site going down.... am i the only one having this issue?...or is it happening to everyone? "
,SrMLove,2012-10-04T01:49Z,"The address wasn't understood

    Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (magnet) isn't associated with any program.


      You might need to install other software to open this address.

try again.


(my utorrent is up to date... do i need another program other than utorrent now after whats happened in the last couple of days"
