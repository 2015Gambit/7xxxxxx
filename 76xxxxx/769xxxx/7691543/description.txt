SuperUtils Uber Turing Machine
 
Uber Turing Machine Is Turing Machine Simulator for Windows 

Overview
 
Uber Turing Machine is a Turing machine simulator for students, academics, and programming enthusiasts. It enables to program, visualize, debug, run, and log Turing machine algorithms.
 
Key Features
 
This is the list of key features that presents our visual Turing machine simulator as a good choice for studying and programming the Turing machine:
 
Convenient creating of algorithms, ability to save and load them on/from a disk. 
Fast adding of repetitive data onto the tape. 
Verification of correctness of an alrogithm and tape data. 
Running and debugging in the three modes: normal, single-step, and a quick mode. 
Logging of programΓÇÖs execution, advanced output statistics. 
The following sample programs are already included with the Turing machine simulator: mathematical addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, getting the square and the cube of a number (i.e. raising to the second and to the third power, respectively), binary counting, straight/flipped copy of text, and palindrome detection. 
Detailed help documentation is included. 
The portable version of Uber Turing Machine is available. 
Works on all Microsoft Windows operating systems, from Windows 95 and 98, through 2000 and XP, up to the newest Windows Vista and 7, including x64 editions.
