Trojan

Rimmer receives an SOS Distress Call from a doomed ship commanded by his all-conquering 
brother, Howard. But Rimmer can't bring himself to save Howard until he's on an equal 
footing career-wise. He has 15 hours to pass his Astro-Nav exam and become an Officer. 
The same exam he's already failed nine times.
