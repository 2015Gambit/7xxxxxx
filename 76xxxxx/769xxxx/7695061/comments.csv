,michaelrwatson,2012-10-05T02:00Z,"@YIFY: Are you Arabic..? ""Yify"" sounds kind of Middle Eastern. Anyway, how about exporting things at resolution of 720x or 640x..? That's much more watchable for everyone who doesn't have a quad-core Pentium-X. Plus, you can make them smaller then , e.g. 350-400MB. Thanx."
