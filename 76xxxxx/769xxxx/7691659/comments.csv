,Dashman666,2012-10-04T02:06Z,"I'll try that!  It worked on one of my computers, but I when I ran it on my Window 7 64 bit it didn't show the patch area on the program.  I clicked on it, and it showed it... just didn't show the path button.  Weird!"
,Dashman666,2012-10-04T02:18Z,"Sorry been drinking Wine.... But when I tried to add it to my windows 7 64 bit.. I ran the patch and it popped up.  Music and all, but it seems the rights side of the patch wasn't visiable.  Anyone else get this?????  No where to click to get the patch work.  It worked on my load Latptop.  Strange........"
