After overcoming a number of obstacles, including convincing his prospective mother-in-law, Philomena D'Costa (Tun Tun) that he is not possessed by a demon, he discovers that not one but several Mr. Jetleys have a number of motives for killing their respective wives. Will Peter uncover the real Mr. Jetley who he overheard or will he uncover a number of dead Mrs. Jetleys?
