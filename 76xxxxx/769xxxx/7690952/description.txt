'Spirited Away Picture Book'

Viz Communications, 2002, 170 pages

Original Story and Screenplay Written and Directed by Hayao Miyazaki


One of my all-time favorite movies told in storybook form. In this particular instance the book contains hundreds of images from the movie set up partially like an illustrated book and partially like a comic book. Some pages have text sections with images, some pages have images with word bubbles and some pages have all three.

Since I imagine Hayao Miyazaki's name will bring a few people to this while searching, I think it only fair that I mention that the text in this book is 100% English language.
