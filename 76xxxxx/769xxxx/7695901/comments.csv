,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T22:32Z,"Pragmato - I didn't have to seed the torrent for very long, it had about 200 seeders after only 30 minutes. Good thing the episode is only about 171 MiB since it places very low demands on UL speeds for the original seeder until the torrents are self-sufficient. (But I am having fiber-optic cable installed as we speak. Hopefully I'll be able to do this again.)

I really liked Stephens ""I am America, and so can you"". I even listened to the audio book. (It was very cool, since it was Stephen who read it.) I am bound to check the new one out, but I'm a ""try before you buy"" kind of guy. If I like it, I'll buy it."
