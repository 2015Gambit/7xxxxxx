Plot: Four women different, but linked by a shared guilt: infanticide. Within a judicial psychiatric hospital, spend their time atoning a conviction that it is mainly inner guilt for an act that has wiped out their lives. By forced cohabitation, which in turn generates the pain of reading his own guilt in the other, sprout friendships, broken confessions, a comfort never fully comforting but that makes these women as guilty innocent. Clara, fought in accepting the forgiveness of her husband, who has rebuilt a life in Tuscany, reflects the effects of a life based on an apparent normality. Eloisa, passionate and direct, every time persists in arguing with the other, a cynicism just a facade. Rina, single mother, she drowned her daughter in the bathtub in a sort of euthanasia. Vincenza, despite the religion will be the only one to make a definitive act against itself. He still has two children, outside, and filled their pages of letters that will not send.
