This is a Discworld novel, I'm not sure where it falls in the overall order of the adapted graphic novels.

I'm uploading three Terry Pratchett graphic novels, all of which, for whatever reason, vary in quality from a visual standpoint. Honestly, none of them look particularly brilliant, but I never upload anything that I don't think is worth taking the time to view/read, so take my over critical opinions with a grain of salt.

This one looks pretty good. Still not perfect, but nothing that makes me think I need to mention it before somebody downloads it.
