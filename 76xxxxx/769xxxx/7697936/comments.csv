Thanks."

Torrents with RARs seed great for a few days then drop dead while the ones with NORMAL movie files continue to seed for weeks.

Why? Why would anyone want to use up double the storage space? As soon as they extract the RAR they delete the now-useless files.

In other words, RARS are for the retarded uploaders that think we all still use 56K modems and usenet."
