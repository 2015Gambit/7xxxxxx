Lyrics:
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've dreamed and dreamed this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall, and it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, and it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall

Let sky fall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

Let the sky fall, let it crumble
We will stand tall
And face it all together.
