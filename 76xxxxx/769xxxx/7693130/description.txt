This is a modded version of Minecraft by me, specially made to be FAST on low end computers such as netbooks with Intel GMA 950 chipsets. There are various texture packs included inside and the default one is 8x8 resolution. Yes, the game looks like CRAP, but if your slow PC can handle it then you should choose either 4x4, or 8x8, or 16x16 or the default texture pack.

You can select other lightweight texture packs to suit your hardware needs.
