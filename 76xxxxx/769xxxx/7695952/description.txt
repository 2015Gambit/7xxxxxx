Wild Mallorca
Singing toads, bee orchids, euphorbias and loggerhead turtles probably aren't the first things that spring to mind when you think of Mallorca. Yet the largest of the Balearic Islands is teeming with wildlife such as this. This lovingly photographed film takes a leisurely stroll through its sun-baked mountains, olive groves, lagoons and coastal waters to reveal Mallorca's "wild side". Yet, it's so gently lyrical that "wild" seems an inappropriate adjective. Even the footage of vultures picking at a carcass and a horde of lizards scuttling across the rocks for scraps is strangely soothing.
A holiday destination favoured by intellectuals, Mallorca is now overrun with tourists all summer. But is there a quieter side to the island? Beyond the bars and beaches lies a place inhabited by Europe's largest bird of prey, the black vulture, lizards that have survived from the time before man and rare seabirds found nowhere else in the world. It's a true wilderness where hidden valleys, untouched by the modern world, still hide secrets.
