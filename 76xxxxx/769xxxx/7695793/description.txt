South Africa Walks with Julia Bradbury 
Having tackled treks across the UK, Julia Bradbury embarks on a grand adventure in South Africa. As the world focuses its attention on the World Cup host nation, Julia sets out on four different walks that explore South Africa's claim to be 'a world in one country'. Television presenter Julia Bradbury (WAINWRIGHT WALKS) explores the stunning landscapes of South Africa; venturing along the world famous Garden Route, the Drakensberg mountain range, the Kruger National Park and the Augrabies Falls.






4)  Green Kalahari 
Julia's final walk takes her to the remote north-west corner of South Africa. This is the edge of the Kalahari Desert and the setting for Julia's most adventurous undertaking yet. Far away from the major tourist draws of the country, it is an insight into a true African world. Set against the stunning red geology of Augrabies National Park, it's a stark but beautiful walk, encountering simple rural lives and remarkable agriculture, utterly reliant on the broad waters of the Orange River.
