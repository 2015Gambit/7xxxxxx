QG 76 ΓÇô Stellar Mechanics

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Building from a simple geometric premise (of equilateral Energy) the geometry of all quantum mechanical processes within the SUN is revealed.

The solar dynamics of stars is revealed disproving the Fusion of elements and the CNO and P-P cycles in light of the electromagnetic energy radiation of GEM pinches

The seventy-sixth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
