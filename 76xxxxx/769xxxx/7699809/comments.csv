,stecar0x,2012-10-05T22:35Z,"It's real. Nobody downloading it seems to be seeding it other than me, apparently. My seedbox is uploading as fast as possible, so I don't know what to tell you."
,bipolar11,2012-10-05T22:54Z,Almost done downloading will let you know. 
,jc4321234,2012-10-05T23:04Z,its real and unedited. brilliant.
,IrishCeltic,2012-10-05T23:05Z,This is legit. An mkv file so depending on what you plan to watch it on it may or may not work but other than that good quality and pretty good download speeds too. Downloading the 2nd episode now which is going a small bit slower than this but still at an ok speed. Good job Stecarox.

,Drebin99,2012-10-06T01:58Z,Why is this the final season?  These fools become more entertaining (in a pathetic way) season after season.  By the time they're in their forties this show will be a hit!
,emmer1996,2012-10-06T05:31Z,"i'm not even getting 100kb/s half of the time, it's been downloading for over an hour, this sucks big time ):"
