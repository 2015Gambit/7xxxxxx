Jason has a problem. He doesnΓÇÖt remember anything before waking up in a bus full of kids on a field trip. Apparently he has a girlfriend named Piper and a best friend named Leo. TheyΓÇÖre all students at a boarding school for ΓÇ£bad kids.ΓÇ¥ What did Jason do to end up here? And where is here, exactly?

Piper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, ever since she had that terrifying nightmare. Piper doesnΓÇÖt understand her dream, or why her boyfriend suddenly doesnΓÇÖt recognize her. When a freak storm hits, unleashing strange creatures and whisking her, Jason, and Leo away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood, she has a feeling sheΓÇÖs going to find out.

Leo has a way with tools. When he sees his cabin at Camp Half-Blood, filled with power tools and machine parts, he feels right at home. But thereΓÇÖs weird stuff, tooΓÇölike the curse everyone keeps talking about. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist that each of themΓÇöincluding LeoΓÇöis related to a god.
