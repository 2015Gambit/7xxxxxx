I have developed an alternative track editor to microsoft's one, for motocross madness 1. It is faster and easier to use than ms te. You will find creating tracks a lot more enjoyable with this.

Please note that i have not yet reverse engineered the entire ms te save format, and therefore you need to load saved tracks with ms te to compile them and use them.

Currently im working on reverse engineering the .TER file format. It is not that difficult. It is just time consuming.
