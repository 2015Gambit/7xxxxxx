Wednesday night saw the first of three Presidential debates, and one Vice Presidential Debate, in the month of October. The first debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney took place at the University of Denver in Colorado. The topics focused on domestic policy with Jim Lehrer, host of NewsHour on PBS, moderating.

Original Air Date: Wednesday, October 3, 2012

Barack Obama and Mitt Romney clashed over taxes Wednesday night from the start of their first presidential debate, with each presenting his plan as the best way to revive growth and help the middle class.

Mr. Romney said he wanted to eliminate "deductions, credits and exemptions." He rejected charges that his tax plan would favor the wealthy, or make America's finances worse, saying, "I won't put in place a tax plan that adds to the deficit."

Mr. Obama said his opponent's plan would inevitably result in a higher budget deficit or large cuts to federal programs. "It's math, it's arithmetic," the president said, later adding, "That's not a recipe for job growth."

The presidential candidates met at the University of Denver for the first of three televised presidential debates. The candidates ranged widely over other domestic policies during the first hour of the debate, discussing energy, Medicare and the deficit among other issues.

Moderator Jim Lehrer seemed to lose control often and let each candidate continue talking. I don't necessarily think that was a bad thing. I think this was the first debate where the moderator did minimal talking and the candidates were given ample time to expand the discussion.

The next debate is Thursday, October 11, 2012 and will be between Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan.
