,Anonymous_xxx,2012-10-04T08:05Z,Thank you ..............
,mpjbay,2012-10-04T08:12Z,You are welcome. I am looking forward to watching it myself. :)
,mpjbay,2012-10-04T08:27Z,FYI - it looks like the firs 2:40 minutes the sound is wonky or non existent then they debate hosts tech team fixes the issue. 
,AlexLibman,2012-10-04T08:31Z,"Thank you for uploading so quickly, but more seeders are needed - everyone is stuck at 11%...

I didn't see it yet, but from what I hear it's good.  Hopefully it's a turning point, where the American voters will begin to judge Obama by the content of his character - and throw him the fuck out!"
,mpjbay,2012-10-04T08:44Z,I am watching it and Romney is not looking very good. OBAMA 2012 :)
,NYCBadGirl,2012-10-04T08:57Z,This American living abroad thanks you!  
,pragmato,2012-10-04T11:00Z,"decent quality, satisfying video & audio, file size appropriate, what else do you want?! also: downloaded it under half an hour, which is very n1 AND confirm not only wonky but inexistent sound for the first few minutes- Although, Thank you very much for sharing (and seeding!), I'm utmost grateful. "
,Buffy89,2012-10-04T11:11Z,Nice torrent! thanks for sharing! will keep uploading!
,AlexLibman,2012-10-04T18:01Z,"The aforementioned congestion with this torrent has cleared up, but last night I couldn't wait so I started watching from YouTube.

I do however hope that people will use torrents instead, and that more people will dump SpyOnYouTube videos to P2P networks, resulting in a more self-reliant Internet culture that is free from tracking and potential of censorship.

(My apologies for the geek-speak ahead - it's not for everybody.)

If you're using ""youtube-dl"" to download something for BitTorrent, please use the -t and --prefer-free-formats arguments.  (The latter was added in a recent version, run `sudo youtube-dl -U` to upgrade.)

The -t argument will add the YT ID (in this case ""dkrwUU_YApE"") to the filename, so in case of a slow torrent geeks will know how to get the exact same file.  Or, even more useful to geeks: you can use the --write-info-json argument, and include the JSON metadata in the torrent.

Using --prefer-free-formats will help get everyone on the same page regarding free codecs, using the most universally available option.  The WebM version of this video (format=45, 1280x720) is 760mb, compared to your non-free-software version at 827mb."
,AlexLibman,2012-10-04T18:25Z,"I think it is universally acknowledged at this point that Romney wiped the floor with Obama in that debate.  Obama looked like he was looking for a teleprompter the whole time, lol.

Romney was definitely the more honest of the participants.  Both were trying to appeal to the center, and Romney is indeed a centrist.  Obama trying to act moderate should win the Razzie Award.  (Dubya is clearly the Marlon Brando of political fakers, for making everyone believe that he wasn't an irreligious Yale economics egghead.)  Obama was benchmarked as ""the #1 most left-leaning Senator"" prior to his election as POTUS!  He is a son of a frothing-at-the-mouth big-C Communist retard whose ""dreams"" (by his own published admission) he inherited!  He has a lot of plans for his second term, as the result of which USA's economic freedom and international competitiveness would decline far more than it did in his first!

I would have very much preferred to see Ron Paul or Gary Johnson debating Obama (""two trillion that the Pentagon didn't even ask for"" was O's only good line), but libertarians have a very long road ahead of them - a few presidential terms of total Republican dominance might be a prerequisite.  This is exactly what I hope the ""lesser evil"" ticket of Romney / Ryan will accomplish.  I'm still voting for Gary Johnson, but only because I'm in ""solid-blue state"" that isn't even close..."
,nikita566,2012-10-04T19:11Z,"Thanks for the effort, but why upload a video with no sound in the beginning? Other copies online were fine, plus this can be seen for free online on dozens of news sites. I appreciate the upload, but it this case, it's useless."
,extracube,2012-10-04T22:06Z,"A quick note to people, I recommend getting the other copy on TPB which is 550mb (uploaded by anonymous) because it has NO sound issues, unlike several others (this one also has reports of sound problems ?)."
,B0b_D0le,2012-10-05T02:59Z,"Yeah, what extracube wrote, wish I'd read comments first."
,sneakysnake128,2012-10-05T04:58Z,"""Romney was definitely the more honest of the participants.""

To that, I refer you to this article: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/opinion/an-unhelpful-presidential-debate.html

""Virtually every time Mr. Romney spoke, he misrepresented the platform on which he and Paul Ryan are actually running.""

He lies about key issues, such as saying he will not cut taxes when he intends to restore the Bush tax cuts which were meant to be temporary in the first place but which the rich want permanently. He also lies about his health plan including pre-existing conditions. He has no such plan. "
,corbryant,2012-10-05T05:59Z,Thanks a bunch for getting this online so quick.  I tried checking it out on youtube but it was so choppy I couldn't do it.  LOL
