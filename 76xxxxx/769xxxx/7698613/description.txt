Steve Clay Wilson (born July 25, 1941), better known as S. Clay Wilson, is an American underground cartoonist and central figure in the underground comix movement. Wilson attracted attention from readers with aggressively violent and sexually explicit panoramas of lowlife denizens, often depicting the wild escapades of pirates and bikers. He was an early contributor to Zap Comix, and Wilson's artistic audacity has been cited by R. Crumb as a liberating source of inspiration for Crumb's own work.

Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Wilson drew from age 12 and attended the University of Nebraska. Trained as a medic in the United States Army, he held odd jobs before moving to San Francisco in 1968. Wilson lived in Lawrence, Kansas, before moving West.
