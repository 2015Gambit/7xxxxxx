Story:

The story is quite strong this time around, mainly thanks to the villain. Grings Kodai - a media mogul that has visions of the future - has captured Zorua and Zoroark, forcing the mother to use its illusion ability to scare the residents of Crown City away. His goal? To find the Time Ripple; a 'pocket' of time energy that appears upon Celebi's arrival. Celebi, however, has not visited Crown City in 20 years. When Zorua escapes villain's airship and teams up with Ash and the gang to find Zoroark, can they also discover the truth behind Celebi's disappearance and stop Kodai?
