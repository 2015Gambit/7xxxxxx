This is a collection of racialist books, as well as books which while not themselves racialist support those who take race seriously. Authors include Madison Grant, Lothrop Stoddard, Jared Taylor, Kevin MacDonald, Charles Murray, Patrick Buchanan, Wilmot Robertson, Richard Lynn, J. Philippe Rushton, Peter Brimelow, William Luther Pierce, David Duke, George Lincoln Rockwell, Robert S. Griffin, and others.  Two speeches by Tom Sunic are also included.

Those who are willing to look beyond the politically correct orthodoxy on racial questions will find much to ponder here.
