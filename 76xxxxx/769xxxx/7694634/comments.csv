The very concept of 'race' has been completely debunked by anthropologists, so quoting dinosaur racists in defense of racism is like trying to prove that the earth is flat to suit irrational PREJUDICE.
Strictly for stupid rednecks looking for some sort of support for their hatred.

Those who charge that race is an invalid taxonomic construct do so by attacking a strawman definition of race.  Neven Sesardic clarifies the matter here:
