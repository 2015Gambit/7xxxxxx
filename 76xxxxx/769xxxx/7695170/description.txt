This torrent uses the official ISOs provided by one of Microsoft's distributors, Digital River. They are untouched ISOs, so you will still need to either buy a license key or use some sort of crack within 30 days (such as Windows Loader by Daz - http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information)

The torrent uses the webseed module in most torrent clients, meaning it downloads the content from both other bittorrent peers and from a HTTP server, in this case being Digital River's at

I do not think the magnet links here add the webseed URL to them, so if you're not getting a fast download and are using a modern bittorrent client, try adding the webseed address manually:




TL;DR: Burn the ISO, boot it, buy/crack it within 30 days, and you're safe and good to go.

Enjoy and seed please!
