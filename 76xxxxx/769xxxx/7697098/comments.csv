Arigato!"
,simunic,2012-10-05T09:21Z,"Not working for me. Updated through the official patch, then applied this patch; it crashed the same like the global. 

Downloaded and installed the full 13.8 build, then applied the patch. Also crashed.

Uninstalled everything, then installed the latest build and applied the patch. It said the patch had bee applied, same as the last working version. It keeps crashing.

I have Windows 7. Any ideas?"
,simunic,2012-10-05T09:27Z,"Never mind. It worked after I ran CCleaner. Something in the AppData/Roaming folder was messing it up. 

Thanks for the patch. "

,simunic,2012-10-05T09:56Z,"So after it worked, I quit to set a bigger window size. It started crashing again. Then it started loading again, but it asked for the serial key. I typed in 1. Did not accept it. It kept crashing, then suddenly started working again. 

So now it only starts with the default window size :-/."
,willyjinkens,2012-10-05T10:41Z,.. I have no idea why it's acting like that. Is anyone else having that issue? I can't seem to make it crash by messing with it. Have all of the other patches worked for you?
,simunic,2012-10-05T11:35Z,"13.5 worked without a problem. 

With 13.8: 
It crashes during start up--the same way it did with the global--about 4 or 5 times until it actually works. It seems changing the screen resolution makes it crash the next time you try to open it. So I tried fullscreen. It seemed to work. I quit, re-started, then it it continued to crash. It also crashes with the resolution at default. And sometimes when it starts it asks for the serial key.

The patch applied normally. I'm guessing it's probably something at my end."
,lostpl14,2012-10-05T12:24Z,Not working for me too... Game crashes everytime when I try to enter license key... I have a fresh installed version 13.8.30 with default settings... Windows 7...
