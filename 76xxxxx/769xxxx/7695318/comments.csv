,extracube,2012-10-04T22:05Z,By the way!  This one has NO sound problem issues from what I can see.  A real plus because several other copies going around on the net have major problems for the first 2 minutes!  This one does NOT.
,arnoldlayne3,2012-10-04T23:57Z,"Romney kicked his ass.   Looking forward to him doing it again, and again, and then winning on election day.   It will be fun to see Chris Matthews' head explode, too, which I am sure will happen.   "
,extracube,2012-10-05T05:47Z,"Yah, Romney definitely seemed like a man truely on the mission of his life, unfazed by anything around him."
,mpjbay,2012-10-05T09:18Z,"obama clearly won the debate if you are going by actual facts and solutions. 

if you are going by a scary perma grim similar to the joker on batman, no facts, and no details to any plans then yes romney won."

USA's economic freedom and international competetiveness fell under Obama.  USA's current economic problems can all be traced back to the socialistic policies that free market economists had warned about for a very long time, and Obama has made them worse.  If he doesn't even understand the causes of economic problems, how the hell can anyone expect him to fix them?!

Yes, Romney and Ryan use some interpretive spin and obfuscation (though not outright lies) when talking about certain budget specifics.  Romney is a centrist trying to simultaneously appeal to centrists and the GOP base, so vagueness is his best friend at this point.  Romney isn't perfect, but he is the lesser evil over Obama by a lightyear!

Obama's lies are significantly worse, starting with mis-framing the whole economic context.  AudacityOfHypocrisy.com is a place where you can read an ""Obama Laundry List Of Lies"", which are far, far too many for me to go through.  However that site skips one of my favorites: if Obama cared about the poor, he (with a net worth of about $10 million) would not leave his biological brother in Africa in total poverty...  Has history ever known a worse example of hypocrisy?!  What Obama and his top backers are after is power, and welfare statism is just the cover for this racket.

Perhaps Obama deserved to be elected in 2008: because Bush was a lousy president who mismanaged the foreign policy and increased government spending, because McCain was a mumbling idiot who picked an even bigger idiot as VP, and, frankly, because he's ""black"".  USA needed to prove it can elect a ""black"" man to the White House - even one who was a completely unqualified charisma-driven son-of-a-Commie.  And now it's time for Obama to be ""judged by the content of his character"" and his accomplishments - and be replaced by a vastly more qualified and accomplished candidate.  I wish it was someone like (a younger) Ron Paul or Gary Johnson, but, in the meantime, Romney will have to do."
