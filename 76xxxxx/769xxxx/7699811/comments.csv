,renho,2012-10-06T01:01Z,What is an H file
,Drebin99,2012-10-06T01:57Z,@renho - the first part was an .mkv file so you should be able to get this one to work by adding .mkv to the end of the file.
,da4thmaul,2012-10-06T05:28Z,"@renho If you have VLC, you can just open the file through their. I use VLC to watch everything on my computer, no matter the file type. It hasn't failed to work yet."
