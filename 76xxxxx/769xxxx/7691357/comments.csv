Borderlands 2 Update 3 info:

(COPY from changelog.txt)"
,MacScoots,2012-10-03T16:38Z,"Works great, thanks Gh0st, happy 200th.

And to anyone that can't get it to work, it might be because this is NOT a cumulative update.  You will need update 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 before installing this one.  They ""fix"" very little, and you only really need this if you're playing lan with legit copies."
,raze18,2012-10-03T18:05Z,can you play online coop with this patch?
,vargth,2012-10-03T19:48Z,"@ MacScoots
r u stupid?stop giving advices and next time spend some time reading the nfo that comes with the torrent.""You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this   ÛÛÛ
ÛÛÛ update is featuring all previous updated content"""
,lordofsraam,2012-10-03T20:28Z,"Quick tip for anyone that is getting the ""program has stopped working"" bs:
DONT use the b2launcher.exe
Run the Borderlands2.exe on its own

Your name will be changed to Player but at least the game will run"
,Amythist,2012-10-04T00:01Z,"another way to fix the ""program has stopped responding"" at least that worked for me, was to use the ""SKIDROW"" folder from one of the previous updates"

,Marikhen,2012-10-04T05:37Z,"The crack with this update package is non-functional for people who do not have Steam installed at best and just plain non-functional at worst.  As I don't have Steam on my PC and have no intention of installing it I can't tell which one it is.  All I know is that when I made a similar comment on the first Skidrow update I was informed that it still required Steam.

TBH that one still stumps me.  A crack to bypass Steam that still requires you to have Steam installed in order to play the game?  /facedesk

I don't suppose anyone has suggestions for fooling this crack into thinking I have Steam installed without actually installing that useless (for me) bit of software, do they?"
[V],alexisthebest,2012-10-04T06:01Z,"@MacScoots
I'm pretty sure SKIDROW always allows you to just use the latest update. If you compare all 3 patches, this is the largest one yet, so my guess is that they still have all the fixes from the last patches.

I'm not fond of this update because it changes my name in the lobby, so i went back to update 2.
but for those who have friends who have legit copies (and arent smart enough to disable auto updates [considering you have a pirated copy]) then you'll need this if you want to play with them.

Not a big deal if you arent playing with people with legit copies. Id say just wait for the next one, which is why i didnt upload this"

You can change your player name this way for those who didn't realize. Also

this crack works =D
cheers"
,Olathural,2012-10-04T07:29Z,"@Mariken Its not that big of deal really for steam.. Just install it onto a flash or something, its a rather small amount of disk space, no account with it needed, just need some of the drivers from steam. im not sure which ones.. but its flawless after steam install.. "
,retep998,2012-10-04T15:06Z,"As usual, doesn't work on Windows 8. I know someone released a windows 8 crack before but it was for 1.0.0. If only someone could do the same for 1.0.3 :("
,bafakos76,2012-10-04T18:15Z,thx alot man
,ivory_soul,2012-10-04T22:49Z,Another useless update. When is Gearbox going to actually fix problems?
