,Clloud,2012-10-04T00:48Z,"Thank you once again for doing this.

Do you know if anyone has a ""discography"" of Kenny Marks, Morgan Cryar and David Meece perhaps? I have it all on tapes, and as it would be, I don't have a tape player. Don't laugh, I know I'm giving away my age."

,Phaedron,2012-10-04T10:41Z,"Thanks again! 

I would love to have a discography of Bryan Duncan, Allies and Sweet Comfort Band if you have them.  Big fan of the oldies!"

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-04T17:12Z,"Clloud, I've got a decent amount of both David Meece and Kenny Marks, but only a couple albums for Morgan Cryar.  Just the same, I'll work on all three discographies for you.  :)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-04T17:51Z,"Phaedron, please do a search on both ""Bryan Duncan"" and ""Sweet Comfort Band.""  I've already shared discographies for both.  I will work on one for ""Allies"" for you, and Lord willing, it will be available for you within the next day or so."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-04T20:05Z,"Clloud and Phaedron, your discographies are now being shared.  :)"
