I don't get why you keep creating new PSP torrents when we have yet to get complete seeders for the other games.

Some of your other titles are seeded at least, but is that after a year?"
,MemoryPSP,2012-10-04T22:21Z,@dbrot Im trying my best to seed as much as possible . Other users must seed as well . Everyone has to put in some work. Not just me. But i will seed . Thank you for pointing that out
