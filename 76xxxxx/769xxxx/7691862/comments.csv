,dust45a,2012-10-03T14:34Z,     Is this a DVD rip? video? audio? 
,damek25,2012-10-03T14:35Z,A/V anyone?
,Mellow129,2012-10-03T15:00Z,"looks like standard def quality.
the sound is legit. (not a cam audio)
if a cam is about a 4|4 and a bluray rip is a 10|10 this is about an 8|8.
Extremely watchable in my opinion.
Thanks much UL`er"

I'm only 20 minutes in, and this movie is awful. It's the typical, every bullet has a grenade attached, action movie. All of Dolph Lundgren's lines sound like they're delivered through a booth, half the time his mouth doesn't even line up with the words he's speaking.

Sometimes there's Russian audio, this is expected from an R5, not that big of a deal.

Worth watching if you've got time to kill, otherwise, stay away."
,Freakzo,2012-10-04T08:31Z,"@S3quence That is the point of the movie. It's kind of a parody of any action movie there is. If you take The Expendables for a legit movie that goes for top quality action, you are a fool. Only a fool would do that. On a side note, downloading now and will post back with quality points and whatnot :D"
,KateAtonik,2012-10-04T08:43Z,thanks!

,HamoDude,2012-10-05T04:14Z,"A / 8 = NOT out of sync if you play it with VLC...so if you watch your movies with PS3 sucks to be you.

V / 9 = Quality a little under a proper DVD rip

M = 9 These action legends uses cliches like a BOSS!!

Thanks Hackulus for the upload and to the seeders."

Really good copy, based upon how early it's out. Looks like a clean DVDRip on the bigscreen!

Another great movie with the toughest actors around, definitely buying this on Blu Ray when it's out!

,foreverguitarman,2012-10-05T05:17Z,"Sorry guys, I should of checked eng subs before I posted the link. They work good enough for the non english parts but do not match eng parts  word for word exactly. the translation is off not the sync. I just hate watching a movie and not knowing what the bad guys just said..."
,foreverguitarman,2012-10-05T05:23Z,"Sorry guys, the subs are posted as the right ones, but the translation for the eng speaking parts is off, not out of sync. But hell, I just want to know what the bad guys just said when not speaking english, for that they work!!"
