Wireframes are an effective tool for collecting and presenting functionality, navigation, and content of an application or web site. Attaching annotations or notes to elements or widgets on the wireframe eliminate guesswork and help clarify specific functions. With Axure RP Pro, creating annotated wireframes is fast and effective, allowing you to focus on the design instead of the documentation.

Wireframes: Rapidly design user interfaces in a familiar drag and drop environment with features like snap to grid and zoom.
Sitemap: Create and organize pages in the sitemap.
Widgets: Use ready-made widgets including buttons, form fields, shapes, and dynamic elements. Edit and format them in a familiar environment.
Masters: Create your own reusable design elements like headers and footers. A change to a master is reflected everywhere the master is used.
Annotations and Interactions: Add organized notes, links, and dynamic interactions as you design the wireframe.
