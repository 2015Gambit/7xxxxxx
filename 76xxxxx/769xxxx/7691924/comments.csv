Can someone let me know?
Thanks."

,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-10-04T21:05Z,"Thanks,Akonsharon9.
I'll keep looking for one.Unfortunately,my Ps2 only display colors for NTSC  games.
I'll support the industry by buying the 360 version.I'm not sure Ps2 will have more games ported or developed,which is a crying shame,but that will be it."
