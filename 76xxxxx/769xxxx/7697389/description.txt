I had quite some time looking for this pearl and i found it finally! :D

Now i want to share it with everyone that is interested. These are the separate WAV files of the song "Bohemian Rhapsody" from QUEEN.
Im using it to train mixing skills which is perfect for it.

I found before some files but they were for Audacity and didnt wanted to make all the conversion!

I hope you enjoy it as much as i did!

Leave some feedback on the comments if you feel like, i would appreciate it.

Cheers....
