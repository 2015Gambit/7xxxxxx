The Great British Story: A People's History Season 1
The Great British Story: A People's History is a documentary series presented by Michael Wood. He travels around the country as he explores the United Kingdom's remarkable past, from the perspective of ordinary people. It's wide-ranging, beautifully filmed and a bit sentimental, but also hugely informative and full of good humour. Nobody does this sort of thing better.



5)  Lost Worlds and New Worlds 
As the second half of the series gets under way, he examines how Henry VIII's founding of the Church of England in 1534, followed by the dissolution of the Catholic monasteries, transformed the country's religious landscape, setting the tone for a century of sweeping change. He traces the rise of industry and commerce in Bristol and Scotland, discovers evidence of one of Britain's first black communities, and finds an artefact that sheds light on the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland - before explaining how a radical religious movement in Nottinghamshire laid the foundations for transatlantic migration.
