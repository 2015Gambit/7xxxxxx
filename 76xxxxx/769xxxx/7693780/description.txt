Information
------------------------------

The lncredible Edible Dormouse 
It lives in Britain, but few people have heard of it. It is adorable, but it is a pest. The Romans used to feast on them and some people still do. Diana Rigg narrates a programme on the edible dormouse - an animal that looks like a cross between a squirrel and a hamster, has invaded houses in the Home Counties, destroyed electrics and killed trees... but is protected by law. This film shows the dormouse in its natural English environment where it demonstrates its agility and acrobatic ability by jumping between tree branches in the dark.
