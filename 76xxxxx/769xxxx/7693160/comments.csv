,houyou,2012-10-03T20:43Z,"@dem047 , Note: This game requires XNA to be installed. If you havn't already, install
it from the redist subdir of where you installed the game 	"

,Silvak,2012-10-04T05:00Z,Game works fine for me.  Played up to the first 13 bosses/monsters/whatevers.
,SpookyBlackCatt,2012-10-04T05:56Z,"Yea, this doesnt work for me. Tried everything that I could think of. First it didnt even do anything, now it just pops up Hell yeah has stopped working. Dont know what im doing wrong here."
,SphericalChicken,2012-10-04T06:59Z,"This upload works great as usual with extremezone, thanks by the way!

For those of you who can't get it to start, ensure the you have XNA Framework 4.0 installed, just google it and download. I had the same issue ""Hell Yeah has stopped working"" then I installed XNA and everything works great."
,houyou,2012-10-04T08:26Z,the XNA setup is in the gamefolder -> redist
,hybridce,2012-10-04T14:11Z,"please guys, tell me, why many of you are so retarded? if you were smart enough to make account at piratebay and comment, then you probably can read uploader notes where it says that this game requires XNA to be installed... "
,raiz97,2012-10-04T15:26Z,FIFA 13??
,Mug3tsu,2012-10-04T15:28Z,Thnx Extremezone. Good as always :D
,KoaLARP,2012-10-04T22:41Z,"very weird and quite difficult game.

works perfectly if you install the xna refresh out of the redist folder like itÂ´s suggested.

thanks for the upload."
