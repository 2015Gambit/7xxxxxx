Refeel Radio Show:
hosted by Ellroy
You remember those moments that make it all worth living by how you felt and how in that moment, when space
and time aligned so perfectly that for a very second nothing else mattered, joy, freedom, happiness where the only
feeling. Those moments since birth and till death are forever engraved in our memory.
Those perfect moments of bliss on a dance floor, that perfect track at that exact moment, the enlightenment, the
pure sheer uplifting of the soul, those feelings, only music can provide. And when you are down and everything
around you seems dark and hopeless, you reach for music and you play that same track, calling on your memory
and reviving all your senses, bringing you back to that exact moment, and suddenly life and hope breathes through
you again. That is the power of music, it will always be there when you need to ΓÇ£RefeelΓÇ¥, when you need to feel
yourself again complete with the Universe, dancing at its subtle harmonies.
ΓÇ£RefeelΓÇ¥ has no limits, no genre, only exploration, freedom, a compilation of moments, made by lovers for lovers,
an invitation to travel back in space and in time to capture those moments of freedom, an expression of feelings so
overwhelming that only music could bring them back.
