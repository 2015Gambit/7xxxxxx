This album was recorded at the show on 26th February, and features Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood and Bill Wyman, who in August of that year, would play his last ever show with the Rolling Stones. The touring band included Bobby Keys, Chuck Leavell, Lisa Fischer, Cindy Mizelle, Bernard Fowler, Matt Clifford and the Uptown Horns. The Steel Wheels/ Urban Jungle tour became the highest grossing tour of all time. But itΓÇÖs not just the figures that set this show apart from others, the Rolling Stones revisited songs from their psychedelic period such as ΓÇ£2000 Light Years From HomeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Ruby TuesdayΓÇ¥, with cosmic results. In 2012 Bob Clearmountain applied the mix.
