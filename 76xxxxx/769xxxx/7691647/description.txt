Becky! Internet Mail is the software specifically designed for the Internet e-mail. Since its birth in 1996, we kept improving its functionalities listening to the users' feedback. And it has become one of the most successful shareware e-mail products. Now, we totally renewed the program as Becky! Ver.2. Our main aim for ver.2 is developing more stable, fast, and feature rich program without losing its most important virtue - Ease of use.

Features
ΓÇó You can create multiple mailboxes, of course. Moreover, you can create multiple "profiles" for each mailbox. This feature is especially useful if you use laptop computer. You can switch between several different settings, like "LAN" and dialup, for the same mailbox.
ΓÇó New protocols are supported -- IMAP4rev1 for e-mail and LDAP for the address book.

ΓÇó With unique "Reminder" capability, you will receive e-mail from "you" on scheduled date. You can even schedule sending e-mail messages to someone else. You don't have to remember your friends' birthdays -- Becky! does. :-)
ΓÇó Powerful "Filtering Manager" -- You can sort messages into folders according to the filtering rules. You can define unlimited and/or conditions for one filtering rule.
ΓÇó "Mailing Lists Manager" helps you to organize multiple mailing list subscriptions. You don't have to search past e-mail just to find how to unsubscribe the list.
