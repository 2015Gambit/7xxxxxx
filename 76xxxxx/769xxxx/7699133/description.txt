The Allman Brothers Band
Instant Live 2005
Ford Pavilion @ Montage Mt.
Scranton, PA 8/19/05

Warren rejoined the band with a vengeance at this show, starting with the spirited "Mountain Jam" opener. Jack Pearson was still in the neighborhood, and sits in on three songs. Warren introduces "blues hour" as Jack comes out for a triple-guitar run through "Dimples," "Key To the Highway" and "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl" that stands as one of the highlights of the summer. If you like extended jams, you need to hear these! A righteous "Elizabeth Reed" is another treat from this special night.
