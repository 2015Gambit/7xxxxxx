LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major office suites and available on a variety of platforms. It is free software and therefore free to download, use and distribute. The goal is to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF support and without any copyright assignment requirements. LibreOffice is capable of performing the same tasks as every other office suite, from making calculations to drawing.
