,jcord9194,2012-10-05T23:32Z,Is there any possibility that you might repost Cinderella Diamond Edition Pal Multi language into NTSC format. I tried converting into NTSC but I kept losing the command lines and couldn't use the menue. The BUP files wouldn't convert correctly. It would be greatly appreciated.
