,brianxxx,2012-10-05T02:17Z,"LOL...I was soooo into TES:V then I finished it. Now I have my head deep in Borderlands 2, nearing the end. Very hard to mentally transition from one world to the other and get back into it again! LOL"

,rxanp,2012-10-05T02:58Z,"@brianxxx...

Pandora to Tamriel... I just finished borderlands 2 like an hour before this torrent uploaded... and then I have like 3-4 more days to fool around with hearthfire before its time for Dunwall(Dishonored)!!"
,MaryseDynasty,2012-10-05T03:26Z,"Thanks for this; Really fast download! But sadly, it crashes my game on startup. (Uninstalled and disabled all other non-Bethesda mods)"
,ChewieBacca,2012-10-05T03:30Z,"Anyone know if this will work with a Legit steam copy of Skyrim/Dawnguard, and what the process would be to continue playing?"
,JDFan,2012-10-05T04:30Z,@chewie -- IT should work fine just place the esm and bsa file into yor install folder and be sure to activate the esm in your launcher -- As far as the game is concerned it is just another mod so wouldn't matter if it is a legit Steam version or a cracked game !
,mirkwoodguy1234,2012-10-05T04:33Z,when i start building using the bench nothing appears what do i do ? 
,JDFan,2012-10-05T04:39Z,Just tried opening the esm in the construction kit and it says it is missing the Strings file that should be located in DataStringsHearthFires_english.Strings So this is missing some of the files for the DLC !
,ChewieBacca,2012-10-05T05:10Z,"@JD - Thanks, thats what I thought, just wanted to make sure.  I will most likely buy it next week, however I'm kinda bored and won't have the interwebz while out of town all weekend"
,MaryseDynasty,2012-10-05T05:12Z,"Oh nevermind, just don't rename the 2 files that come with it and it should work. worked for me and my many mods anyhow."
,DreadSire,2012-10-05T05:23Z,Thank you much sir! Works perfect and bloody fast too!
,naypalm,2012-10-05T05:49Z,"Totally at a loss here. Crashes at load. I am using a cracked ES:V, only esm files at load at Skyrim.esm and HearthFires.esm. Am I missing a step?

BTW: wtf is a ""10 archive retrieval"" ??"
,JDFan,2012-10-05T06:19Z,Ignore the above comment about missing things -- the Strings are inside the BSA just the CK was not finding them ( I think the BSA needs to be registered in the config file or as I did unpacked in order to be used by the CK ) - I unpacked the BSA file and it now loads fine in the ck (several error reports but those are pretty normal for this game and the CK !)
,nignug,2012-10-05T09:11Z,"Sims 3:Skyrim?

,Torchlight,2012-10-05T14:02Z,seed please. 0.1kb/s
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-10-05T15:38Z,"""Cracked""? It's a dlc, you don't need a crack for it, lol."
