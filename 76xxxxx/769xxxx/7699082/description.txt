Adele may have only release her new James Bond theme tune 'Skyfall' this morning but it has already topped the iTunes chart.

The track was number one within 10 hours of being released, overtaking Rihanna and One Direction as contenders for this weekend's top spot.

The full single was released at 00:07 BST, after a 90 second clip was apparently leaked online this week.

Adele's number one charting has clearly put an end to any competition between Rihanna and One Direction, who were previously front-runners to top spot.

The London singer recorded the track with a 77-piece orchestra at the iconic Abbey Road studios, and producer Paul Epworth described Adele's performance on the track as 'jawdropping'.

"The initial chords happened quite quickly," Epworth told the BBC earlier this week. "We spent a few months shaping it, tweaking it. A song like this has to have a gravity and dynamic rather than [be] an instant pop song. Hopefully it's got lasting value.

"It's a total honour. Until you're asked to do it and the possibility is put in front of you, you don't realise what pressure comes with it, and the degree of pride in being asked. But then you've got to deliver.

"YouΓÇÖve got to switch off from the pressure and do something that's true to the artist you're working with and to the story. The best Bond songs feel like they're part of the film ΓÇô they're part of the narrative."

Today, October 5, marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No, and thus the James Bond film franchise, and will be celebrated as Global James Bond Day.
