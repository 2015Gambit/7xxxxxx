QG 78 - Gravitational Extremes

The equilateral geometry behind Quantum Gravitation as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The gravitational extremes of singularities, active galaxies and Black holes are examined, proving them to be mathematical misconstructions of GEM pinch processes and geometries.

The seventy-eighth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millenia.
