,geirsv,2012-10-03T12:37Z,How is it possible to have a torrent uploaded 12:29 and 5 minutes later have 240 senders?  Is this real?

Have a read about how the site works. 

To avoid fakes and shite stick to DLing from skull-ed uploaders (either colour) and you'll be fine."

some torrents get uploaded to multiple websites. this was uploaded to other site slong before it was uploaded here on TPB (due to the down time)
thats how it has seeds/peers from before"
