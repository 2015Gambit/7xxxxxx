"Clean-Smelling Pirate"

When a young boy's busy father leaves him at 
the hospital with their Parson Russell Terrier 
in kidney failure, George must tap his softer 
side to help the boy deal with the situation. 
While Dorothy tries to give the case to Doug, 
who is brilliant with kids, George insists that 
he is up for the challenge.
