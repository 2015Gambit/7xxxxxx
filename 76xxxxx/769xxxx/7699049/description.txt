Game: Out of the Park Baseball 13
Version: 13.8.30
Coded: October 05, 2012 by gone of SoN
Type: Patch

Description: Out of the Park Baseball ("OOTP") is the most sophisticated and best-selling baseball simulation game on the planet. Since its inception, OOTP has won numerous awards, including multiple "Sports Game of the Year" awards, en route to becoming the most immersive, realistic, and customizable baseball experience a fan can ask for!

Instructions: I decided to release this patch for a specific version because a few people were having issues with the global patch and if they keep changing the code by 1 or 2 bytes each time then this just seemed easier. Patch method is exactly the same as earlier versions of 13.x. Just update the game as you normally would (either downloading the full new installer or updating through the game itself) and apply this patch to the new and updated exe. The program will create a backup of the OOTP13 exe automatically. If you have any problems please post them in the comment section for this torrent on Piratebay. Feel free to post just to say it worked. The feedback can only help. I think that's all you need to know, this sort of crack is new for me so thanks for giving it a shot.

Notes: (Fixed a crashing issue in Vista / 7 - Thanks to forum members for letting us know about it) This is the last scheduled update for version 13. Hope you all have enjoyed it and we'll see you when version 14 is released.
