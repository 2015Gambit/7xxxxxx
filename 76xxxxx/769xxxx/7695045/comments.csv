,kornspell,2012-10-04T07:38Z,Am I the only one with problems downloading this and The Daily Show? For some reason it never connects to any seeder and the download never actually starts.
,pragmato,2012-10-04T09:47Z,Works for me with befuddeling 0.6 kb/s. Also: Daily Show downloads with 0.1 kb/s. Hence: IT WORKS!

,Xpaxos,2012-10-04T09:57Z,"Tried this one, and it never starts!"
,FUA11,2012-10-04T12:07Z,"tried to preview with vlc @ 97% and it didnt work, although I trust tvteam above all other UL's, this file seems to be fake/corrupted !!! same as the Daily show file !!!"
