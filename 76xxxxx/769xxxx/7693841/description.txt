Movies : Action : Other quality : English, 60mins
Please Note: This film has degraded quality due to a flickering distortion across the upper part of the screen. This distortion is caused by my vid card which does not like this vhs copy. It eases a bit after the first 15mins and the second half is definitely better.

For the die-hard fan who has not seen it! Movie is watchable, audio track unaffected and clear.
