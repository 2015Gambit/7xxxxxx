,The_Good_Guy,2012-10-04T00:30Z,"Having problems playing this w/ VLC. the video will stutter & freeze in several places throughout the movie. The audio will continue playing fine. Frustrating to watch. There is nothing wrong w/ my computer. All my other movies play just fine. There's something wrong w/ the video encoding that causes VLC to have a hard time playing this rip.

I think you're looking for either rottentomatoes.com or even imdb.com - or you could try noonefuckingcareswhatyouthink.org."

,Savre,2012-10-04T08:03Z,"A = 9 V = 6 M = 8 Thnx scene and uploader. My only gripe is the video quality is a bit off imo.

At first you might think this is a bad B movie but this film is actually quite good. 

It has a satisfying ending which is key to any film experience. Some of the chase scenes play out really well and have a sort of realistic approach to them (such as breaking partly through a roof when jumping onto it). Also has a good cast which work well. 

I would recommend this film."

Really enjoyed the movie - recommended. Played perfectly with VLC, no stopping as others reported. Thx for the up!"
,7thSense,2012-10-04T16:43Z,"had no problems with this a/9 v/9 m/7

only idiots compare this to taken. There have been tons of kidnap flicks over the decades. Look at Commando 25 years ago. Stolen has it's own take and plot and lots of suspense and action. Good movie."

The first 12 mins or so are fine, but after that it gets... sticky I suppose is the word. Doesn't quite freeze but neither does it run smoothly at all. The sound quality is fine throughout. The frame rate just doesn't seem to be able to keep up after that. Quite disappointed."
