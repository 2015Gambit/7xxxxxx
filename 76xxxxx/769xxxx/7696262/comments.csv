How many times have you posted the full game already? Five? And you do this with other torrents too. Meaning you reduce the strength of the torrents you stole the content from.

And update three is already out, so this is old anyway. Do you even fucking look before you rape the existing torrents? No. I thought not..."
,Kneph,2012-10-05T04:07Z,Got to with OmniNegro...this torrent just wasnt needed
,TheKneeGrowsKFC,2012-10-05T09:11Z,"Hey OmniNegro, This guy does nothing but make different accounts saying his torrents work and what not. They all contain back door viruses that installs a remote access program that allows him to take control of the infected persons computer. I've been trying to warn people about his torrents but few seem to read the comments section. Is there anyway to report users like this guy whos been doing this shit for the past couple months?"
,OmniNegro,2012-10-05T11:13Z,"There are ways to report scum like this guy, but none of them work. If they did, the media trolls would abuse them to get rid of the quality posters.

Sadly the best we can do is to troll these hardcore asshats and warn everyone away from them.

I have been doing this for years. I will continue until the day I die.

I advice people wanting the content to grab it from a scull and crossbones poster. They will not screw us over like this guy.

By the way, see the number of seeds listed on this torrent? They are mostly fakes. Every torrent this jerk makes is like this. 

His group of media trolls and malware spreaders try to make it look like they have a purpose other than giving malware and collecting information."
