Amnesia
.
 Paul Keller is a minister who has found himself heavily involved in an illicit affair with his son's teacher. Unable to see an end to his deceptive and sinful path, he concocts a scheme to fake his own death. However, his cunning plan goes wry and he is left with no recollection of himself or his former life.
 Ally Sheedy (The Breakfast Club, Short Circuit, War Games), John Savage (The Deer Hunter, Hair, The Thin Red Line), and Sally Kirkland (General Hospital, Bruce Almighty, JFK) star in this film about unholy love and the consequences it can bring about.
