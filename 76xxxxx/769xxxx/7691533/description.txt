=========

Decided to include "short name" and to explain why.
TPB allows only 64 characters in a description and I want the ".avi" part to show.
I also need the first part so people can find it with a search.
So, the ".x264/.XVID" and the end of the show title generally suffers.
I use notepad with a fixed width font to make it easy to calculate.
The actual file you download (unless I'm having "a day" ) will have the full long name.
