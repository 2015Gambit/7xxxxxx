Cloudy with a Chance of Murder

On Beckett's first day back from her
suspension, she and Castle are thrown into
the salacious world of local TV news when
WHNY's veteran weather girl is found dead.
As if navigating an industry full of
backstabbing and ruthless ambition weren't
difficult enough, they have to do it while
hiding their new relationship from their
coworkers
