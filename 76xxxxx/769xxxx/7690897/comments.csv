,JonAndRoid,2012-10-03T23:10Z,"Is this the actual Mac App Store version or is this the stupid windows installer crap i downloaded woths 7gb's of and didnt work...someone please let us know and also the poster should probably update his post as well.. I have a late 11' i7, 8gb ram, intel 3000 512mb macbook pro, should work either way"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-10-04T01:47Z,Which version is better? there are 2
,teh-cheeseman,2012-10-04T01:50Z,I mean which torrent is better? there are two
,JonAndRoid,2012-10-04T02:30Z,"well there is a 7gb one that has WAY more seeders and ive downloaded...but it makes you use a windows file masked by a program that enables windows .exe's on mac and for some reason it wouldnt work on my mac..so thats why im trying to get this and to ask if its from the mac store because a .dmg file just works, drag to Applications and hit open and it plays. Other one was a hassle and you had to install a 3rd party app to make it work...not worth the headache... so if ANYONE can confirm if this is a release from the MAC store I'd appreciate it..."
,teh-cheeseman,2012-10-04T08:54Z,"Just Saying the other torrent has Multiplayer, and this one has the wineskin symbol on the picture so might not be the app store one. I got Black Ops on WIneskin about a year ago, if this is a wineskin version and not the app store this torrent is useless."
,Trasc,2012-10-04T11:21Z,"hope some1 will confirms, this is real deal (whitout wineskin)..but i have downloaded over 3,5gb and tried unrar this one - it will show also 12gb, just like another torrent (.dmg)  so, maybe it is mac app store release :/"
,Turingmachine,2012-10-04T23:14Z,this is a Mac Store version. however multiplayer is not working like it is in the other 12gig version. So you might want to download that one instead. unless you prefer a less fun version like this one here. then go right ahead cause you oh sooooo crazy aren't you.
,Imjusthereforfood,2012-10-05T01:25Z,"This has a VERY slow download rate and the other one just doesn't work. I'm sorry guys, theres no Black Ops Mac torrent :/"
,Turingmachine,2012-10-05T02:34Z,they both work on my 2011 imac 2.5 Ghz i5 AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512MB. not sure what Imjusthereforfood is using.
,BMXS,2012-10-05T06:29Z,guys this does not work on mac its saids so im not sure about the other game about this
,BMXS,2012-10-05T08:25Z,this game does not work so guys dont waste your time downloading this game
,Deltara,2012-10-05T08:44Z,how do you extract it...? its a bunch of 100mb files some work with RAR some don't
