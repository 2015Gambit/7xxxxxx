,kambieb,2012-10-05T20:11Z,which version of the game?
,Protoss01,2012-10-05T20:15Z,v 1.0.3 sorry mi bad i forgot this.
,OmniNegro,2012-10-05T20:16Z,"Borderlands_2_v1.0.35.4707_+_14_Trainer.rar

That screams 1.03 to me. I presume this is for update 3.

I am not touching this though. Cheating with Artmoney is not going to get your PC hijacked like this sort of thing may. Be cautious. Just because your AV may not detect anything, that does *NOT* mean it is clean."
,Protoss01,2012-10-05T20:18Z,v 1.0.3
,Protoss01,2012-10-05T20:21Z,"v1.03 yes!!!!

and until now i dont have any problem, but please comment if you find something bad :)"

,Protoss01,2012-10-06T00:02Z,the other one +16 is better than this one.
