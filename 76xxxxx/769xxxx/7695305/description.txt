I just had to upload something after looking at the so-called "Top 100" songs.

It nearly made me sick to see that there were absolutely no good rock, metal or even

alternative metal songs on that list.

This is for the fans of true music, music that is performed the old fashioned way:

with hard work, cooperation and actual instruments. This isn't some pop music where 

the computer does all the work!

This list is of actually good songs, but is in no way an official cd, 

just some great songs put into a cd format. Enjoy!
