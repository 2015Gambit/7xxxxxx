Rick Cua is an American Christian rock singer, songwriter, bassist, author, and ordained minister. He is a former member of the southern rock band, Outlaws, whom he joined in 1980, but left in 1983 to pursue a full-time career in Christian contemporary music, the year after, wherein he gained popularity throughout most the 1980s as a leather-jacket-wearing rocker with an arena rock sound featuring big, shout-along choruses. Upon signing to Reunion in 1988, his works began to take on a softer, more radio-friendly tone that included "sentimental ballads and pop-rock anthems in the style of Michael Bolton.
