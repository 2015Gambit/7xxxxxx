This is more designed for nursing needs including Nursing implication, high alert medications, plus in-depth high alert and patient safety coverage, life-threatening side effects Drug-drug, drug-food, drug-natural product interactions Pedi, Geri, OB, and Lactation cautions IV Administration.
Physician's Desk Reference is more designed to provide physicians with the full legally mandated information relevant to writing prescriptions.
Hope that helps answer your question."
