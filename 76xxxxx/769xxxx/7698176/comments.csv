Of course this link is in the nfo file, I don't know why it could not have been put where people could see it.  It rates 7.5 at imbd but it appears to be a documentary, not my cup of tea.  I want four people running around killing and destroying everything.

IMDB:-
The modern day Four Horsemen continue to ride roughshod over the people who can least afford it. Crises are converging when governments, religion and mainstream economists have stalled. 23 international thinkers come together and break their silence about how the world really works and why there is still hope in re-establishing a moral and just society. Four Horsemen is free from mainstream media propaganda, doesn't bash bankers, criticize politicians or get involved in conspiracy theories. The film ignites the debate about how we usher a new economic paradigm into the world which, globally, would dramatically improve the quality of life for billions



So if you were thinking you would just download it and get an action or horror film, nah, it ain't.

PS I am not picking on their good work, TvTeam upload some good stuff and in good quality.  Like many other up loaders I trust their work, but a link to IMDB is useful so I and others can go there and check the trailer/details.  Quicker than downloading the sample."
