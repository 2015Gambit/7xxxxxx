The original uploader [endorphinal onof this film gave me permission to upload Messer im Kopf aka Knife in the Head on as many torrent sites in order to get more traffic. He put a lot of effort into it especially the subtitles. Here is a brief comment by him
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have never created a torrent before, but decided I really had to for this film. It's amazing to realise that Messer im Kopf is as good now as it was on release.

AFAIK, this is the first time it's been available with English subtitles. I made a high quality rip from a full ISO and found some subtitles -- eventually. These I edited to correct errors and fix all the timings. My German is not great so excuse any remaining inaccuracies.

Please grab and seed since I won't be able to for long. Anyone at all interested in dramas and the wonderful Bruno Ganz will want this film.

Eventually we might see an official release with proper subtitles, at which time this torrent will not be required.

This release includes a high bitrate video and custom-edited English subtitles.
