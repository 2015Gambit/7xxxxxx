Hanan Bar-Sela is one of the most beloved artists working today in the fields of Klezmer and traditional Jewish soul music. A virtuoso clarinet and saxophone player, his amazing skills and passion have been heard every year at Safed's Annual Klezmer Festival, for which he has acted as General Manager since 1966.
On this marvellous collection, he has gathered three discs worth of the very best that the Klezmer world has to offer, including numerous classic Chassidic and Sabbath melodies. This is wonderful either as an introduction to this world of music, or as a perfect collection for the seasoned veteran.
