,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T13:20Z,This torrent actually completes the download (which TvTeam's torrents didn't today). Has anyone found a working Colbert 2012.10.03 torrent?

,pragmato,2012-10-04T14:15Z,"great audio and video quality here, besides a downloading time under 10 minutes. You made my day, MP4SUX, oh yeah you sure did! Many thanks to you. Keep seeding, people, get this one up."
,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T14:34Z,"Found a Colbert torrent on another site that worked, so I'm sharing the wealth. If you're having problems with the ones from TvTeam, try http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7695901 instead.
It's the same release, just as a new torrent. My UL speed isn't that great, but the torrent should pick up fairly fast."
