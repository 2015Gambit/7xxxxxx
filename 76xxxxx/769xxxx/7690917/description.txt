'Predator Omnibus Vol 2'

Dark Horse Comics, 2008, 360 pages

My comic book OCD really makes me want to throw a 'Restoration' on these. But they're large books to begin with, and truthfully, I really don't care about them all that much. I'm just passing them along because I didn't see them here at TPB, although all, or most, of the material within them is probably in this giant Alien Vs Predator torrent...
