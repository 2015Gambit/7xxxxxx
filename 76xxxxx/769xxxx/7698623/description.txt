There is a Volume One to Minimum Wage, I believe it was a graphic novel. I don't have that. There is an omnibus, collected version of Minimum Wage that was retitled 'Beg the Question'. I don't have that, either. But I do have this ten issue series, and it's really quite good.

Minimum Wage chronicles the trials and tribulations of Rob, a squeamish freelance cartoonist/pornographer, and Sylvia, a beauty salon manager with loftier aspirations, with a supporting cast featuring Jack, an unhappily celibate literary stalker; Max, a lovesick wannabe Lothario; Matt, the Godzilla-collecting, stripper-dating rich kid in denial; Maddie, Sylvia's lesbian old flame; Elvis, the mordant and very corpulent smut editor; and others.
