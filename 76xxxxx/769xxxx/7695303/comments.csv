,nikita566,2012-10-04T18:33Z,"Thank you very much for this and other downloads. Just some (unasked for) advice. Make smaller file sizes. No need for 3 GB for a video like this. I understand for a football game or HD movie, but it takes too long to download this file when a 700 MB file would do just fine. 

Just sayin'.

Thanks again."
