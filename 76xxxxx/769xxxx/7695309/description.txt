Moyers & Company presents ΓÇ£United States of ALEC,ΓÇ¥ a report on the most influential corporate-funded political force most of America has never heard of ΓÇö ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council. A national consortium of state politicians and powerful corporations, ALEC presents itself as a ΓÇ£nonpartisan public-private partnershipΓÇ¥. But behind that mantra lies a vast network of corporate lobbying and political action aimed to increase corporate profits at public expense without public knowledge.

Using interviews, documents, and field reporting, the episode explores ALECΓÇÖs self-serving machine at work, acting in a way one Wisconsin politician describes as ΓÇ£a corporate dating service for lonely legislators and corporate special interests.ΓÇ¥

In state houses around the country, hundreds of pieces of boilerplate ALEC legislation are proposed or enacted that would, among other things, dilute collective bargaining rights, make it harder for some Americans to vote, and limit corporate liability for harm caused to consumers ΓÇö each accomplished without the public ever knowing whoΓÇÖs behind it.

ΓÇ£All of us here are very familiar with ALEC and the influence that ALEC has with many of the [legislative] members,ΓÇ¥ says Arizona State Senator Steve Farley. ΓÇ£Corporations have the right to present their arguments, but they donΓÇÖt have the right to do it secretly.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£United States of ALECΓÇ¥ is a collaboration between Okapi Productions, LLC and the Schumann Media Center, headed by Bill Moyers, which supports independent journalism and public watchdogs including the Center for Media and Democracy, whose investigators are featured in the report.

Also on the Moyers & Company broadcast, master media decoder Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of PennsylvaniaΓÇÖs Annenberg Public Policy Center and founder of FactCheck.org, joins Bill to discuss a recent Annenberg Center report that reveals widespread ignorance of the presidential candidatesΓÇÖ major policy positions.

The two also view and assess the veracity of Obama and RomneyΓÇÖs recent  TV ads, and talk about the potential impact of upcoming presidential and vice presidential debates.

ΓÇ£WeΓÇÖve been studying presidential debates for a long time as a scholarly community,ΓÇ¥ Jamieson tells Bill. ΓÇ£And to our surprise, we consistently find that those who watch debates, regardless of the level of knowledge they come in with, come out with more accurate knowledge as a general group.ΓÇ¥
