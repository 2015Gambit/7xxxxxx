Encode:
sorry guys for the wait time, thought bluray would follow after dvd
and waited for it, but somehow bluray date is in 2 months
so its still possible this is a dvdscr
could be wrong, either way i am happy to have it
so here is my rip from the dvd till then

wasnt happy with colouring, so fixed that. Also
added brightness,sharpness,fixed rgb and denoise
got very nice
enjoy
