,Rmk82,2012-10-05T00:33Z,"No, this is not great quality. It is watchable tho. Looks like it has been cropped, i don't know, but it feels like it. Audio Crackles when high noises like screams and so on.

V=7
A=5
M=1

I have been waiting for this movie for some time, but it turned out to be a B movie. In my opinion, it really stinks.

Thanks to the UL tho."
