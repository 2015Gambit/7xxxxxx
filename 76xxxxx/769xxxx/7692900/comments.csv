,calicu_gno,2012-10-04T19:46Z,"Can I burn .avi and .mp4 files to a DVD-R that can play in a DVD player with this program?
I have Nero 10..and it will not let me use this feature because it knows I have a hacked version and it tells me to purchase.
I usually burn ISO discs and play them on my xbox or ps3 but I want to watch on DVD player."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-10-05T05:50Z,"@ calicu_gno If all you want to do is convert  avi and mp4 to dvd  get convertxtodvd , much easier and I think it's only about 100mb  instead of this bloatware . "
