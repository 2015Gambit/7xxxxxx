,ArkAngel666,2012-10-05T08:39Z,I don't mean to sound ungrateful... but there is a serious problem with the way I'm assuming this episode was encoded? When something moves too fast there is a really noticeable and annoying jerking of the pixels moving back and forth and it's almost like a super fast but super slow ghosting... I don't know. But perhaps a tweaking of the encoder or your source is in order?
