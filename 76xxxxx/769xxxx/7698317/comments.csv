The two script files, located in the General Library/Scripts folder, once activated by the terminal commands work fine on my MacBookPro running Mountain Lion. Also on a MacBookAir running Lion, and on an iMac running Snow Leopard as well. As I have created them on my MacBookPro, and transported a copy of them afterward to the other computers by way of a thumb drive, I wonder if through updoading them unzipped their properties might not get corrupted. For the commands in the Terminal, when the right scripts in the right folder, work necessarily. "

Stop downloading that. I have downloaded my own torrent on another MacBookPro, dragged the script files to the Library/Scripts folder and activated the commands in the Terminal. Result : failure. The start-up chime stays as loud as before. Then, by way of an USB thumb drive, I have transferred the same script files at root from my computer to this new computer and changed the files in the Script folder. The Terminal command being activated, no other thing to do. On re-starting, the chime is muted this time. In consequence, the properties of the script files got corrupted through uploading. 

I start another torrent, this time uploading a zipped folder. I hope it will work!"
