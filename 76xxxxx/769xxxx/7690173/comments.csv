,Tuckle,2012-10-01T06:36Z,"Curious as to why this 480p version is twice the size of the normal copy (and only a few hundred mb from 720p), and almost 3 times the size of the 480p provided by TvTeam.  If it's due to a higher FPS so be it, but personally I'd prefer a higher resolution with lower fps since the fps difference is negligible.  "
