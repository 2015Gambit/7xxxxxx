I did try that before, run lucky patcher and all did work fine for the 3 first boot-ups, after the 4th android boot the SPB app got busy and was asking to either uninstall or buy from market. I reinstalled it and run lucky patcher again, and same thing happened, I did keep trying but this app is a tough cookie. do it yourself and see what I'm talking about."

IN your torrent you included lucky launcher v2.2.4, but I'll test it with lucky launcher v2.4.4 which is the one I have. I'll check back in a few to report."
