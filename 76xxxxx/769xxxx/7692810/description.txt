Mr. Church reunites the Expendables for what should be an easy paycheck, but when one of their men is murdered on the job, their quest for revenge puts them deep in enemy territory and up against an unexpected threat. 

Sources:

Video: Russian Vob - thx Lumix1

Audio: Line Own - thx DrunkenNinja- High Quality Line as usual
+ Russian 5.1 Track

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1700 2pass
Audio: English AC3 5.1 @448
Sample: yes included
Subs: yes hardcoded for foreign parts only thx m8

Bonus: yes stereo line audio as a single file, fits on my version and on any other straight forward encoded of the dvd
if you dont need the stereo file just deselect in your torrent client or vice versa if you need audio only, whatever you prefer

Encode:

finally a useful source thats worth my while, video itself was ok, slightly dark and bit noise in the video sometimes
added sharpness brightness,contrast,fixed rgb and denoise
for the Audio i didnt take the easy way and i didnt use a already sync line that was out already when i have a hq line myself to use.
so i synced it the way i like it best "lipsync" all through spot on, and entered it afterwards into the russian 5.1 track.
sounds pretty amazing now. not muffled,not too much bass just good
will definately do till bluray comes along
enjoy
