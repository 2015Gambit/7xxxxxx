Light at the Edge of the World
Join celebrated anthropologist Wade Davis as he tracks indigenous cultures, each unique for the preservation of their customs in the face of modernization. As he investigates these people heading towards an uncertain future, Davis highlights a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?


1)  Arctic: Hunters of the Northern Ice 
Witness the effects of global warming in the Arctic, where ice is melting at a rate never seen before by the Inuit people. See how climate change endangers the survival of human cultures and societies. Within a single generation, we may lose half of civilization's intellectual, social, and spiritual legacies. And once a culture is gone, it never returns.

2)  Himalayas: the Science of the Mind 
Travel to the sacred monasteries in Nepal to understand the meaning of Buddhism and its teachings. Meet a monk who is the thirty-third reincarnation of the foremost disciple of Buddha. A lesson on Dharma will take you on a spiritual journey of understanding.

3)  Peru: Sacred Geography 
Take a journey of the spirit in this pilgrimage to the sacred heart of the Andes. In Peru, the descendants of the Inca believe that the land is alive. As long as you live in the shadow of a mountain, it will direct your destiny.

4)  Polynesia: the Wayfinders 
Rediscover the lost story of the ancient Polynesians, who settled ten million square miles of the Pacific by sailing canoes from island to island. After years of decay and denial, can a single sailing canoe from Hawaii restore the pride of the Polynesian culture?
