It's based on Akella version. Akella is a russian publisher, so it is VERY likely to be a russian version of the game, not english. You could try downloading though.

And answering your question if you still gonna download the game - there shouldn't be any compatibility issues. As long as people you are trying to play with have the same version."
,bluejeezy,2012-10-04T00:45Z,does it have cracked dx9.exe?
,theonelenny,2012-10-04T05:47Z,anyway to switch this to english?
,theonelenny,2012-10-04T08:28Z,"game freezes on first loading screen dx9 dx10/11
tried using other cracks to no avail"
,Mestyz,2012-10-04T13:31Z,It's working but it's extremely lagging for me..even in the menu. You can change the language in the SKIDROW.ini
,dahaka47,2012-10-04T14:30Z,It doesn't have a cracked DirectX 9 executable. Only DirectX 10/11. It has been said that DirectX 9 crack is coming later on. But how much later - no idea. I'm waiting for it as well.
