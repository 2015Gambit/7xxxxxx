,whymichael,2012-10-03T15:09Z,Saw this one in the theaters and Chernobyl Diaries goes down as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
,whymichael,2012-10-03T15:15Z,Strange that I just commented on Chernobyl Diaries possibly being the worst movie I have ever seen and then my comment gets pulled??
,Darnko,2012-10-03T16:35Z,hey whymichael  is it still pulling on your comments? I'd call for help or something as that just doesn't sound good at all...

The movie was okay, I guess. It looked like a lot of it was shot on location, which is awesome considering the location. However, you can tell it had a fairly low budget. The only entity you actually see are just some poorly made up humans that just look, for the most part, like normal people with dirty, ripped up clothes.

From the allusions in the beginning and some of the more cutty action scenes, you'd think the monster would be some sort of huge mutant. Nope. It's zombie people. Disappointing ending."
,jayrockskee,2012-10-04T00:37Z,@whymichael: Well thank you for  the brilliant insight anyway. I know I really give two shits from sunday if you like a movie or not. You've made quite the impact here. Hey have you ever fucked yourself? Try it.

,WinkyPirate,2012-10-04T17:10Z,"I am just happy that scene4all take time from his or hers life to share some films. Thank you scene4all, whoever you are."
,whymichael,2012-10-04T17:39Z,"Wow lotta truly simpleminded cunts in here. Gave my opinion on the film as I would want others to do (Rotten Tomatoes 20%...IMDB 5.0) and inbred humps jump down my throat. Odd that it would hurt your gayass feelings.

Nothing better to do girls?"
,end77,2012-10-04T18:28Z,whymichael clearly have not yet watched That's My Kid
,Luciphage,2012-10-04T18:59Z,"NecroFile's spoiler comment should be removed... Totally lame.

Thanx goes to scene4all & sources."
