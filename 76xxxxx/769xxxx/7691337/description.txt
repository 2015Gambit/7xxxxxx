Danger Outside
The program which will make you afraid ever to step out of your front door; proof positive that the most harmless activities can prove potentially fatal. A young man goes to plough a field with a friend and ends up with a mysterious foreign object in his brain. Another is on his way to work and finds himself upside down in a field with nearly two metres of fence post in his stomach. And the simple exercise of hanging up a bird feeder turns in to a living nightmare as a woman impales herself on a one and a half metre pole with a vicious hook on the end. But rescue comes in the form of doctors who perform medical miracles and make giant leaps of faith to remove these objects from their patients.
