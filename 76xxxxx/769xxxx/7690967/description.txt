The book is CLEARLY very political and leans HARD to one side. My posting it is not statement, simply a continued sharing of comic book art, just like the rest of my uploads. I write these words not because I take umbrage with the opinions expressed within the book, but rather, with sincere hopes that we can keep the comments section clean and civil (as that's the way we do things here in TPB comic book sharing community).
