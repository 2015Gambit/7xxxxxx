South Africa Walks with Julia Bradbury 
Having tackled treks across the UK, Julia Bradbury embarks on a grand adventure in South Africa. As the world focuses its attention on the World Cup host nation, Julia sets out on four different walks that explore South Africa's claim to be 'a world in one country'. Television presenter Julia Bradbury (WAINWRIGHT WALKS) explores the stunning landscapes of South Africa; venturing along the world famous Garden Route, the Drakensberg mountain range, the Kruger National Park and the Augrabies Falls.




3)  Kruger 
Having progressed from South African coast to mountains, Julia ups the ante as she prepares to head out on foot in one of the world's most famous game reserves. Call it exhilarating or foolhardy, this is a walking adventure amongst the biggest and most dangerous beasts in Africa. But Julia is well looked after by Jaco, an expert game ranger who proves that the Kruger is far more than just big cats and elephants. This is a unique opportunity to roam freely in one of the world's true wildernesses.
