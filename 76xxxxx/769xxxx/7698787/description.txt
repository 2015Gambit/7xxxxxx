Remove the WAT (Windows Activation Tecnoligy) 

completly, 

u can still recive updates form windows update

of you dont got service pack 1 on windows 7

install it then run this program, or 

just not install sp1 after you have installed it,

because sp1  includes a hidden update for the WAT


Enjoy
