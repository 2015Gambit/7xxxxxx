Since Capcom has no plans to re-release these games from their cult
classic "Mega Man Legends" series, the only way to obtain these
great games is to purchase rare and expensive copies via online
auctions. As a huge fan of the series, I decided to share copies of
these games, ripped from my collection of actual discs, so people
can experience these games for themselves.

This set includes North American and Japanese releases of the
series, including a demo from when the game was still in
development and the elusive "Rockman DASH 2: Episode One" that went
unreleased outside of Japan.

All of these files are in .mdx format, which can be mounted in
DAEMON Tools Lite. You can download this software for free at 
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/. Mounting these files this way allows
one to play these games in a PlayStation emulator.

Here's the part where I tell you, "If you enjoy these games, please
consider purchasing them." However, Capcom doesn't seem interested
in making money from this series. Feel free to tell Capcom how you
feel about that, and support the series by seeding this torrent and
sharing these fantastic games with others.
