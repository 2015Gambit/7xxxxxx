I'm uploading three Terry Pratchett graphic novels, all of which, for whatever reason, vary in quality from a visual standpoint. Honestly, none of them look particularly brilliant, but I never upload anything that I don't think is worth taking the time to view/read, so take my over critical opinions with a grain of salt.

This one sometimes looks really good, sometimes it looks like something is slightly off. Like its a bit out of focus. I'm not sure if this is a product of the art, or possibly the scan, but in general its still good enough to read (particularly if you're a Pratchett fan and haven't read these graphic novels yet).
