Halloween 6 Producer's Cut NTSC DVD5

It's October!  Time to start celebrating!

Here is the infamous "Producer's Cut" of Halloween 6, also known as Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.

It is an NTSC DVD5 that I bought from the Internet many years ago, and still is the best copy that I have found.  The person(s) responsible did a real bang up job on splicing it together, and for what it is, is definitely my preferred version.  It is letterboxed within a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the source of the "Producer's Cut" footage is VHS, so I don't want to read any bullshit comments about the picture quality.  It's the best it could possibly be, so enjoy it.  Donald Pleasence gave a fantastic final performance, and we are owed an official release, to at least pay homage to him.  The DVD contains motion menus, chapter selection, special features, and English and Spanish subtitles.
