classical guitarist known for his broad range of musical interpretations,
ranging from Bach to the Beatles.

This recording pays homage to the late Per-Olof Johnson, the Swedish guitarist
who was Göran Söllscher's teacher and inspiration. Johnson's importance in
stimulating guitar players (and listeners) to explore the rich repertoire of
music for the lute and the vihuela cannot be emphasized enough. ln order to
perform this music as faithfully as possible to (and often straight from) the
original lute tablature, in the 1960s Johnson together with the Swedish
guitar-maker Georg Bolin developed the alto guitar, an eleven-string instrument,
with the six highest strings tuned like a Renaissance lute, five bass strings
tuned diatonically, and a shorter string length than the classical guitar's. For
the classical guitarist this instrument unlocks a huge repertoire of attractive
music from the 16th to 18th centuries, as Göran Söllscher demonstrates in his
interpretations on this disc.
