With Lucie's help, Carla lands a job, but one night she meets a man and after a night of lovemaking she finds herself pregnant. Certain her parents will find her if she goes to a doctor, Carla isn't sure what to do until Lucie hatches a plan -- Carla will pose as Lucie, and under German welfare laws they'll be able to get an apartment financed by the state, which they can share along with the baby and Lucie's brother Michael (Benjamin Kramme).
