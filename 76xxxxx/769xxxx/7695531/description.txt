"The Roman Emperor had many titles - one of them was Jesus Christ."
-- Joseph Atwill, author of the book "Caesar's Messiah"


WHAT SHOULD WE BELIEVE?
FICTION... or HISTORY

Through interviews with experts, we learn that Jesus is not a historical figure, the events of Jesus' life were based on a Roman military campaign, his The Bible in Greek supposed second coming refers to a historical event that already occurred, the teachings of Christ came from the ancient pagan mystery schools, and the Gospels were written by a family of Caesars and their supporters who left us documents to prove it. Dissecting the history and literature of this time, the scholars note that the history officially provided by the Church does not hold up to rigorous scrutiny. Much like the ancient era from which Christianity emerged, we are currently on the brink of an immense paradigm shift. Studying this history can help us understand modern-day politics, and give us the much-needed perspective for coming up with solutions to today's problems, in order to create a better world.
