Recommend to you to use VLC player. Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC
Media Player users). Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community
Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic. To reduce the file size, the quality had to be reduced.
Hence Check sample to be sure, if its to your liking. Enjoy!
