,piratebaypbay,2012-10-04T14:43Z,Thanks for uploading this. The youtube version doesn't seem to have the side-by-side shots that show romney's creepy smile while obama speaks.

,AlexLibman,2012-10-04T18:24Z,"I think it is universally acknowledged at this point that Romney wiped the floor with Obama in that debate.  Obama looked like he was looking for a teleprompter the whole time, lol.

Romney was definitely the more honest of the participants.  Both were trying to appeal to the center, and Romney is indeed a centrist.  Obama trying to act moderate should win the Razzie Award.  (Dubya is clearly the Marlon Brando of political fakers, for making everyone believe that he wasn't an irreligious Yale economics egghead.)  Obama was benchmarked as ""the #1 most left-leaning Senator"" prior to his election as POTUS!  He is a son of a frothing-at-the-mouth big-C Communist retard whose ""dreams"" (by his own published admission) he inherited!  He has a lot of plans for his second term, as the result of which USA's economic freedom and international competitiveness would decline far more than it did in his first!

I would have very much preferred to see Ron Paul or Gary Johnson debating Obama (""two trillion that the Pentagon didn't even ask for"" was O's only good line), but libertarians have a very long road ahead of them - a few presidential terms of total Republican dominance might be a prerequisite.  This is exactly what I hope the ""lesser evil"" ticket of Romney / Ryan will accomplish.  I'm still voting for Gary Johnson, but only because I'm in ""solid-blue state"" that isn't even close..."
,moshster,2012-10-04T20:49Z,Romney seemed over confident with his answers. In the way people who are lying are over confident.
