But I'm noticing that the few I accidentally put in Other/Comics are getting way more downloads. So, if you click on my name up above it will lead you to 39 issues of this magazine released between June 2009 and October 2012. Enjoy."

Ya' know, I considered doing exactly that, torrents by year. But in the end I think doing it this way allows the most options for the most people. Trust me when I say its far more of a pain in the ass to upload them this way than it is to download them."
