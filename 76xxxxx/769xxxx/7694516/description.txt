"Amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics" -- Jim Dunnigan

This is one of the most monster of the Monster Games put out in the late 70's. Yes, this is the infamous "Italian spaghetti water rule" game. While the actual game mechanics are reasonably simple, this game is probably the most in-depth one ever published for entertainment.

The rules recommend two 5-man teams, and suggest over 10 hours per turn. You'll be keeping track of every plane and pilot in the theater, and individual truck losses. Using computers will about double the speed of game-turns, so I've included a bunch of spreadsheets. Forget ASL, this game can easily become a way of life.
