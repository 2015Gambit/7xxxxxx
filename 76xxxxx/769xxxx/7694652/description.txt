Dirt Road Anthem by: Colt Ford


Yeah, Iâ™m chilling on a back roads,
Laid back rollin to some George Jones,
Smoke blowin out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
itâ™s got me reminiscing on the good times
sittin turning off my real life, driving that truck
hittin easy street on mud tires
Back in the day Pott farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bon fire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
Where we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll donâ™t know
Man this shit is getting old
Man mind your business watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud ass out
I'm tired of talking ya'll aint listenin
Them old dirt roads is what yaâ™ll missin
Yeah, Iâ™m chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin to some George Jones,
Smoke blowin out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
itâ™s got me reminiscing on the good times
sittin turning off my real life, driving that truck
hittin easy street on mud tires
I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
We like cornbread and biscuits
If itâ™s broke round here we fix it
See I can take yaâ™ll where you need to go
Down to my hood and back in them woods
We do it different round here thatâ™s right
And we sho do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road wit a truck and four wheel
Jump on in tell yo friends
And we'll be raising hell where the black top ends
Yeah, Iâ™m chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin to some George Jones,
Smoke blowin out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
itâ™s got me reminiscing on the good times
sittin turning off my real life, driving that truck
hittin easy street on mud tires
