,hollisb,2012-10-04T21:02Z,"Downloading now, there is a small part of me that thinks that this is a virus, I will let you all know when it's done. Let's hope its NOT a virus."
,Jagader,2012-10-04T21:17Z,Have steam with games on it spreading botnet by torrent. but you have a skull. but why do you have to have steam... hmmm.
,Pakundo,2012-10-04T21:18Z,"Wait, if I didn't buy the game, and if it doesn't have proper LAN support, then there isn't a way to play this online, right?
And since this is more or less a multiplayer only game, it's kind of pointless to have a torrent of it..."
,bendive,2012-10-04T21:49Z,"hollisb:
Please do tell how it works after you've downloaded it.

Is this multilayer? Been waiting for this game to appear on tpb, but i guess it's useless if this isn't online-play"
,ChiliNoMoreX,2012-10-04T21:58Z,"so many retards at once...
since you're all pretty much braindead i'll read it for you:

1. Install the game by running setup.exe 
2. Wait for the Crack.

and yes, it's mp focused, but not sure if it has any sp mode."
,Jarekk81,2012-10-04T22:13Z,"Unless iam doing something wrong, it isn`t working with the steam. A bit of shame, as its going to be a good title I guess. Maybe working crack will do the trick. At the moment game won`t start"
,anghellicworship,2012-10-04T22:19Z,this game is kinda like mount and blade so it is not pointless no game is ONLY ONLINE you are a fool to even say that
,Catwalker86,2012-10-04T22:22Z,"I can't get the game to even start.

I've download the game
Installed it
Copy the Steam content to my Steam folder
Started the game, the computer searched for a few second and... nothing.
Try to start up Steam first and the run the game, nothing happens...

Maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Anyway ""thumbs up"" HeroMaster for doing the first attempt to upload this game =D"
,popino01,2012-10-04T22:48Z,"@anghellicworship Have you actually read anything about this game? It's only multiplayer, there's no single-player."
,nightvol,2012-10-04T23:37Z,"I would not play this game even if it was free. I was part of the Beta testing and I hardly enjoyed myself. 
Shooting virtual guns is one thing, but wielding virtual swords just doesn't feel right. "
,neger,2012-10-05T00:05Z,"http://www.ign.com/games/war-of-the-roses-140577/pc-115849

There is a singleplayer campaign."
,popino01,2012-10-05T01:16Z,It only has a training mode but no campaign.
,neger,2012-10-05T02:27Z,"""War of the Roses features both online multiplayer and a deep single-player campaign."""
,popino01,2012-10-05T03:14Z,"Play the game, and than comment about campaign."
,devildoff,2012-10-05T05:39Z,This game has no Single Player campaign other then just the tutorials . It's purely a MP game .
,Aeris50,2012-10-05T06:37Z,"maybe this is wrong game, i'll try it, but i'll wait for SKIDROW too"
