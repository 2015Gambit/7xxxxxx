I'm uploading three Terry Pratchett graphic novels, all of which, for whatever reason, vary in quality from a visual standpoint. Honestly, none of them look particularly brilliant, but I never upload anything that I don't think is worth taking the time to view/read, so take my over critical opinions with a grain of salt.

This one, I would say, is decent enough. It looks pretty good at regular comic book page size, or maybe one size larger. At that point if you're viewing on a large monitor it will start to loose a bit of sharpness.
