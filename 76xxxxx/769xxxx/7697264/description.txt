Rivers and Life 
Celebrating the ever-changing nature of our relationship with the Earth's amazing water systems, Rivers and Life reveals how the cultures and lives of millions of ordinary people are shaped by the magnificent waters they live along. River-by-river, we explore six of the world's most iconic watercourses, tracing their routes, their histories and their changing lives, telling the compelling stories of the life that's lived along their banks. We encounter indigenous communities who dwell in harmony with rivers; modern traders, artists and artisans who make their living there; and vast metropolises which - now more than ever - depend on 21st century technologies to keep the ancient waters at bay.




3)  Ganges 
The Ganges is the most spiritually revered river on Earth. For Hindus, Mother Ganga is a sacred spirit to be worshipped. It rises in an ice-cave in the Himalayas and empties into the Bay of Bengal. The holy river is a source of cleansing for sins, a place of purification. But the Ganges has become so badly polluted that it is dangerous to bathe in it let alone to drink from it.
