Plot: Escape was impossible until it was cleared; a game over would mean an actual ┬½death┬╗ΓÇò.
Without knowing the ┬½truth┬╗ of the mysterious next generation MMO, ┬½Sword Art Online┬╗ (SAO), approximately ten thousand users logged in together, opening the curtains to this cruel death battle.
Participating alone in SAO, protagonist Kirito had promptly accepted the ┬½truth┬╗ of this MMO.
And in the game world, a gigantic floating castle named ┬½Aincrad┬╗, he distinguished himself as a solo player.
Aiming to clear the game by reaching the highest floor, Kirito riskily continued alone.
Because of a pushy invitation from a female warrior and rapier expert, Asuna, he teamed up with her.
That encounter brought about an opportunity to call out to the fated KiritoΓÇò.
