[T],teslaman,2012-10-04T10:45Z,"LOL! Congrats on receiving the ""Strangest comment ever"" award. If you really didn't know that it started this week, then the basement comment must have been a self description. :P"
,genocide44,2012-10-04T11:00Z,"gabeybaby@ your wrong supernatural started on the 3rd of october not the october 10,your the shithead loser in mommys basement"
,Demon1280,2012-10-04T13:06Z,"Thank you Teslaman for the upload.

I don't have cable tv right now so been using torrents to watch episodes of my favorite shows.
Hulu.com sucks I hate the new hulu site so more shows will be downloaded via torrents.

[T],teslaman,2012-10-04T23:05Z,"You are most welcome Demon1280 and yep, so true about hulu.

genocide44, true, the DIMENSION 720P rip source that I used does have one split second pixelation that I noticed around the 9min mark, but that's common really and doesn't cause nuking unless actual show time was lost. To bad the EVOLVE 6ch audio rip didn't come out first, but I haven't seen it to know if it's flawless either.

Also just to clarify, the ""HQ"" is for comparison to the normal ""old"" 350mb avi which is less than half of video/audio quality/bitrate of mine.

That said, 500+ seeders, wow! Cheers guys, I'm used to seeing much less, lol. So as thanks, I will do a encode of the EVOLVE rip anyways and upload it too if it turns out to be a better rip. :) It won't be an actual PROPER since the scene didn't feel the need for one either. We'll just call it a ""bonus"" for anyone who wants it. :P"
,genocide44,2012-10-05T03:16Z,"teslaman@it even though it was only one second you should have removed the pixelation before you recoded it ,as it ruins the watching quality of a good show regardless of the high bitrate it was done in."
[T],teslaman,2012-10-05T05:52Z,"Here's the optional REPACK: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7697925 No glitches and 5.1 audio. We got lucky this time with EVOLVE putting out a release out of annoyance with DIMENSION's all too common stereo audio. :)

Ah, deleting broadcast glitches is never a good move really. Deleting the frames causes a noticeable skip in audio/video and people would wonder what they missed. If it was a total signal drop instead of a minor 6 frame glitch, then the scene would have put out a PROPER or REPACK. "
