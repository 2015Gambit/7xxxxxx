                           DESCRiPTiON 

 If Channel 4 had a their very own hotel then Gordon Ramsay would be the chef 
 and Mary Portas would take charge of the rooms. Gok Wan would run the bar and 
 be in charge of events while Phil Spencer would be Maitre D'. Christian Jessen 
 would head-up the gym while Kim Woodburn would take on housekeeping. Kirstie 
 Allsopp could be concierge and Katie Piper would be in charge of the spa. The 
 celebrities take charge of a hotel for a week as they train unemployed people 
 who want to prove they are capable of succeeding in the workplace. They have 
 to deal with members of the public at all hours of the day, managing 
 complaints and catering to their needs in the establishment's many facilities. 
 They also compete to see who can raise the most money for a range of 
 employment charities. 
      
                                 Enjoy!
