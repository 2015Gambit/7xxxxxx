,michaelrwatson,2012-10-03T23:21Z,Huh? Isn't this movie in English?? Or is there some foreign dialogue..?
,aquinta,2012-10-04T05:58Z,"you don't understand.  the movie is in english but is not the same as subtitles, he said subtitles.go to google and verify what thats mean.........."
,trace535,2012-10-04T12:22Z,"There is a strange ghosting effect between each frame that's making me nauseous, and any action scene is severely pixelated. This is clearly a single pass encoding job.

HEY ASSHOLE, with Xvid you're supposed to use 2-PASS ENCODING.

That'll teach me to trust something from an uploaded without a green skull."
,michaelrwatson,2012-10-05T02:03Z,"@aquinta: Why would anyone want English subs for an English movie, you retard?

@trace535: THis is a perfect rip, 1-pass or 2, so YOU are the asshole. If there's a problem, it's with your hardware. Maybe your monitor is going bad, or maybe you've got it set to 60Hz or less. Idiot.

In any event, this movie sucks balls."
