---
ItΓÇÖs a case that has captured the nationΓÇÖs attention: Four-month-old Baby Kate vanished in June 2011 and has yet to be found. At the time of her disappearance, her mother, Ariel, accused her boyfriend, the babyΓÇÖs father, Sean, of kidnapping the infant. Sean was tried and convicted of unlawful imprisonment and is currently serving a 10-year sentence, but he has not been charged with KateΓÇÖs kidnapping or death. Could she still be alive? And, does Ariel know more about KateΓÇÖs disappearance than sheΓÇÖs revealing? Ariel sits down with Dr. Phil to ΓÇ£set the record straightΓÇ¥ and attempt to clear any lingering clouds of suspicion that she says surrounds her. What does she believe happened to her baby? Does her recollection of KateΓÇÖs disappearance add up?
