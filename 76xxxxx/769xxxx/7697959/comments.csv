[V],LegendaryAxeman,2012-10-05T11:41Z,"There's no point in complaining to a bot because reading comments is not one of it's functions.

Using Winrar archives eases distribution by email and Usenet so more people can seed a new torrent at the very beginning.  This is useful when a seedbox is under attack or has been taken offline, which apparently happened a few days ago."
