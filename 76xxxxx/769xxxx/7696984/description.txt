"Toby Dammit" segment
Former┬áShakespearean┬áactor Toby Dammit is losing his acting career to alcoholism.
He agrees to work on a film, to be shot in Rome, for which he will be paid with a┬áFerrari.
After helping a little girl find her lost ball, Dammit begins to have unexpected visions
of the girl and the ball. After being given his Ferrari at a movie awards ceremony,
Dammit, drunk, races around the city in his new car. Workers try to get Dammit to stop
at a collapsed bridge across a ravine, but Dammit, intoxicated by a vision of
the little girl (whom he has earlier identified, in a TV interview, as his idea of the Devil)
chooses to make a suicidal attempt to drive across the ravine. Whether or not his car reaches
the other side, Dammit has been decapitated by a thick wire that was stretched before the ravine
on the other side. The Fellini segment features music of┬áNino Rota┬áand "Ruby" by┬áRay Charles,
and is 37 minutes long.
