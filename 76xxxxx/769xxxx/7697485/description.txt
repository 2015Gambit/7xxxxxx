Melissa Harris-Perry; Sunday, September 30, 2012.

Sunday, Melissa and her guests got technical in a number of ways, including an examination of technology in our politics, how early voting is going and will go whether people are voting on paper or using a computer and the upcoming debates. She also took the mess Scott Brown has made for himself with race-baiting Elizabeth Warren to look at race as a social construct. They also discussed sex trafficking and slavery, which also has a disturbing online aspect they explored.

Keep an eye out also for another sterling Footnote, and Melissa's daughter making a cameo! They also invited these folks into #nerdland:

Rick Perry's presidential campaign) discussed the debate Romney would later win.
