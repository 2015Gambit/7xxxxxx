"Pilot"

When Jane Van Veen and Henry Martin, an 
idealistic young couple from the Midwest, 
arrive in New York City, the glamorous center 
of industry and media, they are offered the 
opportunity to manage the historic Drake by its 
wealthy owners, Gavin and Olivia Duran - and 
the seduction begins. Jane, a small town girl 
with big ambitions, always knew she wanted to 
be an architect. Henry, a member of the Mayor's 
staff, is grounded, intelligent and tenacious. 
They are lured by the intoxicating lifestyle of 
New York's wealthy elite. But they soon wonder 
what they've gotten themselves into when they 
unwittingly bump into the dark embrace of the 
building's mysterious supernatural forces which 
endanger the lives of their residents.
