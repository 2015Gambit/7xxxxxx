We Need to Talk About Kevin

Dean re-emerges from Purgatory, but he isnt
alone. He heads straight for Sam, but the
reunion isnt exactly what he thought it
would be. Sam drops everything to join his
brother, but leaving the life he had grown
to enjoy turns out to be harder than he
imagined. Dean and Sam look for Kevin, who
has managed to escape Crowleys grasp, but
things come to a head quickly when Kevin
tells them what it is that Crowley wants.
