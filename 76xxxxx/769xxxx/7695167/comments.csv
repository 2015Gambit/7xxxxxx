Anyways, if you want the webseeded version (you probably do; it's much faster since it downloads off a dedicated server as well as P2P), you should click ""get torrent file"" instead of ""get this torrent"".

If ""get torrent file"" fails for you, download this torrent's hash from the site called ""Torrage"", that should provide you with the webseeded version of the .torrent."

So I made the torrent and deleted the iso off my drive to have the webseed do its job. But I now see everyone stuck at 90% or so, and even if I redownload the iso off the official site and try to verify data it does not gain any progress for some reason. :(

Thus this torrent will not be able to finish downloading. I'm sorry, I will try to reupload a new one that works properly, and hopefully find out why wget/Akamai(the .iso's host) did this to me.."

PLEASE DOWNLOAD FROM THE LINK ABOVE INSTEAD. This torrent is going to be deleted as it does not work. The one above works. Sorry!"
