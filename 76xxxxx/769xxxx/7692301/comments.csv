Btw - anyone knows why TPB was off fro two days? No official info from TPB Team :("
,Rage18,2012-10-03T17:10Z,Power failure. Follow TPB on twitter and you won't have issues with wondering.

,Toperharrier,2012-10-03T22:45Z,"@Dramat

It was a police raid over some server hosting trackers like tpb. You can get the info in the tpb official twitter when the web is down. It uses to be very updated."

,obliveron,2012-10-05T06:55Z,the tpb outage was a combo of the 2. power outage and a raid. face book has the info if you dont use twitter. of course there is the whole internet thing your already using. google is more helpful than random commenter s. also EZ uploads even semi popular pc games as soon as they are properly cracked and movies the day the dvd is released in a english speaking country so asking for things that arent out on dvd is a waste of time. try googling the dvd release date if you want to know when something will be posted. also much love EZ and TPB. keep fighting the good fight. as TPB should have seen from the petition thing all the regulars love you all.
