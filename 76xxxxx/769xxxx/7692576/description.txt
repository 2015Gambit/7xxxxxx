 M[color=red]orGoTH's MP3Releaser v3.5.0, dated: Sun, 23.09.2012, get it as exe bundle (805 kB). originally created by MorGoTH in 1998 when only a few knew what this tool has a use for, he has given the sources to us awhile ago and we did some fixes and added some features in the meantime (since 2004, but distributed it in a very, very private way :)
 so this tool has been developed to be actually a MP3/MPC/OGG/fLaC-Releaser. if you find bugs or need new features don't hesitate to contact us![/color]
