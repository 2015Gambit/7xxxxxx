WORKING NOTE: Previous release by other team isn't patched timebomb.

LiquidSonics' Reverberate is a highly efficient convolution audio processor offering true zero-latency operation for two separate, stereo impulse responses. Reverberate seeks to provide a richer and more dynamic sounding reverb from impulse responses by optionally modulating an amalgamation of two, separately controllable IRs using an LFO.

Reverberate provides a rich and dynamic reverb from impulse responses by modulating an amalgamation of two, separately controllable true stereo IRs using an LFO. Further modulation is possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus and delay unit provide a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype paragraphic equaliser is provided with dual LFOs. These features make for a livelier, more creative sound than typically associated with some convolution reverbs.

In addition to loading impulse responses from audio files Reverberate is able to generate supplementary independent early reflections and tails for additional control over a roomΓÇÖs sonic characteristics.

Changelog:

- All: Bugfix for IR2 early reflections module.

INSTALLATION:

  ΓÇó  Unistall any previus versions

  ΓÇó  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.

  ΓÇó Install the setup...


              ΓÇó  That's it! Done.

                             enJoy!!!
