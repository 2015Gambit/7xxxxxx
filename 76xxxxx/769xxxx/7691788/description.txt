You get the idea. This basically covers all the Christmas bases for folks who are nuts enough to listen to this crap all December or who need soundtrack materials. It is pretty music, but people overdo it. There are no novelty or celebrity tracks here; these are professional classical groups performing in the classical style. Very Victorian Dickensian England.
