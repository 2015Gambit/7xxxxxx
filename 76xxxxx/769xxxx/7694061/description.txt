Just Cause is an army game which begins with Rico Rodriguez, an operative for an organization known as the Agency, being dropped into a Caribbean tropical island called San Esperito, after being called there by his commanding officer, Tom Sheldon, to help overthrow San Esperito's dictator; Salvador Mendoza, whom the Agency believes to be in possession of weapons of mass destruction.[4] After his arrival, Rico rendezvouses with Sheldon, as well as their partner and fellow agent Maria Kane, and they ally themselves with a faction of guerrilla freedom fighters. Rico assists them in their civil war against Mendoza's corrupt officials, and assists in the liberation of various territories to further destabilize the government's rule over the island.

Eventually, Sheldon discovers that Mendoza does, indeed, have control of WMDs, and with San Esperito so politically unstable, the president is forced to retreat to his private presidential island just off the mainland. Sheldon and Kane fly Rico to the island to kill Mendoza, but he attempts to escape via jet. However, Rico boards the jet and kills Mendoza and his remaining bodyguards, ending his reign over the island.
