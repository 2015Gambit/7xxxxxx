Although traditional texts present isolated algorithms and data structures, they do not provide a unifying structure and offer little guidance on how to appropriately select among them. Furthermore, these texts furnish little, if any, source code and leave many of the more difficult aspects of the implementation as exercises. A fresh alternative to conventional data structures and algorithms books, A Practical Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms using Java presents comprehensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms in a unifying framework with full implementation details. Recognizing that software development is a top-down process, this applications-centered book provides careful guidance to students and practitioners.
