Half Naked & Almost Famous EP

Source: Half Naked & Almost Famous CD EP
Encoded at FLAC level 7
Track indexes were modified to conform to the tracks themselves, therefore the tracks ignore CD-acceptable track lengths.
Gapless playback remains unaffected.


Wild Boy Music Video

Sources: YouTube 1080p FLV & Half Naked & Almost Famous CD EP
MKV Container
(Mostly) Direct stream copy of 1080p H.264 video stream; frames around edit points were re-encoded as keyframes as needed.
The music video has been cut so that only the song audio is utilized.
The FLAC audio from the EP CD was muxed in and re-syncronized as precisely as possible, but the video is poorly synced to begin with.
The video/audio sync is achieved by MKV timecode offsets; the video and audio stream lengths do not match.
