Prager 20121001     03 Go West!

Prager H3: Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. Colonel Allen West, a man of unusually high integrity, 
 is being attacked by the Left for his military service, during which he displayed a true act of heroism.
 A former soldier who served under West calls in to vouch for the character and integrity of the Colonel.
 Yasser Arafat should have been executed, but should Menachem Begin have been executed as well, 
 as a caller suggests?



Prager 20121001     02 The ΓÇ£RΓÇ¥ in S.I.X.H.I.R.B.

Prager H2: Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. Republicans need to fight against charges from the Left that 
 theyΓÇÖre racist, which is a tactic the Left uses to discredit opponents. 
 How do Republicans, especially black, Hispanic and other minority Republicans, fight it?
 These days it seems weΓÇÖre unable to call a lie a lie. What is to be done about that?



Prager 20121001     01 Burying the Lead

Prager H1: Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. Hugo Chavez endorses Obama. 
 U.S. casualties top 2,000 in Afghanistan, yet the media is relatively silent about it.
 Would a Republican receive the same treatment? There are 20 attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East,
 yet thereΓÇÖs not one story in NY Times about it. 
 Mark wonders if we are in danger of losing freedom because of media bias. 
 More scathing news came out on Operation Fast and Furious over the weekend. 
 Why does it take a report on Univision to reveal this information to us? 
 WasnΓÇÖt racism supposed to abate after the election of Obama? Has it?
