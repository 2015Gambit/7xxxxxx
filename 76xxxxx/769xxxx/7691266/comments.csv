That's right, be the 1st to solve my DVDFab issue & I'll post $20 USD to your account via PayPal.

Here's the problem: The entire Licensee column says ""Trial User"" & the Update Expire Time column says ""2012-Oct-08"".

I have been SUCCESSFULLY installing & upgrading DVDFab from ChattChitto for years & NEVER a problem until recently!!!

1) YES I installed the DVDFab as an Administrator.
2) YES I was sure not to run the program after installation.
3) YES I copied & pasted the msvcr90.dll in the correct folder.
4) YES I rebooted the machine.
5) YES the Internet connection was disabled.
6) YES I turned off ""Check for updates.""
7) YES my sytem time & date are correct.
8) YES my ""Sytem Locale Language"" is set to English & YES my System Time is correct!

***After I discovered the problem I used Revo Uninstaller Pro to completely remove all traces of DVDfab & I ALSO used regedit.exe to find even more traces, which I also removed. Then I repeated installation procedure 3 more times!!!

ANYONE up for a challenge & a quick $20?!?"

1) You MUST have an account to post a message.
2) I HAVE been using replies but to no avail.
3) WHY can't I offer $$$? It's MY $$$..."

Why don't you just BUY the software and its license?
Be sensible.

@ChattChitto  as usual  YOU ROCK!! Cheers!!"
