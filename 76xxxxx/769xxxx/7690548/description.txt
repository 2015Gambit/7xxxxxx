TutsPlus - Advanced Digital Painting

Digital paintings are created through a solid technical understanding of Photoshop. As a result, some tutorials spend their time explaining the rules of Photoshop and donΓÇÖt document their creative decision-making process. This 12 lesson course by veteran instructor and concept artist Matt Kohr shows the entire illustration process from line-art to final, focusing on visual problem solving.
While this course will briefly address the tools and commands used, its primary aim is to explain the creative and technical process behind it.
