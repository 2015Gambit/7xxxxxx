Yesterday is an EP by The Beatles released on 4 March 1966 by Parlophone in the UK (catalogue number GEP 8948). It was also released in Portugal and Spain. All four of the tracks also appeared on the Help! album.

The Beatles' 11th EP was released in mono only, and the cover photograph was taken by Robert Whitaker. Unusually for 1966, each Beatle took lead vocals on a song - McCartney on "Yesterday", Starr on "Act Naturally", Harrison on "You Like Me Too Much" and Lennon on "It's Only Love".

Yesterday entered the UK EP chart on 12 March 1966, and from 26 March spent six weeks at number one. In all it remained on the hit parade for 13 weeks. The EP's release happened to coincide with the first publication of John Lennon's comments that The Beatles were "more popular than Jesus Christ".
