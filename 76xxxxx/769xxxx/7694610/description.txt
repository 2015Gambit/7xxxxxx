How to set up the FULL VERSION of Native Instruments Massive:

It's simple. Although each folder is named Native Instruments, it has a directory in brackets, showing where to put it. Due to the incapability of using /s, I used -s, so, instead of [C:/Program Files/], it's [c-program files].
Step 1:
Place the folders into the directories shown in the names.

Step 2:
After you PLACE EACH FOLDER, rename it, but just take out the directory, including the brackets, and the space after the s in Native Instruments.

Step 3 :
When you're done placing all folders, go back to C:/Program Files/Native Instruments/Massive/, and open Massive.exe.

Step 4:
It should work! If not, contact me.
