Information
------------------------------

Helsinki is a city unlike any other: a leader in social policy, an innovator in telecommunications, nearly obsessive in its pursuit of civil organization... and the sauna capital of the world. 150 islands constitute this northern port city, whose air and water are among the purest in Europe. The city center is rife with green space. If that isn┬Æt enough, its free healthcare and education systems are considered the best in the world.
