Episode: Wild Ocean

Each year an unbelievable feeding frenzy takes place in the oceans of
South Africa as billions of sardines migrate up the KwaZulu-Natal Coast.
Wild Ocean captures spectacular breaching whales, feeding sharks,
diving gannets, and massive bait balls inside and up close on the
giant screen. The migration has provided an annual food source for
both life in the sea and the people living along the African shores
for countless generations. The film demonstrates how business,
government, and the local people have joined forces to protect this
invaluable ecological resource. Wild Ocean will delve audiences into
an epic underwater struggle for survival and reveal the economic and
cultural impact the migration has on the coastal communities.
