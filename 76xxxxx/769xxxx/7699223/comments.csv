Im seeing some connected crawling along.. you so need to check your trackers an make sure CCC de one connects 
I see the http:// version of UDP CCC de one is
removed by TPB
I cant paste it as its not allowed but I suggest
if you have udp disabled to add it back in your
tracker list


ALSO IM SEE A FEW HIT AND RUNS! please help seed it to others"
