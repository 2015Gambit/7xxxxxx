,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T17:52Z,We are noticing an issue with either the trackers being blocked on our side or .. something else. We're trying to figure it out so stay tuned here.
,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T18:02Z,"Problem might be solved. Let me know if the download finishes and the patch works please, feedback would be quite good right now!"
,EJK22,2012-10-04T18:57Z,"Got it. Works great.

Where do we send the check?"
,dfsuperstar,2012-10-04T19:10Z,Didn't work for me and it seemed like the same problem with the previous patch.  Game would crash after the patch was applied.
,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T19:13Z,dfsuperstar - You sure you're updated to 13.7.29? 
,dfsuperstar,2012-10-04T19:39Z,I uninstalled and reinstalled and got it to work... Really wierd how this ended up working
,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T20:28Z,I'm not sure why you had to uninstall it but I'm glad it worked.
,dfsuperstar,2012-10-04T21:18Z,"ya reinstalling it made it version 13.8.3 and when I openned it before I even patched it, it worked"
,dfsuperstar,2012-10-04T21:19Z,Thanks!
,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T21:36Z,13.8.3? Game says we are up to date at 13.7.29.
,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T21:49Z,"Nevermind. The site still says that 13.7.29 is up to date but we found 13.8.3 and this patch does work for it. I'll see if it lets me update this page. If not, I'll release it again with the new information."
,willyjinkens,2012-10-04T22:18Z,OOTP 13.8.30 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7697098 (the patch for 13.7.29 works but we figured it would cause less confusion if we released one specifically for the new version anyhow.)
