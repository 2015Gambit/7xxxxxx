[T],iamgreat,2012-10-04T19:44Z,"Well if you click the iTunes link you will see it as ""Doctor Who In America"". They could change it tomorrow.  Having now been informed of the aka i found the BBCA link: http://www.bbcamerica.com/doctor-who/guide/specials/doctor-who-in-the-u-s/

I wondered why none of the usuals got the TV broadcast of it. I guess they thought it was a repeat of the one from last year. TV listings everywhere i looked had it as ""America"" not ""US"".

Not to be confusing but this is also the THIRD documentary special known as ""Doctor Who In America"". In addition to the one on BBCA in April last year there is also one from 1983. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123805/"

I was getting disheartened about this ever showing up, as I actually had no clue this was going to air and I randomly ended up spotting Tennant on BBCA while flipping channels and realized I had utterly missed this. Sadly, it was the tail end of the special while they were discussing Comic-Con.

I happen to collect all these sort of behind-the-scenes shows on my computer, so missing this was really irking me.

You're awesome for providing this. Few seemed to realize it was airing! And it's the first BBCA special to feature Classic Who footage (though the second to feature a Classic Who actor as a commentator--first Peter Davison and now Peter Purves)!"
