With all of the universe to explore, what keeps bringing the Doctor back to 
America? We uncover the Doctor's special relationship with the US, from Daleks 
on the streets of New York to robot gunslingers in the Wild West. The special 
includes behind-the-scenes reports from the Doctor's death in Monument Valley, 
Utah and the Weeping Angels' invasion of Manhattan, and looks back at the 
references to the 50 States in Doctor Who. Doctor Who in America features 
contributions from the current Doctor Matt Smith, the Tenth Doctor David 
Tennant, as well as interviews with John Barrowman (Captain Jack), Arthur 
Darvill (Rory), Noel Clarke (Mickey) and Peter Purves (Steven Taylor), a 
companion of the very First Doctor. 

There is even a little bit on New New New New New New New New New New New New 
New New New York.

This is NOT the same "Doctor Who In America" that was on BBC America on 30 April
2011. There is a particular emphasis on filming of "A Town Called Mercy" and 
"The Angels Take Manhattan", two episodes set in America that are part of the 
7th series from 2012.

Cropping is as usual to the maximum of current footage, excluding the CGI 
opening sequence which has some rather excessive black border padding. Some 
footage from William Hartnel was cropped during production to fit the 16x9
aspect ratio but was padded with black borders on the left & right so as to 
retain more of the original film image.

Unlike the first 4 episodes of season 2 which were produced by BBC America this
episode was produced by BBC Wales. Funny how the US company produces the 
episodes which look at the mainly UK setting & production while the Welsh 
company produces the episode looking at the US setting & production. But it is
still part of season 2 of Doctor Who Best Of Specials.
