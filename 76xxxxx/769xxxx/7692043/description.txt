Cuarteto Machin Vol.1~1930-1932 (Harlequin) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Antonio Machin, the voice on Azpiazu's seminal 1930 "Peanut Vendor," was a bandleader for more than three decades, first in Cuba, then NYC, Paris, then Spain. But his early quartet was not only his best, but one of the finest of all sones groups. This was among the finest bands of Cuba's long-lived Golden Age, with an elegant fire that glows undimmed. Salsa trivia buffs note: Mario Bauza plays trumpet on some of these cuts -- his first recordings.~John Storm Roberts (Allmusic)
