Gnomoria is a sandbox village management game where you help lead a small group of gnomes, who have set out on their own, to thrive into a bustling kingdom! Anything you see can be broken down and rebuilt elsewhere. Craft items, build structures, set traps and dig deep underground in search of precious resources to help your gnomes survive the harsh lands. Build your kingdom and stockpile wealth to attract wandering gnomads to your cause, but be wary of also attracting enemies!

Crash when trying to milk an animal after it's been butchered
Crash with "Shield Wall" and not having a full squad
Crash when looking for a chair
When loading a save, sometimes gnomes would lose track of claimed items and constructions.  This was causing food, beds, etc to be permanently claimed and unusable.

Squad members constantly switching between two kinds of ammo
Squad members not canceling their job when going on guard duty or training
Ranchers fighting over livestock
