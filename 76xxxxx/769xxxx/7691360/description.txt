This definitive resource on using Adobe Photoshop blend modes, features dozens of hands-on examples to give you an edge in technical, personal, and commercial projects

Blend modes are an essential, if somewhat mysterious, tool for photographers and digital artists. They can be used to for a wide range of imaging effects and challenges, such as noise reduction, working with high dynamic range (HDR) images, compositing, graphic design, and digital painting. Although blend modes can be easy to use, they arenΓÇÖt always easy to understand. Scott Valentine translates the technical elements into every day language and demonstrates techniques using real-world examples.

Whether youΓÇÖre a professional or hobbyist, thereΓÇÖs something here for you. Beginning and intermediate users of Photoshop will learn how blend modes work and get up to speed on the most common techniques. The book will also feature power tips and blend mode techniques from industry experts, including Katrin Eismann, Matt Kloskowski, and RC Concepcion. Advanced and technical users will find indispensable references along with powerful enhancements and corrections. More than just a collection of effects and recipes, The Hidden Power of Blend Modes explains why the techniques work and how to tune them for your own specific needs.
