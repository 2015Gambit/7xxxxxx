This torrent is identical to the one that ran until recently at Demonoid (before which from 2007 until 2010 it ran at the now-deceased Tapecity); I'm pleased to see it find a new home here.

*Notes*
Source 1 of this complete "best" version is the excellent FM broadcast I posted to Dime in 2006; it was not complete, and in many places the music was overdubbed by station IDs and the Swiss radio announcer.  Here 2 other sources complete the show, and remove all radio interruptions.  Matching levels on the sources required lowering the levels on the FM sources, and raising the levels on the audience recording (the audience recording levels called for some work, since the crowd clapped throughout some of the songs, and the clapping was *much* louder than most of the music; so I raised the levels of the audience source).

The interviews from the FM broadcasts are not included; Patti was almost entirely overdubbed (in German and Italian, on Source 1 and 3 respectively).

Many thanks to Vineland for Source 3 (and Source 4 which was not used)!
