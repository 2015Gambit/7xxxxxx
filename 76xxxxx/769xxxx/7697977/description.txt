A collection of the most recent episodes of Negativland's live-mix radio show Over the Edge from KPFA. These are the same files that are temporarily hosted at Negativland's website with just a few modifications to the ID3 tags. The album names have been changed from "Live from KPFA [date]" to "Over the Edge 2012," the broadcast date has been moved to the comments, track numbers have been changed from "1" to the episode number for this year, and album art has been added of the Over the Edge logo at http://www.negativland.com/
Each episode is 3 hours long except for "Your Brain is the Devil 4" which is 5.
Descriptions of each episode can be found on their respective show page at http://www.negativland.com/ote/
