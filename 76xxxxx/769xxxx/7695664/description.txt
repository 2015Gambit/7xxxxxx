 The Principles of a Protagonist Bundle

Chicago native Willis Earl Beal came from humble musical beginnings- he began as a street performer of sorts that was prone to leaving homemade novels, artwork and CD-Rs across America to promote his work, suggesting a desire to be heard. Thereafter, he relocated to Albuquerque, NM where he continued his practice of 'gifting' as he simultaneously recorded a set of songs on a discarded karaoke machine that would become Acousmatic Sorcery, his Hot Charity/XL Recordings debut.

ΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿BitTorrent has collaborated with Willis Earl Beal to gift curious listeners with Principles of a Protagonist, the soundtrack to Beal's new short-animated film of the same name. The Bundle exemplifies Beal's desire to be heard on his own terms and demonstrates that- despite all the critical acclaim- his want of gifting music to the world has not changed.
