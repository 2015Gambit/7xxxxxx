Book Description
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a powerful tool that transforms the presentation of a document or a collection of documents, and itΓÇÖs spread to nearly every corner of the WebΓÇöas well as many non-web environments. In this free introduction to Cascade Style Sheets, youΓÇÖll learn how CSS makes it possible for you to completely change the way document elements are presented by a user agent. YouΓÇÖll discover the origins of this specification and how CSS styles work with HTML.

Learn how you can choose style sheets based on the features of a given media type, including desktop screens, web-enabled phones, digital projectors, TVs, Braille devices, print documents, and even various audio renderings of a document.
