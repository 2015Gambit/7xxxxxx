Seems like the people downloading these know more about Discworld and Terry Pratchett (I know him from Good Omens) than I do, so I'm going to upload this batch without much preamble. 

This is an illustrated picture book. It does not have comic book panels or word bubbles. Instead, nearly ever page has at least one illustration and mixed throughout are some two-page wide splash images (that don't line up very well). It looks very solid overall, though. The images are nicely painted and drawn in a style that matches well with the story.
