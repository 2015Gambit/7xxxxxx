As promised...#4 in the series of chronological Django...#3 previously uploaded and 


I'm sure there's at least 1 more somewhere in my messy house.  These recordings are 


from March of 1935 through October 1936.


Coleman Hawkins plays on the first 4 tracks


The sound is as good as it gets unless you can resurrect Django.


Compilation from England...no date of release on the CD....all tracks recorded in


Paris.     EAC/WAV  FLAC     Enjoy
