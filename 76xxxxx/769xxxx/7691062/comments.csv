,critic89,2012-10-04T06:19Z,"good morning sir...can you do LIFE(2007) series season 1 and 2 of your Web-dl in 480p.. i am downloading your season 1 and 2 web-dl 576p..from su since last 2 weeks and have only reached season 1 episode 8 :(because my country's poor bandwidth)
it will be helpful if you do because your size will be then 200mb(480p) from presently 300mb for 576p..
if you can't do..no problem because i know about your past hard disk problem..just tell me..because if you will be doing 480p than i will stop downloading 576p and wait for it..
thank you :)"
