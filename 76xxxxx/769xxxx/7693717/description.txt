Stan Freberg made this collection in 1961. It's a satire of American History, from Columbus through the Revolutionary War.

This is a re-release from the 90's. It includes a few extra seconds within a couple scenes compared to the original release, plus a couple whole scenes added.

MP3 sampled at 256Kbps from CD by iTunes.

This is a re-seed of my earlier post, which seems to have died. I'll try to keep seeding this one for a long time.
