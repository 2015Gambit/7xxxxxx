Storyline:
On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg 

sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging 

and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a 

revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark 

Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success 

leads to both personal and legal complications.
