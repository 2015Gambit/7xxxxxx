"Recovery"

When the body of a missing NCIS 
facilities manager is found four 
months after disappearing on the day 
of the Navy Yard bombings, the NCIS 
team is assigned to investigate the 
strange case for one of their own. 
Meanwhile, the team is required to 
complete mandatory psych evaluations 
with a crisis counselor, and Gibbs 
is most concerned about Abbys 
recurring nightmares since the 
bombing.
