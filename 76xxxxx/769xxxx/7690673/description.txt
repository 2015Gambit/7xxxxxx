           A meeting of minds from Rune Linbaek and the Idjut
           Boys, Meanderthals' Desire Lines is an album that
           takes Balearic disco and draws it into the more
           organic world of live band jams and groove-driven jazz
           club jaunts. The first track, 'Kunst Or Ars' (oh do
           stop sniggering) even throws some steel drumming into
           the equation, adding to a breezy wash of sound that's
           purpose-built-for-summer. Venturing into more
           dancefloor-oriented terrain, 'Andromeda (Prelude To
           The Future)' throws some suitably warm, bulbous bass
           lines in amongst the track's sheeny, phased guitars
           and surfeit of bongos, while the equally uptempo
           'Lasaron Highway' stays faithful to its title, making
           a perfect soundtrack for getting lost on a nighttime
           drive. On a slightly more worrying note, 'Collective
           Fetish' does sound rather too much like it might be
           Alan Titchmarsh's make-out music, regurgitating queasy
           listening guitar licks and meandering, willfully
           lukewarm basslines - it's possibly one pastiche too
           far, but still raises a bit of a chuckle whilst also
           being very well-put together. A worthy side dish for
           anyone who's currently lapping up the new Lindstrom &
           Prins Thomas album...
