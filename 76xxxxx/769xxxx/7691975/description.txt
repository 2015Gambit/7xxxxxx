Dorina Basarab is a dhampirΓÇöhalf-human, half-vampire. Subject to uncontrollable rages, most dhampirs live very short, very violent lives. But so far, Dory has managed to maintain her sanity by unleashing her anger on those demons and vampires who deserve killing...

To find out what was done to herΓÇöand who is behind itΓÇöDory will have to face off with fallen angels, the maddest of mad scientists, and a new breed of vampires that are far worse than undeadΓÇª
