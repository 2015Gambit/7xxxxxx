,black.hat,2012-10-05T06:37Z,"yeah, this is basically stealing from small, independent devs, a small distributor, and some charities...it's just wrong"
,opaleg,2012-10-05T09:27Z,"Not it isn't. You have to pay more than the average to get all the games. They are moving from a cool concept to simply fudging things.

I'm tired of the same old shit on this bundle torrents. Stop talking about stealing. Get off TPB if you have a problem with downloading games from a developer of any kind at all.

You also can't steal something that doesn't exist. Using that logic, they lost trillions of dollars because not every single person in the world hasn't bought the bundle.

They chose a model where you can choose to pay what you want. Some people choose $0.00

Problem? Do something about it other than complaining about ""stealing"" while downloading 10 torrents and browsing with adblockers."
