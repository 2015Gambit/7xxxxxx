Zedd's debut album dropped today via Itunes exclusively. People expecting a full out club stomper might be disappointed as the album contains a variety of styles. The title track 'Clarity' itself is a mellow, radio hit ballad featuring Foxes on vocals. The build up contains a choir with marching drums that breaks down into an epic kinda drop with dreamy vibes. 

The title track track is all I thought that the collab with Ellie Goulding should be. But it appears that Lucky Date had a say in this track called 'Fall Into The Sky', which gives it a little more edge. Probably my favorite on this album if you count out the classic 'Shave It'. Check out all the tracks over at itunes.
