,kornspell,2012-10-04T07:40Z,Am I the only one with problems downloading this and Colbert? For some reason it never connects to any seeder and the download never actually starts.
,Frank525,2012-10-04T07:51Z,I'm having the same problem. The availability is close to zero.
,slidester,2012-10-04T07:59Z,you're not alone. same thing happening to me. resorted to downloading colbert on rlslog
,pragmato,2012-10-04T11:22Z,"pls seed, for everybody is stuck at 95.5%"
,piratepoortstraat,2012-10-04T11:57Z,"Like pragmato said:
pls seed, for everybody is stuck at 95.5%"
,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T12:04Z,I've also been stuck for about 5 hours now. Not sure if more seeders will help - there might be something wrong with the swarm and the torrent itself. I suggest people connect to a different torrent and start over.
,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T13:22Z,"This one works: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7695474/The.Daily.Show.2012.10.03.Sen.Rand.Paul.x264.MP3-LMAO[AVIGUY].av

Has anyone found a working colbert torrent for 2012.10.03?"
,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T13:41Z,"The torrent uploaded by MP4SUX works. Search for ""daily show"". The name of the torrent is ""The.Daily.Show.2012.10.03.Sen.Rand.Paul.x264.MP3-LMAO[AVIGUY].av""

(Btw, my last comment didn't show up. Is it because the comment contained a link?)"
,pragmato,2012-10-04T14:12Z,"link above posted by mogwai79 works just fine, so try out this one if you're still stuck here. Thanks for the advice, pal. =)"
,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T14:32Z,"If you're also trying to download the Colbert Report from 2012.10.03, I just uploaded a torrent that (hopefully) will work.
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7695901
It's the same release as provided by TvTeam, just as a new torrent. My UL speed isn't that great, but hopefully the torrent should pick up fairly fast."
,J3rryKo42O,2012-10-04T17:33Z,"So why the fuck wont this download complete? i walk away for 4 hours which should be WAY more then enough time for this to finish, and its at 95.5 just like everyone else. WHAT THE FUCK."
