Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the explosive Thursday, October 4 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex exposes the covert financial war being waged against Iran, the continued degenerate crimes of the TSA, the contrived conflict between Turkey and Syria and more. 

Alex welcomes former New Mexico Governor and Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election Gary Johnson to discuss his platform, his exclusion from last night's debate and where he sees America headed if one of the two major party candidates is elected.
