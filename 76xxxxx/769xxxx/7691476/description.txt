Photo to Cartoon
 
Photo to Cartoon converts photographs into cartoons with a few clicks. No drawing is required! As Place77's review says, you are able to turn your real life pictures into magnificent cartoons with the least effort possible. Use the resulting cartoons as avatars, to sign emails and letters, make greeting cards and party announcements, or create a unique art gift. A cartoon makes an original and amusing present that even that person who has everything would be happy to get. Photo to Cartoon is also an ideal tool to make custom coloring books from photographs.
