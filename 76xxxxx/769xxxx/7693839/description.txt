 I dream of you
 And it feels like I`m flying
 I think of you when I`m smiling
 I`m lost into your eyes
 I sing our song
 And it feels like we`re dancing
 My broken heart can`t stop resting
 I love but is it wise?

 She`s born to run away
 So sad that she can`t stay
 I wish she gives me one more day
 I kiss my love goodbye
 I hold her one last time
 And suddenly I don`t know why
 Lovers cry?

 Tell me the meaning of being together
 If you keep running forever
 I don`t understand
 Why is the purpose of loving each other
 `Cause every day I keep wonder
 If I see you again

 She`s poor to run away
 So sad that she can`t stay
 I wish she gives me one more day
 I kiss my love goodbye
 I hold her one last time
 And suddenly I don`t know why
 Lovers cry?

 She`s poor to run away
 So sad that she can`t stay
 I wish she gives me one more day
 I kiss my love goodbye
 I hold her one last tïme
 And suddenly I don`t know why
 Lovers cry?

 ...

 You belong to me
 I belong to you
 Fire from my heart
 Burning just for you
 When you're far away
 I'm in love with you
 Feeling that so high
 What can i do

 Fly like you do it
 like you're high
 like you do it 
 like you fly/try
 like you do it
