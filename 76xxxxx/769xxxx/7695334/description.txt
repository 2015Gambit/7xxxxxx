Thrill of The Kill! is the third and final album release for the Toronto-based power trio Hunt. Originally released on the Daffodil Records label near the end of 1982, just shortly before the label folded, Thrill of the Kill! spelled yet another personnel change in the band with founding member and vocalist Brian Gagnon being replaced by Carl Calvert. Over the course of three albums, the band had changed style with each outing and this time it was to a more commercial hard rock sound with anthemic choruses, power drumming, and searing guitar leads. Still popular in Texas where the band had been a favorite since the debut album, the rest of the world ignored Hunt, and without commercial success, the band decided to call it a day. In 1984, Hunt folded with most of the band members retiring from the music business. This release by Unidisc is a straight reissue of the original album at a budget price and contains no bonus tracks.
