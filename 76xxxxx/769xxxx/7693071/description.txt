August 8, 1991, Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA, USA

Union Tour is loved by many. The idea of getting 8 musicians together playing Yes music 
makes some people go over the moon. But to me it's not the best, actually. How can you 
add a second guitar in complexly structured songs such as And You And I and Heart of the 
Sunrise? Or play Your Is No Disgrace with two drummers? It just doesn't work that well, 
in my opinion.

But there are interesting points, of course. Awaken is long, and its interlude is fantastic. 
The solo moments are all good: Steve, Trevor, Rick and Chris can do wonders alone... but 
when they're all together things don't work that well.This is from soundboard, and the quality 
is so good that it's often called Yesshows 1991
