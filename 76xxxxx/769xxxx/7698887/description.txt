II. GENERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES

DRIVER ISSUES

If you are using a nVidia based GeForce video card, download the latest reference drivers from www.nvidia.com.  This will fix the problem with models showing up as all white.

When running Half-Life in OpenGL, you must select '3Dfx Mini Driver' from the drivers list in the Video Options menu if you have a 3Dfx card (Voodoo, Voodoo2, Rush or Banshee).  Choosing the 'Default' driver may severely impact Half-Life's performance.

The Diamond Viper 550 drivers older than 4/2/99 cause the game menus to be drawn incorrectly. Use the drivers from the Nvidia home page (http://www.nvidia.com) dated 2/17/99 or later.

Make sure the most current version of DirectX is installed on your computer. DirectX 6 is the most current version (as of 10/31/98), and it is included on the Half-Life CD in the 'DirectX' folder. 

If you are running a pre-OSR2 release of Windows95, get the OpenGL 1.1 fix in order to run Half-Life in OpenGL mode.  The fix can be found at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/opengl95.exe

Make sure you have installed the most recent drivers for all your hardware before playing Half-Life.

There is only one CD-Key allowed per client for Internet play.  If you are getting a "CD-Key in use error" make sure that there are no other clients connected to any game server using your CD-Key.

"-w #"   sets the video mode width where # is the width in pixels of desired video mode.

"-d3d"  selects the Direct3D engine
"-soft"  selects the Software engine
"-gl"     selects the OpenGL engine
"-gldrv  " selects the GL Driver. The two choices are "Default" and "3dfxgl.dll". 

"-win"  selects windowed mode
"-full"   selects full screen mode

"-gamegauge " runs the demo in Game Gauge mode. This is a benchmark utility that runs through a demo as fast as possible and stores the framerate in the file fps.txt in the Half-Life directory.
