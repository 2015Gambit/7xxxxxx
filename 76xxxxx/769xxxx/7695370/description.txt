This is a college textbook. It's a very popular, well-written, informative and interesting college textbook, but it's a college textbook all the same. Don't want anybody to download it thinking they're getting 576 pages of pretty pictures (although there's plenty of those, as well).



'A World Of Art' (PDF)

Pearson, 6th edition, Oct 2009, 576 pages

Written by Henry Sayre

Henry Sayre wrote the first edition of World of Art  because he wanted to use a text in his own art appreciation course that truly represented all artists, not just the Western canon found at that time in the other texts. He also wanted a text that fostered critical thinking through looking at, talking about, and questioning works of art for his students. We are proud to present the new sixth edition of World of Art, which further strengthens these two key aspects of the text while presenting hot topics like video and time-based media.
