QG 79 - The Dark Forces

The equilateral geometry behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy as developed by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Tetryonic geometry reveals the true field geometry behind the interactive forces of the natural Constants, Virtual Particles, Inflation, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

Highlighting the interplay between these force and Vacuum energies in creating GEM fields that facilitate the evolution of the Universe into a dynamic state of equilibrium

The seventy-ninth chapter in the fourth release of Tetryonics - The charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
