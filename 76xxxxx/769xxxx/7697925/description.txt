NOTE: This is an optional repack. The first DIMENSION 720P source had stereo audio and one minor, 6 frame (0.25sec) pixelation glitch around the 9min mark. Normally we are stuck with those minor issues since they don't warrant a PROPER getting released. However, EVOLVE was kind enough to release an INTERNAL rip this time which has the 5.1 audio. I have also confirmed it is glitch free. Enjoy! :)
