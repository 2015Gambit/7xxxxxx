,glounk,2012-10-04T21:57Z,"where is """"setup.exe"""""
,precursor1188,2012-10-05T08:42Z,What I did was unrar the files into its folder. Open poweriso. select all the files and folders and drag into poweriso. then save as .iso I am not sure if the iso label is important or not. just give the label name as 1220JECP. Then mount iso and you see all the files and folders. Setup.exe is there.
