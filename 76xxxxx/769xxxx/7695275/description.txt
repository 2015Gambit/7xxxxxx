
Book Description :

This new book from the authors of the classic book Numerical Methods addresses the increasingly important role of numerical methods in science and engineering. More cohesive and comprehensive than any other modern textbook in the field, it combines traditional and well-developed topics with other material that is rarely found in numerical analysis texts, such as interval arithmetic, elementary functions, operator series, convergence acceleration, and continued fractions. Although this volume is self-contained, more comprehensive treatments of matrix computations will be given in a forthcoming volume. A supplementary Website contains three appendices: an introduction to matrix computations  a description of Mulprec, a MATLAB┬« multiple precision package  and a guide to literature, algorithms, and software in numerical analysis. Review questions, problems, and computer exercises are also included. For use in an introductory graduate course in numerical analysis and for researchers who use numerical methods in science and engineering.
