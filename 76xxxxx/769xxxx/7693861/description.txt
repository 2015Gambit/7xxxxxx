
Slash with Myles Kennedy DVD torrent,

I created a dvd from the best sources on youtube I could get at the time, most is very good quality, some songs are less.  May not be perfect but looks good to me as I was there, figure I would share for those who want it.

The dvd is complete except for 3 songs that I cannot find, if someone has those tunes and can give me a link I can update the dvd at any time.

The songs missing are listed in red and strike with a [b]*****[/b] beside them in the setlist:

Share ANYWHERE you want as they are not my sources I just put them together, although a little credit to MYGNRFORUM would be nice :)

cheers and enjoy!

Simply save file and open with your bit torrent program

I am using my home connection not my seedbox so expect this to take a bit to get it, you WILL get it though :)
