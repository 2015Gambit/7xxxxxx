From Wiki:


The Proclaimers are a Scottish band composed of identical twin brothers Charlie and Craig Reid. They are probably best known for the songs "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)", "I'm On My Way" and "Letter from America". The band tours extensively throughout Europe and other continents. They have released nine studio albums from 1987 until the present, as well as two compilation albums and a DVD.

In 2011, the band scored history in Scotland when two of their tracks, "Sunshine on Leith" and "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)", were featured on Scotland's Greatest Album (2011).
