From the cover: "At the beginning, there was only the naked Earth. Then, the humans came. This is the amazing tale of the battle for something really, really precious--women!"
It's a prehistoric tale directed by Joe D'Amato featuring hot women and savage men and when they meet the results are so explosive the women drain every bit of dick drool from their cocks. Basically this is a familiar depiction of primitive men and women getting it on, grunting and humping their way through word-less exercise. There's conflict between competing tribes, but basically it's all sex. Starring capable performers from the stock Continental XXX Cast: Roberto Malone, bald and convincingly horny; Gerry Pike as the lead stud, and terrific beauties like Roxanne Hall, Penelope and Laura Palmer.
