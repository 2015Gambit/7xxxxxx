Can anybody explain to me why there are over 1,200 seeders and only 9 connected? Seems counterproductive to choose torrents based on the of number of seeders, and then find out it downloads just as slow as any other with less than 1/10 the number. Please explain as you would to a cave man, or an MPAA executive. Below is a picture of one.
