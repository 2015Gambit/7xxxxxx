Uploader's notes: I've tried my best to preserve this game, currently the ONLY place you can obtain this ISO in PAL is from my computer. I downloaded it beforewent down and had it saved on a flash drive luckily. I decided I'd share it with the world so nobody would have to lose this game. It can be played on Dolphin emulator only, unfortunately it doesn't work for any backup launchers as we know of. If you have a dual-core PC with a decent graphics card you should be able to play this. Currently I have an upload speed of about 500 KBps, now this is decent, but currently I'm the only one seeding. Any seeding you could do for any amount of time would be appreciated, not many people download this game so it wouldn't be too stressful on your part.
