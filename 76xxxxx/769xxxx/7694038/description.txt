As the dragons become more comfortable as a part of Berk society, the livestock
are becoming less comfortable - fire-breathing predators are, after all, around
every corner. As a result, Berk is running low on eggs, milk and other food
supplies. With a heavy winter storm on the way, the kids must train not just
the dragons, but also the livestock, if thereΓÇÖs any hope of surviving the winter.
