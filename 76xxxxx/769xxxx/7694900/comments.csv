I think you've wandered into the wrong room, mate.

This is a friendly place for AVI, just as capable of providing x264 as XVID - can your precious MP4 do that? I didn't think so.

So, you saw it was an AVI file, you saw it was created by AVIGUY and posted by MP4SUX (both are me) and you thought you'd stir things up?

MP4 was a fringe format with specialty web sites for iPod - and then ""The Scene"" mandated MP4 releases only.

You'll note that NOBODY (5% at most) chooses MP4 on purpose - not movies, not when this comes out on DVD. Season one of ""touch"" just came out - in AVI only.

Hold onto your BetaMax tightly, us horse & buggy folks aint done yet!"
