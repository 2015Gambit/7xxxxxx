 In 1947 when the maps of India and Pakistan  
 were being drawn, an oversight ensured that  
 the village of Paglapur didn't find a place  
 in either country. The village had the       
 distinction of housing the largest mental    
 asylum in the region and in the mêlée that   
 ensued during partition, the asylum inmates  
 broke loose, drove away the villagers and    
 established their own republic in Paglapur.  
 And that's how it stayed for the next 60     
 years! While the world outside changed,      
 Paglapur remained isolated, with no          
 electricity, television or sanity. Now,      
 decades after the world forgot this village, 
 a NASA scientist of Indian origin, Agastya   
 and his beautiful wife find themselves on
