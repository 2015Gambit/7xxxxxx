The Magic of Flight places viewers in the cockpit of a Blue Angels
jet aircraft so they can experience the thrill of high performance
flight. Narrated by Tom Selleck, The Magic of Flight shows the path
of flight starting with the Wright Brothers at Kittyhawk in 1903 all
the way through to the supersonic maneuvers of today's aircraft. This
high-energy film affirms the importance of training and skill as it
conveys the pure joy of flight.
