Game description:

In the depths of the ocean and hidden in overgrown stones for years, the
Techs unleash their ultimate power: Geothermal Energy Generation. The most
powerful tool of the future forces the world of 2070 to expand exploration
into the deep blue sea. Becoming the focus of gameplay, underwater plateaus
offer new industries, large production chains, and resources


Features:

Success elevates the Techs to a new level: the Genius population. They
assert themselves even over the ocean's surface. Impressive monuments and
various new buildings strengthen their position

Underwater exploration and exploitation require players to take advantage of
their environment and master a brand-new resource, using diplomacy and trade
as powerful weapons to make their civilizations thrive in this hostile
environment

Bound to islands lost in the deep blue sea, players will have to conquer
remaining stretches of land and dive underwater to create a futuristic
submerged industry to support an expanding economy

To nurture supremacy, players will construct new buildings, erect monuments
open power plants, exploit exclusive energy resources, develop underwater
trading routes, and gain access to a new civilization development stage to
take control of the advanced Genius population

Even though evolution is at the heart of the gameplay, don't underestimate
the environment - beware of devastating natural disasters like tsunamis!
