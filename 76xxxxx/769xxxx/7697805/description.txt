The Black Crowes - She Talks to Angels [promo].VOB


Very HQ rare promo music video from a promo DVD. "She Talks to Angels" is a song by the rock band The Black Crowes. It is the eighth track on their 1990 debut album Shake Your Money Maker and was released as the album's fourth single. The song made it to 30 on the US Hot 100. The song hit number one as a single in 1991 in the US Mainstream Rock charts and number 70 on the UK Singles Chart.

The song is allegedly about a woman who lost a child (one of the "angels" of the title) and who now copes with her pain through the use of illegal drugs. In 2010, Chris Robinson explained in a webisode (part of a promotional internet series for their 2010 Croweology album) that the song is about a goth girl he knew back in Atlanta and that was ΓÇ£into heroinΓÇ¥.

The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in 1989. Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.

After a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart. After the release of a double album, the greatest hits-like and mostly acoustic Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by an ongoing second hiatus.

The band has opened for various rock acts such as Heart, Robert Plant, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Dave Matthews Band, the Grateful Dead, Aerosmith and ZZ Top, and performed live with Jimmy Page and Oasis, among others. The band has sold over 30 million albums, and is listed at number 92 on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock". They were also labeled by Melody Maker as "The Most Rock 'n' Roll Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World" and the readers of Rolling Stone voted them 'Best New American Band' in 1990.
