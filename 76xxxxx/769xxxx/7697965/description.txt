Book Description
Take your web development skills from browser to server with NodeΓÇöand learn how to write fast, highly scalable network applications on this JavaScript-based platform. With this hands-on guide, youΓÇÖll quickly master NodeΓÇÖs core fundamentals, gain experience with several built-in and contributed modules, and learn the differences and parallels between client- and server-side programming.

Get up to speed on NodeΓÇÖs event-driven, asynchronous I/O model for developing data-intensive applications that are frequently accessed but computationally simple. If youΓÇÖre comfortable working with JavaScript, this book provides numerous programming and deployment examples to help you take advantage of server-side development with Node.

- Explore NodeΓÇÖs unique approach to asynchronous development
- Build sample Node applications with the Express framework and Connect middleware
- Use NoSQL solutions such as Redis and MongoDBΓÇöand explore NodeΓÇÖs relational database modules
- Work with PDF files, serve HTML5 media, and create graphics with Canvas
- Set up bidirectional communication between browser and server with WebSockets
- Learn in-depth practices for debugging and testing your applications
- Deploy Node applications in the cloud or on your own system

ΓÇ£Learning Node will make it easy for someone from any programming background to get a grip on Node.js and build amazing projects.ΓÇ¥
