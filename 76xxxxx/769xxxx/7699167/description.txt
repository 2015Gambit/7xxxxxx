Bob Marley & The Wailers
November 13, 1979
Uptown Theater
Chicago, Illinois, USA

No released material - low-gen. audience NTSC DVD video. Mostly close shots of Bob, the video quality is decent for an audience video. The audio is not that good but still acceptable. (Check the screen grabs and audio sample to get an idea of the quality.)
