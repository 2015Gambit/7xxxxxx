Mindsets for Dating online

The goal of this book is simple: to guide ANY guy through the process of picking out the BEST women to chat with, exactly what to say to them, and how to inspire these women to feel enough attraction and comfort to meet in person.

What can YOU do slightly differently than the last 50 guys who tried emailing her that same day?

Be different (in a fun way) without seeming desperate, needy, or creepy.

This book explains and explores the common mistakes men are making dating online AND explains, step-by-step, EXACTLY what to say in order to stand out and get dates.
