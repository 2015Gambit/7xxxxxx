under ""General"" settings I unticked the ""Check for new versions automatically""

under ""DVD/Bluray --- Write"" the ""Writable Media-(DVD5) Size"" I changed the 4300 MB to CUSTOM 4480 MB ! this is the LARGEST yet SAFEST size compatible on every DVD there is... I did so because increasing the size means BETTER movie quality of the ripped DVD to DVD... after years of usage

under ""DVD Copy -Split"" and ""DVD Copy - Customize"" the ""Default CGP"" is set to ""Black Screen"" from the author's default ""DVDFab"" ...as I do not want to remember anything about any software while I watch a movie that was split into 2 DVD-s...I mean the transition screen... maybe Fengtao has an interest...me not at all ;))))"

[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2012-10-05T15:59Z,"It says that ONLY to you pal.. I saw you storming TPB on the latest DVDFab torrents...
I have to assume that you are honest and not interested in any discrediting activity..yet the normal behaviour for someone that has a problem is to post the very fact that you keep having this problem apparently with any cracked DVDFab product...WHICH YOU DIDN'T MENTION HERE AT ALL...SO..WHAT SHOULD I THINK ABOUT YOU ?!? PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES...AND TRY NOT TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING CALLED ""JetsetJoey"" IS TRYING TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM DOWNLOADING THIS...hmmmm
so either you are not being honest or you are selfish...ANYWAY YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD US WHAT YOU TOLD AT CHATTCHITTO DVDFAB RELATED TORRENTS AND THE OTHERS... THAT IS YOU HAVING THE PROBLEM...AND THAT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE YOU !

where did you install it...on the fixed wired phone ?

have you tried it on another computer ?
you have to clean your registry or better reinstall the OS..something is very wrong on your PC"
,JetsetJoey,2012-10-05T16:18Z,"Listen, Pal, I don't doubt that I have something strange going on because I've NEVER had an issue before... & yes I was ""storming TPB"" because I'm pissed off that I can't figure this out!

What do you mean that I didn't mention I keep having a problem with a ""Cracked Version""? I thought that was pretty self evident!

Anyway, this is installed on my desktop PC & the only thing different with this computer is that I'm using a SSD. I DID clean my registry & next I'll reboot into Safe Mode & see if I find something there! Also, I'll try it on a buddy'd computer later!"
