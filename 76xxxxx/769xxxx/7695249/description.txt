At 35, Tripp has an interesting job, a hip car, a passion for sailing, and a great house - trouble is, he lives with his parents. They want him out, so they hire Paula, an &#x22;interventionist,&#x22; who has a formula in these cases: chance encounter, get him to ask her out, involve him in a trauma, meet his friends and get their nod, delay sex, have him teach her something, then launch him. It&#x27;s worked up to now, but this gets complicated when Tripp thinks she&#x27;s getting too serious and one of his pals is attracted to Paula&#x27;s deadpan, semi-alcoholic roommate, who&#x27;s plagued by a mockingbird. Too many secrets may scrub the launch, and what if Paula really likes him? Who can intervene then?
