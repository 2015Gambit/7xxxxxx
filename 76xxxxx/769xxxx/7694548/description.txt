Culled from 3 sessions and released on CD in the Columbia Jazz Masterpieces series 

in 1990   Monk sideman Charlie Rouse displays his awesome chops on tenor.



Charlie Rouse contributed greatly to many of Monk's best recordings.  His main 

influence was Ben (the breather) Webster as is obvious on track #1 but Rouse's 

choice of notes makes his sound distinctively his own.  His embellishments identify

him immediately to the jazz lover.
