[V],LegendaryAxeman,2012-10-04T13:54Z,"I suspect that sceneline [along with scenebalance and TvTeam] were the ones raided at Perquito a few days ago, and their seedboxes and websites are now in somebody else's hands.  I'd stay away from their torrents and websites until we know for sure."
[V],LegendaryAxeman,2012-10-04T15:13Z,"I was able to unrar and watch this, so set Winrar to keep broken files when you unpack it and don't worry about the error messages.

If you are in the U.S. don't hang around after you download it, though, because it may have been made incomplete so somebody could harvest IP addresses and then harass people."
