,xenoFLASH,2012-10-03T17:47Z,"This is how it ends?
Predictable.
Fuck you, marvel."
,comicbookcub,2012-10-03T18:02Z,could someone re-post this don't seem to be able to get the torrent to download.

,GIANNIS511,2012-10-03T19:31Z,"@DByrne291: I think Fury Max 06 hasn't been scanned yet.

@comicbookcub: What do you mean you can't download it?"
,comicbookcub,2012-10-03T20:39Z,magnet links aren't working for me... and it doesn't give me any other option but to download the magnet link... 
,STFmaryville,2012-10-03T22:35Z,Thanks for uploading. I liked this storyline and didn't hate the ending like some people did.
,spideygeek,2012-10-04T00:14Z,"Really good, liked just about everything of this. "
,GIANNIS511,2012-10-04T01:28Z,@comicbookcub: Magnet links are not my fault. The mods at pirate bay decided to have only magnet links in torrents with more than 10 seeders. Maybe you should consider changing your torrent client ;)
