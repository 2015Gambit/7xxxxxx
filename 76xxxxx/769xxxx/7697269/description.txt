1986 compilation of innovative drummer Bill Bruford's collaborations.


Virtuoso assistance from Jeff Berlin (E. bass) and Alan Holdsworth (E. guitar)


Presented here in "HI FI" (FLAC)    Bruford's discography is impressive.  It 


includes work with YES; KING CRIMSON; GENESIS; numerous like-minded musicians. 


Bruford kept breaking new ground. His body of work is reminiscent of jazzmen who


were able to record with many different musicians, as seen fit by their musical


creativity - unemcumbered by stifling record contracts.  Last I heard he's


"retired"....wishing to make room for young talent.  Now that's a classy way to 


say goodbye!
