This is from the rebroadcast on PBS for anyone who has missed this the first time around.                                         																				       I assume that this will not be exactly the same as the BBC broadcast as almost all PBS versions  of all BBC shows are edited. Most BBC dramas are appx. 57 min. long.         											

This was the torrent info from the first airing in 2010:
