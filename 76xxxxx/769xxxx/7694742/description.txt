"We Need to Talk About Kevin"

Dean re-emerges from Purgatory, but he isnt 
alone. He heads straight for Sam, but the 
reunion isnt exactly what he thought it 
would be. Sam drops everything to join his 
brother, but leaving the life he had grown 
to enjoy turns out to be harder than he 
imagined. Dean and Sam look for Kevin, who 
has managed to escape Crowleys grasp, but 
things come to a head quickly when Kevin 
tells them what it is that Crowley wants.

Fuck Grimm, Super is the bee's knees.

Enjoy :)
