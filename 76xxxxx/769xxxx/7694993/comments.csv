,kornspell,2012-10-04T07:39Z,Am I the only one with problems downloading this and The Daily Show? For some reason it never connects to any seeder and the download never actually starts.
,Heave__Ho,2012-10-04T08:04Z,"@kornspell
No, same prob here."
,Xpaxos,2012-10-04T09:56Z,I can connect but it has stalled at about 55%. And it's been there for ages :-(
,pragmato,2012-10-04T11:23Z,yeah: now we're at 95.7 %. GOOOO!
,pragmato,2012-10-04T11:24Z,"sry, I meant 99.7%- but it still sucks^^"
,Ryan_Maiden,2012-10-04T12:37Z,Yeah I'm stuck at 99.7% as well. What's the deal?
,jarrks,2012-10-04T13:29Z,"Weird. All peers are at 99,7 % (me too) and there are no seeders. We need at least one seeder with 100 %."
,pragmato,2012-10-04T13:38Z,"the deal is to inform people, my dear Ryan_Maiden. btw: still stuck at 99.7%, so pls seed =/"
[V],LegendaryAxeman,2012-10-04T13:57Z,"I suspect that sceneline [along with scenebalance and TvTeam] were the ones raided at Perquito a few days ago, and their seedboxes and websites are now in somebody else's hands.  I'd stay away from their torrents and websites until we know for sure."
,Mogwai79,2012-10-04T14:28Z,"I just uploaded a torrent that (hopefully) will work.
If you're having problems with this one, try http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7695901 instead.
It's the same release, just as a new torrent. My UL speed isn't that great, but the torrent should pick up fairly fast."
