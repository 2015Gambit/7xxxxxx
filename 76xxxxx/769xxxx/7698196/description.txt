No Time To Explain is a game about Time Paradoxes, Jetpack Guns and Ribs In People's Eyes.

It's a comedy game featuring great music, voice acting and gameplay that becomes more ridiculous as you go.

So far we've made 2 "Seasons" of the game, which means we released the initial game a year ago, and last december we did a major "Season 2" update for free to all fans.

Right now we lack distribution and if we got on Steam, it'd make sense to continue doing more Seasons for fans.

The game we are submitting contains major improvements over everything we've done -- especially in regards to bug fixes. Unfortunately our initial release had several unforseen bugs which we have now ironed out.
