Notes -
Video wasnt too bad, bit dark in places so needed to be lightend and alot of noise needed cleaning out.. altered colour brightness etc etc.. had a nasty flicker but thats all just about gone now... the line audio was passed to us by a friend :bOW: needed to stretched the audio to fit then make a few cuts to sync...READNFO... reason for this is the line audio was missing around 4 minutes from the end so i had to mash it together with some very nice cam audio.. turned out really well also there are 2 sections of video missing.. around 8-10 seconds each.. no biggy and not at an impoertant bit

enjoy....
