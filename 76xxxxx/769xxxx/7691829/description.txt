This isnt same as the other one that was uploaded earlier. Those were from the Movie Only Disc. These are from BONUS DISC from 3D COLLECTORS EDITION BOXSET. Completely different content. Also note that after countless hours of fu**ing around with the disc decided not to included the TV SPOTS, TRAILERS and some other stuff. Watch them in youtube or something.
