Notes

Was passed vid by a friend so took it on cleaned up a
little and used various filters to get this nice there
is a slight flicker that comes and goes not too bad there
is a few rocky spots hardly worth mentioning but to be
honest we then mux our line which was 4 min short then
was passed the missing piece of cam audio by a friend
so last 4 mins is cam audio all in all not bad at all
