,Azncrook,2012-08-21T16:25Z,"1 little question that bother me, since its the rip from the 3D bluray (left eye remux), does this mean we are missing some part of the screen, does it affect in any way our viewing experience overall, does the video is off angle, not center due to being the left eye, or is it the same shit as a normal rip from a non 3d bluray, enlighten me plz ty :D"
[V],BOZX,2012-08-21T17:06Z,3D Left Has was used as it has higher quality than 2D

,Nickieponken,2012-08-22T16:39Z,"come on guys i've seeded this film 3 times over now, whould be nice to actually get to watch it aswell....

Seed please"
,SkyN3T24,2012-08-22T21:25Z,I think this copy is NUKED or should be cuz I've been paying close attention and there is a Black Bar on the left hand side of the screen that keeps popping up and the dissapearing. I'm running it on VLC on default Aspect Ration with a Quad Core CPU 8GB DDR3 RAM and a 1GB GDDR5 AT Card. Can anyone else confirm this?
,sgcb,2012-08-23T00:28Z,"skyn3t24:

At what times? Mine is partially downloaded now, but I may be able to check... I'm at 74% now but since I have a bad connection, I'd rather not waste time on a potentially borked rip."
,sgcb,2012-08-23T01:11Z,"Yeah, this one definitely has a few vertical black bars off to the left. Some made it into the screenshots even! Trouble is I'm not sure which 1080p rip to go with now... too many to choose from!"
,TaeXD,2012-08-23T03:26Z,There is no 5.1 audio u.u 17gb for what?
,diabloweb,2012-08-23T03:26Z,"download very slow, staff not sharing this, many blood-sucking!"
,SkyN3T24,2012-08-23T04:01Z,"sgcb:

Yea, I though it was just me for a second but this definitely confirms it for: NUKED [Black Vertical bar On the Left Hand  Side appears frequently throughout the entire film]. All the other releases have been using the BLUEBIRD disc as the source EXCEPT WiKi. He apparently HDChina as a source. I'm not sure if its the source that's the problem or the re-encode but I'm gonna download the Wiki version and let everyone know. You can get it here:

,you_are_deluded,2012-08-23T05:59Z,What is the aspect ratio?
,fayatee,2012-08-23T08:00Z,"Just finished downloading. 
Absolute 10/10 Blu-Ray Copy

I can confirm there is a verticle black bar that pops up in different cuts throughout the film on the left hand side. BOZX has uploaded some other 1080p Avengers so I will find out if they are the same."
[V],BOZX,2012-08-23T09:34Z,"This is not nuked.
First the 3D BluRay has 10 times better quality than 2D bluray which is blurry.
And The Black borders on sides you see in some scenes of the 3D version of movie are known as Virtual Floating Windows,to help prevent stereoscopic window violations.
Virtual Floating Windows are a great way to mask stereoscopic window violations, when a subject enters the scene in negative parallax (off the screen, towards the audience). By bringing the perceived location of the screen in front of subject, the violation no longer occurs, as it is acceptable to enter a scene from behind the window, in positive parallax."
,hanamichi189,2012-08-23T12:11Z,Seeders!! Where are you? It's so slow
,Venturai,2012-08-23T12:27Z,"The 3d Blu-ray is 10x better than the 2d, really? So when it finally releases and I'm able to rip a 2d mkv to my htpc, do you recommend just ripping from the 3d disc instead?"
,sgcb,2012-08-23T14:39Z,"BOZX:

Well, I don't understand, therefore it is shit! jkjk"
,peong,2012-08-23T16:33Z,This is not downloading for me.  I'm only seeing 6 seeds when it should be 2300.
[V],DownTYU,2012-08-23T16:56Z,A 3D bluray has two parallel video one is left eye and other eye (Both one top of each other create the illusion of 3D). When they are separated they act just like 2D video. In case of avengers the picture quality of 2D bluray is pretty inferior to the 3D bluray. So they left eye stream was used to create this rip. Thus providing better quality than the 2D 1080p.

,sgcb,2012-08-25T01:56Z,"Well I finally finished downloading this today and watched it. I'm not sure what I would've been missing if I had downloaded a regular bluray rip (or have been able to tell the difference) but this is great quality! Thanks BOZX!

And to tell the truth I didn't even notice the virtual floating (proper name?) as I watched... It really isn't that noticeable if you're not looking for it particularly."
,heshamdalleh,2012-08-25T08:22Z,"Seed Guys,

,redsx,2012-08-26T10:40Z,"Wow, there are a lot of comments about this torrent and quite frankly I'm surprised. I have just finished downloading this myself and have found this to be a near perfect copy I am playing it on my Western Digital TV Live Media Player on a 50"" Plasma and it plays Perfectly in every sense No Black Bars on the left hand side of the Screen Whatsoever, Visual and Audio are Nothing Short of Top Class Quality, I have played this on my computer using a program called MPC STAR and whilst I was playing this I did notice this issue quite a few people have been commenting on, about the Black Bars on the left hand side of the screen, and yes there are Black Bars on the left hand side of the screen which comes and goes, but it was so small that it was no problem for me. [About a 2mm-5mm intrusion on the left hand side of the screen]  And i do not watch entire movies on the computer anyway.
So to Everyone out there who wishes to download this Movie DO NOT HESITATE ,IT PLAYS PERFECTLY AND LOOKS SUPERB!!,The only small negative is the download was a little slow for me,But Who Cares ,It's Free!!
Many Thanks to BOZX For Your Time Consuming Work, Keep up these Brilliant Downloads.

the rest is 1920x800 and have black bars if you dont upscale"
,bajpirat,2012-08-28T19:15Z,"WOW crystal clear video quality. This  download is Blu-ray  at its best!!  On par with Avatar blu-ray quality. Only downside is if you have a standalone blu-ray player this file won't work on it because the Format Profile is set to 5.1.  

Standalone Blu-ray players that have the ability to playback mkv files need the the Format Profile of the said mkv file  set at less than or equal to 4.1.

A small program called H264 Level Editor can fix this for you without any re encoding."
