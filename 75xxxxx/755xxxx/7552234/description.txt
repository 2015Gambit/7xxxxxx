The Scott Horton Show
Monday, 20 Aug 2012

Today was Scott's first day of having his live show carried on the No Agenda stream [noagendastream.com], and it was my first time to listen to his show live.

There was a problem of some kind during the first four minutes or so. I am leaving in my edit a sample of what was being broadcast on the stream while Scott thought he was "on the air." From then on, everything seemed to go smoothly. He played more music than I was expecting to hear. I will be editing most of that out, because the reason I listen to this show is to hear the commentary and interviews.

Scott's guests on today's show were journalist Gareth Porter [ipsnews.net] and Lew Rockwell [lewrockwell.com] -- blogger, podcaster, Chairman of the von Mises Institute and VP of the Center for Libertarian Studies.

Remember, Scott's show is now reduced from three hours to two hours in length, and apparently will be live Monday through Wednesday and on Friday. The timeslot on Thursday is taken by the No Agenda show.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
