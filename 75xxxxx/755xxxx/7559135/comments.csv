Enginehead
Industrial Gothic
Metropol
Metropol A.D.
Elseworlds books (Superman's Metropolis, Batman - Nosferatu, Wonder Woman - Blue Amazon)
And his Doom Patrol run with Rachel Pollack (issues 75-87)

Some of them appeared to be on TPB, but I didn't check to see if they were working because I already have them. If anybody wants any of the above, just drop a comment and I'll seed 'em up.

Also, I'm working on completing Meta4, if anybody could point me towards issues 1, 2, 3 & 5 I'd be most grateful."
