School teacher Ramchandra Sontakke (Nandu Madhav) is fed-up of teaching in a school in a tribal area of Maharashtra called Mhalunge. He longs to get a transfer to a school with more civilized students. In order to impress his senior, who will be visiting the school on Independence Day, he organizes a flag hoisting ceremony and a patriotic play to prove his mettle. His student Katu (Chinmay Sant) is eager to sing the National Anthem on Independence Day. For this, he needs to be dressed up in new white clothes. However, his parents Dagadu (Santosh Juvekar) and his wife (Madhura Velankar Satam) can never afford it as they are struggling for even the basic necessities of life (food, clothing and shelter). Will Katu be heartbroken?
