the only album missing is the 2011 Cancer Bats/Black Lungs 7" Split Vinyl(EP), which is extremely rare and hard to find. when I get it, the discography will be updated.

PLEASE, if you like ANY of this music, support the artist & go out to buy the fucking album(s). I'm certain they'll gladly appreciate it, as it costs them money to record, to travel to perform, etc. and have bills to pay like everyone else.
