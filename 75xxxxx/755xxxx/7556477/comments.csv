,BetterRedThan,2012-08-22T12:05Z,This one is uploaded by BOZX. What more do you need to know? 
,2HardRain,2012-08-22T13:54Z,"Yeah I know BOZX, but this is the third 1080p of the Avengers that has been upped, so was just wondering if there is one that is better than the others."
,salesman91,2012-08-22T14:49Z,"I would download this one cuz,its 14 GB of 2d version...."
,jeepers81,2012-08-23T07:52Z,"seed please, the download is 6.5 kbs :S"
,fayatee,2012-08-23T08:11Z,To help you out with choosing which copy. The 16.38gb upload has a black bar that moves in size on the left hand side of the screen. So I'm going to find out if this one has it or not. Otherwise I'll try the 14.48gb one. I'll report back
,Kitts,2012-08-24T00:47Z,@ fayatee - Waiting for your update on the quality bro :)
,jeepers81,2012-08-24T10:03Z,"I hope that does not have the black bar.
