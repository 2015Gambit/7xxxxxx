,MJI,2012-08-23T09:15Z,Can anyone confirm that this is legit?? I NEED THIS! 
,mikeb80,2012-08-23T09:20Z,I will say with absolute certainty that if you look you will see this is very much real. I REALLY hate when people upload fakes.

Well.....I hate them as well, but that doesn't mean you aren't trying to dupe me into downloading some bs....And you didn't even seed for the full file. ZERO SEEDERS. AGAIN on a Bio Mobsters torrent. Can someone please for the sake of all that's holy upload and seed to the max on one of these? "
,MJI,2012-08-24T23:05Z,"How can some of these episodes only be 100MB?? Something strange about this torrent. I want to download it so bad, but something smells...."
,mikeb80,2012-08-25T04:53Z,Some of these epsidodes were converted from low resolution and joined together thats the reason some very small. Its gotta be better then nothing
,mikeb80,2012-08-25T04:55Z,You will see I am seeding now and from now on for sure.
,crumrugin,2012-08-26T00:43Z,"Its perfectly legit folks, from an analogue source but has many files and no one else went thru all the trouble to compile these and edit the ads and seed it so thanks mikeb80"
,mikeb80,2012-08-26T03:01Z,@crumrugin thank you for your honesty and it was not easy jack ruby was for a long time impossible find for me I had this up on deminoid a while ago before it went down and it took me forever to find that one. If I could know where to find the new season other then cable I would put it up.
