  Synopsis     
  
                                                                       
  
  In response to the legend that the "Manson Family" may have filmed 
  themselves in some of theirs exploits, this film is a re-creation as 
  to what a film of their may have been like. The film, shot in a 
  piecemeal fashion, is an intentionally amateurish faux "home movie" of 
  the events leading up to, and including, the infamous Tate-LaBianca 
  murders
