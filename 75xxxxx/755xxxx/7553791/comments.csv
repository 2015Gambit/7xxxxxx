much safer for you and much quicker for everyone else that downloads.

some food for thought. "
[V],psspss,2012-08-21T13:25Z,"seedbox costs more money and more limited then the vpn I use


plus its little savings.. you still have to ftp up and down from the seedbox which uses the same data cap for isp"
[T],trialNerror,2012-08-21T13:26Z,"some more food for thought - chomp chomp

to save even more amounts of traffic, you don't really have to bother doing an xvid if you see a 720p available as the p2p group AFG tends to convert all the 720p stuff to xvid.

and as a heads up from a friend i have that was in a scene group, there is talk going around that maybe scene will be dropping SD releases and doing only 720p within the next year.

if that happens, then AFG will do all the xvid converts so you can really save yourself some bandwidth and perhaps get a big chunk of your internet back to enjoy for yourself."

[V],psspss,2012-08-21T13:39Z,"you prob already noticed I dont do a few shows today however it would be nice if afg came out sooner.. 
problem with afg is they too lazy to add a title to their converts

at the moment im filling in missing stuff as you may of noticed
"
[V],psspss,2012-08-21T13:48Z,some complain the afg xvids are too big then need be as well.. 400-450 rather then 330-360 range.. although some arent always big
