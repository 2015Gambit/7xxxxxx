,Bean-Bandit,2012-08-22T10:26Z,"Game doesn't play well with a controller and sometimes it responds on the mouse to fly and sometimes it doesn't.

This was better in Smartphones and Tablets then what this is."

,xirmer,2012-08-25T01:02Z,"Error language, error language everywhere."
,foo1337,2012-08-25T11:28Z,"The steam crack seems to be bugged a little: every time you reload and dock to a station you get all the achievements again.
And for every achievement there is a money reward.
So reload game => get extra money. Kinda bad for game balance :-)

Thanks for the release though. Gives a chance to play a game before buying it, to see if it is actually good."
,spybro,2012-08-26T23:25Z,Any news on the update (patch 1.0.2 )???
,trismack,2012-08-27T05:51Z,"works fine here, watch my gameplay on youtube, just search ""Galaxy on Fire 2 (HD Version) PC Gameplay trismack""."
