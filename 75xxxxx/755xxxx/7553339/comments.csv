,dellefs0,2012-08-21T08:29Z,First of all you need to encode your files using something like handbrake so your file size isent so large.  Second getting angry at your own mistakes isent helping.  And finally before you try to upload a torrent spend sometime researching how to do it before making a fool out of yourself. 
,gsdhund,2012-08-21T10:32Z,"dellefs0: these are high quality original copies (sans copy protection) for people to enjoy/distribute/cut up for ipods/whatever.

The original set released back in 06-08 was fraught with technical issues. disks that won't play, are riddled with errors, and that ""self format"" themselves.

I believe the canadian version escaped it, but not sure.

Resellers online are charging piles of cash for what is a bug ridden release. I've seen (supposed) still factory sealed ver sions selling for $850. you could buy it, and all the disks won't even play. Nice investment huh?

Even used copies are selling no lower then $190 usually... It's a joke. This set I bought has a crushed box, broken tray underneath with comic books, cards, etc.

It's something you expect to find at a run down old store for no more then $30-$50 (and that's too much with it's issues)

Enjoy it, or skip it. your choice. I would rather have high quality copies floating around then Divx ;-( encoded crap missing special features, etc.

If people make derivatives off of it and release them, that's their choice. much as it is someones choice to download this and enjoy it...."

I am not paying for a seedbox, if you want it faster I require a anonymous cashiers check of exactly $5,000,000,000,000,000. Got it?""

LMAO! Oh, man - that is priceless!"
,gsdhund,2012-09-09T04:17Z,"please seed this folks. I pushed out about 12.2 gigs of this. I will revisit it to seed more, but now i'm seeding one of the season collections. monday or tuesday i'll be somewhere with more bandwith, so expect a ton of it being pushed out"
