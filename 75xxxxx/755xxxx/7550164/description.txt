The first-person shooter Krieger project was started in 2002 and since then many, many hours of a few programmer's spare time went into developing the game. The game itself is just 96kILOBYTES in size and features some rather impressive lighting and texturing techniques, especially considering its tiny footprint. Don't expect any meaty gameplay, but Kreiger is still an impressive technical achievement
