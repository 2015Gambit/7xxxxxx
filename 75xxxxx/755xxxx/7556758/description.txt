The film starts off well with director Om Prakash and actor Sudeep showing glimpses of their talents, but in the second half it is the stunt director who has virtually taken over the film from the director who is unable to decide what to do once the identity of the hero is revealed. 
"Hubballi" has shades of thriller "Borne Identity" and has the hero of the film in search of his own identity throughout the first half of the film. The suspense element coupled with many mysterious things that happen to the hero of the film keeps you to the edge of your seat many a times.
