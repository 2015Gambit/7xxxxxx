,torr.plus,2012-08-22T20:31Z,this works and is probably the best patch i have ever used its nice clean simple fast and saves you hours of time has no annoying music thanks :)
,reconx86,2012-08-27T10:57Z,"Thank you tor,

I dont get some of these crack & patch makers, they just throw a bunch of files together with a manual... while everything can be done with 1-click? :l

That's why I stood up and made a more user-friendly patch... I also released the source code so other can learn how to make more user-friendly patches...

I hope to see better patches in the future..."
,hot.flash,2012-08-27T12:06Z,"I have a few questions. I'm new on here. My first thing I patched was Ps Cs6 about 3 months ago and now I want the whole thing. I'm wondering if ps is going to effect it. do i need to uninstall to install these. Also, where do I download it from? adobe? like i did with Ps? I already dl the torrent and I just set up visual studio. i'm new at this, but i'm a quick study and would appreciate any help. "
,reconx86,2012-08-28T19:58Z,"I dont think the Stand-Alone photoshop install will affect the Master Collection installation. In case it does...

You can just:
- uninstall (both)
- restart
- re-install (master)

I've even applied this patch to a expired Master Collection copy. So this patch is pretty much bulletproof... IF you installed it as a TRIAL...

If you trry to enter a false serial, you MIGHT fuck things up"
,aaa1steve,2012-08-30T00:02Z,I'm again asking the question I raised regarding your other crack date 8/21/12:  Is it safe to let Adobe Updater to supply updates to my Adobe program? Or should I deactivate it?
,reconx86,2012-08-30T15:52Z,"Sorry for my late response, but in general it's not safe to have any update running on any cracked software...

Because there might be a security update added as well"
,aaa1steve,2012-08-30T16:28Z,"I did this installation precisely as you instructed. I now find upon opening Photoshop, that the Trial period notice is counting down the number of days. It went from 28 yesterday to 27 days left today. Shouldn't this stay at 30 days? "
,reconx86,2012-08-30T17:42Z,"The whole trial window shouldnt even appear... so first this Very Important checklist:
- Did you run the patch in Administrator Mode?
(How? Right click Patch.exe - click Administrator Mode)

- Did you close all Adobe applications before running the patch?

- Did you install Adobe Master Collection In trial Mode?

Make sure you can answer all 3 questions with yes"
,jjb5p,2012-09-02T04:32Z,"Hi reconx86...this patch worked great for me for all the adobe programs installed EXCEPT adobe acrobat.  everytime i try to open acrobat, the adobe trial window comes up that states ""validate your serial number"" and it also seems to think i am not connected to the internet even though i am.  Any thoughts on how to get acrobat up and running?  Please advise."
,hovercraft55,2012-09-02T06:51Z,"Hi, I did every thing you said and the same thing happened to me that happened to hot.flash, are you supposed to patch before you install? If so would re installing the trial work?"
,reconx86,2012-09-02T18:54Z,"If there is no internet connection that's good. It will prevent Adobe from deactivating acrobat, try these serials to activate Acrobat X:

1118-1603-2767-5720-9769-6101 1118-1345-4249-3595-0149-5658

1118-1836-4840-5773-1365-9730 1118-1755-1792-2209-0387-0844

1118-1044-1431-6074-3867-5832 1118-1500-4313-1612-5695-9139"
,aaa1steve,2012-09-03T07:13Z,"These serial numbers, and others being generated out there by other key generators, are no longer working. I had one from the X-Force key generator a month+ a go that worked beautifully for more than month (like good for 11,000+ days). Unfortunately, I had to reinstall the Adobe Collection on a new laptop and none of them are working. The key generators may now be working with an outdated Adobe algorithm."
,cosmic#,2012-09-03T22:13Z,"Thank you for your gracious efforts!  Yes, it is simple and quick.  
The Updates are another issue, along with the PremierePro Presets.  There are usually some healthy updates when new so they might be really good.  I know there is a risk of a ""killing"" update but if anyone has any suggestions on how to get updates and the Prempro Presets it would be really appreciated.

Strangely, I WAS able to get a large Acrobat X Pro update.  "
,coolcat9,2012-09-05T09:55Z,After countless Try-out this seems to be so promising... Thanks I hope REVO will uninstall everything so i can start a new.....Thanks Again reconx86
,coolcat9,2012-09-05T13:09Z,"RECONX86 Thank you, it's working except ENCORE which has pop up when starting ""needs a royalty serial no. "" any fix for this?"
,mdiana007,2012-09-06T07:38Z,It says could not find part of path 'x86amtlib.dll
,G-Money615,2012-09-06T18:09Z,Please forgive me all. Yhis is my first time doing this. Do I need to dl & install CS6 master collection first.
,melongeno,2012-09-07T22:05Z,"Hi, there! do you have a cracked amtlib for Acrobat 10.0? I am suspicious that might be the problem we are all having with that important component of the suite."
,reconx86,2012-09-08T11:15Z,"Yes, I recognize the problem now... This crack was written for CS6... So it will only replace amtlib in CS6 folders. Acrobats folder however doesnt end with CS6. But with 10.0 Because acrobat was never a part of master collection until CS6.

 A short test with amtlib.dll on acrobat revealed it only works on the first run and the 2nd run it wont even start. Also it seems you can crack acrobat with adobe_oobelib.dll

So it requires a bit of investigation, but a update for acrobat will come out very soon. (Any tips are welcome)"
,reconx86,2012-09-08T11:23Z,"You can still manually replace the amtlib.dll from my crack folder with the one in the acrobat folder. Just make a backup of the original amtlib.dll. Make sure you get the right one, there is a x86 and a x64 version.

For other users nothing to worry: if youre not a acrobat fan... this is the easiest crack to use."
,BontemSama,2012-09-10T12:52Z,"Hum, in wainting to buy the real thing,lol,Reconx86 you just make my happiness Man,it's work smooth like silk!^^
Thanks!
W'ill seed!^^"
,d1k3r,2012-09-12T07:18Z,"Does this crack works with the LS4 version?
Thanks."

,thebundok,2012-09-14T13:35Z,"The amtlib.dll patch removes functionality from Premiere, Prelude and After Effects. Specifically the ability to import and use footage shot from Canon's line of cameras which package the footage in .mxf containers.

Until .mxf support is restored I can not support this patching method. I have found other methods which work, but which leave the trial dialogue (albeit with over 32,000 days remaining). Please fix this issue because I would love to use this method of patching (so much easier)."
,reconx86,2012-09-15T03:09Z,"@thebunbok thank you for your reply, if you can point out where I can download these DLLs... I can automate the process... and release a update in 24 hours..."
