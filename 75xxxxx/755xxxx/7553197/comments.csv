[V],joshua13,2012-08-21T20:40Z,"given that avi's typically are containers for xvid, a demonstrably inferior and antiquated codec to x.264 in your typical MP4, I think it's a no brainer to use mp4 not to mention iPhone and iPad compatibility. Video professionals will tell you x.264 is better for video and audio. It's not in doubt. MP4 container does not allow for some additional features of x.264 and even smaller file size of an mkv file, but for iOS device users there's no help for it - they have to down convert from mkv if they download those."
