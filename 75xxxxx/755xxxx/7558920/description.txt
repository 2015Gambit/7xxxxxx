Shortly after World War II, the Middle East became a locus for nations seeking to acquire nuclear missiles and the means to deliver them to their enemies. Israel was the first; Libya and Iraq followed suit. Pakistan now almost nearing edge of a failed state possesses a substantial number of nuclear weapons which is posing serious danger to Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, India and Nepal. The implications of the political and security dynamics of the Middle East for the United States and other nations are truly profound and sobering.
 
Beyond Sand and Oil provides a nation-by-nation overview of the evolution of nuclear weapons programs in what is likely the world's most politically unstable region. A detailed assessment of Iran's prospects for becoming a nuclear weapons stateΓÇöand how Israel, the Arab world, and the international community will respond to that outcomeΓÇöis also included.
