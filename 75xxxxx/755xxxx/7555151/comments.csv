,McJizzums,2012-08-22T04:46Z,"@Pancakes1234 You really couldnt have put that any worse... Lol. First of all ""gay"" is not a derogatory word. Secondly, Dont comment on a torrent that you think something is bad... The only people that will read that comment are the people that are coming here to download something they like... And Lastly, I cant believe your wife married someone so deeply in the closet that theyre homophobic and scared about people ""judging"" them. Grow up man. And enjoy life you. You arent gunna get any enjoyment out of negatively commenting things people enjoy.
Peace out."
