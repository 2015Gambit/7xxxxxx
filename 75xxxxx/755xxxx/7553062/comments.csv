Do you know the difference? Cause there isn't a difference.  Check this out:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types

Scroll down under BD/BRRip and read the paragraphs.  I'll even quote the last sentence so you fools who download from YIFY understand why he should not be uploading in the HIGHRES section of TPB.
""BD/BRRips come in various versions: the m-720p (or mini 720p), which is a compressed version of a 720p and usually weighs around 2–3 GB; the 720p, which usually weighs around 4–7 GB and is the most downloaded form of BDRip; the m-1080p (or mini 1080p), which usually weighs a little bit more than 720p; and the 1080p, which can weigh from 8 GB to sizes as big as 40–60 GB. There are also mHD (or mini HD) versions available, which are encoded in lower resolution and are smaller in size."""
,crazyoliv,2012-08-24T16:37Z,"@navy 264.

you are mistaken confusing the glass and its filling. HD means High Definition. This is a qualitative value. Which means that there are as less quality loss from the original data (the theater film) as long as the definition gets higher.
Yifi uses one of the best data compression available (x264 Daubechies wavelet based compression with special secret tunning, Axxo and FGX uses xVid Fourrier based data compression which sucks nowaday). 
Which also means that Yifi gets very high quality for a very high compression ratio (i.e. small data size). As a result, Yifi gets sometime labeled HD (this movie clearly is).

@ Yifi
Sound on this movie sucks. It is either over-loud or over-damped. First time I notice it on a Yifi. What about the sound compression???"
