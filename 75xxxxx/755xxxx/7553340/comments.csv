,dumbson,2012-08-21T08:17Z,are the subs hardcoded?
,link5a,2012-08-21T08:53Z,Thanks BOZX!
,Aoishiro,2012-08-21T09:25Z,"i always get bozx hi-res version, but for this movie, there's so much version. i confused, which one to get. there's another 720p version by bozx NYDIC version, which is a little bit bigger than HDchina one. which one to get?"
[T],xxbel,2012-08-21T09:42Z,hmmm. NYDIC or HDchina ? NYDIC or HDchina ? 
,.Leto.,2012-08-21T09:56Z,"@ Aoishiro: easy, download both versions, play them at the same time so you can precisely compare picture quality. Bigger doesn't always mean better."
[V],BOZX,2012-08-21T10:19Z,different sized/spec version for individual taste.. more to come hold on..
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-21T10:26Z,Been waiting for the release of this movie since forever. Thanks a lot!
,waninoko,2012-08-21T10:36Z,@.Leto.: That's very difficult for some people to do. 7 gigs is no joke man haha
,vaidhy2007,2012-08-22T04:51Z,please leech...
,.Leto.,2012-08-22T05:01Z,"Picture quality is really good, I can't compare with other Avenger rips though. NYDIC 7.3GB rip will only be downloaded tomorrow so I'll post an update later for those interested.
There's a problem with the subtitles. I don't know what kind of fucked up format he used but they don't show up with KMPlayer. With VLC they're not centered, they're on the right of the screen. So you can use these ones instead:
- the full movie, including non-english parts
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4643638/the-avengers-en
- only non-english parts
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4643618/the-avengers-en"
,.Leto.,2012-08-22T07:18Z,"It want faster than I thought, the 7.37GB NYDYC version is already downloaded. I played both at the same time with KMPlayer, my nose right on the screen of my 22"" monitor. Picture quality is identical,colors and definition are the same. If there's a difference I can't see it. So you won't probably be able to see it either when you're watching the movie on your sofa a few meters aways from the screen. BTW the NYDYC release doesn't have any subtitles at all.
You're welcome."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-22T09:16Z,"@.Leto.: PGS subtitles. These are graphic, not text based subtitles and this is the format they appear on blu-ray's. They're better imo than srt's. And on Media Player Classic, there's no issue of subs appearing not in the center. Everything's goood. :)"
