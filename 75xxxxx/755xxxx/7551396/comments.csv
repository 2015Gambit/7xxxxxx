I normally jump (no pun intended) when I see froggie100 uploads. The size of the .torrents are relatively small without losing any quality.

I did not get a chance to check the quality of this .torrent because this video file starts with a preface. It shows what looks like an overhead shot of a wooden bench with a skull, crossbones, and some coins on it. The words ""Pirate 26k-HD,"" ""In Quality We Trust"" are to the left of the skull.

If you do not care about such things, I suspect the rest of the video file may be fine. However, I do not need someone's forced hand to give credit where credit is due. I am sure there are other downloads without such a preface."
