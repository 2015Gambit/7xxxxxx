Restoring Love - Were YOU there?

Every movement has a soundtrack, and we are proud to start introducing you to the artists that will make the music for ours. There are artists out there with messages that need to be heard but have had doors slammed in their face. No more. We want to find those people who believe in America and make sure their message is seen and heard.
