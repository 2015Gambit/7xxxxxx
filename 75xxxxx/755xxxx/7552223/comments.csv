,Revisionist,2012-08-21T17:53Z,"Its very good quality.  There is only a small glitch near the end. The movie was not shot in a ""widescreen"" format so thats why it looks 16:9.  There was no cropping.  

Im really picky about my movie files and this one was fine.  

A lot of times it seems like the encoders dont have the RAM to process big files right so they end up choppy or with major synch issues.  The 7 gig file played smooth aside from the one glitch.

Dont complain about how any of us need to serve you or your problems it is a voluntary service uploading these applications and you have no right to any type of support for these products! With that said soon there (hopefully) be a process put into effect which will ban all access to any files from various sites to those users who continue to harass, offend, or in any way disrespect the kind and generous users who work so hard and long to offer these costly and expensive titles to the less fortunate or less accessible of us! You can either accept that maybe 1 out of every 20 DL's may have a glitch which keeps them from running on some or all of the CPU systems out there or you can live without the other 20 that do work!

,johnpaulmathew,2012-08-24T15:49Z,"Hey guys, those who have problems with download speeds here is a super kool tip. First go to zbigz.com and create a free profile. Then copy the magnet link url and paste it on the given bar. Click go and wait for few seconds. After it finishes caching ur torrents you will get a blue zip file icon. Click on it and your download will start. For best results use IDM and u will get the maximum possible speeds of ur Broadband connection. Try it guys, it really works. The only limitation is you can only cach two torrents at the same time. But not a big issue bcoz once u get the zip file for download u can delete the cached file from zbigz and add new ones. Thank me later. :)
The whole thing may sound like complicated to u guys but trust me once you download a torrent using this method u will never go back to traditional torrent clients. Once again try it guys.
NB: Plz use IDM for maximum speeds. "
