========================================================


The Supercrooks are raiding The Bastard's mansion, but everything goes horribly wrong. The Bastard - the world's greatest super-villain and 4th richest man on the planet - discovers that the Supercrooks are out to steal every cent he's ever made. Group leaders Johnny and Kasey fight and split up. The heist is complex, but the reward is enormous-and if the Supercrooks can survive, it will mean the end of The Heat's debts back in Vegas... not to mention an enormous payday.
