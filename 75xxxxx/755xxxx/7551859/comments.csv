É normal que o seu antivirus detecta algum viru'sito no ficheiro, porque o que ele faz é remover tudo o que a microsoft possa usar para detectar que é uma falsificação, não tem que se preocuper com isso, se preferir pode correr um seu antivirus com scan total, e ele apaga tudo o que for virus, o seu office continuará activo."

,NATIBOY2013,2012-08-25T02:19Z,"@patizinhaBR. Your antivirus deleted the file because it is illeagal to use the activator. Its the same as with keygens. your antivirus detects it as a trojan because it is illegal...here's how you do this...first, disable your antivirus and firewall when you download this torrent. Second, save the activator to a flashdrive. Third, i use bitdefender total security2013 and i have the option set to not scan flashdrives. this doesnt matter,however, if you turn it off completely. go to microsoft.com and download the trial. dont let it update during install if prompted. after trial is downloaded reboot your computer in ""safe mode with networking""..i have windows 7 so, to do this, when you reboot repeatedly press f8 several time untill your boot options menu comes up...then scroll to ""safe mode with networking"". when computer boots up it will look very different, dont be alarmed however as this option just uses as little information as possible to boot your computer. now from here you can run the activator and follow the onscreen prompts to register your product....enjoy....."

,Rollie73,2012-08-27T17:09Z,Worked perfect.  I saved it to my flash drive then scanned it with two different antivirus programs and it was clean both times.     THANKS!!
,Kortzen,2012-08-27T21:19Z,"I dont know about the contents, but the ""activator"" doesn't work at all.
It just goes 100% CPU and doesn't do anything.
On top of that I cant delete the folder it was created in, eventhough I turned off my anti-virus!

Avoid this torrent!"
