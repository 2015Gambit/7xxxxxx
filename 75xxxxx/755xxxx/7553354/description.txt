So I recently did some GBA ROMS that would work for android, now it's only
fair that i upload a nice, working GBA Emulator for android.

It's called gameboid and included in the torrent is the BIOS file, without it the
emulator wouldn't work.

To install, you just copy the .apk file to you phone/tablet and using a file manager
you open and simply install.

After you do that, you should place the gba_bios.bin file in the same folder where 
you have your GBA ROMS, provided you downloaded any.

Next when you open gameboid, which is already installed, that would ask you to locate the BIOS file. So you go into the ROM folder you created and select the gba_bios.bin file.

After you do that it would take you back to your ROM folder where you can now select any GBA ROM and play.


Note...if you closed gameboid and tried to play another game and you get an error about loading BIOS file, then on gameboid press the menu button on your phone and go to settings, click the first thing you see which is GBA BIOS file and locate the file again. It should work after that.


Don't worry you might not get that problem ^^^. But if you do that's a quick fix. 


You could check my torrents for some GBA ROMs or check the internet...
