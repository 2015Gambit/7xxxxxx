Considering my 'friggin' u/l speed' ... What say, shd I stop these 20 odd AND seed only GAME?

Tell me & consider it done!!

Do let me know which shd I stop seeding so that others are 'prioritized' "
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-20T13:06Z,"I already seed movies and season packs from list above both on SU and TPB - except individual TV shows episodes.
I suggest you to seed Solaris only, and stop seeding everything else. When you see how I have finished Solaris (OVH in ""Peers"") you can stop seeding that too. I would seed.

And there is no need to ""force start"" if you adjust settings as I have suggested (and screenshots too) on SU hundredths times.
I lately get more and more e-mails when people Force without any reason at all.
