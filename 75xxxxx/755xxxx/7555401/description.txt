Mr. or Ms. 'joesee' asked for edits of the Ella Set 225. So here are some edits. I have not edit all pictures, only "The best of...", because there are no automatic settings for this. Sometimes i wish i can use this in the town. =) 
I have to do it with each picture separately. Maybe its not necessary to do this in the future, and she do that what we waiting for.

Enjoy!

If you miss your favorite picture, leave a comment and i will do it and upload it to bayimg or another imghost.
