,ourfrank,2012-08-21T13:03Z,You can see all of the contents here: http://pastebay.net/1071748
,ourfrank,2012-08-21T13:05Z,"Wait, no, you can't. Sorry. PasteBay cropped the file so only the authors with last names beginning with A are viewable. Well, scrap this, just download the contents.txt.zip."
,ourfrank,2012-08-21T13:06Z,"Wait, no, you can't. PasteBay cropped the file so only the first 5% is visible. Sorry about that."
,ourfrank,2012-08-21T13:10Z,"PirateBay is strange. Only my first comment is visible, which is bad. And now it looks like I'm talking to myself. Well, what can you do. Tee hee."
,nas.ebooks,2012-08-21T20:09Z,"If you click ""files"" above, the contents of your torrent will be listed. :)"
,ourfrank,2012-08-21T21:09Z,"@nas.ebooks: Thanks, but the files link lists only the authors' zip files, not the contents of those zipped files. The actual list of all the files within the torrent (unzipped) is too large to fit on PasteBay. You can find this list in contents.txt.zip within the torrent."
,kabalizo,2012-08-22T07:21Z,Thank u :)
,bibliophile1979,2012-08-23T20:13Z,"Thanks ourfrank this is a great upload. You Wouldn't happen to have the last 3 Dante Valentine's would you?

Lilith Saintcrow - Dante Valentine Series

3- The Devil's Right Hand
4- Saint City Sinners
5- To Hell and Back

I've been searching for this series for month's but nobody i know has them. If you or anyone else runs across them and uploads them i'd appreciate it."
,ourfrank,2012-08-26T16:55Z,"@bibliophile1979: Sorry, I don't have them. The uploaded library is three to four years old, so it doesn't contain any books published in the meantime.

You can find the books you're searching for on irc.undernet.org's #bookz channel. If you're not sure how to use IRC, look here: https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Bookz

I've checked and these are the files you can get on #bookz, regarding Lilith Saintcrow: http://pastebin.com/vNR0NqvT

Good luck."
