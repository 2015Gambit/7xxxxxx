* Contains various works of over a thousand science fiction and fantasy
  authors. Almost all of the files have been taken from undernet#bookz.
  Many thanks to everyone who made these digital copies available, and
  most of all thanks to the authors themselves.

* Due to PirateBay's limitations, each of the authors is his or her
  own zipped file. This means there are zipped files within zipped
  files. Yes, I've created a monster! I'm sorry.

* Check out contents.txt to easily see whether the torrent contains
  the files that you desire.

* A rule of thumb: the more popular the author, the more of his works
  have been included. The more popular a work, the more chances of its
  inclusion. Most everything from the old science fiction giants is
  therefore included, for instance.
  
* Many works can be found in multiple formats, mostly txt, pdf and lit,
  but including also html, rtf and others.

* This is a large library that has been generated semi-automatically
  and has not been entirely checked by hand, so rough parts like
  duplicate and inconsistently named files are to be expected.
