""Centers on the Klein family, who live in a remote house in the mountains. Considered the black sheep, youngest son Jean is thrown out. Angry and threatening, he arrives at Nils and Ida's chalet for a hunting expedition. The next day, he learns how to kill. The following night, his mother's car is set on fire and he is blamed. He disappears into the mountains with a gun. On the third day, it pours down with rain and, in the evening, a storm brews. Shut up in their house, the Klein family await with dread the return of Jean, who will challenge them, weapon in hand."" from IMDb
