This time Max and Stacy discuss further signs of success from the shakedown of Standard Chartered as the City starts firing, while the Street is hiring. Max and Stacy look at some of the help wanted ads and examine the unusually small head of JP Morgan's chief executive. 

In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Ned Naylor-Leyland of Cheviot Asset Management about unallocated versus allocated gold and silver bullion and permanent backwardation as a sign that everything is breaking down completely in the precious metals market.
