Building The Empire State
The Empire State Building is perhaps the most recognisable building in the world. Now, on its 80th anniversary, a new building is rising above Manhattan to join the Empire State Building in defining the New York skyline: Tower One of the World Trade Center, see the fascinating story behind these two steel giants and learn how skyscraper construction has changed in 80 years. Set to be the tallest building in America, this hugely symbolic structure - rising from the footprints of the Twin Towers - represents the hopes and spirits of its nation, just as the Empire State Building did before it. This one-off special is an emotional story behind its design, along with the incredible family connections linking its construction team to the pioneering iron-workers of the past.
