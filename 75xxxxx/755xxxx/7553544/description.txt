Transcribed from the sleeve's back:

"Big, strong and imponent animals. Sweet, kind and
emotional beings.

They're calm, peaceful, harmless. However, if something
threatens them or their family they react and fight like
brave warriors. Mothers protect their children at all
costs. The elders back up each other. With unbreakable
family ties they stand their ground. They represent
strength, sincerity, commitment and a balanced community.

Elephants face fear and danger TOGETHER."



DIY album from this Portuguese act. Came with lyric sheet
and a bumper sticker.
