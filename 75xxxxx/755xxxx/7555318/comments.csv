It was withdrawn because in “exposing the myths you’ve always believed” about Jefferson, Tea Party affiliate Barton appears to have falsified rebuttals of the Constitutional forefather's reputation for secularism, progressive tendencies and (specifically) anti-slavery undertakings, according to MSNBC Today Books."
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T02:00Z,"Sorry, but MSNBC's attack on Barton have already been proven FALSE - across many lines of the accusations put out there.  You see...

Barton - actually cites ORIGINAL documents written by people who were actually THERE, along with Jefferson himself.  Rather, MSNBC relies on History professors who cite books written ABOUT Jefferson in the late 1800s and early 1900s...  Which in turn, do not cite any direct evendence as to the accuracy of the information being presented.

Basically - Barton has ""Straight from the mouth of the individuals in question"" - while MSNBC uses liberal revisionists who have an agenda to push.

You should have immediately known your source for why it was pulled was bullshit by the ""MSNBC"" portion alone...  proven to be the most left leaning, and most misleading news organization out there.  They are PROUD to call themselves Socialist - and their On Air Personalities even proclaim they are openly on their shows.

But then again, you are drinking their Kool Aid aren't you?

Why don't you READ THE BOOK - and STUDY the Footnotes and make your own opinion as to what the truth is before you let MSNBC decide for you what to believe.  

(Another Reason Why you need to READ the books in the ""Patriots Bookshelf"" just search for it or check my upload history - Must Reads if you want to know what history REALLY is)"
,smartass33914,2012-08-22T02:20Z,"i think MSNBC should have been your first clue why your comment was so moronic.  great book and i have a hard copy but amazon pulled it off my kindle.  thank you for sharing, i paid for it, i should be able to continue to read it"
,Vikingman1111,2012-08-22T03:14Z,"Any sensible, thinking person who buys into Barton's crap on Jefferson also thinks David Irvine is the greatest historian ever. Be warned. Martians are not far away."
,Sheepfancier,2012-08-22T10:24Z,vikingman - was that the clumsiest attempt to invoke Godwins law or what?
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T20:15Z,"@Viking - Hmmm... so where do you feel that Barton gets his stuff wrong?  Oh yeah...  You can't trust anyone who actually goes to source material instead of asking Liberal professors who make it clear that nothing that they speak on is backed up with facts.  Get a life - read the ORIGINAL material and learn something instead of relying on morons who call themselves teachers.

You are probably among the masses who still believe Washington cut down a Cherry Tree and had Wooden Teeth...  Moron..."
