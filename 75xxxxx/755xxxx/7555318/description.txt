Yes, this is the book that Harper Collins decided was too controversial to be printed and they BANNED it from being sold!  

The Jefferson Lies - By David Barton

In August of 2012, Harper Collins bought Christian Publisher "Thomas Nelson" and immediately started pulling the plug on books it deemed "controversial".  

The first to be hit with this "Book Burning" from the Left - was The Jefferson Lies by David Barton.

No longer can you buy this book.  This book has been BANNED by the Liberal Left who wants to rewrite history.

Read the book for yourself, study the thousands of footnotes and bibliography, and read the TRUTH in Thomas Jefferson's Own Words!

This is the book that became a National Best Seller and was quickly banned by the Left because FACTS get in the way of the left's agenda.

THE TRUTH HAS NO AGENDA

Read this book, and if you like it - send a donation to WallBuilders.Com - and support David Barton as he makes sure that the FACTS are what the Truth is built upon!
