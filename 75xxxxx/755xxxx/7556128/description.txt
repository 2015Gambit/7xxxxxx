NO VIDEO WAS RE-ENCODED OR TRANSCODED HERE.
Pour x264 video from MP4 LossLessLy into AVI container.
Convert audio from AAC to MP3 for legacy hardware.

People should have a choice of quality AVI encodes.
Many are creating excellent re-encodes from 720p MKV sources.
Especially nice if you need or want XVID.

To find mine, use search term "x264.MP3*.avi"
