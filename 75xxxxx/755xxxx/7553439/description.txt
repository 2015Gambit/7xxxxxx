Weight of the Nation Season 1

Three years in the making, The Weight of the Nation brings together the country's leading research institutions in a national initiative to help shed light on solutions to restore our individual and collective health. The centrepiece of The Weight of the Nation is the 4-part documentary series that features case studies and interviews with experts as well as individuals and families struggling with obesity. Each part focuses on a particular issue: "Consequences," examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese; "Choices," reveals the science behind obesity and weight loss; "Children in Crisis," documents the impact the epidemic is having on the nation's children; and "Challenges," examines the major forces behind the obesity epidemic.
Parts 5 to 16 are a collection of 12 films ranging in length from 11 to 30minutes each part focuses on a particular issue.




11)  Stigma 
The prejudice faced by obese people takes an enormous toll. Some people tease others about their weight, perhaps thinking the teasing would help motivate them to lose weight. But evidence points to the contrary: the pain and isolation many overweight and obese people feel can actually contribute to future weight gain, rather than setting them on a path toward better health.

12)  Overweight in the Workplace 
As a nation, obesity is driving our health care costs up and dragging our economy down. Experts estimate that obesity in our workforce costs businesses more than $73 billion each year in lost productivity. This film looks at the efforts of one small corporation-the Nabholz Construction Company in Conway, Arkansas-to improve the health of its workforce and save money.
