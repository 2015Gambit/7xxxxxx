Since the source is The.Expendables.2.2012.TS.READNFO.XVID-26K, which I just DLd that file I'll just save you the effort of DLn this 4.35gigs of BULLSHIT. Same cropped out, heads cut off bullshit, except now you got half the screen cut off and the other half filled with some subs which i can't read. So, save your time, bandwidth and frustration for something a lil more realistic.....like curing world hunger or something."
,Neraforesta,2012-08-22T22:10Z,"p.s. TWO FULL PAGES worth of the same file, same copy, same bullshit if you care to be gentle on these asshats. PLEASE TPB, clean it up and just delete ALL of these why don't ya. They aren't worth watching, and basically being spammed on your network."

,Neraforesta,2012-08-23T00:19Z,Of course you say that. You're making money from others clicks. Turn in your skull if you don't like what the masses opinion is.
,Pigeon06,2012-08-24T12:29Z,you really can't trust any highly anticipated movie that just came out in the theaters to actually be a DVDrip..it's basically a red flag..
