 Your copy of CleanMyMac appears to be illegal and will be deactivated.
MacPaw is a small company, and we rely on CleanMyMac sales to keep developing it. Please support our company and CleanMyMac's improvements by getting your legal license."
,salmanlse,2012-08-24T19:47Z,works perfect so far :)
,sndman148,2012-08-31T01:52Z,"This torrent does work, in that it does download, install and activate properly (with the keygen). 

HOWEVER! This will give you the error message
""Unfortunately you are using a pirated version. Please support us and buy a legal copy of CleanMyMac. Exclusively for you we offer a 50% discount right now.""

THIS TORRENT/CRACK DOES NOT WORK!!!"
,blanquefort,2012-09-01T22:39Z,Fully functional ... it is necessary to use Little snitch.
,chadr99,2012-09-08T06:21Z,"CleanMyMac 'calls home' when it is open, it checks the SN to see if it is one that is actually purchased.  If you don't block this call, it will de-activate itself.

To get around this, you will need to block the activation servers.

Add this to your hosts file:

127.0.0.1      www.macpaw.com
127.0.0.1      sn.macpaw.com
127.0.0.1      users.macpaw.com

Save it. Enjoy and avoid updating the software."
,wcoakley,2012-09-12T16:08Z,Can you tell me how to add these to the host file please?
,paravians,2012-09-13T16:03Z,"Tried both Little Snitch and blocking via hosts file with no luck, it still says it's a pirated copy!!"
