Can't find The Gilded Rune book either, sucks that Demonoid got crushed, they always had the new forgotten realms novels up as soon as they were released. Hopping it will eventually pop up on TPB. Theres three new forgotten realms novels coming out in September alone."
,masonicbro,2012-08-21T11:16Z,So far Key of Stars (Book 3 of Abolethic Sovereignty) is DRM protected cant open it.
,masonicbro,2012-08-21T11:49Z,"Cold Steel and Secrets last 3 books are DRM locked, as well."
,HootieB,2012-08-22T18:52Z,"Does anybody have the 3rd book in The Abyssal Plague trilogy ""Eye Of The Chained God"" by Don Bassingthwaite (ebook released in April 2012)???

I have been to trying to buy it actually, but are prohibited from doing so since I live in Scandinavia and Wizards of the Coast Publication only allows sales of ebooks to US or UK citizens.

While technically not a Forgotten Realms series (to begin with), it's a ""D&D"" release, alot of the story concerns Faerun. The Abyssal Plague is the MOST important D&D event WOTC has created in years. You can read about it's development here http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/drdd/20110316

Moia420 you are thus actually missing 2 stand-alone FR novels dealing with The Abyssal Plague ""Shadowbane"" by Erik Scott de Bie + ""Sword of the Gods"" [Sword of the Gods 01]  by Bruce Cordell.

I dont mind uploading the WOTC novels I have that others are missing, but I'am on a Mobile Broadband connection at the moment, so seeding is nearly impossible for me because of the VERY low upload limit that comes with my subscription.

BTW, the ""You cannot buy an ebook in english outside the US"" policy, has also hurt other of my ebook collections. In the Eberron world, i'm missing 2 excellent novels by award winner Paul Crilley: ""Nights of the Long Shadow"" + ""Taint Of The Black Brigade"". Any D&D fan out there have these 2???

I do have all the A.P. Books currently released and was planning on posting them in a separate torrent.  I was debating on whether or not to add the couple you mentioned into this pack, like I did with 'Sword of the Gods - Spinner of Lies'.  But since A.P. blends into multiple settings, 'Dark Sun' etc.. I decided to follow the F.R. guide of what was part of its collection.  You should see my post with A.P. soon thou :)"
