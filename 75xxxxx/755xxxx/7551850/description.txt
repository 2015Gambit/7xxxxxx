An Object-Oriented Approach to Programming Logic and Design, Third Edition provides the beginning programmer with a guide to developing object-oriented program logic. This textbook assumes no programming language experience. The writing is nontechnical and emphasizes good programming practices. The examples are business examples; they do not assume mathematical background beyond high school business math. Additionally, the examples illustrate one or two major points; they do not contain so many features that students become lost following irrelevant and extraneous details.

As with most college text books, this retails usually for about $120, which is criminal imho.  Enjoy sticking it to the man!
