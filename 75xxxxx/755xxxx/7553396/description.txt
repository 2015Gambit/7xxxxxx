You caught me off guard, you know
 Hey I'm wasting my judge
 Don't know if you can hold me but, 
 I gotta honor it yeah
 Depending on the minute and depending on the hours
 I guess I got some time to waste so
 We can chop away the hours, yeah

 Cool so let's sing, and then let's walk
 And then let's talk, and, and then, and then
 Let's sing, and then less walking, and less talking
 And we'll sing, yeah
 Bring your car in the parking lot
 And ride all night till you get a spot
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 No we ain't doing nothing
 Meet us in the parking lot
 We're turn the speakers up
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 We ain't doing nothing

 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh
 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh

 I'm telling all my friends that it's pretty casual
 They tryin'... what they see
 Meanwhile I'm riding with you, with you
 Depending on the minute and depending on the hours
 Depending on the chemicals yeah we can make some power

 Cool so let's sing, and then let's walk
 And then let's talk, and, and then, and then
 Let's sing, and then less walking, and less talking
 And we'll sing, yeah
 Bring your car in the parking lot
 And ride all night till you get a spot
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 No we ain't doing nothing
 Meet us in the parking lot
 We're turn the speakers up
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 We ain't doing nothing

 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh
 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh

 Hand in hand and arm in arm
 Take me to your favorite barn
 We can dance in the mud
 It's slippery, show me all you buckery
 Let's dance in the rain, keep dancing
 Nothing unusual about it
 You're just a regular guy, and there's no way around it
 If you walk with me then we can talk about it
 And if you want me talking let's see what we do about it

 Bring your car in the parking lot
 And ride all night till you get a spot
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 No we ain't doing nothing
 Meet us in the parking lot
 We're turn the speakers up
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 We ain't doing nothing

 Bring your car in the parking lot
 And ride all night till you get a spot
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 No we ain't doing nothing
 Meet us in the parking lot
 We're turn the sβ╣ùeakers up
 Cause we ain't doing nothing
 We ain't doing nothing

 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh
 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh

 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh
 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh

 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh
 Na-na-na-na-na
 Le-le, ha-a-a-a-ha
 Eh-eh-eh

 We could dance, if you wanna dance, if you wanna dance
 Ain't nothing I can't show ya

 We could dance, if you wanna dance, if you wanna dance
 Ain't nothing I can't show ya

 We could dance, if you wanna dance, if you wanna dance
 Ain't nothing I can't show ya

 We could dance, if you wanna dance, if you wanna dance
 Ain't nothing I can't show ya

Thanks
