Carmen Maura is the daughter of a prominent politician as well as a regular in the AlmodovarHere she shows proof of her abundant talent in this French (or Belgian?) movie.

The world's children have decided that the world is such a horrible place (pollution, etc.) that they refuse to be born. Somehow they are in communication with each other, and with a few sensitive grownups. This has a bit of sci-fi, a bit of horror, a bit of melodrama, and a good deal of social commentary. It's a pity it's been so overlooked, anything with Carmen Maura is worth checking out.
