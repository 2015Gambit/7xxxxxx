Our Grand Re-Opening will take place during the Lake City, SC Tobacco Festival, which will take place from September 13th through 15th. We'll be having our traditional karate classes that same week, as well as our new Fitness and Aikido classes. We are located at 118 Sauls Street in Lake City - a short walk from the town square, where most of the Festival's activities will take place! If you will be in town for the Festival, please come visit us for at least a few minutes :) :)
