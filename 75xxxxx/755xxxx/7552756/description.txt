Pour x264 video from MP4 LossLessLy into AVI container.
Convert audio from AAC to MP3 for legacy hardware.

People should have a choice of quality AVI encodes.
Many are creating excellent re-encodes from 720p MKV sources.
Especially nice if you need or want XVID.

But x264 does just fine in an AVI container, so here we are.
To find mine, use search term "x264.MP3*.avi"
