I'd definitely give everyone a description of all of the books in this group but there are just wayyyy to many for me to even begin to describe. The books vary greatly but are all good in their own separate ways. 

Most of these books have been personally edited with genres and metadata through Calibre and manual hand-work so whenever you drag them into iTunes, they should pop right up. 

Enjoy and leave a comment below. :) This is my first torrent and I'd love to know how everyone enjoys it and how I can do better. Please no negativity.

Just for future reference, I'll be uploading mostly books but occasionally you'll get songs, movies, etc.

I take requests so let me know how I can help!
