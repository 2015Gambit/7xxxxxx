Full featured and fast HDR camera for Android:
Real life scenes often have a wide range of light intensity, which cannot be captured by a camera. In a photo of such a scene the bright areas look washed out and everything in shadows is pictured as a black spot with no details. The HDR technique allows you to capture details in bright and dark areas and have them merged in a single photo.

    Full resolution
    Real HDR: exposure bracketing and tone mapping
    Simple: take a HDR image in one tap
    HDR images fused and tone mapped on device within seconds
    Hand shake compensation, no need to be rock-solid while shooting
    Correct handling of moving objects, de-ghosting
    You can control tone-mapping parameters: contrast, micro-contrast, color vividness, exposure
    Save original exposure bracketed images
