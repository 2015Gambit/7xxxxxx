A perfect soundboard recording from the Eagles 1994 Hell
Freezes Over tour. I believe this to be a soundobard instead
of an FM broadcast because as far as I know they never did 
any FM broadcasts from this tour other than the MTV special.
One of the more popular recordings from their 1994 tour, I 
haven't seen this on DIME yet so I thought I'd share it.
Couple of things to note: first, on disc 1 the last track has
both "Lyin' Eyes" and "One Of These Nights" on it. No idea why 
these were not plit up, but this is how I got it. These are
original silver CD's BTW, NOT CD-R's. Second, you may be able to
fit these onto 2 discs - again this is how I got it, on 3 discs
and so I've never changed it. Third, there is artwork out there.
I can't upload it but this is a very popular CD so I'm sure a 
little searching on the internet and you can find something.
This was the set list through-out most of the 1994 and 1995 tour.
Not too bad - my only complaint was that they played too many of
their solo hits during the second act. I mean, we were there to see
the Eagles! They had so many songs - "James Dean", "The Last Resort",
"Ol' 55", "Saturday Night", the list goes on and on. Otherwise, this is
a fantastic recording, it basically speaks for itself, so please rate 
and ENJOY!!!
