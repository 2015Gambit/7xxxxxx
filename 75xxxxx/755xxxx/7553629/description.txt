Issues 1-4 of Charles Vess' 'The Book of Ballads & Sagas', published independently by the artist on Green Man Press. 


Started in 1995, published biannually (attempted to, anyway) with ad advertised run of six issues, they only made it to issue four and took nearly three full years to get there. Still a great series, one that will likely live far beyond the "fame" and life of it's creator in it's various collected forms.

Here I am providing the original, b&w, first print, self-published issues, cover to cover.

Guest writers on the series include Neil Gaiman, Sharyn McCrumb, Jeff Smith, Midori Snyder, Elaine Lee, Delia Sherman, Ellen Kushner, Elizabeth Willey, Emma Bull, Terri Winding, Jane Yolen, Charles DeLint and Rob Walton.

As a additional bonus I am including a high resolution scan (in CBR form) of my personal copy of 'The Book of Ballads & Sagas' color portfolio (number 463/1500, the front cover says).
