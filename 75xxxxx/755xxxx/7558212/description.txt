 The Nexus: International Terrorism and Drug Trafficking from Afghanistan addresses an issue that directly impacts the prospects for resolution of the current insurgency in that nation. Written by noted terrorism expert Frank Shanty, the book explores the nature and the extent of involvement between international criminal drug traffickers, particularly of drugs originating from Afghanistan, and international terrorist networks with global reach.
 
Shanty dispels the myths and disinformation surrounding this vitalΓÇöand controversialΓÇöquestion, even as he arrives at his own answers. In addition to offering a historical overview of the opium problem in Afghanistan from the late 1970s to 2010, the book looks at three distinct phenomena. It examines the existence, characteristics, and behavior of international terrorists operating from Afghanistan, specifically the evolution and ascendancy of al-Qaeda and the Taliban and the nature of their relationship. It looks at Afghanistan's opium trade relative to specific-actor involvement and, finally, it analyzes allegations of a link between terrorists in Afghanistan and international drug criminals and the implications of that connection.
