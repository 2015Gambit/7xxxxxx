What Windows you have ??"
,insublime,2012-08-21T17:53Z,"How you install, launch part one and leave parts 2 & 3 alone, that means don't even touch them, don't extract them, nothing. downloaded over night for me, faster than the skidrow one. I'll seed for a little to help this torrent get on it's feet, thanks a lot. Also, don't hit close on the install. You'll see a few times it'll look like the bar has completed, just give it a sec and it'll go back to the finish (bad UI on the installer if you ask me)."
,Kneph,2012-08-22T00:44Z,"Woooow...do you people nont know how to read or something??? Is says ""open part 1....COMA...part 2 and part 3 install automatically""

Anyway..this isnt working for me. It installed without problems, bur when I start the game, a screen comes up for a second then disappears. I have win7, updated drivers, etc... Anybody know why this is?"
,1man_army,2012-08-22T01:22Z,"This worked without a problem for me. Thanks a lot! For those that are having problems, READ the instructions! Install part 1 and then part 2 and part 3 should install automatically. Afterwards it should take you to nosteam.ro page and download the update patch that it tells you to download. Once that is downloaded move it to the sleeping dogs nosteam folder and install it from there. Then start it up from the shortcut that's in desktop and enjoy."
,Kneph,2012-08-22T02:52Z,This just isnt working at all. Ive udated everything...I dloaded the update patch exe from the nosteam site..installed it..and I have the same prob...window opens up for a second then instantly closes. I even tried run as administrator..still no luck
,ashween123,2012-08-22T02:56Z,come on ppl seed please im only gettin 0.1 kb lame please i waited for this game for ever  !
,Kneph,2012-08-22T03:41Z,ashween123 The  problem is on your side...not the seeders. As you can see...theres over 100 seeds for this. Stop your torrent and start it again. Hope this game works for you cause this doesnt work for me at all
