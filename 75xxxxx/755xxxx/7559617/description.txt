Surprised that this one wasn't already here...


Neil Gaiman's 'Only The End of the World Again'

From the Wiki page.............

The story concerns the character of Lawrence Talbot, a claims adjustor and werewolf who finds himself in Innsmouth on a cold winter's night with the townspeople trying to bring about the return of the Elder Gods. It was written as a tribute to Roger Zelazny, and inspired by his novel A Night in the Lonesome October.

Written by Neil Gaiman
Adapted by Troy Nixey
Art by P. Craig Russell
Coloring by Matthew Hollingsworth

The first presentation is the original b&w Oni Double Features from 1998, issues 6-8, scanned and compiled as one book in the cbr format. This is my preferred version as I think the colored release takes away some of the details in P. Craig Russels' art.

The second presentation, which is included at the end of the b&w ODF cbr file, is an original, unadapted text version with b&w statue "illustrations" that Neil allowed to be printed to benefit the CBLDF. I have one of those so I scanned it and attached it at the end of the comic.

The third presentation is the reprinted, colored version from the year 2000, also by Oni Press.
