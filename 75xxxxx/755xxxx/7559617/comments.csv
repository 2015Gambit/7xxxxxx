That's the only information I can find about the dang thing online. It will be there for the next few weeks, but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you are the hardest of hardcore Neil Gaiman completeists (which I am, I mean, I bought a damn poetry magazine because it had a one-page - maybe two, I forget - Neil Gaiman poem in it)."

Artwork by Troy Nixey

As such, I think the colored version takes away from the detail of Troy Nixey's artwork.

Apologies. Totally my fault."
