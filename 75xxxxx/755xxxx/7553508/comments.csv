There's no audio...

I'm new to the Android world and this is probably the first app I've installed away from the app store after rooting, so maybe I'm just missing something...

Any ideas? Nexus 7 over here..."

Have you check the options for sound enable mate?"

I toggled them a couple times to see if it would ""catch,"" but no difference. Plugged in headphones, no sound there.

I downloaded this w/ a torrent client on the phone, then just used ES File Explorer to go to the folder and start it from there. It says it installs.

Is that the proper way?"
