Editor's Choice - Google Play 2012HD Widgets are the next generation of widgets - something fun and amazing designed for today's high resolution, multi-gesture screens. Make iPad/iPhone users go nuts with envy!

HD Widgets includes a dozen beautiful widgets that show current time, current weather, weather forecast, and utility switches. We put a TON of time into designing each widget to look great on every Android screen, from 320x480 phones all the way up to 1280x800 tablets.

The best part of HD Widgets is how fun and easy it is to use. Everything in the app is swipeable: the menu, the pages, and the options. You just swipe left and right to change details on the fly. You can mix and match various clocks (LED, flip clock, and Honeycomb) with backgrounds, layouts, and other options. Simple!
