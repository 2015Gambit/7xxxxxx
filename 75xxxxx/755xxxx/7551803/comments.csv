The video quality is very good but, there is no dialogue from the right side. Music plays from all but the rear right channel but dialogue plays from only the left side (rear more pronounced than the front) and the center channels. I compared this to other movies and I confirmed that it is just this file.  I have a six-channel audio setup and audio from other movies play from all six channels."
