,makpirat,2012-08-24T00:38Z,the movie was able to download in HD in russian lang. before a month.
,ZIPPy1TOE,2012-08-24T03:38Z,"He was Turkish in Snatch dip shit, but thanks for your comment. Subs? anyone anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"

That was actually his character in Snatch. A far better effort than Safe which is a steaming crap pile. Hopefully making movies like this will put an end to his career soon.

V=6
A=5

There are better HD rips of this one out now with the same filesize and far higher quality picture.

,piranical,2012-08-24T13:30Z,excellent quality DVDRip v10 a10. to rate this rip 6/5 (by any standard) is just plain stupid/agenda based or both. 
,raving_dead,2012-08-24T15:18Z,"Thank you drmmniac for letting us know about the subs before I download. 

Other people should take note, rather than just writing comments about their opinion on certain actors or films.

I think i'll watch the film and make my own mind up. Thanks scene4all."

,libertaswv,2012-08-24T22:13Z,"People are watching an action movie w/ Jason Statham and expecting Othello? Would they also rate qual for a cam release by dvdrip standards? It is what it is...Why expect it not to be?

Anyway.... Thx to scene4all and all s/l's... Sincerely appreciated :) "

VOTE FOR RON PAUL 2012 NO MATTER WHAT THE LYING FUCKING PRESS TELLS YOU! The press is trying to choose your next president. Do not fall for it! he government is controlling the press now! Very sad, but true! Go to Youtube and watch ""The Obama Deception"" and youll see the truth. Then tell everyone you know to watch it!! "

,libertaswv,2012-08-26T20:58Z,"Great copy - 10/10 in my book. 9/9 if you're usually picky.

I don't know about the included subs, but i grabbed some from s.scene that were perfect for all the different languages and in perfect sync. I don't remember the release name, but it was a female-ish sounding uploader, and the srt rar was #615787 (meaning, as you look at the rar in your destination folder, that is the number in the rar's name)

Thx again to scene4all and all seeders and leechers - much appreciated!"
,libertaswv,2012-08-26T21:07Z,"btw - The movie was good too. Not sure why people are judging it so harshly. 

If you're looking for a cohesive, solidly paced, well produced action flick - this will do the trick

If you're expecting 'Tree of Life' with the occasional mac-10, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. "

,libertaswv,2012-08-26T23:56Z,"@ elitecrusher: lol at the ron paul thing. 'Mr.Freedom' who wants to legislate his religion and force women to become incubators for the state. No autonomy over their own bodies for women.... LGBT citizens denied the rights of other citizens because of his bigoted religion.... Yeah, he's SO ""freedom"" minded. He's a religious nut, just like the rest of the American Right. Voting for Paul makes republican majority more likely (that's who he caucuses with), so he empowers the MOST anti-citizen political 'party' in all modern history. The system is a sham, and it's participants graded by the degree of their awfulness, but republicans in the US are leading in that regard. The media is owned by the wealthy, and their only political affiliation is that which lines their pocket and prevents information counter to the program from hitting the air - that's why people like yourself are so painfully ignorant. The reason it's gotten so bad is the 1996 Telecommunication Act.. Changed media ownership/regional monopoly rules, and it was done by a republican congress and a dem president. ""The Obama Deception"", lol... Yeah, all this started when Obama took office!! Things were great before that (or, maybe they weren't, and you're only just now getting upset because you're a fucking racist)! lol. It's about the money, you ignorant fool, not the kabuki theater mass-market political labels. It isn't a question of whether they're working against the interests of the lower classes - they ARE - it's only a question of how quickly/completely they put the interests of their masters over our own. elite ""crusher""... You lick the boot of your masters and think you're fightin' the power, lol. This isn't the place for your fucking right wing horseshit. You post garbage, others can't leave it unanswered, and on it goes... Please just shut your perpetually stupid mouth. 

--------

Sorry, scene4all/everyone else. When people let that kind of shit go unanswered it's like silent approval... Hadda say something. Apologies if it exacerbates the off-topic crap.

Already rated the release somewhere above."
