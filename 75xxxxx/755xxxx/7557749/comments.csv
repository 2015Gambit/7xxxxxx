[V],gansuk,2012-08-22T19:53Z,"yeah your right, rippers mistake.
not that it matters as long as it works.

this game looks and plays as bad as it did on the playstation. its more of a fan thing i think."
,nipunb,2012-08-22T20:30Z,"yeah, I just wanted to give the info, of-course this has nothing to do with the game....
about the game, you're right, its definitely a fan thing, I've never played any Final Fantasy game, so I'm not quite interested in this one...."
