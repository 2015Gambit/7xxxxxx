The inhabitants of the small town of Plymouth, Ore. have to evacuate their homes due to an environmental radioactive waste accident. Collectively they move to a moon base. Despite the agreement that no babies should be born there, because of the risks involved, Lunar EVA Worker Gil Eaton (Dale Midkiff), and Doctor Addy Mathewson M.D.---the base's doctor (Cindy Pickett's character)---do get pregnant. And then a solar flare hits the moon and everybody has to seek shelter.
