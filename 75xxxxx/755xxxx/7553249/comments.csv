[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-21T07:30Z,Huh... maybe I'm just not clear on how this is supposed to work. On my end it shows I'm seeding both of my uploads. I hope they're working...
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-21T07:32Z,"TPB still doesn't show me as a seed, even though uTorrent does. Can somebody please let me know if this is correct and/or give me a suggestion for fixing it if it's wrong? Thanks. "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-21T07:46Z,Hey! They're working. Sweet. Clearly people were more interested in Warren Ellis than Ginger Fox... go figure! lol

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-21T10:02Z,"@40ozKilla

Thank you for saying so. Got plenty more planned for future seeding."
