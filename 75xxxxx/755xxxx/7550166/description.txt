For ones with/in doubts, "inner" questions and voyeur tendencies:

Get proper, good torrent-program
with MediaInfo plug-in, NFO viewer plug-in
and STOP asking for things already present.
Or get hell out of my torrents and choose ones you need.

So - here is no waste of dozens KB in page content just to
repeat content of NFO file.

It is not needed anymore.
It's archaic and obsolete.
Doing right-click in your torrent client is easier:

please, seed it for a while and add new working trackers (simply copy and paste it from/in Properties of specific torrents) from my latest torrents (old ones may not work) and point torrent program to place where the content is on your HDD. After Recheck and 100%, seeding will start automatically. If you have done something wrong in doing aforementioned, simply Remove the torrent in question (not the content/data) and start all over again. It is really simple, needs maybe a minute and after few tries you'll get it right.

I do not have files locally since my HDD crash in 2011 and I am waiting for so long for seeders (I am not alone on some).
As usual, unblock my OVH based server (by some PeerBlock list or defective ipfilter list).

Thank you.
