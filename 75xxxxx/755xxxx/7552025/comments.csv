I bought the game from steam - but I missed out on the limited edition bonus dlcs.

I would greatly appreciate it!

Thanks"

,chaote21,2012-08-22T00:13Z,"DOES NOT WORK! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

No, I am not talking about the fact that it stills says 1.3 at the bottom when you start the game, I actually tested this. The lockpicking mini-game is still borked.

The ONLY thing this install accomplished was resetting ALL of my options."

Press up, when it turns green press left"
