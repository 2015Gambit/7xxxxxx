The Scott Horton Show
Wednesday, 22 Aug 2012


[sebaygo1]


Scott's guests today:

Intrepid, globe-trotting journalist Pepe Escobar and Giorgio Cafiero, contributing researcher at Foreign Policy in Focus. Cafiero discusses his recent article, "Syria's Sectarian Echoes in Turkey."

Remember, The Scott Horton Show is now reduced from three hours to two hours in length, and apparently will be live Monday through Wednesday and on Friday. The timeslot on Thursday is taken by the No Agenda show.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
