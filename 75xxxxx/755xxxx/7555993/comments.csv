,Elrim,2012-08-25T04:32Z,"Well, trying it out...

So far the game starts, CivilizationV_DX11 shows no viruses, and the 1.0.1.705 version number shows on the main menu...

Going to start a game, see what turns out"
,Elrim,2012-08-25T14:17Z,"The real deal, flawless game going so far, turn 200 with no problems.

AAAANNNDD I can finally open the mods tab now, so, thanks 3DM group. And jack_mustang for the upload"
,Eep2,2012-08-25T23:21Z,"Fog of war is untextured, stilly laggy as hell even with reduced resolution (1600x900 vs. 1920x1080) and all graphics settings on low/minimal/off with a GeForce GTS 250 1GB, Pentium D 2.8GHz, 4GB RAM system! Plus texture corruption occurs after maybe 10 turns now. Bugged update! Civlization franchise officially dead after this release!"
,Elrim,2012-08-26T03:19Z,"Eep2, I have none of those problems...
Running on an HD6850 1GB, Phenom X4 2.5Ghz, 4GB RAM. Turn 400 (marathon, yeah....) and all is good"
,darthbonobo,2012-08-29T16:16Z,Works perfectly.  Many thanks!

,W3RF,2012-09-05T22:53Z,"After I have copied over the crack and update contents, neither of the .exe files open. Can't seem to get the game to start now.
I'm using cracked gods and kings with v. 1.0.1.674 working fine.

Anything I'm missing?"
,StarR10,2012-09-07T20:46Z,Install tunngle for ONLINE !!!
,600pm,2012-09-15T15:01Z,says I am missing zlib1.dll what do I do?
,jack_mustang,2012-09-15T16:29Z,"@600pm
Download it from here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm

Download the Binaries ZIP. Inside the zip the dll is inside bin folder."
