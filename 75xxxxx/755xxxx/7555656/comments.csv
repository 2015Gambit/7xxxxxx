,Aypolo,2012-08-26T22:33Z,"A native version will run much smoother. Download a native / retail mac version from this website, and don't bother with this torrent."
,slam999,2012-08-29T20:35Z,"Works well, minor video glitches and some rare crashes. The game autosaves every 5 minutes so the crashes are not a big deal. 

To change your resolution, right-click on the Empires application icon and select Show Package Contents. Run Wineskin. Select Set Screen Options. Set resolution to your screen's full resolution. Run the game. Now you can change the games resolution in-game. 

Some unit textures do not load and the units appear black. To fix this change your screen resolution to something else and back again. Textures will reload. "

,slam999,2012-08-31T05:40Z,"It's a stupid game and not worth the download time. The AI is dumb as a brick. On island maps the AI can't land troops with boats, boats just sit on the edge of the map. Glitches cause magic immortal enemies to appear once in a while, one unit that can fight you but you can't kill it. Game crashes 1 in 5 times you win a battle. AI does the same dumb attacks over and over, there's no challenge, it's almost impossible to lose even on hard. All boats pathfinding is crap, your boats jerk around and sometimes get stuck near shores or each other. Some of your units wander around in battle instead of fighting. 

I'd rate the game play 1.5/5 at best. Empires II was way better, they simplified the game play and made it more stupid. "
,ClayMan812,2012-09-01T02:37Z,game sucks and the uploader does 2!
