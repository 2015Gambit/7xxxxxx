These videos (and about 50 others) were uploaded to Demonoid shortly before it was taken offline. This work was carried out by user banjobilly who I believe is also responsible for the video encodes. I will upload all of his kung fu videos (covering a variety of styles) here in five collections. All credit to banjobilly.
