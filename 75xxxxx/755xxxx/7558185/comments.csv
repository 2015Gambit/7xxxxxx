DONE the needful for (Signs.2002.Bluray.480p.H264)

Also means STOPPED for (The.Warriors.Way.2010.BluRay.480p.H264).

BTW, wondering why you requested for Warrier re-seed again in this upload ... coz your OVH as well as several others had completed 100% after my last confirmation.

hope, SIGNS also completes soon ... some 16 fingers seen to be crossed 

:D"

[V],twentyforty,2012-08-24T15:44Z,"Oh, forgotten:

Your comment with asking ""wondering why you requested for Warrier re-seed again in this upload"" was posted some TWENTY hours AFTER my reseed request.

Yes, it was finished in time of YOUR writing - but almost a day AFTER - mine. See?"
,x5x5x71,2012-08-25T03:40Z,You need anything else? Any Other hallfway D/Ls? Someone might have it ...
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-25T07:56Z,"Thank you for every byte seeded. Right now just two oldies are incomplete: old [quark] The.Chronicles.of.Narnia.Trilogy.352p.H264 is stuck on 99.6% and The.Town.2010.EXTENDED.Bluray.720p.H264 on 85.9%. Who knows?

In latest attempt to revive my  old torrents which have died during my year long absence, I visited pages (of my torrents) far back and found how many people loaded year-two old torrent and then been surprised how they're stuck! and screamed right there... on Page 56 for example - instead of reading and listening simple instructions to always ask for reseed in comment section of newest torrents. Do they really cannot read and wont listen, and even think how any uploader looks 1200 torrents back?

We helped dozens with our latest up-seed, my friend, for sure.

If ANYONE, including you - have some movie he likes so much but knows how specific torrent is dead, I will be happy to load that torrent, pull the content to seedbox and then seed long and fast.

People need just to read and stop been uncivilized."
