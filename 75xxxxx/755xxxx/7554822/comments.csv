■ 3D Mode: Select the 3D input format.
“Side by Side” and “Top & Bottom” are available
when the resolution is 720p, 1080i and 1080p in

DTV, HDMI
and USB mode or when set to PC

and the PC is connected through an HDMI/DVI

cable.


3D Auto View (Off / On)


: If 3D Auto View is set to On,

a “Side-by-Side” format HDMI signal with one of the

resolutions below is automatically switched to 3D. Here,
correct 3D information must be sent from the Standard
HDMI 3D Format. "
