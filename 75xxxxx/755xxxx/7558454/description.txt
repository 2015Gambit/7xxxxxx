This show ran a lot longer than both of us were expecting and that is okay! I hope that this really inspires you to just get up and move. While we were mixing this, we had more than a couple of hiccups while recording this show, but we still had fun! I was rather (not really) surprised that this special show ened up a little over 2 hours long.There were a lot of cuts made to this too, so we might be mixing a small mini show for you guys as well.
