,psil0cybn,2012-08-23T01:47Z,"One thing tho...  I mounted and installed the game, but I don't have a mouse cursor... Any ideas? This game is pretty cool, but it really is a pain to play without mouse input. 

I mean I can fly the ship with the mouse, but I don't have a cursor to interact with the rest of the game. Is this normal.  It actually happens a lot with some of the other games that I have downloaded. Common problem?  Any help would be the shiz.."
