Introducing PHISH BITS 3.0, a professionally mixed Phish compilation in the same manner as the official Live Bait series, using the official Live Phish tracks. The producer of this compilation, Mr. Minor, has been a Phish fan since 1993 and has a very extensive collection of Phish recordings. He has decided to make some exciting compilations, exclusively in chronological order, from the Phish 3.0 days, where each subsequent release will not be from concerts earlier than the previous release. There is also a strategic, long term plan to offer very few repeats. For this reason, only the finest of performances will be selected to give you the most epic listening experience possible, from volume to volume. In some cases, large portions of shows will be offered.

As you will notice in the track listing for Volume 01, there are arrows to indicate segues between tracks. Some of these are natural, others are carefully edited to sound like segues. See, for example, the seamless transition between "Beauty of a Broken Heart" from 12/28/09 and "Backwards Down the Number Line" from 7/1/10! These transitions create the feeling of a new kind of show, where the energy moves in ways never before experienced! 

Every volume is made for CD burning, so the length will always be close to 80 minutes. The tracks are high quality MP3 format (at 320 kbps) and have been meta-tagged for your convenience. 

Enjoy!
