[T],HighCode,2012-08-20T16:46Z,"@KeOSG 
You're very welcome.
I seeded over 14 ratio by the time you moaned here.
Some download with 2-3 MB/s, some with 2-3 KB/s lol. Your moaning won't help your download speed ;-)"

,briiianyoung,2012-09-03T06:21Z,"A:8
V:7, I'm not a technical kinda guy, but i don't like cropped video... this obviously has been.
M:4 (unfortunately I've read the book, or I'd have probably given it a 6)
Otherwise, Thx HighCode.  It was worth the D/L, and I'll send for a few more days."
