BBC - Janet Jackson Taking Control [MP4-AAC](oan)
 
http://nimga.com/f/OGQDt.jpg

Emerging from the shadows of the most famous family in showbusiness to become a superstar in 
her own right, Janet Jackson was one of the biggest female pop icons of the 80s and 90s, 
scoring huge international hits with songs such as What Have You Done For Me Lately? and Nasty.

This film examines Janet's phenomenal career, from her early success as a teenage actress in 
hit US sitcom Diff'rent Strokes to multi award-winning pop star rivalling her brother's success 
with ten number one singles on the American Billboard charts and worldwide album sales of over
65 million. The struggle to control both her creative and personal life is central to Janet's 
development as an artist and key to understanding her story - from escaping the clutches of her 
overbearing father to the thirst for new challenges in her groundbreaking collaborations with 
producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Dubbed the 'Queen of Radio' in America, she always seemed 
capable of maintaining her broad-base appeal - until the infamous 2004 American Super Bowl 
appearance alongside Justin Timberlake.

Featuring an exclusive interview with Janet Jackson and contributions from the likes of Jimmy Jam 
Janet's brother Jackie Jackson, actor Deborah Allen and British pop talent Estelle..
