Episode 1 has Paul Snr am choppers drive them the bike.. and this was way back end of 2010

and we only just saw this episode on American choppers in 2012

goes to show how far back the episodes are
like 1 year old LOL

or perhaps they just mix them up.. putting on less interesting content between them fighting and argu-ing scenes on that show comes down to editing i guess :)"
