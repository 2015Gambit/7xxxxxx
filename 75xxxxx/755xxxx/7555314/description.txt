Friday, November 10, 2006 - What You Missed: Gore Vidal
Gore Vidal and his literary executor Jay Parini presided over a sold-out Kaufmann Concert Hall last night. In between dead-on impersonations of Truman Capote, Katherine Hepburn, Tennessee Williams, Clark Gable, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, John Quincy Adams and Frederico Fellini, Gore left us with some memorable quotes on some memorable topics. The subject at-hand was the release of a new book of photographs GORE VIDAL: Snapshots in History's Glare.

This book is Gore Vidal's visual memoir of his remarkable and famously well-lived life. In this collection of photographs, letters, manuscripts, and other selections from Vidal's vast personal archives, readers are now escorted by one of America's wittiest insiders into the Kennedys' Camelot, as well as onto the set of Ben Hur, and into the private lives of Eleanor Roosevelt, Paul Newman, and Tennessee Williams, to name just a few.

Born into public life, here Vidal looks back on his days as an Army officer in WWII, his rise as a groundbreaking and controversial novelist, his years in Hollywood, his forays into the political arena, and his notoriously public triumphs and feuds. Written with Vidal's legendary wit and literary elegance, this book reveals not only the personal reflections of one of the last of the great generation of American writers, but also a captivating social history of the 20th century told by one of our great raconteurs.
