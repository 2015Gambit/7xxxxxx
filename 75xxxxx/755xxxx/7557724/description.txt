As letters of recommendation go, it was not very elaborate, just a
single sentence: ΓÇ£This man is a genius.ΓÇ¥

That was how Carnegie Tech professor R. L. Duffin described
John Nash to the faculty at Princeton University, where Nash entered
as a 20-year-old graduate student in 1948. Within two years,
DuffinΓÇÖs assessment had been verified. NashΓÇÖs ΓÇ£beautiful mindΓÇ¥ had
by then launched an intellectual revolution that eventually propelled
game theory from the fad du jour to the foundation of the
social sciences.
