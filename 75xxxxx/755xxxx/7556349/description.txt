Determining if small vehicles can survive extreme conditions, the guys take three cars deep into Cajun country to hunt with locals, and the driver with the worst car in the end must drive the world's smallest car in his hometown for a day.
 
Release Notes: To keep accuracy with the current season and episode number I have reverted back to season 3 to match tvrage, wiki, and the futon critic listings.
