,babyisme,2012-08-24T17:22Z,is this the latest patch from steam. because i always get the error timeout with mine
,Zz7UPzZ,2012-08-28T04:50Z,"if u already have the game , copy it to a different directory and install this torrent over it it will check and will only download the missing files aka the 1.2 DLC and client etc. "
