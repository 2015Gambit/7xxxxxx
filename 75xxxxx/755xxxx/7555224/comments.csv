,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T20:23Z,"Ironically, you are correct.  Although, on many areas in this book, he leaves out a lot of facts that could bring the reader to many other conclusions - this one, has been pretty much higher up on Ellis's writings.  

Ellis is actually very well known for misrepresenting alot of the information presented about our Founding Fathers - but he doesn't do so by LYING, he just leaves key information out.

One of the reasons why I have included this book (and a few others) in the collection is to note how much many liberals and deconstructionists/revisionists leave out when presenting the whole story.  

Read ""Original Intent"" and ""Jefferson Lies"" and you'll see what I'm talking about.  David Barton gets a lot of crap from the left who don't know their history because they think he's just ""adding"" things that did not exist...  (I mean, how could things like Jefferson not being a diest/athiest be true if the PhD's of the world didn't declare it to be so?  Just because Jefferson made it very clear in a lot of his writings doesn't make it so?...  ummm...  )

Give this one a read...  its actually very good - and again, if you combine it with other reads in the ""Patriots Bookshelf"" you'll actually get a clearer picture on the vision of our founding fathers Academia ""wishes"" you had, vs the True history of our Founding Fathers)"
