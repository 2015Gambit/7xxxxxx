,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-23T23:52Z,"Is everyone commenting a total noob?

There ARE seeders. There are just twice as many people downloading as are uploading. Do the math. Every person uploading is doing so to at least two people.

Begging for seeds does nothing. No one is going to come back to the board for a torrent they've already downloaded, see your request, and then decide to seed if they weren't already doing so.

You're like children. ""MAKE THIS MOVIE I AM GETTING FOR FREE AND EARLIER THAN EVERYONE ELSE GO FASTER FOR ME BECAUSE I WANT IT NOW!""

Get over it, have some patience."

A: 4
M: 10

Just because it is 1920x1080 doesn't mean shit; the video bitrate is 2102kbps and the audio is 93kbps. This is worse quality than streaming a movie online. I downloaded the 16GB version, and guess what the bitrates are? 16411kbps (H264) video, 1536kbps (6 channel) audio. Uploaders need to learn how to specify this shit beforehand so people don't download low quality bullshit."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-08-28T00:09Z,"Ha, so many people bitching and complaining this is crystal clear perfect quality... don't they realize YIFY is known for his extremely low filesizes while maintaining really amazing quality? Is it a perfect BluRay rip? Nope. Go download a 10-20GB file if that's what you want.

Personally i download YIFY's torrents because i happen to feel like watching a movie on my computer when i'm bored, and it only takes me 1-2 hours to d/l... and for that, the quality is amazing.

So stop bitching and whining... if you want a torrent that you can burn onto disc, then play on your fancy entertainment system in surround sound with 3D or whatever, don't be a fucking moron and download the RIGHT torrent. It's not a hard concept."
,TorrentRating,2012-08-29T00:08Z,NOT low quality! By no means as good as the the full bluray but DAMN GOOD. Better than any of the rips under 10GB and takes less room than a full DVD rip. Sound is my only gripe. I wish for 5.1 but the sound here is ok.
