,bp3d,2012-08-25T02:23Z,I can never get the SD DATA files to get recognized on a samsung galaxy s3. Anyone?
,i3utane,2012-08-25T18:53Z,"Thanks for all your uploads.  For anyone with the galaxy S3, you have to create the directory ""opp"" and move the ""sd"" files there.  Did it on mine & it works great.  
Thanks again Bobiras22."

You must put the files in

sdcard/android/obb not data folder but obb and run the game.It will work 100%.

@i3utane

It is obb folder.But yes if you dont have an obb folder you must create it and put it in here.Then it will work 100%"
