,deeshu,2012-08-25T15:35Z,"Hey people! there is a fix that improves the poor performance for ATI/AMD users. Before, I was unable to get more than 20 FPS even with everything low. With the fix, I have everything on High-Amazing and get ~55 FPS.

The trick is in fooling the game into thinking you have nVidia card. Use this utility: http://modsreloaded.com/alternate-d3d9-fix-for-ati-plus-d3d9gen

It's for Fallout: New Vegas but works with Spider-Man as well. Don't use the d3d9.dll file included in the archive. Use the application to generate a new d3d9.dll file, choosing any nVidia card that is close to your real card in performance. Then you simply copy the d3d9.dll file into the game folder.

if you are unable to create a new dll file, try using the one in the archive.

Please note that the dll file will most likely cause the launcher to crash. So you should change your setting in the launcher BEFORE copying the file, exit the launcher, copy the file and then start the game using Game.exe.

Hope that helps!"

,tobu1211,2012-08-28T22:25Z,"So far I have encountered several errors while trying to get this to run!

All steps was followed exactly as is!

1. Clicking the launcher
Launcher opens and settings are set (can only click the start buttong if ressolution is 800x600 4:3??)

2. SKIDROW window pops up and sounds play

3. Nothing?

I did not receive any message from antivirus (using Avast!)
running as administrator
trying the solution where you create another .dll (D3D9.dll) to get rid of FPS drop and laggs.

Anyone have an idea as to why the skidrow window does not startup the actual game?"

,h1vem1nd,2012-08-28T22:43Z,"The game doesn't crash for me, and the crack works fine.

I only have one problem: I can't change the in-game settings. I can't turn on subtitles, can't change the audio levels, can't adjust the hotkeys. Any suggestions?"
,h1vem1nd,2012-08-29T02:21Z,"Oh, hell, nevermind. You have to hit Space to access the settings sub-menus. Weird control scheme.

Any possibility of DLC for this. All I want to try is Stan Lee DLC. I couldn't wait for this on PC (I wasn't even gonna touch a download until extremezone uploaded) so I bought it on 360 but not preorder :( Does anyone know if the Stan Lee is going to release as DLC for 360 or PC?

PS: I liked this game, but I am after-all a spider-man fan. I must say I was a little disappointed at how quickly I got thru it. 8/10 for this game! :)"

,magallium,2012-09-05T03:06Z,"ok sry here are my specs:

OS:  Windows 7
Graphics:  Intel(R) HD Graphics
Processor:  Intel Core i7-2600 @ 3.4 GHz with 4 physical CPU Cores
RAM:  16 GB
Direct X 11"

,colinb74,2012-09-05T05:51Z,"@magallium - Ok your Specs for your graphics. I am guessing this is integrated graphics chip, yes? In other words, on-board graphics - chips that are built into your mobo. 1GB of video memory? I am just having a stab in the dark here but did you consider that your GPU isn't up to the job, maybe the game just doesn't launch for you because of this? Did you try lowering settings in the launcher? Maybe try to do this from the launcher if you have not already, and launch the game from the launcher... You still get the SKIDROW splash screen but the same again, you just hit esc once and it loads. Lets try to get this happening for you. Your system otherwise looks fine to run the game. Graphics in my opinion is more than likely the issue. Get back quick! :D"

,jjacks81,2012-09-10T07:14Z,When i open the game all that comes up is an annoying intro for Skidrow. No game ever comes up. Ive used many games with the same install procedure and have not had problems before. What am i missing here?

,Jeb123,2012-09-13T08:09Z,I downloaded the game. Installed it cracked it everything is working fine. Used the d3d9 mod suggested on page 5 to correct my fps on a Radeon card. That worked as well. I fee like i could run it on near high graphics but my PC simply isn't good enough. Sadly the game doesn't have a built in graphic setting menu... Can anyone help me get the game down to medium graphics or lower so i can get better fps?
,ricvt,2012-09-14T07:36Z,"If you use the d3d9 mod, I think you only have to put the files like they were before you installed the mod. So, you open the laucher, change the graphic settings and use the mod again."
