So I was just curious what makes a video file specifically a iPod/Zune/PSP one.  I made this account pretty much just so i could ask this question so if ne1 could clear this up please do so:-)"

,Sphenisciphile,2012-08-24T02:50Z,"Usually ""handheld"" videos are at lower resolution & bitrate for handheld devices. Some handhelds will only play certain file formats (and specific codecs and settings within that format). One of mine will play many formats, but for mp4, for example, it will only play H.264, and not x264. Which is an example of the difference between a CODEC and a container.

This TPB video category predated the profusion of so many handhelds which can play hi-def material."
