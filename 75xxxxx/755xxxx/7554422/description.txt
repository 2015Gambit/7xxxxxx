"At long last An Anarchist Frequently Asked Questions (AFAQ)
has moved from the Internet onto the printed page . . . it is
likely to be the primary source anarchists turn too for
information about anarchist theory and history . . . . It is
accessible, not laden with jargon but also built on ten years
and more of solid research . . . The structure of the book is
such that it is easy to dip into . . . this [is a] comprehensive
resource. The prefix to the book is 'An' Anarchist FAQ. The
collective is too modest. This is the place to go to find
out about anarchist ides, theory and practice. It is accessible
and based on sound research. Thoroughly recommended."
