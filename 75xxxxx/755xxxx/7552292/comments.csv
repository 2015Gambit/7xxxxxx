 If anyone knows anything, please comment so I can get this thing rolling."
,roguebond,2012-08-21T02:13Z,"The reason I uploaded it is because I am trying to get this thing to work on my iPad but when I go to the only available link on Installous it redirects me to some bullshit ad and I can't download the file. 
 So, I downloaded it on my mac and converted it into a torrent file. So, I'm hoping to access the torrent file straight from my iPad through a Torrent client I found through Cydia.
 If I transfer the app straight from iTunes to my iPad, it shows up but won't open. ???????????"
