Perez Prado and his Orchestra - Kuba Mambo 1947-1949 (Tumbao) [FLAC] {MKOP}

''The most commercially successful mambo artist of the 1940s, '50s and '60s, Damaso Perez Prado got his start in the late '30s as an arranger and pianist for one of Cuba's most influential dance bands, the Orquesta Casino de la Playa. In the late '40s Prado set off on his own and quickly became known as the architect of the "mambo" dance craze, and one of the most popular latin american artists in the world.'' 

Early works by the best-known mambo bandleader of all time. After graduating from the Orquesta Casino de la Playa, pianist-arranger Prado started his own band. Rough-hewn, punchy, blaring brass dominates on these recordings, though it is often balanced with sexy percussion. Prado's piano work is often sloppy -- you can hear him faltering while he improvises. But the arrangements are intriguing-- Prado experimented with creative rhythmic and melodic ideas which were definitely ahead of the other Cuban dance music of the time. This disc is also interesting to Prado fans for its early versions of songs which would be re-worked into much smoother form, such as "Mambo #5". A nice look at Prado's early career. ~Slipcue
