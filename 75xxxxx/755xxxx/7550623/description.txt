Laser 2R, new concept of PuzzleGame, terribly addictive!
Lite vers., 16 levels!

Laser 2R is a new concept of PuzzleGame, terribly addictive.
2R for Reflection (as this will put a strain on your neuronnes) and Reflection (since you'll have to use the reflection of a laser to achieve a level).

Excellent to deal with when you have a little free time, Laser 2R offers a challenge constantly renewed with hundreds of levels with Full Version (currently 360)!

The goal: to direct the laser to its end point by moving blocks. When two blocks of the same color are put together diagonally they form a mirror that will guide the laser in a new direction.
Do not expect an easy game! No doubt you will manage to finish all Easy levels. But can you finish all Medium levels, not to mention the challenge of Difficult mode!

And even when you will come to unlock everything, can you finish them with the minimum number of moves for each level and get all perfects?

Have fun!
