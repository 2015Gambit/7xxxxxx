Thanks again for checking them out, and you're most welcome.

Yeah, see, the thing is, I don't really know what I'm doing yet. Not sure if I should seed so many things at one time, how long I should leave them if a lot of other people start seeding, or to what degree I should open up my bandwidth. My ISP will get in my business if I go over 250 GB per month (they have in the past), so for now I'm only doing 100 kbps for all my seeds. To me that's making it look like all of them are going a bit slow. But hey! That means somebody wanted them, and here they are! After I get a better idea of what I should be doing I may open up the bandwidth floodgates a bit more."
