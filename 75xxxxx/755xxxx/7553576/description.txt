Ginger Fox

A four-issue mini-series published by Comico in 1988.

Written by Mike Baron (Nexus, Badger, Epic Illustrated, Punisher & a ton of other 
books) with incredibly original and unique art brought to you by The Pander Bros. 
(it's in the same style as their work on Grendel: Devil's Legacy, but with even 
thicker lines and brighter colors), it's a surreal take on getting a Hollywood movie made in the 80s, along with all the excesses you might imagine that would entail. Unlike anything else I had read at the time, it was something that only a company like Comic (RIP) could have published.

It was also a "sequel" of sorts to "The World of Ginger Fox", which can be read for free online, right here...
