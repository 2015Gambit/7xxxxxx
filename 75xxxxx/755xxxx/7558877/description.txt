What if everything you thought was funny about DeadpoolΓÇªwas actually just disturbing?

What if he decided to kill everyone and everything that makes up the Marvel Universe?

What if he actually pulled it off? 

Writer Cullen Bunn, with art by Dalibor Talajic, is telling one of the wildest Deadpool tales in years, tearing down the 4th wall like nobodys business.

Deadpool no longer cares, and heΓÇÖs going to kill every single hero and villain in the Marvel Universe.
