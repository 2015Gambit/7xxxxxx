,Cheops75,2012-08-27T04:31Z,it works well. Retro_Geek doesn't know what the hell he is talking about. 
,Inter69,2012-08-31T22:17Z,"It does not work with Comical 0.8.
However there is an EASY FIX as follows.
1) rename the cbr file extension to rar
2) in Winrar extract the pages to a subdirectory
3) create a new rar in winrar but use compression STORE (not normal)
4) rename the new rar to cbr
Thats all folks."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-09-02T12:12Z,"Orrrr, just use Comic Book Reader, available here:  http://www.cbrreader.com/

Orrrrr, CDDisplay, available here:  http://www.cdisplayex.com/

Orrrrrr, unzip the files (using WinZip  http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm  , or 7-Zip  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html  (Hint:  7-Zip is Free!)) and use Windows Photo Viewer, etc.

Orrrrrrrr,...."

Stupidity is a real problem this day and age.  Many people you know are battling with this disease daily, and they could even be loved ones or relatives.  

The best thing you can do is let them know you're there for them, and that they can feel safe knowing you will bitch-slap some fucking sense into their heads, just like Greek needed."
