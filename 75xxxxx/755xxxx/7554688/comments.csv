,Neraforesta,2012-08-21T22:32Z,Nothing new. Same as the others released yesterday. A7 V6...for cam. Cropped top and bottom so your still missing the tops of peoples heads during dialog.
,Neraforesta,2012-08-21T22:49Z,ps...not watchable. Heads cut off most of the movie. Looks to be the same person as The Watch. Wish he had a clue.

Would not recommend. Skip this and get something else."
