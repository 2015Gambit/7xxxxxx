,Taikalasit,2012-08-21T13:03Z,Hardcoded subs for the Russian bits?
,micron66,2012-08-21T16:42Z,"@Taikalasit

if you would have clicked on ""files"" at the top,you would have known the answer to your question - 

SUBS/Dutch.srt
SUBS/English (Foreign Parts Only).srt
SUBS/English.srt

so,not hardcoded.

,hexrider2,2012-09-01T00:44Z,"so disappointed, this does not wokr on the PS3.  tried remuxing w/ mp4box & still no go.  
plays fine on the computer & qualty looks excellent tho!  "
,CyPhErLoUs,2012-09-02T00:30Z,I got it playing on the PS3 using PS3 Media Server from my Ubuntu laptop but have to use all types of weird settings to make it work. Deleting this one and finding an MKV version.
