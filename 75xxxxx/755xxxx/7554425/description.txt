 Around Sound Pro allows you to listen to music and still be aware of your surroundings.
What it does:
*PRO Version ONLY* Street Mode:ΓÇ¿
+Walk down the street and only hear the noises above the set trigger level. Never interrupts your music.
Pause Music Mode:ΓÇ¿

+Uses your headset's microphone to listen for loud noises and pause your music if one is detected, then play back the sound that triggered the pause and continues for a short period of time the optionally resumes your music.

Where would I use it?ΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿
At the office: pause your music automatically when someone is trying to get your attention
At home: Don't miss door slams, children crying, your dog barking, or other warning signsΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿
At the airport: Relax at the gate and have your music pause when the gate announcements startΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿
Anywhere relatively quiet where you want to know if something happens around you


What's in this version: (Updated : Aug 21, 2012)

    New: Use with games! Non-pause mode works best. Request your favorite game to support Around Sound's Pause Mode!
    New Timeout Options: Adjust timeout duration and volume - Pro or Timeout Options Upgrade needed.
    Fixed swipeable-ness (real word?..) of the sound meter trigger adjustment so it doesn't move the whole tab
    V2.07: Bug Fixes

Required Android O/S : 2.2+
