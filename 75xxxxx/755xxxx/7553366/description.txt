Here's the complete DVD and CD set for SuSE Linux 8.2 Professional. Over 2500+ pkgs. Version right before Novell purchased the company. This is the good stuff. Never failed on me once. I had a couple of crashes in the GUI but the system is solid and respectable. Thank you SuSE Linux team. We love you and thank you for your most comprehensive operating system solution! All the best!

SuSE Linux 8.2 - version Linux "all in one", it is designed for ambitious home users who want a rich and easy to use set of desktop applications. SuSE Linux 8.2 attaches great attention to ease of use, so we have included in the distribution the latest KDE 3.1. Now home users who want to try "to taste" the reliability and security of Linux, smogun easily go to that platform. A wide range of recent applications and tools to Linux allows the user to enjoy a fully Open Source operating system.

Very stable operating system and is well known components. Would squeeze the maximum out of iron.
In this version rose even Oracle 10g for linux, and it requires nucleus compatibility with Oracle.

Scripts Bash-shell USING the classical rules, but not like SuSe 10.x. Also, does not require a DVD-ROM, but CD-ROM.
