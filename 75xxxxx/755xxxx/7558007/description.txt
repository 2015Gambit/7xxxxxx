Maitland's Vertebral Manipulation 7th 2005

Physiotherapists are being called upon increasingly by medical practitioners to help patients recover from episodes of uncomplicated or simple/mechanical spinal disorders. Manipulative Physiotherapy, it is clear, has an important role to play within the recovery and rehabilitation process.
The ability to identify and deal with spinal segmental mobility impairment, neurodynamic dysfunction and muscle imbalance, for example, requires finely tuned
skills of clinical examination, clinical reasoning and technically accurate and effective treatment techniques. 
The Maitland Concept has been one of the cornerstones of modern manipulative physiotherapy. Those who have been privileged enough to see Geoff Maitland at work will know how much thought and detail goes into the application of each individual technique of examination, mobilisation or manipulation. Having the opportunity to see and practice techniques performed in an expert way can only serve to help any clinician to understand and apply manipulative phYSiotherapy methods more effectively in the clinical setting.
