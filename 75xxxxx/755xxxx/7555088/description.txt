Weight of the Nation Season 1

Three years in the making, The Weight of the Nation brings together the country's leading research institutions in a national initiative to help shed light on solutions to restore our individual and collective health. The centrepiece of The Weight of the Nation is the 4-part documentary series that features case studies and interviews with experts as well as individuals and families struggling with obesity. Each part focuses on a particular issue: "Consequences," examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese; "Choices," reveals the science behind obesity and weight loss; "Children in Crisis," documents the impact the epidemic is having on the nation's children; and "Challenges," examines the major forces behind the obesity epidemic.
Parts 5 to 16 are a collection of 12 films ranging in length from 11 to 30minutes each part focuses on a particular issue.



13)  Biology of Weight Loss 
This bonus short follows Nola, a participant in a study examining the reasons it's so hard to keep weight off after losing a significant amount. The Columbia University scientists behind the NIH-supported study, Dr. Rudolph Leibel and Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, have been researching the effects of the hormone leptin on weight maintenance. Their work on the underlying mechanisms controlling weight may one day help us better understand why it's so hard to lose weight and keep it off.
