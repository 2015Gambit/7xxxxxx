If you ever download my torrents, remember either, its cause my laptops off, or theres enough seeders to keep it going. Just comment if you ever need a seed."
,BZant,2012-08-23T00:00Z,I find it very rude that Quite a few of you have downloaded this torrent fully and are not torrenting. Please torrent. Otherwise this torrent will die. And there are a LOT of leechers. I dont want to be the only one seeding. It stresses my internet out. Please seed and help

,BZant,2012-08-24T02:32Z,You're talking about the Swan Song correct? It wont  install UNLESS you run your computer through japanese system locale. I dont believe you can use applocale to RUN the installer. But after its installed you can run the game through applocale. If you have no idea what im talking about then just google. Or view the installer in this torrent. It explains what you need to do. Hope this helps.
