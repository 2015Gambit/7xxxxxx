[V],Cyberpiraten,2012-08-23T19:57Z,It should work on every version that Adobe says it works on. Google it. 
,bryman44,2012-08-23T21:20Z,"Any reason to why the Host Patch won't open? Double-click it, it performs the 'opening gesture' but nothing comes up?"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2012-08-23T21:27Z,"hmm that's strange man! 
just open terminal and enter: ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts""

then add the following lines below. Hope it work's out for ya. Peace.

,robyn55,2012-08-23T21:52Z,i also tried what you just told him to do and it didn't work
[V],Cyberpiraten,2012-08-23T22:05Z,Are you sure the host patch didn't work? Cause on my macbooks i dobble click on it and it works just fine. Do you have a password or not? 
,bryman44,2012-08-23T22:13Z,"I'll try that right now, thanks."
,robyn55,2012-08-23T22:17Z,
,robyn55,2012-08-23T22:18Z,"yeah i do have a password.. this is what happened exactly, i copy pasted the ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts"" on the terminal, it asked for my password and i put it, then a hosts file opened and i copied # block . . . . . . . . there and saved it."

,robyn55,2012-08-23T22:32Z,i'll try again though..

,robyn55,2012-08-23T22:38Z,bryman44 did it work with you? it didn't work for me
,ksharif,2012-08-23T23:58Z,"After i open /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit  i cant find /etc/hosts , what should i do ?"

,bryman44,2012-08-24T03:54Z,"Got it working using the extra steps involving using the Terminal!

Robyn: try uninstalling the app, and run terminal prior to installing. you should be able to run the ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts"""
,iptp,2012-08-24T08:13Z,Thanks a bunch for the torrent - works fine on Mountain Lion for me. Seeded 20GB this far... :)
,robyn55,2012-08-24T14:44Z,i'm desperately needed for detailed help. still can't get Hoste patch to open. anyone? iptp.. how did you get hoste patch to open?
,thurley,2012-08-24T15:32Z,"I have had just as much trouble with this The Host does not run, the /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts does not exist. Rather frustrating."
,thurley,2012-08-24T15:51Z,I have tried this 4 different times in all the ways you suggested. Fail.
,robyn55,2012-08-24T15:56Z,thanks i'll try
,robyn55,2012-08-24T15:57Z,and yes i failed too.
[V],Cyberpiraten,2012-08-24T16:25Z,"The Host file is simply to make shure the app does not connect their servers, you could maybe block the app in the firewall? 

Anyhow, the Host Patch is working fine on all our's Macbook Pro's.  

You could try this, almost the same just with a little twist.

Peace.

I have opened terminal and type text.  When it asks for my password, it will not allow me to actually type anything.  Not sure how to get this to work.  Loving all the help though.  "
,Bynx,2012-08-25T01:42Z,Everything is fine but the HOST PATCH doesnt work. When I click it nothing happens. I skipped this part and installed the folder in the next step and ran the program. All this while offline. Everything worked fine. Now to just get the HOST PATCH to work.
,Bynx,2012-08-25T13:38Z,Until the Host Patch works you have to remain offline whenever Photoshop is open and that will only last 7 days at which time it will shut down. Without that Host File this whole thing is useless.
[V],Cyberpiraten,2012-08-27T01:32Z,"I'll try making a script file of this, I'll upload it asap."
,Bynx,2012-08-28T03:52Z,How about just uploading the Host File? Maybe it got corrupted.
,Lavenza,2012-08-28T04:06Z,I used the Automator and rewrote the Host File with the lines Ciberpiraten commented. I was then able to run it. Photoshop CS6 now works perfectly when t he internet is on :)
,Bynx,2012-08-28T23:24Z,"Not being a programmer I havent got a clue what this means ... Paste the the following text below between 127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost...
What is localhost and broadcasthost? And where are they?"
,Bynx,2012-08-28T23:31Z,Lavenza how about uploading your Host File?
,Lavenza,2012-08-29T04:05Z,"I'll try to write the steps that worked for ME as simple as I can :
1. Open Automator (It was already installed on my MAC since someone owned it before me, but I don't know if you have to download it?)
2. There will be a window asking to 'Choose a type for your document'...Click 'Open and existing document' and pick the Host Patch
3.You should see the script of the Host Patch written in purple in a box, from there the third line is # Block Adobe Activation, so copy the bunch of lines Cyberpiraten commented (including the # Block Adobe Activation) and replace the ones found in the script (SO from '# Block Adobe Activation' to '127.0.0.1	wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com')
3. Save and close Automator
4. The Host Patch should now work, you can open it (it'll ask your user password) but really all it does is show you the script again so you don't need to do anything else with it.
5. Proceed the installation and instructions

I'm no programmer or genius in the matter so I hope this helps! It worked for me, can't 100% promise it will for everybody... Goodluck!"

For those who cannot open Hoste Patch.

MODIFYING HOST FILE:

You can easily modify Host file by yourself.
First, find the Host file on your MAC.
Finder>Go>Go to Folder (shift+cmmd+G)
Type ->  /etc/hosts
Is this the file that you needs to modify but the system doesn't let you do this.
Them, copy and paste and now you can modify.

I will put exactly how the file needs to be . Just select all and paste.

Save and just Drag and Drop inside the ""etc"" folder. Authenticate and Replace.
ps: make a copy of the original if you feel better."

,aldo45,2012-09-05T16:57Z,"Works perfectly. Thanks Uploader. Before doing this make a BACKUP of your hosts file by opening Finder SHIFT+CMD+G then /private/etc/hosts. Copy the file to another location so you have a safety net.
THEN:

1) copy hosts posted on page 2 by uploader
2) Open Automator
3) Open Existing file>Hostes Patch
4) Delete whats in the purple part from #block Adobe TO 127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com 
5) Paste the stuff copied from here into the file
6) Save it
8) DISCONNECT FROM INTERNET COMPLETELY!!!
9) Run the .DMG
10) Click 'I have a serial""
11) Use one of the serials from the .rtf provided.
12) Install will finish then click CLOSE
13) Run the Hostes Patch file you edited earlier. You'll need to supply your admin password to grant it permission to run.
14) Next, go to Finder>Applications>Photoshop CS6 and right click on the app.
15) Show Package Contents>Frameworks
16) copy the folder ""Amtlib.framework"" which is included in the download.
17) Close everything
18) Reboot
19) Done.

For those having problems, restore the BACKUP Hosts file you made to /private/etc/hosts. Then make a fresh backup before you try again.

Make sure to paste the text between 127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost : - That's important.

If all else fails just download TEXTMATE and edit the host file with that. It's the same thing essentially."

,soulb1ade,2012-09-12T07:04Z,I have managed to update this version to 13.01 without any problem. I went http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=5407 and get the file and install it.
