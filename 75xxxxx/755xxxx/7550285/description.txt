King Bruce & The Black Beats - Golden Highlife Classics From the 1950s and 1960s, Ghana (Retroafric) [FLAC] {MKOP}

'Boy those days really were golden if you judge them by the warm and affectionate glow that emanates from this music. Their swing and jazz-influenced highlife is very 'Chugga Chugga' ~The Beat (USA)

Although it's imperfect, Golden Highlife Classics is a good collection of King Bruce & the Blackbeats' classic recordings from the '50s and '60s. Since there are so few CD-era compilations of his material available, this is the introduction by default, but it's not a bad one, since it does capture the essence of the group's infectious dance sound.~Stephen Thomas Erlewine (Allmusic)

'Bruce formed the BBs in 1952, fronting a guitar/bass/drums combo with a luxurious spread of horns that now have all the acoustic properties of a Thirties 78, a vintage crispness that's no bad thing when you're whirling around to such quaint confections today'~Q Magazine
