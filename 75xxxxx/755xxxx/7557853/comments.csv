,Bigthickd,2012-08-23T16:52Z,I started downloading this torrent a little more than 15 hours ago and I am at 92% completion. My torrent browser says that this torrent file is at 0.924 availability which means this is all that I can get of the file. Is there any way that you can re-seed this torrent. Please....?
