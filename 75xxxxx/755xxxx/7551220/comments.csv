,Fangular,2012-08-25T22:10Z,"I watched this show as it aired and I was just wondering what you thought of it, 2040 (seeing as how you, like me, were such a big fan of Life on Mars (the original, of course!), which this show was vaguely reminiscent of). I tried to like it, but was ultimately very disappointed.. but what did you think of it?"
