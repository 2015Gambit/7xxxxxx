You know those games where there are platforms scattered across a really tall tower, and you have to jump up them without falling off and you move automatically left and right and you have to just time the jumps? It's one of those. Also, it has fighting game matches in between stages.

I can't find any other information or download link for this, even on the website I originally found it on. I only found it while googling a .dll that apparently is only used for this and one other game that doesn't even work.

Platformer controls: z to charge jump, release z to jump.
Fighter controls: z to throw spears, x to jump, double tap arrow keys to dash. Arrow keys to move.

If you have any information about this game, please leave it in the comments, because I have a burning desire to know about just WTF is going on with this >_
