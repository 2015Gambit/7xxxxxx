In case people don't know what this is ?

i'm pretty sure if you delete ei.cfg inside the Windows 7 or 8 iso that would make your Pro (for example)
a Pro / Ultimate / etc (all in one) disc image"
,luciferxe,2012-08-23T01:55Z,"You are quite right xpmule.

Just simply open the iso in most compression applications and remove ei.cfg. Then you will have all the options. "
,xpmule,2012-08-23T04:10Z,"cool then i heard correct..
i've never done that before but i read some chat about doing that at MDL forums"
