,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-25T05:32Z,"for anyone having trouble watching this in 3D on their 3D HDTV, like i was when playing on a laptop connected to my 3D HDTV via HDMI.. check your TV settings

■ 3D Mode: Select the 3D input format.
“Side by Side” and “Top & Bottom” are available
when the resolution is 720p, 1080i and 1080p in

DTV, HDMI
and USB mode or when set to PC

and the PC is connected through an HDMI/DVI

cable.


3D Auto View (Off / On)


: If 3D Auto View is set to On,

a “Side-by-Side” format HDMI signal with one of the

resolutions below is automatically switched to 3D. Here,
correct 3D information must be sent from the Standard
HDMI 3D Format. "

,xchungfoo,2012-08-29T00:30Z,thanks for the awesome movie works well but i cant get the settings right on the sbs ghosting seems more than should be also whenever i play it through powerdvd it looks outrageously good but only when it uses powerdvds built in 3d mode but it will only play a second than it reverts back to normal either way is there a better player with built in 3d for this type of file or will i have to watch the ghosty job my tv is doing on its own....any input would be appreciated and thanks again for the awesome upload

,Adriesk,2012-09-15T06:10Z,"This didn't play on my Sony bluray player through my 1TB Toshiba External HD. I have no reason why because some HSBS 3D MKV files like Piranha 3DD, etc. work gr8. The bluray player says File is corrupted or unsupported. I don't understand. Can someone please tell me whats the problem and is there any way i can resolve it. Thanks a lot."

,xteamdown,2012-09-15T12:53Z,"Adriesk try changing the video format to one of those movies which worked on your sony blu ray. Use some software which  can change the format of the video.

I have the same issue on some of there movies on my sony blu ray but then i play it through my laptop using its HDMI out."
,Adriesk,2012-09-15T18:35Z,"@xteamdown : some hsbs 3d mkv files worked and this is also a hsbs 3d mkv file so i dont understand why it doesnt work. As for connecting my laptop to hdtv via hdmi, i tried this but the video never gets full screen and let alone, the 3d function says not available when i try to turn on 3d mode and switch to side by side. May i know what software you use to play the mkv through pc to tv via hdmi ? Thanks."
,xteamdown,2012-09-16T20:39Z,"@Adriesk I observed when the video resolution is 1080 the sony bluray has issues playing the file from external hard disk. But when the same file is less video resolution say 800 or 720 the file is play able. Try downgrading the resolution to be sure. Try the same movie. Save a 2-3 minute of the same video & use some software to re encode it in lower resolution & it should be playable. (Just experiment once)

To play movie in full screen on tv while playing through pc, try choosing the option from your display settings where to display the video on external display only. Look into your pc's display settings you'll find something there. 
The setting on my laptop when i connect it to tv via hmdi cable lets me choose from 'duplicate' 'extended' or 'projector only' mode. When i choose projector only while watching movie the full screen problem is solved. Try it it'll work for u as well.

I use simple Windows media player or vlc to play movies on tv via hmdi cable from my pc. I choose the side-by-side 3D mode from tv options to play 3d."
,Adriesk,2012-09-16T23:54Z,@Xteamdown: Thanks for the info and gr8 advice. I will try it. :)
