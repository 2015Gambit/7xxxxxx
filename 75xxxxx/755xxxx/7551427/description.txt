This is probably the best copy of this album available on the net, taken from etree (id=511177). Unfortunately the pitch on that copy was a bit flat on all tracks except the filler (which has nothing to do with the album but was kept for some historical reason), so I've repaired them and posted the result here. Enjoy!
