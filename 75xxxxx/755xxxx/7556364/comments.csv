,mcrackin1,2012-08-23T06:42Z,"So is the movie worth it? Seems like a budget film, no ratings anywhere."
,tilapia,2012-08-24T01:04Z,not good

Pray for a better story.
Pray for better acting."
,dfl3506,2012-08-24T01:25Z,"A10, V10 I gave it 15min purely because it's set in Thailand and that's where I live. It's a low budget, badly acted ""made for TV"" movie . Anyone who calls this ""incredible"" has severe brain damage."
,skivijimmy,2012-08-24T08:46Z,Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!! Must see Movie.. The country of Thailand sucks big time but still was an INCREDIBLE movie
,Greggo79,2012-08-24T18:41Z,"Yhea, I totally thought this was a different movie. I was thinking of The Beach with Leonardo DiCaprio. I watched part of this one and it's crap. Terrible acting. Don't waste your time."

,dfl3506,2012-08-25T03:23Z,"skivijimmy You're a total fuckwit, Thailand is a great country, I live there so I should know."
,rez90r,2012-08-25T07:24Z,"@ dfl -  you live 'there'? If you lived 'there' shouldn't have you said 'I live here'. Full of shit, u live in the folds of your mommaz back fat."
,dfl3506,2012-08-25T07:43Z,"skivijimmi You know fuck-all about grammer. I live in Pattaya, Nongprue, Chonburi, Thailand 20150 you dipshit. Get an atlas out, you probably don't know where Thailand is dickwad."

,dfl3506,2012-08-25T07:57Z,rez90r You know shit. I've been living in Thailand for three years while you still live in the basement of your mommas house jerking off to boy band videos.
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2012-08-25T08:45Z,AV 9/10 Great quality work & movie is worth watching. Thanks !!!!
,vergisima,2012-08-25T13:08Z,"@dfl, @rez:
dfl also said ""THAT's where I live."" Same issue deictically: this/that, here/there. say dfl's on VACATION in Cambodia, but s/he LIVES in Thailand;"
,sunnyape,2012-08-25T13:38Z,"Decent quality for the size. A=8, V=7.

If you like your made for Christian TV movies with a heavy dose of salvation through divine intervention, then M=6. If not, M=3.

Oh no baddie. Whatever you do, don't walk backwards whilst not watching where you're going. That's always a sure way to tread on one of the aforementioned animal traps that were not so subtly mentioned in an earlier scene. Look out. IT'S RIGHT THERE. Snap-O. Too late! 

Look out other baddie. Whatever you do don't ignore the man running up almost directly in front of you with a big stick while all you have is an automatic rifle. That's a sure way to get hit on the head! Look, he's right next to you. SHOOOOOT! Whack-O. Too late!!!

Let's hope they don't have a sudden scene change that serves to contrast the violence of man with the peace of G*d's kingdom. Surely there won't be an expected close-up of a small animal in harmony with its surroundings? Stick-Insect-On-A-Rock-O. Too late!!!!!"
,dubblue4,2012-08-25T17:17Z,"thanks for the up, but the film is awful. yet another jesus saves shite. "
