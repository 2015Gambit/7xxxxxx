Official Windows 7 images from Technet combined into one image to make an all in one (AIO) image. This is Windows 7 with service pack 1.

Here is what we combined:

Windows 7 Starter
Windows 7 Home Basic (x86&x64)
Windows 7 Home Premium (x86&x64)
Windows 7 Professional (x86&x64)
Windows 7 Enterprise (x86&x64)
Windows 7 Ultimate (x86&x64)

That is 11 editions in one image! Burn it to a USB flash drive or DVD  and then you can install whatever version you want from the crappy Starter, to the OK home versions, to the awesome Ultimate!

Please comment and SEED FOREVER!
