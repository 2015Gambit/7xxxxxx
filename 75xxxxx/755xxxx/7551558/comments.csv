So I just install vida, and then the patch under C?
How about SQL server? "
,kispaci,2012-08-20T22:23Z,"Ronny: yes, install VIDA to the default folder (C:/VIDA) and then run this.

The script will create usernames in SQL DB."
,kispaci,2012-08-20T22:29Z,"hmmm I don't see my previous comment.

Ronny: yes, you need to install to the default folder then run this. 
The script will create the users in DB."
,ronny3000,2012-08-20T22:50Z,"Kispaci, it seems to be working, i got in alright, but when I press the read vehicle button theres a popup window that tells that something is wrong, and a lot up scripts that I dont understand. And another popup that tries to connect

,kispaci,2012-08-20T22:57Z,"Ronny: rename or delete C:/VIDA/WslLogin.exe file. (may you see the result immediately, may need to restart your computer)"
,ronny3000,2012-08-20T23:04Z,And TPB comment engine is what? :-)

,kispaci,2012-08-20T23:14Z,"Piratebay...this site (The Pirate Bay TPB :))



one more important thing: may you need to upgrade DiCE's firmware. The VIDA will inform you before you start to read your vehicle."
