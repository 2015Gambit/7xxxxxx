,WraithCross,2012-08-28T08:21Z,"Hey RougeGamer22, just making a nice suggestion to help with this torrent. If you want the people who downloaded this early on during the original release of this torrent, release a second torrent with the DLC's, and just slowly build it up in segments, like all the currents, then when more are released, add them to another, and keep going like that. Keep you organized, and keep your fellow gamers happy"
,miraculix13,2012-08-28T13:45Z,adri1... Use winrar. 
,RougeGamer22,2012-08-29T06:13Z,"@WraithCross   Sorry dude and thanks for the advice. definitly want happy gamers. in the process of getting leviathon now, should have it in next few hours and will do as you suggested


@adri1   just use winrar man I thought that was common knowledge in the pirate world. not everything comes out as an ISO"
