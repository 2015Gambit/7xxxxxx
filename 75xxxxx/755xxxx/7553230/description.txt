America has been at war for over a decade now, with millions of soldiers having seen death and dying up close in Afghanistan and Iraq. But most Americans, watching comfortably on their TVs and computers, witness mostly to statistics, stump speeches, and ΓÇ£expertΓÇ¥ rhetoric, donΓÇÖt get whatΓÇÖs really going on there. Bill talks to Karl Marlantes ΓÇö a highly-decorated Vietnam veteran, Rhodes Scholar, author, and PTSD survivor ΓÇö about what we on the insulated outside need to understand about the minds and hearts of our modern warriors. Marlantes shares with Bill intimate stories about how his battlefield experiences both shaped and nearly destroyed him, even after returning to civilian life.

ΓÇ£ΓÇÖThou shalt not killΓÇÖ is a tenet you just do not violate, and so all your young life, thatΓÇÖs drilled into your head. And then suddenly, youΓÇÖre 18 or 19 and theyΓÇÖre saying, ΓÇÿGo get ΓÇÿem and kill for your country.ΓÇÖ And then you come back and itΓÇÖs like, ΓÇÿWell, thou shalt not killΓÇÖ again. Believe me, thatΓÇÖs a difficult thing to deal with,ΓÇ¥ Marlantes tells Bill. ΓÇ£You take a young man and put him in the role of God, where he is asked to take a life ΓÇö thatΓÇÖs something no 19-year-old is able to handle.ΓÇ¥
