Did you cut back on those or any textures? I noticed the extractor extracted iPad textures which are only 1024x1024, and this should be 2048x2048, but I can't really tell if those were cut back or not.

There's not graphical options in any menus in game so..."

@Izaya, use the GoF2Launcher.exe to set the res."
,IzayaOrihara,2012-08-22T08:59Z,"Ah, thanks. I missed that.

Also, I just tried cranking up some settings. Only thing I seen that could have helped was AF, but the space backgrounds just seem kind of low res in some places, especially distant planets (They look extremely low res).

Don't think it's drivers because I got the newest drivers available."
