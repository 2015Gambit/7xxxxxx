This looks terrible.  Please boycott."

,slosh1111,2012-08-21T10:43Z,Really appreciate this being put up... I am only downloading it to see if they have ruined it... You cannot top the UK version so this I think will be interesting. 
,aunker,2012-08-21T14:56Z,"The original version is one of my favorites. Having said that this one is ok, not good, it's ok. Aside from the fact that Jay, the best part of the original, is now a fat ugly ginger kid and that Neil seems like a burnout rather than just an idiot. I don't know I'm going to continue watching."
