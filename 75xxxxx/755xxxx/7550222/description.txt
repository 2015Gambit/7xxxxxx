Butch Cage and Willie B. Thomas - Old Time Black Southern String Band Music (Arhoolie) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Louisiana fiddle and guitar duo Butch Cage and Willie B. Thomas were recorded in 1959 by folklorist Harry Oster, who sought to capture a record of the fast-vanishing tradition of string bands who played dance and worship music for parties and church services. Primitive-sounding yet compelling, Cage and Thomas's versions of rarely heard ancient country blues songs like "I Had a Dream Last Night" and "It Ain't Gonna Rain No More" are a window into a bygone age, while their performance of "The Dirty Dozen" brings to light a song that, like the blues itself, has been constantly evolving for generations. ~Rovi (Allmusic)

ΓÇ£If you havenΓÇÖt heard this driving, raucous, almost free-form black country dance music, then I envy you for the treat you will experienceΓÇªItΓÇÖs not all blues; thereΓÇÖs gospel, ragtime, country dance tunes and popular song, but the blender that Cage and Thomas put these genres through gives them a unique flavor that belongs to the rural community they lived in and served as musicians.ΓÇ¥ ~Paul Vernon (Folk Roots)
