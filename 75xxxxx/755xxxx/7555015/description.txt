Description

WhoΓÇÖd a thought robbing the bank would be the easy part?

Now comes the real challenge ΓÇô to escape with your hard-earned loot having the
fuzz hot at your heels!

Weave in and out of oncoming traffic; dodge, outrun or ram pursuing police cars
and just generally crash, smash and thrash your way through 16 varied levels.

LetΓÇÖs face it: beating someone across the finishing line is a lot of fun,
but not nearly as much fun as tackling them into oncoming traffic to watch
chaos ensue

The Developers behind Reckless Racing now brings you Reckless Getaway!
