"Cambridge Hotel"

Award-winning chef and hospitality expert 
Gordon Ramsay checks into The Cambridge 
Hotel in Cambridge, NY. Established in 
1885, the hotel is the birthplace of pie a 
la mode, and home to a ghost, a little 
girl named Alice. But the Cambridge has 
seen better days. Its owners have no hotel 
experience and they are losing their 
investment in the landmark hotel. Ramsay 
confronts the owners to address the issues 
and works with them and their staff to 
turn the hotel around. Will his efforts be 
enough to save it...

20/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
