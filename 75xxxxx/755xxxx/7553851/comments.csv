,dtanfay,2012-08-21T13:49Z,"@manuep, it's not at ur end. Even i have noticed the problem with all yify rips since last month."
,MaltTiger,2012-08-21T15:12Z,"The Avengers' dialogue seems to be a bit quieter than it should be, it's this way with most of the copies."
,francesroxas,2012-08-21T15:34Z,"Hi, I really love your torrents! :) Can you rip the DVD features too? (like commentaries, gag reel, deleted scenes, etc?) please? if that is not too much to ask :) Thanks!"
,micron66,2012-08-21T18:11Z,"@alexcurt

stop spamming with links to that site,you are spamming that link unnecessarily in almost every movie torrent."
,rakich,2012-08-21T19:33Z,"Guys wat ever u comment, He never replies for anything. But ur torrents are simply awesome except the sound. Thanks once again."
,scp740521,2012-08-21T19:59Z,Thank you :)
,an7779,2012-08-21T23:50Z,"thanks to the uploader, I love all your work YIFY they are more than perfect, I have one question which might sound dumb, am still waiting for the 1080p release but can I download this one & watch it on my TV ? tho my TV doesn't support 3D ???"
,curly1015,2012-08-22T00:54Z,Wheres the 1080p????????
,madbytes1,2012-08-22T01:18Z,Audio makes this unwatchable.  Sounds like they're talking inside a fish bowl.  Deleted 5 minutes after download.
,dididie,2012-08-22T03:10Z,"Gaz is talking to Yify about the sound problems.  For some reason it got way below the normal encoding for sound.  The 720p responses were great on the sound quality compared to this so I'm sure in a day or two it'll be re-uploaded.  It sounds like it's a 32kbps mp3 or something.  Like REALLY lo fi/gargle sound.  Picture quality is great.  Never had a rip of his like that with the sound quality until this one.  Everyone makes mistakes, so stop busting his balls about it, he'll fix it."
,wiron,2012-08-22T04:48Z,A million Thanks!!!!
,blackbarsnope,2012-08-22T05:23Z,@yify   francesroxas is right.... we want d extras too
,vTempTationzzZ,2012-08-22T05:26Z,Thanks!
,Mendezgarcia,2012-08-22T07:56Z,"Hi yify. I'm looking for football casual film called ID.its by far the best film out there in regards to films like football factory ,green street etc.would appreciate if you are able to find and put up."
,f20cs13,2012-08-22T12:26Z,"Audio is whack. Sounds like a cam rip in alot of areas, and is very quiet. on 5.1 surround on 55"" LG"
,madbytes1,2012-08-22T23:44Z,The 1080p rip from publichd does not suffer the audio problems.  If you've got the space it's worth downloading.  Took about 4 hours.
,MistryWho,2012-08-23T22:39Z,"The audio isnt the only problem. The video isnt that great either on my 3DTV. The problem here is that if there is any imperfection with either side of the video, there is a huge distortion when they are overlayed. I tried just watching it in 2D(Just one side) and the quality is still pretty poor. 
I always DL YIFY's HD uploads, but his 3D aren't so great"
,kalabueh,2012-08-23T23:22Z,Hello. Anyone has a mac? I'm trying to start watching 3d films and been reading lots of things that are not helping. Any suggestions? 
,Mutegrill,2012-08-24T21:45Z,"Is GlowGaze an alias for YIFY?

http://thepiratebay.se/user/GlowGaze/

If not, GlowGaze upload all YIFY:s newest uploads, calling them his own. AND using them for marketing his own web site..."
,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-25T04:52Z,"why the hell is the video split in two??
i have a stereoscopic 3D LED LCD HDTV & couldnt watch this in 3D..
is this for the old school 3D style viewing or something?
seriously, WTF??
i have never seen a ""3D"" movie wit the screen split in two & dual images. 
the images dont even appear to be in sync with eachother..
total waste of 2GB's.. what a rip off.."
,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-25T05:01Z,can this be burnt to dvd to watch in 3D on a 3D LED LCD TV??
,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-25T05:31Z,"for anyone having trouble watching this in 3D on their 3D HDTV, like i was when playing on a laptop connected to my 3D HDTV via HDMI.. check your TV settings

■ 3D Mode: Select the 3D input format.
“Side by Side” and “Top & Bottom” are available
when the resolution is 720p, 1080i and 1080p in

DTV, HDMI
and USB mode or when set to PC

and the PC is connected through an HDMI/DVI

cable.


3D Auto View (Off / On)


: If 3D Auto View is set to On,

a “Side-by-Side” format HDMI signal with one of the

resolutions below is automatically switched to 3D. Here,
correct 3D information must be sent from the Standard
HDMI 3D Format."
,beboroch,2012-08-25T16:04Z,"hey team yify, many thanks for the work you guys have been doing, its very much appreciated. because of you guys i can actually the 3d aspect of my 3d tv and not just 1080p which is also great thanks to you guys. keep up the good work. i know not all the times the rips are going to be perfect but 99% of the times you guys get it right, so pay no attention to the negative comments."
,oboerne,2012-08-25T21:03Z,"very bad sound
video 10
audio 2"
,XuBhAn,2012-08-25T21:20Z,which 3D glasses are needed to watch this movie ?
,letitbe123,2012-08-27T16:51Z,great 3d but how do you get so small looks 1080p to me thank u fro share
,skanero,2012-08-28T18:41Z,"Movie: 10/10
Video: 8/10
Audio: 2/10

Please YIFY, if you are going to upload 3D movies try to use better quality"
,DemonFoxKira,2012-08-28T20:30Z,"I have to agree with others that the sound quality is quite horrible for a 1080p 3d movie. I wouldn't mind an extra 1GB if the sound quality was the same as the non 3D 1080p one, that is, a good 6 Channel Audio.
I have a question though. How do you get this mp4 video to play as 3d on a 3d HDTV. I mainly play movies through flash drive plugin the USB port of either the TV itself or my 3d Bluray (both Philips) but the outcome is similar to the screenshots, that is, two identical movies side by side playing. Tried going through the options but didn't see anything which would allow me to get the mp4 video file to play as 3D on my Full HD Screen. "
,DemonFoxKira,2012-08-29T17:45Z,"Forget about my previous comment. Got the 3d to work but do YIFY have any plan to re-do the audio because even though the 3d is great, the audio kinda ruins it. Like I said, I wouldn't mind the the file going up to around 3.5 GB if it means the audio is of great quality."
,hoftos,2012-09-03T23:57Z,"Video - 10
Audio - 5

Great small download, but audio is a bit bad :

Thanks YIFY!"
