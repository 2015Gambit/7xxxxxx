A best-of compilation from the CGW Radio/GFW Radio/Out of the Game podcasts. These clips range from from the show's earliest, 2006 episodes to the most recent audio from the (now-defunct) Out of the Game podcast (2010). Inside you'll find over 25 hours of classic Brodeo, including complete collections of the infamous Heroes of the Web series and their original music (including Jeff Green's "phat" raps and Shawn Elliott's parody pieces). This is a must-download for every fan of the classic podcast (hardcore and casual followers alike). So, please, do yourself a favor and download and enjoy.
