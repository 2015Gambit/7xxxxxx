,anarchist9027,2012-08-22T06:46Z,Does this Include any updates or is this straight RTM?
,coolster505,2012-08-23T17:38Z,"@anarchist9027 It has SP1, and comes with IE8, but you can download IE9, and get all updates, because the product key I included is genuine and will say activated on the ICT screen and in Computer properties. You have to enter I think after installation. Write down the product key before installing!"
,anarchist9027,2012-08-23T18:24Z,"I downloaded it and it is straight RTM, thats okay tho. If you are looking for activation, I would suggest Daz's Windows Loader:http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information"
,coolster505,2012-08-24T18:32Z,"OK then it might be straight RTM, but still reliable. The product key I copied off a file server of my school district and then uploaded it to Google Docs and I downloaded image of server from M$. I also recommend free training videos here at http://www.freeittraning.com for training that is actually free and for torrent of some Trainsignal vids that would normally cost hundreds of $, here is the torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5150400/Trainsignal_Windows_Server_2008_R2

Thanks for downloading and please SEED and tell other users about it!"
