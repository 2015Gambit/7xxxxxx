First of all I would like to thank you for such a great uploads like pes 2013 demo and pes 2013 patches with unlocked teams. It is amazing. 
Now... I have some problem with those stadiums and I guess it is about my computer, its some dual core and 3 gb of ram, 9800gt nvidia ... pes goes like hell on it but everytime when I extract or replace img with those stadiums of 1st and 2nd upload, nothing happens and there are still one stadium. Please help me if you can



Best regards,
Axelsson"
