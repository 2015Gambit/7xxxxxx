The Starlost was a Canadian SciFi series and broadcast in 1973 on CTV in Canada and syndicated to local stations in the United States.

Faced with destruction, Earth builds a multi-generational starship "8,000 miles (11,000 km) in character." The ship contains dozens of isolated, self-contained biospheres, each kilometers across and housing people of different cultures. Early in the voyage, however, disaster struck, and the command section was destroyed along with its crew.

Centuries later, a young man, Devon (Keir Dullea), a resident of a biosphere with an Amish-like culture, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. He inadvertently finds his way into the service areas of the ship and uncovers its fate: the bridge has been destroyed, the crew killed and the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun. Devon and his fellow escapees Rachel (Gay Rowan) and Garth (Robin Ward) must find the backup bridge if they are to save the Ark and the colonists aboard. Occasionally, they are aided by the Ark's computer systems portrayed by William Osler.

These were ripped from the DVD (not lo-def VHS or 3rd generation TV tape ) and compiled with HandBrake. I'm not a pro at this but I thought that others would enjoy something watchable. Enjoy.
