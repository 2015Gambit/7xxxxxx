[V],psspss,2012-09-12T07:44Z,"sorry im not doing xvids for this series anymore
cutting back a bit...

i was hoping afg would do them but looks like
you have ot stick with MP4 when and if they come out..

its easy to grab their stream though and make a mp4 or xvid.. someone else could easily do it
and upload.. will need a proxy in usa as well.. or vpn"
