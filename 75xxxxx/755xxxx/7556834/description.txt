Part 9 : Realm of the Great White Bear 

Discover the fate of a polar bear and her twin cubs at the icy top of the world. National Geographic cameras follow the family during a two-year Arctic odyssey filled with touching and unforgettable moments, many never before filmed. Watch in wonder as curious cubs emerge from their den for the first time after a three-month hibernation. Go 'ice-crashing' with the polar bear family as they hunt for seals. Feel the tension as the mother protects her cubs from a hostile male, one of many dangers lurking on the ice floes. Just half of all cubs survive beyond their first year, and this polar bear family needs the mother's finely tuned instincts - and luck - to beat the odds.
