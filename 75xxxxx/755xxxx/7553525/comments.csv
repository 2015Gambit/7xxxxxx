,funkoligy,2012-09-02T18:24Z,"Hi Ipmark just getting back to your question now. for example if i join Garmin 
Ita-Swi-Aus NT 2013.20-AdriaRoute 4.00 Unlocked IMG.part1.rar
Garmin Ita-Swi-Aus NT 2013.20-AdriaRoute 4.00 Unlocked IMG.part2.rar
Garmin Ita-Swi-Aus NT 2013.20-AdriaRoute 4.00 Unlocked IMG.part3.rar

In Gmap tool it reads errors or faults at end of joining process. Can these parts be joined to make one image map?

Thanks"
,Ipmark,2012-09-03T02:10Z,"Be more specific.

I joined with GmapTool:
Ita-Swi-Aus NT 2013.20-AdriaRoute 4.00 Unlocked IMG
Garmin France NT 2013.20 Unlocked IMG
Garmin Esp-Por NT 2013.20 Unlocked IMG
in one file.

No errors."

,Ipmark,2012-09-05T10:45Z,"The map Garmin Ita-Swi-Aus NT 2013.20-AdriaRoute 4.00 Unlocked IMG must to be decompressed with Winrar.

The map has four regions already joined together (Ita+Swi+Aus+AR)."
