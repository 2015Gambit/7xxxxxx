if so, can u upload their new original movies"
[T],iamgreat,2012-08-25T15:50Z,"Cindy, there is never was a Hallmark Channel in Canada and many of their so-called original movies actually aren't originals of Hallmark but simply acquisitions. If you want something it does help to be specific so that a certain response can be given rather than leave me guessing what you are asking about.

Feel free to comment on this episode of Copper too."
