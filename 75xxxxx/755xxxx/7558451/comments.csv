,bloominoctober,2012-09-06T19:21Z,I've got Fables 79 and 80.  I'll try to upload the torrent when I get home from work.
,bloominoctober,2012-09-06T19:23Z,"Also, Fables 120 is the latest.  Issue 121 will be releases on Sept 19."
,bloominoctober,2012-09-07T15:09Z,"@therandomkind ... don't know if you've already found them or not, but here are issues 79 and 80.  The torrent only has 2 seeders (as of this writing), but hopefully, more people will help out ...
