,xchungfoo,2012-08-28T00:34Z,thanks for the awesome movie works well but i cant get the settings right on the sbs ghosting seems more than should be also whenever i play it through powerdvd it looks outrageously good but only when it uses powerdvds built in 3d mode but it will only play a second than it reverts back to normal either way is there a better player with built in 3d for this type of file or will i have to watch the ghosty job my tv is doing on its own....any input would be appreciated and thanks again for the awesome upload
