,biggz786,2012-08-22T02:47Z,"I think they are all corrupted

can anyone confirm?"
,RumInMyHand,2012-08-22T05:04Z,"Setup is work fine, no some error."
,hotrodguy,2012-08-22T07:17Z,"Confirmed. All parts of setup are corrupt.

Don't waste your time downloading this one..."
,RumInMyHand,2012-08-22T13:42Z,"Have some trouble - upgrade your drivers, visual c++, direkt X and video drivers.."
,hotrodguy,2012-08-22T16:03Z,Video drivers wont have any effect on an installer reading setup files as corrupt. Nor will an out of date version of DirectX.
