,Bynx,2012-08-23T04:26Z,I wonder why this has never been released.

,kluelos,2012-08-23T07:32Z,"That's because Disney thinks that some of the content is politically incorrect and racist. Right or wrong, they'd still get sued for it."
,ww12345,2012-08-23T07:45Z,"No, it's not banned by anyone - every year it comes up for review at the Disney board meeting. The problem they see with it is the relationship between Uncle Remus and Johnny, and the fact that the movie glosses over the Reconstruction era and Disney-fies the problems of that time period. However, it is not now, nor has it ever, been banned by anyone, including the Disney corporation. In fact, it was widely released on PAL VHS and Laserdisc in the early '90s. However, those releases suffered from the same problems which troubled this release - bad 3:2 pulldown and various other technical problems.

If I can say this modestly, this is the best release out there - period. Until Disney releases their version, this will be the cleanest copy out there. Enjoy! :)"

,ww12345,2012-08-23T18:04Z,"Yes, this is much, much better. Like I said in my previous comment, this, in my humble opinion, is the best copy available. :)"
