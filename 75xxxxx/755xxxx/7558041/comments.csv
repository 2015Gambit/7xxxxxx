I am a very thorough and meticulous searcher of the internet and keen on finding these very little known but significant bits of important evidence. I am glad some appreciate my efforts."

True, but you forget that he was a journalist in Germany between 1934 and 1941, so he had first hand info on many things, besides being a very entertaining and reliable writer who covered practically all sides of the equation. That's why it is still today a bestseller.
