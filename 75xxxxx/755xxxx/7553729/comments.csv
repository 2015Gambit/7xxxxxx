,famemon78,2012-08-21T13:13Z,couple of quick questions Petey .. r these retail DVD-R's or dvdrips? 2.76 gigs looks awfully small for dvd 5 size.. secondly why does it say Multisubs if Dutch subs r the only ones listed as showing ?! no eng subs ? :(
[V],Petey85,2012-08-21T14:07Z,"please read the info, where all questions will be answered :) but I will point out some again...

It's real retail, but... because of biterate/filesize I had to split 1 DVD in 2 DVD's

so normally there are 5 episodes on 1 DVD, I had had to split it in 3 + 2

now as you can see I have to work with proxy due to legal sh!t here in Holland, and at this site I can only choose one texted language, so I choosed Dutch, cuz that's where I come from, but as u can see in the info:
ENG, DK, NL, FI, FR, NO, SP, SE SUBS!!
and
ENG, FR, SP AUDIO!!

hope your questions have been answered :)
so:
retail? YES!
multisubs? YES!
dvd5? YES (but splitted) :)"
,famemon78,2012-08-22T10:56Z,lol my bad :) Incredible upload  ! thanks a bunch for this .. been looking all over for DVD-R formats of big tv shows .. surprisingly hard to find! especially the new seasons
[V],Petey85,2012-08-22T16:57Z,"well, i'm not surprised...

The WEB-DL's of big TV-shows do have better quality i.m.o. then DVDR.."
