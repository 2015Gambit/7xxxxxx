Its that they do not want people to steal there info and use it; mainstreme media style.

Its easy to make a 3D magazine into a PDF.
You just ""Print"" it to a pdf maker of your choice.

Also, the .exe file they allow you to download is completely safe.
You can also print the magazine from the website, which is the same .exe that is running the 3D software so you can view it!

Spread the word!
You beat me to uploading the pdf torrent!! :-)"
