Tommy McCook & The Supersonics~Pleasure Dub (Pressure Sounds) [FLAC] {MKOP}

CanΓÇÖt take any more tuneless heavy dub? Then Pressure Sounds have the cure.

Pleasure Dub, as the title suggests, is a series of highly creative versions to elegant and feel-good Duke Reid produced rocksteady and early reggae A sides. These dubs were remixed in the mid 70s, after ReidΓÇÖs death, by his nephew Errol Brown, who became head engineer at Treasure Isle once JamaicaΓÇÖs first major female producer, Sonia Pottinger took charge. Prior to this release, the original Pleasure Dub has never been issued on cd. The music itself was laid down by ex Skatalite saxophonist Tommy McCook and a changeable collective of players called The Supersonics. Old time tunes getting the echo treatment include Phylis DillonΓÇÖs Right Track, The ParagonsΓÇÖ The Tide Is High, and DillonΓÇÖs chunky underrated cut to Marlena ShawΓÇÖs Woman Of The Ghetto. Additionally, Pressure Sounds have attached some bonus versions. These include two different mixes to John HoltΓÇÖs ever popular hallucinatory tale Ali Baba, and a jolly organ workout atop Alton EllisΓÇÖ sprightly but hard hearted brush off Girl IΓÇÖve Got A Date.Brown tended to favour reverb and delay over simply fading or muting the various elements. The result is an instrumentally busier, less subtle sound than that of the dubs created at Coxsone DoddΓÇÖs rival label Studio 1 (some listeners may find the incessant crashing snares a little OTT). McCook was a hornsman first and foremost, but his occasional flute playing is as distinctive an ingredient as BrownΓÇÖs re-interpretive effects.

All in all, this is a good way into dub for people who donΓÇÖt like it and a rare and vital link with its roots for those who do. A pleasure from start to finish.~Angus Taylor (reggaenews)
