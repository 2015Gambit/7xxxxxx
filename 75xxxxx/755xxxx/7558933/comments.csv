,xhizors,2012-08-24T11:42Z,"The video, although it seems slightly clearer than other releases (although not noticeably) is still plagued by high contrast and bad levels. The audio is very tinny, with nothing but treble (there is zero bass). I'm going to conclude that people keep uploading the same garbage source, but with different garbage contrast adjustments, and a new silly name at the end of the release... If only there weren't 100 uploads of the exact same source on here... yay, another one."
