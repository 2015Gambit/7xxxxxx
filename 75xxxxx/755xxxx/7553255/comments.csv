[T],trialNerror,2012-08-21T13:13Z,"lol i swear every torrent i look up that guy above me has most often left more than 1 comment with his own two cents. 

so, was scene suppose to name it ""survivorman 10 days s01e01""? i don't think so, tim.

from what i can tell scene goes by the majority rules rule. i see a couple sites saying these are 'specials' but i see a few more referring to it as season 4.  don't like it? rename it and just be thankful there are versions of it available to watch.

whiny s.o.b's all over p2p. damn. ungrateful. needy. greedy. impatient. seemingly never satisfied. shit. no wonder scene doesn't give a damn about p2p. i'm not scene, but i can understand their point of view!"

,trentonresident,2012-08-21T15:39Z,"So is this the same pre-release version with ""commercial goes here"" etc?"
,Mimsy,2012-08-21T22:45Z,"Is this an actual capped version and not the pre-release version of the episode which has been up for months? 
The quality seems good, so I'm assuming the prior. In that case, well done and keep them coming! Thank you."
,talica,2012-08-21T23:32Z,Thank you
[V],psspss,2012-08-22T00:35Z,"it will be capped version

but how can it be better then a pre-release version? a few seconds of labels shouldnt worry anyone

better then having big defacing TV LOGOs surely

theres a 720p of this episode no one has
bothered adding "
[V],psspss,2012-08-22T00:41Z,"the one been out for months is non xvid as well
however I converted them.. but didnt know about the comm labels else i could of edited them out but they are so minor"
[V],psspss,2012-08-22T00:44Z,"scene and tne are wrong..

if you lookup the canada tv channel they list all 3 seasons and this as 10 days OCLN or something

it confused me at first but I did a intense check
to make sure if wasnt a new series or wrongly labels 10 days series or more episodes etc

the reason I post is to inform people as well tne
or answer questions thats why demon community was the best and not as hostile"
