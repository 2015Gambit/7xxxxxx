,SectorVector,2012-08-22T18:14Z,Could you please compress and upload larger files (say > 50 MB). 7zip seems to be the preferred choice. Thank you.
[T],Spetses,2012-08-23T19:49Z,SectorVector - I am at a complete loss as to what you are on about.  7zip ? is that a soft drink. Many thanks spetses.
,SectorVector,2012-08-24T09:20Z,":) OK. Looks like you are new to this. Let me try to explain.
I meant the free compression software called 7-zip. http://www.7-zip.org/
I hope you have used a tool like Winzip or Winrar which _compresses_ 1 or more files thereby reducing the nett file size. Smaller file size means i can download it faster. :) Hence the request.

Steps:
1) Go to the website above.
2) Download and install it on your PC (windows or linux)
3) Use the installed software to create a compressed file for each of your uploads.
4) Upload the compressed/smaller sized .7z file instead of the original PDF. 
I know its not the best of explanations. Let me know ..."
[T],Spetses,2012-08-25T18:30Z,"SV   I am fully aware about Zip files,I was making a lighthearted joke. As to your request I am still at a loss as for your request.As its the only one I have had on this subject I will continue to upload my files in PDF format and keep the other 99.9% happy. Best regards Spetses."
