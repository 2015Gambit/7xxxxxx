eTextbook of "Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics, 2nd Edition" by C. A. Balanis (c2012). Small bookmarked and page-numbered PDF file (7 MB) complete with table of contents, appendices and index. Quasi-native PDF quality.

Overview and table of contents: Google the string "WILEY balanis productCd-EHEP002059" (w/o quotes)

AUDIENCE: (Excerpted from the author's preface)

"The discussion presumes that the student has general knowledge of vector analysis, differential and integral calculus, and electromagnetics either from at least an introductory undergraduate electrical engineering or physics course. Mathematical techniques required for understanding some advanced topics, mostly in the later chapters, are incorporated in the individual chapters or are included as appendixes.

The book can be used for at least a two-semester sequence in Electromagnetics, beyond an introduction to basic undergraduate EM. Although the first part of the book in intended for senior undergraduates and beginning graduates in electrical engineering and physics, the later chapters are targeted for advanced graduate students and practicing engineers and scientists."
