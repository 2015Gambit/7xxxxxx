,Neraforesta,2012-08-22T07:29Z,"I aint gonna h8 on hiest, cause i like the name, Buuuuuuut.. this is the same cropped out shit as the others. A8 V5 for a cam. Blurry at parts, flickers, and Half their fucking heads are cut off the entire friggin movie. And when the jaggoff recording this actually tries to adjust the pic, it falls right back down to cut their heads off again. Same prob as The Watch. Listen, I appreciate people doin what they're doin, but for fuck sake, please just pan out to get the entire screen, or sit farther back in the theater. You can always crop and clean up later, but mutherfucker if you aint making a bunch of really honest people pissed.  /vent off.  p.s. I didn't mean the shit about being honest, I steal shit every day."
