This is the magic that earned Daryl the title of "The World Champion Magician's Magician" and he will captivate you with these mysteries. Oh, and did we mention that you should be ready to laugh and laugh? Each volume contains an incredible variety of close-up, cabaret and impromptu magic, with many easy-to-do and self-working effects. In addition to the popular impromptu quick tricks, Daryl also teaches many full routines, complete with snappy patter and professional presentations. And, as if all of this weren't enough, each volume also begins with approximately 30 minutes of Daryl performing these Fooler Doolers as a hugely entertaining show which could be shared with non-magician friends and family.

Also, see Daryl turn the rarely seen ΓÇ£Mystery of the Traveling MarblesΓÇ¥ into an impromptu masterpiece - and teach you step by step to do the same!
