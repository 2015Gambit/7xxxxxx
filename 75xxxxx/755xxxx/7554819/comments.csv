,phenrik,2012-08-21T22:15Z,"Doesnt seem to work here either. Only the skidrow thingy comes, the old school crack info with atari sound. :P Am i doing something wrong?"
,phenrik,2012-08-21T22:37Z,"Some say that u press esc on the scrolling text info, and then a main screen comes, well its not happening on my screen. It just exits.. So have to wait for a different crack i believe"
,khallian,2012-08-21T22:51Z,"this doesn't work at all, you're all trolled. even its not Skidrow release wait for the original one. you dont need to update drivers or any bullshit just DONT WASTE TIME HERE."
,safdt8009,2012-08-21T23:47Z,steam must beinstalled & u need to login too in order to play 
,star*,2012-08-22T02:06Z,"Thanks for the upload.
It works good. Since it's a Steam game you need to have Steam installed, but you don't need to be logged in to Steam to play."

,my_dixie_normous,2012-08-22T06:44Z,Forget it Guyz.....someone is trolling us all. The crack is Bogus! It does not work through with or without steam and nothing I have tried will make it the crack run the game. You really need to test uploads yourselves before you upload 'scene4all' coz your rep just got worse here. -1
,CrazySpartan,2012-08-22T09:03Z,"It worked till the start screen (where you can select options, challenges etc) but once i started the game there was a black screen and nothing happened after that."
,Relaq,2012-08-22T09:49Z,Its a 8Bit Fake. Haha what a choke.:(
,star*,2012-08-22T11:21Z,"As I wrote, this crack works perfectly(*) with Steam installed.
(*) First time I ran it I got the famous black screen after starting the game. It seems Square Enix has released a version that is a real RAM bitch =
I fixed it by doing three things...
1. Since I'm on a laptop from end of 2009 I first rebooted my laptop so a minimum of other processes were running before starting the game.
2. I the Graphic options I selected the ""Low"" profile.
3. When the game starts you will be presented with screens promoting companies involved, after the first screen showing multiple little logos you will see the screen showing ""Glacier"", with the white cube thingy. As soon you are see that screen press Esc. to go directly to the Main Game selection screen.
As many people have reported, the current game version is VERY prone to lag, hopefully Square Enix will fix this since it's impossible to play sniper when your sight lags all over the screen."
,Relaq,2012-08-22T17:05Z,@star* Why do you read this? This Crack is a Fake!
,Zipgun,2012-08-22T20:20Z,"@Relaq

Dude learn English please. ""its a choke"" and "" why you read this?"" 

LOL! ""Its JOKE"" and ""Why did you WRITE this"" 

And did you tards install STEAM?! 

Fuck Glad I buy most of the games I like. Got this shit for free as I pre-ordered it. Its short but sweet. And I never use NOOB PUBLIC trackers like this one. Too much dumbass kids, leechers and whiners ""seed seed seed!"" 

I only use PRIVATE trackers. I just come here to laugh at all you silly noob fucks."
,star*,2012-08-22T20:25Z,"@Relaq
There's nothing wrong with this crack. If you can't get it to run with the above instructions you are either; 
1. using a faulty game installation
2. a crappy machine
3. simply a troll"
,MousE0910,2012-08-22T22:07Z,"OK, people. I finally managed to figure it all out. Point people on this comment, if they need help.

To get it working, you need to have Steam installed on your computer. You don't need to be logged in. However, here's the catch:
Steam MUST be installed in it's default folder (Program Files). If you install Steam in any different folder, the game will not launch at all.

Second thing - the scroll lock thing. If you have Scroll lock ON BEFORE you run the game, it will skip the Skidrow intro and show a message box that the intro has been skipped and to press OK to play the game. This works with the Spider-Man release as well. Pressing Scroll Lock AFTER the game was launched has no effect.

Now stop insulting each other and go play the game!"
,sdchargerfan4life,2012-08-23T06:21Z,Mouss you know what to do...i push start sniper challenge and it crashes
,sdchargerfan4life,2012-08-23T06:27Z,Mous i launch the game just fine and but i press play game it crashes
,MousE0910,2012-08-23T09:55Z,"If the game crashes for you after you press play, you're out of luck. The game is poorly optimalized and WILL crash on many computers. If it doesn't crash, it lags A LOT. The only current way to get around this is to upgrade your computer."
,Scrapith,2012-08-23T10:26Z,"Ok guys, finally got this game working myself... I will say exactly how..  btw i already had steam installed to c:gamessteam on win7 64 bit.

this guide assumes you have steam installed in any other location other than the default.

1# install hitman sniper challenge
2# copy crack files
3# delete all files in your steam folder except the steamapps folder (to backup all your games) and Steam.exe
4# copy steam folder (contents should be steamapps folder and steam.exe) to c:programfiles (x86)
5# run steam, it will redownload needed files and update itself. login
6# add hmsc.exe to steam as a non-steam game.
7# play.

keep your antivirus and firewalls turned on, block hmsc.exe access with firewall

if your on 32bit, then use c:programfilessteam
if your on 64bit, then use c:programfiles (x86)steam

Confirming this does work, problem seems to be a filepath for something is hardcoded."
,Scrapith,2012-08-23T10:41Z,"update to my previous comment.

you don't event need to add hmsc.exe as a non-steam game, or have steam running while you play. just tested."
,g4byte,2012-08-23T15:15Z,"it won't run if u don't disable windows defender in services, alsou make exclusion in av, in win 8 there is some stupid unblock comand in file propertis, so it's hard to get it run but it works :)"
,djthanos7,2012-08-25T19:43Z,fuck all the cracks didnt work from me
