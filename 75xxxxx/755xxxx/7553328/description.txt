ΓÇ£Lucid, deeply informed, and enlivened with striking illustrations, this penetrating study could be entitled ΓÇÿEconomics in the Real World.ΓÇÖ Chang reveals the yawning gap between standard doctrines concerning economic development and what really has taken place from the origins of the industrial revolution until today. His incisive analysis shows how, and why, prescriptions based on reigning doctrines have caused severe harm, particularly to the most vulnerable and defenseless, and are likely to continue to do so.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöNoam Chomsky

Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the ΓÇ£World I s FlatΓÇ¥ orthodoxy of T homas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, todayΓÇÖs economic superpowersΓÇöfrom the U .S. to Britain to his native KoreaΓÇöall attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade andΓÇövia our proxies such as the World Bank, I nternational Monetary Fund, and World T rade OrganizationΓÇöramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.
