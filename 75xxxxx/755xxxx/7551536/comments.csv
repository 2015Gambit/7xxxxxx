,Rush,2012-08-20T21:02Z,Ratings: 5.2/10 from 47 users   
,ReitenX,2012-08-21T06:07Z,"5.2 isn't horrible.  And I enjoy a good martial arts film so it was pretty good for me.  To each their own.
Anyways, thanks for uploading, not the best film, but it wasn't bad either.

V: 9
A:9
M:6"
,ironymon,2012-08-21T08:21Z,"Subs can be non existent, then it would be even more interesting trying to find out what they are saying by watching body language, let's face it, we came here to see some decapitations, or gut spills or at the very least, two guys charge towards each other, and only one lives LOL."
,simon200,2012-08-21T12:08Z,"Spoken language is NOT english
description needs to be  changed"
,village1diot,2012-08-21T13:30Z,"come on people. There are two audio channels. One is Chinese, the other is English. If you have a good player you will be able to choose the one you want.

Good luck(You will probably need it)"

,vampzcore,2012-08-21T16:56Z,thanks!!
,kungfum,2012-08-21T17:13Z,"Pretty good video quality, but the worst englisg subs ever.
Why write the action in subs when someone giggles, laughs or footsteps when these are universally recognized?
Just focus on language versus effects.
The subs only include about 1/50th of what's being said.
Thanks anyway for the effort. Better subs will show up sooner or later."

,noel_lee,2012-08-22T18:08Z,"why did i ever watch this??

,arlokan,2012-08-22T19:03Z,"Can anybody tell me if this is the kind of chinese movie where the people flight from tree to tree, or is this a more realistic one?"

,a002074t,2012-08-24T01:16Z,"This is the STUPIDEST movie I've seen in the last 20 yrs.  After the 1st hr, I had to fast fwd and I'm so glad I did :-)  Aside from the crappy subtitles and 2nd audio track (which I found way too late), half the movie is about a stick from behind a curtain hitting idiots who walk up to it like mosquitoes to a zapper.  NEVER AGAIN!!!"
,luisbaeta,2012-08-26T16:09Z,The trailer looked pretty cool but the movie not worth it AV 9/9 thanks anyway
