,micriches,2012-08-27T12:35Z,"malekisaman  dnt mount the Iso File, just open it with POWER Iso. and the run the setup.exe file then make sure to choose 'Extract to temporary Folder"" option.  

I suggest You use Power iso 5.4 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7548175/Power_ISO_5.4___Serial_Keys_Working_(PowerISO) 

That is what i used and it works Flawlessly."

It does work. Scans clean under Norton 2012 and Norton 2013. I had no troubles getting it to run. Mounted ISO as usual in PowerISO (though any ISO program should work). For me, the autorun features did work. Worked fine after burning to CD too."
,Adriesk,2012-09-15T18:39Z,"Worked flawlessly! At first i tried extracting the iso with winRAR which resulted in an error. I tried mounting with imaging software but nothing. Then i decided to open it with Power ISO and extract it. So if any of you have problems extracting this iso, simply downlaod power iso which is a free trial and you can extract the file (even from right click context menu). Thanks alot micriches. The program works flawelessly. Hats off to you :)"
