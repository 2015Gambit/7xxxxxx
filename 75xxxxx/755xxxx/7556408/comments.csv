Download and wait for crack.

Uploaders Note:
I had to rar this release as there were so many files and torrent file was becoming so big."
,MNH99,2012-08-22T16:49Z,"Thanks tikasukaz, I assume this is the one provided by SKIDROW?"
,MNH99,2012-08-22T16:51Z,"Nvmd, I seen the reference URLs in the dir.  

Cheers"

,fflaw,2012-08-24T00:29Z,"So the crack is out, but...how do I do this? I can't find an ISO or anything to mount."
,Metalnat111,2012-08-24T03:16Z,"The Crack isn't compatible to your release,  tikasukaz.  It didn't work for me, at least. So i am now downloading the Skidrow version in a hope for a better outcome. 

Thanks for your efforts nonetheless. It's highly appreciated. "
,Aerionix,2012-08-24T04:22Z,same.  i get to the main menu and completely locks up.  hopefully finished getting the Skidrow version tonight with better luck.  Good luck all
,mags1987,2012-08-24T05:44Z,How do I install? I cant find the install file. Which files do I put on an .ISO?
,jk7899,2012-08-24T16:19Z,Guys i think you just press extract here with the parts and then extract the part that says missing to the same folder then add the crack to the folder and drag the folder to program files X86
,G1247,2012-08-24T23:10Z,jk7899 did that method you just suggested work for you ?
,David89an,2012-08-25T22:22Z,"i extract the files and the crack into the other files, and after installing direct x, it says ""MSVCP100.dll is missing"", what is this?"
,hulkman185,2012-08-26T12:02Z,"Hi i was wondering, if this steam unlocked version means that i will be able to play with multiplayer and escalation?. in the game. "
,David89an,2012-08-26T12:35Z,"I fixed the ""MSVCP100.dll is missing"" issue by installing ""microsoft visual c++"" and uppdating windows with important and optional uppdates. Im at chapter 4 now.

When i try entering multiplayer/escalation it tells me the key is invalid."

,hulkman185,2012-08-26T19:52Z,"David89an , that is what it is telling me also, invalid keycode.  So what do they mean by steam unlocked?. anyone willing to help would be greatly appreciated. "
,Phase30,2012-09-14T15:49Z,Same thing here..invalid keycode..would be great if multiplayer works..this game is the bizz-nizz..
