This album played a big part in getting me into this fandom.  If you like it, please support the artist.
The album can be bought for any price at http://notacleverpony.bandcamp.com/ and about 85% of the proceeds go to her.
She has mostly abandoned her old username of NotACleverPony, and occasionally posts music under, though it seems her current circumstances don't allow her much time to compose very much.
I may post more info in the comments, or perhaps in this description if that's even possible.
