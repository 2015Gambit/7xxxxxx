Here is our new lighter remastered version of "the big blue" or "Le grand bleu"
extended version.(version longue)
There is an included US sub now for more convenience for all as "forced"
Btw,we have downgraded original French DTS-HD MA 5.1 to a new AC3-5.1 512 kbps speed to get a gain on final size as well as now we provide you this new one as HD.720p only so.
Quality is still very good and Final size fits to 10 GB extra size anyway.
A true BD9 or DVD 8,5 GB version will also come in september end... 
We hope you will enjoy it and hope give more luck to all average/medium/slow peers to grab it as well.
A third lighter version will come in E-AC3 in few weeks anyway and will fit to DVD 4,5 GB or BD5 size.
Sill delivered as BDrip mkv H.264 anyway :)
See more details about this BDrip after this post on TPB cause text's size is still very limited here :/
...
Seed please and we wish you have a good film anyway of course :)
don't forget to give up speed enough,please or you may get slow download
for sure.
Don't forget now that all is decentralised so all torrent files are no longer more stocked on most web site of designed trackers working for.
This makes a huge difference now and that's why you have a big interest to work in cooperative mode by giving a suffisant up speed,thereby i mean that all peers must absolutely share enough for permitting an efficient true seed so.
Ty for your understanding
...
best regards
