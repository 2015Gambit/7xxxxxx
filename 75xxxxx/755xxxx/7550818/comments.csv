,Silencer7,2012-08-24T17:23Z,"Best copy out yet, bar none. TY."
,Silencer7,2012-08-24T18:33Z,"@K1ller187:  Ty.

A 8.5 - V 7.5, kinda almost VHS quality."
,michaelrwatson,2012-08-25T05:15Z,"3.73 GB? Almost FOUR GIGAbytes?! That's the size of a raw DVD.

Did you morons (that'd be you MatiNE) ever hear of compression..?"
,DxDan,2012-08-25T11:24Z,Is there a reason why this copy is almost 4GB ?
,Silencer7,2012-08-26T02:20Z,"@ last two...

In the computer-world, compression causes something called QUALITY LOSS.  Lot of f'ing whiners."
,Zombie442,2012-08-26T20:54Z,If you all have a problem with the quality then perhaps you all should buy a ticket and watch it in the theater or wait until it comes out on BluRay. 
,DxDan,2012-09-05T11:28Z,"@ silencer7 , shove your stupid remarks up your ass , most of the decent uploaders compress their movies before uploading them you idiot , that is how they became famous of uploading their movies , not to mention that their copies are in HD not like this crap , what an idiot with a dumb attitude ."
,DxDan,2012-09-05T11:30Z,"@Zombie442 , I have already seen it at the theater but i want to see it again on my screen , that is why i'm looking for a decent copy ."
,Silencer7,2012-09-12T02:47Z,"@ DxDan,  Fuck you, idiot."
,onesixth,2012-09-13T16:14Z,Cox shut off my internet temporarily because I downloaded this file. I had to call them up to reinstate my connection. They told me a lot of stuff and they said that they would give my name to the feds and I would go on a list. Also if it happens again their would be an investigation? After I deleted the file they turned my connection back on. :(
