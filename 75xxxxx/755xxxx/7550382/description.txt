Two high school misfits, one a transfer student who lives to compete on the swim team, the other a sensitive, nerdy sketch artist find themselves attracted, but accepting of one another's faults.  What begins as a stand-offish friendship grows into a deep love and appreciation for the companionship both have longed for.  The beginning of "Watercolors" is also its conclusion, however the film is certain to tug at one's heartstrings.  Definitely a three-hanky movie!
