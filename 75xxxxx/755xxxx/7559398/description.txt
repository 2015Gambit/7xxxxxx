Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, August 22 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the latest police state actions by the TSA, including government goons going through bags and subjecting Republicans to additional measures at a Paul Ryan event and a man kicked off a flight for the crime of wearing a t-shirt critical of the grope and grab agency. 

Alex also talks with Linda Litowsky in-studio. Ms. Litowsky is the Executive Director of Channel Austin. Alex covers the latest news, including the case of a Marine who was forcibly transferred to a psychiatric facility after he posted anti-establishment messages on Facebook which questioned the official story behind 9/11 and referred to corruption within the government. The FBI claims Brandon RaubΓÇÖs posts were "terrorist in nature." 

Alex talks about the economy and the startling fact that more than half of all Americans are on some form of government assistance.
