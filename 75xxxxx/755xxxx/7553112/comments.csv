,typedslowly,2012-08-22T01:04Z,"Is it just me, or is there something wrong with this file? I had the same issue before with another of your HK eps"
[V],psspss,2012-08-22T02:05Z,"no problems.. ripped like I normally do

watched it.. and all in sync

people having problem should always check it in VLC if it comes up with a error like indexing then
the file you got is damaged

as vlc will play pretty much anything
even partial video fileds as long as its
got a header


most of the problems happen where the PC
has a fat32 error NTFS has less problems but still doing a scandisk may fix the problem
then right click on file in utorrent and go force recheck (other clients prob dont have these nice features :))

the other reasons is antip2p get on and share bad chunks slowing it down and sometimes bugs in clients allow it to be saved in the file making the file less playable

use peer block 1.1. is best even witha VPN "
[V],psspss,2012-08-22T02:08Z,"it has 115 seeders and that means prob 1000 download it at least and one complaining means
its sure end.. 

what client you using? I use Utorrent 2.2.1

it was the best one"
,goodvibrations,2012-08-25T07:07Z,"@typedslowly, I noticed for the last few episodes my DVD player will only play the first 5 seconds or so of it.  All the ones in the past worked fine from the same uploader.  Not exactly sure why the most recent ones aren't working.

Either way, I certainly do appreciate the upload."
