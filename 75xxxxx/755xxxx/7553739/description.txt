Zydeco Volume 1: The Early Years (1961-1962) (Arhoolie) [320KB] {MKOP}

Historic live recordings of Zydeco music as it evolved in Texas and southwest Louisiana from the rural French Creole tradition of Acadiana. A totally unique, vibrant, emotional, rhythmic dance music played with  accordions and sung mostly in Creole French patois, but with blues, cajun and early rock & roll influences. The recordings (except last three) were made at taverns and house dances in Houston, Tx. and southwest Louisiana in 1961 & 1962 by Chris Strachwitz. As a nice bonus, both sides of Clifton Chenier's 1954 debut single are included (they're far more R&B-influenced than the field recordings here), and there's a 1949 jump blues-zydeco hybrid by Clarence Garlow, "Bon Ton Roulet."
