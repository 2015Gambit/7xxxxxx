http://nimga.com/f/FFUpv.jpg


Panorama investigates the government's plans to end the so-called 'sick note culture' and 
their attempts to get millions of people off disability benefits and into work. In Britain's 
modern welfare state, millions are being paid to private companies to assess sick and disabled 
claimants but is the system working? Or are new tests wrongly victimising those who deserve 
support the most?
