wow u really are an ungrateful piece of fucking shit. dvd-rip was just released the other day and that's still not good enough for you?? how about you go and spend $15 and go and see it in the cinema..hopefully there is a massacre in that cinema when you are there"

so you're dissing me because i asked a simple question? Well. I didn't watch DVD rip, but I've watched movie in the cinema 2 times,and now I'm just asking YIFY when will Blu Ray rip come out,because i collect his movies on external HD...i dont know how you can be that quick to judge people,but your response is just incredible...i didn't get mad because of your response,just dont judge people that quick.
Also...unrelated from this topic,i wanna thank YIFY for uploading all these BR Rips"
