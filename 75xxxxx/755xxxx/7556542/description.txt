The Recital to End All Recitals
 Original Airdate: August 21, 2012 Abby's annual recital for the Abby Lee Dance Company shakes up the studio and the dance moms when she assigns a style of dance they have never done before. Potential disaster then arrives when Cathy and her Candy Apples crash the recital.

It would be great to see some gratitude from the thousands of people that download this show without ever saying thanks.
For the very few that do, you're welcome
