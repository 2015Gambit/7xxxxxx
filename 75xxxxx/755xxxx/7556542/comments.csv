I know how hugely popular this show is so I pulled some strings to get it capped early."

,annacookie,2012-08-22T15:55Z,"Dear Rkstr: 

Thank you so much for week after week putting up the Dance Moms series.

I hear Dance Moms Miami is starting again soon too.... Look forward to you putting them all up! 

I do not know why but Dance Moms seems to be very addictive haha! 

Hope you are having a wonderful day :) "

Once again Thanks :)"
[T],rkstr,2012-08-30T02:08Z,Itunes uploaded the wrong episode yesterday which I uploaded in good faith as I don't watch the show and didn't know it wasn't the latest..I submitted a support request and was told they would look into it and check back in a few weeks!! I guess they don't want to spend their precious hundreds of billions of dollars swapping one file for another.I'm in the process of tracking down another copy of the show
