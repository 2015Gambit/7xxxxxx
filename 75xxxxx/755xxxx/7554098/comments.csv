MOVIE: 0-
Not even the Bad Cinema Society would accept it., 21 August 2012
If you are a fan of movies that seem to have been directed by little five year old girls than this is it. Otherwise do not rent this movie and definitely do NOT waste your time and money on seeing it at the cinema. It'll just leave you feeling like you wanna jump off the nearest skyscraper.

Picture you and your friends goofing around with a camera in one hand and a bong in the other. That is about how the acting was in a nutshell. I turned it off after about 18 seconds of skimming it thru. IT WAS THAT BAD! The budget must have been around 50 dollars to finance this ""movie"" and thats including the dope. I wonder if the actors got paid for this. They probably had to pawn the video camera afterwards and resell the dope...if there was anything left. How can these kinds of ridiculous movies be allowed to slip out onto the market."

,Fiendycake,2012-08-23T02:31Z,"The entire point of this movie was to be bad. And given that it's an indie movie, of course the budget is small. Even pretending to be this outraged at something you got FOR FREE is just ridiculous."
,tonguefu,2012-09-12T16:10Z,"@ dbag . . . Listen up, smart fella, ooops, I mean fart smeller, bad is bad, even if it is free. Even if the point is to be bad, there is good bad, and shitty bad. And is it free? You spend for IPS, for electricity, and your time (is money), so not really that free. But even so, shit is shit is shit and no one likes to eat shit, smell shit, or roll in shit. "
