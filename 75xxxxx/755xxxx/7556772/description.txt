Director Sadhu Kokila's claim of writing the story and screenplay for his new directorial venture "Mr. Theertha" has to be taken with a pinch of salt.Sadhu has exhibited a rare courage, which is not uncommon in the Kannada film industry, to take the credit for writing the screenplay and story of "Mr. Theertha"Sadhu Kokila has included a comedy sub plot in the script that has a message for the star-struck fans. The strength of "Mr. Theertha" is that it has retained all the good points of "Sphatikam" while ignoring the strong native elements in the original.
