,mw2merc,2012-08-21T08:24Z,"It may be a WineSkin wrap. DL WineSkin Winery & get the newest engine (WS9Wine1.5.10), Rclick the game .app & choose show contents, if it is a Wine wrap, run the Wineskin.app, click Advanced > Tools > Change Engine Used & select the new one & click OK. It will update it to the newest engine. Try it again. I've been using 1.4.1 myself on games I've made."
