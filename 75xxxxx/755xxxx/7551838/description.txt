Overview: Color & Draw is a complete artistic solution for PHONES. It invites kids to draw and color. Coloring pages have voice over invitations to get kids' creative juices flowing.


APP FEATURES

* Fun, age-appropriate themes: animals, professions and natural settings
* Save drawings to the in-app Art Gallery, your device photo album or share them via email
