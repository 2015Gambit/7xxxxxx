Weight of the Nation Season 1

Three years in the making, The Weight of the Nation brings together the country's leading research institutions in a national initiative to help shed light on solutions to restore our individual and collective health. The centrepiece of The Weight of the Nation is the 4-part documentary series that features case studies and interviews with experts as well as individuals and families struggling with obesity. Each part focuses on a particular issue: "Consequences," examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese; "Choices," reveals the science behind obesity and weight loss; "Children in Crisis," documents the impact the epidemic is having on the nation's children; and "Challenges," examines the major forces behind the obesity epidemic.
Parts 5 to 16 are a collection of 12 films ranging in length from 11 to 30minutes each part focuses on a particular issue.




10)  Poverty and Obesity 
It's shocking to believe that, in a country as developed as ours, something as innocuous as the neighborhood you live in could so strongly affect your lifespan. When it comes to obesity and its related chronic diseases, some evidence suggests that your zip code may matter more than your genetic code. This bonus short offers a sweeping view of the issues surrounding socioeconomic disparities that can dramatically affect not just health, but life expectancy. We touch down in cities across the country and hear from local residents and preeminent thinkers on the issue.
