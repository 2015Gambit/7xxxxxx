The Avengers in progress, tomorrow will be upped.
About the encoding settings;
I've done 200-300 samples (umh vs tesa) and found out that tesa doesn't have better results at all (even though I zoomed the snap shots 2x). Maybe with some animations compressed in ridiculously small size but not with movies @ 5500-6000 KB/s.

me_range=128 I've seen in GAIA's (french team) encodes, well I've done a few as well but then again I realized that higher then 64 won't gain any quality. Also rc_lookahead=100-120 is perfect, higher values won't increase the quality (I've done a few with 180 & 200)."
