why the heck take out ""masterserver"" list? This made me angry as hell. Im unable to play online cause i need to search every damn server manually and when i find one that is NO-STEAM, the thing kicks me out cause of my ping. What can i do to make the ""internet tab"" get to work again? And where can i edit the ""masterserver"" list?"
