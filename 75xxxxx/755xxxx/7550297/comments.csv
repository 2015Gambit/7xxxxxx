thats short for commerical.. I should of edited out
the place holdcers but they were only a few seconds

voices overs arent inserted either but they have
the words for what would be said

no biggy.. diff a leaked pre-release version"
[V],psspss,2012-08-20T14:32Z,"
looks like E03 should be called Norway Mountain Part 1 (of 2)

if want to change it.

I miss that bit (as per info.txt of the web)"
[V],psspss,2012-08-20T14:36Z,"

Having it as 2 Parts really leaves it hanging

I dont like that method at all.. they would of been
better to make 2 x 1.5hr episodes (without ads)
or 2 hours with ads so you get to see
how it ends without waiting a WEEK

worse if you miss one week and never know
espc if no USA/CAN capper rips to the week for people :/"

[V],psspss,2012-08-22T00:37Z," At least these version has no on screen

defascing tv logos and ratings covering the

picture... 

a few seconds of prelease labels shouldnt worry anyone"
