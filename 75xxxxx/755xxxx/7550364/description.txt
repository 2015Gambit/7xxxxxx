Maati Maay-A Grave Keeper's Tale | x264 | MP3 | Marathi Webrip | Phantom

Marathi film 'Maati Maay - A Grave Keeper's Tale' directed by Chitra Palekar is based on a short story (named Daayen) by the well-known writer Mahasweta Devi whose other works made into feature films include, Sunghursh(1968), Rudaali(1993) and Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa(1998). It is the heartrending tale of a woman who is trapped between her natural instincts and the compulsions of her ancestral duty.

Chandi is a beautiful young woman from a scheduled caste, whose family has been traditionally in charge of a children's graveyard. When her father dies, there being no other male member in the family, Chandi inherits the job and performs it with great pride as a sacred duty. But when she becomes a mother herself, things begin to change. As a nursing mother, she starts getting upset about burying dead children and wants to be relieved of that duty. But neither the husband nor the people around understand her physical/emotional state...her moral dilemmas...her growing anxiety. When she rebels, the society, steeped in ignorance and superstitions, becomes increasingly hostile and ultimately condemns her in a harsh manner.

If Chandi gets justice in the end, it's only through the courage of her son.
