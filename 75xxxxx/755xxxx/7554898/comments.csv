[S],velvet.,2012-08-21T20:38Z,"In the future, if and when you upload another torrent, you ought to consider the following:

1. Creating a proper, relevant title for your torrent posting.
2. Uploading your torrent to the correct category.
3. Creating a useful torrent description.
4. Keeping in mind that audio and video files are not compressible, so it is pointless to RAR or ZIP them."
