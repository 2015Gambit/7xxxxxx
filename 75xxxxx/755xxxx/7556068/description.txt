"This is the place to start listening to Chuck Berry." - Bruce Eder, allmusic.com

#21 of Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of all time.

Originally released in 1982 as a double LP and single CD, this compilation is 70 mins of Chuck Berry's best songs. While other single cd compilations have come and gone since, this is still seen as the best, with only "The Definitive Collection", released over twenty years later, being seen as a competitor.
