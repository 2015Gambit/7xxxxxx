Nature's Microworlds
Documentaries exploring ecosystems around the world, It's unfortunate that this series comes so soon after Secrets of Our Living Planet. Where Chris Packham had an hour to explore small acts of symbiosis within ecosystems, Steve Backshall has to narrate the story of entire ecosystems in half that time.
