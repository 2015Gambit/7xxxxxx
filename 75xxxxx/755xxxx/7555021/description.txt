
Charles Vess Sketchbook - Number Five in the Tundra Sketchbook Series
Published by Tundra Publishing, 1991, 50 pages

I know this one is pretty rare, because I've owned it for many years and I've never seen it anywhere else. Scanned this one myself.

Mostly b&w images, some full-page - some not, some complete - some work in progress, with Charles Vess explaining his process and decisions in his own words along the way. The center of the book contains seven full-page, full-color portfolio style images.

Modern Masters Volume Eleven: Charles Vess
TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007, 120 pages

This book is along the same lines as the Tundra Sketchbook, only more detailed and with a much better layout.

In this book you get an EXTENSIVE multi-part interview with Charles Vess, many more full-page pieces of art (including the original b&w pages from several of the Charles Vess works I recently seeded) as well as numerous sketch and in progress works, and a nearly FORTY page Art Gallery.
