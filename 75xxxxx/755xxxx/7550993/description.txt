Sources - audio-tooth fairy.....Thanks :P
          VIDEO-italian.....Thanks :P
Notes -

why readnfo...the video had a lot cam movement so needed to be cut into pieces... rotate,prespective filters were used... got 

rid 95% ofthe black borders... the does change in the 2nd half of the movie.. nothin major.. can be fixed but the video needs 

more of a crop... whch would loose to much video.. the audio used was some very nice line :) re-worked the audio levels.. synced 

then muxed over our encode... enjoy until new source drops i guess... and finally a few mins of video is missng around 2mins 

20secs..
