In 1997, no one in the small town of Redford, Texas (pop. 100) knew that U.S. Marine teams, fully camouflaged and armed with M16 rifles, had been secretly deployed to their section of the border.

The Ballad of Esequiel Hernandez tells a frightening and cautionary tale about the dangers of using military as domestic law enforcement -- a role that the military, under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, had been prohibited from taking. That changed when in 1989, the George H.W. Bush administration declared drug-trafficking a "threat to national security" and authorized the deployment of thousands of troops to the US-Mexico border. In 1997, during the Clinton administration, Esequiel Hernandez became the first American killed by U.S. military forces on native soil since the 1970 Kent State shootings. 

Narrated by Tommy Lee Jones (a native of west Texas whose film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada was inspired by the Hernández shooting), The Ballad of Esequiel Hernandez features a full array of remarkably candid accounts from three of the four Marines on the fatal mission; Esequiel's family, friends and teachers; Marine Corps investigators; FBI and defense attorneys. The film also makes use of military investigative video and audio recordings of radio communication between the Marine team and their commanders before Hernández was shot. 

Both the Department of Defense and the Justice Departmant blatantly lied about the incident, covering up the truth that a Marine murdered a good Texan.

Tried ripping subtitles with SubRip to srt but ran into lots of trouble. Have included sub/idx files used by most players. Spoken Spanish has burned-in English subs onscreen.
