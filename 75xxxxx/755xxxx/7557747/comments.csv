,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-22T20:28Z,"@iJ0NA5: Your computer's/bittorrent client's measuring in the decimal units. It's taking the file size in bytes (in this instance 10564947778) and dividing by 1000000000 (10564947778รท1000000000=10.56 gb). On a Windows PC, you divide by 1073741824 (10564947778รท1073741824=9.84  gb). TPB and Windows use the same units, different from what you're using hence the difference.  You're not downloading anything extra."
