HP dv9000 + dv9500 TV Tuner (Software + Drivers) - Windows XP-Vista-7
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Insert your TV Tuner Card into the Express Card and install HP TV Tuner Drivers:

a) HP Analog TV Tuner (YUAN EC680 Express Card 54) = yInstallTools.exe
IMPORTANT: Right-click the .exe and choose "Windows XP" in compatibility tab if you have Windows Vista / 7

b) HP DVB-T TV Tuner (YUAN EC300 Express Card 34) = HP_Tuner_DPInst.exe
IMPORTANT: Right-click the .exe and choose "Windows XP" in compatibility tab if you have Windows Vista / 7


2) Install HP TVplay application = setup.exe
IMPORTANT: Right-click the .exe and choose "Windows XP" in compatibility tab if you have Windows Vista / 7
TIP: You can also install "HP QuickPlay 3.7" (see my other torrents) instead (it has TV Tuner support included) but if you don't want the whole app, it's easier to install just the TVplay app provided in this torrent.


3) Start the TVplay app, follow the wizard to scan for channels and then click live tv


4) Enjoy & seed !
