It's all political agenda, nothing to do with security of survival."

Look, I enjoy watching conspiracy movies as well, because their entertainment value is unparallel to other documentaries. I just can't believe people actually buy into them. Its a riot seeing how some americans are terrified of the United Nations, an organisation so weak it can't even pass resolutions verbally condemning occupations or acts of violence. They are not going to invade your country so you can just relax. Nor are the communists:)"
