Trojan Remover aids in the removal of Malware - Trojan
Horses, Worms, Adware, Spyware - when standard anti-virus
software either fails to detect them or fails to effectively
eliminate them. Standard antivirus programs are good at
detecting this Malware, but not always good at effectively
removing it
