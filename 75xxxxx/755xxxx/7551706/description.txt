Indian film soundtrack music, remixed.

The disc leaps forward into the electro-ΓÇÿ80s, when Bollywood soundtracks moved on from funk to the kind of drum machine-driven, synthesizer heavy sound found on shows like ΓÇ£Miami ViceΓÇ¥. More importantly, most of the tracks here began as short, scene-long snippets of music that have been augmented into full-length songs by an impressive roster of DJ/producers, including Kid Koala, Mix Master Mike, and Dynamite D.
