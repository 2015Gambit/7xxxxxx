Thank you in name of others and mine. You made seven people happy."

,Dadams9,2012-08-21T21:25Z,Can you please do this and Revenge DC in 720p?
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-22T07:18Z,"I can't upload Novecento in 720p, every part wold be bigger than my limit, and both would be over the top. Be aware that video quality of ANY Italian produced move from 1970-1990 is the lowest one can find, and as my encode gets source as it is - 720p or not make no difference, assuring better quality. Point being that 576p is better and logic choice.

Regarding Revenge: Director's cut is shorter by 30 minutes than ""normal"" movie. Therefore, I tagged ""normal"" as ""Extended"".
Both Revenge.1990.BluRay.Dir.Cut.480p.H264 and Revenge.1990.EXTENDED.HDTV.720p.H264 would be re-uploaded when times come (alphabetically). ""Extended"" exists as HDTV only."
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-22T09:53Z,@x5x5x71: I get The.Warriors.Way.2010.BluRay.480p.H264 from you with 12 -12.6 KB/s. My ETA calculates as 5h4m.
