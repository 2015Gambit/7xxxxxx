Set in Italy, the film follows the lives and interactions of two boys/men, one born a bastard of peasant stock (Depardieu), the other born to a land owner (de Niro). The drama spans from 1900 to about 1945, and focuses mainly on the rise of Fascism and the peasants' eventual reaction by supporting Communism, and how these events shape the destinies of the two main characters.

please, seed it for a while and add new working trackers (simply copy and paste it from/in Properties of specific torrents) from my latest torrents (old ones may not work) and point torrent program to place where the content is on your HDD. After Recheck and 100%, seeding will start automatically. If you have done something wrong in doing aforementioned, simply Remove the torrent in question (not the content/data) and start all over again. It is really simple, needs maybe a minute and after few tries you'll get it right.

I do not have files locally since my HDD crash in 2011 and I am waiting for so long for seeders (I am not alone on some).
As usual, unblock my OVH based server (by some PeerBlock list or defective ipfilter list).

Thank you.
