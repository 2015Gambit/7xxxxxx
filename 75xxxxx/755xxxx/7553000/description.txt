Elton John
November 14th 2011
Crocus City Hall, Moscow, Russia

SOUNDBOARD

Midas XL8>EMU 0404USB>Cubase5>Wavelab6/WavesR7>WAV(24kHz/16-bit)>Sound Forge 8>Flac Frontend>FLAC

Sound was excellently mixed and mastered by drusilla2 (EMU 0404USB>Cubase5>Wavelab6/WavesR7), 
so credits should go to him as well as to unknown person who recorded the concert at Moscow's 
Crocus City.

There is no real crowd in recording, so it goes silent between tracks (originally it was IEM source). 
At my thought this is the one of the best Elton's SBD recordings appeared last years. See music samples.

The only disappointing thing was the inadequate cutting of the songs in the original recording. The 
beginning of most songs (in 80%) was left in previous tracks. I had to correct it by the transfer of 
the end of some tracks to the beginning of the next ones. Also I split 3 tracks containing two songs 
into individual ones (Sound forge 8 + FlacFrontend were used).
