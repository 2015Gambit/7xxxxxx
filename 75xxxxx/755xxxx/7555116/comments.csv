,shamanist,2012-08-21T22:59Z,"Guess it says a lot about ""today's new 'american' patriot"" that this list has some reputable books and then books by the nutjobs..."
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-21T23:06Z,"Hey, if you don't like Glenn Beck or David Barton, then you might want to just keep your mind shut down.  Until you actually READ the books, you really shouldn't bother commenting...

THere are a TON of very respectable books in this collection and thus far - aside from calling the authors ""Nut Jobs"" - no-one ever seems to actually provide any FACTS that disputes anything they have to say...

You see - when you start calling someone names, it means you lack all intellect to be able to actually argue their points.  

It's like most Liberals - they can't win the arguement so they shout ""Racist Bigot"" and run away...  So run away little man...  the New American Patriot doesn't scare as easy as Occupy Wall Street - in fact, we actually are looking forward to that fight."
,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2012-08-22T01:19Z,"As an Australian looking in from the outside, I have to wonder how tolerant anyone is of others' views. 

For example, these books suggest to me that unless you follow their philosophies then you aren't a patriot or loyal American. "
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T02:09Z,"Actually, quite the contrary...  if you look at the books in this list, you'll find plenty from BOTH sides...  in fact, ""The Little Blue Book"" is currently considered the definative book on Liberal Thought and what the Democrats in the US believe in, and how they need to combat the right in this country.

Other books in list are also HISTORICALLY accurate books...  These are just books that many Patriots in this country are using to learn more about what our country was founded on.  

It's hard to say they are opinions, when the majority of them are NOT opinion based books, rather books based on Factual History.  

As well, these books represent a lot of ideas that are on BOTH sides of ruler here in the United States.  Meaning, that if you read enough of them, you'll find yourself more educated about the American Political Process, our Politicians, and REAL Factual American History than 98% of our country is.  

Yeah, I'm saying that the problem with the United States is not the 99% vs 1% in wealth...  its 98% lack Factual Knowledge to make an informed decision and only 2% actually have it.  Which is probably why only about 30% of all Registered Voters actually go to the polls...  the majority of them have no clue what they are voting on in the first place...  "
,smartass33914,2012-08-22T02:16Z,THANK YOU FOR THESE!!! YOU ROCK PATRIOT!
,Ruby5,2012-08-22T02:43Z,"True ""Patriots"" would have started a revolution by now( and not with words). We have been taken over by a bloated, money and power centered political behemoth that will take all your rights, not just those who think they deserve them. both sides are evil and both sides play to the true threat, which is the money and power behind the political pawns.
our forefathers knew this, that's why they laid down their lives to kick out oppression and we need to take up that cause again NOW.

From a so-called ""liberal"""
,Vikingman1111,2012-08-22T03:19Z,"Anything that calls itself ""TheAmericanPatriot"" must lack some kind of realistic identity."
,wonderwang,2012-08-22T03:52Z,Anyone who Voted OBAMA is certainly not Patriot....not an American Patriot anyway.
,ercwynn,2012-08-22T06:47Z,Because the freedom to vote is too much for you? 
,Phaedron,2012-08-22T09:00Z,"Regardless of what some might say, I thank you for putting these and others up here and look forward to other titles from you.  Let freedom ring!"

Whoa...quick to jump down anybody's throat who offers any comment or insight. So much for free speech, eh?

You ASSUME I haven't read Beck or any other of the nutjobs. Have. Need to know what the other side of the track spouts. So, by your own roll as judge and jury, I can comment. Not that I need your approval, obviously...

As for facts, sure I could take up space shooting them down here. Or if anybody has a brain, they could google for info and facts to shoot the la-la boys down... You might try it yourself and report back to me if you actually used your 'open mind'.

Again, another assumption. I can serve up a name, or perhaps better, a 'descriptive title' for some of these dingdongs, and it does nothing to effect my IQ. Simply saying that a pickaxe is the wrong tool for cutting a diamond seems to make me stupid and ineffectual only in your eyes.

And yet another assumption. Actually I have spent the better part of 60 years being an independent. I have complaints with the liberals and the so-called liberals. I have greater complaints with the neocons, reactionaries, goosesteppers and similiar ilk that prance around  assuming that they all know what is best for the world.

Have no fear, child. I won't run away. Someof have tostay to provide a reality check for the chicken cluckers...

And I am sure you are looking for some sort of fight. Warning though--nobody ever really wins a fight. It is funny, but I remember hearing some of these same words coming out of Munich in the 20s. And after a stay in prison, some of these same 'fighters' went on to take over the German government...

Actually, if you want to boast that you have factual historical works in your collection, you might include Zinn's People's History of the United States. Or you might include Beard's classic Economic Interpretation of the Constitution. 

Anyway, for your contribution and sharing you are to be thanked. That is the real spirit behind TPB, sharing what we value. While you may disagree with anything I have to say and dismissed it out of some sense of superiority, I hope that we could agree on that one point..."
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T20:37Z,"@Shamanist - Don't know where you got the ""So much for free speech..."" from - you might want to reread my post - it said ""shut your mind"" not ""shut your mouth""...

The majority on the left these days are revising what History has already proven.  You'll note alot of teh books by Joeseph Ellis for example, considered by many in Acadamia as a ""scholor"" of ""History"" - but only the history that he wants to believe, and not the history that is based on the very people who he writes about.  You see, by leaving things out of context, you can derive the most horrendous positions on a variety of subjects.  Especially if you present them in contrast of the liquidated, watered down values that we call ""Morality"" today.

The voting block today is so uneducated (obviously by seeing who it has been voting for over the past 20 years) that it becomes necessary to educate them from BOTH sides of the coin.  But the problem is, simply put, common sense can not be taught....  (Obviously as proven in the remarks made by @VikingMan who seems to think he's clever and witty - but has an IQ of a dead cat.)

The matter is simple...  Educate yourself - Read - From all sides of the aisle - and keep in mind - just because a man has a PhD next to his name, doesn't mean he knows a single thing about what he's writing about.  In fact, chances are, he was taught what he knows from someone who didn't have a clue.

Those who can't do...  teach...  and apparently - those who can't learn...  teach too."

I often just connect to TPB to read intelligent comments about everyday concerns. 

So you say all teachers can't do (history proves else) - what a overly simplified statement from an obvious overly confident idiot. "
,flashback00,2012-09-04T22:10Z,Thank you for all of these books. I am a Patriot!
,pitbeals,2012-09-13T17:37Z,"Thanks for these!  I've always believed that the more a person learns about another's beliefs, the more he can be certain of his own."
