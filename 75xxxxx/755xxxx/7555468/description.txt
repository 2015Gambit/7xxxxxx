VEER - ZAARA

*2004*

720P Blu-ray Rip x264
DTS 24 bits Audio
Multi Subs

My notes:
Hopelessly YrF didn't do justice to this great movie for the BD transfer:
- Colors are damped & lifeless
- Details, where are the details ???
- Gamma gone wild
- Mosquito Noise
It was time to take the burden to give justice to this movie as I never did a rip of
this movie except a remux BD25.
As we now have some new HD avisynth functions based on Masktool2 filters,
here is the result of some long nights testing and team work.
Thanks to Maddy for the color correction as my eyes are too old to do it as good as he does.
Hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I do.
