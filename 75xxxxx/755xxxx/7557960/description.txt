For ones with/in doubts, "inner" questions and voyeur tendencies:

Get proper, good torrent-program
with MediaInfo plug-in, NFO viewer plug-in
and STOP asking for things already present.
Or get hell out of my torrents and choose ones you need.

So - here is no waste of dozens KB in page content just to
repeat content of NFO file.

It is not needed anymore.
It's archaic and obsolete.
Doing right-click in your torrent client is easier:

please, seed it for a while and add new working trackers (simply copy and paste it from/in Properties of specific torrents) from my latest torrents (old ones may not work) and point torrent program to place where the content is on your HDD. After Recheck and 100%, seeding will start automatically. If you have done something wrong in doing aforementioned, simply Remove the torrent in question (not the content/data) and start all over again. It is really simple, needs maybe a minute and after few tries you'll get it right.

I do not have files locally since my HDD crash in 2011 and I am waiting for so long for seeders (I am not alone on some).
Of course, I do need these to have it or watch it myself. It is for having them and seeding long and fast.
As usual, unblock my OVH based server (by some PeerBlock list or defective ipfilter list).

Thank you.
