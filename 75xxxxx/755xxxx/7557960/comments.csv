,janedoe50,2012-08-23T00:13Z,"In my opinion, your encodes have always been  the best for whatever file size you choose. So I waited for this 720p upload and then I watched it before I came back to comment.

A10+ V10+ Exceptional. 
I expected the encode to be good, as always, but this is amazing. Video is very crisp and clean! I don't have a BluRay player, but this is what I would expect it to look like.

Thank you for the quality of the work you do. Thank you for sharing. I have a bandwidth limit but I will seed as long as I can.

P.S. I see that your stalker has discovered that you're back. What a pathetic little person."
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-23T11:21Z,"Thanks.

@janedoe50: Thank you for compliments. And yes, stalker(s) are in action again, especially one, who after his six! accounts have been disabled continue his ""minus-madness"" from account left. TPB is obviously impotent to do things right after Idiots United joined with Morons Bros & Co drove me out from public pig-hole.

It doesn't matter what I say, or have said, or begged - TPB consider been ""public"" as been sand-box for loonies, same as Youtube. Have you ever seen nastier and so low shit as on Youtube and TPB comments? So concentrated on one place? I avoid reading it as much as I can, but here is very hard to skip it, because I must read all comments to see if anybody is in need...

Well, until stalker receive confirmation e-mails how TPB opened new accounts he can use to ponder with minuses and use FireFox iMacro extension (what a disgrace for such fine browser to allow hacking-tool) as vote-bot - we can enjoy beauty of just one minus when he wants to get hard."

[V],twentyforty,2012-08-24T21:14Z,"Said gazillion times, but worth repeating:

""Requests must contain IMDB link. Request must contain valid reason Why do you ask for it and do not go someplace else.
Re-seed requests must contain link to specific torrent.
Any type of Requests should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
Re-seed request should contain exact time and time-zone you're in. Google. My Time Zone is CET, so do the math before.
Re-seed time-window is 1 day. If you have slow connection meaning, you cannot finish download in that time-frame, just forget about re-seeding and especially loading of old, dead torrents.
Re-seed chances are good for single torrents within one year of original day of upload.
Chances for re-seed of Pack-torrents and single TV episodes are slim to none.
In short - if I have something (and is physically present) - I would definitely re-seed.
You should just ask - nicely, in civilized and aforementioned manner, of course.
If you've done something wrong on my torrents - ever - do not bother to ask.

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.""

,JP323,2012-08-25T17:42Z,Hi twentyforty great quality. BUt maybe you can help me. I put the movie on my harddrive and watched it on my flat screen tv but when it gets close to the big fight seen it starts to skip little by little on the video. When i rewind back the skipping stops but then the audio cuts off. What can i do to fix this?
