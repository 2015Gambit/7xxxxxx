BUT! this US version of the excellent British original is fucking awful...terrible.....unwatchable and frankly, not worth your time d/l"

,Merkarov91,2012-08-25T02:34Z,"honestly if you haven't seen the uk version, watch it first.. this is a pitiful copy."
,dee60,2012-08-28T20:02Z,Thanks for sharing.
,420bluntdragon,2012-08-30T00:07Z,If I watch this and like it I WILL NOT watch the 'old uk' version because it's fucking old and from the uk. mostly because it's old though. old shit is for scrubs.
,JackPersil,2012-08-31T19:48Z,"Okay, so you were right Uk version was 10 times  better the Us version feels so shallow now. Thanka for setting me straight guys."
