The cobbled, wine-stained streets of France and America will  sing: ""No Subtitles, No Subtitles, No Subtitles...""   
If any of the Connected Children can speak in the tongue of the Romanian grand-mothers.... Oh Romania, ""Lend us your ears"" ....
 or the western churches will fear, for the shades  of Vampyre-Father Ceaucesceau, his brood-clutech and the armies of subterranean half-ling demons should never ever ever ever be at rest beneath thee! 
Enough now . . . Run back, to work! Hurry before the night returns. Education is the only light they fear!"
