,giulianojk,2012-08-21T00:19Z,Can you play that on VLC?
,sjw71,2012-08-21T00:21Z,"Very much appreciated Bozx but same here, waiting on a 10 gigger. :D"
,ikmusic,2012-08-21T00:24Z,thanks! waiting for a smaller file though.
,Venturai,2012-08-21T00:26Z,"This is the 3D version. They do also have the 2D version over at PublicHD that's a couple of gig less than this. I'll be waiting for an encode around 10 to 15gig though, the full is just too big a download."
,TrexWarrior,2012-08-21T00:28Z,Gee willikers Batman 41GB! 
,spanish_ruler,2012-08-21T00:50Z,"Geeee [publicHD] i have 5TB in my pc and even this is too big for me lol.... Great job and very much appreciated, but i'll wait for smaller too "
,trntz-man,2012-08-21T02:04Z,"Personally, I love the BIG size files, I just bought a 3TB external drive for my Western Digital HD TV Live box. I don't have a 3D TV yet, going to get one this weekend. I am downloading it because my first movie needs to be perfect, crisp, and no loss resolution."
,iraqe,2012-08-21T02:53Z,Size large wait smaller size 
,mrovariz,2012-08-21T03:35Z,Is a Joke. This film is a Titanic Bluray.
,soletar,2012-08-21T06:34Z,"41GB? i envy you guys with awesome bandwidths.... if i ever download a film like this, it will take maybe 4months (am in the 3rd world) and even then if i download a porno of this size, i must be able to dip my dick into the TV and fuck the actresses...

For a film of this size, i insist on getting the Ironman armour as a bonus!"
,PAPAI_GELADO,2012-08-21T07:30Z,"Guis, guis, seriously, guis. 
If I watch it on a normal 2D LCD full HD screen, will it get blurry, like when you take off your 3D glasses at the cinema? 
Please i.i"
,Itbankrock,2012-08-21T07:43Z,41 GB!!?!! I only have friggin 400kB/s connection!  That would take at least 2 days straight! I'm waiting for 10GB or less 1080p ripoffs :D
,Ship_Modeler,2012-08-21T08:27Z,"41 GIG!!!  Geesh, I know it's 3D but crap.  I'll pass and wait for a 9 GIG."
,escalade83,2012-08-21T10:31Z,"It's a bluray idiots, this is normal size. Download or GTFO"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-21T10:34Z,"This is meant to be burnt on a Bluray Dics, not stored on your hard drives so stop complaining about the size. Wouldn't take more than a day to download (once there are more seeders than leechers) and it'd be in perfect quality."
,hotslized,2012-08-21T11:15Z,WTF? 41.8 fucking gb? 
,krilo1950,2012-08-21T14:01Z,"This is 3d, I get it, but does it also contain 2d, like you can choose between those two standards within the disc? If notis there a 2d Blu Ray full rip? Thnx!"
,whizzler,2012-08-21T15:55Z,one of the coolest upload of all time

,darktonian1,2012-08-22T22:21Z,How do mount the image and play the files... when i click on the file it asks me to burn the image.... what do i do?
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-23T13:22Z,darktonian1: Download Demon Tools and use it to first add a virtual SCSI drive and then mount the downloaded iso file / disk image onto the virtual BD-ROM you've created.
,Debadattajash,2012-08-23T17:21Z,"holy shit!!! 41 gb!!
