The Hodges Brothers~Bogue Chitto Flingding (Arhoolie) [320KB] {MKOP}

Bogue Chitto Flingding collects various sessions recorded by the Hodges Brothers and by Chris Strachwitz throughout the '60s as well as one side of a trumpet single recorded in 1951. This is Mississippi string band music, with plenty of prominent fiddle courtesy of Felix Hodges (brother Ralph plays some nice guitar, too). The Brothers are fine singers and harmonizers, but the instrumental fiddle tunes are especially fine. Because their hometown of Bogue Chitto was so rural, the music they played sounded as it had for decades in that area (though not without some more contemporary flourishes). But because they were recorded in the '50s and '60s, the recording quality is much better than many string band recordings. Arhoolie has been documenting American roots music of all types for decades, and this is another reason to thank them. Good stuff.~Sean Westergaard (Allmusic) 

"Old time Mississippi country music. This would be a great CD either if you are a bluegrass fan or and old time music fan. Infact one of the best parts about this CD is that you can hear influences of both the old time brother duets and string bands, as well as Bill Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs and the great bands of the 40s-50s.''
