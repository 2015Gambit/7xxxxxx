There are several different retail and rental versions, and some defective discs which won't play properly anyway. So it might take awhile longer for DVDFab to sort it all out and fix the Hunger Games DVD completely. AnyDVD 7.0.6.4 claims that it has already done so, but I haven't verified..."

It does work for Hunger DVD and the f'i'x' works with 8.2.0.3..."
