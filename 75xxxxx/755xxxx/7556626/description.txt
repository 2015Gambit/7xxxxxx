How has war shaped modern society and vice versa? How has it changed over the centuries between the introduction of firearms and the invention of the atomic bomb? How is war waged today?
 This highly informative work examines the techniques, technology, and theories of warfare from the 'military revolution' of the seventeenth century to the present day. Expert contributors explore major developments and themes, including: the extraordinary achievements of Napoleon's armies; the role of nationalism in battlegrounds as various as the American Civil War and the former Yugoslavia; colonial wars; the concept and reality of 'total war;' guerrilla warfare and 'people's wars.'
A History of Modern War offers a comprehensive overview of military conflict over several centuries, with fascinating thematic chapters covering air and sea warfare, combat experience, technology, and even opposition to war. It is the ideal supplementary text for courses on modern history and it is especially useful for anyone broadly curious about modern war.
