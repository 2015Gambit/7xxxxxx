Music was paramount in New Orleans, a town where they liked jazz with their blues. Regular blues musicians like Richard ‘Rabbit’ Brown got on disc when the record companies came to town. In general bluesmen and women came from out of town for their sessions, Texans like Lillian Glinn, Will Day, Oscar Woods and Blind Willie Johnson or Mississippians Bo Carter, the Mississippi Sheiks and Walter Jacobs, or out-of-towners like Little Brother Montgomery. New Orleans also saw the first recordings by fascinating Cajun musicians like Amédé Ardoin, Dewey Segura, Lawrence Walker and Cléoma Falcon, who put down their version of 12-bar blues.

New Orleans became a blues town in the late 1940s, when the likes of Roy Brown, Smiley Lewis, Professor Longhair, Fats Domino, Lloyd Price, Guitar Slim, T-Bone Walker, Little Richard and Ray Charles made their way to Cosimo Matassa’s tiny studio to lay down a series of classic songs that defined rhythm & blues. The city had the best backing musicians, too, who took wild, jazz-inflected solos while laying down rhythm tracks that managed to be both loose and tight. Bluesmen like Papa Lightfoot, Boogie Bill Webb, Roosevelt Sykes and Elmore James kept their music righteous, along with Jesse Allen, Earl King, Pee Wee Crayton, Eddie Lang and Sammy Myers.Memorable songs collected here include ‘Good Rockin’ Tonight’, ‘The Fat Man’, ‘Stack-A-Lee’, ‘The Things That I Used To Do’, ‘Let The Good Times Roll’, ‘Directly From My Heart’, ‘Mardi Gras In New Orleans’, ‘Dust My Blues’, ‘I Wonder Who’ and the original ‘See You Later Alligator’. Who said the blues has to be sad?
