                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Fifty years after the child murderer's confinement, this Cutting Edge 
 documentary examines the infamous prisoner's attempts to influence and 
 control individuals around him, such as solicitors and psychiatrists. Brady's 
 mental health advocate, an executor of his will, reveals startling information 
 presenting further evidence of the murderer's continuing efforts to assert power 
 over his victims' families.
