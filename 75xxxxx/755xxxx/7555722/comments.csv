,brittanylee,2012-08-23T03:58Z,Has anybody downloaded this yet? I don't feel safe taking things from anonymous... But it's the only one up. :(
,fall1en,2012-08-23T09:46Z,"Thank you, but will wait for a 720p version, if one makes an appearance.

Cheers!"
,Potetoe,2012-08-23T15:26Z,"@Brittanylee: I downloaded it, and it is a valid/working video file (avi I think, but I'm on a different computer right now). Also would have preferred a more 'reliable' torrent source but, yeah, only one up.
Also share same wish for 720p but it was worth the download anyway; really good episode. Many thanks to anon for putting it up."
