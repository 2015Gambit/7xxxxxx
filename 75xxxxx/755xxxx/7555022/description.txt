Winning is everything. That's what Virgil Lordd's daddy always taught him. 

Dr. Whitney must now decide if the story of Virgil's life is enough to keep him in prison or spend the rest of his life in a mental institution. 

Join Dr. Whitney as he follows Virgil's journey as a child, dealing with his parents and the harsh reality they showed him in life.

Join him as a teen and see how he took those lessons and turned them against those who taught him.

And as an adult with his wife, Tara Hodge Lordd. See how he showed her the only life he had known.

That winning is everything.
