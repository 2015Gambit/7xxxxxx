Calypsos From Trinidad: Politics, Intrigue & Violence in the 1930's (Arhoolie) {320KB] {MKOP}

A favorite CD of the classic 1930s calypso recordings, this stresses calypsos about the labor troubles in the Trinidadian oil fields in 1937. Many beautiful and poignant songs are included such as the Growling Tiger's "The Gold in Africa" (about Italy's invasion of Ethiopia) and "Money Is King" (about the depression), Executor's "Shop Closing Ordinance," the Roaring Lion's "Bargee Pelauri," Atilla's "Commission's Report" (about a British report of the riot of the striking oil field workers), and Radio's "Sedition Law" (about the censorship of calypso).~Don Hill (Allmusic)
