As I was re-reading Hulk 312 and 313, I see that, ΓÇ£thereΓÇÖs an awesome, slam-bang conclusion to this entire crossover saga awaiting [me] in Alpha Flight 28 and 29!ΓÇ¥  When I went to view these comics in my Alpha Flight collection, I was dismayed to discover I only had a few scant copies of Volume 2 of this very interesting, Canadian, Super-Hero team saved on my hard drive.  I searched the great TPB site for ΓÇ£Alpha FlightΓÇ¥ comics, but could only locate a few copies of Volume 4.

So, after a bit more research, I found what I was looking for, and more.  I have since compiled my findings into five separate torrents, named thusly:  Alpha Flight Volume 1; Alpha Flight Volume 2; Alpha Flight Volume 3; Alpha Flight Volume 4 and Alpha Flight Miscellaneous.  All of these torrents are presented here, for your downloading/reading pleasures.

Alpha Flight is noted for being "Canada's answer to the Avengers."  Most team members have distinctly Canadian attributes, such as Inuit, or First Nations heritage.
