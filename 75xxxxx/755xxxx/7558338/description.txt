Don't bother searching in IMDb for this. It may have aired on the Russian MTV channel or on the "Snob" website only. This episode of the series is from ed2k. There are related English-language files, but TPB in their wisdom seem to think that those should have to be provided in a separate torrent. (I get a FILENAME ERROR that aborts the upload.) So search for those separately.

In mid February, a group of feminists, members of the punk music group "Pussy Riot", staged a "prayer service" performance in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and asked the Virgin to drive out Putin. A criminal case was opened against three young women under Article 213 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code. Then, they faced up to seven years in a penal colony. Guests of the "Department of State, 2" discussed the actions of "Pussy Riot" and their impact.
