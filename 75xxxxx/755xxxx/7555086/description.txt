Part 8 : Lions Leopards and Tigers - Supercats 

They inspire our imagination and haunt our dreams. Equipped with three-inch long canines and retractable claws like switchblades, big cats are among the fiercest and most fascinating four legged beasts on the planet. They are capable of taking down fleet footed antelope, two ton elephants and even human beings. National Geographic crawls through the African grassland and the swamps of India to track, capture, and reveal the ultimate engineering and stealth ambush tactics of lions, tigers and leopards.
