Reseed.

Famed Spanish director's Luis Bunuel's 1954 adaptation of the Dafoe classic, filmed in Mexico, where the director fled from Franco's dictatorship. A fairly straight-forward version of the yarn, it features a splendid performance from Dan O'Herlihy, whose carries most of the film alone - and won an Oscar nomination as Best Actor for his work (but lost to Brando's Terry Malloy.) Although this is considered a "restoration," the film is not all one would like it to be - the film was hastily shot in inferior Pathe color, and some of the work looks less than professional calibre. Still, it's a fast-paced version of this "ripping yarn," one that forcefully engages the viewer in castaway Crusoe's triumphs and tragedies in his quest for survival.
