,Exsss,2012-08-31T02:31Z,yes it works
,Exsss,2012-08-31T02:31Z,save takes a while to kick in tho unless turn internet off
,jailin,2012-09-03T05:33Z,"Game doesnt find any local save files so you cant continue. 

Is there a fix?"
,redeyedprince,2012-09-04T05:59Z,i can't seem to save my game locally.. how do i do this?
,sixor,2012-09-05T19:45Z,"game works fine, have not tested saving yet

looks like crap, squaresoft is a cheap mofo, the game looks better using epsxe emulator with pete ogl2 plugins, at least it can filter 2d sprites unlike this pc re-release"
