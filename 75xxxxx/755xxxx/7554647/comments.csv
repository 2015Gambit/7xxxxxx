you guys suck at installing or you pc is shit thats for sure

turn off the AV and check your HM sniper challenge game i dont know whatever shit you use i use VUZE to download i bet you guys use utorrent nevermind just force check your damn game with that sofware and download the missing files thats it install the game copy and replace crack open the game and thats it GEEZ extremezone is right learn how to fucking install kiddos"

I can also assure you my PC is not shit, software-wise or hardware-wise.

I'm gonna go ahead and try to download it again but with disabled av even before downloading."
,alexmarijuana,2012-08-21T23:07Z,"@Dem047 listen dude
i tried everything evey fucking thing
update my video card downloaded updates
i dont have an anti virus 
sooo basicaly i did everthing 
all of my other game working perfect sooo 
im pretty fucking sure thats its the game not my pc
and stop bushing us cause majority of the people that downloaded its not work 4 them.
soo before saying anything do ur research."
,MousE0910,2012-08-21T23:17Z,"OK, I thoroughly tried and tested all options, reinstalled the game several times, tried copying only some files of the crack (I tried all combinations) and I still get the Skidrow window. I tried pressing every single key on the keyboard, pressing them with SHIFT, CTRL and ALT held down, clicking the mouse at various spots, both buttons + wheel. Nothing happened at all. The only thing I noticed is that the animation in the skidrow window freezes when you press F10. It unfreezes when you press anything else or F10 again.

If you try to run the game without the crack, nothing executes at all. Not even any window asking for activation/whatever.

Still, I don't think this is a fake release. I think the most probable possibility is that the developers fucked up. I'm sure that when you close the skidrow window by pressing ESC, the game is supposed to run. However, it doesn't do so - nothing happens.

If you DON'T apply the crack - nothing happens as well.

I think there's some bug in the game that prevents the game from even starting on most machines. Since some people were able to get it to work, it's obviously a hardware specific bug but a major one.

Saying that people should update their drivers or learn to install is bullshit. Installing this game (or any game) is extremely easy, the setup makes everything noob-friendly. Copying the crack is simply Copy&Paste that anybody can do. And outdated drivers might cause some game problems but they have nothing to do with the game not starting at all.

I'll try to look for some more info about this issue and get back to you if I learn anything."
,Dem047,2012-08-21T23:17Z,@nekroto holyshit man thats why i am saying you suck at installing !!! you had to do that stuff i a first place omg turn of your av and check it omg
,Dem047,2012-08-21T23:21Z,@alexmarijuana i do not know whats your pc's deal but game works 100% again i am telling you all even while downloading the torrent turn off your av and everytime when you try to play the game turn off your av 
,Dem047,2012-08-21T23:22Z,and you just need to close the skidrow window and wait for the game to start thats so simple
,nekroto,2012-08-21T23:23Z,"No, that's not necessary since I force checked it. As you can see even people with no avs have the same problem. Therefore my redownloading is sort of a desperate measure."
,Dem047,2012-08-21T23:25Z,then you definitely miss something or its your pc i dont know
,alexmarijuana,2012-08-21T23:31Z,"Dem047 i just said ...i guess u not really red..anyway
i did that stupid shit close the window the game not starts and i dont have anti virus are u dumb or something i mean srsly 
i know its legit torrent and its real but come on man 
its doesnt work for many people and u still think we dont know how to download or how to paste and copy or read instructions ...srsly what hell?"

I am not saying i did everything well at the first time no i didnt coz i missed some stuff and i started everything all over again and i made it now you do the same probably you missed too or i dont know you all say your pc is ""great"" ok then whats the problem you miss something then but what i can tell that this is working"
,MousE0910,2012-08-21T23:55Z,"After some bit of research, I was able to find out that some people can get it to work by disabling their internet connection. When I myself tried, it didn't help but maybe for some of you it may work-"
,MousE0910,2012-08-22T00:02Z,"Tried messing with Steam. Copied the game to the common folder in steamapps, tried running it offline and online both directly and through steam. No change. Still refuses to start up after the Skidrow window."
,Dem047,2012-08-22T00:02Z,wow am i the only one who got this working with no problem ? 
,AnalF1678,2012-08-22T00:04Z,"I've downloaded many skidrow releases over the years, and they have never, ever, had a cracktro in the game .exe, never mind the fact that this is also the first time my AV's told me there was a virus present in a scene release, and I've been downloading releases for decades. 

Why would skidrow suddenly incorporate a cracktro, when they didn't do so for their last release, darksiders 2? I've never had a scene crack make my AV go off either, and honestly, turning your AV off might be the stupidest thing to do at this point.

If I were any of you, I would definitely not disable my AV and wait for a proper, if this even is a real skidrow release, which I doubt."
,alexmarijuana,2012-08-22T00:04Z,"Dem047 dude i didnt say that the game doesnt work...its just doesnt work for me personally.

,Scrapith,2012-08-22T00:13Z,"@Dem047

any chance you released this thing to troll everyone else? you seem so dead set on backing up this torrent and passing the blame onto everyone else.

Its hard to miss downloading any files with this torrent, considering the torrent is only 1 file, an ISO. so if there was a problem with the iso, the game would not even install.

there is something wrong with this game, or the crack.. either way, you need take some notice of just how many people have having the same problem.

maybe the game is working for you, if so then great, have fun with it.  but try to take it easy on others, throwing around abuse helps no-one"

When I Try Start Hitman However After Installing It Every Way Possible It Refuses To Load After The Cracktro Despite Working Flawlessly On The New SpiderMan Using The Same Cracktro At Startup After Pressing Escape.

There Is A Redist Issue Im Thinking. Others That Have It Working Are Probly Fully Updated With The Most Recent Framework Or XNA. Drivers For Video Dont Seem Like An Issue Unless You Have It Working But Are Lagging Horribly. 

Despite This Being Said I Still Havent Gotten It To Work But Maybe Finding The Redist Files Required For The Game To Start."

If you do have this working, then could you please share any other ideas what the problem could be. Thanks

,Dem047,2012-08-22T14:17Z,@hungie and others i will upload a video on youtube soon to proof y'all

,Algren_San,2012-08-22T14:58Z,"Ok, so I had the same problem that all you guys seem to have. I fainally got it to work by doing this:

1. Disable AV
2. Install normally
3. Copy crack content  to installation folder
4. Install steam client and let it update (no need for registration).
5. Play 

That worked for me after a few hours of cursing."
,Rosh00,2012-08-22T15:26Z,"Yep, go ahead and disable ur AV so u can enjoy ur ZeroAccess rootkit afterwards.

5. Play the game
6. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy
**********************************
Now to everyone who is asking users to disable the antivirus to install or run the game = Get some common sense and increase your IQ. 
Why would you want to disable an antivirus and let something get installed on your system which has a virus, have you gone nuts ? are you that retarded ? wake up you dumb blondies, if Antivirus had to be disabled then wouldnt the install notes have that as a step ? this torrent has a Virus. Period. there is no point in discussing this further and blaming others that they dont know how to install a game.

,ddonindia,2012-08-22T20:52Z,"First its stupid release from SKIDROW ofcource not by  extremezone he just uploaded it!!! 

Now this release do work. Following are some issues I faced and how to overcome them.
(
  I assuming you already added hmsc_skr.dll in AV exclude files.
  I will suggest not to disable AV who knows what this bitch contains :) 
  and always use firewall ( I personaly like comodo firewall its easy and light weight 
)
1. skidrow 8bit intro screen :
                make ""Scroll Lock"" on. then it will says ""Intro Skipped ...."" 
	    then press ok. In my case it tried to connect to net. just block it with your fire wall.
2. you need latest steam client installed.( I didnt logged in to my steam user though just updated client to latest version )
	In my case after above steps it was not working. 
	Then after fallowing some suggestion from net I installed steam latest version. then It stated to come up. 

Not sure how far I can play or if it has some bugs but still it works thanks extremezone.

AND PEOPLE STOP MARKING IT AS FAKE!!!!!!
AND to my used to be favorite SKIDROW team:
why you need to put skidrow 8bit advertisement in main exe you could have put it in some separate exe if you want advertisement."

 And I love this idea that we are just supposed to trust uploaders. Not so much that this uploader is shady but that his sources are not. He isnt working for Kaspersky Lab and thoroughly testing every line of code. Who knows how many hands it is in before it gets to him...

 And quite honestly, even if it is real, SKRW is shit now. Hefty shit."
,MousE0910,2012-08-22T22:07Z,"OK, people. I finally managed to figure it all out. Point people on this comment, if they need help.

To get it working, you need to have Steam installed on your computer. You don't need to be logged in. However, here's the catch:
Steam MUST be installed in it's default folder (Program Files). If you install Steam in any different folder, the game will not launch at all.

Second thing - the scroll lock thing. If you have Scroll lock ON BEFORE you run the game, it will skip the Skidrow intro and show a message box that the intro has been skipped and to press OK to play the game. This works with the Spider-Man release as well. Pressing Scroll Lock AFTER the game was launched has no effect.

Now stop insulting each other and go play the game!"

,hellorutu,2012-08-22T23:20Z,"Guys even i was frustrated but i have installed this game. please do as below
1. disable your antivirus
2. install the game
3.copy crack
(Before continuing please read the Important Instuctions)
4.install steam using the below url
http://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi
when its installed create your account or if yu have one log on to your steam account
5. Add Hitman Sniper Challenge to your list of games in steam ie in games tab select ""add non steam game option and add the C:Program Files (x86)Square EnixHitman Sniper ChallengeHSMC.exe
Select play


Important Instructions:
Now here is the tricky part
when you install the game and copy crack before installing steam try running the game you will see a Skidrow intro screen, press scroll lock only once and close the screen, then again open HSMC.exe
you will not see the screen again
Once you have done this follow steps 4 and 5 and you should be playing the game in not less than 2 minutes

,nekroto,2012-08-23T01:49Z,"Oh god... let's sum it up.

1. Game works but for a small number of people
2. There is something wrong with the crack obviously. If we are missing a c++ redistributable or any of those shits, should have been mentioned somewhere or like on the other skidrow games, built in the installation
3. @Rosh00 and yudhistir you guys have no idea what you are talking about even though you seem smart. Except for the crack, dll, and skidrow intro getting false positives on some avs, there's nothing else suspicious installed on the system. Trust me, I've been in the malware removal world for quite some time.
4. I am disappointed that there's no proper, any additional information from skidrow or another scene release.
5. Flaming skidrow will do nothing. We should appreciate what they have done so far and will probably continue doing. But also skidrow should realize that this release was kind of a failure."

Yeah it does work! Just not for you and thats ok with me cause im enjoying it right now so have fun using your money to find out if its worth playing or not ;)"
,iLuSiVe,2012-08-23T02:00Z,"@guirir 
 It does work just not on all systems since there are how many different configurations for how many different operating systems running how many different applications on how many different hardware setups its surpriseing that they can get the majority of games to run on al theses systems to begin with so if it doesnt work for you either wait for them to release a patch fix and play one of the other 3,000 games that do work and shut the fuck up or go buy the game which is what you would be stuck doing if it wasnt for these ""asshole"" as you refer to them who do all this long and hard work just to have you bitch at them when one app has problems! Are you so selfish that you really post stupid comments about a FREE DL because it doesnt work perfectly for you when it wasnt supposed to be free for you at all?"

,Scrapith,2012-08-23T10:23Z,"Ok guys, finally got this game working myself... I will say exactly how..  btw i already had steam installed to c:gamessteam on win7 64 bit.

this guide assumes you have steam installed in any other location other than the default.

1# install hitman sniper challenge
2# copy crack files
3# delete all files in your steam folder except the steamapps folder (to backup all your games) and Steam.exe
4# copy steam folder (contents should be steamapps folder and steam.exe) to c:programfiles (x86)
5# run steam, it will redownload needed files and update itself. login
6# add hmsc.exe to steam as a non-steam game.
7# play.

keep your antivirus and firewalls turned on, block hmsc.exe access with firewall

if your on 32bit, then use c:programfilessteam
if your on 64bit, then use c:programfiles (x86)steam

Confirming this does work, problem seems to be a filepath for something is hardcoded."

you don't event need to add hmsc.exe as a non-steam game, or have steam running while you play. just tested."

The crack here is not working for many people. I found a new one. If master estremezone alows me, do the following:
1. Use this crack snd follow the instructions http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7561626/Hitman.Sniper.Challenge.Fix-SKIDROW

2. Steam Must be installed.

,zaeb,2012-08-24T12:41Z,extremezone cut the bullshit with that fix shit. it just doesnt work and its not av or any other issue. they fucked up something as simple as a stupid add on. theyr becoming more and more retard.
,ATYAGI,2012-08-24T15:08Z,Please tell me it's only a online game or not
,cost69er,2012-08-24T16:16Z,"i neva make comments but here we go....this torrent is fine just follow the instructions exclude the square enix folder in the exclusions on ur av...you must also have steam installed,,,not running just installed,,,the game started right up ...remember we were also all noobs once,,,keep em coming skidrow"

,TheNemmy,2012-08-24T23:17Z,"okay now I can confirm this it's working fine, What I had to do was :

I was on windows8 RTM x64 Enterprises

I installed fresh windows 7 x64 as dual boot

didn't install any av there

net was on 

but the game wasn't working at all double click the .exe nothing !

then I installed steam and let it update after than when I ran the game with the skidrow fix it worked, played the level (it only has 1 level) and liked it a bit..

seriously IO should be more prepared to challenge games like SC and AC...

so Now I don't blame this release.. you guys try that too."
,sati777,2012-08-24T23:44Z,"it works fine with the fix, only one level xD, so much drama, anyway big thx to EZ and SKIDROW"

,SavageGod,2012-08-25T12:52Z,"Good shit EZ as always. You could have wrote in description that the GAME WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS LONG before I beat it. WTF? 

I'm sure most people would not download this shit if they knew.

What a waste of 1GB download. Oh and fuck MSE. microsoft Security Essentials kept auto deleting the crack file before I could paste it. Uninstalling that POS Antivirus. "
,xanat0s,2012-08-25T19:11Z,"@SavageGod
Don't fucking whine if you don't even bother to read the god damned description provided by the uploader. If you had, you would have read the following line:
""HITMAN: SNIPER CHALLENGE has been created as a standalone experience
to reward fans who pre-purchase HITMAN: ABSOLUTION."""
,ZrxLvr,2012-08-25T19:36Z,"Got it work.. Seasoned Vets...why even bother with the whiners and moaners. It's simple, read the instructions. If they can't figure it out then FUCK EM !! Move on to something that does work. I dl.. check it out.. don't like it.. I DELETE IT and then I say.

THANK YOU UL.

Do you instal it before or after you install game?  Do you install it before or  after you copy and paste the crack? These are all legitimate question some who has never installed steam would ask.

If you really want to help others assume they are dummies or like you they would have the game up and running already :0) have a nice day"
