Like millions of girls her age she has read the beloved L. Frank Baum novel “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” countless times. But unlike other girls, Elizabeth believes she is Dorothy…and maybe she is. With Elizabeth referring to herself as Dorothy and constantly looking for Toto and a way back to Oz, the headmistress at the orphanage worries about Elizabeth and fears that she is losing touch with reality.
