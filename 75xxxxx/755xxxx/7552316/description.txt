Scorpions are a heavy metal / hard rock band from Hannover, Germany, best known for their 1984 rock anthem ΓÇ£Rock You Like a HurricaneΓÇ¥ and their singles ΓÇ£Wind of ChangeΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£No One Like YouΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Still Loving YouΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£Send Me an AngelΓÇ¥. The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. Along with Metallica, Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Kiss, Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne and Deep Purple they are one of the most successfull hard rock/heavy metal acts and by far the most successful German Rock band in America and England. Rudolf Schenker, the bandΓÇÖs rhythm guitarist, explained in an interview with Songfacts: ΓÇ£In the beginning of our career, we had a problem in Germany because nobody expects a German band to play Rock music. With Rock music, there are more bands from England or America, which are more exotic than the Scorpions, who are from Germany. But when we went to America in ΓÇÿ79, we became the exotic ones. They said, ΓÇÿHey, what kind of crazy guys are these?ΓÇÖ (laughs) We were already exotic, with a different view, and we also play our Rock music with a little bit of an ethnic touch. YouΓÇÖll notice that Americans come from the blues side, whereas we come from the classical side, which is different.ΓÇ¥
