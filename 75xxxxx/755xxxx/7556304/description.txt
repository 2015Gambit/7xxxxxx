Nfos:

The VSC-2 is VertigoΓÇÖs first plugin release, made in close cooperation with Brainworx, and based upon VertigoΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Big Impact DesignΓÇ¥. The VSC-2 plugin captures all the fine nuances of this 6,000$ flagship VCA compressor.

The Mercedes of VCA compressors from German manufacturer Vertigo Sound! The VSC-2 Quad Discrete Compressor is so named because it uses 4 VCAs built by hand using only discrete components. Its design is a nod toward the best VCA based compressors of the 70s and 80s.

Features
Precision
Its precision makes the VSC-2 a first choice for mastering applications and the stereo mix bus.

Tracking & Mixing
Although the VSC-2 was developed as a Stereo Bus Compressor each channel provides a complete set of controls which also makes the VSC-2 a dual mono ΓÇ£Must HaveΓÇ¥ in recording and mix situations.

Plugin
The VSC-2 plugin offers the same flexibility and precision in the stereo version, and to emulate the dual mono approach of the hardware we have developed a true mono version of the plugin as well.

A Word From Vertigo
ΓÇ£We are amazed how accurate the plugin simulates the real deal. We have compared it to the hardware several times now in a professional studio and cannot hear any difference at all. Is that good or bad?!?ΓÇ¥, says Andreas Eschenwecker, CEO of Vertigo Sound.
