Brazilian DJ Rafael Lelis' take on the single Alejandro
from Lady Gaga's 2009 album The Fame Monster.

Translated excerpt from Lelis' bio at his web site:

"In 2004, when the scene was more restricted and still
sheltered people based only on their talent, Rafael Lelis
emerged. Against the rule that says every producer has been
a DJ, Rafael began producing, and with the success of his
songs a great demand for live shows also arose from various
places in Brazil, which made him become a DJ. Today he is
one of the most successful talents in the music scene of
the country's LGBT clubs, with work that reverberates
worldwide. For years now he has been one of the main
highlights of a business in which few establish themselves,
moreover with such love and recognition from the public."
