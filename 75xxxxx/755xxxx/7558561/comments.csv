,smia0601,2012-08-25T05:34Z,having trouble viewing this; i get a 16KB file that will not open in a comic viewer application. am i doing something wrong? thanks
[T],mdusanjay,2012-08-25T16:55Z,@smia0601 ..try to download again using utorrent..u should get 15.72 mb file..
,smia0601,2012-08-26T05:19Z,"Md, thanks for the answer! Unfortunately it shows up as such in utorrent (updated version; 15.7MB as listed) but the file location has just a file, file type: 'File,' and it's a 12kb file. seems like a personal problem, I'll troubleshoot and try again. Thanks for the uploads!"
,smia0601,2012-08-26T05:48Z,I tried a couple more times. on the last (fourth?) try it worked and downloaded successful. please delete the previous comments if possible. and thanks for the upload!
