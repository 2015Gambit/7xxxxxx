,shamanist,2012-08-22T09:38Z,"How nice that some of outpatients were first to comment... Of course, these are people incapable of self-reflection and self-assessment so this book would be a waste of time for them.

@I_Qbot (?)-- you might spend a life working around the US and over the world like I did. You would find that your comment is not only wrong but seriously brings into question the ""IQ"" part of your handle...

@wonderwang-- Really? Do you really want people to think that you are that clueless? Or is this due to your sheltered existance?"
