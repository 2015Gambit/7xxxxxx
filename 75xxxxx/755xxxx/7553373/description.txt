Part 7 : Land of the Anaconda 

Enormous snakes...hungry caimans...frenzied piranhas...and a barefoot biologist! Jesus Rivas takes off his shoes to study giant anacondas in the swampy heart of Venezuela. He's searching for the slippery skin of the world's largest snake. Anacondas may be as long as 30 feet and weigh hundreds of pounds - and their weapon is sheer strength, not poison.
Powerful coils literally squeeze the life out of prey, including even the capybara, the largest rodent in the world. National Geographic cameras capture astounding underwater footage of the anaconda hunting, and document an amazing breeding ball of slithering serpents. Witness the incredible, larger-than-life creatures that inhabit the LAND OF THE ANACONDA.
