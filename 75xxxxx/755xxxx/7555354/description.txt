Would you like to live with fear or without it? The twentieth century was known as the Age of Anxiety, and the opening of the twenty-first century, with its pervasive sense of unease, has officially ushered us all into the Age of Fear. In Free Yourself From Fears, Joseph O'Connor looks at the three main types of fear: unreal fears, useful fears and cultural fears. It is our inability to get beyond these three basic types of fear that prevents us from leading richer, more fulfilling lives. Using his master NLP training, O'Connor looks at specific examples, including the fear of flying, fear of snakes and fear of other people's opinions, to illustrate dozens of practical exercises and techniques for overcoming fear and enriching your life. From financial worries to social anxiety, from public speaking to personal safety, Free Yourself From Fears show us how to unlearn our fears and find emotional freedom. This practical, hands-on book will help you to know when to trust and when not to trust, how to develop your intuition to stay safe when there is real danger, how to deal with worry and change in light of an uncertain future and, most importantly, to be in the here and now, living your life to the full. Free Yourself From Fears includes dozens of insightful methods for achieving your best, avoiding anxiety and living without worry.
