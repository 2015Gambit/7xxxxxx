TuneIn is a new way to listen to the world through live local and global radio from wherever you are. Whether you want music, sports, news or current events, TuneIn offers over 50,000 stations and 1.2 million on-demand programs for you to choose from. 

The TuneIn Radio Pro app for Android puts this entire experience in the palm of your hand with the added benefit of recording what youΓÇÖre listening to (requires memory card).

Important Update: This new version of TuneIn (5.3) includes Car Mode, which lets you listen to your favorite music, sports and news simply by speaking a command into your Android phone or tablet. This update also includes extra large buttons for easy viewing and control.

What's in this version : (Updated : Aug 21, 2012)

    You can now schedule recordings! Starting from the "Now Playing" screen of the station you want to record, just tap the settings button, select "Options," and enter the time and duration of your desired recording, tapping "save" when finished.
    Love that station or artist? Tap the heart icon to add it to your Favorites, accessible on any device with a free TuneIn account. (This feature used to be called "Presets.")
    Listen longer. We've improved TuneIn to use less battery power and data.
