,Jace0207,2012-08-23T11:40Z,"Is it just me or is this torrent missing a lot of DC comics that came out on 8-15? Batwoman, Birds of Prey, Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, DC Universe Presents, Nightwing and Redhood and the Outlaws were all released on 8-15"
,glumetzul,2012-08-26T14:53Z,"Thanks but I have one desperate question. What happened to all the comics from Disney and Warner Bros (Disney Comics, Donald, Uncle Scrooge, Looney Tunes etc)? I've noticed they haven't been posted for the last months. Is there another source where I should look for those or are they just not available anymore?"
