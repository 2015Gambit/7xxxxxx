,mido_remedie,2012-08-23T15:13Z,"Thx, had a lot to choose from this month. I know you are a fan but honestly it is simply true (I choose the best tracks from all available lists). Its frustrating that the really good (best?) lists have hardly enough seeders to download fluently. Hopefully things will change. It just needs some time for people to recognize. "
,one_of_7.500.000.000,2012-08-23T16:11Z,"Hi Mido (you blew your anonymous cover) I just listened to all four lists in one go. Yes it is that good, I could not stop listening; be proud. Maybe I like July or September from last year just a little better. Anyway, thanks again."
