Hi,

Probably the best lists I ever made. Do not let the cover fool you. Its the best Indie I could find (thank U all). Carefully ordered by sound, level and sphere to add some (emotional) logic and magic to the songs to support their sound messages (so you can play it publicly).
 
Enjoy (and do not complain about slow downloading, rather help a bit by seeding)
