,ungifted,2012-08-21T17:08Z,"kole212-I am not sure exactly what you are asking but this torrent is intended for those folks who do not have access to a mac and want to burn Mountain Lion from any PC for various reasons. Ex, if you are building a hackintosh computer then you would need this torrent because burning a proper dmg on PC is not easy. Or if your mac drive wont burn correctly for some reason then you can still burn Mountain Lion on any PC. 

If you already have a working mac there is no reason to download Mountain Lion in the ISO format! The regular dmg is just fine and there are way more seeders so it is a much faster download:

,kaabob,2012-08-24T02:39Z,ny plans on seeding a 10.8.1 version (both dmg and iso)? Beat Kings420 to seeding the dmg!

,vipergen,2012-08-29T18:51Z,Not working. I used it in along with iboot and re-starts the system all the time. How do I use it after burning it onto DVD

,moroacero,2012-08-30T21:37Z,excellent contribution .. thank you very much
,csmasn,2012-09-04T18:05Z,Is this a full install or just upgrate? TIA
,ungifted,2012-09-05T02:36Z,"quinillo- the reason it asks for an apple ID is so the operating system can use icloud and backup all your files to an apple server so of anything were to happen wit your mac you can still have your files. This is completely optional, you can skip this step if you don't have one. An apple ID is also needed to use imessage on a mac and many other useful features!"
,ungifted,2012-09-05T02:39Z,"vipergen-the reason it's not working is that you are attempting to do something that has a high chance of failure. Installing Mac OS X on a PC to make a hackintosh only works when done correctly with the right hardware. Chances are it won't work but it doesn't hurt to try, I did many times but it didn't work for me."
,ungifted,2012-09-05T02:44Z,"csmasn- The Mountain Lion operating system can be installed as an upgrade if you have Snow Leopard 10.6 with the latest updates installed or Lion 10.7. If you have Leopard or earlier then you can only do a clean install, that's if your hardware can run Mountain Lion! There are no separate version for upgrade or clean install, any Mountain Lion OS installer can do both if the prerequisites are met. "
,Starcomobi,2012-09-16T14:45Z,"I download it after a long time, because there were very few seeders. After successful download, file is showing corrupted. I can see same problem with other commented also..!
SO cant confirm Torrent is working or not!"
,ungifted,2012-09-16T19:08Z,For all those who are seeing the torrent downloaded as corrupted can you please elaborate in fine detail as to how the file is corrupted. For example is there a problem with the installation or are there any particular error messages. Saying this download is corrupted without any detail helps no one. Also this is an untouched copy of Mountain Lion so it should work! Make sure your mac hardware can support this version of Mac OS X before installing it. Mountain Lion is 64 bit only so macs that require 32 bit video graphics drivers will not work! Also if doing an upgrade (not a clean install) you MUST have at least 10.6.8 Snow Leopard installed otherwise it will NOT work. Good luck.
