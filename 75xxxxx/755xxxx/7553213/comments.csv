,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-08-21T07:20Z,"ONE THING THOUGH.....the guys will periodically talk over the music to tell the crowd that Panic is coming soon, but it doesn't really affect this rare set."
,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-08-21T22:24Z,"""Superstition"" seque's to Widespread Panic's second set.  I didn't include the 2nd set, but i thought that would be cool to hopefully share with you in the future."
,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-08-21T22:25Z,"I can't believe i left off the ""C"" in Crystal and listed it as being from NORTH CAROLINA instead of NEVADA....It was late last night when i posted it and i was extremely exhausted after a long day."
,DOOLY-WZMB,2012-08-23T00:28Z,I blasted this in the car today.  Sounds pretty good.  NOTE:  The periodic drops in volume are from Crystal Method (not the recording).
