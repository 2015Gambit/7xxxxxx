Thats to bad. Are your installation from the CORE release? Did you in that case install the included update? Because I only tested this with that specific installation (with the update).
And also, this will NOT remove the activation prompt,. It will only reset the 30 days of trial and every time you apply the reg files and try to import a video with any of the two codecs you should get a button saying Try Now in the prompt."
