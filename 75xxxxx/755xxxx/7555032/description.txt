I bought my creative sound blaster live! 5.1 audio card back in 2004, i know sometimes it's difficult to find drivers, well i am uploading the cd that came with it for the people who may want it, however i have to say that this software doesn't work on win7, i had to find some stantard driver elsewhere, and i cant get the 5.1 sound anymore. Creative no longer supports this audio card.

Hope it's worthy for you!
