The Scott Horton Show
Tuesday, 21 Aug 2012


[sebaygo1]


Scott talks about his upcoming (this Sunday) address to the P.A.U.L. [People Awakening and Uniting for Liberty] Festival, and his guest is Gigi Bowman, one of the organizers of the festival. [paulfestival.org] August 24-26.

Remember, Scott's show is now reduced from three hours to two hours in length, and apparently will be live Monday through Wednesday and on Friday. The timeslot on Thursday is taken by the No Agenda show.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
