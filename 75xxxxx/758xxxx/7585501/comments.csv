When I uploaded this book I forgot to include a word or warning. It's fun to read about the many individual crimes through history but when the author tries to explain the causes it's mostly half-baked renderings of his readings, for instance, he blames Marx for allowing the poor to take from the rich neighbour as legitimate, that's false, Marx said different, not at the individual level; for instance, in the Soviet Union there was a man once, a miser, who had saved one million rubles, a millionaire, nobody thought of confiscating it, he was only considered an eccentric who deprived himself of amenities over the years just to have a million. There is much more nonsense here, but if read only as a source of info on crimes, then it is enjoyable.

And one more thing: My own, I hope, not half-baked view of crime: It's the result of our larger brains, we are freaks of evolution, no animal kills for sadistic pleasure, enjoying inflicting pain on their victims, cats appear to play with mice but in fact they are honing their hunting skills, they kill to eat, for territory or sexual reasons, but swiftly, if they can, and with no cruelty. All of us humans because of the curse of our over-evolved brains can indulge in crime of the worst nature if circumstances make it possible or desirable. Even the worst do-gooders can turn into sadistic criminals, most of the infamous murderous SS guards in nazi concentration camps were family people, with children, who after the war, if not hanged or shot, returned to 'normal' lives.
