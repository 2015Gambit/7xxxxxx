[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-31T20:51Z,Monday and Friday next week the show will be pre-empted because of Tennis...like every year!! So only 3 shows next week!
,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2012-09-01T09:40Z,"Ms F, what's the go with the show this week? So far only two eps. Has it been pre-empted this week as well?

If so, I thought that Australian television networks were terrible for this sort of thing, particularly now that we have multi-casting (multiple channels per network) on our new fantastic super-modern space age digital TV service..."

,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2012-09-01T11:20Z,"Katie, you're right. For some reason they weren't displaying correctly in the list. They are now and I'm grabbing them.

Sorry folks and thanks again, Ms F."
