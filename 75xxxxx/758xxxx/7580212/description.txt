 Mord Fustang's We Are Now Connected (Original Mix), released in 2011 (fairly old I know) is a very nice Electro House song that sounds very similar to deadmau5, which is understandable considering the artists name is Mord Fustang (Fort Mustang), he uses sounds similar to deadmau5 but with changes to make it unique from deadmau5. (could be wrong artist but to me it sounds like a deadmau5 track).
