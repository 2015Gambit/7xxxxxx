,sthenri456,2012-09-01T13:05Z,"wow! What an incredible collection of torrents. Thank you so much. It's a fun mix of things I've been looking for but couldn't find and things I've never heard of but sound awesome. I've always had a hard time finding books by Jason, or any of the Maakies books by Tony Millionaire. Any chance you could help out with that?"

There's a pretty solid Jason torrent right here.

Let me know if that one works for you. If not I'll upload that stuff again. I do have a couple things that aren't in there that I'll post later today. 

Doesn't look like there's any good Tony Millionaire seeds, so yeah, I'll up the first Maakies TPB and some Sock Monkey stuff later today, as well.
