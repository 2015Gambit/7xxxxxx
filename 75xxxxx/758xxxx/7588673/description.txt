Issues 19-20 have been released but I do not yet have scans of them.

Going by the way these books were scanned there is 818 pages, images or files - whichever way you want to look at it is fine. All 818 of these pages have been lovingly and painstakingly 'Restored'. The color in these books is beautiful and deserved to be treated that way. As such, each page was individually 'Leveled' (often making a dramatically positive difference), then checked for Sharpness and Contrast (if the changes made the page look better - they were left, if not - they were removed). Next, all of the b&w pages received the 'Underground' restoration settings. Lastly, every page was re-sized so that it can be clicked two to three times past full-screen within the comic book reader (this is important because many of the pages have a lot of very small text). To me, the difference from old to new is stunning. For you I hope it's unnoticeable. And I hope you enjoy.
