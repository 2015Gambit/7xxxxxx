[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-30T13:47Z,"Enjoy the third episode of the Walking Dead game! :)

This is the 3 episode ONLY so you need the original game to play this! Working perfect with this release:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7401259/The.Walking.Dead.2.Episodes-REVOLT

Just copy the WalkingDead103 folder to your Pack folder where you installed the game.

Seeding with 200mbit/s but please continue seed you too! :)"
,unreadable33,2012-08-30T14:14Z,Thanks so much for the speedy upload. I've been waiting for Ep 3 forever and it's finally here. I will be seeding 8 gigs. Thanks again.
,jayjayusa,2012-08-30T14:50Z,Thanks a lot for this! You're appreciated =)
,eternalsk,2012-08-30T14:58Z,"Registered myself today to say thanks...Fortunately Downloaded your previous torrent, which worked perfectly...Thank you so much to release the torrent so quicky after a day of actual release...Was wasting desperately for this episode..."
,nignug,2012-08-30T14:59Z,Wow this episode was crazy! Gotta hand it to Telltale...not my money of course.....
,unreadable33,2012-08-30T15:19Z,just like eternalsk I registered to show my appreciation. Just finished downloading and everything works great. Like I said earlier I will be seeding 8gigs. All hail Mr.Stifmeister
,ag_orange,2012-08-30T15:29Z,Alright....thanks m8---really like this game! +1
,EmilzTPB,2012-08-30T15:45Z,"thanks man,just current dl speed sucks a bit.."
,EmilzTPB,2012-08-30T17:14Z,Damn menu is laggy as hell. At least game itself is not that much laggy
,Nounread,2012-08-30T17:29Z,"do the save games work from previous chapters?
I know with part 2 some people had to play around with renaming save files (like myself) because it didn't continue the choices people made in part one."
,Dhatz,2012-08-30T17:56Z,"this is a short one, so it would only help if for the duration of you playing this ep you remain seeding no matter how pathetic is your upspeed and don't download any other torrent paralelly so you don't brake it here."
,Greencze,2012-08-30T19:42Z,"Dont lisen to that faggot Mike, this is working. Just tested it, thanks REVOLT."
,Green912,2012-08-30T19:56Z,"What do I have to do for the game to activate the play button on episode 3? I put the WalkingDead103 folder in the pack directory but nothing happens, what do I have to do? Can somebody give me a step-by-step guide please?"
,Green912,2012-08-30T20:11Z,"I cant get this game to work, I placed the WalkingDead103 folder in the pack directory but when i launch the game, it says the Episode 3 is stile ""coming soon"""
,Green912,2012-08-30T20:12Z,"Shit sorry for the 2nd comment, thought the other comment deleted itself or something -.-"
,super_tramp79,2012-08-30T20:13Z,"@MikeTheGreek1994: STFU you whiny prick.

@Mr.Stifmeister: Thank you very much. 

@Everyone else: Although, I just started it seems to be working great so far."
,Kartnisch,2012-08-30T20:36Z,Just got a load of TTARCH files wich i cant do shit with.... Any solution?
,Apozor,2012-08-30T20:37Z,"Dowloaded and finished it.

Works great !

Except for the very end, when you've got the comparison between your choices and those made by the other players. The choices name are generics (ie. ""choice1"" ""choice2""). No big deal.

Thank you Revolt !"
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-30T20:51Z,"@Kartnisch
Just read the first comment.

Im playing this too right now as some other people and it works. So dont know what your problem is MikeTheGreek1994."
,momo4,2012-08-30T20:53Z,does it works on mac with crossover ? do i need the first episode or... ? thanks!
,ag_orange,2012-08-30T22:32Z,It works perfectly...I had already installed with saved files (completed) episode 1 and 2!
,swop557,2012-08-30T23:03Z,work good ...easy instal (only copy) ...old saves work too good .... this is no fake ...if you read 1st coment all work perfect
,nignug,2012-08-31T00:50Z,"@MikeTheGreek1994

If you are too immature to figure out how to get it to work you shouldn't be here in the first place. This comment section is a good place to ask for help. If you are just going to type in all caps like a retard than no one is going to help you."
,tgrphnx,2012-08-31T02:41Z,@MiketheGreek1994: Works great on my rig and was easy to install (copy/paste) NO black screen or anything messed up like that.  I'd like to point out to you that you are posting within 1 day of release... pay attention to things before you post idiot statements.  Aug. 28th was the PSN release ONLY.  Aug. 29th was everyone else.. this includes the PC version that you are commenting on.
,thoma51987,2012-08-31T03:27Z,Argh more seeders pls....
,riverfront12,2012-08-31T04:59Z,"I understand that this works with http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7401259/The.Walking.Dead.2.Episodes-REVOLT this release as the uploader said. But I do have a questions. Does this work with the one uploaded by RELOADED? I have parts 1 and 2 downloaded to RELOADED. If not, is there any way we can work things out here? Thanks in advance peeps."
,riverfront12,2012-08-31T05:02Z,"I forgot if this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7213107/The_Walking_Dead_Episode_1-RELOADED really is the one I downloaded but, will it work with the one uploaded by Mr.Stifmeister?"
,CelloGabe,2012-08-31T06:52Z,"If anyone's having a problem where Episode 3 appears as Coming Soon even after you copied the folder, do the following:
Make sure Ep1's folder is called default, Ep2's called WalkingDead102, and Ep3's called WalkingDead103.
If it still appears as Coming Soon, move away the file called ""0_99_patch_02_05.ttarch"" from the folder. (Do not delete it, in case this fix doesn't work)

PS, if you guys get a black screen and some noises, it's probably because you replaced existing episode files by the new ones. You need to put the files in a new folder, DO NOT APPLY THE FILES AS IF THEY WERE A CRACK."
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-31T08:20Z,"@riverfront12: I have not tried with Reloaded release of the game but it should not be any problem. Try download this and test, and place the walkingdead103 folder in the Pack folder where you installed the game."
,xxdjdjxx,2012-08-31T10:09Z,"Well, this torrent worked fine... after it crashed once and deleted my save files. Oh well, not a big loss I guess... but I suggest backing up your save files before you try to play..."
,dubesor,2012-08-31T10:43Z,"I have a huge problem. The game works and it loads the old saves just fine etc. But when you press Rewind on EPisode 3 to replay everything is bugged and you can't see the scenes. The worst is if you get to the stats screen, I have only the bars for the choices no text, no buttons. Thus you can't leave the screen and have to forcequit the game via taskmanager. Please fix the torrent. "
,riverfront12,2012-08-31T12:47Z,@Mr.Stifmeister: Sure thing man. I will post if it works with the one with RELOADED. Thanks for the upload.
,riverfront12,2012-08-31T13:37Z,Okay folks. It's official. This one works with the one uploaded by RELOADED (parts 1 and 2 of the game). Just copy the walkingdead103 folder to your pack folder where you installed the game. Enjoy!
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-31T14:04Z,"@riverfront12 , Just what i though :)
Have fun playing ! :P"
,ag_orange,2012-08-31T15:49Z,"It works with Reloaded....

@ dubesor I rewinded it and started again episode 3 and it works perfectly....try again!"
[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-31T17:48Z,@ Mr.Stifmeister   Awesome work ! Respect !
,riverfront12,2012-08-31T18:36Z,"@Mr. Stifmeister: What a shame. After a few hours of posting my confirmation message here that this works with reloaded, I finished the game. Damn too fast lol"
,xxela,2012-09-01T15:27Z,"Thanks Mr.Stifmeister ! 
Works flawless but I have one question: why the episodes appear with such a big time intervals between them?"
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-09-01T16:59Z,"@xxela: Well, thats a question i cant answer. Think you need to ask the game creators about that :)"
,AnGaMe,2012-09-01T20:55Z,works like a charm......Thanks uploader.

,PlumBrendan69,2012-09-09T02:43Z,"Thanks, works perfectly"
,vududis,2012-09-11T03:44Z,"I had a lot of problems because I had TWO separate installs from grabbing Ep1 from RELOADED and the Ep1/Ep2 combo from REVOLT. What I finally realized is that I'm not nearly as broke as when Ep1 came out, I've enjoyed these games so far, and they're cheap. So, I'm just going to pony up on Steam. 

FYI, REVOLT created a new install in Program Files (x86) /Games /The Walking Dead, where I was trying to install this to Program Files (x86) /The Walking Dead, which only had Ep1. "
,VBCoder,2012-09-11T20:26Z,Great torrent. Hope there was a combo upload like EP1 & 2
