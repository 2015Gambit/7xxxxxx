TMOM2012 takes another leap into the mind of Mckenna as he explains to us how TimeWaveZero Theory came about, and ruminations about its effects on himself as the discoverer. Poignant, yet uplifting. Enjoy the very wrong soundtrack, voice mastering and mix by Craig DeSousa, the titling and creativity of Azmazz, the codec enhancement by Ernie and the headspace of Schwann as Terence becomes a totality symbol..
