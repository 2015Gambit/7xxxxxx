Requirements: Android 2.2+
Overview: Shady is the most powerful secret messaging application on Android and beats the pants off anything that can be made on Blackberry, or iPhone. It is a contact list, and all messages sent to contacts in the list are only visible within Shady. Unlike the stock messager Shady SMS notifications do not show the content. It is discrete, hidden, SECRET. You can configure the Shady notification message to be anything you'd like, so at 2AM when get a message from Bob's BarBQ there will appear to be nothing Shady going on.
AFTER YOU FIRST OPEN SHADY THERE IS NO ICON, AND THERE IS NO OPEN BUTTON!


Welcome to Shady SMS, where what happens in Shady stays in Shady! Shady is the Android Market's premier secret and completely hidden messaging application.

Features :

* 19 free messager themes
* 25 Free contact list fonts
* 4 Contact list styles
* 4 Animation settings
* 4 Popup header themes
* 12 free custom notification icons

What's in this version:
(Quick Fix) Handle dismissing dialogs gracefully on low end Android phones
Did everyone disable "update notifications" in the Play Store yet? When I need to fix something because Shady is crashing on someone's phone, I will fix it. If an update is needed to fix it, I have to publish the update
For Android 3.0+ devices the messager will now scroll to the bottom when the keyboard is opened for getCount() - 5
Fixed a potential crash condition in the failed sms resend feature
