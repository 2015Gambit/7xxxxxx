Video quality is great for its resolution, but the audio is terrible, it was used a 'lame' AAC codec, wich is very bad on bitrates bellow 96kbps, its so bad its almost like mono, not even stereo! Next time please use a better codec, maybe apple AAC or Nero AAC, both are great on low bitrates. Even OGG (vorbis) is better than 'lame' aac!"
