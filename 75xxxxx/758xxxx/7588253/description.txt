The closest I can get to describing hearing Admiral Sir Cloudesley ShovellΓÇÖs music for the first time is that it was akin to the aural equivalent of stumbling into an 18 year-old maleΓÇÖs bedsit in 1973.
 
Status Quo, Budgie and Black Sabbath albums are piled on top of the hi-fi; torn centrefolds from Playbirds and Whitehouse are Sellotaped to the walls; Richard AllenΓÇÖsSuedehead, William BurroughsΓÇÖ Junkie and Francis KingΓÇÖs Sexuality, Magic & Perversiontumble from the window sill; crushed Courage Light Ale cans and Players No 6 packets form a tower in the corner; filthy, tight-fitting T-shirts and patched-up denim bell bottoms are strewn all over the floor. And there, in the centre, like a Biblical king surveying his domain, is the music lover ΓÇô a stick-thin, back street Jesus, engrossed in the rolling of his last spliff, flowing hair all but obscuring his chops, the opening bars of The GroundhogsΓÇÖ ΓÇÿCherry RedΓÇÖ blowing from the speakers around him like a sucker-punch from Heaven.
 
Get the picture? Good. The Shovell, as their friends and fans know them, belong spiritually to a time and place weΓÇÖd all like to believe still exists somewhere ΓÇô maybe thatΓÇÖs why their no-nonsense take on the progressive metal sound of the early-mid ΓÇÖ70s is so damn accessible. You donΓÇÖt need a degree in doom-rock or a Masters in metal for their incorrigible clatter to strike a (power) chord ΓÇô you just need ears, feet and some appreciation of what makes bands and music GOOD.
 
Some statistics: the Shovell are named after a 17th century English naval commander; Bill Darlington plays drums and is too thin, Louis Comfort-Wiggett plays bass without his glasses falling off and Johnny Gorilla plays guitar and shouts, both loudly; they have been together as a band since 2008 and mates for donkeyΓÇÖs years; their lineage includes more neo-psych, garage, freakbeat and powerpop combos than you could shake a stick at; there are people in Catalunya, Spain still recovering from the ShovellΓÇÖs May 2009 tour there; their 2011 Rise Above 7ΓÇ¥, ΓÇÿReturn To ZeroΓÇÖ/ΓÇÖDay After DayΓÇÖ, sold out instantly and now commands up to ┬ú100 a copy; their debut long-player will tear your face off and put it back on inside out, using spit.
 
OK, so that last bit may be open to conjecture but make no mistake ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt Hear ItΓÇª Fear It! (available on CD and gatefold vinyl with bonus ΓÇ£Euro styleΓÇ¥ 45 ΓÇô oh yes) finds the Hastings threesome delivering the kind of greasy hard-rock thrills rarely heard in this climate of blind nostalgia and misjudged authenticity. ItΓÇÖs hard ΓÇÖnΓÇÖ heavy, without the marshmallow; itΓÇÖs old-fashioned yet so NOW that it hurts; it has three songs on side one and four on side two; it has yer actual Tony McPhee off of the aforementioned Groundhogs on it ΓÇô itΓÇÖs a rock ΓÇÖnΓÇÖ roll album made by people who give two shits and whoΓÇÖve earned just a little ΓÇ£meΓÇ¥ time in the company of your ears. OK?
