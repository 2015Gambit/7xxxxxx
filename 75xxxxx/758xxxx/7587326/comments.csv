,Core.Share,2012-09-03T04:43Z,"Thank you very much MVGroup for caring to document and distribute the 14th Paralympiad Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Paralympics.

It is most appreciated.

Always interest dies away, after the close of the Olympics, once it is time for the Paralympics, that is true for the media, print and broadcast, as it is for the Scene.

However the Olympics and Paralympics are of equivalent magnificence, in reality.

So full marks to MVGroup - Pure Gold.

Please keep up the good work and I look forward to your documentation of the Paralympics Closing Ceremony.

Thank you.

Best regards,"
