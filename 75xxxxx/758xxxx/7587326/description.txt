Information
------------------------------

The eyes of the world are on London for the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Paralympic Games. Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy present live coverage from the Olympic Park, where the Opening Ceremony promises to be an electrifying celebration to mark the occasion when the Paralympic Games, which originated in the UK as the Stoke Mandeville Games in 1948, comes home. The show, titled Enlightenment, promises a spectacular celebration of the inspirational spirit of the Paralympic Games that challenges perceptions of human possibility. The Ceremony opens with a fly past by Aerobility, a British charity that trains disabled people to become pilots, and includes 50 specialist performers that have taken part in an eight-week circus skills training programme; a parade of all competing nations; and the highly anticipated entrance of the Paralympic Flame, which ignites the Cauldron and signals the start of 11 days of elite sporting competition.
