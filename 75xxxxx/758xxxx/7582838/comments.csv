,pdxwill,2012-08-30T04:56Z,@Phoenixx_09... why? Use VLC and you won't have problems playing normal video files...
,bmalmq,2012-08-30T06:01Z,Thanks.
,kiwij,2012-08-30T07:35Z,"THANKS! PS. Phoenixx_09: actually mkv is the best container for video and is newer than mp4 so you can't compare it to 8-track, that doesn't make sense."
,UAofE,2012-08-30T13:23Z,"Idiot_09, MKV is just a container file."
,tmtv_dudestah,2012-08-31T04:07Z,"@Phoenixx_09 

mkv is the best format and is supported by multiple media players, some TV's and even blu ray players.
It is the best video format. mp4 is very primitive in comparison"
