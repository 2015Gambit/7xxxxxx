,saadimad98,2012-08-31T11:14Z,"@vcdman17, Try Removing Daemon Tools As For Temporary. After The Rooting Is Done, Re-Install It. This Is Because Of The File Extensions. And For Support Please, Come Here:- http://forum.technoroles.com/forums/automated-android-root-access-granter.37/"
,vcdman17,2012-08-31T14:07Z,"Appreciate the info, but I'm not really looking for support. I'm not going to try it again. I don't even have Daemon on my PC, I assumed it was built in to this program."

Fortunately there is another tool to unroot it so it didn't become a brick with battery."
