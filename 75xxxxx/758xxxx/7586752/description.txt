It is exactly how it sounds, an instructional video series on how to make biodiesel from used and/or fresh vegetable oil (cooking oils), methanol (simple alcohol) and sodium hydroxide (lye).


Although uncomplicated, it was nice to see the reaction before attempting it. The videos also have some helpful tips and tricks. I enjoyed it, so I hope you will too.


P.S. I apologize in advance for some of the loud cracking and popping noises during some of the videos. They were not of my personal rip jobs... "beggars cannot be choosers".
