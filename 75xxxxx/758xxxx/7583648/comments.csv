,matjoh75,2012-08-30T21:29Z,Is it a good copy?
,CaptPeacock,2012-08-30T22:24Z,"I don't know.  But, I won't be looking at it.  There's no reason this is split up into two parts..."
,BoxTheSuicid3,2012-08-30T22:51Z,i wil; download and let u know
,matjoh75,2012-08-30T22:52Z,"ok, seems like no one is seeding anyway been downloading for over an hour now but still only 56% :("
,realpeoplepirate,2012-08-30T23:01Z,"Cheerz Hack, excellent as I'v come to exept and greatly appreciate.
CaptPeacock either you do not realise that you can put 2 (!) files in a ""playlist"" in your media player and it will take you about 6 seconds....and in this case your simply a moron. Orrrr you do know this and you are complaing about YOU having to take 6secs to view a files that prob took Hackulus hours to encode of HIS time to present it to you FREE and without any recompense themselves.....in which case your an ignorant cunt :P
Or your just a troll....in which case I'll stop feedin u :p
Real people pirate....assholes come online and bitch at them ;)"

,naomidobrev,2012-08-30T23:20Z,It seems to me like it's a good copy !
,MyKrossini,2012-08-30T23:46Z,GREAT QUALITY. Who cares if it's split in two? Not me. It's free. Deal with it. A/V 9/9 Thanks Hackulus!
,MyKrossini,2012-08-30T23:47Z,"@ PyRoX1... Father's day is in June, buddy. "
,libertaswv,2012-08-31T00:06Z,"Who cares if it's 2 files? If you're watching on a computer it takes about a second to start the 2nd, and if you're burning to a disc you can either put it on 2 discs or use whatever (i use covertX) to put the files on one disc, encoding them to play back2back automatically. 

Thx for the up, Hackulus - and thx to all s/l's. Sincerely appreciated. Will seed."

,pokeshaw,2012-08-31T00:37Z,"Good movie, worth watching!

,J3rryKo42O,2012-08-31T00:46Z,"@captpeacock 

Because having two files is SUCH a hassle right? 

Go fuck yourself... or buy it at a store and upload it yourself so people can bitch about how you did something solely for other peoples enjoyment. 

Ignorant dumb ass"

,abdep,2012-08-31T01:53Z,"I think y'all are taking the Cap'n a little too seriously...is it not okay for him to express his opinion that he's not interested in the torrent? Some people (like myself) like to archive files to a server and later stream them, often I download files and don't even watch them until I have company over and get a request...yes it's not a big deal but guess what there are a lot of scene releases on the internet, things like this are typically a deal breaker for me; if there's a better release available, then wouldn't I be remiss not to download the better file? Two cd's might be an indicator that the uploader is a novice, foreshadow errors in the media file, or lead me to think that the quality might be lower than otherwise hoped for. I DIDN'T SAY ANY OF THAT WAS APPLICABLE, I relate it to skimming a book for the important details. Further, it's not like he bitched and moaned, all he said was it wasn't for him. For some of you to attack him and call him ignorant is in itself ignorant, freedom of speech assholes. K I'm off the soapbox, thanks for the torrent hackulus"
,abdep,2012-08-31T01:56Z,That was directed at J3rryKo420 and realpeoplepirate
,oak415,2012-08-31T01:56Z,Yep this movie is split in 2 CD files. Which was exactly what I was looking for. For some reason certain DivX capable DVD players start choking when reading single files greater than 700 MB. It would be a hassle for me to upgrade my mom and grandma's DVD players to media players since they still watch DVD's and plus one more thing for them to learn would be a pain for them
,n0bl3h0bO,2012-08-31T02:13Z,"I'm sure it's great, thank you Hackulus! :)"

,deaderweterdog,2012-08-31T02:27Z,first off thanks to the uploader and second to all of you stupid cunts bitching at someone for looking for a torent that more matches what he wants fuck you every time i find something on TPB i look around for the one i want weather im looking for a skull rather than an anon or a file sise that i like better go fuck yourselves torent nazies and again thaks for the upload hackulus

,killCaseyAnthony,2012-08-31T03:05Z,"quit bitching about 2 files. Get convert x to dvd. I watch everything on a 50"" and no matter what size it is, after it is converted it looks perfect. With Convert X To DVD it is easy as shit to put them together. When you watch it after it is converted it is flawless you cant even tell where it was ""spliced"" together"
,abdep,2012-08-31T03:46Z,"Who's bitching about 2 files? Dude commented it was in 2, it's simple information, not a critique (even if it was inferred), the only people I hear bitching are the people jumping over him (and now me). I bet y'all were the type of kids who only act tough when they're with their crew.

Deaderweterdog of anyone here, you most resemble a nazi (or at least a fascist). From the sound of it you need therapy too, way too much anger over an internet forum, you're gonna hurt someone someday if you've got that much pent up aggression waiting to explode."
,s0rds,2012-08-31T03:58Z,"screw the dvd-r  Get a western digital movie player or something similar, the're $70-90.  Then you can either stream to it, connect an external hard drive to it or just upload a movie to a thumb drive in 1-2 minutes and watch it from that.  Got tired of 30-45 dvd burning times and having ghetto looking discs"
,pcrat54,2012-08-31T04:28Z,"I have a pc media center. having 2 files is nothing. if the very worst, the movie stops. AND GOD FORBID YOU LIFT A FINGER TO CLICK PLAY ON THE NEXT FILE. lazy ass's.  
Stop complaining, if its too much for you , then wait for the movie to come out on disc. 
damn fucking whine ass's and ya wonder why everyones getting so fucking fat. they dont want to click play twice if they dont have to. they dont want to get off the couch to get a pop because walking 12 feet is too much work.. boo hoo sux 2 b u."
,cj82,2012-08-31T04:50Z,"Sooooo, lots of bitching- but what about the ratings?"

,realpeoplepirate,2012-08-31T08:25Z,Well u know wat abdep freedom of speech cuts both ways. I'm free to say he's an ignorant cunt for complain at someone trying to help him. Your free to say I'm an asshole (which I know you did not). Your thinly veiled insults do not detract from the fact that YOU are now a cunt for sticking up for an an asshole :P Gr8 movie btw Not best writing in the world but the cgi is good enough in this file size imho Oh yeah and if you want to DL faster then just make sure your upload speed is set high or all the seeds in the world wont help ;)

,mcrowley,2012-08-31T09:17Z,"Thanks Hackulus! 
I really don't understand why the separate files are such a big deal in a movie like this.  For myself the chances are I'll just stare at Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron like a brain damaged geek for about an hour and a half and never watch it again.  If it turns out to be a half decent movie I'll either re-download it in a higher resolution or merge the files.  As far as slow downloads go, either have a little patience, fucking seed or get a direct download from MU/RS or any number of other file servers."

,spifkitten99,2012-08-31T10:40Z,"Instead of telling people to stop bitching about it being 2 files, then stfu and accept that people don't want to fucking files, and it's retarded to have to spend time joining them.

There is no good reason to make it 2 files. If anyone still uses CD's, then they need to move on."

,DarkFen,2012-08-31T23:12Z,"So it seems to me that people are fairly ungrateful and extremely immature. Cyberbashing should be a banning offense.

not a bad movie. good acting, decent storyline, plot was a little forced and lacking substance and depth. even though it's over 2 hrs long, some parts feel too rushed. obviously derivative of LOTR elements and direction. no urge to watch it again soon. suggest watching it once to see how you feel about it. might be more fun in a group setting."

Anyways
The only issue i had with this version (haven't tried others though) was that i had to keep adjusting the volume.  It would be super loud in the action sequences but then everyone in the movie would start whispering... and with accents at that.. so we couldn't tell what they were saying.  So we'd turn the volume up.. then WHAM.. another action scene

BR rips must be intended for 5.1 home theater systems, because as one poster stated, on a simple subwoofer / dual tweeter setup, the action scenes sound like explosions, yet the talking scenes are barely audible.  Had to crank the volume all the way up on my powered speakers just to hear the conversations. This is very frustrating for box dwellers who needs to appease their neighbors by keeping the sound low.  Are there better ways to rip the audio to retain an acceptable volume balance between vocals and action?"
