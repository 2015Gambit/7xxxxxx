Requirements: Android OS v1.6+
Overview: Block app Permissions!



This is the Pro version of Permission Denied. At this time, this version detects more applications, allows you to see all applications with a specific permission, a ui upgrade, of sorts, and handles rejecting permissions better than the free version.

This application does not work on all devices, you will need to just try it out and see if it works for your device. Try the free version before you buy the pro version!

This app Requires Root Access!

Permissions allows you to effectively control the permissions that apps which are installed onto your phone, via the market or some other source.

You must reboot before these changes take place and be aware that denying an app a permission that it is requesting may result in the app Force Closing.
