[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-31T20:13Z,"Update v1.5 which is only 181mb in size changes a lot of files of the main game , so SKIDROW took the easy road and just cracked the files after they have been updated.

This is perfect release will fix a lot of issues.

,shauwy,2012-08-31T20:55Z,so it's the full game or just the update???
,boyznacne,2012-08-31T20:59Z,"@Froztiez 

READ THE FUCKING COMMENT ABOVE YOU DOOFUS!

""Update v1.5 which is only 181mb in size changes a lot of files of the main game , so SKIDROW took the easy road and just cracked the files after they have been updated.""

Use the process of deduction and comprehend what that means!"
,nickwafu,2012-08-31T21:07Z,"so, to cut the story short, this torrent is a new game installer but patched from 1.5 version. am i right??? answer me guy please"
,airbenderrr,2012-08-31T21:44Z,Can anyone tell me if this fixes the issue of the game not starting when your windows is on a different drive?

,sobo100,2012-08-31T22:50Z,"This is Steam and SquareEnix’s effort to stop piracy
steam now patches original files instead of downloading it again
so 125MB update data split on all game files=7GB new files
no way to overcome this unless someone figures how to repack game files with the new data, 180mb updated files like 6gb so faster but no better for us is to send new files then file bat who will rebiuld for us this files… so nothing is perfect"
[T],tikasukaz,2012-09-01T03:50Z,Do not forget to INSTALL STEAM and run your game as administrator

,simolino,2012-09-05T20:34Z,"Hey tikasukaz, can I ask you why we would have to install steam? Isn't that what what were trying to avoid in the first place? I mean, that doesn't make any fucking sense, the game is on here for the reason of circumventing steam, and now we have to have it installed? bullshit, SKIDROW wouldn't do that shit...How come HeroMaster's upload mentions nothing of installing steam!!!"
,thcfreak666,2012-09-05T22:25Z,"This patch does nothing, the game is still unplayable with gtx570. Big Fail Developers !"

,SkelterHelter69,2012-09-06T14:05Z,"@mmaxt that error used to come up for me too, it seems it does it with every update. I tried downloading the binkw32.dll and putting it in the main directory where it is supposed to be, but that just made the game crash at the main menu.

Reinstalling the game worked for me...you can try that if you want."
