Said gazillion times, but worth repeating:

"For ones with/in doubts, "inner" questions and voyeur tendencies:

Get proper, good torrent-program
with MediaInfo plug-in, NFO viewer plug-in
and STOP asking for things already present.
Or get hell out of my torrents and choose ones you need.

So - here is no waste of dozens KB in page content just to
repeat content of NFO file.

It is not needed anymore.
It's archaic and obsolete.
Doing right-click in your torrent client is easier:

"Requests must contain IMDB link. Request must contain valid reason Why do you ask for it and do not go someplace else.
Re-seed requests must contain link to specific torrent.
Any type of Requests should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
Re-seed request should contain exact time and time-zone you're in. Google. My Time Zone is CET, so do the math before.
Re-seed time-window is 1 day. If you have slow connection meaning, you cannot finish download in that time-frame, just forget about re-seeding and especially loading of old, dead torrents.
Re-seed chances are good for single torrents within one year of original day of upload.
Chances for re-seed of Pack-torrents and single TV episodes are slim to none.
In short - if I have something (and is physically present) - I would definitely re-seed.
You should just ask - nicely, in civilized and aforementioned manner, of course.
If you've done something wrong on my torrents - ever - do not bother to ask.

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my uploads; that's my call. The removal of some show and movies (both from consideration and seeding) depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs or evil or stupid comments. These decisions are my own."


NOTE: Before making fool of yourself (as lately many did) click  on "Files" (up there, not hidden)  and look what is in the torrent. If you want to see NFO or screen-shots - they are in the torrent. So, either get torrent program or plug-in for one you use with IMG and NFO viewer or - download .jpg and .nfo first and knock yourself out.

OLD or DEAD torrents:

Follow my rules to make nice and proper Re-seed Request, as explained above.
In case of old torrents, trackers might be dead by now - then simply load one new torrent of mine and from Properties of that new torrent copy and then paste all trackers in Properties of old torrent.
