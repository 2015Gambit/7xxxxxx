The immensely popular NERVO twins Mim and Liv team up with Hook N Sling to deliver what will definitely be one of the biggest tracks of this year. 'Reason' is a very impressive effort from the three Australian producers and is the perfect feel-good summer anthem. NERVO's killer vocals float over a gorgeous build up that is followed up by an energetic drop that packs loads of impact! A must have for your summer festival sets.
