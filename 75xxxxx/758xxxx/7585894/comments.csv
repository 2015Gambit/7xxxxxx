,MrDerrrp,2012-09-01T18:52Z,"A/V 8/10

Such a shitty movie, the only thing brutal about this movie was the acting, story, cinematography, etc..
if i could speak to the creator i would beg him to change careers"

Saves my looking fo it myself :-)

Which more people would provide it in the details part, I know many do.

Just my thoughts, and yes I am not too lazy to look myself, it is just better customer service to have a link I believe."
