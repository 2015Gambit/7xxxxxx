,imyoungxp,2012-08-31T17:05Z,"Doesn't work on my Infinity. I downloaded the 10 files, unzipped, changed main.4.com.Phosphor.Horn.Paid.obb to main.4.com.Phosphor.Horn.Paid.rar, extracted files to com.Phosphor.Horn.Paid, copied to android/obb, installed APK, open APK, black screen, crash.
Also tried lucky patcher, black screen, crash. Any help?"
,imyoungxp,2012-08-31T19:32Z,Nvm it works fine now... i opened the wrong rar for extraction.
,CossakUA,2012-09-01T16:11Z,"Can anyone help me how to install this game? I have a google nexus 7. I am new in android, so don,t really know how to do it. I've triwd installing it and unpacking the files, but it doesn't work. Please help!"
,aklesh3,2012-09-02T14:13Z,When I go to use the links in the SD Files.txt they are no longer any good. Where do we get them now?
,j122068,2012-09-05T17:41Z,I have tried to find the SD files on many many different sites. I have Googled the words horn sd too many times. The links in this torrent and the other torrents for horn SD are broken. Can someone please upload horn SD files to thepiratebay.
,j122068,2012-09-06T07:13Z,It looks like the SD files that are broke up into 10 parts may still work I am only on the second file. When I first tried the smaller files they kept failing but I think it was just my internet cause the first two file links are working now.
,j122068,2012-09-07T19:41Z,"I did get the sd files broke up into 10 parts to work.

I had to install unrar pro because it supports multi unraring. you just install apk, DL all 10 files, open unrar pro and select the first rar file and extract it, then copy the extracted file into the android/obb folder. Then launck the game

 while the files were DL if i were to surf the web the files would fail to DL.  after i installed and launched the game the screen was black and I could hear the music. I did a restart and it worked fine. after a while the game said could not find licence and failed so i turned wifi off and it worked fine. This was all done with my transformer prime tf201"
