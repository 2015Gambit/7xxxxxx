BBC Proms 2012 - 46. Vaughan Williams Night

Vaughan Williams - Symphony No. 5 in D major (39 mins)
Vaughan Williams - Symphony No. 6 in E minor (31 mins)

BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra
Andrew Manze conductor

Over the next few seasons Andrew Manze directs all nine Vaughan Williams symphonies with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, of which he is Associate Guest Conductor: `Vaughan Williams is one of those composers some people have fixed ideas about . I'm on a bit of a mission to rehabilitate him in people's minds as an important figure in the musicmaking of this country.'

Tonight he tackles three differently powerful works of the 1930s and 1940s, which, whatever their own emotional back stories, may still be seen as chronicling our national life in troubled times.
