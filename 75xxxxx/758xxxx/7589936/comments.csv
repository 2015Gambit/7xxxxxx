[T],trialNerror,2012-09-01T21:18Z,"so i recorded this for nothing? wonderful.

you could've saved yourself 2.5gb if you had just waited a couple hours longer.  i know you have very limited data transfer...

and just a heads up if i don't get something the night it aired it's because something else was on of more interest and i'll get that other show when it repeats.

if a full week goes by and it's still not posted, then you can go get another source."
[V],psspss,2012-09-01T22:00Z,"you didnt answer in other torrent
so didnt know if had it

you do mp4 anyhow"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-02T00:19Z,"Okay fine I'll answer you from now on. But still, now you know, wait a few days for a release if it's not available pronto. I know you despise mp4, but you could've only downloaded 170mb for this episode instead of 2.5gb...

So, how about this, I can't get this show on Wednesday nights because I'm recording stuff on other channels when this airs (even during the repeat 3 hrs later I'm recording something else on another channel), but will get the next repeat of Toy Hunter on Saturday if CRiM' doesn't get it.  Deal?

Oh hey that Professor Weird show you mentioned... funny thing is I DID have it, but watched it and it was pretty stinking lame. The old man covered 2 cases that have already been done to death so that's why I deleted it without releasing it.  I didn't see your query for it until after it was deleted. Sorry? The only good part of the show was his cutey college girl assistant bending over in a skirt to see if the road was level.  If I ever see it re-airing I'll get it again and release it just for the weird super-low budget TV show lovers.  "
[V],psspss,2012-09-02T04:36Z,"the source showed up prob 3 hours after I asked

some crazy dude uploading 1080i 2.5g for a 20min show

however hes the only only uploading some missing content.. so we have no choose but to use his at times"
[V],psspss,2012-09-02T04:37Z,"toy hunters is having a break for a few weeks now
so repeats prob will be on wednesdays no doubt"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-02T18:32Z,"You still don't get it do you? Ugh. No wonder I hate trying to talk to you; it's like trying to talk to a brick wall.

You could have waited just a little bit longer and saved yourself a TON of data transferred. 

170mb mp4 or 2.5gb mpg ... hmm, 170mb mp4 would've been easier on your monthly transfer cap. I guess no matter how many times I say it you won't get it or acknowledge it.

This isn't even that great of a show. Just another one of those dumb ones about buying old stuff at a crazy price then turning it around to sell it for an insane price. Very low on priority list for me. If you don't see me upload another episode it's because I just don't like the show. I tend to only do that which I like. Anything else is a waste of time and bandwidth.

By the way, congratulations on making top 100 TPB uploaders.  Don't get too excited, tho', it's not for best torrents; its for amount of torrents.  No wonder you go over your limit. You're totally wasting time and bandwidth on so many (dumb) shows and A LOT of what you do there's AFG xvids. So what if the file size is 350~420mb for a 1hr (~42 min) show? That's because they do the more quality maintained 1-pass CQ encoding opposed to your quality LOST 1-pass CBR encodes.

Remember I'm not your buddy, not your friend, not your pal, not your source for requests. You always have and always will be that annoying putz in the torrent world that only does half ass encodes and would have nothing to encode if it weren't for other people putting something on a site. You would have nothing without everyone else. I'm just that guy that gives out shows I like in mp4 format so you can leech them (I know you don't seed back what you download from me), scoff at them, and convert to xvid for that small crowd of nitwits stuck in time.  Your 200 downloaders for a popular scripted show aint a thing when the scene mp4 already had 20000.  See? Very small crowd. It's their problem they don't realize there are TV Media Players are out there which play almost ALL formats (avi, mp4, mkv, mov, rm, flv, etc) for such an affordable price - possibly the same price or less than that ""old gear"" from 10 years ago.  And why you don't help educate people about this is beyond me. You're hindering their technological advancement to enjoy future releases of entertainment. Shame on you."
[V],psspss,2012-09-03T02:34Z,"true its a little dumb and yes I get it.. I wanted to see this one as title was misleading.. I thought perhaps he found a million dollar item that someone didnt know

but alas it was kinda of boring
collection invention is heading the same way
but prob a little more interesting then this show

people waited 3 days already and no word from you

its amazing though.. how many people download dumb shows like this.. when they dont download
all the great documentaries i share instead
and could learn something and see the lies corruption and coverups happening all around them

such as my recent UFO bundle.. 2 great docus in it
one should watch.. the age of mankind and the
russia space race conspiracy"
[V],psspss,2012-09-03T02:38Z,"im actually cutting back.. I prob be at the bottom uploaders in a months time.. as I said I focus on paranormal and ufos stuff more again and less reality
but was a few shows I wanted to finish off

it seems the rippers dont upload their own stuff to p2p and let people like me find them and take the risk sharing huh..

I just want lower quality xvids.. 1) it shouldnt upset the tv coys at all .. not like mp4s and iso
rips should as people will want to buy better anyhow if they are a fan
2) xvids plays on older gear and is less hassle
cos of that"
[V],psspss,2012-09-03T02:45Z,"i do like the gold docu reality shows though so I need xvids of them if afg dont do them I have to convert
and must admit i like some shows like storage wars
as its something you can learn from and laugh at 
pawn stars is another"
[V],psspss,2012-09-03T03:14Z,"I just had a read of this.. and none of the ip locates I use.. I dont upload from usa or fr LOL

its total BS .. its almost made up to scare people

the other thing.. theres a big difference from uploading stuff to actually ripping it from a tv stream
its seems they are merging the 2

,baconninja,2012-09-03T13:20Z,Thanks! I like this show. Very nostalgic.
