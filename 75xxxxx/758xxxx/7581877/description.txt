Storyline
Natobar, like any other typical Bengali lad, wants to be a poet. He is unsuccessful in all his attempts while dabbling with poetry. Rabindranath Tagore visits him in his sleep and gives him a boon - he is endowed with Tagore's poetic prowess but for a limited period. Armed with this, Natobar ventures out to win the world. He pens down two volumes of poems composed on the next door girl, Mishtu, whom he adores but finds it difficult to get them published! Heartbroken, he joins the world of advertising where he becomes an instant hit as a jingle writer. He falls into the trap of upward mobility & undergoes a value change! Eventually, Natobar returns to his roots....
