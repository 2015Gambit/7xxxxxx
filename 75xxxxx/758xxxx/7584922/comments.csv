,vet3shaws,2012-08-31T06:52Z,"After launching the video, it pop-ups a codec download request of gyganinstall_0775.exe  which I do not trust."
,Hober_Mallow,2012-08-31T09:47Z,"@vet3shaws  No pop-ups for me... It played fine, sounds like something got hooked on your video player"
,BoonesFerry,2012-09-03T07:52Z,@vet3shaws-- sounds like you have a trojan/virus. There is NO such thing coming from this video file.
