These are the final three fifles of Falling Skies from the second season. This is one of the best rated Sci-Fi shows to come out in quite a while in my opinion, and I should know, 'cuz I've been watching scifi since thge mid-50s...every saturday afternoon faithfully we'd hit the matinees depending on who was showing the best.
Ahhh memories.. and it was only fifteen cents to get in, and that included a free box oftoo@ however, they *did* boost the price of drinks on those days..and its tough eatingwithout a dring. :-)  Anyhow, enjoy these.. it'll make you wish the next seasob would start as soon as possible.
