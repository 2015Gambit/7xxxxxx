Review from Orlando Weekly:

Orlando singer Ashley Dudukovich is many things on her band Chasing Jonah's debut EP: heart-shattered, afraid of love and "walking down Mills Avenue" after some car trouble, "where early sunset leapt off and took flight." One thing she's not is a dummy. Although her front-and-center, delicately lilting voice rises and falls with seemingly every painful memory a lyric digs up ΓÇô an undeniably voyeuristic pleasure ΓÇô Chasing Jonah's tracks start slow, build to crescendos capably managed by her backing band and only realize their fullness at the peak pop moment, making this effort a demo sure to perk up the ears of the lovesick and licensing scouts alike.
