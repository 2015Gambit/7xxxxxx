You might want to try and get some of the other Lovecraft torrents because they contain audio productions of some of his works and a delight to listen to. While I prefer my volumes in pdf format, because of the ereaders it is important to get works out in epub and mobi format now, too. Again, thanks for the addition!!!"

You're right, this one is not unusual, but I liked the way it was arranged and I don't like the audio books, I prefer to read. I have an old PC just for the purpose, with a B/W monitor so it is not so hard on my eyes and offers perfect contrast. There I have my digital library of about 8,000 selected books in pdf, doc or htm formats.
