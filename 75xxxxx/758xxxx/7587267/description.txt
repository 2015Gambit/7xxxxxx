While the memory might fade, the fact is that some things never change. Truly haunting and powerfully crafted, Summer of Firefly Memories by newcomer Joan Gable rekindles the soul and ignites the passion of hope and longing. Fiercely independent, eco-journalist Samantha McGreggor has exposed some of the twenty-first centuryΓÇÖs most alarming environmental enemies and calamities, but lately she has felt uninspired, disillusioned, and nearly apathetic. In hopes of getting her life back on track and awakening her old enthusiasm, she sets off for a summer retreat at the rustic lake resort she hasnΓÇÖt visited since her parentsΓÇÖ deaths over twenty years ago. In a formidable, thoughtful, lively prose, the author examines the strength of a familyΓÇÖs love and the power of their memory.
