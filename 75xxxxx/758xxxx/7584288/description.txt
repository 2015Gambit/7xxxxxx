============================================
Description:                               =
============================================

They Bleed Pixels is a fiendishly difficult action platformer inspired by H.P
 Lovecraft and classic horror. Rendered in a distinct visual style that blends
 pixel art with paper and ink textures, They Bleed Pixels is a singular mix of
 intense platforming and fierce beat-em-up action. At the core of its fighting
 system is a simple one-button combat scheme with surprising depth and
 versatility. Button mashing is discouraged while kicking shadowy monsters into
 saws, pits and spikes is rewarded, thanks to a unique system that lets you
 earn and place your own checkpoints through stylish kills. The fancier your
 kills, the faster you fill the checkpoint meter
