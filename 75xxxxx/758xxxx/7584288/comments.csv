,Spooky_Squid_Games,2012-09-01T06:39Z,"Hey pirate folks! This is Miguel and Andrij, the two developers for They Bleed Pixels. Can't really say we're super surprised to see this up on the Pirate Bay ;)

So here's the deal. We know a certain number of folks will choose to pirate the game, you may be a broke student, have no credit card, want to try before you buy etc...  I'll be honest, we aren't super happy you're getting the game this way but we do hope you enjoy it regardless!  We worked hard and sacrifice a lot to make They Bleed Pixels over the last two years. We're pretty proud of it and we want people to have fun playing it.

So if you play it and find you like it (or love it!) we'd be really happy if you supported our little two person team by buying a copy for yourself, or gifting one or more to friends on Steam.  Your financial support means we'll be able to make you more awesome games.
"

,Azex88,2012-09-01T19:17Z,"Game didnt run after installing so i guess om gonna buy it, Specially since the devs asked so nicely. Its on special on steam atm anywway"

Hey, that's mighty civilized of you :) I am neither broke nor without credit card, so I will buy it if I like it. I appreciate you being all chummy about it!"
,pirralho3,2012-09-04T01:15Z,"Ill play it, if I like it i'll surely buy it on steam"
,dilinwe,2012-09-04T02:29Z,"i buy it yesterday in steam and when i run the main exe i get ""theybleedpixels has stopped working"", whats the matter??"
,Spooky_Squid_Games,2012-09-04T20:20Z,"Thanks to those of you who've bought the game so far.  We really appreciate it!  Again if you haven't paid for it and enjoyed it please buy a copy for yourself or a friend.  Like I said before, your financial support for the game helps us continue making great games.

dilinwe if you bought it on Steam there is a forum you have access to where you can get support for your issue running it."
,CaptExpendable,2012-09-05T01:50Z,"@Spooky_Squid_Games
I was actually going to give even the torrent a pass until I saw your comment. Ten bucks is cheap! A thought: You could upload the game yourself, put a link to its steam page, or a paypal donate, or something like that."
,dilinwe,2012-09-06T03:13Z,unfortunetly they say thats my video card is not supported (nvidia geforce 310m & intel hd 3000)
,Kenji99,2012-09-08T12:16Z,"@ Spooky_Squid_Games:

Thats awesome you guys came on here, Im gonna buy the game now :)"
,ExzoSSG,2012-09-11T08:45Z,"I think that's pretty awesome of the devs to write a comment and I now feel bad about pirating this. I'm going to try it out for a bit and if it's something I like I'm going to buy it. 

I think more devs should do this although I know some people just don't care and pirate just to pirate but it gets some people to support the devs who make good games. "
,B3winged,2012-09-11T10:49Z,"@ Spooky_Squid_Games:
Hey guys, you're awesome! If I end up liking this game I'll buy it the second I manage to get a job! It's great that you're active like this, reminding people to buy the game. I hope your game does really well! I was looking around for a demo of this but wasn't able to find one, if there is I would love to know as it would allow me to try out the game without pirating it."
,EIias,2012-09-12T19:47Z,Thank you.
,JunkyVirus,2012-09-13T05:57Z,"@ Spooky_Squid_Games:

I'm really sorry for doing this, I promise I will but the game, I just don't have any money left this month, seriously 300 swedish kronor which is about 45 dollars :P 
But I love what I've seen of the game and I'll buy it as soon as I get my paycheck :)  "
,JunkyVirus,2012-09-13T06:49Z,"Just played the prologue and it's awesome, fuck it, I'm getting it now ! *takes money from mommy*  ;) "
,fuaA,2012-09-13T11:08Z,Reddit sent me here 
,vanderseks,2012-09-13T19:14Z,"@Spooky_Squid_Games

Just bought the game off steam, i wasnt sure i'd like it. But make a pirate-version, not with limitations because then nobody will download it, but with some stuff that makes it easy to see that its not the real copy."
,Frodiziak,2012-09-14T01:27Z,"Wth with the lazy coding???

The game has an insane system req for a low fidelity graphics. I have an old graphic card (geforce 7600gt) I can still run mass effect 2 no problem but apparently my graphical card is not suited for this game.

It won't start and I can't seem to fix it. Beware before buying this game this shit is lazy."
,roman0,2012-09-14T09:49Z,"@Spooky_Squid_Games

Make a Linux version, and I'll buy it in a hearbeat. And no, I haven't pirated it, I don't pirate good games."
