This one comes courtesy of Demonoid.  I have a bunch of torrent files from the Noid that I never used because I didn't have the disc space.  Luckily, some are still alive, and I will be slowly upping them to TPB.

I don't know anything about the quality, but it looks pretty good.  The file is 700 MB, but the length is only an hour, so it should be fine.  This is NOT a DVD rip.  It was taped off the TV.

Demonoid will be sorely missed.  Let's all do our best to keep this torrent alive for as long as we can.  Let's show those corporate bastards in Hollywood that you can't kill the Hydra!

Demonoid R.I.P.
Long Live TPB!
