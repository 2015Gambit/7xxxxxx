,ginnyboyd,2012-08-30T00:31Z,question is this from the dvd or movie cam i just started to use this program and have no clue what all the little symbols mean or anything
,BUTT_SEX,2012-08-30T03:57Z,Anyone else having problems with the audio? All the speech has been almost completely muted since the score is drowning it out. Never had this problem with a video file before. I've tried using this file on multiple players too!
,BUTT_SEX,2012-08-30T04:07Z,Well I've tried everything and the audio seems to be all messed up. :(
