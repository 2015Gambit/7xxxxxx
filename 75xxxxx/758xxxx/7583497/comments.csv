Shutdown [/i | /l | /s | /r | /g | /a | /p | /h | /e] [/f] [/m \computer] [/t xxx][/d [p|u:]xx:yy [/c ""comment""]]

/s         Shutdown the computer.

/t xxx     Set the time-out period before shutdown to xxx seconds. The valid range is 0-315360000 (10 years), with a default of 30. If the timeout period is greater than 0, the /f parameter is implied.
