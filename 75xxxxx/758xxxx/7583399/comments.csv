,RegularDude,2012-08-31T04:15Z,"hey i have the game and i download it the episode i just dont know how to install it, made a folder inside the game called thewalkingdead103 and placed files there but , did not work, help would be appreciated"
,ColdCon,2012-08-31T09:14Z,@RegularDude is you have a virtual drive emulator then you can mount the iso then run the set up then place the crack in the folder of the game or if you can burn it to a dvd disc or disc with alota space you can  do it that way

,Nag1ka,2012-09-03T06:44Z,"Quick question,

I downloaded each episode as they came out, always the reloaded version. Each time i installed the game it made a new shortcut on the desktop.

All 3 shortcuts have the same pathway, but the first one only allows the first episode to the be played, second allows first two, third allows all 3.

However when i open the most recent shortcut, the previous game files are not present. I don't really want to re-play the previous epsiodes, is there a way around this?"

I hope it is working fine. 
OR ELSE.
