Now remastered for Android tablets, Uplink plays brilliantly on the mobile format. The touch screen interface elegantly replaces the mouse and all of the original tense and paranoid gameplay is bought straight up to date with this new portable version. Stay mobile, trust nobody, don't get caught.

You're an Uplink Agent - a freelance computer hacker who makes a living by performing jobs for major corporations. Break into classified computer systems, steal research data, sabotage software, change academic and criminal records, even frame innocent people. Just be sure to cover your tracks, and remember that trust is a weakness.
