by dinosaur neo-nazis and judeophobic holocaust deniers 

as an eminent scientist who proved that there never were 

gas chambers to kill humans in the nazi concentration camps, 

defending the inept and infamous Leuchter report that was also 

used to try to convert people to such views.


But who was really this scarecrow those screwballs set up 

to refute the enormous mass of evidence that the nazi did
 
use such means of extermination?


Read from REAL scientists and other sources what kind of 

people neo-nazis use in their pathetic attempts to gain 

respectability.



I can only seed for a short while, please keep it alive by 

seeding. Thanks.
