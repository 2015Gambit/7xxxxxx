At the end of World War 2, an astonishingly simple, self-running machine was discovered in a basement in Germany. It was made from an ordinary automotive generator with a few modifications. Now, the method of operation of this machine has been revealed. This product contains the full, illustrated lecture given by Dr. Lindemann at the Renaissance Conference in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in November of 2010. It explains the physics of operating ordinary electric motors with reduced Back EMF and the method to produce a fully self-running motor-generator combination using "off-the-shelf" components.
