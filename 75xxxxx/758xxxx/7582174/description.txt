If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: Android 4.0 and up
Overview: COMPATIBLE WITH ALL GALAXY NEXUS VARIANTS (as long as its sporting 4.0.3 or 4.0.4) AND NOW IT SUPPORTS THE HTC ONE X (international version with the Tegra 3 only).


franco.Kernel updater app features:
HTC One X:
* Downloads boot.img and modules directly from the FTP
* CPU tools with the ability to change governor parameters and mess with the default governor and CPU frequencies
* Full control over the 4 cores - you can chose how many cores you want your device to use
* Live watch over the 4 cores by the second - you can see the device turning on/off the cores live


What's in this version:
6.2:
Galaxy Nexus:
* Color Control interfaces completely redesigned from scratch - now color multipliers and RGB gamma are much more easy to use. This changes are in preparation for the soon to be available color profiles system (which will much look alike the kernel backup system but for color stuff). You need to re-set the colors after this update or they won't persist on reboot what-so-ever. If you find any bug please post in the XDA kernel thread or email me before leaving 1 star ratings.
