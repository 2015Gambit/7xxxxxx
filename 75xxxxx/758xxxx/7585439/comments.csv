The premise is simple. Take one small Canadian town, remove the women, and see if the men can keep the home fires burning - without burning the kids' dinner. This season, the women of Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia - a picturesque Maritime village with a population of approximately 700 - disappear for one week, leaving the men to fend for themselves and their families.
