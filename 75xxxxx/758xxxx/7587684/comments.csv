The entire official GD.net merchandise debacle has turned into such a complete cluster-fuck with people's orders not being shipped/filled, or folks receiving cracked discs and banged up boxes, and customer support being unforgivably clueless positively useless, I'm supremely grateful that someone has stepped up and provided this offering, especially in a lossless format :D
Thank you so much!!!!"
