The Walking Dead is a five-part game series set in
 the same universe as Robert Kirkman's award-winning
 comic book series. Play as Lee Everett, a convicted
 criminal, who has been given a second chance
 at life in a world devastated by the undead.
 With corpses returning to life and survivors
 stopping at nothing to maintain their own safety,
 protecting an orphaned girl named Clementine may
 offer him redemption in a world gone to hell.
