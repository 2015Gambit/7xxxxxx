,that-dork-mandy,2012-09-01T05:44Z,It didn't work with my iPod Touch. Is there a way to make it work?
,neophunk,2012-09-01T19:51Z,It's either iPhone OR iPad. Both is not possible with this game. So what is it?
,slummylord,2012-09-02T22:28Z,ipad version. doesnt work with ipod
,NSMXIII,2012-09-05T03:59Z,"This is the iPhone version of the game. It will only work on an iPhone 4/4s or iPad 2/3(as an iPhone app) on iOS 4.3 or higher. Square Enix did not make this game compatible with iPods. I've played if for a while on my iPad 2 and I have to admit, its growing on me. Has that classic Square Enix RPG feel to it. I should also note that even though the download size is ~570MB, the actual installed game size is ~2.3GB!

Thank you to the uploader and happy torrenting!"
,AJShadowz,2012-09-05T06:28Z,FYI This game only works on iphone 4 and 4s people. I have it and its a great game but dont waste ur time if ur using ANY version of ipod or ipad (with the exception of new ipad but that one has its own version). Oh and another thing its not 500 mb it WILL take up 2.3 gb on ur iphone.
