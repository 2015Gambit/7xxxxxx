Information
------------------------------

Jimmy's Forest 
High up in a spectacular tree house, Jimmy Doherty develops an intimate understanding of the inner workings of a British forest. Country boy and farmer Jimmy Doherty is as happy as a pig in... Well, in a very nice pigsty. Holed up in a spectacular tree house, he's charting the seasonal changes of a Norfolk wood. Which means dissecting woodpeckers, eating roadkill, drinking sap from a tree and tracking deer. There are some brilliant nuggets of information and Jimmy's enthusiasm for the great outdoors is very infectious.



3)  Autumn 
It's autumn. The forest is bursting with fruit and nuts and is looking spectacular. Two of Jimmy's friends come to visit the tree house and are sent off to forage for their supper. Jimmy gets up close to a kestrel and reveals its super sense ability to detect and pounce on field voles. He meets a man who claims he can speak to owls, sees a long-eared bat, makes ink from oak galls and discovers the amazing natural properties of deer antlers.
