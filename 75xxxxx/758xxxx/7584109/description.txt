True Worshippers was established in 1996 as some young adults had encounters with the Holy Spirit. Their lives were then rebuilt on the truths and those youngsters became extremely passionate about God. As they gathered to seek God, there was an extreme manifestation of the Holy Spirit and they were renewed each day. More and more people came to join them and each was as thirsty for the presence o...
f God in their lives. In early 1997 God sent some of the most talented singers and musicians into this community, and together they produced an album which later entitled ..Penyembah Yang Benar.. (True Worshippers). The name was then chosen to represent the praise and worship team under the leadership of Jakarta Praise Community Church.

After the release of the first album, the response toward the youth movement was overwhelming; people from across the nations began to notice the change in the Christian youth community. The team grew in the knowledge of God and released their next albums. Those includes the solo albums by Sari Simorangkir, Sidney Mohede, Nindy Ellesse, and Giving My Best.
