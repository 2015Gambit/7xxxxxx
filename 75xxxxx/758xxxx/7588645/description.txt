Game Description:

The year is 1915. War has raised its ugly head to greet the nations of Europe. A year and a half after the events described in Shadow Hearts, the French town of Domremy resists German invasion, rumored to be protected by a demon. The German army sends Lieutenant Karin Koenig along with a man named Nicolas, allegedly an inquisitor from the Vatican, whose task is to exorcise the demon. When the two arrive in Domremy, events take an unexpected turn. Karin meets the young harmonixer Yuri Hyuga, who is afflicted with a curse that gradually saps the life out of him. Yuri travels across Europe and through Russia to the Far East, trying to find a cure before it is too late, and stop a secret society from dominating the world by political and magical means.

Shadow Hearts: Covenant is a direct sequel to Shadow Hearts, continuing its story and featuring the same main protagonist as well as a few recurrent characters. Like the previous game, it is set in a concrete historical epoch with heavy supernatural additions. Several historical characters, such as the Russian princess Anastasia, play important roles in the game's plot.
