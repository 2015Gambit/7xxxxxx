,Fayiirah,2012-08-29T21:10Z,"@sutil1 The musical this film was adapted from opened on Broadway in 1979. The Broadway show was based on a 1973 play. Not to mention that Sweeny Tood himself has been around since 1846.

But this is clearly a rip-off of an obscure 1967 Chinese film that has had a proper release only in China and Japan.

Yeah, okay."
