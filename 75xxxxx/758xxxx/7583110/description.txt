Leaked script for Michael Bay's (Teenage Mutant) Ninja Turtles.

Commentary from Michael Bay ( http://www.michaelbay.com/blog/files/3222faee36a89b4250907ab4d75a7291-776.php )



The leaked script for Ninja Turtles that different sites continue to comment on was written well before I, or anyone at Platinum Dunes, was involved with the project.

That script saw the shredder a long time ago.

This is tired, old news -- Wait for the movie!
