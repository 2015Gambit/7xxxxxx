,Skerdehur,2012-09-03T20:49Z,"missworld, over the past 10 or so years I've noticed that the average quality of torrents found online has improved substantially.  I believe that some raters' standards have improved along side this increase in quality, while others seem to rate audio and video quality using the same standards of yesteryear.  Furthermore, everyone will continue to have their own personal standards over video quality.  For example, some people prefer Blu-Ray quality, while others are fine with DVD quality.  I personally, can't stand watching cams, and will go to the theater to see a movie before i watch a cam.  Regardless, if you find others' rating systems to be too arbitrary, try looking at the file size of torrents.  Usually larger sizes correspond to higher quality videos."
