,Sargoth,2012-08-31T23:23Z,"good quality for ts. very watchable. except for few seconds of black picture with audio @ the beginning, definitively worth the dl"
,steven4,2012-09-01T09:50Z,thanx..rishman
,cjbobet,2012-09-01T10:53Z,"In spanish, please. En castellano, gracias."
,jason69bourne,2012-09-01T18:15Z,"quality... V=9
              A=10
BUT I DID READ THE BOOK AND THIS IS NOT THE BOURNE LEGACY, 
 THIS MOVIE STARTS REAL SLOW AND KEEPS THAT WAY UNTIL ABOUT 10 MINUTES FROM THE END STILL IT DOES'NT DELIVER THE PUNCH
 I WOULD GIVE IT A 3/10 VEARY DISAPPOINTING."
,metanick,2012-09-01T19:12Z,"For those of us who are used to watching regular rips and for some odd reason feel tempted to download this TS because ""It can't be that bad -- can it?""... well, yes -- it can. The torrent might pass for ""watchable"" according to the dubious standards of the cam and TS watchers, but if you are used to DVD rips and screeners you'll be sorely disappointed. 

Sorry to be a downer. ;-)"
,HDAttitude,2012-09-01T23:26Z,"For those like me who watch cams, is this watchable?"
,agosign,2012-09-03T01:07Z,"real good quality for ts. very watchable. Definitively worth the dl -  just downsize screen size slightly.

thks upldr"

,missworld,2012-09-07T17:53Z,"If you want an honest mark out of 10 without the bullshit and it's watchable for a cam/TS malarky- 

A/V/8/6

Wait on a better version "

dude stop yelling, that shit is annoying =/"
,xanat0s,2012-09-08T06:04Z,"@metanick

like babybeel said no need to apologize. i don't even pay attention to these ppl's ""quality ratings"" anymore. it reminds me of imdb, ppl either rate way to high or way to low to have any real meaning to the rest of us"
,coresnake,2012-09-08T13:45Z,"A 9
V 9

Great quality for a TS, shame the movie was rather... crap."
,harrythehound,2012-09-08T20:39Z,"@BabyBeel

wait, this is a magnet link, how can you download just the sample ? i don't get a list of files in utorrent with magnet links..."
,hisicon,2012-09-09T00:34Z,"@metanick
Actually really appreciate your comment as well - I almost downloaded but I'm indeed spoiled by DVD rip qualities so you saved me the disappointment!"
,You_Muppet,2012-09-09T13:10Z,"Thanks S4A. As ever, you're the best.

Not sure how this is either a '9' or 'awful', as some of the above have said. I'd give it A=7, V=6.

For those not too picky, this is very watchable.

And people, this movie was recorded by some guy using his camera in a dark theatre. Of course it's not gonna be as good as a DVD rip. But it's free and it's months in advance of the DVD, so quit posting how you've been 'saved'. I'm frikkin' grateful that people like S4A take the time to do all the hard work, so I don't have to do nothing but enjoy.

,vocalised80,2012-09-12T15:04Z,@spam.......get back in your can.
,makreza,2012-09-13T12:21Z,"We all want Bourne, but this is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and Weisz were great, but I think the scripting has been derided by many as terrible. I had no issues with anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation.  I saw it with great quality on latest.haxshells.us and i recommend this movie to all, totally worth watching."
,TtToker,2012-09-14T05:05Z,"@Metanick, So if I don't like cam rips I probably won't like this cam rip? cool dude, I too must thank you for the dumbest comment ever posted on tpb. You're in no way a downer, you're a douche bag. There's nothing wrong with being a torrent snob, but posting your ridiculous standards to try to make yourself look or feel high and mighty must be embarrassing if you really think about it.

To anybody that is interested in watching this movie for the story and don't need gimmicks or graphic effects to hold your attention for more than minutes at a time, this is actually worth watching if you're a fan but can't or don't want to pay to see in theaters and can't wait for a real rip. 

but like common sense (aka Metanick) said, ""For those of *US* that don't like cam rips, don't bother downloading a cam rip"".

PS everybody on the internet now looks up to you for your apparent high standards and your willingness to share your thoughts, no matter how unhelpful it is and how douchey it may make you come off.."

Thank you for your kind words. I feel honored.

,jademoore6,2012-09-15T06:56Z,"Good upload, there are some black screens on the movie, but that's tolerable

for a cam it's a/v 8/8

if I would compare it to a DVDrip a/v 7/6"
