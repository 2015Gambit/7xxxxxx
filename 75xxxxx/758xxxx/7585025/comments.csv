,DimsumDynam,2012-09-01T02:07Z,"@asdfkjjj - you clearly don't know anything about scene rules. They are there for standards and quality. This release is around 5 hours. If a normal say 2 hour movie was encoded into 2 700MB avi's - so a total of 1.4GB - that would be fine. But if 5 hours was to be encoded into the same size then the video encoding bitrate would have to be greatly reduced in order to fit 5 hours into the same 1.4GB. This means the video would look like shit. Whats the point of trying to enjoy a video if it looks like shit? If this release was 2hours or less, then it would have been encoded as either a 700MB single avi or a 2x700MB release."
