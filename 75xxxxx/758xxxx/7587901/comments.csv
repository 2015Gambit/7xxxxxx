,SE_Scania,2012-09-01T08:31Z,"Hello Macinhack and all other seeders. Please let us complete it then, not like version beta1... I have been waiting in nearly 2 days for the  last 14 % ....."
,SE_Scania,2012-09-01T08:53Z,.... And of course I would like to donate. But I just have to complete the download before... I have been faked so many times by uploads for the unsupported macs ;O)
,SE_Scania,2012-09-01T09:10Z,"By the way ... please make some serious seed! 

I wonder if you say, that 1000s have downloaded the beta1... why so many haven't completed it, and stop at 85%. The connection was unstable, and I sorry to say it seems to be the same for this version.

And I wonder if you don't have a fast connection, why not use services like rapidshare?

,SE_Scania,2012-09-01T11:38Z,As typical... STOPPED AT 26% 
,Star_blazer,2012-09-01T18:12Z,I got 5Gb of Ram.....damn!! Thanks for the effort;))
,Macinhack,2012-09-01T19:29Z,I'm really sorry for the inconvenience guys now it should work better. B
,Macinhack,2012-09-01T19:32Z,"@SE_Scania yeah sorry again from now I'll seed as much as I can.
@Star_blazer i hate the limit, too. but no idea why, but it kernel panics when you have more than 4 gigs.... "
,exodusdan,2012-09-02T04:34Z,Looking forward to trying this-it is moving a bit slow though... will seed 2:2
,SE_Scania,2012-09-02T13:51Z,"My torrent client tells me there is an error in block #1930 - after it have completed, so I can't even open the DMG or burn it... :o( 

Any way, only 4Gb... I have 28Gb in my Mac Pro 1,1 and need them all for animation and graphic design... "
,SE_Scania,2012-09-02T18:20Z,"I had to re-download it. Everything is working. But for my old MacBook 4,1 (2008/Mac-F22788A9) there is no opportunity to enable the sound. Strange, for under the systemprofile for the mac, it told me it could recognize the Intel soundsystem.

It can't also not be updated even automatic or manual. Please let me know you or some others have solved this problem.

For my Mac Pro 1,1 (2006/Mac-F4208DC8) the installation failed. Can't even boot the installer up.

Maybe the link http://hardware4linux.info/ could help some great developer-team to make a new beta or fully working edition with the right kexts.

I would like to have tested it, but i'm to stupid to understand codes like this.

A mistake, sorry ...
The previous comment was addressed to ANOTHER TORRENT...
I meant downloading the previous BETA1 version.

Castellano:
Un error, lo siento…
El comentario anterior IBA DIRIGIDO AL OTRO TORRENT…
Me refería a la descarga de la versión BETA1 anterior."
,SE_Scania,2012-09-03T10:42Z,How do you update it with the 10.8.1 or 10.8.2?
,Macinhack,2012-09-03T12:12Z,@SE_Scania just download the update and install it
,SE_Scania,2012-09-04T09:30Z,"Well I have downloaded the update manual from the Apple's website. 

After I have opened the dmg and the pkg-file, I get to the point to select the destination. 
But I can't choose any drive. There is yellow warnings which says: ""OS X Update can't be installed on this disk. This volume does not meet the requirements for this update""

I have done all as you told me in the guide for the installation. 

The mac is the white MacBook4,1. Please let me know what to do, thanks"

,pgrif,2012-09-05T04:28Z,I DL'ed this(it took a while) and got it working right away on my Nov. 2007 MacBook 3.1. The only thing that doesn't work is Youtube with Google Chrome.
,yuckz0ne,2012-09-05T22:11Z,"Und wie installiere ich es am besten auf eine Zweitpartition neben Lion?

- iUTA bootfähig auf einen USB Stick formatieren und von diesem starten und installieren.

oder

- Lion auf die zweite Partition installieren und einfach iUTA auf dieser Partition starten.


Vieen Dank

PS: Hast du auch eine Website oder ähnliches, wo du das Projekt bewirbst?

Liebe Grüße"
