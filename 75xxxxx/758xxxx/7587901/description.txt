QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS AND HELPERS, THIS IS MY MAIL ADRESS FOR THIS PROJECT!!!! SUPPORT IN ENGLISH, GERMAN (PREFERRED, I  A M  GERMAN, HEHE) AND A BIT FRENCH!!!
PLEASE BUY A MOUNTAIN LION LICENCE IF YOU LIKE IT. AND, PLEASE DONATE A DOLLAR OR TWO. YOU KNOW, OVER 1000 PEOPLE DOWNLOADED iUTA 1.0B1. AND  NO ONE DONATED A PENNY. AGAIN, AS I SAID IN BETA1, IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE PROJECT ALIVE AND ME A BIT HAPPY, PLEASE  DONATE.

WHY I DID THIS:

I was pissed up. Why has Apple kicked our good "old" Macs??? I have an Early 2008 MacBook with 4 Gigs of RAM. That's the last unsupported MacBook. It still runs pretty good and I don't plan to upgrade it. I was angry. After a bit of researching and experimenting I found a solution. Now I want you guys to be able to use OS X 10.8 on your "old" Mac, too :D

PS: Please do NOT copy this. This costed me over a week of hard working and experimenting and this is only the beta. I integrated some backdoors so I can see if some d*ckheads copy my work. That would NOT be nice and I would NOT try to do it. If you are smart and discovered something, you can mail me, but, again, please do NOT copy parts or more from my modded ML setup. This was only a warning. Now let's get back to work.

COMPATIBLE WITH:

Open System Profiler (in the Utilities-Folder). Please keep in mind this is still beta and just for testing.
iUTA is tested with the following Macs:

-Mac minis with X3100 > fine
-Mac Pros with upgraded graphics > fine
-MacBooks with X3100 > Works, display brightness and sleep not working (yet)
-MacBookAir with X3100 > Works, display brightness & sleep issue 
-MacBookPros with X1600 > Graphics don't work really well, don't found compatible kexts yet
-MacBooks with GMA 950 > Works, some little issues
-iMacs with GMA 950 >Works, some little issues
-iMacs with X1900 > Graphics don't work really well, don't found compatible kexts yet
-Mac Minis with GMA 950 > Graphics don't work really well, don't found compatible kexts yet

EXPERIMENTAL (don't try if you have no special mac knowledge):

-Macs with Geforce 7xxx > not tested by me, copied lion kexts, mail me about your experience
-Macs with Radeon X1000 > not tested by me, copied lion kexts, mail me about your experience

ATTENTION!!! This build of iUTA does not support over 4 GB of RAM. More will crash the setup. I have no idea how to fix itΓÇª..

Other Macs aren't tested but MAY work! If you like experimenting, you can help me and try other macs.
ted ML-mac :D

For everything after setupΓÇª. :

1. If you own a macbook, i would recommend to install nosleep. NoSleep is a little tool witch prevents your mb from crashing when you close the lid
Some apps crashΓÇª u know, ur running ML on an officially unsupported Mac and iUTA is still betaΓÇª. i try my best to try out other kexts for making it more attractive for uΓÇª. Please contribute and help me making iUTA better. Our eMail:
