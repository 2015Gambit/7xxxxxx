,jersson,2012-08-29T23:34Z,The problems with keys is that if you install it and use it on line it get's blacklisted after a while. So do not install on line. Disconnect your internet connection while installing Please.

,ROCKnTIME,2012-08-30T18:50Z,It's not the final version.. It's Microsoft Office 2013 15.0.4128.1014 Preview both x32 & x64 versions.. Don't bother downloading..

you are great bro"
,rayr_1,2012-08-31T01:46Z,Dont bother downloading as this is just the preview version. This is not the first time that bobrias2009 just uploads stuff without checking it out.
[T],bobiras22,2012-08-31T03:05Z,"@rayr_1

In TPB site there isnt this version.Just make a search.There is only the exe files.I have instructions on how to activate it and provide also working keys.I put word final to introduce that till now this is the final version of office 2013 not that microsoft has release THE FINAL VERSION of office 2013.
Maybe you must check more often my uploads.Yes i have made 1 mistake with one of my uploads but hei i am human not a robot.Who havent done mistakes?Nobody i think.Next time respect the uploader and his/her work.The critisism is so easy right?Do something usefull instead of complain all the time."
,TunaHead,2012-08-31T03:12Z,"bobirAss, is this the final version or just the preview?"
[T],bobiras22,2012-08-31T03:22Z,"@TunaHead

This is not the preview.This is a version after the preview it is newer.The preview versions are:

Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 Consumer Preview x86.exe   625.47 MiB

Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 Consumer Preview x64.exe   704.06 MiB

And this versions are:

professionalplus_en-us_x86.exe	624.52 MB

professionalplus_en-us_x64.exe	702.92 MB

So no this is not the Preview Version.This is the Latest Version for the Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus."

,ROCKnTIME,2012-08-31T12:19Z,Just so we all understand… I’m slow..  When I go to install this program and it clearly states it’s the customer preview version of office you’re still claiming it’s not the customer preview version? Nice.. 
[T],bobiras22,2012-08-31T14:04Z,"@ROCKnTIME

This is a version after the preview.Yea ok it stated as preview but i clearly post above the original files and their MB and if this is are the preview is will have the same MBS as the customer preview that already uploaded in TPB."

Have you any older version installed in your computer?Also you try the above instructions on how to activate it?Also you must install and it and activating offline.Then you can open your internet again.So if you havent done that try to unistall it and install it with internet connection off and activated offline too."
,trankilino,2012-08-31T18:49Z,Thanks Man! 
,remoted96052,2012-08-31T19:14Z,"bobiras22
Thanks for your quick reply. I have no older version of Microsoft Office on my computer. I also followed your instructions on how to activate and everything seemed to go properly. My computer is on cable (Time Warner Cable), so will have to try and figure how to get off line with it. Thanks again for the great upload and help. Appreciate it very much.

[T],bobiras22,2012-08-31T19:30Z,"@remoted96052

Yes if you do that with my instructions all will go fine.Also activate it offline and all will be fine."
,panpanbebe,2012-08-31T19:36Z,When I installed this still showing preview edition.
,remoted96052,2012-08-31T19:43Z,"bobiras22
Ok, I uninstalled the program, and got to work offline, and re-installed your program and followed your activation instructions, when done I got back online and went to one of the files under Microsoft Office, and still got the pop-up window that I got before. Nothing else I can do I guess, as I seem to have done everything right, but just not going to get rid of that pesky pop-up window.
Thanks anyway for a great upload and all your help.

[T],bobiras22,2012-08-31T21:35Z,"@remoted96052

Would you try to activate it offline and then open a document again in offline mode and see if the pop up still show up?"
,mayank21,2012-09-01T07:50Z,"@bobiras22

I tried the way u said! I went offline, installed Office 2013 & installed product key! Everything was done offline. Also, I tried opening Word file offline but still the Activation Wizard keeps popping up even in when I'm offline. Any help?

Anyways its a very quality upload! Thanks for the torrent mate!!"
,PrasadK,2012-09-01T07:54Z,It's clearly a PREVIEW !!
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-01T09:05Z,"@mayank21

Do that and tell me if still the pop up show up:

To change your product key via Control Panel, open the “Add/Remove Programs” applet (Windows XP) or the “Uninstall a Program” applet (Windows Vista or Windows 7). Locate your Office 2010/2013 application and press Change. Setup will now start with the option “Enter a Product Key” which allows you to enter a different product key.

And put one of these keys:

TD8JN-CM7XB-4DX86-BBKCF-8BYP8

9KDTN-KMXY4-DC243-RF9RF-GXR9J

Let me know if this work for you.And thank for your good words."
,ccsdude82,2012-09-01T10:43Z,"Thanks for the files, @bobiras22!

I'm having the exact same problem as @mayank21 though, and I just tried with the 2 keys you just posted but still the popup shows up every time I open word or any other office programs =/"
,mayank21,2012-09-01T11:07Z,"@bobiras22

Thanks for the reply mate. Did exactly as you said, tried with both the keys but still the Activation Wizard popups up! :(
FYI I did it all offline. Any help is highly appreciated!

Login with ur Live! account & take the Key from there!

It activated without any issues & Activation Wizard doesn't pops out now!
I'm just wondering for how long is the official key valid???

@bobiras22 Are your keys activated forever???

Do let me know if it works!"
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-01T12:10Z,"@ccsdude82

@mayank21

The problem are in the keys.Maybe they get blacklisted.Through here:

https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/wizard.aspx?wizid=f2648d40-84ce-4556-8545-93d52a3253f2&lcid=1033&ci=393

as mayank21 mention get your new key.I dont for how long they will stay activated.But when they get blacklisted make a new key through this page.Or till then there will be a newer version for MS office 2013 with new keys.Till then just relax and enjoy your MS Office 2013"
,lastMan66,2012-09-01T21:45Z,Does it have integration with new start menu in windows 8 already?
,lanc123,2012-09-02T01:01Z,"This is a preview only version.
It's not fully functional in terms of all the final cosmetics and when the trial expires it will have to be removed as it does not support an upgrade capability to the final released version"
