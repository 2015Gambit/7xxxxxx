 The Blues Trail

Take a road trip down the Blues Trail, and stop along the way to take in the music and the food that make up the unique flavor of the Mississippi Delta, from Memphis, TN to Jackson, MS. Andrew samples Southern standbys and riffs on old favorites, like "redneck ramen" made with noodles and pigs ears.
