"Play Motel" is a very rare giallo that features Ray Lovelock in a tale of a Motel that has a playroom designed for more interesting sexual liaisons.

The place also makes a habit of photographing the sexual encounters and blackmailing the parties involved. Add to this a black gloved killer and some "Hard Core" inserts and you have one of the weirdest giallos your ever going to see.

"Play Motel" by Mario Gariazzo mixes giallo, crime and comedy with plenty of Hard Core Sex.The music is pretty bad, however the addition of black gloved killer is a nice touch.

Ray Lovelock and Annamaria Rizzoli are very enjoyable as the two lovers. Overall, I loved this ultra-sleazy giallo and you should too, if you are into Italian smut.
