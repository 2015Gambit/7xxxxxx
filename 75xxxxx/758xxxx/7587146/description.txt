This is the most complete season 4 that I've been able to produce. I had to download from many sources to find legit episodes. All are in English and in HDTV. All the "complete" season torrents I could find were far from it. So I hope you enjoy!

Only 2 episodes missing:

American.Chopper.S04E05 - Special
American.Chopper.S04E11 - Peavey Go Fast Bike 2

I searched for both and they were always corrupt and/or in german.
