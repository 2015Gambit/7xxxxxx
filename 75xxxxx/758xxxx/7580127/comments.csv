this release includes additions like this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7290856/Zygor_s_Leveling_Guides_3.3.3810_(22nd_May_2012) ?"
,psyched,2012-08-29T06:56Z,"Thats correct this includes That leveling gude and more, within an addonUI which isnt completely 100% broken. trust me i tried to play today without this new addon."
,Securitron,2012-08-29T07:49Z,"@gsdaga, there is no talent advisor yet, because the talent system was just revamped."
,psyched,2012-08-29T08:34Z,"This release DOES have the talent advisor for the latest patch 5.0.4

This is confirmed!"
,Forwaistee,2012-08-29T09:44Z,Will you upload MoP guides as well? (When they come out ofc)
,Somacruz_92,2012-08-29T09:49Z,"I've bought Zygor myself but can't afford to upgrade just yet, so, this is my solution. Cheers."
,husn2503,2012-08-29T16:57Z,"thanks alot mate, are you goint to upload the guide on 25th Sep for leveling 1-90 ?

,mario0029,2012-08-29T17:10Z,I just put this in it works but doesn't goto 86
,mario0029,2012-08-29T17:11Z,Thanks for the up and fix though. Keep up the great work :)
,Jkilz,2012-08-29T17:27Z,"Im confused on how this is supposed to work, cuz its one file. Can someone that got it to work explain to me exactly how this file works? It downloads as a file, what type of file is supposed to be? help would be greatly appreciated."
,husn2503,2012-08-29T17:31Z,"mario0029

the 85-90 is not yet updated, it will be updated on 25th Sep or a week before ... this info from Zygor website "
,Jkilz,2012-08-29T17:36Z,Can someone please help me make this work? im not sure how to cuz nothing shows up in the addons when i use this to enable.
,yunotreg,2012-08-29T19:23Z,"thanks for sharing this. also, the macro section is missing i think."
,Chaos621,2012-08-29T22:13Z,"I am not making any accusations, but I am pretty thrown off by this, 1. because it is posted in the ""Porn"" section, 2. because 5.0.4 was released yesterday. 

I have been downloading from Forland91 for almost 3 years now, and all of a sudden you and TFR pop up out of no where.  

I truly want to believe this is legitimate, it would be awesome to have since my Zygor is jacked all up, but unfortunately I don't have the means to properly detect a virus besides the traditional means.

Either way, I will have a friend of mine check this out and let you all know if it is clean and safe.  If it is, HUGE props to you Psyched, we will all appreciate it very much."
,psyched,2012-08-30T02:52Z,"Thanks all for the feedback, this release is compatible with 5.0.4, it is listed as MOP as the game is now MOP (version 5.X.X) i will put in the 85-90 guides as soon as i get them but even i dont pay for zygor's :)

As for virus scanning, go to virustotal.com and upload the file it will scan with over 40 AV's you'll see its clean i run sophos with latest updates.
"
,psyched,2012-08-30T02:55Z,"instructions: you use a program such as winrar to extract the files, they will all be in 1 folder, move the folder to ""world of warcaft[slash]interface[slash]addons"" sorry TPB doesnt do slashes in comments, but effectively, open your world of warcraft folder, open the interface folder and then open your addons folder, paste the extracted folder to that location, open WOW. If wow was already opened close and re-open it.

as for being in the porn section that was my mistake when creating the torrent i pressed 'G' for games and didnt check the subcategory :/ and yes this is the first release and others have been doing it for years but 12 hours after release of the patch its not up and it took me 10 minutes to make it work i thought i would share for the masses.. 

as for scanning with an AV upload it to virustotal.com and check with 40 different AV clients.

enjoy all."
,Wykd_Wolf,2012-08-30T19:29Z,"OMFG. THANK YOU. If this works, you are my hero. :)"
,Mourad88,2012-08-31T19:02Z,"Can confirm that this torrent works.

Huge thanks to the uploader!!"
,mimic78,2012-08-31T21:09Z,"My zygor wasn't really working properly since the patch. No arrow pointing, no location on mini map, no switching through quests completed etc. So I downloaded this one to update it. Yeah still not working. Waste of time."
,Wykd_Wolf,2012-08-31T21:30Z,"This torrent works, but the guide DOES NOT WORK for Sunstrider Isle, for some reason. I started a Blood Elf, and it's BADLY off."
,wenex,2012-08-31T23:53Z,didn't work for me either
,Vitaminsmore,2012-09-01T02:59Z,"If you download the Tomtom addon and go under zygor settings. Waypoints, set it to tomtom  instead of built in. The arrow will work. I found the old add on before an update still works to some degree. Works for EK as well Wrath. I haven't checked the other ones. It would auto switch when i completed a quest but would not auto accept or turn in. I'm looking forward to the one for MoP. the quest in beta are easy but this make things so much faster..

@jkilz - you must have winrar or 7zip in oder to extract this. Both are free and once you have either of them click the file and extract and send it to your wow addon folder."
,Vegasbob,2012-09-03T10:18Z,Sorry....what is this shit doing in the porn games section?
,ez100,2012-09-03T16:21Z,"Yeah there are thousands of errors in these guides. I'm not sure if it Zygor and he just did a shitty job of patching or the uploader of the torrent. Either way
***BE WARNED THERE IS ERRORS*** 
but I'm sure a better version will come along soon enough ^.^"
,wenex,2012-09-04T00:17Z,anybody seen a working version post patch of this? this one didn't work for me
,LunarisDream,2012-09-04T00:51Z,BEST PORN EVER
,husn2503,2012-09-07T02:38Z,"its working for patch 5.0.4, i am doing my dailies + i am lvling my alt from 80-85 with this update, thanks "
,sixox,2012-09-08T14:20Z,Autoaccepting quest/turning in doesn't work
,husn2503,2012-09-08T20:00Z,"sixox

go to setting when you open Zygor in game, go to Extra features and you will see the options "
,rizla50,2012-09-11T09:23Z,"Just about everything works for me. Using it to grind my NetherDrake following the guide. My lower level alt seems to have the auto turnins work glitch free.

Really nice. Keep it up."
