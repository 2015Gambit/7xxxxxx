-Source Notes-

// : Cut. There is a cut at the end of Graves. Right after the jam
as Dave begins "I can't belive that we would..." There is another cut
at the end of John The Revelator that cuts out in the jam and comes
back on before "Love of My Life." One of them is most likely a botched
DAT flip where music was cut.

There is clipping for the first few minutes of Graves. This is not a
perfect tape, but it is still a 99 dsbd:)
