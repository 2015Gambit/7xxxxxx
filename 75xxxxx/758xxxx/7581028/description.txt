Nicolas Cage Collection 1982 - 1999 (Part 1) by Waldek for SceneTime
[color=darkred][b][size=4]
Please read:[/size][/b][/color]
This pack contains a lot of old films with Nicolas Cage. Obviously not every movie is available in HD, some of them are not even available in high quality. I've searched a lot for good quality films, part of them is downloaded from Russian trackers, some are from Polish and Serbian trackers, several are widely available on various global trackers. Almost every file was edited by me to delete additional sound tracks (I've left only English audio and all available subtitles). I've converted all files (NOT recompressed) to mkv, but I left original codecs in most of them. You can simply read in filenames what video codec is, what is source of movie and eventually if it has HD or FullHD resolution. Filesize is given too, so you can calculate how good quality is. Maybe I'll add some frames of every movie to show their quality, but only if you will be interested in this. I've ripped some of them from original DVD or BD to get quite good quality against poor copies that are going round. There is only one film without English audio. [i]Tempo di Uccidere (Time to kill) 1989[/i]. All available sources were outdated and I found only Italian (original probably), polish and Russian versions, so this one film has it all. I've prepared subtitles to that one in English, but they are automatic translated from Bulgarian (!). If someone will be that good and will correct this subtitles, I'd be glad.
There is no such pack available in internet and it took a lot of time to prepare that, so I hope that you will enjoy this one. I'll upload next pack (years 2000+) after this one. Please seed as long, as possible, because such big pack are quite hard to keep alive for one seed. I will seed it to 100% and a bit more mostly from my home connection (2Mbit) but several time a week I'm uploading with broadband so it should take max 1 week to upload it completely. More peers = faster upload on broadband = more seeds after all = higher download speed. remmember that :)
All comments are welcome.
