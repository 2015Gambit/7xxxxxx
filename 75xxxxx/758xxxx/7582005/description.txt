Originally designed for the Royal National Institute for the Blind in response 
to a need for improving text for television subtitling. The Digital Video 
Broadcasting has adopted the Tiresias Screenfont as the standard font for the 
Multimedia Home Platform, which many set-top box and digital TV 
manufacturers are using as their standard development platform. 
 
The Tiresias Screenfont includes characters that are easy to distinguish from 
one another. Throughout the design process, the key factors that affect 
legibility were studied. 
 
This font has met with widespread approval. The design team is confident 
that this new typeface brings considerable improvement to the legibility of 
text on screens.



This font is used all over the world for tv and film subtitling and can cost up $ 17,000.

This is the latest version of the font.
