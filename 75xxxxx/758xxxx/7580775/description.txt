production methods also had a very dark side: his judeophobia 
or irrational hate of Jews.

He published a book, "The International Jew" in which he accepted 
the authenticity of the Russian forgery, The Protocols of Zion, that 
the Senate of the United States after a lengthy investigation proved 
that it was a crude forgery.

A group of Jews then took him to court for slander, he could not 
prove his case and when being questioned in court revealed by 
his answers his absolute IGNORANCE of historical matters, even 
the exact date of American independence and other facts even a 
schoolboy knew, a tremendous embarrassment.

Afterwards, being the ruling against him, Henry Ford, the man 
who received a medal from Hitler, had to abjectly apologize to 
the Jews in writing for his slander.

Read the text and don't let neo-nazi liars fool you by mentioning 
Henry Ford's book as true historical evidence against the Jews.
