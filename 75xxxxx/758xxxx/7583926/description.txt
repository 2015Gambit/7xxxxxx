Control Your Music With a Wave of Your Hand!
Uses the proximity sensor on your phone to allow control of your music playback by waving your hand over your phone. No need to turn on your screen or even touch your phone at all!

Pro Features:

    No Ads
    More Commands
    Assign Which Gesture Does Which Command

Coming Soon:

    More Features - feel free to email any requests you have
    Update the UI

Easy to use, just wave your hand over the sensor (usually located just next to the earpiece on your phone).

    Holding it there will Pause/Resume
    One wave across will go to the Next Song
    Two waves across will go to the Previous Song
    Three times (needs to be fast) will Pause or Resume the controls

Be sure to enable Headset Button Control in your player of choice

Notes:

    There is a little less than a second to register your waves.
    Tip for the hover gesture: if you move your hand away too quickly it'll register a wave
    After an action, there is a 1 second delay before another gesture will be registered
    Will work with any player that accepts headset (media button) controls
    If the screen is off or another app is in focus, phone vibrates once on pause control and twice on resume controls 
    Practice your wave techniques by checking the "Last Action" 
    If you're getting another player responding to the commands, check if that app has the option to disable headset button controls
