,MMusic123,2012-08-30T18:00Z,dark shadows will be released on dvd/blueray in 1 month  Oct 2 (1 month aprox.).  I'll wait for a better copy with english subs- shouldn't be too long of a wait for perfect copy torrent leak.

,MyKrossini,2012-08-31T02:18Z,OK well here goes... A/V 8/7. I think that's rather generous. Much better than any cam or TS. Video is kinda glitchy in some spots. Audio gets out of sync several times. A little yellow circle with the number 15 pops up in the upper right corner periodically throughout the film. All in all it's watchable and worth downloading if you can't wait for a DVD or blu ray rip.  Thanks for the upload scene4all!
,DarthBubba,2012-08-31T05:36Z,"While I generally agree with MyKrossini's description, I found the video choppy (as in ""not smooth"") and the audio off-putting.  This certainly is not an HDrip - it's not even DVD quality IMHO.  Wait for a proper copy unless you're a big-time Johnny Depp or Dark Shadows fan.  A=6 V=6 for a disc copy.

Thanks for the upload none-the-less."

,aradiel,2012-09-01T18:26Z,"Do NOT download this. Heavily cropped, as mention. Various Asian text and random numbers etc. on it. Also, both audio and visual are quite bad. Low frame rate, and tinny audio.

DVD rips are out, get those instead. This should never have been released."
