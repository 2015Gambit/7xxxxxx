THe reasons I didn't mux the subs in mkv;
Some folks won't play flawlessly if many subs are in mkv, and some players will play with external subs only.
Also sometimes some award symbol or timing error in srt can create a glitch in mkv.
The original subs are hard to read so I edited the color palette, but they only work if they are external.
See the difference: http://imgbox.com/g/HqCmXZE3UB
Not everyone needs those subs.
Why rarred?, because we save space;
-The Pink Panther (2006) SUBTITLES 142 MB rarred is only 40.3 MB.
-The Pink Panther 2 2009 SUBTITLES 139 MB rarred is only 34.6 MB.
You don't need to extract all subs. 
Just double click on rar/double click on folder/put the cursor on the subs you want and drop them next to the movie, 
then drop the idx on the movie (started with MPC).
