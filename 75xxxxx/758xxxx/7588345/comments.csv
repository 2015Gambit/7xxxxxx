,dhjudasx,2012-09-03T07:59Z,"anyone feel like giving me some feedback on this first torrent in terms of if it works great with xbox/ps3/smarttv/mobile devices and if the 2 channel stereo and 5.1 aac tracks work dandy?

Personally Power DVD doesn't seem to want to play the 5.1 audio track... and won't allow me to select it... but Windows Media Player and VLC and numerous other devices seem to work great. The smart tv i've used also allows me to select the 5.1 track fine too.

I just wanted to see how this did, And if i should bother attempting to upload more converted rips.... Take in suggestions if anyone had any.... or what have you. I just know that so many of the torrents are usually gigantic files with surround... or relatively small with only 2 channel. And the reasonable small ones have good quality video but hugely disappointing audio due to being only 2 channel stereo....

Thanks for anyone bothering to see this by the way."
