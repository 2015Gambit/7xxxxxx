,chop007,2012-09-01T20:52Z,"Says this version is obsolete and it will take you to a web page to install more recent version. And yes, my internet was disconnected when installing. Absolute crap upload. Same with your other two programs from stardock. Do you know most people come here to find cracked software, not trial software that is 6 million years old? Anyways, don't know what excitement or joy you get from uploading crap other than maybe you are like 12 years old and haven't got a clue. Thanks anyways but that is the last time I take time to download anything with your name behind it. No offense bro, I appreciate the master hackers and crackers here at PB they help a poor man but guys like you just crack me up, seriously?"
