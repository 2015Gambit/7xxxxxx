This masterpiece directed by Renato Polselli (aka Ralph Brown) was made in 1973, but censors deemed it to demeaning towards women.  

The films dialog was changed, and not released until 1979, the film now seemed to take a different approach, now aimed at masculine perversions.  

The film presents an array of nasty stuff like, intercourse with a tree branch, candle masturbation, whipping, orgies, toe masturbation, and a woman screwing around with a real corn cob.
