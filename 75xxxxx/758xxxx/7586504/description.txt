The overall result is exceptionally good, not only because of the individual
playing but because of the overal feeling of a band that creates something
unique. Like the Ornette Coleman quartet, this is freedom in a fixed format,
not the long expansive improvisations of the later Coltrane or Ayler, but
expressive power without restraints within the confines of concept and
structure and time. It reads like a paradox, and well, maybe it is, the
characteristic of all great music.
