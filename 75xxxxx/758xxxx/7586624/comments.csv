So fuck you @TtToker & get the sand out your Va Jay Jay..

And fuck you @mcrowley ""Aleister Crowley YOU LYING MOFO.""  This does not work fine on Xbox :|

Finally thank you @ExtremeZone for your upload and effort.  Usually your uploads work perfectly when streaming, and I'm fully aware that these copies you upload are really made for viewing on computer or burning off."

,SCSA420,2012-09-01T22:10Z,"I'm holding out for the 720p or 1080p version and unlike most people I am an old school Dark Shadows fan and I have the entire Original Dark Shadows TV series here in XviD format all 1,225 episodes of it plus all 12 episodes of the 1990's remake and both of the original movies House of Dark Shadows and Night of Dark Shadows. 

I personally think this movie is a joke compared to the original TV series because it was never a comedy like this movie is but a true gothic horror series that came on 5 days a week originally from 1966-1971."

,YardBoy,2012-09-02T20:07Z,"@nonplus86
I trust you mean Cinavia copy protection.  That or some other scheme may be in this UL'ed AVI.  I can play it fine on my netbook using Totem 2.30.2 under Ubuntu.  However, the AVI is immediately rejected on my LG BD570 BR player that has a USB port thru which I've played hundreds of PB downloads.  I suspect the BD570 firmware is co-operating with the Cinavia just as the Dark Shadow authors intended."

The quality of the video could have been a little better given the size. File doesn't utilize B-frames (as it should) and there is some visible blockiness. But other Xvid releases are save (don't forget to add .avi to the name you will enter). It 'll take less than 4 minutes.

Now excuse me I have to seed."

V:9, A:10

The quality of the video could have been a little better given the size. File doesn't utilize B-frames (as it should) and there is some visible blockiness. But other Xvid releases are less than 1GB in size, so I guess this is better.

Also, you may have to repack the file using Avidemux (open source - no install required) to be able to play this on some standalone DVD players. To do this, open avidemux, click flie-open. Then, make sure on the left of the window that ""video"" is set to ""copy"", ""audio"" to ""copy"" and ""format"" to ""AVI"". Then click file-save (don't forget to add .avi to the name you will enter). It 'll take less than 4 minutes.

Now excuse me I have to seed."
,eragon.rox,2012-09-03T17:32Z,"I always go to extremezone for my downloads, great quality as always! Thankyou, will seed for at least a week!"
,YardBoy,2012-09-03T18:49Z,"kudos to @kurkos_dr
for the Avidemux solution to the Cinavia/standalone player issue.  I haven't tried it yet, but at least kurkos_dr contributes.

When [if] you research Avidemux as you should with any download, you'll find many sources, some potentially with malware.  Download from a trusted source like the Avidemux authors, avidemux.org, or try sourceforge.net or download,cnet.com

Oh yeah, currently up to 6.51X.  You?"

Probably the worse movie Depp ever made. Well, he did co-produce, so he is partially responsible for such a dull and boring performance.
