With the changing world of today we have found that bylaws and certain appointments in the church have changed from a scripture based rules to what men think.the Church created by Christ must soley be run by scriptures not the opinions of men.Now writing this may cause many to argue or be offended but the point still remains that scriptures run the church (or rather they should given that many churches do not walk according to scriptures) in this document one aspect will be looked upon only through scriptures, though one may saw it is by your opinion you interpret the scriptures; but one should realize that scriptures interpret scriptures, therefore one cannot build a doctrine one one scripture all scriptures relating to the topic in hand must be gathered, studied and prayed over so as to gain godly understanding and wisdom from them.
