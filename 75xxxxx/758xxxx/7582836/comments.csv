I have a question: there are not many DTS upmixes available on The Pirate Bay, but there used to be two or three new ones every day at Demonoid.  Do you have any idea where (at which Web site) all of those people are now uploading their work?  I tried to contact someone at SBU who helped me in the past, but did not get an answer.

Again, many thanks, and keep on with the fantastic upmixes!"
