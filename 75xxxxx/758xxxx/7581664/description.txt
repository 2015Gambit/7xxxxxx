I Escaped a Cult
Imagine a world where you weren't free to do whatever you wanted - a world where someone else dictated how you should dress, think, feel and behave. This world is a reality for hundreds of people who belong to religious cults, where their leaders - or 'prophets'- control everything from what they believe in to whom they marry. I Escaped The Cult takes an in-depth look at life inside some cults with extreme beliefs For example meet members of a church where polygamy is insisted upon and a man can have dozens of wives; the followers who are sleep deprived, overworked and isolated from the rest of the world; and learn about the girl who watched her mother being forced to live in a shed for 'idolising her children. This probing show takes viewers on a journey to reveal the stories of courageous people who escaped the clutches of abuse, mind control and fear from these dangerous groups..
