[T],3R01,2012-09-07T13:01Z,"@JaySean23, Follow this steps to make the game work : (after installing the game)
-Open the Crack folder and copy all the file.
-Right click on your game icon on desktop and select 'Open file location' 
-Paste the file that you copy from Crack folder.
-Start the game ;)
PS: If you dont have a icon of the game on the desktop, find the game directory folder from My computer, local disc C, program files ect (When you install the game)"
