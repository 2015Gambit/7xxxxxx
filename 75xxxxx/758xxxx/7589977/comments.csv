Can you explain the problem better so i will help you?"
,coolblue123,2012-09-01T17:48Z,"Everything else works fine. The music plays, I can turn on 3D surround and use presets.

However I am unable to move the sliders to my desired values. Like for example I can't move #D surround to 10 from the default of 2. Clicking the slider and dragging doesn't work.

I have no idea if this is an issue on my computer or on the software itself..."

You must first activate DFX to can turn on 3D Sorround"
