In the black depths of the ocean, a discovery has been made - one with the potential to change the future of humankind - and unleash mortal danger for those who know of its existence. Now, Haley Walthers is on the run. Her friend and mentor, Ben Anderson, is missing, and the one man she hoped never to see again is the only man who can help her. Sam Wintripp is a former covert operative whose shadowy past has trained him to be as lethal as anyone he's up against. Together, they set out to find Ben - and learn the secret that a soulless corporate syndicate will do anything to possess. With a merciless enemy closing in, Haley and Sam must prevail in a brutal race through a vast wilderness. Against all odds, they'll risk everything to secure the extraordinary finding that, in the wrong hands, could wreak untold devastation, starting with the Pacific Northwest - and ending with the world.
