Description

Experience the most realistic, challenging, and immersive air-combat simulation you can get!

The classic air combat simulation comes to Mac! Pilot three different variants of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the best multi-role fighter ever built. Engage the enemy in the skies over North Korea or The Balkans, each covering over a million square kilometers of territory. High-fidelity flight physics, ultra-realistic cockpit instrumentation, and legendary dynamic campaign engine make Falcon 4.0: Allied Force singular among combat flight simulations.

Simulate an entire war with the most advanced dynamic campaign engine ever made for your computer. This remarkable feature presides over tens of thousands of vehicles; air, land and sea. No two missions ever fly the same!

Unleash real-world weapons including air-to-air missiles like the AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder. Deploy a vast array of air-to-ground weaponry including the AGM-65 Maverick, AGM-88 HARM, cluster bombs, slick and high drag bombs and laser-guided ordnance.
