Dance Like Nobody's Watching is a six-track EP released by American ska/pop band Suburban Legends, released on May 12, 2006. The EP signaled a drastic change in the band's sound, which also followed major lineup changes following the departure of lead vocalist Tim Maurer and trumpet player Aaron Bertram, and the untimely death of trombonist Ryan Dallas Cook. The band's previous release, Rump Shaker, was a poppy ska punk release, whereas Dance Like Nobody's Watching largely abandoned the ska influence in favor of a funk/disco-influenced sound, which would feature heavily in their following release, Infectious in 2007, and somewhat on 2008's Let's Be Friends, which featured a few ska tracks. The sudden genre change alienated some of the band's fanbase. This genre change was largely abandoned in favor of the band's original ska-influenced style with the release of Going on Tour in 2010 and Day Job in 2012.
The EP's first five tracks are all-new, funk/disco-influenced pop rock, with a soft, melancholy piano rock version of "Bright Spring Morning," a track from the group's 2003 album, Rump Shaker. This version of the song was first performed at the band's October 28, 2005, performance at iMusicast in Oakland, the first show after trombonist Ryan Dallas Cook's death.
The band performed "Come Back Home" on G4's Attack of the Show! on April 28, 2006, in promotion of the EP.
