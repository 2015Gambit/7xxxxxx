Just do not have much bandwidth living in africa, it is like the freakin dark ages here man. Thanks for your awesome uploads, all of your softwares have been clean and working so far. Legendary bro. You make a poor mans day with your stuff."

,chop007,2012-09-02T14:19Z,"No in fact it does not serve me well. What will serve me well and others is if your uploads improve in quality, i.e. not 6 million years old. Oh yes, and maybe you could actually provide shit that works. I suppose you are starting so please excuse my rudeness I am just full of crap sometimes. Thanks anyways bro."
