NetworkSleuth - Quickly find your files across a Network !
NetworkSleuth is a network file searching utility, that allows you to quickly locate files across a network. You can search for specific file names or for specific file types (e.g. all MP3 files).

NetworkSleuth provides a lightning fast search engine and includes the ability to search hidden network resources, restricted access resources, IP subnets and much more. It comes with a built-in password manager to store your network logins for resources with restricted access.

NetworkSleuth can scan hidden resources and automatically login to restricted shares, using the provided login information. The found files can be copied, moved etc. just as if you were working with Windows Explorer.

NetworkSleuth also enables you to schedule search tasks to be executed automatically. Additional features include result sorting, filtering, search within results, minimize to tray, scanning inside zip files and exporting of results to TXT, HTML and CSV format.
