This is the last disk of the region 2 version of tour of duty. The disk is untouched and with the original music from the series on tv in the 80s.
I will seeding this till someone have it completed. The upload speed is 150 kb/s so be patient when downloading the dvd.
If someone want to add subs or transcode to mkv (x264) be my quest. My pc is to slow for that at the moment.
Enjoy this box set!!!
