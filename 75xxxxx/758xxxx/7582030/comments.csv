,Infamousxzero,2012-08-30T13:40Z,No specials? still gonna download anyway. good series. thanks for the upload. BTW more seeds please lol
,Lost_Leaf,2012-08-30T18:53Z,"Ohh, thanks Daman. Was wondering when this would show up online.

Seeding the crap out of this to get it started for everyone, and FMA:B BD as that seems to be one of your more leech prone torrents.

I heard Persona 4: The Animation is being released on Blu-Ray in English Dub on the 20th of September. Do you think it's likely you'll end up posting it on here once it's out? Good series."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-30T21:21Z,yea Persona 4 will be out the min it reaches my Hands
,frost121,2012-08-30T23:09Z,"Could you upload this is 720p please? I'd greatly appreciate it, Thanks. =) "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-31T01:44Z,Frost it does not matter if its 720p or 1080p since this is an upscale by Funimation. it looks about 10% better than a DVD. so overall is the same thing.
,frost121,2012-08-31T06:04Z,"Yeah, I know. Reason why I asked was because my old ass computer can't keep up with all of the pixels. The best it can run is 720, but thanks anyways. =)"
,bangurdd,2012-09-02T23:24Z,"yet another great upload Daman4Iife, thanks again! will be seeding this one for awhile."
,bangurdd,2012-09-04T04:35Z,"Weird, I'm using MPC and still getting slightly laggy playback at time, as well as random audio cutting out. Are their any specific changes to MPC setting that might help around this? TIA."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-04T06:09Z,"banguard, its lagging because your Computer cannot process the 1920x1080p resolution."
,bangurdd,2012-09-04T10:02Z,"That's what I figured, I am on my netbook for traveling after all. Thanks for everything."
,Link-sama,2012-09-06T07:26Z,Hey Daman is there any possibility that you could upload Claymore??
,darinl1979,2012-09-06T23:42Z,"The picture of each file is nothing but green for me, sound is fine.  Playing them on VLC player,  anyone have any suggestions?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-07T01:35Z,"Darin, The files are 10bit so either download the latest VLC or Download K-lite Codecs/MPC"
,darinl1979,2012-09-09T03:24Z,"Daman4Iife,
I updated VLC and the files work now  thanks."
