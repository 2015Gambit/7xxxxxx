,Inkmaster3,2012-09-04T17:43Z,"Key is not working after a while

But hereÂ´s the trick:
Update quickly after using the key
if you get a warning that your licence is invalid
delete the old and folow the 4-10 point instruction
once it is activated again go to settings and use 
manually update unmark the default update url add a fake url and save settings

everytime you need to update just go to settings and temporarly use the genuin url to update then quick set it back to the fake one."
