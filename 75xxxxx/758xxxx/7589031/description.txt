Cool new toys:

FLV Extract 1.6.2
DVBPortal MP4Muxer 0.9.3.0

And old favorites:

MP4Cam2AVI 2.98
AtomicParsley win32-0.9.0 {not used in these examples}
VirtualDub 1.(whatever floats your boat)

Container changes galore!

Here's *.FLV <demux> *.264 + *.AAC <remux> *.MP4 <CC2AVI> *.AVI {W/MP3}

And all COMPLETELY lossless!

Many current FLV files are x264/AAC
The ones I've tried so far show a frame rate of 25.
The real frame rate is 29.970
So, I use VirtualDub 1.4.13 (had a bad audio experience with 1.5),
But any version should work just fine.

Run FLVExtract
drop FLV file onto it & wait for the green check mark.
Run MP4Muxer
add *.264
add *.AAC
hit "multiplex"
Run MP4Cam2AVI
recommend convert audio to MP3 (VLC can't find AAC in AVI)
select file in left pane, press "Start" in lower right
returns "videoOut.avi" - can't do the name, but retains time/date stamp
Run VirtualDub - set video to "direct stream copy"
Video - Frame Rate - Change to - 29.970
Save as <filename>.AVI

Tada! you now have an AVI, just like the Goddess of all reality intended!
