,nickwafu,2012-08-31T21:29Z,"so, to cut the story short, this torrent is a new game installer but patched from 1.5 version. am i right??? answer me guy please"
,RGOctavian,2012-08-31T21:48Z,"Why on earth skidrow uses techniques that are seen as viruses! I know is a fals positive but still, my heart has a sock when the antivirus pops up!"
,stegman,2012-08-31T22:34Z,"@nickwafu

NO, these are JUST the 'Update 1.5' files.
You can't do anything with them if you don't have an original Sleeping Dogs -SKIDROW game (9.16 GB).
Sorry."
,sobo100,2012-08-31T22:49Z,"This is Steam and SquareEnixâs effort to stop piracy
steam now patches original files instead of downloading it again
so 125MB update data split on all game files=7GB new files
no way to overcome this unless someone figures how to repack game files with the new data, 180mb updated files like 6gb so faster but no better for us is to send new files then file bat who will rebiuld for us this filesâŚ so nothing is perfect, but when all have 100mb bandwitch thsi is easy to DL and make game update =D"
,929112473,2012-08-31T22:58Z,Could had zipped this one. Org scene release is 3gb (Zipped) So that's a big deal.

,nerdiee,2012-09-01T18:52Z,"Why doesn't this update work?!
