And I do have a request or two...
There are scans of Baker Street and Ms Tree available, but they aren't very complete.  Do you have those books?"

Unfortunately, the only Baker Street stuff I have is what I got from jormis29's seed...

It's on my check list, though, so I do look around for it pretty regularly. If I find anymore I'll seed it."
