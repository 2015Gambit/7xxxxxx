[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-30T00:14Z,"Yeah, it says there's only .970 of it available, which means the download will never finish. Not until it gets to to 1.0, anyway."
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-30T01:30Z,Yep. Everyone stuck at 97%.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-30T04:46Z,I'm gonna bow out on this one. The uploader should be more cognizant in regards to what is happening to his seeds. 209 leechers and everybody is stuck at 97%. I'll get this one later.
