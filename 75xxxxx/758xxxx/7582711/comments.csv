[T],CAPTAIN7SS,2012-08-30T02:58Z,late today because my u-torrent crashed....and i could not get it going...re-installed it...several times...not responding...u-torrent never crashes...that's why it is what it is...this was a new experience...had to go to an even older version....maybe the list of torrents was too long...deleted a bunch...just don't know !!??!!
