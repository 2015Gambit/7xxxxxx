,cybergodsig,2012-08-31T18:37Z,My Aol dial up connection barely spits out bandwidth.
[T],rjordan21,2012-09-01T17:40Z,"^^^ if that's the case fully seed a torrent before uploading any more and use the correct trackers.  If you don't know what they are, after you upload click ""GET THIS TORRENT"" and the correct trackers will auto populate...."
