What's new in version 7
•Paragraph Text Editing. Edit text right in the copy of the paragraph, without converting to Microsoft® Word® or a text editor — just like you would in a word processing application. Edit words and lines of text within paragraphs, reformat, realign, reflow, and adjust text attributes without leaving your PDF document.
•Signature Profiles. Create profiles for rapid application of your digital signature. This is a huge timesaver when having to sign the same PDF multiple times.
•Stamp Signature. Digitally apply or “stamp” your signature to a page so it looks as natural as pen and paper. Itâ™s as simple as the click of a button.
•Integrated, High-Performance Renderer. An enhanced renderer delivers greater performance and increased quality. Enjoy crisper text, more accurate and faster rendering of vector art and CAD drawings, more responsive editing, zooming, scrolling, and more.
•Redaction. Now you can search for, identify, and permanently remove sensitive or private text and images from documents.
