Autorickshaw driver Amal is content with the small, but vital, role he serves - driving customers around New Delhi as quickly and safely as possible. But his sense of duty is tested by an eccentric, aging billionaire, who, moved by Amal's humility, bequeaths him his entire estate before passing away. With only one month to discover and claim the inheritance, Amal's struggles with duty and wealth are threatened by all those around him - from a young injured beggar girl and a lovely store merchant, to the danger of the old man's upper-caste friends and siblings, all seeking to claim their share of the riches.

New Delhi-based Amal Kumar lives a poor lifestyle along with his widowed mother, Radha, and drives a three-wheeled auto rickshaw for a living, fully aware that his livelihood is threatened by the soon-to-be commissioned Metro. He is kind, honest, compassionate and generous to a fault, even decides to sell his auto to pay for the surgery of a homeless girl, Priya, who stole from his passenger, Pooja Seth, and takes up a job in a post office. Amal does not know that he has been chosen to be the sole heir by a deceased eccentric millionaire, G.K. Jayaram, and also does not know that Jayaram's children, as well as others, will leave no stone unturned to ensure that Amal does not get a single Paisa. Written by rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)
