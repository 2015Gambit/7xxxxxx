Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Friday, August 31 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts the heated rhetoric swirling around the RNC and the brazen attempt by the establishment and its corporate media attack dogs to criminalize political speech by labeling words such as "Chicago" and "birth certificate" as racist. 

Alex also talks about the increasing number of military drills across America as the elite gear up for social in political chaos in the event of an economic implosion. 

On today's worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer, author of Operation Dark Heart, a book destroyed by the Pentagon, and 

Congressman Walter B. Jones, who introduced House Concurrent Resolution 107, calling for the impeachment of Obama if he attacks Iran or Syria without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress.
