Bandini | 1963 | Bimal Roy Hindi Classic | XviD | MP3 | Phantom

Bandini is a 1963 film directed and produced by Bimal Roy, the man who directed classics like Do Bigha Zameen and Devdas. Bandini stars Nutan giving one of her career's finest performances, along with Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra as leads, and explores the human conflicts of love and hate intertwined in the mind of Kalyani (Nutan). The movie tells the story of Kalyani, the all suffering, selfless, sacrificing, and strong yet weak Indian woman. She must make a choice between two very different men, Devendra (Dharmendra), the loving prison doctor, and Bikash (Ashok Kumar), a man from her past.

Bandini was the tenth highest grosser of 1963 and was declared a 'Semi Hit' at the Indian Box Office, though it received not just critical acclaim but also sweeped that year's Filmfare Awards, winning six awards in all including the top awards of Best Film and Best Director, as well as Best Actress, and is still considered a landmark movie of the 1960s, especially being last directorial venture of Bimal Roy, a master of realism.
