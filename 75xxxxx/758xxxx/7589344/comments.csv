,jamespoos,2012-09-03T04:56Z,"hello the frame rate on your videos is wrong it should be 23.976fps also the audio Hz are wrong it should not be 44100Hz it should be 48000Hz

also if you want to do hq videos encodes around 150mb try this app

http://sourceforge.net/projects/handbrake/files/0.9.8/HandBrake-0.9.8-i686-Win_GUI.exe/download

i still love your rips but i thought you would like some input to make your videos even better"
