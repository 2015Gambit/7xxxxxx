Just as owning a lot of telephone books won't make anyone you call talk any faster on the phone, listing many trackers in your torrent files won't speed up anyone's data transfers.
For torrents that you plan to upload to The Pirate Bay, you do not need to include any trackers at all, since the system automatically edits the tracker list in each uploaded torrent file to use the trackers of our choice.

Tracker mongers, the guys who collect long lists of trackers, do so because they don't have a proper understanding of how the bit torrent protocol actually works.

Trackers have basically been obsolete ever since the DHT (Distributed Hash Table) capable bit torrent clients were released. "
