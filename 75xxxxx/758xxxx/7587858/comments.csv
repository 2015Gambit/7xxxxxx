In the ""Presets"" box to the left, I get ""Pro_Shaders"" (a blue folder) and ""Pro_Shaders_maps"". If I click the blue folder, it says that it's unregistered. If I go into the Pro_Shaders_maps"" folder, I get the materials with the jpgs applied, however, they don't have any other settings applied - everything is just the default. Is this what everybody else is getting?"

Full pro shader pack desired, please."
