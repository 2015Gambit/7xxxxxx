Cyber metal lyrically is about science-fiction but more about "the real" science fiction, anticipation visions, human overwhelmed by new technologies, relationship between machine and men, decay, etc. Atmospher of music is unique: melancholic, dark, futuristic, pessimistic, apocalyptic and cold with aggressive touches... There is many EBM/Industrial influences with harsh cold rifs, digital sounding guitars and dezhumanized or synthetic voice. Listen this compilation and I'm convinced that you will feel it...
