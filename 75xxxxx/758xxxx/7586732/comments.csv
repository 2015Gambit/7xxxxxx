If you like ""12-20 GB version with fantastic quality."" look somewhere else.
I only do ""4-6 GB version with fantastic quality."" so ignore my torrents in the future.
Besides why so picky Bangladeshi boi? How big is your screen (I wonder) and what about your upload speed LOL, or you were thinking to just download without uploading? Pathetic."

I'm not so ""picky"". Just asked you if you could upload at that size, and I didn't demean your effort.
I have a screen sized at 52"" (Sony), I guess you have much bigger screen than this.
And I'm from Bangladesh and live in Texas. My internet speed is around 50 mbps ( I guess you have better one), and when I visited BD, found out that 2mbps+ net connections are readily available. 
You have a serious problem, that I found you attack people personally. don't do that. 
By the way, where are you from?   "
