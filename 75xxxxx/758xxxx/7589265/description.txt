"Dead End Kings is about the corridors of our mind from where there is no return. Be a king or queen in your own right in
these hallways, even at the dead end. Carry your burden
with pride. ThatΓÇÖs what we are doing, twenty years and
counting. Kings, because we believe in what we are
creating, in our own disturbing faith."
ΓÇö Jonas Renkse
