,agekindly,2012-09-01T19:55Z,Holy Shit! I have literally been checking for these two episodes everyday all over the web knowing that you would some day pop up after the death of demonoid and the day has come! Much appreciation for your efforts sir Im sure you've heard it quite a bit but you are the only one save for itunes&amazon to have The eric andre show on this whole web.Something is wrong with that! Thanks again and A-10 V-10 like always

The same as the first commenter. I've been looking for these episodes everyday in millions of places... I almost broke down and bought them on Amazon...  good thing I didn't.

THANKS SO FUCKING MUCH. YOU ARE THE SHIT."
