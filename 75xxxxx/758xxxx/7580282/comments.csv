,jasonkingsley20,2012-08-29T16:19Z,"So, I've downloaded the JeppFD App from the store. I don't have a serial so I can't activate. JeppFD tells me that there is an update available but I can't download the update as it first wants me to enter the serial. I've copied the Documents folder to User Apps/JeppFD/Documets (which was empty) but then I run the App in Demo mode I can see for example European airports but when I want to look at a approach plate I get the ""There is a problem with the database"" error or something like that. Could someone please explain to me how to install the Database correctly?"
