I found B_Cereus's copy of DIT 2012 (Brilliant upload), and found a few of the videos couldn't be played. I downloaded copies of these videos from another site, and am uploading them.

For those interested in a study guide, an anonymous user has already put up the .pdf, which is also very useful.

For people downloading the videos I am uploading, please note one thing: although  my internet speed is the maximum my country offers, it is significantly slower than those of  many other countries. Please bear with me through the process. If any others have a better speed, and have copies of the videos already, please share.

Happy stepping everyone.
