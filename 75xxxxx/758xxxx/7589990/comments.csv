,roddisII,2012-09-04T15:51Z,Can you upload this in flac?
,mikedean1950,2012-09-05T10:14Z,"Great album thanks very much, very fast download and the quality is very good, thanks."
,sapo_joe,2012-09-09T00:09Z,"Great, but aren't the iTunes tracks supposed to be in .M4A?

I'd rather have them in the original format, converting a lossy format to another one (and a worse one) is not so good.

But thanks anyway, I'm very curious to hear this!"
,l3endik,2012-09-10T16:12Z,Contact me at Kat for .m4a's.
,sapo_joe,2012-09-12T02:27Z,"Thanks buddy, I ended up getting a FLAC download and, when putting the music on my iPod, converted it to 256kbps m4a, as needed.


M4A should pretty much be the standard these days, since it adresses much of the quality problems the MP3 format has."
