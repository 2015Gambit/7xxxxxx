- You need a SDCARD with at least 1.5 GB of free space.
- There is a MASSIVE 1GB additional data download to complete the installation so WIFI is "ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY" and a good dose of patience too, the installation may take from 30mn to 60mn to complete based on your Internet network configuration and/or our servers congestion, everybody will be served but please be patient.
-There is an "in-game" FAQ in case you have some trouble during the installation so please take the time to read it should you have problems.
-Game is set, by default, to use the HIGHEST resolution available so please adjust in the option screen should your device be a little "just" to support the full hires data.
-A High-End device is highly recommended for the best gaming experience however the game is fully enjoyable from Nexus1 or similar type of device. There is a pre-hardware check in the game before allowing the 1GB download so those with hardware not yet supported should be able to refund within the actual refund window.
