,Geep21,2012-08-30T14:39Z,"thx for uploading so fast! :)
but im having a problem with the lucky patcher.

wen i try to remove the license from the 3 auto modes the best % i can get is the ""extreme auto mode"" and i get 85.0%
and i see that one of the patch the ""n6"" failed.
I try to install it and wen i get around (3000) it says that my wi-fi might have a problem but it works... and then restarts form (6000)

if you can help me i appreciate."

First you must install the apk of course.Then use the latesy lucky patcher and do the auto patch the one that i said in the txt.You must get 99% success.Then you open the wifi and the open the game and let it download the data.You need a free space of 1.4gb for the data to your sd card"

,Geep21,2012-08-30T20:17Z,"it look easy, download install the 2 apk open lucky patcher go to ""game icon"" ""open menu of patches"" ""remove license verification!"" ""auto mode!""

Can you try it in an other android version and other phone to see if it works too?Because maybe the problem is in your phone.After i will upload one other version of this game.You can try it too.Stay tuned."
,Geep21,2012-08-31T00:47Z,"I really don't have another phone to test it but yea it must be my phone because it works for a lot of ppl.
i will try the other version to see if it works.
Thx for all the support."
