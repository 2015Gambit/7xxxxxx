The terminal charts update with each cycle free of problems BUT the Jeppesen Navdata is stuck in the 2-2012  Expired since March 8.....  

I really attempted everything to solve this problem with absolutely no luck.

Any help from the fellow pilots will be highly appreciated."

Any chance to up the airportlist.dbf for cycle 1218????
This could probably help to update and display VFR Approach charts on Jeppview PC."
