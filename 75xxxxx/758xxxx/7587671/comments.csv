,lockedup1,2012-09-02T03:51Z,Full Season 6 720p WEB-DL pack in addition to a re-encode pack (this time without any encoding errors) will be uploaded once the missing episodes are out on iTunes. Currently missing episode 14 for some odd reason it's not showing up.

,DerSpiegel64,2012-09-04T05:22Z,"Ar718 is right.  So fast forward exactly 22 minutes to watch it from the start.  Doing this will also skip the opening preview which every Locked Up Abroad episode has but that I hate because it gives away too much about what's going to happen in the show.  So after the 45 minute mark, then go back to the start to watch the second half of the show."
