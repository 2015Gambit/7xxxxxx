,stuart0305,2012-08-29T18:11Z,"This file makes Windows Explore stop working. Windows then proceeds to check for a solution and then it restarts. Anybody know wtf is wrong?

It's probably just me and not the movie but it's happened twice before with two other downloaded movies (Hanna and The Fall)and I can't get rid of the files, because... everytime I get near them, they make Windows Explore stop working.

,simon200,2012-08-29T19:22Z,"@stuart0305 
WMP will always freeze when playing a mkv file, you need to DL vlc player and this will play fine for you"
,stuart0305,2012-08-29T19:53Z,"It's not the player that crashes (I use KMPlayer btw), it's Windows that crashes."
,stuart0305,2012-08-29T20:06Z,Never mind. I fixed it. It's the thumbnail display in Windows that has to be changed to icons and never thumbnails. Apparently this makes windows crash sometimes. 
,buck3th3ad,2012-08-29T21:20Z,SEED PPL .... SEEEEEEEED ... noticed that like small portion of top and bottom of the movie is missing so .... why would you crop the dvd release ??? i know stupid but it's just a question ... i'm using VLC

hard coded fucking subs"
,qqq12345,2012-08-30T15:31Z,why does the stupid korean always hardcode the stupid korean subtitle? 
,OutonaLimb,2012-08-30T16:13Z,This is not even out on DVD yet 
,originalKL,2012-08-30T18:55Z,"Video and audio are both 10's.
Yes, Korean subtitles are hardcoded.  
To the complaining douchebags above who have exactly 0 uploads to their name, I imagine it's because that's either how they got the film or it's because they live in Korea and don't really give a fuck what you think.  "
,bohrio,2012-08-30T23:15Z,"@originalKL you mean like yourself? I am not being negative but the video is laggy. It could be due to the player or the codec I dont know but it is laggy. And yes I am using VLC. I will try on my MAC and report back but is definetively not a 10, at least for me. People appreciate uploaders so this is not trolling just merely informing the rest. Thanks for the upload anyway!

,newline1,2012-08-31T11:11Z,"if A/V are less than 10 then it doesn't worth to download, i will wait for reall 1080p, "
,truthy,2012-08-31T17:56Z,"thx for sharing!

the video IS stuttering slightly all the time and it's a little bit too dark but ok all in all - definitely not 10 for a HDTV source. could be the encoding was done using a slow/old pc/cpu which can lead to that kind of stuttering.

some better screens: http://www.shotpix.com/images/72297963583402960215.jpg"

,sherrypizza,2012-08-31T21:55Z,Plus it lags and video is quite dark.
,agentspy,2012-09-01T01:41Z,"A10/V9 The only reason the video isn't a 10 is because of the hard coded Korean subs 
and the number 15 shows up from time to time in the upper right corner. Other than that it's a great copy."
,dlf72,2012-09-01T03:30Z,k-lite codecs with Gom player.
,oldbreadbutt,2012-09-01T13:33Z,"nothing inherently wrong with hardcoded korean subs, but they should be mentioned in the post title, or at the very least in the description."

,matheusafonso,2012-09-06T16:47Z,"you should mentioned that the video has korean subs, it's hard to watch, because I need to put my portuguese subs on it, for my family watch, and with two subs it get really mess, besides the video is a lit bit laggy. but thanks anyway."
