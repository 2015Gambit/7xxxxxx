,unscarred786,2012-08-31T08:00Z,What the fuck is your problem?
,RumInMyHand,2012-08-31T09:15Z,"Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City. 
aka BIOHAZARD"
,lyriksz,2012-08-31T09:17Z,Game work fine in my PC! Win 7 x 64 =) Thz for upload!! +1 rep
,NexiumCore,2012-08-31T15:33Z,"@RumInMyHand I have no idea which game this really is, but BIOHAZARD is what resident evil is know as in Asian countries. Example: Biohazard 1, Biohazard 2, Biohazard 3: Nemesis. Both you and 90% of the internet need to stop commenting when you have no idea what they are talking about. "
,whateverthefuck,2012-09-03T20:51Z,"""Biohazard 2012"", and the description being a copy/paste of a negative review of the upload, casts a shadow of doubt upon the legitimacy of this torrent."
