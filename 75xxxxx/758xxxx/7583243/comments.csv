,camin432,2012-09-01T19:08Z,its ok qualiti. can you pls upload new ice road truckers on this monday. Looks like no one else would. 
,vivatpb5776,2012-09-02T02:41Z,"@Masterzilla - I'm sorry man but you are obviously not searching correctly. The day before you posted your message, another uploader uploaded this .torrent:

thepiratebay.se/torrent/7581956/Ice.Road.Truckers.S06E13.Cold-Blooded.HQRip.x264-XS.mp4

The quality of that .torrent is 720*400 versus 640*360 for this one. If you are that concerned, just go and download the other one."
[V],Masterzilla,2012-09-02T22:16Z,That's the source I've used. and XviD format supported by ALL DivX standalone players is 640*360. that's why I use that resolution.
