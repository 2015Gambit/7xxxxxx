,bleslie1,2012-08-31T20:55Z,"Thanks, again :)

I was really tired of the Hope/Steffy/Liam triangle, but I'm starting to get back into it. I like how they're incorporating the other relationships of the younger crowd into the mix more now. Spices things up :)

I never liked Thomas with Hope last year... I can't get over the fact that, even though they aren't TECHNICALLY related, they call the same man Dad... I wish he would just stay with Caroline.. They're good together"
,jamespoos,2012-09-03T05:14Z,"hello the frame rate on your videos is wrong it should be 23.976fps also the audio Hz are wrong it should not be 44100Hz it should be 48000Hz

also if you want to do hq videos encodes around 150mb try this app

http://sourceforge.net/projects/handbrake/files/0.9.8/HandBrake-0.9.8-i686-Win_GUI.exe/download

i still love your rips but i thought you would like some input to make your videos even better "
