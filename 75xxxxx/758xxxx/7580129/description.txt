 deadmau5's The Veldt (8 Minute Edit) is one of the newest tracks in 2012 that he made (correct me if I'm wrong), it was created live via webcam and many viewers got to see how he makes his music (for the most part), the lyrics were actually made by one of his fans that he decided to contact and use them. It's a unique song, unlike his other awesome tracks.
