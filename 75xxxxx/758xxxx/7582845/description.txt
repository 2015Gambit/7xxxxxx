That's Life!
Test your memory, test your listening

Read and listen to the That's Life! story from your Student's book again, and test your memory and your listening.

For every episode of the story, you can:

   - Test your memory and your reading.
   - Print the story with gaps.
   - Read, and guess the missing words.
   - Listen to the story audio.
   - Print the complete story, to check your answers.
