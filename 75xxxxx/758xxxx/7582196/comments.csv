,EliteBeast,2012-08-30T18:52Z,For any Americans getting this one I will warn you. This is a EuroTrash movie. American made movies are way more better 99% percent of the time.
,vampzcore,2012-08-31T06:52Z,thanks!!
,FatMarauder,2012-08-31T10:59Z,sooo the rating would be -10 to the movie then?:/
,Jamstand,2012-08-31T17:24Z,"@EliteBeast
The only trash here is that dribble spewing out of your fat hole you call a mouth. America happens to take 1st. place for shite movies with their cocaine coma washed up actors who are still trying make a buck and keep their untalented arses off the streets. It is truly amazing how ignorant you US citizens are. PS. go blow a goat ya filthy git."

,Rush,2012-08-31T21:08Z,"I cant speak that much about European movies, but being an American, I have to agree there are some royal pieces of shit coming out of Hollyweird. 
That being said the vast majority of the top money makers are obviously American. 
There are just too many studios trying to break into the market here and keep throwing shit on the wall until something sticks
