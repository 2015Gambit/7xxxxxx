Rage of Mages II - Necromancer OR RAGE2 (ENGLISH)
-----------------------------------------------------
Sorry for not spelling 100% correctly. English is my second language.
 
A friend to me found this old game on his old server hard-drive.
And i can't find a good or alive torrent of this game, so i uploading this one.
i have Win7, and cant install it to 100%, setup is crashing at 99%, but it's playable even if the setup is crashing then it's almost done.
i have even tried to install it on a virtuel pc (win xp) but same results.
maybe my computer just is cupid :)
