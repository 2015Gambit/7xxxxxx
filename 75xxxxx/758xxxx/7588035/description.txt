Science Documentary hosted by Dallas Campbell, published by BBC in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

For years our place in the universe was the subject of theologians and philosophers, but in 1960 scientist Frank Drake changed all that by using a radio telescope to search for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence. Although the project resulted in silence, it led to one of the most seminal equations in science - the Drake Equation - which examined seven key elements necessary for ET intelligence to exist. To find out about the equation's influence, Dallas Campbell meets the scientists who have dedicated their lives to focusing on its different aspects.
