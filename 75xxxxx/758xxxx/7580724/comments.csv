,BruceWayneJr,2012-08-29T14:38Z,"Thanks for keeping the comics coming, Leonard. We're starting to build up a nice little collection.

Can I make a request? I'm reading thru Astro City again, but I can't find Dark Age Book Four or some of the one-shots/specials that came out towards the end of the series, like Silver Agent and Astra. 

There's no complete collection on any of the torrent sites, so maybe you can help out there? I appreciate it!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-29T19:52Z,"Hey Jr., yeah, I have those.

 I took a look at this...

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5048773/Astro_City

...and it appears that the only things not in that torrent are 'Astro City Special - Astra' and 'Astro City - The Dark Age Book Four'.  Is that what you're looking for?"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-29T19:59Z,"Regarding where to get comic books, well, first of all, I have scanned some of these myself because I do still collect physical copies of the stuff I like.

Also, I used btjunkie A LOT for a long time, because it would return search results for files WITHIN a torrent. That's the only thing I find lacking about TPB. I've also been using TPB for a long time, and there's actually quite a bit more here than it looks like sometimes, but you can't always see it unless you do some creative searching and dig through the contents of larger torrents.

Lastly, SLSK! SLSK has had a thriving comic book sharing community for years. Yeah, it takes a little longer to get what you're looking for (sometimes much longer). But it's free! So no complaints. The trick at SLSK is to search for whatever you're looking for with cbr at the end, then search again with cbz at the end.

So, something like...

Peter Bagge cbr

Peter Bagge cbz

Or...

Astro City cbr

Astro City cbz

Hope that helps

In case I wasn't totally clear about it, I'm waiting for you to confirm that those are the books you're looking for before I upload them. Peace."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-08-31T07:17Z,"Hey, sorry I didn't get back here sooner. Those are exactly what I'm missing, and what torrents I have found with them just aren't seeded at all. If you could help me out with those few issues, I'd really really appreciate it. Thank you!"
,BruceWayneJr,2012-08-31T07:19Z,"Just to be clear, Silver Agent 1 and 2 aren't seeded anywhere either. Thanks again!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-02T00:10Z,"Well, I've got Silver Agent 1 now. Lets see how long it takes to find issue 2."
