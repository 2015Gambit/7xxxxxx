It is possible to use other languages from this DVD, but I have not tested them.
Past XP updates were language specific so I'm not sure if any of the kb files will break your languages.
I would not reccommend updating from XP using this DVD, but theoretically its possible.  I have not tested
the manual update from xp.

I have included instructions to make a usb flash drive installer of this, just use winrar or any program that can extract files from a .iso file to the usb drive then you get it all prepped. Read the text file in this directory if you prefer this method.

Do NOT download KB971033 - This is the anti-piracy crawler that searches your system.  If you accidently download this, refer to the web on how to fix it.  I have never downloaded it.

This install will be a bit slower than the normal win7ultsp1 install since it has the kb updates, directx updates, .net 4.5, and windows loader. (like 5mins longer)

Note that kb2533552 will still show up in windows update even after I integrated it. This seems to be a bug with the kb file, and it's a minor windows update hotfix. If it bothers you, feel free to download it with windows update again.

You need to reboot at least once after installing for the windows loader to bypass the activation.

I have made it a point not to modify or customize any windows programs or settings in any way.

Enjoy :)
