Originally broadcast online on 30 Aug 2012. Ripped from nicovideo.com with IDM, freed from the bondage of FLV by Quick Media Converter and Xvidded with VirtualDub x64. Vdub warned me about the VBR audio, but due to the original specs of the stream, changing it would have either caused bloat or bad quality. Please comment if you have issues.

Vocaloid music (PVs from Project Diva f) starts at 34:40; actual concert starts at 47:20. Most of the rest is the presenters, who resemble Megurine Luka and a fully male Yokune Ruko, hawking the new PSVita game Project Diva f. The female presenter draws a hideous chibi Miku face - be warned. After that they interview Crypton employees, project some PVs from Project Diva f, and finally start the concert proper.

This concert has only Miku, and a lot of effects. It was projected onto a screen of mist spray, and unfortunately, Miku looks translucent and blurry. The effects are nice, but overall, not the best concert, and certainly one of Miku's shortest performances.
