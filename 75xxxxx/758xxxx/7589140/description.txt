Kedarnath is a wealthy man with many enemies. One day, a taxi-driver, Dilher Singh, saves his life, but is killed instead. Kedarnath is grateful and is willing to look after Dilher's widow and son. But his enemies find out about this, and substitute a woman named Sheela and her son, Vikram, instead. The real widow is killed by them, and her son, Jimmy, is looked after by a kind-hearted poor man, Jaggu, and his son, Gulu, who make their living stealing and begging. Years later, Jimmy and Gulu have grown up but are still stealing. Jimmy, on the run from hoods, ends up in Delhi, impersonating Rakesh Rajpal, and meets with Jyoti and falls in love with her. Jyoti introduces him to her dad, none other than Kedarnath. It is here that the drama unfolds, bringing back past memories and crimes.
