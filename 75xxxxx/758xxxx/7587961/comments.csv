,heretocreep,2012-09-01T19:42Z,It says these are 320 kbps but they're obviously not. They sound like crap.
,justinmac13,2012-09-02T14:25Z,"I apologize if they sound bad its the best I could do with my current knowledge I really just recorded the songs off soundcloud with soundtap if you know of a better method please let me know but if not quit whining and go download it somewhere else :D
(it's funny cause there aren't any other downloads for this) :D"
