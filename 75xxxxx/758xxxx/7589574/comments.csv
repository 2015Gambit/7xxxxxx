,ingr.osei,2012-09-04T22:05Z, I HOPE SOMEONE GETS TO CRACK THIS EXE FILE FOR ALL ON THE BAY TO BENEFIT FROM.
,klyd971,2012-09-04T23:24Z,"Hi, 
1--Is it normal that my textures are all black?
2--In panel.cfg, ..prog looks for ..sys2.dll, not found.
3--do you get the exe?
thks"
,ingr.osei,2012-09-05T21:23Z,THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE.I UPLOADED AN UNCRACKED EXE FILE;HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO CRACK IT OR SOMETHING.WHY THOSE ERROR MESSAGES AND BLACK TEXTURES.ITS STRANGE ISN'T IT.
,klyd971,2012-09-05T23:03Z,"yeah, 
maybe it's my config...and i dont think that an uncracked blocks textures..."
,ingr.osei,2012-09-06T10:20Z,"@klyd971,did you you install the rip version that I uploaded last week.I think a lot of people have issues with that upload;please delete them if you have.Its rather ideal to try out a crack on this version.What do you think.Perhaps the CS loader will do the trick."
,ingr.osei,2012-09-06T14:41Z,"Funny World that we live in.because of this upload,I took a lot of insults from people like chugalugg and some other fellow who called me a nigerian fsx scammer,such a pity that people never put themselves in the shoes of others even for even a second just to know where it hurts most.right now I do not even feel at ease about uploading anything I have any longer;I feel that all I may get would be insults.the enthusiasim has waned."
,ingr.osei,2012-09-06T20:11Z,"klyd971 please try out the loader and lets see if it works,who knows."
,virtualanarchy,2012-09-09T05:20Z,"Seriously? Everyone is on your side.

Chuggalug or whatever is a faggot that no one likes. 

You're doing good. Keep it up!"
,ingr.osei,2012-09-11T17:24Z,"@Virtualanarchy,thanx a lot brother,I bought the qwsim bae 146,I have the installer and a friend has the crack for the gauges,should I upload,please let me have your opinion before I seed.thank you."
