One thing I want to say though is the really bad dynamic range the source cd has (DR 9). Maybe this would have been even better with a more decent source. Check out the Japanese first CD issue with DR 14. This CD does not need any treatment at all it sounds all fantastic. You just have to turn the volume knob 5 degrees to the right, and sitr back for an exeptional expirience. 

Your version sounds good too, but DR value are to low. The '94 remastered source CD is not the best source. Thanks."

,cybergodsig,2012-09-01T02:29Z,Do us all a favor and stop churning out this gaaaabidge.  People get the Japan CP35-3017 or the MFSL cd.
,hal4000,2012-09-03T14:12Z,Cybergodsig. Is that really you talking about garbage? Just shut up man and start finishing your  torrents first. Thanks beavis39 for your work.
