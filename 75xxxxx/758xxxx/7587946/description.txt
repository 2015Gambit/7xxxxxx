Navis is a comic about Navis childhood on her home planet, and are quite different from the main series. It is more comically drawn, more in the style of Little Spirou than Wake, and the stories are also more fitted for children, without the moral dilemmas and problems of the main series.
It can of course still be enjoyed by adults, I myself love it :)
