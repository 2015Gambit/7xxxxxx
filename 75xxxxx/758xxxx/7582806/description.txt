When Teddy signs up for volleyball, Coach Hammerstone gives her the nickname, T. Wrecks. Unfortunately, Teddy is too nice and can't relate to it, until Coach Hammerstone gives her advice which she takes too seriously and becomes overly aggressive. Meanwhile, Gabe tricks Amy into building his model rocket for his science class and Bob overstays his welcome at PJ and Emmett's apartment. Annoyed because Bob is infringing their privacy, PJ and Emmett try to kick him out.
