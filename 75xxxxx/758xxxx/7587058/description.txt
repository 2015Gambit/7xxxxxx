John Saul is at his terrifying best as he takes readers into the vast, dark 

labyrinth of tunnels beneath Manhattan, home to a bizarre collection of outcasts, 

and introduces a secret society that uses (and stocks) this underworld as a 

private hunting ground, with its residents as their prey. When twenty-one year 

old NYU student Jeff Converse is convicted of a brutal rape and murder that he 

did not commit, his nightmare has just begun. Jeff is just the latest innocent man 

to be made a target of the society that controls that underground hell - the 

Manhattan Hunt Club. A prestigious club near Wall Street, its membership 

includes many of the city's political and financial elite. Bored with more 

conventional sport, some of the MHC members can't resist secretly indulging their 

desire to hunt the most dangerous game in the world - humans.
