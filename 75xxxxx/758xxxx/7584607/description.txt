Storyline:

The life and work of filmmaker Mário Peixoto (1908-1992), the author of a single feature-length movie: the legendary "Limit" (1931), which many consider to be the greatest Brazilian movie of all times. The documentary shows rare file images, like the making of "Limit" and fragments of "Where the Earth Ends", an unfinished feature-length film by the filmmaker starring the Brazilian cinema diva of the '30s Carmen Santos. The sequences are narrated by actor Matheus Nachtergaele, based on the diaries of the filmmaker, and on an interview with Peixoto himself, where he tells of his studies in England, at the end of the '20s; the genesis of "Limit"; the experiences of creative cinematographer Edgar Brazil; the frustration regarding numerous undone projects; and the long retreat at Sítio do Morcego, in Ilha Grande, RJ. The film has interviews with actress Olga Brenno, from "Limit", of friends of the director, and of filmmakers Cacá Diegues, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Ruy Solberg and Walter Salles.
