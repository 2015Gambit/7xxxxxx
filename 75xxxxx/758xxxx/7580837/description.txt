I have been a RPG gamer for last 12 years.
This is my complete collection of all RPG published for DOS from 1979.
The List isn't complete probably, you may find few games missing here and there but this this is a pretty exhaustive list.

You need a emulator called DOSBox to run these games. (DOSBox works on Linux as well,means you can play these games on Linux too. yey!!) Few games may run on Windows as well.

Few notable omissions are (due to their huge size)

 Alien Logic: A Skyrealms of Jorune Adventure
 Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager
 Jagged Alliance
 Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games 	 	
 Albion
 Ravenloft: Stone Prophet

Please bring into my notice if any major exclusion, I shall up it in my next torrent.

Happy memories of childhood. 

Forget not to 
1. say thanks
2. more importantly, seed after you finish download.
