 deadmau5's HR Cephei 8938, a Progressive House song that has not really gained alot of attention despite being an overall awesome song. It caused a lot of potential problems for Astronomers who could not research this particular star (HR 8938).

 Obtained legitimately and is being shared with you for free.
