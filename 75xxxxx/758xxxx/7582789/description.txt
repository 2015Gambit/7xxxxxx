Scott's guests today:

Jay Lake, a Ron Paul delegate to the Republican National Convention

Craig Corey, father of American activist Rachel Corrie, who was crushed by an army bulldozer during a 2003 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Gaza. RachelΓÇÖs family had accused Israel of intentionally and unlawfully killing their 23-year-old daughter, launching a civil case in the northern Israeli city of Haifa after a military investigation had cleared the army of wrongdoing. In the ruling issued by the court yesterday, Judge Oded Gershon called CorrieΓÇÖs death a "regrettable accident," but said the state was not responsible because the incident had occurred during what he termed a war-time situation.
