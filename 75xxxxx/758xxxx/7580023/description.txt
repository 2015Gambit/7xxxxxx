Timid English teacher Mr. O'Neal has to deal with his seductive relationship with down and out math teacher Mrs. Richards. In the students case, you have high school sweethearts and virgins, David and Veronica. But things with David and Veronica turn stale when class beauty and cheerleader Marissa persuades David to be her boyfriend so she can make her ex-boyfriend, the dumb and cocky Richard, insanely jealous. This is David's chance to finally lose his virginity with Marissa but his pothead friends Patrick and Brian question if he should risk his relationship with Veronica.
