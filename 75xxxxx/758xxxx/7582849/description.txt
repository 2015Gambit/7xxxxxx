Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the news, including the latest on kidnapped and forcibly interned veteran Brandon Raub. He also covers efforts at the RNC to disenfranchise Ron Paul supporters and minimize their participation at the GOP dog and pony show currently underway in Tampa, Florida. On today's show, Alex talks with Steve Quayle, radio talk show host, photographer and author of several books, including Breathe No Evil, a primer for understanding bioterrorism. 

Alex also talks with Doug Hagmann, Director of Field Operations for the Northeast Intelligence Network, an anti-terrorist website developed in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.
