Information
------------------------------

Deep within the Iskut River Valley of British Columbia was one of the largest gold mines in North America - the Snip Gold Mine. The lack of roads and constant requirement for resupply warranted the use of air support to keep the mine running. But only those aircraft and pilots willing to handle the trials of asperous runways, choking terrain, and unforgiving weather could handle such a task. The only worthy aircraft were propliners of a bygone era: the robust Douglas Skymaster, the portly Bristol Freighter, the hardy DC-3, and the eccentric Aviation Traders Carvair. Come along for the ride to witness them conquer and claim the skies on one of their last crusades against time. Welcome to Bronson Creek!
