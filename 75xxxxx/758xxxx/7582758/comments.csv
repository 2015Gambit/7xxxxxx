Does anyone else find the cover causes an error with Acrobat (it's fine with all the other readers like Nitro, Nuance, Sumatra, etc)?"
,raymond_u,2012-08-30T19:10Z,Cheers thorhammer. I don't use Acrobat (I use the built in PDF viewer my Mac has) so I can't really comment on that.

 Thanks too raymond_u .  "
