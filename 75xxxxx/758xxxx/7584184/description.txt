There's a lot of other good Veitch stuff here at TPB, but I'm not 100% sure all of it is still being actively seeded. If anybody would like any of that other stuff and you're unable to download, just drop a comment and I'll seed it up.

Can't Get No is a graphic novel by Rick Veitch which concerns businessman Chad Roe's depression after the financial collapse of his business, his seemingly permanent full-body marker tattoos, and the September 11 attacks, which prompt Roe to take a road trip.

Can't Get No is unique for not only having no speech balloons, but for having captions only loosely related to the narrative. Most of the writing is, in fact, a long-verse poem that runs parallel to Roe's journey.

Another unique point of Can't Get No is the unusual shape of book, which wider than it is tall, creating a long landscape-style canvas that in turn affects the shape of the panels.
