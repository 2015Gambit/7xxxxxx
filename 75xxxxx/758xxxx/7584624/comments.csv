,Naberdy,2012-09-01T04:39Z,THIS IS IDENTICAL INFO JUST WITH A PASSWORD SLAPPED ON IT. DOES NOT WORK. Also fuck you uploader for wasting my time. I created an account just so I could warn other users from wasting their time too. The only thing you did was put a more recent copy of pinnacle with the same serial info THAT DOES NOT WORK. I hope your fucking crappy link bait blogspot site gets shut down.
,DrAwesomeO,2012-09-03T04:10Z,"Dude this isn't my blog site. And yeah it's just a more recent version. And gimme' a break it's my first torrent. At least i'm contributing to the Pirate Bay community. Moreover, just read the fucking instructions in the folder. So, in conclusion, suck a dick"
,DrAwesomeO,2012-09-03T04:11Z,it works fine for me btw -.- using a Logitech F710 controller

,giggedyguy,2012-09-05T12:20Z,Best to do a reup with either an easier password or none at all.  Thanks for this though. Works fine. Just better to make things simple.
,DrAwesomeO,2012-09-05T15:55Z,"yeah sorry for the relative complexity of it >.< the instructions make it easy, but it's a bit of steps. I would've made it easier, but I didn't make the files or anything. I just made it a torrent file and uploaded to share d:"
,stubbieaussi,2012-09-05T23:36Z,"If you have half a brain you can follow the instructions. It aint hard.
Works great. Thanks for uploading this DrAwesomeO."
,Wuterbear,2012-09-06T17:20Z,"Yeah, how are you guys even getting past the password part of set up? The password provided is too long to be entered correctly. Why even upload a file that is Password Protected and try calling it shared?"
,DrAwesomeO,2012-09-09T21:21Z,The password is to extract the WinRar files... herp. 
,ZombieWarez,2012-09-09T22:48Z,So how exactly do I get the password? And your torrent says its v6.4.5 but the link site says its 6.4.5 also but in the description it says its 6.1.4 and the actual pinnacle site says latest is 6.0.0 so whats the deal? whats the latest version?? anyone know?
