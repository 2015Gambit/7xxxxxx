,jrma3,2012-08-30T01:32Z,really?this is working fine 4 U?
,WJSS12,2012-08-30T01:34Z,"Nobody, yourself included is seeding."
,namco-nexgen,2012-08-30T01:36Z,"Thank you, i'll report once it finishes download and seed as usual."
,mosbach,2012-08-30T01:42Z,LOL
,Raptor05121,2012-08-30T02:20Z,"WJS, suck my cock. i live in the middle of fucking nowhere you ungrateful bastard. this is a RIP of my LEGIT PAID FOR install so stop your bitching"
,namco-nexgen,2012-08-30T03:26Z,Hmmm... You sure the RIP is complete? The exterior model (as well as the VC) lack textures or are transparent and i can't get the engine to start for nothing in this world.
,Raptor05121,2012-08-30T03:37Z,"Well if someone else chimes in and its not working, I'll pull this and just hope someone can crack it. I installed it to its own folder like someone asked so I at least did my part."
,737pilot7,2012-08-30T03:47Z,"Thanks for the upload, but as stated below, the both interior and exterior are transparent and engines will not start. Will it be possible to upload the ""exe."" file?
Thanks 737pilot7"
,Raptor05121,2012-08-30T04:09Z,"I can upload the .exe, but it requires serial and e-mail, of which i am not going to provide. Do you still want it?"
,Crash2701,2012-08-30T07:52Z,"Tanx 4 ur troubl'z but it ain't workin.
Had it tested by 3 different peeps, none got it to work'z
cheer'z"
,rapterman,2012-08-30T13:10Z,upload the exe 
,WJSS12,2012-08-30T14:58Z,"@Raptor05121
Its not bitching you retard. I am thankful for it. But the fact was, you, the original uploader, connection being good or not, was not seeding....so..you my friend can go suck a cock you retard. What are we suppose to fucking wish the files to our computers from yours?"
,737pilot7,2012-08-30T15:42Z,"Hey Raptor05121, yes the exe. file upload would be great to upload. In my past experience, the only way the new carenado planes would work, is if you upload and install it through the exe. file. That'll be much appreciated."
,aarque,2012-08-30T16:02Z,"The best way to capture a rip is to make a fake FSX folder, copy the FSX app into the folder, then point the installer at that folder. That will capture SimObjects (planes) gauges, modules, proprietary .dll's in the publishers folder (C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft GamesMicrosoft Flight Simulator XCarenado, for example) and anything that is installed within the FSX folder. It will not capture .dll's or .lic files hidden within the Windows, ProgramData or Appdata folders; these are some of the places publishers like Flight1 place their security files."
,RodrigoAviation,2012-08-30T19:20Z,"Some parts of the aircraft are invisible. It's because some dlls are missing, in places like app data, and system folders... You just can fix it if you send us the installer of the aircraft, not just the folders! Thanks a lot!"
,jrma3,2012-08-30T22:10Z,just with the exe. without the email/serial i think it dont means nothing
,Taco92,2012-08-31T01:06Z,"Thank you Raptor. Even though it doesn't work, at least you made the effort of buying something and sharing it here. But there are some ungrateful bastards out there."
,Katin85,2012-08-31T01:15Z,Don't lost your time downloading it!!! It have bugs... :(
,Crash2701,2012-09-01T06:56Z,what bugs?
,FSKing2,2012-09-01T13:04Z,Does not work!
,Raptor05121,2012-09-01T18:35Z,"AS SAID ABOVE, THIS DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
,737pilot7,2012-09-02T05:42Z,"Hey  Raptor can you just install the 182T into a ""Dummy"" or ""Fake"" folder and reupload it?"
,peacerock,2012-09-02T11:29Z,"Thanks for the torrent.
Req: FLIGHT 1 - SUPER 80 ULTIMATE AIRLINER EDITION. please"
,CommanderShepard,2012-09-02T18:31Z,Fucking retard... UPLOAD SOMETHING THAT WORKS FFS!A
,LordDoom337,2012-09-02T20:44Z,I really wish uploaders like Raptor05121 would stop wasting everybody's time and bandwidth by uploading useless torrents like this one that don't work...

,DM1Flyer,2012-09-05T16:15Z,"Please post original installer EXE and I will make a repack with no serial/email required.  I don't need your registration info to unpack orig exe.

Thanks!!"
,LordDoom337,2012-09-05T19:52Z,"@DM1Flyer:
Is that even possible?
How is it done?"
,DM1Flyer,2012-09-05T23:14Z,"@LordDoom337 - It is possible, and it works.  I've made repacks for all the Carenado FSX planes.

You just need the right tools for the job.  :D"
,LordDoom337,2012-09-08T00:35Z,"@DM1Flyer:
Can you tell me which tools you use?
I wanna learn how to do it.
I might be able to share some planes in the process."
