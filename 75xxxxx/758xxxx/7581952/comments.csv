,Souldiver333,2012-08-30T15:17Z,I started to download and discovered it is 2 files. Do people still need movies on 2 cd's?

,coolhanddool,2012-08-30T15:32Z,"hey, souldiver333, when its on 2 cd's , its better quality , cause when you burn it to a dvd, its does not get quality reduction to fit on just one cd.
So i prefer 2 cd's to keep the original quality."

,LegoLazze,2012-08-31T13:55Z,"Souldiver


I own a DVD that wont play files larger than 1Gb

so yes, when the size of the rip is as big as this, there are ppl who wants the movies in two filles.
'cause it actually take some time to split the files yourself, but I bet you knew that if you up to date with the tech"

,TH3_R3AL_KR33PA,2012-09-01T03:39Z,Great upload as well as movie. JCVD still has it.
,oigveh,2012-09-01T05:25Z,"i believe Souldiver333 was referring to the fact that a dvd holds more, what kind of deuchebag wants to even use cd's.  most players can use a usb flash drive as well.  even better quality to fit on one dvd since they hold 4.7GB rather than 700MB.  ive wondered the same thing for awhile now.  hey legolazze spring for the $50 it cost for a dvd or blueray player, if it plays the movie and stops before the end on a file over 1gb its most likely because someone patched 2 files together and didn't re-index it.  takes like under 5 minutes to re-index then all plays fine. and coplaining about the time it takes to split the files? what the 5 minutes, which by the way you would be watching it already on a usb drive"
,Sknmissle,2012-09-01T13:40Z,who the hell burns cd's anymore drag and drop to memory card take memory card and plug into tv use tv's built in media player total time to download and then start watching is about 10 min. At least get with the times you are living in.

,skulldragon,2012-09-02T05:05Z,"Q: 9/10, audio doesn't have skyrocketing peaks, FINALLY.

This movie has shitloads of movie and logic mistakes, but it's still enough well made.
Finally, after 100+ TPB TOP downloads, something that doesn't disappoint.

@abszme
Microsoft Windows is good only for building viruses. You need shitloads of 3rd party tools to make that OS work as you want.
For e.g. CCCP and VLC Media Player are top 2 tools for watching videos on Microsoft Windows."

,trace535,2012-09-04T22:46Z,"With a budget of 10 million $, you'd think they could have used an actual 35mm film camera, and not a cheap Red One MX digital. It looks like an amateur film. I bet all the budget went to pay Van Damme's salary. Even movies shot in the cheaper 16mm format (Black Swan, Hurt Locker, Leaving Las Vegas) look better than digital."

Wow this might be my favorite Jean Claude movie! Dude never looks old and kicks ass in this.. Its kinda like the movie 'Taken' but more realistic.. Has  alot of great lines in it, esp. at the end of the movie. I will add this to my collection to keep."

Jean-Claude Van Damme should have retired years ago, and in fact I think he did but maybe he needs a new extension on his house or something.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and it gave me a virus.
