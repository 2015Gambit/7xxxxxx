now i get the 99.0% and all files success
but still wen i get to (3000) it says.

(connot connecto to servers 

pleasebe sure to have internet connectivity and to check your wifi. it is also possible that our servers are under heavy load at this time so try again later.)

i see from forums that my phone needs ""adreno data files."" i dunno what that is but just saying if it helps.

i know it's getting annoying lots of questions and problems.. sorry about that."

Yes their server get to high load all the time.You can try the night that arent many players there.Also i can find and upload the adreno data but they are way to much for my upload speed.If you can wait i will upload them one of the next days."

First can you tell me which phone you have?Because i must be sure if it needs adreno/tegra/mali/qualcom."

Oh again nice.Yes the server is a pain in the ass to download the full data correctly but when you do that the game will play fine all the time.Its the best rpg out there."
