Information
------------------------------

Jimmy's Forest 
High up in a spectacular tree house, Jimmy Doherty develops an intimate understanding of the inner workings of a British forest. Country boy and farmer Jimmy Doherty is as happy as a pig in... Well, in a very nice pigsty. Holed up in a spectacular tree house, he's charting the seasonal changes of a Norfolk wood. Which means dissecting woodpeckers, eating roadkill, drinking sap from a tree and tracking deer. There are some brilliant nuggets of information and Jimmy's enthusiasm for the great outdoors is very infectious.



4)  Winter 
It's winter in the forest and after a heavy snowfall the wood is looking magical. With fresh snow on the ground Jimmy can trace the footprints of the animals and birds in the wood. He discovers how insects survive the winter, exposes tree roots to see how far they spread, watches 80,000 rooks fly in to their roost, makes a Yukon fire pit bed and discovers there is an unwelcome predator in the forest...
