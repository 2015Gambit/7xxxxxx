Jonathan Safran Foer, acclaimed young author of Everything is Illuminated, fell in love with the work of Joseph Cornell while still a student at Princeton University and embarked on an ambitious project: to interest some of America's best-known writers to create original fiction and poetry inspired by the boxed collages of this beloved artist. Beautifully designed and produced--with over 20 tipped-on color plates, some of which are reproduced here for the first time--this original literary anthology will please readers and art lovers alike.
