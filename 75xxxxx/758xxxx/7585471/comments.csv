Yikes! Really? ...uhhh, that's probably not going to happen.

Right now it's 325 folders, 21.8 GB, and that's just WAY too big.

I don't enjoy torrents that large and I don't think most downloaders do, either. It takes too long to download and people are less likely to keep seeding.

Smaller downloads have many benefits, imo.

1. You can choose exactly what you want to download with very little effort (and I don't mind uploading multiple torrents).

2. You get it fast, which makes the process much more enjoyable.

3. You're not overwhelmed by a mass of files at one time, which means you're more likely to actually look at them and/or read them.

4. As I said before, more likely people will keep the seed alive if it's a reasonable size.

Also, some of the books in my collection by the more well-known underground guys are already being seeded.

Lastly, I'm never going to 'Restore' all of them, and that's kind of the point to the ones I'm seeding. "
