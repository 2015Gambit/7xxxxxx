I've trying to download this for hours unsuccessfully. It starts fast with many seeders but then stops every minute with error, that it cannot read the data it's downloading, I have no problem with other downloads, just this one... PLEASE, do something, now I'm stuck at 35% and advance only from 0.2% to 0.2%, I want the books but it's taking ages....
