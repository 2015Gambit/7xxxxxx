Changelog:

* Added 300 Grammar Exercises
* Made it possible to practice past particle and gerund tenses.
* Made it possible to practice ""previous errors""(this only works for errors made in reports that are saved with this version in; it won't work for errors made for reports saved in previous versions of the app)
* Added 200+ image vocabulary exercises.
* Fixed a problem which caused displays to flicker on certain devices.
* Made it possible to move the app to SD."
