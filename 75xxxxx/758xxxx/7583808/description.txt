When Chhaya's eyes catch sight of an unfinished sculpture, her mind catches an infection. Gradually sucking at the fabric of her life, it turns her harmless need for the sculpture into an uncontrollable craving. Like any infection, it affects whatever it touches - her home, her dreams, her childless condition and Arvind, the only family she's got. Chhaya has to have that sculpture, no matter what the price.
