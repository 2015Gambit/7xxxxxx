BTW, hope no other smart-ass 'wanting stuff to be labeled correctly' register just to say this is actually only 816p, claiming 'all the ""p"" just means resolution' LMFAO"
,plokijuhy,2012-08-31T07:14Z,"720/1080 are the uncropped resolution, so a cropped 2.35:1 frame becomes 816 and it's labeled correctly as 1080"
,pjones452,2012-08-31T07:30Z,thanks!
,newline1,2012-08-31T10:57Z,"we need to know any confermation about resolution people, any body had download it yet?

,dWdHELLCAT,2012-09-01T13:00Z,1920 x 1080 @ 29.97 fps would be best.

That doesn't make any sense. The movie was shot at 24fps (23.976) and in 2.35:1 ratio. So 1920X1080 would just have hard coded black bars and the frame rate conversion would make it look worse and juttery. 

I get how some players need hard coded black bars so that the video is full 1920x1080 and asking for that but the frame rate is just silly. "
