The German Airports Team is again setting new standards in terms of quality, realism, and friendly frame rates. All airports are developed according to the 2012 status. Included are the airports of Cologne/Bonn, Hanover, Dortmund, Munster/Osnabruck and Leipzig/Halle in an absolutely astonishing quality.
 
All buildings, runway layout, taxiways, lighting and NAV aids are true to the original. Built on high resolution aerial images the airports and their surroundings show an absolute realistic image of the real world. Another highlight is the use of the Dynamic Airport Enhancement Services. The services ensure dynamic traffic on the apron and surrounding roads and motorways creating a lively atmosphere.
