MalwarebytesΓÇÖ Anti-Malware is considered to be the next step in the detection and removal of malware. In our product we have compiled a number of new technologies that are designed to quickly detect, destroy, and prevent malware. MalwarebytesΓÇÖ Anti-Malware can detect and remove malware that even the most well known anti-virus and anti-malware applications fail to detect. MalwarebytesΓÇÖ Anti-Malware monitors every process and stops malicious processes before they even start. The Realtime Protection Module uses our advanced heuristic scanning technology which monitors your system to keep it safe and secure. In addition, we have implemented a threats center which will allow you to keep up to date with the latest malware threats.
