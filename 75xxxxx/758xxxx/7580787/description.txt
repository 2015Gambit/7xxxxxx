just solar power with a very simple and inexpensive device that 
you can modify at your discretion to make it bigger and more effective.

Either if you want to cook in places where fires are not allowed 
or you don't want to reveal your presence with smoke or for a 
number of other reasons or just harness solar power to your 
benefit, here is a simple and fantastic solution.


I can't seed for long, so please keep alive by seeding. Thanks.
