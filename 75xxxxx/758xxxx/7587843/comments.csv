,yakirvo,2012-09-01T01:06Z,"NOT WORKING
I DID WHAT YOU SAID
AND WHEN IM GOING TO THE GAME ITS STOP 
FUCK IT"
,Netarangi,2012-09-01T01:17Z,"Works fine.

Except there's no DLC activated in this version so you lose it all."
,OmniNegro,2012-09-01T01:28Z,"Works. Anyone saying it does not and screaming like a retard is just that.

Did you bother to run the batch file and wait? It takes time. It works on the 3DM version of 1.4 that was patched onto the original Skidrow release.

A little bird told me so."
,A9entZer0,2012-09-01T01:48Z,"Tried this with VANSIK repack and the game doesn't work anymore, thanks anyway."
,SgtSlick,2012-09-01T01:48Z,"Backed up my game, crossing fingers - hope this works - here it goes.."

,pukhtoon707,2012-09-01T03:57Z,"Works fine with 3DM 1.4 crack, but still doesnt work when HD texture is enable,just freezes at loading. Any solution for this yet ?????????"
,rcords,2012-09-01T04:06Z,"Worked here, however it's now not allowing the HD textures to be selected in the advanced gfx options even though I have them."
,omnimodis,2012-09-01T04:16Z,"Ok, so does this work without Steam installed?  Does it work if the game was first cracked as per OmniNegro's instructions here: ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7568756/Sleeping.Dogs.NEW.Crackfix-SKIDROW ) ?  I just downloaded this and can't get it to work - nothing at all happens when I try to run the game (and yes, I ran the bat file, and it did complete whatever it was doing)."
,omnimodis,2012-09-01T04:17Z,Sorry....OmniNegro's instructions from here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7568994/Sleeping.Dogs.Crackfix-SKIDROW
,RruleTT,2012-09-01T06:52Z,Doesn't work with steam unlocked version
,OmniNegro,2012-09-01T07:23Z,"It worked for a little bird I met with the instructions I reposted in the link omnimodis. I think the only hope for those who cannot get High Detail Textures to work is to set them with 1.4 BEFORE running this to update to 1.5. That leaves them selected. You should never touch them afterwards.

I honestly do not know what is the problem for so many people. I would not be surprised if they are hired goons trying to use FUD to scare people from trying the game.

No, I am not accusing anyone of that. I just think it looks suspicious that so many people have problems. This was as quick and easy as it could be for that little bird.

I am however accusing anyone screaming about viruses of being a brainless moron driven by fear to use defective antiviral shit that wants to flag everything on Earth as malware. 

Use Clamwin. Manually scan. It shows nothing unsafe. Why? Because Clamwin is free and does not have a pay version that gives a motive to rip-off everyone with fear-mongering."
,OmniNegro,2012-09-01T07:25Z,"BTW, anyone trying to run delta.exe manually is not reading the instructions. 

It will work just fine if you just run the batch file like step three of the instructions."
,olimpas83,2012-09-01T07:58Z,I done step by step that and its not worked. :(
,Jamvad,2012-09-01T08:00Z,Doesn't work with the Vansik repack. Can someone hear me? :D
,Insomneac,2012-09-01T08:41Z,"The reason it's not working for people is that the crack needs certain Steam registry keys.

You have to install Steam, then it should work."
,OmniNegro,2012-09-01T08:43Z,"Yes. We heard you and the others saying it does not work with the Vansik version, nor the unlocked version.

Relax. Someone will probably make a version for you. If not, then your only choices are to grab on of the other versions or buy it. Sorry."
,Machine4578,2012-09-01T11:22Z,The DLC works fine grab the fix from Steam006(v1.4 dlc fix) and then only use the HKShip.exe and the buddha.dll from the new SKIDROW 1.5 crack and DLC is working..make sure you change steamclient.dll path in LumaEmu.ini just as been described in earlier posts

,omnimodis,2012-09-01T18:18Z,"@OmniNegro, I appreciate your help, but not everybody who is having problems is a moron, nor do some of us (i.e. me) come here crying the moment something goes wrong.  I uninstalled and reinstalled this game numerous times trying different approaches, but nothing works.  Your instructions worked for 1.4, got the game working, but after doing what the install notes here state for 1.5, the game is rendered unresponsive. 99% of the times things work out great, but with this game it's a mess...looking at all the comments, I think those claiming that everything is fine are the ones who either haven't even tried playing the game, or they're straight out lying."

,pukhtoon707,2012-09-01T21:52Z,"How to install with 1.5 update.

1 Download skidrow version of (Sleeping Dogs Limited Edition DLC RePack-VANSIK) from Heromaster(6.29GB). By default its 1.3 version,it will work without copying any crack if not thn just copy the crack but remember some people had issues with ver 1.3.

2 Download 3DMGame 1.4 update(1.7GB)

3 Dwonload 3DM 1.4 crack (6.35MB), Download update 1.5(36MB)

4 Install the game with HD textures enabled.

5 Copy and paste all content from 3DMGAME(1.7GB) into main game   directory.

6 Copy and paste every thing from update 1.4 to main game dir, you   may need to replace some files.Run update10to14,dont worry if it   gives you an error.

7 Copy and replace crack files from crack folder into game dir.
  When you run the game you will notice version 1.4 at the bottom of   the screen after the intro.
8 Now copy and replace ver 1.5 into main dir.

Some antivirus software might detect buddha.dll as a virus,just turn off your antivirus while downloading,block it afterwards.To prevent it from antivirus detection make a zip folder of update 1.5.

Unfortunatly HD textures doesnt work with ver 1.4 and ver 1.5, the default version is 1.3 you dont need to actually copy any crack it worked for me,HD textures also works fine with ver 1.3. To change the graphics setting 1st click save(Yes) and than no when it ask you again which will take you back to main menu.

This worked for me,hopefully this will solve your problem.

Thanks"
,ivanhoe68,2012-09-01T21:53Z,"Thx for this, got 70+fps after this update, was about 30fps in the cities before this update, and im on extreme settings!

System specs:
AMD Phenom II Quad 3.5ghz

Windows 7 Professional
"
,OmniNegro,2012-09-01T22:36Z,"This works. Believe that or choose not to. I went a different way from the instructions posted by pukhtoon707. Yet it works fine for my friend the little bird.

If ten million idiots scream it that Windows does not work at all, does that magically make it fail to work for those of us without our heads in our asses? No. It works.

I used the Skidrow release, followed directly by the crack, crackfix, and then overwrote that with the 3DM 1.4 and patched it from there. The game worked fine at the 3DM 1.4 and that is where I set the high definition textures. After patching to 1.5 the setting persisted.

I think too many people have bad files that came from questionable at best sources. Stick to the posters with colored skull and crossbones by the name. That is there for a reason."
,MLO89,2012-09-01T23:15Z,"I'll be god damned if this didn't work. I had the KaO version which was working perfectly. I was a bit hesitant in trying this (because of it's small size when the patch is like 185 mb) but I really wanted the 1.5 patch so I gave it a try. Copied everything over re-writing as necessary and executed the ""Update v1.4-to-1.5.bat"" file and let it do it's thing. Afterwards I had my fingers crossed as I clicked on the game. Son of a bitch, when right in, fucking version 1.5. Got the new controls, game works much better mouse movement wise and I still got my HD textures. Fucking A stoked."
,Luke_Wolf,2012-09-02T01:21Z,"Well, I had the skidrow release, updated to 1.4, worked like a charm without crackfix or anything except for some stuttering. Installed this and now the game won't start. And no I'm not an idiot, I've been cracking games since I was ten years old and I can't get this to work no matter what I do. Updated my video drivers, reinstalled the game, nothing works. "
,KidRapper,2012-09-02T05:14Z,"Thank you, this worked perfectly! I was worried about my save files so I had them backed up, but apparently they are intact. :)

However, I seems to have lost all the DLC's except the Just Cause 2 pack. How do I get them back? Should I copy the cracked DLC content over this again or will that mess up the game?

A word of advice on this would be much appreciated guys. :)

Thanx again."
,venomexp,2012-09-02T06:15Z,"@pukhtoon707 can you send me the link to the 1.4 update?? cuz i have this :

,ivory_soul,2012-09-09T03:14Z,"@pukhtoon707 I appreciate your instructions, and they helped a tiny bit. They are pretty confusing and don't make sense, so I revised them and it worked perfectly.

Sleeping Dogs has WAY too many different updates, cracks, patches, and fixes. This game is an absolute nightmare and I have been cracking games since I was 15. Here's my instructions to get 1.5 and DLC working.

1) Download this torrent game and install it with HD textures.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7551450/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_MULTI_7_CRACKED_NEW_UPDATE_1.4

2)Download this 1.4 update, copy in into the install directory and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547939/3DMGAME-Sleeping.dogs.v1.4.Update-3DM.7z

3)Copy over this 1.4 crack and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547614/Sleeping_Dogs_-_v1.4_-_3DM_Crack_Only

4) Download this 1.5 update (the one you're one now!) and overwrite. Run the 1.4-1.5.bat file and ignore the errors.

5) To get DLC working download this torrent and copy to Sleeping Dogs folder and overwrite when asked.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7597494/Sleeping_Dogs_v1.5_Crack_with_All_DLC(Working)

6)Open LumaEmu.ini and replace the path for steam_api.dll with the current Sleeping Dogs path.

That's it! I did this exactly and the game launched with no issues!
"
,ivory_soul,2012-09-09T04:24Z,Does anyone know how to re-enable HD textures? I think this update removes them. Any idea how to re-install them?
,paulovgha,2012-09-10T06:05Z,"@ivory_soul

I don't know about the HD textures, man, but your instructions and links worked for me as a charm! Thanks!

Great torrent, tikasukaz!"
,ivory_soul,2012-09-16T00:22Z,"I found a way to install HD textures but it is a HUGE pain in the ass. First you have to re-install this download (most of you already have it) with HD textures in a SEPERATE location.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7551450/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_MULTI_7_CRACKED_NEW_UPDATE_1.4

2.Copy over from NEW location the following files into the OLD location. 

Characters.big and .bix
CharactersHD.big and .bix

GameHD and HD2.big and .bix
Game.big and .bix

I know the 1.5 update changes Game.big, but if you want HD textures this is the way to do it. I didn't have any issues so far with slowdown or FPS drops. I did this about 2 weeks ago, so I'm pretty sure those are all the files you need to transfer."
