,setgecko,2012-09-02T23:21Z,"BigBlueSea thank you a great deal! I have downloaded all of them, but 1 question arose: when I upload it on my PocketBook device, it says that files are damaged/protected. It opens other epubs. And yours are not damaged, I can open them on my PC. I guess they are locked? how can I unlock them. thanks"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-09-03T00:13Z,"@setgecko

All my files have have been stripped of DRM,they should open on any device that supports it's format.

The only thing I can think of is that's it's an issue with your device.Maybe you need to configure it or something.I wish I could be of more help.Have you tried doing a search on the matter ???.This is the first time I had someone with this problem "
