Think of it this way, if it were illegal to smuggle bibles and preach the word to a foreign country do you think that would stop us? No we would break the law and smuggle the bibles and preach the word. The concept is the same here. Not everyone might be able to afford this Christian music nor have access to it. Better to have leaked Christian music then have to have to only listen to secular trash.

And I know what you are thinking. Then just do not listen to the secular music. Not that simple. We are human just like you, have additions and are not perfect. Someone downloading this music might be addicted to secular music and looking for an avenue to break their habit. 

Nice try in trying to troll these torrents, a very sad attempt but we saw it coming a mile away. Why don't you go protest all the porn and movies that are illegal uploaded? 

And I know you are going to say well they are not saying that they are Holier than though; and are Christians. Well neither are we. No one here has put us above everyone else. You are assuming we are which makes you what, somewhat knowledgeable about Christianity? We are not perfect and make mistakes like everyone else. So with your knowledge I would assume you are the stronger Christian and need to go witness to people on the side of the road because I think you will have better luck there than on a torrent site.

Put that in your pipe and smoke it,
Ted Dekker"
