2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

For those following along, it's my hope to share 1000 releases by the end of 2012.  And today's 34th bundle contains 28 more releases, bringing my year to date total up to 892.  That's just 108 shy of my goal.  With an average of approximately 25 albums per bundle, four more bundles and I'll be done for the year.
