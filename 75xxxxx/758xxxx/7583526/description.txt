If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.


For anyone that having problems with apply the theme or getting errors apply the default theme first then reboot and apply the flow theme

This theme is for XHDPI ONLY!
HDPI will come really soon with an update!
This is not finished yet but updates will come through playstore!
"Also the dock icons and some other graphics will come with later updates too."
What's in this version : (Updated : Aug 29, 2012)

    Fixed some images in settings menu
    Added a nice new preview image in theme chooser
    Fixed some statusbar glitches (still the statusbar will get a nice update!)
    More to come!
