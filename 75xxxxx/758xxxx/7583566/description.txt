If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.


This theme contains 220+ icons & counting! & it also contains the 3 wallpapers seen in the screenshots.
Note: The icons are set to large in the screenshots. You can easily do this by: menu > preferences > visual settings > icons > icon size > large size.

I take icon requests so please feel free to email me or leave a comment suggesting which app icons you'd like to see themed & I'll make it =)

This is NOT a standalone app, so download Go Launcher EX in the market if you haven't already done so.
