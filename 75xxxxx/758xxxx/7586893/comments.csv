I think i find your problem with this game.You must put the sd files in sdcard/Android/Obb and not insdcard/Android/data.Asphalt 7,amazing spiderman,DKRISES has obb files.

Do that and let me know if it run fine.

After you copy the folder of sd files open wifi.Then open the game.It will give you Force Close on time.Then it will run fine all the time"
