Contains all 3 official patches and the unofficial patch from The Sorcerer's Place giving an upper level limit of Level 20 and corresponding higher spells. Also has a no-cd ToEE.exe that works with Windows 7.

This is my second attempt to upload these files with a name that can be easily searched and found.

I've tried other no-cd patches from TPB and other torrent sites, but this is the only one that has kept working on my system.

Tried the patches on all Windows OS except Vista and they work fine except for Windows 7. Haven't tried any of the Co8 mods, yet.
