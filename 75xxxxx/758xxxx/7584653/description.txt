Hey! guys i got this program AWHILE back. i got this handy tool on garys hood ( dont know the url but you can google it. I still use it for all my runescape needs, such as hot/cold x2 auto typing. it works fine and includes:

a Calculator - kinda useless, but it includes one!

an Autotyper - works pretty well, unlimited typing amount, and can set a timer when to type. also has hotkeys to start and stop.

an Autoclicker - simple but effective, has hotkeys to start and stop clicking and can even go into the miliseconds. Great for alching. (what i do is load more than one up and use different times for each one, so the clicking is staggered while i alch). 

well. enjoy the program, feel free to scan this program or open it in a virtual drive like sandboxie.

please check out my other uploads and seed so others can have these great programs too.

i will always be seeding when i have utorrent open.

thanks.
