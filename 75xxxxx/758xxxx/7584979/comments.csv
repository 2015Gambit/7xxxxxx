,rodrigovcs,2012-08-31T10:38Z,"man, I can't stress how much I am thankful for this! please add me on msn rodrigovanderlei@hotmail.com, I will send you 10 bucks on paypal just as a thank you, and (if possible) you can seed me directly. but even if not, THANK YOU A LOT!!! this thing is the shit to me, abraรงos from brazil!"
,terpsfan101,2012-08-31T11:42Z,"rodrigovcs,

Thanks for you're appreciation, but I could never accept a monetary donation. Instead, why don't you directly support the show. Go to itunes and buy the 4 most recent episodes. It will only cost you $8. You can delete them once you're done downloading them, since they'll have DRM."
,terpsfan101,2012-08-31T11:59Z,"Or better yet, buy some Soup merchandise:

google: cafepress thesoup

Get a t-shirt, then you can be a walking advertisement for the show."
,agekindly,2012-08-31T15:29Z,"At least Im not the only one collecting this goldmine of a show! Ive been doing the same as you since 2009 but unluckily I did not have the fortune of a large drive until late last year,the oldest I have salvaged are from early 2010, but this addition will keep me busy thank you so much man I will try to seed as much as possible!"
,Jack0ff,2012-08-31T21:05Z,"yes, thank you very much for this post. i am currently helping seed. using my own files i brought your torrent up to 64% on my comp without d/l anything :)
FYI: i have 2008 complete and some 2007. after i get this 100% i will go though mine and make an 'addon' torrent to your nice upload :)"
,terpsfan101,2012-08-31T23:51Z,"Jack0ff,

Thanks for helping with the seeding. Looking forward to those 2007-08 episodes. I have a few questions for you:

I am missing the 2008-12-22 episode titled The.Soup.Presents.2008.The.Year.In.Soup.DSRip.XviD-aAF. Do you have this episode?

My episode for 2008-09-12 failed the CRC test when I extracted it from the rar archive. The episode plays back fine. I was wondering if your file matches what I have. My CRC for this episode is EE32CF0A."
,Jack0ff,2012-09-01T19:33Z,"1. Wow, and i thought i had 2008 complete...no it appears i do not have The.Soup.Presents.2008.The.Year.In.Soup.DSRip.XviD-aAF
2. my 2008-09-12 version is by AoG and is 125Mb...why are your AoG rips converted to 175Mb? AoG rips where all over the place from 80Mb to 600+ Mb. thats what i have.

,terpsfan101,2012-09-01T22:56Z,"Thanks for checking your collection JackOff. Not much I can do about the slow downloading speeds. If I disconnected, all the torrent pieces needed for completion would be in the swarm. So it's up to the leechers that have faster connections than me to get this thing moving faster.

""why are your AoG rips converted to 175 Mb?""

They were released by aAF, not AoG. I noticed that there were smaller rips for 2008 when I was downloading them from UseNet last year.

It would probably be a good idea to include your version of the 2008-09-12 episode when you upload your torrent."

wow, thats great news the aAF(scene) rips were always better...i cant believe i was collecting AoG when aAF was clearly available :)

no problem"
,Jack0ff,2012-09-08T22:07Z,"yay, i got around to posting me soup 'Addon' torrent to your collection. i renamed all the files to match this torrent so the files are consistent...enjoy :)
