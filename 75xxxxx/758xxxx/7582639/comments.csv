,serena101,2012-09-03T03:54Z,or atleast an mpeg2 version 
,serena101,2012-09-11T20:25Z,"hi,

Im serena. Iv'e just finished downloading the movie that you uploaded. I would like to thank you for uploading the movie. I appreciate your effort in uploading the movie. I really do. it was very hard to find that film. I wanted to convert and burn it on dvd so that I can watch it on tv. Unfortunately the resolution is too small for the standards. So is it okay if you upload the whole dvd item? If it is too difficult for you, maybe you can upload the same movie in a higher resolution? The resolution must be atleast 720x480 and the framesperseconds must be 29.970.  I hope that I'm not asking too much from you. Hope to hear from you soon :))"
