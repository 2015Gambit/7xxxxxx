,napsterdp,2012-08-30T21:16Z,Screenshots look very bad for a 5.5Gb file. If this was 1.5Gb then I would agree with the quality of screenshots. I will skip this and wait for a better version.

,Revisionist,2012-08-30T23:42Z,you honestly cant tell anything about a video by random screenshots.... and a screen cant tell you if there are sych issues or sound problems.  I feel like most people post them make the vid seem REAL and BOZX doesnt have to worry about that. 
,deaderweterdog,2012-08-31T02:30Z,the skull doesnt show quality iv seen a lot of shitty quality from skulls but skulls are usuly honest about the quality such as a cam will always look shitty but usuly skuls will say cam on lable where anons offten dont
,Faced1111,2012-08-31T02:47Z,"Had to register for this...

This video is not 720p it might of been rendered down from a 720p version but that hardly makes anything 720p...hoped EVERYONE would know this by now but all the ""p"" just means resolution.

Therefore if you need the ""p"" to understand, its actually only 544p

Not hating i just want stuff to be labeled correctly, if you want to only upload 720p size movies then don't re-size the movie keep it at 720p and kill the detail per pixel not the size...in my opinion the most important part is the size because if your enlarging to a 1920x1080 screen its not going to look nearly as good if you were to enlarge from a 1280x720 instead.

Just my opinion, its just misleading "
,firexninja,2012-08-31T02:58Z,thank you!
,Weemz,2012-08-31T03:41Z,"Faced111 - This movie, like so many others, is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It's very rare to find a theatrical release with a resolution of either 1280x720 or 1920x1080 because most movies have an aspect ratio of either 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 (aka 2.39:1 or 2.40:1).  If you divide 1280 by 720, you get 1.78, which is 16x9.  If you divide 1280x544, you get approximately 2.35.  The 1080p version of this, and other 2.35:1 moies, will have a resolution of a1920x816 (or 1920x800).

I hoped EVERYONE would know this by now but the unknowledable continue to pour in.  Now that you know this much, please continue to research audio and video.  There's much to learn and it can be quite interesting."
,THANGDL,2012-08-31T03:51Z,All of yours are very good. Thank so much!!!
,Faced1111,2012-08-31T05:18Z,"well then how does the movie industry get away with this all the time because its completely false advertising, 720p is a specific number...it doesnt mean 544
its like ordering a steak that has the corner cut out when you get it its some bs, have the movie/media industry been doing that for a while releasing 1280x544 movies and present them to the consumer at 720p?"

,Mariox7,2012-08-31T10:10Z,Seed people. This will take 5 days f*ck. There is currently 5 people seeding.
,BrentacoN,2012-08-31T11:36Z,"@Faced1111 ""p"" has nothing to do with resolution, ""p"" means progressive scan rather than the older ""i"" representing interlace.

resolution is represented by the pixels per square inch i.e 1980 pixels by 1080 pixes with progressive scan will be 1080p.

if you play a blue ray disk, then look at the info pane on your media player it will say a sligtly different resolution a lot of the time.

There are 2 HD classes 720p and 1080p so it gets rounded off."

,you_are_deluded,2012-09-03T00:07Z,@BrentacoN - the resolution of the the vertical axis determines the 720/1080 etc. It has nothing to do with the horizontal as that can vary depending on the produced aspect ratio.
,AxBattler,2012-09-03T18:07Z,"@ you_are_deluded
The other way around."
,SheldorTheConqueror,2012-09-04T04:36Z,"@AxBattler
Correct you are sir.
Horizontal of 1920 = 1080 res
Horizontal of  1280 = 720 res

On a 16x9 it works out to the 1920x1080 and 1280x720 we all know and love as 720p/1080p.

.

.

Still, I agree it is false advertising.  The vertical aspect should be fixed so you can crop to 16x9 without losing res."
