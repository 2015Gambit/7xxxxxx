,Lexie._.,2012-08-31T06:14Z,"I don't usually play 2d games, i'll give it a shot because its a horror game. :P

Thanks for the upload!"
,kewlin,2012-08-31T07:46Z,Seed to 2.0 ratio. I will buy the game if it fun enough.
,openarena,2012-08-31T10:39Z,Can you always upload actual version when it comes out?
,debugman18,2012-09-01T03:05Z,"@openarena, this is the actual download, and it is also the most recent release."
,openarena,2012-09-05T07:54Z,"no, version 0.50b ist the newest:)"
,debugman18,2012-09-07T04:06Z,"@openarena Maybe you are confused. It says here http://www.benjaminrivers.com/games/home/contact-support.html
very clearly that the most recent version is 1.3.1, which is the version uploaded here. It was updated on August 17th."
,LestradeTGQ,2012-09-13T18:16Z,"Hey folks!

This is Benjamin Rivers, the developer of Home. Just wanted to pop in and say ""hi""âI noticed you all in my traffic reports. :-)

Torrenting Home is not illegal (thanks to the Creative Commons license it's under), but as Markofbear said, if you dig it, I do hope you support it on Steam!

Either way, thanks for playing,
B."
,debugman18,2012-09-13T18:47Z,"@Lestrade, if you are the developer, just wanted to say good job with the game. For a 2D story-driven horror game, it does a lot with what it can. I did buy it, of course. ;) "
,LestradeTGQ,2012-09-15T13:04Z,"Thanks, debugman18! I am indeed the developer."
