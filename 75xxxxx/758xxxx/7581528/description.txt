"Awakened by an oncoming storm, you open your eyes to discover yourself in a strange, dark roomΓÇötucked away in a house thatΓÇÖs not yours.

As you play the game, it changesΓÇösubtly, almost imperceptiblyΓÇöto reflect your perspective. It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its truths are entirely subjective.

Home is a unique horror adventure set in a beautifully-realized pixel world. ItΓÇÖs a murder mystery with a twistΓÇöbecause you decide what ultimately happens." 

To play the game, just run the exe, no installation required.

Enjoy! If you like it, buy it! Support the developers, they are indie after all!
