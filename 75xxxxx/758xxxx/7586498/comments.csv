Why in the pdf file it's not possible to watch the video after download it? 

Thanks"

Many thanks!"
,Romgun,2012-09-01T09:48Z,"Some guys report about errors after update (duplicated titles of aircrafts).
I think that the problem occurs because FSX was installed in the ""Program Files (x86)"". 

Try this:
(simbol ""*"" is a back slash)

1) delete folder Microsoft Flight Simulator X*SimObjects*UT2 Aircraft
2) reinstall ATP F1UT-2.exe
2) move the folder “UT2 Aircraft” to disk D (for example)
3) open FSX.CFG and  in the section [Main] replace:

SimObjectPaths.*** = SimObjects*UT2 Aircraft 
to
SimObjectPaths.*** = D:*UT2 Aircraft (for example)

4) install “ATP UPDATE-08-2012.exe”
5) install “Voicepack Update-08-2012.exe” (optional)
6) install “Update-31_08_2012.exe”
7) move  folder “UT2 Aircraft”  back to  and restore FSX.CFG."

,yuca,2012-09-05T15:53Z,"How come my ATC goes back to normal speaking speed after this update? I had accelerated the speed in which ATC communicates and after this update it is gone. Running EditVoicePack gives and error locating USEnglishBig.evpORG. I locate this file on the ATC_before_082012 folder and move it to the new created ATC folder and run EVP an nothing happens. It does not even give the option to accelerate the ATC. Any help?

Thanks for all the hard work. :)"
