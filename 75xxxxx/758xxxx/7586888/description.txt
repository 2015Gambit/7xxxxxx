ITS FREEWARE SO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT FROM THE URL ABOVE.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer. Basically speaking, run sandboxie before you download a skechy program, or email, or open a webpage, its basically a test space, before you let it onto your computer.

-------------------------Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox--------------------------

   | Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. 

   | Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. 

   | Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. 

   | Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.
