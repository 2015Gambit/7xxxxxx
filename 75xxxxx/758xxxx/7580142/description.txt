When Franco died, we were 30
Directed by Gustavo Cortes Bueno
Release Date: 2005

On November the 20th 1975, Franco dies. It was thirty years ago. The Spanish director Gustavo Cortès Bueno was 30 years old. Franco’s dictatorship over Spain had lasted 40 years. The anniversary of General Franco’s death is the occasion to tackle the difficult task of looking back over the willingly forgotten History of Franco’s years: the story of a collective amnesia.

What is left of the dictatorship ’s in modern Spain ? For many it is still too early to talk about it: a sign that Franco’s ghost is still hovering above contemporary Spain. Isn’t it high time to listen to those who lived through this period of Spanish history if we don’t want it to sink into oblivion?

The director, getting his own past back, is questioning the collective memory.
