So I'm stuck with no audio. You don't put that in your notes do you? If you wanted to sell it you are putting your software in the wrong place, this is for Sharing, not selling."

But he tryin to run on x64 with IDT soundcard not gonna happen on ubuntu 9.01, This is made for x86 older computer boxes, like a mini-ITX intel 0atom box with 1gb ram to run fast without the high price of a super computer to run your tv. So if you have a old dell pc, etc run the vga cable to your tv and your good to go. "

Since there's no installer with it, I have to use virtualbox to create one.
I like what you've done to though. The panel and the icons and all that looks neat.
Too bad you had to be a selfish money whore.
I mean, it's not like I can't just save all these settings and the things you've done here and use it in my own distro.
This is open source technology dude. People who take money for this will be hated to the oblivion, Just saying."
,Jamblaster,2012-09-01T21:55Z,"Sorry about the negative post. You did give the PW after asking, but I posted this after spending like 2-3 hours trying to get it to work with no luck. The system was incompatible like you say and it was my fault I didn't know. Again sorry and it is a great download. Thank you for the hard work."
,crypto007,2012-09-02T03:39Z,"Thx all, but the only money whore is the cable company, clicking my one link in the entire os to get the live tv channels abc, foorball games,syfy, etc for 0.001 per click is hardly a whore for money but may pay the bill for the server I eat the cost on that has to find the channels for you guys. So complain if you like but you are saving a ton in the long run. "
,macshreds,2012-09-06T00:06Z,Could you please tell us the root password? It's just useless without them..
,macshreds,2012-09-06T00:17Z,^ without it*
