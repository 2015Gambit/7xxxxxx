There are only two characters, male and female, thus the movie presents a pure psychodrama. It was originally a play, but the German moviemakers cinematize it with a fluid camera and strange angles.

The story deals with an encounter between a strange cop and a flaky woman - he suspects her of murdering her children, she is distraught over their deaths. This is really a mood-pece, don't expect the official story to make too much sense. This is about two anguished people trying to relate to each other. The movie is quite daring to make a full feature with only two actors.

Writer Beth B is someone I don't know much about, but apparently she was acive in the underground art scene - maybe pirates know more about her.

This s my first offering in mkv format - let me know if it works.
