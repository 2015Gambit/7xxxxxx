,hal4000,2012-08-30T14:35Z,I've seen lots of people trying to explain things but it seems you don't understand or don't want to. This has been going on for like a month now. It's ridiculous.
,cybergodsig,2012-09-01T03:46Z,Go buy the cd then Hal

,hal4000,2012-09-03T14:31Z,Already got it cybergodsig. Now don't start giving me ignorant remarks matey. I just don't get it. People are even now trying to help you but all you do is give them shit. You're even starting to trash orther people's uploads. How dare you man.
