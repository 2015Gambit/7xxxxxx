J. River Media Center v17.0.182-MPT

I found this and thought it would be nice to share it with TPB community. 
It's not mine and I won't provide any support. I installed the application on my PC (Windows 7 64bit) two days ago and have no issues. 
The file seems to be clean, Norton 2012 didn't detect any viruses or malware but I suggest you check it before installation.

The developers put a lot of time and resources to deliver a top quality software. If you like it then support them by buying a license. I did :D

Enjoy!
