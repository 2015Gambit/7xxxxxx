A man of the cloth finds his congregation divided when his high school sweetheart joins the church, the rumor mill begins to churn, and his outspoken wife grows intensely jealous. Pastor Jones is no stranger to drama. With a congregation comprised largely of outspoken black women, he never has to guess when his flock is upset. But even Pastor Jones is thrown for a loop when his high school girlfriend (Vivica A. Fox) turns up in the pews, and makes her presence known. Meanwhile, as the pastor's mother-in-law (Sheryl Lee Ralph) begins spreading vicious rumors, the future of his marriage rests in his ability to convince his wife that he would never stray.
