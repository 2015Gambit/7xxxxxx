The file was not made by me.
Thanks to Mr. Scully, here is his file info:

This is my own video recording of the Foo Fighters gig in Prague. I shot the video with Panasonic HDC-SD90 and audio with Edirol R-09HR + CA-14 cardioid mics. Only the first minute of video is missing due to me having troubles with the camcorder settings. At first I set it in the "photo" mode and then a beam of light shot from the camcorder and I quickly had to find and disable that option in the menu before the security guys notice me :-)

Right after the intro everybody stood up so I had to stand during the whole concert and handhold the camcorder - so apologies for the occasional shaking but luckily the Panasonic stabilizers are the best! Btw. yes, my arm still hurts. Also there were security guys nearby and I had to walk through metal detectors but I'm not a newbie so I succeeded ;-)

Feel free to spread this video anywhere you want as long as you keep it in original quality without any further edits.
