Dell OEM Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2 English

No key or license is included.  You need to provide your own, legal license.  This is for people who have lost or damaged media.

There were 6 CD's in the distribution.  CD's 1-4 were used for installation of the server.  CD 6 was used to upgrade it to R2.  It is my understanding that the R2 upgrade is now handled by a downloadable update.  CD 5 is Outlook to be used on the desktops.  It is not needed for the server installation.  SBS 2003 included an Outlook license for each desktop.

The original CD volume names are as follows:
CRMLOEM_EN1  (Disc 1)
ARMLOEM_EN2  (Disc 2)
ARMLOEM_EN3  (Disc 3)
ARMLFPP_EN4  (Disc 4)
OFFICE11     (Outlook 2003)
CRMLOEM_EN6  (R2 Technologies CD)

In the MD5 Checksum Files folder, you will find MD5 checksum files made for the contents of each of the original CD's.  You will also find a MD5 checksum file with the hashes of each file in this torrent.
