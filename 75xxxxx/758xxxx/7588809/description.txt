NOTES:

This is my very first release!!!  

My motivation to make the release was due to all the encoded rips in 16:9 aspect ratio
vs. no encoded rips in 4:3 aspect ratio. The 16:9 editions are flawed because it crops 
the original content of the film. This film was never designed for wide-screen TV but, 
MGM is all about making $$$.

The rip has been encoded to be PS3, Apple TV, and iPad friendly.
