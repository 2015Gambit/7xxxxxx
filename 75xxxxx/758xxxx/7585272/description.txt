Tiny Troopers puts you in command of a team of small soldiers. Guide them
through 30 deadly missions with varied objectives: destroy enemy armoured
formations, save hostages and eliminate enemy generals, to name but just a few

Your troopers will face enemy infantry, snipers, technicals and even tanks. The
casualty rate is going to be high but there s an endless supply of fresh
recruits to step up and fill the ranks. Those lucky troopers who survive from
mission to mission will be promoted, and each new stripe they gain makes them
tougher

To increase your troopers chances of survival, use Command Points to give them
better equipment, reinforce their team with a specialist like machine gunner
medic or delta force and call in support drops during missions. War might be
hell but this is the funniest way to fight in one!
