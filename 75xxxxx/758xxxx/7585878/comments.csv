[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-31T21:06Z,"You're most welcome unnim2. No, I have issues 1-6 of Stitched. That may be all there is right now. Can't be much past that, anyway."
,unnim2,2012-09-01T07:05Z,thanks for the response. since #6 is june 12 I thought maybe july and aug is floating around somewhere by now. am a bit lost without demonoid. :-(
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-01T07:41Z,"You're right, does seem like another issue should have hit by now. The Avatar website has no info past issue six, though, so I don't think we're missing anything."
