,ironymon,2012-08-31T09:21Z,"thx, don't know how i skipped 12th one, maybe it wasn't even aired, well, 2 episodes in a row, can it get better? OMG I STILL HAVE half breaking bad season left... nah just kiddin :("
,-G-rad,2012-09-02T00:07Z,"they are running out of ideas,

delicious little highly compressed video file ;-)
[I'm saving ton of disk space and time with x264 MKVs]"
,grekpektis,2012-09-02T21:21Z,"Somethings wrong with the volume, in almost every scene the sound turns off.  Another thing thats wrong is that it can only be played with VLC.  I downloaded the same episode from another uploader and the sound was fine so it's not my computer of video player.  "

,ViolentC,2012-09-06T11:47Z,"So it looks like they are doing a split season again... Wikipidea says there are going to be 25 episodes in season 7 but if you go to the Comedy Central site they are calling this episode the Season Finaly. I guess they will continue to make the DVD and TV seasons differnt and make episode numbering confusing for everyone...
DVD season 7 / TV season 9/10. No Idea when the next episode will air. it's not on the schedual for the next 3 weeks of shows they have posted."
,ViolentC,2012-09-06T11:58Z,"@DarkWeetus : To avoid fakes, ALWAYS check that the torrent was added by eztv. CHECK THE UPLOADER NAME NOT JUST [EZTV] In The Title! There has been a lot of fake's recently, but TBP normaly remove them in 30mins or less...
@grekpektis : I have downloaded hundreds of EZTV torrents. every one of them so good I don't bother rating any more. so either A) you need to update player software on your end. or B) U R A Troll :P"
,ayohalir,2012-09-06T20:21Z,Can someone post pass? on that bowad site there are no surveys for my country.

,ZuperTwal,2012-09-10T15:31Z,how do I unlock the mp4 file? i don't have a password and it keeps directing me to a dodgy malware site
