Play, manage and sync music from your Mac or PC to your Android device. Winamp Pro offers a complete music management solution (2.1 OS & above) featuring wireless desktop sync (Winamp Media Player required), iTunes import, & access to thousands of internet radio stations with SHOUTcast.

Now there are two ways to purchase the Winamp Pro features. Either as an in-app purchase of the "Pro Bundle" from the free version of Winamp for Android or by purchasing this "Winamp Pro" application. If you have already purchased the "Pro Bundle", do not purchase this app.

Pro Features: 

    10-band graphic equalizer 
    Customizable home screen 
    Browse by Folder 
    Crossfade 
    Gapless playback 
    Support for FLAC playback in Folders View (lossless audio playback) 
    Replay Gain 
    Personalized station recommendations 
    Play any streaming audio URL (supported formats only) 
    No ads 

Note:This "Winamp Pro" app is a key (or license) that unlocks the Pro features in the free version of Winamp for Android. If you purchase this app separately in the Android Market (as opposed to an in-app "Pro Bundle" purchase) you will need to keep both apps ("Winamp" and "Winamp Pro") installed.

What's in this version: (Updated : Aug 29, 2012)

    Fixed: Lockscreen crash
    Improved: Shuffle
    Fixed: Album Art issue in Folder view
    Fixed: Title bar not updating in Folder view

Required Android O/S : 2.1+
