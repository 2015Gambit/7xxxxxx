For some time, IΓÇÖve been compelled to arrange speaking  engagements long in advance. Sometimes a title is requested for  a talk scheduled several years ahead. There is, IΓÇÖve found, one  title that always works: ΓÇ£The current crisis in the Middle East.ΓÇ¥  One canΓÇÖt predict exactly what the crisis will be far down the road, but  that there will be one is a fairly safe prediction. That will continue to be the case as long as basic problems of the region are not addressed.
