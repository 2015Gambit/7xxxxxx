Good Cop is a British police procedural television series currently airing on BBC One and BBC One HD, set in the city of Liverpool. The first episode of the four-part series was broadcast on Thursday 30 August 2012.

Minor spoilers in the BBC synopsis of the 1st ep:

It starts as an ordinary day, but while out running on Crosby beach, beat cop PC John Paul Rocksavage (Sav) bumps into his ex-girlfriend Cassandra and their daughter Libby. Sav catches a glimpse of the family he could have had, but Cassie isnât interested in a reunion.

Later that day Sav is having lunch with his best friend and colleague Andy Stockwell when he witnesses a gang of men mistreating a waitress. Sav intervenes and finds himself face to face with a very unpleasant Finch, who threatens to attack the next copper he sees.

Their shift starts and Sav and Andy attend what seems like another regular call out: neighbours have complained about the noise at a house party. But when they arrive at the house, Finch and the gang from the diner are waiting. As Sav tries to get in from the back, Andy manages to get in through the front where the gang launch a brutal assault on him. They escape, leaving Sav tending to a badly beaten Andy.

That night, haunted by images of Finch, Sav returns to the scene of Andyâs beating hoping to make sense of it all and finds a loaded gun concealed under a loose floorboard. At that moment Finch returns, but Sav stands his ground and makes a split second decision that changes the course of his life and career.
