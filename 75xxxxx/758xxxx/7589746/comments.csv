,grfam,2012-09-01T20:03Z,thank you! and what about aerosoft frankfurt-hahn x fro fsx? any chances?
,_SnakEye,2012-09-01T20:31Z,"only Aerosoft - Mega Airport Frankfurt X 1.05

,Felidae17,2012-09-02T00:28Z,"Take care!Huge problem with this torrent. Scenery.cfg smashed to 2 Ko.
After uninstall VFR airfieldtraffic file also killed for all  VFR sceneries by Aerosoft. 
Followed the instructions. May a problem with the crack in my configuration?? "
,grfam,2012-09-02T13:52Z,"dear snakeye, do you have the latest version of aerosoft munich for fsx? the version should be 1.03. upload would be very much appreciated! :)"
,_SnakEye,2012-09-02T18:35Z,"Felidae17 , I installed it and had no issues, it is strange."
,Felidae17,2012-09-03T08:58Z,"_SnackEye: It happened after copying the PCC files.No aks to ovewrite but a renaming in .blob  of the files which should be overwrited. Then the scenery .cfg was  only 5 lines lang! The VFr traffic file disapeared with the uninstall of the scenery 11 ( I also have 5 others German VFR) Thanks the back ups restauring the before situation was not too hard. No explanation. I know your cracks are clean and works  5/5.
Maybe something with my rig. Thanks for all what you do for the community. -:)"
,_SnakEye,2012-09-03T18:53Z,"that is strange, I usually delete all those blob files and then copy the PPC BGL files, I don't keep them both even though i used to in the past and i didn't had any issues in the past.

,Taco92,2012-09-03T20:50Z,Thank you man!! 
,grfam,2012-09-03T20:59Z,"i think that aerosoft installer is messing around with scenery.cfg file especially when you have a lot of aerosoft's german sceneries. i always make a copy of scenery file before aerosoft installation and then add new entries manualy using the backup scenery.cfg file, just to be on the safe side"
,aarque,2012-09-04T03:46Z,"grfam has the correct procedure. Always, always, always keep at least one back-up of your current scenery.cfg. The ""blob"" files are a joke by Aerosoft, they do nothing. In a scenery folder, FSX reads only .bgl. Delete them or leave them, it makes no difference. And yes, Matthias Cock (my spelling) is the type who would feel it is legitimate to destroy your scenery.cfg document if the installer detects ""piracy."" A couple of false positives for paying customers will eventually make him regret his...paranoia, for lack of a better term."
,grfam,2012-09-06T23:26Z,"whether the add on is legit or not, aerosoft installer likes to mess up scenery.cfg file"
