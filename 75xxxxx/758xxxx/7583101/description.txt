Storage Wars: Texas: Out of Af-Ricky
The buyers venture to Cedar Hill, Texas--home of the rich and fabulous Dr. Moe Prigoff. Jenny Grumbles tries to toast Victor for a locker filled with chotskies. Bubba journeys alone to the heart of storage darkness. Mary tries to keep Moe from losing his mind and buying a locker filled with BBQ sauce. And Victor brings his truck to sweep the competition. From civil war prosthetics to voodoo statues--one buyer will curse his locker and one locker will curse its buyer.
