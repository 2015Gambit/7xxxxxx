As for the episode numbering, TV Rage considers the show's home page the authoritative source. In this case,
http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars-texas/episode-guide/
lists 6 episodes in season 1 (""Texas Sold 'Em"" through ""Remember the Alamo?"") and shows season 2 starting with ""Home on the Strange"" and currently having 16 episodes, which matches

[V],psspss,2012-08-30T15:43Z,"oh well I went with the stupid scene cappers and even renamed them to match LOL
prob cos there was no gap in the airing perhaps?
so they merged?

another series thats going to get messy by looks

might be a-e only just updated the listings"

I Googled for this show with no lucky.

Thanks"
,chrede2750,2012-08-31T12:52Z,"I love this series .. but I think the video quality could be better than this!
it is converted down so much that it is blurry in some parts of the section and it destroys the episode very much! . 
video 5/10 
audio 7/10 
pls upload in HD "
,profankkk,2012-08-31T19:27Z,"Disappointed with the quality, I'd say it's a 6/10."
[V],psspss,2012-09-01T03:06Z,"stop bitching.. 

instead why dont you rish sourcing a higher bitrate
and sharing it yourselves

im not here to be the 720p provider for big screen twits

the quaslity is just perfect for laptop
not different then other 360p rips

I may not share my web grabs in future of this series anyhow.. will be cutting back

I take scene still ahvent release their HD versions still"
,mrbobo001,2012-09-01T19:46Z,"Thanks for the up, love the show. . . NOTHING wrong with A/V. . . Forget those fools!"
,profankkk,2012-09-02T00:29Z,"Nothing wrong with a/v? Bitch please...
It's a blurry rip (compared to other standard 200 MB rips) and if you cannot see that you're either in denial or blind."
[V],psspss,2012-09-02T06:02Z,"a few typos before.. anyhow

you must be the new generation that dont know how good they got it now..

some of us grew up with really blurry b&w tv which we thought at the time was magic

and then came bad vhs tapes

but yeah the bit rate was a little lower then normal which only affect the intro with soem pixels is all. 

its not a mp4 remember so more you scale it the more your see pixels=blurry

I have to watch my data cap now days and if I can save 50mb here and there I will

Im not a big fan of this version of the show I like the orig better so I didnt want Hres but a watchable version and less data means also less drive space to store the collection tioo"
,profankkk,2012-09-02T07:31Z,"I was born in 1981. We didn't have black and white tvs back then but it was nothing too fancy either.

I'm totally grateful that there are torrents for this show since that's the only way for me to watch it but does that mean I cannot rate it if my opinion happens to be negative?

I'm not sitting here yelling and demanding better rips, all I'm doing is rating it which you gotta expect people to do.

In this particular case, I was disappointed with the overall quality of the rip because all of my other episodes of this series has been top notch."

HERES a tip how to rid the BLURRINESS

use VLC it has 2 great features over other players

1) audio can play at 1.5 and 2x speed and can watch a show faster without any loss in quality
or sound like mickey mouse

its a brilliant feature

2) enable the real time SHARPENER and scroll the knob a little to the right until find the sweet spot
if do it too much it will go from blurry to over pixelated

I have that enabled all the time now

however VLC 1.1.11 is the best version

the sound stutters and video jitters in VLC 2.x releases and still not fixed in beta versions

however i like the blue bar in 2.x and not the old
time scroll in VLC1.1.11

lets hope they sort it out big time"
,negativeions,2012-09-05T02:37Z,Video quality is shit. Also this is season 3. A duuuh.
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T07:20Z,"no the original storage wars is season 3

if you think its shit dont download 360p web rips then


however this is E15-16 according to A&E site
so the cappers rolled it back wrongly
"
,lockedup1,2012-09-06T08:07Z,"Thanks for sharing. Don't listen to these fools. Yes, the quality isn't the best - but it's very much watchable. I watched on my 43"" tv and it was good enough. Scene hasn't released these episodes yet, so I am grateful you did.

Perhaps people got disappointed because you added ""HQwebrip"" in the title. Anyway, thanks man."
[V],psspss,2012-09-06T11:42Z,"Ive stated befote the tags meaning
as some say web-dl or webrip it has little meaning
so I do

LQwebrip = lower them 400 bitrate

MQwebrip = bitrate 500 to 800

HQwebrip = bitrate 800 or greater


since they mp4 streams.higher quality. 800 is like xvid with 1000bitrate

i think 720p would be XQwebrip - extreme quality

where its 720p and also like 1500 bitrate but i dont
do streams like that as it kills the data cap quicker

not stopping someone else ripping streams and doing it..

I only do xvids quality.. lower since it worse then
what the media coys use or sell so what I do shouldnt upset them at all

plus xvids play on more older gear"
