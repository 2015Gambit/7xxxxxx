h*ttp://w*ww.parallels.c*om/upgradepd8

* Stupid database errors. Remove all * from link

This torrent is useless because it is pre-order until 09/14/2012/ and no will share a serial until is officially released!"

Maybe this time the link work without error."
,ClayMan812,2012-09-01T02:21Z,Thanks for link FastForwarder. Much faster and trustworthy. Why would an idiot like ruinered upload something easy to download and without a crack or serial.
,qskenzer,2012-09-01T18:15Z,Worthless
,venomblue,2012-09-01T23:03Z,Downloaded directly from Parallels. Requires Internet activation 
,egeorge2,2012-09-03T23:47Z,anyone know if this program works?
,thefog71,2012-09-04T08:58Z,"@egeorge2... YES is does work "" IF YOU HAVE A SERIAL"" for activation. So like what others said here. THIS TORRENT IS A WASTE OF TIME!!!! 
and PLS read the ""Note: This is just an INSTALLER""
Meaning if you have PD7 still up and running, Do not
download this torrent unless you have serial (For PD8)  or a good heart pirate can share a working serial for this? ...so right now this torrent is ""WORTHLESS""!!!!!!!!"
,topjimmy68,2012-09-06T20:25Z,Another direct link to download the [always] latest version is http://www.parallels.com/directdownload/pd8
,thefog71,2012-09-07T12:17Z,"Again unless a good hearted pirate would share a 
""working serial""? these torrents just for people who can afford..har had had"
,thefog71,2012-09-07T12:19Z,"oh well useless without a ""working serial"" har har had"
