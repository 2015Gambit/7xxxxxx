There's hardly any food either. I have to escape or I'm going to die here.
I have to use my wits to escape!
Your mission is only to escape from the room by opening the door. However, to do this, you'll need to gather some items and use those items in solving puzzles.
The rules are very simple. You can tap various locations, and you can also flick when you need to move about the room.
