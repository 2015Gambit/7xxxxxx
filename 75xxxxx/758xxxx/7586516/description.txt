Aalsteinn Gumundsson, a laptop ambient producer and computer science junkie from Iceland, has been involved with electronic music since the early '90s. Apart from his alias as Yagya, Gumundsson creates his music on computer with figures like Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Maurizio, and Wolfgang Voigt providing inspiration. Like a lot of his peers and influences, Gumundsson aims to compose material that sounds as organic and as free-flowing as possible.
