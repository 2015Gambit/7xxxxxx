[HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Software - IDM Computer Solutions - uedit32 - Locks]
"Updates"=dword:00000001

note -> 'replace dashes with back slashes'

Add above to registry to block being able to update (option greyed out)

Tested the release / keygen and it works just make sure you patch your hosts file first before trying to activate (it will block it from going online)
