Jimmy's Forest 
High up in a spectacular tree house, Jimmy Doherty develops an intimate understanding of the inner workings of a British forest. Country boy and farmer Jimmy Doherty is as happy as a pig in... Well, in a very nice pigsty. Holed up in a spectacular tree house, he's charting the seasonal changes of a Norfolk wood. Which means dissecting woodpeckers, eating roadkill, drinking sap from a tree and tracking deer. There are some brilliant nuggets of information and Jimmy's enthusiasm for the great outdoors is very infectious.



2)  Summer 
Its summer and Jimmy's determined to see the badgers in the large sett near his tree house: an ambition which proves to be quite a challenge. He constructs super-sized fly paper, joins a ferreter at work, entertains druids, and has a rather unappetising 'boil-in-the-bag' venison lunch with a Neolithic man. Bestriding two great oaks, Jimmy Doherty's Norfolk tree house boasts two floors, a fully equipped laboratory, a crow's nest and a zip-wire for speedy getaways. "It's basically a man-shed in a tree," says the pig farmer-turned-TV-presenter.
