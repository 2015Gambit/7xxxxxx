Tech Notes
FLACs were decoded to wave and SF 8.0 was used to reassemble 
the tracks back to 1 long wave.  CEP2.0 was used to align & 
synch all 3 sources.  CEP2.0 used to adjust the volume for 
all 3 sources. Multitrack mixdown was performed using CEP2.0.  
This is a 60% SBD, 20% AUD1, 20% mix.

Notes

There was an audible line buzz running throughout the SBD
recording.  This was likely not going over the PA as the buzz
is not apparent on either of the AUD sources.  The SBD DAT
recording continued to run after the feed from the SBD had
ended and the buzz continued.  This leads me to concluded it 
was a line feed problem.  Bad cable possibly?  Because the 
recording continued after the music ended a perfect recording 
of the buzz was recorded.  This allowed me to accurately 
capture and then remove the noise throughout the recording 
very accurately without disturbing the fidelity of the 
recording.  This was done with Soundforge 8.0 using the 
highest quality setting.

The 2 AUD tapes made that night were from similar locations
as you can hear the same 'cat calls', claps, etc. on both 
recordings.  However the 2 recordings still blended well
together and had different and unique sounds.
