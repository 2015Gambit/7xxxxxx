"We started playing this song again. Let me hear you, let me hear if you're sick of all the bad news in the world.
 It's all bad news man, where's the good news? Is the good news here in Holland tonight? At Pinkpop 2002 with music
 and love? That's where I think it is. I think it's right here. Mr Chad Gracey, could you turn up the decibel level
 a little bit? Give us a little something to freaky deaky. Oh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
