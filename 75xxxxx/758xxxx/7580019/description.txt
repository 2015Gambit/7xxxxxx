First released in 1973, "Raw Power" was remixed by lead singer Iggy Pop in 1997. That CD is the LOUDEST CD in existence, and consequently one of the worst sounding due to constant clipping and distortion.

Five years later on Record Store Day 2012, a limited edition double LP of "Raw Power" was released. The first LP was the original David Bowie mix. The 2nd LP is the 1997 mix remastered by Kevin Gray, which now sounds a LOT better.

This is a needledrop of the 2nd LP. Not my rip, but I've converted it to 44.1KHz/16-bit from the 96kHz/24-bit files, and attenuated the noise between the songs. That's it; no automatic noise reduction was used.
