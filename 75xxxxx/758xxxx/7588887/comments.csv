,sadsack_in_China,2012-09-01T08:37Z,So you're saying we've spent 2 weeks downloading 30% and now we have to start again???

And what do you mean by ""Error with the last torrent"" Just remove and reload the torrent file if the files are going bad check your hard disks. if it is not seeding it is obviously because you are over loading your connection just upload one torrent at a time and only post the next one after all the files have been seeded out.

It's starting to look like this is all bullshit and you are taking us all for a ride with no intentions of fully uploading these torrents.
For example with the Metallica torrent I happened to have the files for I have seeded more in the last hour than you have the entire time you have been running the torrent. My connection is mostly being used for other stuff with little bandwidth to spare for that torrent. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? SEED MOAR!"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-01T20:28Z,I had them seeded they were not transferring anything.
,CTR-3000,2012-09-01T20:55Z,"Apparently you are using uTorrent 3.1.3

In Preferences under bandwidth what are your Number of connections settings?
Most people think more upload slots means faster seeding and downloading but this is not the case. If this is set too high you will be bombarded with upload requests leaving no bandwidth for actual data transfer.

Try Global max 500
peers per torrent 50
and upload slots 8"

,sadsack_in_China,2012-09-03T05:25Z,"Also, if some of your torrents have completed, turn them off. They should be able to seed themselves. No one can help you seed until you have completed a torrent!"
,sadsack_in_China,2012-09-05T10:29Z,Is there any chance you are going to complete this?
