Two new songs from Stonesour: ΓÇÿGone SovereignΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿAbsolute ZeroΓÇÖ open the next album, and set up everything to come. In Corey Taylor's words, "These are the first two songs on House of Gold and Bones Part 1. Being the first part of a set of concept albums, 'Gone Sovereign' is essentially the overture and 'Absolute Zero' is the Hero's anthem. It is the best way to introduce you to this new world. For more background, you'll have to wait for the full albums."

This is just a tasteΓÇªif you like it buy the new album in October!

Enjoy & Seed.
