,deathwisher08,2012-08-05T15:43Z,does this have 5.1 audio?
,shadmonk,2012-08-05T15:49Z,"the problem with request on yify site is that if they loaded a movie already that you are requesting...it will take you too it, but it is an old mkv file that is a bad omen for ps3. i want hunt for red october mp4 720p. can't get it at a descent quality and at a reasonable size. there is one, but it comes up as unsupported data. so i have tried several request at the site to no success. 

so i am requesting again HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER MP4 720P please."
,ilikebluray,2012-08-05T16:22Z,Can you include the video bit rate info also along with other details.
,wooboo,2012-08-05T17:26Z,"@deathwisher08

,Oblivilot,2012-08-05T17:27Z,"Impressive! 2G file, downloaded in less than one hour. I am STILL working on the 1080p d/l from BOZX, after the re-rip snafu. This is the real deal, and it's uber-high-quality, at very fast speeds. THANK YOU, ""YIFY""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,bender010110,2012-08-05T18:38Z,is this going to be released in 720p? normally its 720p first b4 1080?
,laazara,2012-08-05T19:28Z,"Thanks for the great rip quality at awesome size.
Is it 5.1 channel??"
,darkpython14,2012-08-05T20:29Z,"Yifi's torrents are usually 2 channel audio when it's in MP4. That's why I like him because I know they will always work on my xbox. 

Thanks Yifi!"

,messy047,2012-08-06T03:50Z,Can you please make it smaller? Thanks in advance!
,jrs_10390,2012-08-06T05:50Z,"wow...constantly bitching. yes its irritating when you spend 42 minutes downloading a movie..and a movie this size with so few seeders will take a little longer. but its free, if you dont like it, go buy the ""good copy""....if the audio is too low, USE VLC PLAYER it works. gives you 200 % audio. 
Thank you yifi...so far you have had the best track record in my opinion. every movie i DL, I check to see if you have it first. "
,SimplyCynical,2012-08-06T06:00Z,@shadmonk When you go to yify-torrents.com click on the FAQ and he explains how you can make it playable on other devices.
,jrs_10390,2012-08-06T06:12Z,"oh and I meant to ask (even though I'm sure it's annoying to have everyone ask on here) It would be AWESOME if you could upload the Taken mini series from 2002. It was amazing and I'd like to see it again, but can't find it anywhere."
,samvirus,2012-08-06T07:32Z,plz upload this movi on small size

,paul211b,2012-08-07T13:57Z,Please can someone tell me why the audio is rubbish stereo only. People giving his torrents A10 are crazy. A bluray rip needs 5 channel sound or what's the point?

,Kobraman88,2012-08-08T05:53Z,"just downloaded it and the film is very laggy for me, thought i'd restart me laptop just incase and when i tried the film again it did the same thing 
from what i could tell the quality is pretty decent and the sound seemed ok aswell 
but will have to download another version seeing as it doesnt work properly for me.
had one of them stupid scene repeats copies b4 this and that worked fine"
,Powerslave0,2012-08-08T06:12Z,"Yeah it's 2GB, with a 2.1 audio track.  If it were AC3, it would be better."
,143love,2012-08-09T00:40Z,does this movie have subs?
,oldtimer48,2012-08-10T02:34Z,"A/10, V/10, no repeated scenes, thank you YIFY"
,riob,2012-08-10T20:53Z,"Thanks YIFY.

,johnpaulmathew,2012-08-11T11:11Z,Could anyone tell me if the TPB is down or not plz... Bcoz im getting speeds upto 10-15 kb/s only for the past 3 days. Usually i get 450-460 kb/sec.

,Rothi1,2012-08-13T08:33Z,"Audio is broken...

Video lags a lot, and tears up!

download at ur own risk!!!!!!!"
,Rholin,2012-08-14T10:59Z,"Nicely done. Thanks for the torrent. I've only watched it on my laptop, so I can't give accurate rating numbers. Audio is fine and video had 2 x 1second hiccups, but other than that, everything ran smoothly."
,mobin_t1992,2012-08-17T08:54Z,"I don't know who you are, or how you compress this files, But GOD Bless You and Keep them coming, i download only YIFY from now on. ;)"
,ATO1982,2012-08-17T08:57Z,"@Kobraman88 
Dude, your computer can't handle the video file. I'm pretty sure that's why."
,JonOyer,2012-08-18T03:34Z,"@johnpaulmathew

I haven't had any issues with speed from TPB at all. I don't think its been down, I've been downloading at around 5Mb/s like I normally do. Maybe its just the files you have been downloading?"
,kraziiadam2,2012-08-19T12:53Z,I just don't understand how any movie can be 2GB in 1080p.
,BR_iZ_NSAN3,2012-08-20T02:33Z,"Could someone explain to me how a movie of this quality on blue-ray + itz size could be 2 gig. Im not doubting the rips quality, im downloading it right now. I'm just curious how it works and how much different it would be form a ""normal"" rip."
,Geekwoman,2012-08-21T05:04Z,"Shared to 3.55GB  Looks great!  Sounds great.  Thank you YIFY, once again!  Never a bad quality rip from you. Cheers!"
,barno001,2012-08-22T10:44Z,thanks YIFY.  always reliability.  always quality.  thank you.
,glendhul,2012-08-22T21:31Z,Quality rip. No repeated scenes. Thank you for this. 
,Mullard37,2012-08-22T22:37Z,"NOT HIGH RES, and a 1080p BR rip at 2GB? Why not just download the damn dvd rip then?  This is slightly better than DVD at best.  Honestly doesn't look very good.

Also- what's worse than DVD, is that the audio is in stereo only...

YIFY needs to stop uploading into the highres section...and also provide more details about the damn torrent."
,oc17nt,2012-08-24T05:19Z,Thank you YIFY here you are again with another great movie with awesome quality!!!
,squash34,2012-08-28T03:50Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD YIFY'S TRASH.
,mrexitus,2012-08-28T20:39Z,"For all who wonders why it has only 2gigs: yify uses mp4 with h.264 codec, which is much more efficient than xvid or something. But its also more cpu intensive, so you need better hardware to play it. And of course, only 2.1 audio. So 2GB 1080p rip doesn't necessarily means poor quality."

,taxso,2012-08-31T21:25Z,"If ur having problems with lag on highres videos. Get ""Windows Media Player Classic"". I think it also exists for mac, but after the last three updates for VLC it has been lagging immensly on highres videos."
,sodtrex,2012-09-03T03:39Z,"If you dl this file, and use xilisoft dvd creator 6, you can adjust the audio settings to dd. this works...100%. I've done it many times with his dl's....Awesome....thanks for all the great movies!!

,sodtrex,2012-09-03T03:43Z,And if you have a problem with his rips...then why the f::k are you posting comments on his wall??? go dl from someone else...losers....
,weaping_reaper,2012-09-08T10:31Z,"@taxso Thanks alot Dick, I just downloaded and installed  ""Windows Media Player Classic""  and it killed my fuckin buzz, that program blows dude, VLC will own all media players until the end of time."
,YZF-R1,2012-09-09T21:41Z,"Good quality rip. The subtitles are really bad though, probably 50% of all sentences have at least one error in them, and quite major ones at that..."
