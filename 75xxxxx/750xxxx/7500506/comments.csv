,rtgiez101,2012-08-05T04:02Z,"Great cam !
A_9
V_7 
has some distortions in it but it is still one of the best ive seen in a long time !"
,buseireann,2012-08-05T16:00Z, Its not the best of cam's at all. Its very blurred and not watchable. Wait a bit longer for a non blurred one.
,Fritz.,2012-08-05T16:05Z,"the first hour and 20 minutes of the movie is audio 8 video 8

the last 30 minutes of the movie is audio 8 video 3


the reason i rate the last 30 minutes so low is its dark and you cant see anything thats happening.

you still get the idea of the story, but all the animation for the last 30 minutes is missed.

the movie was decent. they did a good job of making the little red headed girl adorable, but otherwise its a fairly predictable happy ending story."
,peterpaul52,2012-08-08T08:29Z,"Don't download this torrent, shows alot of seeds but it will not start, one of those torrent that just hangs at 0.8%."
,ironymon,2012-08-08T09:22Z,"When ppl say don't download, i do the opposite, download it. Fucking bunch of idiots."
,Dycon,2012-08-08T11:31Z,"Somewhere around half movie or so, a guy was walking by the camera blocking it!!! I yell at it ""Sit your ass down!!""
and my mom hit me in the head ""whats wrong with you..."", we're watching it with a projector so give me a break...
V/7
A/7 (home theater... i guess any audio will sound ok.. I guess)
M/9 

This is one of those few movies worth to be seen at the theater, which we will do this weekend... 
Thank you for this T... and Thank you TPB..."
,Violentos,2012-08-09T06:25Z,So I still don't understand why this version wasn't available months ago! Why did it take so long for a good quality cam to emerge?
,katazena,2012-08-10T03:21Z,wow than you sooooooo much! my son has been waiting forever for this movie

Many thanks uploader and seeders"
,REWAMAORI,2012-08-17T17:56Z,"very dark most of the movie but still watchable 
A:8
V:5
Thanks for uploading tho"
,legio9,2012-08-17T20:03Z,"Let it be known that I  got nothing against this particular uploader, but as he is one of the major uploader, he is one of the primary reason why the web is flooded with sub standard torrents...as this one.

Based on VIEWING quality, no matter the format
( The idiots who base rating on format simply compared shit with shit).

10 been a perfect blueray, 9 been a prefect DVD, and 8 a perfect ""other format such as .MKV :


V= 4
A= 4

Below sub standard. Watchable if your life depends on it or if bandwidth is free for you.

Amateur work.

I Usually just ignore this kind of comment but I will answer saying that YOU are the amateur shit!
It does make a lot of sense to compare cam quality, everyone not retarded knows that cam is not good, but certainly there are ones better then others.
Now to say its amateurs work...OF COURSE it is amateur!! DO YOU ACTUALLY NOW A PROFESSIONAL CAMERA MAN THAT GOES TO THE CINEMA AND RECORDS THE PLAYING FILM??? OR A PROFESSIONAL VIDEO ENCODER WHO WORKS WITH TORRENTS????"
