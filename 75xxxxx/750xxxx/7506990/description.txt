Episode 5 : The Capture of Saddam Hussein 

Eight months after the fall of Baghdad, on 13th December 2003, U.S. Special Forces launched Operation Red Dawn just nine miles from Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, resulting in the infamous capture of the fugitive dictator.

This episode of the compelling Zero Hour series reconstructs the final hour of this raid based on the previously unknown testimony of Samir, an Iraqi Shia Muslim, who was acting as a translator for the US special-forces and who helped pull Saddam from his final hiding place.

It is a particularly personal and poignant viewpoint from a man driven from his country 12 years previously by Saddam's regime, but who returned and extracted his revenge.
