I am just letting people know and trying to spread the word.  I will be putting my comments back up and if you remove them again I will take down this torrent and stop seeding it.  Don't ruin this for everyone else because you feel like you need to be a dick."
,killhawk,2012-08-14T04:21Z,great show great quality will seed when i can  
,prozoxo,2012-08-14T22:58Z,"saul, there is an issue with the files - they can't be converted to be watched on a ps3 with any program I've tried.  They can't be streamed with tversity either.  A lot of us use our ps3 to watch vids, so would you mind posting this in Divx format?  That would be awesome."
,saulwhite,2012-08-15T17:52Z,@prozoxo Have you tried converting them to .M4V with Handbreak?  I ripped them all in H.264 so it should be able to convert them.  If not I can try and convert them over and put a version up.
,prozoxo,2012-08-15T18:46Z,"saul, I don't think the ps3 will play m4v.  Divx is the easiest for ps3, or mp4 - although mp4 can have problems if not done right.  If you can create any type files that will work on ps3 and post them that would be great.  Thanks for the work u put in"
,prozoxo,2012-08-17T05:51Z,"just an update - i decided to try handbrake to convert to mp4 and it works just fine on the ps3.  I figured since that was the program used to rip the file, it would be the best to convert it and it was.  Problem solved.  Quality is great.  Thanks again Saul"
