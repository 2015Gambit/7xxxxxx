This is the first season of the Showtime series The Franchise.  This is a DVD rip of, as there is no Blu-Ray version available.  I ripped this as high of quality as Handbrake would allow.  I decided to buy and rip this as I could not find any decent quality version anywhere, and want to share it with others to enjoy.  This is a great series for any baseball fan.  All files are .MKV format, nine files are included.  Please feel free to re-package if wanted and share this with as many people as possible.  Enjoy!
