,Chaos1337,2012-08-08T11:13Z,"Whats diffrent about this one?

Because T.F.K already has another dawnguard up??

Anyone know the diffrence between the two?"
,Alucard8125,2012-08-08T13:28Z,"For everyone asking what is the difference between this torrent and the other dawnguard torrent TFK uploaded is that this one comes with an update , because certain people couldn't play with dawnguard enabled.  And Please People Seed , the torrent is realy slow  :)"

,dryimpact,2012-08-13T02:32Z,"Thank you TFK this works for me. I just got confused about your instructions, maybe next time you can put your instructions in your upload too because after i downloaded this i still went back here, oh maybe i just didnt read first.

I have the upload of RAZOR and i didnt update anything and i dont have any mods. And i just followed the step to make the grayed out DATA FILES visible. I tried to attack while im on the horse and it works. And i went to the gate and someone just approach me for dawnguard."
,fausber,2012-08-16T16:48Z,"Can someone, please explain what do I have to do? I can't quite follow the instructions..."
,oldbreadbutt,2012-08-18T00:55Z,"thank TFK gonna give this one a shot.

,waffle165,2012-08-23T00:05Z,"how come i keep on getting this error that says: ""The program can't start because steamapi.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling this program to fix the problem"" I put in all the patches and stuff but it keeps putting that up!! PLEASE HELP!!!"
