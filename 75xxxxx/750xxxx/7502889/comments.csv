Honestly don't know what all the hype about this was. Lacked many qualities of a blockbuster movie. The most exciting part was the games starting, but as they progressed it lost the punch. Seemed like a lot of senseless murder and the writers of this film have some serious psychological issues. 

Not a movie recommended for kids. "

Now, if u mind minor glitches, buy the F'in ticket, or a dvd.

U know, that type of behavior (complainin ' and winin', and always fucking wanting MORE) is The Picture of the world today. 
HELLO! U R COMMENTING ON A PIRATE BAY, motherfu***r, u do not have any legal rights to HAVE these files, and people who post'em here ARE WORKING HARD to get them, the best they can, for YOUR SORRY EYES to see, all FOR FREE, and they are risking pretty much their way of living and social reputation, not to mention fines and lawyer costs, jail time ... .

You know, when I see this kind of things, I kinda doubt ANARCHY, DEMOCRACY, LIBERAL WAY OF THINKING, and all other ideas or movements are good for humanity at this point.

BOOT IS WHAT U NEED, u FUCKS! BOOT in the head, tape over your mouth, and complete ignoration of society. 
And this is one liberal dude speaking!

As for the movie, honestly, I expected lot less. So, EXCELLENT VIDEO AND AUDIO, and movie is around 7, which is pretty high, for my taste ...

Yes, there are few (3 I think) looped clips (or, not exactly looped, they r repeated), but not too long, and nothing of the movie is missing.

So, THANX, AND RESPECT, EXTREMEZONE!"

But the movie did that on its own what a piece of crap boring and pointless. the cities looked like cg cartoons very rushed.  the story OF the movie anyway IM sure different in the book, really had nothing to do with the title. I thought it was gonna be some movie about people fighting for food or something but was just stupid. 

All this movie was is a remake of running man. the makers of running man should sue these ass clown for even making this movie. Pointless piece of garbage but hey what do you exspect being made in north carolina to cut cost.

I live right by the film studio here in wilmington and its a shit hole they are so gonna fuck up iron man 3 that they are filming here.. The people in north carolina are morons.

Then they had to add in the stupid love intrest to make the girls panties all wet because of those stupid ass twilight films. 

I think they should have made her kill her boyfriend atthe end of the games instead of giving in and letting them both live god who couldnt see that coming from the bigining of the movie. oh and liek any movie of corse everyone gets killed except her and her little pussy ass boyfriend go figure. stupid ass movie  go back and watch running man and see how this kind of movie should have been made.  oh wait thats right they allready made it in the 80's its called running man.  hollywood is so out of ideas."

I don't know what it is that you people are seeing exactly. I notice no scenes repeating. I never saw this movie in theaters, so I can't say that its exactly the same. However I can say, I didn't noticed any scenes playing back. Every scene that I saw played back was a planned flashback. They should have done a better job at portraying a flashback, because I can see how it might appear as a random scene appearing. It was all the same scene though. The rainy day with the guy and the pigs, which was planned as a flashback. If that isn't the scene you see, then maybe you should try playing the movie using a different player. 

I had no problem with it playing on the computer, or when I streamed it to the xbox for the family."

It's really not a big deal. The video and audio quality is perfect. You miss nothing and it only cuts back to earlier scenes so there are no spoilers. (It's not like it randomly jumps ahead to the climax during the first few minutes)

The sound is low volume. And the movie skips scenes. What give man? With your rep man you need to fix this.  Several scenes are repeated and skip over others.

Dont waste your time if you havnt seen this movie, it will just confuse you. 

Otherwise Extremezone is legit, I just dont know whats up with this one"

,paulyhart,2012-08-27T04:33Z,"thank you for the movie. i am always up for watching a great dytopian flick, and this one, once you strip away all the girlish bullshit, is a great glimpse into a plausible future. watching shows like this makes me want to support the people even more than i do now. down with the systems that control us, freedom of information and thought. freedom of life and the pursuit of knowledge and higher learning outside the established norms of society. please remember to spread movies like this out there on the nets as much as possible. seed pray learn and grow."

,kooopa,2012-09-02T23:48Z,"movie was conveyed decently running on a pg-13 rating; rated R would've been ideal. not enough senseless killing and clashing robots for your primitive minds, i guess."
