WORKDONE:

Took the video first and cleaned up the noise,thenn slightly changed the rgb colours and increased the sat.
Then fine tuned the brightness and contrast levels,before finally adding some sharpness back.

Audio is line but not the greastest  had loads of noise and like a hum/buzzer sound that comes and goes.
So had too clean the audio the best we could ...changing all the EQ band levels and also used  hiss remover filter.
Most of the noise is now gone but the buzzer sound is still there but not as loud now.
After we syncd it too the video we did.


EXTRA NOTES:
Why didn't we use the HDCAM....because we have some friends that are doing that using the sync job were sending them.
This way users get the best of both worlds  Because there is faults on both videos.
This one is longer runtime and doesn't flicker as bad ....the HDCM source is alot sharper,but has less runtime and 
flicker is worse.

Anyway users will now be able to pick which suits them best "
