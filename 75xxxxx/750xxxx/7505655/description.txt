
NES Emulator + Games


FCEUX is a cross platform, NTSC and PAL Famicom/NES emulator that 
is an evolution of the original FCE Ultra emulator.  Over time FCE 
Ultra had separated into many separate branches.  

The concept behind FCEUX is to merge elements from FCEU Ultra, FCEU 
rerecording, FCEUXD, FCEUXDSP, FCEUXDSP CE, and FCEU-mm into a single 
branch of FCEU.  As the X implies, it is an all-encompassing version 
of the FCEU emulator that provides the best of all worlds for the 
general player, the ROM-hacking community, and the Tool-Assisted 
Speedrun Community.
