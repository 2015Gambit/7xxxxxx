World's Greenest Homes travels to Minneapolis, MN where a 1,800 square foot home in the suburbs features the owners' own dumpster finds, a reclaimed gymnasium floor, huge picture windows, and a durable, future-proof design.
Next, it's off to Boulder, CO where a three-bedroom, 2,900 square foot home is built from eco-friendly materials, and features a noise-proofing concrete wall, soaring ceilings and windows, open concept living areas, bright design flourishes, and an indoor fish pond.
Finally, in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, nestled in the picturesque countryside, is an open concept green dream home that features outstanding minimalist design, solar panels and passive solar heat, as well as a dramatic floating staircase, a spa-like bathroom, a fish-filled reflecting pool, and dramatic views from the home's large windows and second-story bridge.
