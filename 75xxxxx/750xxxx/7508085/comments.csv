,Raphi_k,2012-08-06T11:43Z,The audio track seems to be out of sync.
,goaxan,2012-08-06T12:07Z,The whole video is out of sync. NOT watchable!
,ExtraTorrentz,2012-08-06T12:38Z,"eztv I like your uploads, but you have to stop making these out of sync releases. 

Since it's been going on for quite some time, are you doing it for a reason cuz its not watchable?"
,MikeStig19,2012-08-06T14:03Z,yeah it is out of sync. hopefully eztv will upload a repack but until then here is a good link to a online stream. http://www.thedarewall.com/tv/continuum/season/1/episode/10
,lentheric,2012-08-06T14:37Z,"@extratorrentz

EZTV just release tv-rip and dont do the rips themselves, if you look at the title you will see it is 2HD who did this one.

Some times they rush to be first to release or just try to release quickly and make a mistake like syncing the audio correctly. It happens, it has nothing to do with eztv. A repack has been released so download that, audio is in sync. "
,MikeStig19,2012-08-06T14:50Z,ah I see
,dante107,2012-08-06T15:00Z,"out of sync

,AreJustBest,2012-08-06T16:57Z,Can ppl please stop seeding when the torrent is fucked up
,acsmith1972,2012-08-06T23:59Z,"How do these people make it out of sync. Is there some button they hit like a ""fuck it up"" button? "
,rodmapim,2012-08-07T05:26Z,"Don't waste your time, this sync is garbage!!"
,MikeStig19,2012-08-07T07:12Z,"Who knows what's involved when syncing audio, therefor I think it's best not to assume anything. they released a repack about 20 minutes after this one so i'm happy :)"
