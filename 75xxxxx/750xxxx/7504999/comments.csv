[V],psspss,2012-08-05T04:34Z,"that guy who keeps talking about darn flares for Phoenix sightings and was also the same guy going on about  the Kiakora lights
in NZ as venus and squad boats is a bloody joke
it was no way boat lights reflecting of clouds
(some witnesses even claimed they saw beam of lights coming down light they were searching for something e.g. another UFO that crashed in the sea perhaps??)

how come if it was flares that the last so called flare dropped was the first to stop emitting light and the very first light came on was the last.. flares dont behave like that

most probable though is the airforce order to drop flares as a cover story.. now your talking"
,DeanMachine16,2012-08-05T04:51Z,"Sweeet. 
I can never get enough UFO specials.
Looking forward to this. :-)"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T04:55Z,"lol not sure why other torrent has stats.. and this one none.. I even changed the block size in torrent.. it shouldnt be working.. perhaps its not

why did tpb disable the delete.. cant wait for demon to come back.. atleast they had that function"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T04:57Z,well its been up for a day in MP4 format from tne this is just seeding now 10 percent seeded out only and just me seeding it.. will take a 1-2 hours to seed out though.. make sure to peer block the fake seeders with peerblock 1.1 (the new version is pretty good like the old PG2 and works in win7)
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T05:25Z,"
just watching properly now for first time

hmm looks like its still slight sync problem

needs +100ms I think to correct.. I leave you
to adjust or fix with own soft
its minor

use avimuxgui a free tool..

whats it with some mp4s never syncing properly when converting.. all soft fails 
all do it with certain mp4s not all the same mp4s LOL"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T06:24Z,"avidemux.org is good to fix sync also

tick time shift and enter 100 and file save as avi
again.

however align of interleave will slip.. 
only way to fix that is above tool or avidemux.org
chane audio to lame mp3 from copy
and mp3 cbr 128 and tick disable disable resonoir

I redid this copy thatr way and all is sync-ed
and tool a few minutes as didnt need to reencode"
[M],Q91,2012-08-05T09:51Z,I deleted 2 of our torrents as they where said to be out of Sync. I presume that was OK?
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T10:00Z,:O
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T10:04Z,"I sometimes have to comment with face first
as the comments dont show for some reason
even clearing cache

and to the question
yes there were 2 I couldnt delete.. I added a comment stating so mod would see
so looks fine cheers

sadly though this one is still out of sync here but 
its got 40 seeders and is easily fixed if people
want to keep it using above tools.. pays to learn them as its simple to fix OOS avis normally"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-08-05T12:40Z,"Thanks for the xvid, psspss. But the 10 PM Phoenix lights WERE flares. :) Download and watch this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6074986/UFO_s_Over_Phoenix_%281997%29_-_Discovery_Channel_Documentary"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T12:55Z,:D
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T12:58Z,"ive watched all docus on it.. 

flares also dont hang in the sky and also have smoke trails

if you see the sky divers they did on chasing ufos
a few episodes back at night you can clearly see
how flares look.. 

even if the flares have parachutes why did the
first flare dropped not be the first flare to go out
it was reverse order"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T13:12Z,"have a read of this
http://www.oracleofthephoenix.com/triangulation.html

its not maccabee is saying.. the lights 100miles of
from the said flare drop unless im reading it wrong

can always trust maccabee to do a proper job"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T13:17Z,"and this is good reading also

still flares you say... hmmmm
seems to me there were 3 events that happened that night some saw flares and the others saw 2 light events

http://rense.com/general75/flares.htm"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-08-05T13:23Z,"Whatever, man. The analysis done in that documentary I mentioned absolutely, positively proves they were flares. But believe what you want to.

Am watching this documentary you uploaded now and right away there is a huge mistake in it. It claims there is no video of the 8:30 V over Phoenix. But that isn't true. It was filmed by Terry Proctor... also mentioned in that other doc I recommended. Analysis of his video shows that the lights in the V change formation slightly as time goes on. In other words it wasn't a rock-solid V like some of the witnesses claim. Considering that the position changed it was almost certainly planes flying in formation.

I am by no means trying to be a debunker here. There are UFO cases I consider to be unexplainable, especially some close encounter stories like Kelly Cahill, Betty and Barney Hill, and Pascagoula. But the 1997 Phoenix lights account is a total dud."
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T13:33Z,"this is a good read too.. 
http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread31656/pg3

so I can see why they saying the first flare dropped
was last to go out as the others went behind a mountain range.. really? how come I didnt see
a range when ufo hunters did their day filming

beats me.. but its not the first time a large craft like this has been spotted.. they seen all over the world"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T13:38Z,"just keeping an open mind..

of course he could of filmed the jets with afterburners

but i wasnt there and some witness said it blocked out the stars as flew over head

Im not saying all the events didnt happen.. of course there were flares and jets and maybes some secret craft e.g. ufo who knows

didnt the major come forward the one with the stupid press conf stunt also say he saw the large craft..

I think more evidence and analysis has come forward since that docu though"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T13:54Z,i mean mayor not major (dont think he was ex airforce that one)
,xpmule,2012-08-05T14:58Z,"not sure where tNe got his source but there is 2 other versions..
National.Geographic.Secret.History.of.UFOs.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD This was released before tNe's version
And there is an AFG version too but i bet AFG's is a convert from DHD so if one has sync issues they prob both do right..

I have noticed for a while now that the 720p versions are uploaded all over the net ULTRA FAST !
And the lower resolution rips can take up to 2 days to appear.
Some people may want to just grab the 720p version and watch that and or convert it afterwards yourself maybe ?"
,xpmule,2012-08-05T15:00Z,"weird i seen probably 2/3 comments and after i added my comment all of a sudden there was a fail page of them (before mine)

the comments are around here are hardcore sketchy !!!!!!"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T15:04Z,:I
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T15:07Z,"the tpb comments are odd i agress.. trrying posting a smiley face first then it shows other comments.. caching perhaps but clearing it in firefox never works for me.. so maybe its a cookie thing also

I think your find TNES was out a good 12 hours before other sources.. the 2hd came out and then afgs and others incl my version"
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T15:11Z,"the problem is most want the smallest without too much loss xvid version and many dont know how to convert or dont want too.. and like I find can have annoying sync issues when converting but atleast 
its a constant OOS not one of those that looses it one ad break or every ad break.. this is easy fix in minutes.. if need more help on syncing using tools just ask.. they all freeware too..
avimux-gui is doogy interface.. but you load avi.. click process button then click the audio stream on the  right will show a place to enter 100 and click save and it will write the new header with the sync fix.. avidemux.org is prob easier to use though and understand"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-08-05T17:31Z,"It ain't just the comment system that is buggy at tpb. This site has been a glitchy mess forever. Seems that the only ones ever to get fixed are the ones that cause the site to not work at all. If it will work with a glitch then they don't care about it. Still can't edit, can't delete torrents, special characters continue to mess up text, etc."
[V],psspss,2012-08-06T02:58Z,"i see afg encoded theirs with half the MBs for 1.5hr show the quality would have to suck..

your better with this xvid and spend 2min resync-ing the audio by adjusting the header with above method I would upload the fixed avi again but I have to save GBs on data plan.. 36gb left now for 2 weeks :/"
[V],psspss,2012-08-06T03:06Z,"heres the link to the avi header fixer tool
the interface is not great but once work it out
can fix sync issues quickly with no recodes
and even add and remove audio trackers and join
videos.. although I tried joining and it went out of sync.. so avs video converter 8.2 beat it for joining!
but I fixed this video with this tool. as said above in comment the steps

,xpmule,2012-08-10T00:53Z,"phoenix lights reports to seperate accounts.. 1 at 8pm and the 2nd one filmed and spread across the world..
The first account was close up and the people's description said it was a triangle with lights that moved slowly and silently.. i bet its a black ops project.

The UK story seems fishy, although i'm skeptical it was a light house. these people basicly live there so they have seen the light house on many occasions i'm sure and the guy said he east dinner at the restaurant there lol
the big question that came up for me is why the hell if they are at an airforce base did they not send up a plane or chopper ? The story seems fishy i think.. always a bad sign when people keep adding to the story after the fact as admitted in this show.. usualy a sign your dealing with a lier making shit up on the fly"
