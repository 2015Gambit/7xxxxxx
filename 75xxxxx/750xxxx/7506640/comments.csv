This is the sorta thing that makes TPB look like shit !

A well known / trusted seeder uploads a release properly and then someone else comes along and re-uploads it..

And unlike this this torrent the other guy displayed details on the torrent.

Your advertising is fucking irritating.

I'm getting pretty tired of see'ing people re-upload crap just so they can get a pat on the back or in this case advertise your fucking web site.

My advice to everyone around here is if you see a new torrent and you wanna download it ? Go and use the search box before downloading. Chances are you will find a better realease.. One with more seeder or even more details.
For example how many people are gonna know this the x86 version only and has the Recovery Boot CD iso installed to the ""Programs Files"" directory.

I can FULLY UNDERSTAND why people think The Pirate Bay is a toilet..
No rules for uploading = Bullshit central."

@xpmule
Thank you for your comment, which was not helpful or related to this torrent at all.
If you only come here to criticise this torrent and advertise another torrent, then why do YOU come here in the first place? Your comment makes no sense, since there's a reason people download from Games4theworld; it's because we actually test downloads prior to uploading them, add a clear installation guide, do not upload viruses and actually provide SUPPORT for our downloads. If it annoys you, then don't download and just leave, no one forced you to come to this place.
Also, before accusing us of all kinds of things, you should watch your words: this torrent DOES work with x64 too and has ALL the options the original version does. This torrent has NOT just been copied of another uploader. And if the serial codes are the same, which I doubt, are you familiar with the term ""torrenting""?

Thank you for taking the time to post such an extensive post and wasting my time to actually reply. It's The Pirate Bay that has given us the freedom that people like you try to take from us.

@fire3k
You can request games and software on our Forum, thank you!"
,LadyElDi,2012-08-07T11:03Z,"@ xpmule,

Funny how people request games and software from Games4theworld refusing to download it from anyone else. Could it be because we actually provide support for the uploads? Or because our installation guides are clear even for the beginners? Or both?

We would rather spend time writing the installation guide than a description of a program that comes with the torrent. Most of the time other uploaders don't even bother telling you how to install, how to crack. Just, there you go, this is it, now shut the F up and don't come crying to me if you don't know what to do with it.

Besides that, one would assume that downloaders research a product before deciding to download it. I've been downloading torrents for a long time and I hardly glance at the description.

And you really need to get your facts straight. Games4theworld isn't only a well known/trusted seeder, we're a popular team as well.
