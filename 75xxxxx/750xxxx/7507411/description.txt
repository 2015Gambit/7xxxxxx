They belong to each other, Nancy and Nicole--mother and daughter. They're two halves of a whole, two facets of the same breath--until the day Nicole exhales. . . and never inhales again. 

After the death of her daughter, and quickly losing her own battle with grief, Nancy decides to move from the house she can no longer bear to live in. While packing, she comes across a box in the attic. Inside this box, Nancy uncovers treasures she didn't know existed and evidence that her and her daughter's lives had been more divinely entwined than she could've imagined.

The Truth About Butterflies is a true story of grief, hope, and transformation, and a single enduring truth: Life cannot be restrained by death.
