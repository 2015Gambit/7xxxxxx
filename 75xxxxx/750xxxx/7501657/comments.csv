,notouchx,2012-08-04T07:18Z,"It extracted for me. HOWEVER, there was a big audio glitch between 15:30 and 31:00 - that's 15 minutes - where it used audio from the beginning of the show.  What was there did not seem terribly important, and the audio fixes itself before the voting closed.

tl;dr: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.  Get one of the others instead."

,notouchx,2012-08-05T00:06Z,"Repacks of all versions of this episode have been posted, fixing the audio screwup.  Looks like they all work off one source?"
