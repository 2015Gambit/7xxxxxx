,isaacteo,2012-08-06T11:47Z,SEED!!! only 72kbps on my utorrent!
,isaacteo,2012-08-06T11:49Z,is it really 720p? i hate waiting long to download movies to find out that it's in low quality.
,malowi,2012-08-06T23:44Z,"@isaacteo it probably is 720p, however that doesn't make it good quality necessarily. What is equally important to resolution is bit-rate, ie. how much data is saved per second. With 720p resolution and 650MB size I cannot expect the bit-rate to be very high, meaning the quality most likely isn't that great. However it might be very compressed and still have decent quality."
,thedarkhadoken,2012-08-07T08:41Z,I registered an account to say first that I love you YIFY and since I got my slim Ps3 last year I have only been downloading from you. Since I got a 3dtv I have only been downloading 3d movies from you as well. YIFY can you please do this movie in 1080p 3D? and can you do more 3D movies? I am running out of 3d movies to watch XD

,paul211b,2012-08-07T14:00Z,Please can someone tell me why the audio is rubbish stereo only. People giving his torrents A10 are crazy. A bluray rip needs 5 channel sound or what's the point?
,vampzcore,2012-08-08T23:58Z,thanks!!
,popelpost,2012-08-09T02:18Z,thx...
,AdnanRJ,2012-08-19T15:34Z,bad quality don't download 
,eroticburps,2012-08-22T04:33Z,"thanks YIFY..

and whats wrong with some people.
this torrent is just fine.
if you people are so particular about quality, then buy a blu-ray player and discs"
