Description:
The year is 1834. Adam Crowley, the leader of the Brotherhood of Hecate, has found and deciphered a book written by Samuel Pepys, which has granted him the power to create a race of demonic creatures for use in taking over the world. It is now up to the player to stop the evil Crowley and silence the Brotherhood's ambitions forever by assuming the role of either Father Ignatius Blackward or Nadia Ignatius. Each character has his or her own unique attack methods and combinations, all of which will be useful throughout the 16 levels of third-person perspective gameplay. While most of the time is spent in London, the player will travel through city streets, dark sewers, waterways and docks. Along the way, Crowley's minions must be dealt with. They come in the form of ravenous zombies, werewolves, flying reptilian demons, dockers, insects, and faceless men who are rumored to be former members of the Brotherhood.
