http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3462691/Nightmare_Creatures

Why is this so big?, better textures?"
[T],esharoth,2012-08-03T16:14Z,"Probably because this is a full copy of the original disc, including the CDA tracks (24 to be exact, they occupy ~480 MB). You can open the CUE sheet with a text editor to see them, or with an image editor like PowerISO to extract and convert them. You should also be able to listen to them by burning the image to a CD and putting it in a CD player.

Also, I am seeding the torrent, even though TPB doesn't show it."

[T],esharoth,2012-09-09T15:44Z,Small update: the soundtrack won't actually play in-game on modern PCs. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the OS or the hardware.
