      " Party Doll"  is a song written by Mick Jagger and released on the album "Primitive Cool". As the follow-up to Jagger's 1985 success "She's the Boss", "Primitive Cool" was another attempt by Mick to make him a solo star, being more ambitious.  Released in September 1987 with "Let's Work" as the lead single, the commercial reaction to "Primitive Cool" was not as welcoming as the reception for "She's the Boss", with the album merely reaching #26 in the UK and #41 in the United States.
      "Main Offender" is the second studio album by Keith Richards and his last to date, released in 1992 in between The Rolling Stones'  "Steel Wheels" and "Voodoo Lounge" projects. When Richards would reunite with Mick Jagger  in mid-1993 to start work on Voodoo Lounge, Jagger would compliment Richards on "Main Offender", even using lead single "Wicked as It Seems" as inspiration for The Rolling Stones' next single, "Love Is Strong".
