Sims Have Pets! Your Sims can share a lifetime with their pets. Sims can adopt dogs, cats, birds, and more. Choose from dozens of dog and cat breeds, or customize features for a unique pet and then pick their personalities.
Sit, Spike, Sit. Your Sims can encourage and discipline pets, training them to shake, play dead, and more. Unruly pets might dig in the yard, claw the sofa, topple the trash, or surprise their Sims in other ways.
Must have items for your Sims' entire family. Hang loose with Hawaiian style patio furniture and clothing or bring out the kids' adventurous side with exciting costumes.
Choose from three new architectural themes, Moroccan, Art Deco, and Second Empire, to re-imagine and re-make the exteriors of your Sims' estates.
