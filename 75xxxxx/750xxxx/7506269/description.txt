Hey guys!

Fucking tired of watching iamamiwhoami's videos only on Youtube, I made this fan-made DVD with all videos from the preludes up to ;john.

I'm in love with this project, that's why I made it.

i do hope you enjoy it.

How it works?

All you need to do is to put the files in a program like Nero and burn it. It's alread converted.

Files:


All Preludes
B.
O.
U-1.
U-2.
N.
T.
Y.
John;
Clump;

Art Cover, and a booklet.

PS: The videos (starting from 'b') have subtitles in English and Portuguese (BR)
