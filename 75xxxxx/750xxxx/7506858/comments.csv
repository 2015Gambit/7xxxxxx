This file contains episodes 1-7 of Young Justice Invasion (season 2).

For those of u like me who will watch episode 1 and go ""what the?"", this season is set 5 years after season 1 and from what i can find there is no in-between footage to show what has happened within the 5 years. It just sort of begins and u have to catch up as u go along. Apart from that it is just as good as season 1. 

Cheers"
