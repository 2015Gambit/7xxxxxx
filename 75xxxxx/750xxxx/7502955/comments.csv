,docgina,2012-08-04T15:00Z,and can you please upload federer and del potro's epic semifinal match?

,tibird,2012-08-04T21:38Z,yeah i'd like a lower resolution and it could be a smaller file. but there isnt much olympic coverage out there so i'm thankful for whatever I get. And you cant beat the price lol
