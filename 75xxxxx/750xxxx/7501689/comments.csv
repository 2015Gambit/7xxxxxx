I got even better coming that im putting a lot of work into reviving for Pirate Bay so help seed my torrents and keep the retro tv alive.

I will add to these were tagged as HD, not being a fan of HD i really wouldn't notice it in a cartoon nor a 1989 program. Either way a 23 year old show, complete to. Keep it alive."
