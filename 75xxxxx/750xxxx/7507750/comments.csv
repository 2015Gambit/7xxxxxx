,TonyYates,2012-08-06T06:14Z,"@moneyshot86 If you would click on the ""2"" after ""Files"" at the top, you would be able to tell what files are contained in the torrent, including their extensions. And so, you would know that this is an mp4 file."

,delaslow,2012-08-06T21:21Z,"For anyone that is new here, the uploader ETTV is legitimate. Always. Look for the ""By:ettv(green skull)"" in the info area up there. 

All these inquiries on whether they're real are taking up valuable ""thank you"" space. 

That being said this show is, as always, fantastic. Thanks.  "
