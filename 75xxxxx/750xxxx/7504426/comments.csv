[T],MissouriMike,2012-08-05T19:18Z,Thanks!!! I like this better than vlc.
,rawmacias,2012-08-06T14:12Z,does this come with a regis. code or crack?
,radische,2012-08-08T02:23Z,"Seems to work well ... but it tells me that an update is available. If I download the update, will the activator work with that, too?"
,next_level,2012-08-09T01:13Z,"Great bit of software, but Webroot is flagging up Malware on the activator file and when installed two components try to access the internet."
,radische,2012-08-11T01:17Z,"Next_Level ... Regarding Webroot, I'm not familiar with webroot, but with Microsoft Security Essentials, you can exclude certain files and folders from their scan. I download to an excluded folder, as I always expect an activator or a key generator to be flagged. Regarding the internet access problem, all blu-ray players need to access the internet as blu-ray security is always changing. The player can't play the disk if if doesn't know the protocol.

I'm still wondering if the activator will activate updated versions?"
