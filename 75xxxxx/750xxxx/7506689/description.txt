Xslimmer removes wasted space on your Mac's hard drive by removing the binary from either its PowerPC or Intel code (depending on the system architecture used). The result users report is that you can save 47% of your disk space. 

For example, when running Xslimmer on Google Earth 4, it shrinks the size from 101MB to 52.8MB, which is a 47% reduction. 

As the developer states, the driving goal of Xslimmer is to achieve size reduction without compromising functionality. As of version 1.2, the option to strip applications from unwanted language files and localizations is added. Version 1.2.7 improves Leopard support more...
