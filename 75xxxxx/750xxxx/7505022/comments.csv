,sbrtmt,2012-08-05T06:27Z,"Thank you for uploading, do you have the prelims?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-05T08:10Z,Unfortunately I don't get the channel for the prelims(FuelTV). Which is ridiculous.

,2743241,2012-08-06T02:22Z,Anyone else have it freeze around 6 minutes in?
,everbleed,2012-08-06T03:20Z, isn't working so well on vlc for me. freezes whenever i try to use the 'seek' function. tried watching it on km player and there's noticeable audio lag at times and the picture freezes up momentarily at times as well. any tips?
,everbleed,2012-08-06T03:43Z,scratch that. works great on WMP. great quality too.
,gibbits,2012-08-06T03:50Z,Won't play past 6 min 29 sec in VLC (which plays everything!)... Bunk upload wasted 4.5 GB of my alotted 150 GB/month.  Thanks...
,.Leto.,2012-08-06T07:23Z,"No idea what you're talking about, I watched the full event with KMPlayer and I didn't have any problem at all.
Great show btw, specially the main fight which was fantastic!!"
,nmourtos11,2012-08-06T14:35Z,"I too could not get it playing on VLC. Headed over to the other EVOLVE rip, see if that yields anything better. "
,FX155,2012-08-06T20:52Z,It plays with Windows Media Player. Crashes on VLC
,tb2zege,2012-08-08T09:01Z,I rather download a mkv.file.
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-11T09:18Z,"plays fine. you just need decent codecs and it is suggested to use windows media player for windows or gnome mplayer for linux. this is a .ts file which these programs playback best. i just changed the extension to .mp4 since it is more easily recognized. you can change it back to .ts if you want. this is the best copy you can possibly obtain of this event online, so please enjoy."
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-11T09:22Z,"and never use vlc. its an awful player. if you use something, use media player classic home cinema. suggested codecs are lav which you can add in mpchc's external filter section. you just need to install shark007's codec pack(windows 8 supported)"
,MoviesR101,2012-08-14T09:13Z,"This copy kept freezing and then it completely froze on both VLC and Media Player Classic! Avoid this copy, you have been warned"
