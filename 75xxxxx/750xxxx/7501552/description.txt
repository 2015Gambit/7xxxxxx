For developers who have learned the elegant and highly productive Ruby language, it can be a real drag to switch back to a traditional static programming tool like Objective-C. MacRuby, a Ruby 1.9 implementation that sits directly on the Mac OS X core, gives Rubyists the potential to code Cocoa apps without sacrificing the language features they've come to depend on.

MacRuby In Action is a tutorial for Ruby developers who want to code for OS X without learning Objective-C. Readers will learn the ins and outs of the MacRuby language, including straightforward examples of creating OS X applications using Cocoa components. The core of the book is an example-driven tour of the Cocoa framework from the Ruby perspective that focuses on getting things done.
