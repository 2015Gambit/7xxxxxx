TotalSpaces is a desktop manager that brings back grid Spaces to OS X 10.7 Lion and more!

Choose your transitions - Cube, slide and other effects, or turn them off altogether to really speed up your mac
Manage your desktops and windows from the Overview Grid - a birds-eye view of your grid
Hotkeys, hot-corners, circulation options and more

What's New

FIXED Some windows that shouldn't be able to be dragged between spaces cannot now be moved
FIXED Dock component crash in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion that caused blank overview grid
