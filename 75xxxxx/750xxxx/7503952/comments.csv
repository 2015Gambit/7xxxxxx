I don't think the watermark tools have been updated yet either so its risky.

I would advise leaving it alone until you get a crack or emulator etc for activation. Once you activate you will not see the watermark."
,kallstrom_74,2012-08-06T20:38Z,"you activate windows with this commands:

Run the following in a command prompt with Admin rights:

For Win 8 Enterprise:
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato"
,PirateWarden,2012-08-06T23:45Z,"@nikita200: Works great, thanks for the upload!

@all: The average speed on this torrent that I got was 700kb/s. You might get more or less depending on the amount of seeders.

@crazysha: I have just downloaded and installed it on my laptop. Works and is indeed the real deal.

@dubai1991, @darkodar9, @rgshah3, @pjanil: This torrent is different from WINDOWS.8.ENTERPRISE-N because that one does not have Windows Media Player. This version from nikita200 has Windows Media Player built in.

@rgshah3: There are no other tools needed to install unless you want to boot from a USB, then you have to use a program (eg. Universal USB Installer). Otherwise, you can burn the .iso to a DVD and boot from the DVD.

@luciferps, @pirate4053: You can get the 32bit version of Windows 8 Enterprise from the same uploader (nikita200) here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7505762/MICROSOFT.WINDOWS.8.ENTERPRISE.RTM.X86.VOLUME.ENGLISH.DVD-WZT

@mfmedia: I recommend that you use the 32bit version.

@myanktaker: The Enterprise version has more features than Pro. You can check out the differences here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8_editions

@SiN-R: All Windows 8 editions have the ability to use language packs.

@Rameyuk, @lekso: Yes, the .iso from this torrent is bootable.

@Equnax: When you activate it, the watermark at the bottom right corner will disappear.

@RMS043061: The above activation method works.

@pjanil, @topjimmy68, @demis1159, @ImSoJaded, @futopeti: You can activate Windows 8 using the guide below.

While in Desktop Mode, right click the bottom left corner. Click ""Command Prompt (Admin)"":

For Win 8 Enterprise:
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato

For Win 8 Professional:
slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato 

Key to install Media Center(after you've installed Win 8 Pro):

,PirateWarden,2012-08-07T01:10Z,"@RMS043061: There seems to be no sign of an expiration on this activation method. You can use Windows Update, but make sure to choose and install the updates yourself. Microsoft may issue an update in the near future to patch the activation."
,topjimmy68,2012-08-07T02:00Z,"@PirateWarden
Clicking ""View details in Windows Activation"" after activating the ENT version shows ""Your license to use Windows expires on 2/2/2013"" which is the same behaviour as the PRO version.

The thing about the enterprise version, at least with Windows 7, is that it is designed to periodically check in with a corporate KMS server.  If you remove a KMS-activated computer from the corporate environment, its activation will eventually expire."

And yes Windows 8 is pretty good. Those of you who are obsessed with Aero Glass taken out, just count the huge number of other graphical advancements before you go further. Start menu / Metro / other UI changes just took me 2-3 mins to figure out so it is hardly an issue.

Now I hope some reliable activation trick is available by February when the 180 days period ends as these anonymous kms servers may be taken down anytime."
