
"Patrick KeillerΓÇÖs film, perhaps best described as a visual essay, blends documentary footage of the capital with an ironic, sardonic voice-over from a fictional, disembodied narrator (Paul Schofield) who guides us through the images that he sees as he and his unseen friend Robinson tour the city in search of literary heritage and culture.

Unusually for a documentary, and almost absurdly, it seems, for a documentary about a city, KeillerΓÇÖs camera remains completely static throughout. Instead of conveying the speedy tempo of a bustling metropolis, the film instead presents us with a series of meticulously framed shots that at once mimic and subvert the picture-postcard view of our capital city. Yet there is such beauty in KeillerΓÇÖs images, which blend street signs and bomb sites with whispering park gates and leaves waving in the breeze, that one cannot help but look afresh at a city that has become defamiliarised through the soft-focus lens of Richard CurtisΓÇÖs camera..."


The film is No 39 in Time Out's 100 Best British Films.
