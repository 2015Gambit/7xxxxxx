World's Greenest Homes travels to Minnesota to a former 1940s bungalow that was
transformed into a modern architectural gem featuring flexible, fun-loving design, two types of solar panels, a green roof, and a deck made from recycled milk jugs.
Then, a home that is minutes from Hollywood and built above an open, four-car garage. This perfectly ventilated 1,500-square-foot Culver City green home features a wall of massive windows and a front door made from rice straw.
Finally, it's off to downtown Chicago to see an award-winning, 3,000 square-foot, one-of-a-kind home with an enviable, inner-city terrace.
