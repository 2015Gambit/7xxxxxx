,xgnarrx,2012-08-05T18:31Z,is this an official ISO from MS or an user/hacker made?
,ashmotif200,2012-08-05T18:35Z,slow
,topjimmy68,2012-08-05T18:39Z,Very doubtful that M$ would combine these like this - must be a custom job.
,blankm,2012-08-05T18:39Z,"As mentioned, this is made from the ISOs leaked from wzor yesterday and today. Or you can call it a Custom ISO from original MS ISOs."
,fernandobribeiro,2012-08-05T18:52Z,Activador :???
,fernandobribeiro,2012-08-05T19:00Z,Fix :??
,arj009,2012-08-05T19:01Z,"MS will never make a AIO disc for public use
its obvious made my someone"
,blankm,2012-08-05T19:11Z,"Guys n Girls, this is a CUSTOM ISO made by team devscene from the original ISOs leaked by wzor!
Hope i wont have to repeat.

,blankm,2012-08-05T20:04Z,"Look at the stats> 19 seeders vs 169 leechers!!
Please have patience."
,pjanil,2012-08-05T20:22Z,"hey DevScene pls try to create an iso for less than 4.28gb so that it fit in a dvd, thanks"
,blankm,2012-08-05T20:47Z,"@ pjanil

,sliopipr,2012-08-05T20:53Z,"No doubt this is the rtm version!

,boscoboscowitz,2012-08-05T22:30Z,"I get it loud and clear: this post is a collection of 5 genuine ISOs from MS. Question is: has any progress been made on activation for the Professional versions? It appears activation method has changed since Win 7 (several posts on TPB about this), and this is not currently solved"
,dvxini,2012-08-05T23:10Z,it has windows activator included in iso???
,Olarila,2012-08-06T02:13Z,No activator for now.....
,GradiusV,2012-08-06T02:43Z,This crap is really worth the time?
,Toxin07,2012-08-06T03:52Z,If you want a smaller iso. download a professional iso torrent from here on the site. then use the serials in the pastebin provided above and there you go an activated Windows 8 professional copy.
,blankm,2012-08-06T04:02Z,"@ GradiusV
Dont waste our time also, this ISO is meant for saving time and bandwidth as its a AIO.

Thr is no activator , no hacks. An All In One ISO with the keys leaked by wzor."
,mudslag,2012-08-06T06:48Z,for the ignorant what does AIO stand for?
,extracube,2012-08-06T06:57Z,"@Toxin07, from what I understand is that with these current RTM versions, the keys do not actually activate Windows 8, but only allow you to proceed with the install.  In other words you can install but will have to wait for a crack / loader later on to make your new Windows 8 ""valid.""  Anyone correct me if I'm wrong."
,neoxcool,2012-08-06T07:02Z,Beautiful work! by the way is it DVD5?
,demis1159,2012-08-06T07:55Z,"These codes (this for http://pastebin.com/Ps9CzfHc) definitely will work or not?
None activate crack we can find?"
,EscapeKey,2012-08-06T09:17Z,"@mudslag: It stands for ""All In One"""
,49ersfan,2012-08-06T15:41Z,will this fit on a single dvd 
,T-Minus420,2012-08-06T18:23Z,"Standard DVD = 4.37 GB.  So to answer several of your questions, NO THIS WILL NOT FIT ON A SINGLE LAYER DVD.  You will need either a dual-layer DVD (DL) or at least an 8 GB USB Flash Drive."
,RaisinCain,2012-08-06T22:46Z,A standard DVD is 4.7GB- not 4.37.
,topjimmy68,2012-08-06T23:08Z,"@demis1159
Codes will work for install, but not for activation.  Haven't seen Windows 8 activation defeated yet."

For me, activation details shows ""Your license to use Windows expires on 2/2/2013""
Plenty of time for now, if this holds up."

,Kirtan666,2012-08-09T13:47Z,"Although it says 4.54GB, after downloading, it says the file is actually 4,756,346 KM. Which means its just over 4.7GB. I really wish they made it a little under 4.7GB. I mean come on...it's only 50MB over! So it can't be burnt to a DVD. Dissapointed. Hopefully it will be compressed a little more or something!"
