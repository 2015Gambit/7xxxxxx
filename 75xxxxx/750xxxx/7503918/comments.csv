,wyattspoppa,2012-08-04T19:34Z,"Oh look, Hedede is back and now we know he's stupid on top of being a tool. Is this the same DL? Let's see, the others were 1.57 GB, thus is 4.32 GB or around TRIPLE THE GB you wingnut! The Dutch subs didn't catch your eye either huh Captain Obvious."

,Ichthus,2012-08-05T15:28Z,"If you don't want it, leave it! Just be grateful that some people bother and do their very best to upload films other people would like to have, even if it is not the best quality. 
Thanks for all the good work, NLUPPER (and other uppers too)!"
,girlie90,2012-08-10T00:15Z,"@everyone

where i do agree with wyattspoppa n hedede can stfu, cuz no one wants your opinion about who has too much money,  can we get a ballpark A/V on this instead of a bitchfest? thatd be great. I dont care if its blueray quality as long as i can see the movie n whats going on. . .  K? 
thanks"
,johnlanks76,2012-08-11T01:21Z,"i hafta agree with girlie90. I was under the assumption that the comments were supposed to be in regards to the MOVIE. apparently some people would rather bitch at one another like a bunch of little girls. thanks for all the comments that had nothing to do with the movie. very helpful, idiots."
,splidttercrist,2012-08-13T16:38Z,"So ... has someone actually downloaded this and can tell the quality? There are no screenshots, unfortunately. "
,ukfilm1,2012-08-17T01:16Z,"Thanks For sharing brother,it's a fantastic film, this will do nicely until the Dvd comes out.
Again thanks for the work on your behalf.
Cheers"
,azulmarino,2012-08-19T05:37Z,"Poor quality cam, V4/A5"
,Vasco1888,2012-09-05T01:30Z,"Soon as it came out I went to see it. Think Nolan finished a great trilogy. Thanks for the upload, ignore all the bullshit people say here. there are lot's who are thankfull! :)"
