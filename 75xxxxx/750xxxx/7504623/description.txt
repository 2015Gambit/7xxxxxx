Release: 8/1/2012


Counter-Strike 2D is a two-dimensional conversion of the popular game Counter-Strike by Valve┬«. You control your character from a top-down aerial perspective. An optional fog of war prevents that you are able to see through walls and thereby encourages tactical gameplay.

However Counter-Strike 2D has to offer much more than the well known scenarios from the original Counter-Strike! There are loads of new maps, weapons and game modes! Capture the Flag, Domination, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Construction or even a Zombie mode!
