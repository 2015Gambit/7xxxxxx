,ThxAlways,2012-08-04T07:06Z,Can't wait for the 1080p version at 10 gig...Cheers Bozx..
,zauriel80,2012-08-04T07:07Z,"44.67GB?!? Man, I'm an HD enthusiast, but that's ridiculous."
,fujimonster,2012-08-04T07:18Z,who in their right mind would download 44gb for one movie.
,pjones452,2012-08-04T07:31Z,seed please
,pjones452,2012-08-04T07:34Z,pubhd uploaded it as soon as he ripped it so relax they're working on a smaller size
[V],aoloffline,2012-08-04T07:49Z,"Obiously no one here bought a Blu Ray disc :-)  ..Big movies like this deserve the best presentation..
 Of course BOZX will uplaod the 720p/1080p encodes soon..
  THis is mostly for those with good bandwith/hardware"
,BRloloys,2012-08-04T08:09Z,awts...what the heck 44gb for 1 movie r u kidding....no one download this...
,berto420,2012-08-04T08:10Z,"WOw holy size batman, only for hardcores. Thx 4 uploading."
,realkatt,2012-08-04T08:11Z,Thanks Up loader i love the untouched bluray s hope u post more. keep up the goods job
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-04T08:37Z,"Come on man, 1080p at 5-6 gigs please."
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-04T08:38Z,Can this be played on  VLC Media Player and HDMI output to my tv?
,.Leto.,2012-08-04T09:04Z,"Jeez, so many stupid comments... If it's too big for you don't download it, simply wait for a smaller release. There's really no need to complain about it. This is the equivalent of the original BR, minus the useless bonuses that, at best, you will watch once in your life. And it's free!"
,hsinghg,2012-08-04T09:08Z,"@3PeatWillCome: yep sure but not if your computer is somewhat old, for eg, core 2 types with no dedicated graphics card(the video will stutter and choke in that case)."
,ccCowboy,2012-08-04T09:11Z,Thank you.  This is the full disk untouched.  If you don't want it don't download.  Lots of us now have our pc intergrated into home theater systems with hd audio and big screens.  This is perfect for that.  If you are watching on a small monitor download the small version.
,Jonasx,2012-08-04T09:30Z,I really hope there's a smaller 1080p version that still includes 7.1 audio. 
,ccCowboy,2012-08-04T10:17Z,7.1 HD audio is 4-6gigs just for audio so it is not included in smaller releases
,OmegaHax,2012-08-04T11:56Z,wtf 44 GB go fuck yourself
,Goldfire1986,2012-08-04T11:58Z,"I laugh at the people complaining about the size. This is not the first I've downloaded at this sort of size, ~44GB is nothing."
,lorddeep,2012-08-04T13:03Z,"Thank you for the upload, need more seeds though speed is unberable, couple of kb at best all day. Im sure its worth it, cant think of a better movie made for years..."
,nomad1980,2012-08-04T13:15Z,Thanks for the upload! 
,Nochobdia,2012-08-04T13:36Z,"Hahaha!
OmegaHax, you're the best, hahaha.
This moronic, 44,67GB release is only for haughty kids! Enjoy kiddos!"
,SilenceMurderer,2012-08-04T13:44Z,"Thanks! 

There should be more Blu-Ray releases and they should have their own category."
,Nochobdia,2012-08-04T13:50Z,"You can all fuck yourselfs with this moronic 44,67 GB shit!"
,benjs,2012-08-04T14:31Z,I'm with Goldfire - happy to see a high bitrate version here with a full DTS-HD MA 7.1 track. Thanks for the upload!
,Cubical,2012-08-04T14:53Z,"Jesus Christ so many idiots around. This is the FULL Blu-ray disc, not an MKV. Of course some people will want this. Grow a brain."
,ccCowboy,2012-08-04T15:06Z,Why bother commenting on a Torrent you are not going to download.  Just move on.
,bombadill,2012-08-04T16:03Z,THX!! Love those big ISO files :)
,bombadill,2012-08-04T16:06Z,Thank you! Love those big ISO files. :)
,erigon95,2012-08-04T16:11Z,"Bozx I'm still wating for a 1080p version of The Hunger Games that has 1920x800 Resolution and its somewhere around 10 Gb because I cant download the 44 Gb version its just to much for my crappy internet and I'd have to wait for weeks to get it!
So please if you can upload it! :)
And btw thanks a lot for your great work! 
You are AWESOME."
,D_A7,2012-08-04T16:23Z,"hu 44gb :)

if only someone would seed this . im getting 50kb/s download and 170kb/s upload ."
,dabird4205,2012-08-04T18:19Z,OMG! OMG! 44.67GB RULES!! LOVE IT!! YES!!!!! KEEP EM COMIN Y'ALL! ENJOY!
,marcusk95,2012-08-04T18:42Z,"Why complain at the size? Just download something else. I love uploads of this size, it only takes 1 hour to download on my 100Mbit/s fiber connection, so why not get it and maybe get better quality?"
,mmaker,2012-08-04T21:02Z,"ye marcus, maybe you should stop being a dick and share instead of talking bullshit.. 1 % downloaded, 10 hours online.. no sources online.. why do people release and then go off.. waste of time"
,marcusk95,2012-08-04T22:00Z,@mmaker I have a 1-5 download/upload ratio.
,el-grey,2012-08-04T22:14Z,"BOZX upload the spanish latin audio 640 kbps, please!!!"
,usamah23,2012-08-05T00:28Z,thank's for uploading it's realy a blueray disc idownload it even it's so so so so big size
,mutz-nutz,2012-08-05T01:08Z,"@ccCowboy WELL SAID!!

Thanks BOZX, look forward for this to finish."
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-05T08:22Z,"How would one play this off a computer? What programs are needed and how do you do it? Will VLC Media Player work?

I already saw the movie but I want this torrent because it's the only one in Spanish."
,electrond,2012-08-05T10:50Z,Fucking proper Quality - Finally!! You rule BOZX! Subtitles and all ;-) Just got to love you. My best regards
,ccCowboy,2012-08-05T18:12Z,"@3peatwillcome
This is an exact copy the Blu ray disc and can be burned onto a BR disc and played on a stand alone player.   On the pc side only Power dvd and maybe Total Media will play folder structure.  Try playing the largerst .mts file in the stream folder (24gigs) this may or may not be the whole movie.  After I have watched all the extras I want I usually convert the main movie to one mkv with only the languages I want that will play in most software.  There are numerous ways and guides on how to do this just search convert blu to mkv.  Hope this helps."
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-05T22:43Z,"Seeeeed people, come on.

or just rip a 1080p spanish please."
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-06T03:27Z,"Fucking hell, only 500-700 kB/s where the hell are the seeders."
,Naruto_TB,2012-08-06T09:50Z,"I download 40gb+ files all the time. If you have a Ps3 and any information on the PS3 scene then you will know what i mean. With that being said, 1 movie does not always compare to 1 game(in some ppls mind) in terms of replay value. I appreciate the time he took to upload this, if you dont agree with the size then go dl the 700mb version and get on with your life."
,ccCowboy,2012-08-06T11:05Z,"VERY IMPORTANT!!!

I have finished now and even when playing on power dvd there are some repeat scenes and length is slightly different than officail reports.  There is a problem with the original disc this came from.  There are multiple MPL that all are incorrect (checked in EAC 3 GUI and DVD fab) the same scenes repeats out of sequence depending on which MPL is used.  After lots of work I think I have the proper squence for the .mts files.  Processing now and will report back as soon as I have verified."
,ccCowboy,2012-08-06T11:26Z,Just to clarify.  In the MPL that powr dvd uses as default the scene only repeatsonce or twice and at first thought it was a flash back adds only about 1min in length.  The torrent is good just the original disc had problems.  Still a great torrent and you could easily watch and not notice.  But for those that wish to create there own MKV from this file I will post the right seqence for files.
,ccCowboy,2012-08-06T13:48Z,"Bozx was kind enough to help me out.  The proper MPLS to use is 76  some how I missed it and power dvd does not choose the right one either.  For those of you doing manually the right squence of .mts files is ....

4,509,504,501,512,511,00001,505,508,503,510,502"
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-06T19:24Z,"I am getting a Copyright message when I try to play the movie, about 7 minutes in it gives me the message and it won't continue from there."
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-06T19:31Z,"I got the message in TotalMedia Theater 5, it seems like VLC media player doesn't give that message.

Another question, at what time does the scene repeat?"
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-06T19:48Z,"Fucking hell, 2 days to download and it has the repeated scenes.

Is there anyway to fix this by moving or renaming the files?"
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-06T21:01Z,"ccowboy,

How can I fix the repeated scene. I want the spanish audio. Do I convert it to a MKV? How do I do that?"
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-06T22:15Z,"Nevermind, I got it working. 

I used DVDFab 8 to create an MKV, I used Title 76 and chose the Spanish audio, then converted it. Viola!

Full 1920x1080p in Spanish with no repeated scenes."
,bubears11,2012-08-07T00:41Z,"This may be a dumb question, but I'm stumped. The video file shows up on my mac as an avchd file, and I can't seem to figure out how to convert it to mkv. I tried using Toast but all the files were jumbled up and a couple mts files couldnt be read by Toast. Any help is greatly appreciated!"
,mmaker,2012-08-08T11:21Z,can anyone say how you make working blue ray image from this? Tried with imgburn but power dvd wouldnt read it.
,mmaker,2012-08-08T20:37Z,"nvm, working perfectly now, just imgburn and mount with dt as scsi = gg."
,pohgdfnfd,2012-08-13T15:55Z,"Is this really 1920x1080 or 1920x800? Will it fill my whole screen or have bars on the top, cuz all other bluray rips of this movie are 1920x800"
,ndrwzheng,2012-08-23T16:54Z,Could someone please give detailed instructions on how to play this movie? Also what are repeating scenes?
