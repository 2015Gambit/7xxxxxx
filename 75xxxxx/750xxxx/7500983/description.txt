HONEST INJUN is a 1970 release by bluesy Irish country-rock band Granny's Intention, featuring Gary Moore on guitar and including "We Both Need To Know."

Both a period piece and a collectors' item, the release of ΓÇ£Honest InjunΓÇ¥ by Granny's Intentions will no doubt be of immense interest to Gary Moore/Thin Lizzy fans. For such a well-chronicled musician, little information is available on Granny's Intentions, with whom Gary made his recording debut at the tender age of 17. Most biographies of Moore leap from his juncture in Skid Row with Phil Lynott in the late 60s directly to his joining Thin Lizzy in 1974, neglecting to mention Granny's Intentions. For close on 30 years copies of ΓÇ£Honest InjunΓÇ¥ have been highly sought after, but its historical and musical context has been lost. Although the band hailed from Limerick, they were living in Dublin when Moore first met them.
