this bitch TFK is as bad as toejam116 or toemak or whatever the name. just another user uploading other's files as their own release.  -   people boycott. even though this one MAY be clean this is how most malware gets spread. dumbasses uploading shit they find on eastern european or asia crap sites without testing and claiming it's a ""scene"" release."

i was gonna help out with the 1.7 patch but O.o look at that guys he uploaded the patch too =O lol...

But, it works 100% tested 1.7.7, crashes on 1.6. if your using any mods i would suggest upgrading skse so it's compatible with the new 1.7 patch.

Again i think i should speak for every one, thank you very much for putting in the time to be so helpful to all of us (Even the whiny little brats =x ). Borat: HIGH FIVE!"

- apply patch
- copy the dawnguard DLC files into your installation folder / data
- now, go to documents/my games/skyrim/skyrim prefs and add the following to the BEGINNING / TOP of the file.

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0

Right sucking up out of the way, to everyone that owns Skyrim and wants the DLC, This mode definitely works, with all mods and the latest version off SKSE. Also guys the instructions are simple, you need the latest patch which T.F.K has kindly uploaded and given you instructions. You will need the previous updates. This link will give you the updates I have used. 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7363212/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.v1.6.89.0.6.Update.9.CRACKED-P2P

Umm to those who are having problems with Dawnguard not showing up on your data files, I advise you to try run the game in any case. If the game does run then I do not know what to do, if it doesn't try again, I had to do it twice before I could activate the DLC pack

Once again I thank T.F.K for uploading this outstanding Crack."
,Rushy787,2012-08-05T21:28Z,"Sorry I was being very clear. If the game does run without it loading any of your previous mods and updates, then i do not know what to do.

and after you install that, install 1.7 at: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7501566/The_Elder_Scrolls_V__Skyrim_1.7_patch_by_T.F.K
and then you can install the dawnguard expansion into the data folder. After all of that open your skyrim launcher and if data files is grayed out go to C:/documents/mygames/skyrim or until you get to skyrim prefs. Open it and cntrl F then type ""launcher"" then click to the right of the highlighted blue and click enter and paste in: bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=4
bEnableFileSelection=1
if there is another one of these lines with a different number just delete and then cntrl S to save.

,OmegaV,2012-08-25T02:00Z,"I copied and pasted what jerrypix instructed but will add some stuff that he/she forgot to include for dummies. YOU MUST CHANGE A SETTING IN ""SkyrimPrefs"" TO PLAY DAWNGUARD.  THERE ARE TWO, 2, OF THIS FILE.  ONE IS LOCATED IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER, LOOK FOR -LAUNCHER- ADD WHAT jerrypix TOLD YOU, THEN IF YOU HAVE A SECOND, 2nd, DRIVE FIND THIS IN THERE AS WELL, CHANGE IT TI THE SAME THING!  THIS WORKED FOR ME. ~~~  YOU MUST CHANGE IT IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER ~~~""alright guys, so to get this to work you need the 1.6 patch at: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7363212/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.v1.6.89.0.6.Update.9.CRACKED-P2P
and after you install that, install 1.7 at: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7501566/The_Elder_Scrolls_V__Skyrim_1.7_patch_by_T.F.K
and then you can install the dawnguard expansion into the data folder. After all of that open your skyrim launcher and if data files is grayed out go to C:/documents/mygames/skyrim or until you get to skyrim prefs. Open it and cntrl F then type ""launcher"" then click to the right of the highlighted blue and click enter and paste in: bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=4
bEnableFileSelection=1
if there is another one of these lines with a different number just delete and then cntrl S to save.
Congratulations, click play and enjoy! "

,alvaroaaa,2012-09-06T03:08Z,"Guys, in case you don't know, you have to be at least lvl 10 for the guards around skyrim start talking about Dawnguard. Once you reach lvl 10 though, probably a member of the dawnguard will seek you and give you the quest (at least that's how it's supposed to work)."
,Prrange12,2012-09-09T07:01Z,"i have figured out how to fix the combat. 

you have to install the 1.6 patch and run it with the 1.7 TESV.exe 

ENJOY. "

,Swedz,2012-09-16T21:07Z,"I GOT A PROBLEM!!
I got the mods to work (Dawnguard and the core mod). I started up my main menu and then I pressed Continue. But at the loading screen, everything was shaking. And when I got In-Game I was running REALLY fast as well as I swinged my blades really fast. This is really annoying. Also the whole world is a bit changed. What did I do wrong? "
