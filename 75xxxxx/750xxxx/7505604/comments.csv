,flashfv,2012-08-05T10:45Z,I could have include more games with this but I didn't want the file size to be over a GB so I kept my favorites! Request a game if it wasn't included because I probably have it.

,flashfv,2012-08-07T03:27Z,@faren73 try going to this website for games http://coolrom.com I was going to upload requests but I found this website and its way easier for you to go there and download than for me to upload it.
