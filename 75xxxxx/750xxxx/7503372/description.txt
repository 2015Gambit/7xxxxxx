Working with African percussion groups I know the Dutch Treat Africa compilations are simply the best available on the net. However. Dutch Treat stopped per the first of August and although the series was quite popular, I was the only seeder left. So people were disappointed because downloading was hard (I share 250 uploads with a 1 MB connection).
 
For them I will put all the playlists in one library and share it with a friend for a month. After that its really done. So if you do not want to share, go away!
This upload is for African music lovers who are willing to share.
 
Enjoy
