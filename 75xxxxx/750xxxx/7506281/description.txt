YouΓÇÖre not going to believe this, but Seattle had music before Nirvana! And not just Jimi Hendrix or Sir Mix-A-Lot, either. The Emerald City was home to a thriving soul scene in the ΓÇÖ60s and ΓÇÖ70s, and this documentary digs up exquisite odds and ends from a rich musical past largely eclipsed and forgotten by the booming ΓÇÖ90s. It was Seattle DJ Mr. Supreme who stumbled on local soul and funk masterpieces in Goodwills and record shops, only to find that many of the once-celebrated artists heΓÇÖd discoveredΓÇöplayers from funky, outrageous acts like Black On White Affair, CookinΓÇÖ Bag, and Cold, Bold TogetherΓÇöwere living in obscurity around him. ItΓÇÖs the incredibly funky tracks from those bands that make up the, ahem, soul of WheedleΓÇÖs Groove. Between archival audio and exhaustive interviews, the film plays out kind of like a Pacific Northwest version of Wim WendersΓÇÖ Buena Vista Social Club. The documentary isnΓÇÖt just an eye-opener for regional musicheads or vindication for these bands, who almost unilaterally disbanded when disco DJs took over the clubs and airwaves; itΓÇÖs also more proof that one doesnΓÇÖt have to work for Smithsonian Folkways to uncover important pieces of music history. Pop giveth and pop taketh away, but these artists are finally gaining national exposure three or four decades after their heyday
