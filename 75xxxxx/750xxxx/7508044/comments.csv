,donkeydub,2012-09-04T20:24Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but I'm having an issue with it. I'm downloading into Miro, but it isn't moving into my library when it's finished, and when I click on ""Reveal in Explorer"", it says that the file was deleted outside of Miro...any info would be great, thanks."
