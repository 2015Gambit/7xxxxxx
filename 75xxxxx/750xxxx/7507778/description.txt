Like most people who are into wifi hacking then you are familiar with a tool called driftnet. This tool when combined with arpspoof will allow you to see most images being viewed by other members on the same network!

This is a neat tool for spying on other people and seeing what images they are viewing! 

NOTE: REQUIRES ROOT!

FYI this will slightly bog down the network. Unfortunately it spoofs the whole network and not just one target you specify.
