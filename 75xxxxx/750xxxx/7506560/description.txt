As part of PacktΓÇÖs BeginnerΓÇÖs Guide series, this book will walk the reader through straightforward examples that show the creation of an e-commerce site built on Drupal. This book is for people who have some experience building websites and who want to learn to do so with Drupal 7. You should have experience with HTML markup, CSS, and jQuery. Experience with previous versions of Drupal would be helpful, but is not necessary.
