I have noticed some requests so here its one of them.
If you liked Sound Express and Bib Set you most like this. These two guys is the ancestors for all jazz, organ, drum, music that later will become a little bit of a swedish speciality. Who were they then? Janne Carlsson was the drummer that later becomed a famous actor here in Sweden. Bo Hansson that played organ is one of the famoused musicans ever from Sweden. His album "Sagan om ringen" or "Lord of the rings" from 1970 is one of the best selling albums ever from Sweden. And his other albums is also the best ever when it comes to organ music. But back to H&K, their way to play started the progressive era in Sweden. Cause it didnt sound like anything that have been recorded before. It wasen't jazz it wasent rock and not beat it was NEW. The funny is that they were bigger abroad then here in Sweden. Becuse when Jimi Hendrix toured in Sweden they were opening band ant the legend says that he liked there song "Tax Free" so much that he bought the rights for the song. Well in 1969 they disbanded and Bo did his famous solo albums and Janne did more and more acting.
