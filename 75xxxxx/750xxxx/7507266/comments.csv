Follow your instruction, it seems it doesn't work.

If I copy crackeado1 & crackeado2 into app directory, then how many digit to put on the serial number? After input serial number, then I press ok. Is it right? 

After that, I open crackeado2, but it is no response. Please help to explain in details.

Thank you so much"

after doing all that open crackeado2 it shouldn't show anything like a window when opened, just the icon next to the clock, from that icon you can configure program options...

if all that happen, then you can delete original airparrot.exe and crackeado1.exe, and rename crackeado2.exe to airparrot.exe

obviously when you want to open the app, open crackeado2 or if you have renamed it then it would be airparrot"
