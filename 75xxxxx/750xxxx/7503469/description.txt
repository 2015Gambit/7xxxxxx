PLEASE NOTE
Face detection may not work as well in either very dark environments or in environments with a bright light source in the background. In such cases it helps to adjust the lighting conditions or the camera position slightly. High res images (~ΓÇï 4000 x 2500px and up) deliver the best viewing experience. Furthermore, you are able to "invert" the controls of the view in the preferences.

Enjoy!
