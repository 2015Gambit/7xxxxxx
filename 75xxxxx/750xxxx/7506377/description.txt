As befits a game endorsed by Cristiano Ronaldo - a player who embodies the skill and grace of top level football - PES 2013 sees the series returning to its roots, with the emphasis on the individual skills of the world's best players, and giving the player the total freedom to play any style of ball, which includes for the first time full control over shots.. This follows further consultation with both football and PES fans alike, and the result is the most faithful recreation of modern day football to date, with players modeled to match the running motions, abilities and playing styles, and the flicks and turns of their real-life counterparts.

Three key elements form the basis of PES 2013's innovations, with all new additions falling within the fields of PES FullControl, Player ID, and ProActive AI.
