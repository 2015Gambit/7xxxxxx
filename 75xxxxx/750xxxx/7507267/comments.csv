after installation, open crackeado2 but no response on computer even I can have mirroring icon on phone. Please help.

Thank you very much"

after installation copy crackeado1 and crackeado2 to app dir, open crackeado1 put anything you want for serial and hit ok, it should show ""register succesful"" or something like that :P then close it from the little icon that is next to the clock....

after doing all that open crackeado2 it shouldn't show anything like a window when opened, just the icon next to the clock, from that icon you can configure program options...

if all that happen, then you can delete original reflection.exe and crackeado1.exe, and rename crackeado2.exe to reflection.exe

obviously when you want to open the app, open crackeado2 or if you have renamed it then it would be reflection"
