*!!!!Make sure to put these in your overrides folder!!!!*
Do the following:
1) Go to ""Documents"" folder,
2) Then, ""Electronic Arts"" folder,
3) Then, ""The Sims 3"" folder,
4) Then, ""Mods"" folder
5) Then, ""Overridess"" folder (if you don't have it, CREATE it and COPY inside all your .package files from FIX folder)
6) After that, reboot the game and here you go. No bugs."
,Green.Banana,2012-08-08T02:56Z,"I think I'd feel a bit more confident in this torrent if you could kindly explain what each ""FIX"" is for.  I don't even know to which bugs you are referring to.  For instance, does ""UnAwesome"" only apply to users of the ""Awesome Mod""?  Apart from the fact I found that unfindable even with the links people routinely spam for it, I also found some of its modifications to be tasteless, so I abstained from its use.  Therefore some people may not need to use this fix, or may even need to abstain from using it lest it inadvertently break something else.  May we please have a little more documentation?  "
