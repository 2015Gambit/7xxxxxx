*ePSXe 1.7 Emulator and it comes with the bios and plugins so 
 you are set and ready to start playing PlayStation games!
*This is the pc version of EpSXe so i doesn't work in linux
 but you could get a linux version if searched for it but
 it would not be precofigured like this one. It is a pain in 
 the ass to configure from scratch!
*Extract with WinRAR
