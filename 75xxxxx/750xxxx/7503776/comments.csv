,skyvillage,2012-08-04T20:57Z,Big money studio movies like this are almost always HIGHLY over-rated.  This one too.
,marcusk95,2012-08-04T22:11Z,"Quality is great, similar to most 1080P rips of this size. Audio good to. Only thing missing is i can't find any subtitles for this release."
,dududus,2012-08-04T22:21Z,"Original BLOW release has 30sec repeated scenes every 10 mins.

There is now a BLOW rerip.

Will this movie BLOW my mind?"
,.Leto.,2012-08-05T03:18Z,"So I just finished watching this movie, quality is perfect. Only problem, this movie sucked. It takes 1 hour to start, then it's just some action you've already seen a thousand times. There's really nothing special about this movie, no idea why it made so many $$.
Anyway, excellent rip quality."

from what I understand the movie is quite disappointing compared to the books."

anyway, now I know that you'd better read the books if you want to appreciate the movie."
,3PeatWillCome,2012-08-05T08:15Z,"Good quality rip, doesn't have the repeated scenes like the other ones.

Movie was pretty good."
