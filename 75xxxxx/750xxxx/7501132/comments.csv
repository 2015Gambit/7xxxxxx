,panamalynn,2012-08-03T22:18Z,Thank you so much.  You are the only one anywhere that is uploading this.  I appreciate that so much.  To all the rest out there please have consideration and seed back.  It shows me that it is going to take 1 week to download this.  This seems to be an ongoing problem and I try to seed as long as I can.  I live in Central America so I have no choice but to pirate.  Thank you for your consideration.
