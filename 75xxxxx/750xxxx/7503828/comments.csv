,spifkitten99,2012-08-08T22:41Z,"Quite poor quality.

600 megs is simply way too little for a 720 video of this length."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-08-08T23:28Z,"Not another 50 Cent movie , He can't act ."
,vampzcore,2012-08-09T00:08Z,thanks!!

,ironymon,2012-08-10T13:17Z,"50 cent acts better than you and me put together, so why the fuck you care? If it's not about that, his image brings more viewers, and i'm gonna watch it only for that."
,vikingman11,2012-08-10T18:49Z,A10/V10. Brilliant quality in a small file too! Excellent job
,spifkitten99,2012-08-10T19:29Z,"You are a retard, or you have very bad eyes, if you rate the video quality 10."
,ipodmonesta,2012-08-13T21:05Z,"people stop nagging! the movie is great and the quality is awesome!

[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-08-13T22:55Z,"I was wrong , I take it all back  , 50 cent was actually very good in this . "
,resmith,2012-08-23T09:27Z,A V 10. If your not happy with this upload then go & waste your bandwidth & download the 4.5 gb ones you big ungrateful babies. Quality & movie both great. Thanks YIFY.
,resmith,2012-08-24T05:12Z,Subtitles only necessary if you don't understand Chimpanzee or hearing impaired.

Thanks YIFY. Thanks for the subtitles fofo141.

@ resmith
Subtitles are also necessary if you can't stand the sound of Tim Allen's voice."
,Rezzo76,2012-09-07T15:18Z,"@spifkitten99  If you think the quality is quite poor, you need to have your eyes and ears checked. 

A/V = 9 at the very least"
,Rezzo76,2012-09-07T15:24Z,"I have 20/30 vision acuity, and im watching this on a 64 inch screen. the video quality is fine, youre blind as a bat if you think this is poor video quality, or youre watching this on a TV that still has knobs. do you have color TV spifkitty99?"
,Rezzo76,2012-09-07T15:45Z,"spifkitten99 must be watching this on a console TV with knobs and rabbit ears, possibly black and white. I have 20/30 vision in both eyes, and the video quality is great. And i speak fluent Chimpanzee, so no need for subtitles. 

A:9.5
V:9.5 at least
M:10

good job YIFY, great upload."
,CryOzed,2012-09-11T07:32Z,"Thanks!
10 for A/M, and thanks ""fofo141"" for the sub."
