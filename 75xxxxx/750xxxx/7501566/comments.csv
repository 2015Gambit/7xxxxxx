,SelfPotato,2012-08-04T00:12Z,there`s only 1 exe?
,PineappleStarz,2012-08-04T00:27Z,"because all the previous files are the same.
this is common with many of the updates, its only the exe which contains the beef.

thanks TFK for taking the time and checking this.

now we have put up with all the retards asking whether they have to install all the previous patches first.. again..lol"
,fuminpurple,2012-08-04T00:42Z,Works like a charm!!! Thank you!!
,T.F.K,2012-08-04T00:42Z,"Yes,Install or paste TESV file into your game dir,or
paste TESV file into your game dir then install :)"
,shauwy,2012-08-04T00:57Z,"ok thanks ;)
I put your 2 file in data on skyrim
put the TESV file in game dir
Actived dawngardes .esm with the launcher
But how to launch this add on ^^"
,hexiarrr,2012-08-04T00:57Z,i tried deleting my ini files but skyrim still just locks up it doesnt crash it just hangs
,griffin_nailo,2012-08-04T01:16Z,"Can't seem to get it to work, copy and pasted replaced the TESV file and now when I run it it says invalid patch"
,griffin_nailo,2012-08-04T01:22Z,"I thought it was due to my skse being outdated so I updated that as well. Still no luck, hope someone knows a fix for this I would really like to check out dawnguard."
,hisazul,2012-08-04T02:02Z,"not to be a duch or anything seems uploader got enough working torrents to be beliable at least.
but which fucking patch does it go over.... some random skidrow patch or reloaded or what...?
does this work over 9th reloaded path?"
,griffin_nailo,2012-08-04T02:26Z,It overites update 9.. but I'm still having trouble getting it to work right...
,simongous,2012-08-04T03:34Z,Hey TFK why havent you killed yourself yet? Can you please go do so now?
,MuStiileb34,2012-08-04T04:18Z,"the TESV file worked, does that mean its patched? sorry im still new to this stuff :3"
,chill_718,2012-08-04T06:02Z,"Your the fucking man bro. Been trying every patch 2,5,6,37 times never worked. Not only did yours work in the first try it lets me use all my mods too!!!"
,Gfunk839,2012-08-04T08:53Z,So just this exe is the entire update?? Thanks
,Hogwarts,2012-08-04T10:14Z,"I can confirm that the patch is working.

I can't confirm it's the real update tho.

The reason being because it didn't seem to change anything in the game at all.

The only difference I noticed was the version number went up some.

So someone could have reg edited the version number to a higher value and saved it. "
,T.F.K,2012-08-04T11:39Z,"Here is full Dawnguard,with latest patch,update :

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7502951/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Dawnguard_amp_ndash_FULL_CRACKED_amp_ndash_DL"
,dukeofarliss,2012-08-04T11:45Z,"Hey simongous, fuck off, don't be an ass, it's not like you can crack these files yourself.
I have the reloaded version, copied the one .exe into the skyrim install dir and it worked fine, skse and all my mods are fine.
If you can't get it to work just use update-9 from reloaded, dawnguard works with that too."
,Dread_Naught96,2012-08-04T13:39Z,"Is this compatible with the Razor 1911 crack?

Because the TESV file doesnt seem to work.

It launches skyrim and then the screen just turns black and it eventually crashes."
,barr91,2012-08-04T17:49Z,"Works great, and is recognized by SKSE for those who like to play with mods. I was having no luck with the others."
,the-psykox95,2012-08-04T18:59Z,For some reason in game the mounted horse combat isnt working and i cant attack on foot either Can i get some helpplz?
,lolk_,2012-08-04T22:47Z,"I'm having the same problem as the-psykox95, I can't attack anything as usual, magic does not work, and sheathing/changing weapons just has odd effects that should not happen.

As well as with the dawnguard patch, it actually works, I got the quest, but I can't do anything like mounted combat, etc. 

Any suggestions?"
,maebe,2012-08-04T23:52Z,I'm also having an attack issue like last comment. From what I've seen on google it's an issue with the game and not pirate.
,Kickaris,2012-08-05T02:58Z,"I'm having the exact same issue as Dread_Naught96, anyone think they can help us?"
,Ravirne1,2012-08-05T03:38Z,What is the skyrim dir? where do i put the file. b/c i cant see dir anywhere. do i put it in the Data file or just into skyrim?
,Cairnz,2012-08-05T05:08Z,I'm having the same problem as Kickaris and Dread_Naught96. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
,Rushy787,2012-08-05T11:47Z,"Guys no offense to anyone here, but this patch works perfectly, SKSE has noticed a change in the game which means that this is a working patch, also I am us ""The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.v1.6.89.0.6.Update.9.CRACKED-P2P"" patch which works great. However I also have not put in Dawnguard, but otherwise this patch is working perfectly. I will download the latest SKSE to check if that is compatible then I will make sure to post again"
,Rushy787,2012-08-05T12:05Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7363212/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.v1.6.89.0.6.Update.9.CRACKED-P2P

The Update I'm using for my Skyrim"
,masquemea,2012-08-05T12:30Z,"Doesn't work. Have same issue as Cairnz,  Kickaris and Dread_Naught96.How can I roll it back? Thanks."
,ezkapaid,2012-08-05T22:22Z,"fixed my reloaded update 9 after dawnguard made it freeze every time the world opened. genuine 1.7 it seems, added new options to the data files menu ('skyrim workshop' shortcut, mod load order) if you haven't read yet the solution for the greyed out 'data files' in the launcher, it is simple and listed below. "
,ezkapaid,2012-08-05T22:31Z,"or maybe not: to enable the data files option, go into documentsmy gamesskyrimSkyrimPrefs. Scroll down to [Launcher]. Add this third line there, so it looks like this: 
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=4
bEnableFileSelection=1

save and open the skyrim launcher. data files should be there now. open and select your mods.  incidentally using this fix finally allowed me to use the reloaded high res pack; i had no idea I needed to enable it in this menu. duh"
,pl0uk0s,2012-08-06T17:59Z,"To Kickaris, Dread_naught96, Cairnz and masquemea:
Install patch 1.6 and then copy and paste this exe for patch 1.7!!!!Had the same problem!!"
,oshnakesh,2012-08-08T02:59Z,"To everyone having the ""can't attack"" problem:
DO NOT copy any of the .bsa or .esm files from the main folder.  If you have copied those over, make sure they're deleted from your main Skyrim folder, and overwrite the ones in your Data folder with the files in this torrent's Data folder. After that, everything works fine."
,.Unique.,2012-08-08T03:23Z,not working!!!
,batman79,2012-08-10T07:44Z,"What the fuck is this uploading to 62.128.100.31:443? I launch this, and it begins uploading roughly 1MB worth of data to this IP. My 1.6 exe does NOT do this.

,oldbreadbutt,2012-08-23T10:32Z,"seems to work for me, but I haven't figured out how to tell if it's 1.7 yet. I already have mounted combat, so that's not gonna prove anything.

for what it's worth, I'm running the rzr-skrm.iso version of skyrim that TFK uploaded, with the ""The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.v1.6.89.0.6.Update.9.CRACKED-P2P"" 1.6 patch.

for anyone who's worried about this (and anyone installing pirated software SHOULD be cautious), do what I did, make a backup copy of your original TESV.exe before replacing it with this one. that should go without saying, but you never know.

if this doesn't work for you, just remove the new TESV and put the original back."
,apdj94,2012-08-25T06:38Z,is it just the TESV? That's all I need?
