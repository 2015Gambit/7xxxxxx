I give you 9 E-Books from a mystery writer extraordinaire Martin Cruz Smith. His first mystery, Canto for a Gypsy (1973) ΓÇö featuring Roman Grey, a gypsy art dealer in New York City, New York ΓÇö was nominated for an Edgar Award. Nightwing (1977), also an Edgar nominee, was his breakthrough novel, and he adapted it for a feature film of the same name (1979).

However, he is best known for the 7 Arkady Renko novels uploaded in this torrent. Gorky Park (1981), the first of the series was called the "thriller of the '80s". I have loved all of his books. I hope you will also like him.
