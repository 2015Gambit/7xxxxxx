,proteus.23,2012-08-16T19:03Z,"Argh, I didn't know there were probs w/ {C_P}'s episodes. 

Demonoid's gone -- so where can I find better versions, then?  Anyone share any links?"
,faaaaq,2012-08-17T03:38Z,"yepp, all of the C_P Deadman episodes are like that.  Demonoid dropped before i could get 9, 10, or 11, and now 12, so i havent gotten to finish the series yet :(.  you can find good (ie not cropped, but not HD) copies streaming in various places though"
