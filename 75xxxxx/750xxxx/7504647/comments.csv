That applies to you and your comment here.

If you had bothered to check the link he posted, you would have seen they were direct download links from the service MS Provides for exactly that purpose, directly from digital river content.

The downloads are, in fact, legal, but your use of them may not be, that is a given.

So next time, investigate before making an ass of yourself.
