,nileshtambe,2012-08-05T13:20Z,"@cyberdoc999 
try this solution ms given for rp can work on rtm if u have full rtm iso or internet 

If installing the .NET Framework 3.5 on demand or enabling it in Control Panel fails, you may get error message 0x800f0906: âWindows couldn't connect to the Internet to download necessary files. Make sure that you're connected to the Internet, and click Retry to try again.â This message may be displayed for the following reasons:


    Your computer is not connected to the Internet. Please connect, and then retry the operation.
    If you are unable to connect your computer to the Internet, you can enable the .NET Framework 3.5 by using the installation media (ISO image or DVD) you installed Windows 8 Release Preview from. Mount the Windows 8 Release Preview installation media and type the following command from an elevated command prompt:
    Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3 /All /Source:x:sourcessxs /LimitAccess
    where x: is the drive letter for the Windows 8 Release Preview ISO image or DVD.

    Your administrator has configured your computer to use Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) instead of Windows Update for servicing. Please ask your administrator to enable the policy to use Windows Update instead of WSUS."

regarding this rtm i hardly removed anything that ppl want to keep, that .net 3.5 is now big joke"
,iamshahbaz,2012-08-07T11:02Z,"@nilesh
seems to be a weird stuff as due to 3.5 stuff it creates a lot of issues with softwares ,I dont understand wtf they tested while releasing even online installation, offline installation ,command line nothing works.
seems to be that need to go back to windows 7 for the time being until unless there a fix though i like the smoothness and overall performance but still many bugs still there which are minor.  "
,JaaniRox,2012-08-07T14:10Z,"@Hi nilesh

,ruchirrathore,2012-08-31T19:56Z,"Hi Nilesh, I have just installed this build, with all the same drivers which I used with standard iso installation as well. Now, I am facing some issues which I didn't face with standard iso installation. 

1. Windows can't read .gadget files. I'd like to install   some useful Windows gadgets. Add remove windows features does not have Windows Gadgets Platform in the list. How to enable it?
2. Can't seem to change the screen brightness thru' power options, Windows Mobility Center, or desktop settings tile. The sidebar tile of brightness is disabled. How to fix it?
3. Windows is not able to activate. I am getting the following error : 0x8007007B : ""the filename, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect."" How to activate it? what will happen if I don't activate it in given 10 days period?

I like your work, but if windows remains unactivated then probably I will be forced to go back to standard iso installation.

Please find a solution to these problems and let me know...."
