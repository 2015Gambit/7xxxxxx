SYNOPSIS:

Riku and Tunna got into backpacking in the 90ΓÇÖs and traveled extensively for years with a very small budget and a very great curiosity. Back in 2002 they started filming in the developing countries on the grassroots level and their first TV-series grew organically out of those days.

The show became a runaway hit and garnered a cult following in Finland with itΓÇÖs two seasons that covered such varied destinations as Nepal, Indonesia, Japan, Tonga, Malawi, Tibet and Ecuador among others.

Riku Rantala became a fan favorite among the audiences fed up with fake, banal and predictable television with his harsh, take-no-prisoners attitude towards TV reporting.

Tunna Milonoff is the director and the cinematographer of Madventures, whose twisted imagination and curiosity towards everything bizarre that is usually to blame for the often-unorthodox storylines.
