Let Me Up (I've Had Enough) (styled on the cover as "Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)" with quotation marks) is an album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released in 1987. This album features more songwriting collaborations between Petty and Mike Campbell than any other Petty album. It is notable for being the only studio album not represented on Petty's 1993 Greatest Hits album, even though the single "Jammin' Me" (co-written with fellow Traveling Wilbury Bob Dylan) was #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks for four weeks. In addition, this album was made to sound like a live recording, using a technique they borrowed from Dylan.

See "Let Me Up (I've Had Enough) [2009 Japan SHM-CD].log" for rip details. I DID NOT do the rip. We did not have this in FLAC. Petty's discography [Studio only] is represented here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5669128/Tom_Petty_-_Studio_Discography_(Part_1_of_2)_[FLAC]_-_Kitlope. HOWEVER, even though the uploader listed "Let me Up" as included - it IS NOT! So, hence the rational for uploading this torrent.
