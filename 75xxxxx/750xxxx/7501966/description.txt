Late recording (my favorite) of the great Bill Evans in an unusual quintet context.  

With alot of music you can almost tell what's coming next......Not so here.  The 

album endures repeated listenings...it always sounds fresh to me.  The syncopation 

varies constantly....Evans kept getting better....Check out track #6.....I've heard 

most of the Evans discography and this album is a real standout
