,DragonChaserKev,2012-09-01T20:43Z,"A film with a few moments but overly long, amateurish, difficult to watch it you dislike low quality video.  Again just a bad low budget film trying to get people to the theatre with the tagline ""scariest movie ever.""  hahaha  Download this people cause it isn't worth paying a penny for."
,metalyger,2012-09-02T23:51Z,DragonChaserKev sounds like he has the right idea. I haven't seen this yet but free is free. I just feel like it probably will be another castrated attempt at shocking violent films in the same vein as Hostel and Human Centipede. August Underground 1-3 did all there was left to do in the world of gritty found footage. Murder Collection V1 was their way to lash out at internet videos of real violence. V/H/S just sounds like the major studios trying to sucker more people out of their hard earned money knowing they've never seen a real shocking movie before.
