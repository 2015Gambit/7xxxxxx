,upx3,2012-08-05T01:38Z,Does This have the randomly repeating scenes that start just after the 30 min mark ?  Like all the other rips based on the BLOW release. 
,r0ssxx,2012-08-05T03:44Z,Says it's encoded from the re-rip. Re-rip = no repeating scenes unless BLOW fucked up twice.
,rupert3k,2012-08-05T13:28Z,"Although it downloaded fast & seems to play when I skimmed through, all peers seem stuck at 99.8% with 2mb remaining. I see over 200 seeds but cannot connect to any of them, only incomplete peers. Probably just a young torrent glitch"
,rosstitute,2012-08-05T14:10Z,Same issue - stuck at 99.84%
,rosstitute,2012-08-05T17:44Z,Download doesn't complete but after a file rename it seems to play. First 20mins or so are pixelated - looks like up-scaled DVD. Plenty of others that are better than this.
,upx3,2012-08-05T21:04Z,"Brownsugar13 is a Trusted Pirate Bay user ?!?
With Hundreds of seemingly good uploads.
But why would you not completely seed this ?
If there was a mistake, can't you let us know ??
Instead of just leaving it at 99.8%"
