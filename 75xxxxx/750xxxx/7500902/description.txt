I hope this works.

I haven't uploaded a torrent in months because the UK had the pirate bay blocked, and the free uk proxy doesn't allow logging on to upload.

I am trying a us browser proxy, I really hope this works, because I want to continue uploading stuff again. I really like sharing :S.

If this works, then that means I can upload again! Woohoo!
