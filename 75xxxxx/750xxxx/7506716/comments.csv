Why not take it a step further and use something like ""Penguins of Madagascar - 03x18 - The Terror of Madagascar.avi""?

One of the uploaders here (from whom I got /Transformers: Prime/ if memory serves) does something very similar and it's great since I don't have to reformat them to make them readable (my astigmatism means all those periods can give me eye strain, not to mention making it harder to rename the files since ctrl-arrow tends to treat all of the period-separated text as a single word)."
