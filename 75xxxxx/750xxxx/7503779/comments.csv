[T],EvilCraze,2012-08-05T10:10Z,"@xpmule

Windows 8 is a useless piece of shit.
Windows 7 is the new XP and wont go away anytime soon."
,xpmule,2012-08-05T14:38Z,"Its is released actualy and no it is not the released preview it is the finalnon beta rtm ""Gold"" version.

And sorry you are wrong about the version.
Before i opened my mouth i enetered ""Windows loader"" in to my TPB Firefox search box and clicked ok..
And 8 of the first 15 or so entries were v2.1.7

The only thing i can assume here is you never actually searched before uploading your torrent.

Let me assure you the minute a new version of Windows Loader by DAZ is released it is uploaded right away (by lots of people)
Many of these other uploads have more seeds too ;)
Not really sure why a lot of you guys do this. Are we just not using the search box or are we doing this for attention and praise etc ?

What Is Your Problem ?? Even I Can Tell Than You Are Doing This To Grab Attention ??"
,xpmule,2012-08-06T01:28Z,"because i pointed out you were wrong.

1 - Windows 8 is final and released.
2 - The torrent you added is old.

And my uploads ? No sorry i don't do that crap for attention because everything i have uploaded is %100 unique period.

My problem ?
You !
And everyone like you that waste the time energy and bandwidth of millions of users.
For one thing many people are going to assume hat this release you uploaded is something new and probably will download it and play around re-installing etc and *may not even realize that its OLD software !
And this is by far not a 1 time occurence this a chronic epidemic around here. People jsut hammer TPB with re-uploads on a daily basis and its sad because the real unique qualitty releases get burried and forgotten becuase some douche wants his 34th pload of Winrar 4.00 on the first page when 4.20 was already added 22x

This is all very obvious though no ?
I guess not if i had to explain it.."
[T],EvilCraze,2012-08-06T18:13Z,"@xpmule
No One Asked You What To Upload. And About Windows 8 - Its Just Release Preview You Dumb Fuck ! . Google It . Windows 8 Still Not Released . Release Preview Is  Free . 
About People Downloading And Screwing Their PC's - Its Their Problem , They Can Search Before Downloading . TPB Is A Torrent Site Which Allows Users To Upload Anything They Want , Except Fakes . So You Better Mind With Your Buisness ."
,MistaHardkill,2012-08-06T22:54Z,"Actually, it's RTM. Final build. It's ALL OVER TPB. You sir, are the dumb fuck."

,tate1989,2012-08-10T10:03Z,"You folks should stop this useless bickering; it's pointless. I think Evil Craze is right. Some of y'all just come up here and want to demand attention. Don't hate on Evil Craze's torrents because people are downloading 'em. Mr XPMULE, get a life; what the heck, like a cat, get Nine lives! stop player hating. Uploading your own stuff and leave Evil Craze alone."
,tate1989,2012-08-10T10:12Z,"What you wanna upload or download is up to you. If you wanna download, download. If you don't want to, then don't. No one is forcing you to download. so stop fooling around."
,jj_13,2012-08-15T14:12Z,Thanks! It works!
,xpmule,2012-08-25T08:03Z,"you said,
""..And Screwing Their PC's - Its Their Problem"" ?

excuse me but your the one handing them the tools to do it buddy !

And player hating ? LOL

And is the apologies to me ?
And is that before or after you ran to the forum and gave me a negative reputation and called me a ""dumb fuck"" ?

Not the least bit surpised by the response here lol
That's TPB ;)

Go ahead and keep re uploading torrents and making false statements i don;t care.
Just do me a favor and quit harassing me on the forum asshole. I'm the bad guy cause i pointed out your full of shit and contributing nothing ?
LOL what the fuck ever lol

Only reason i came here was because i wanted to see why some random asshole on the forum was calling me names.. and it was YOU Mr. ""Sneaking""

You can get your negative rating in return buddy ;)"
,AxDeath,2012-08-28T06:19Z,"Doesn't do anything for me. No idea what to do with this little applet, and an hour in the forums hasn't taught me much. It simply won't install or uninstall anything without an error, and the error codes are too specific or too vague."
