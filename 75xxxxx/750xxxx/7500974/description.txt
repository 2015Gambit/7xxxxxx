From Rochester, NY, one of the later signings to legendary New York Doo-Wop label Jubilee Records, The Blades Of Grass were one of the prime east coast exponents (along with The Free Design and The Left Banke) of that usually west coast genre of Sunshine Pop.. it's complex, baroque harmonies and optimistic atmosphere having a much overlooked but firm second front in the city that never sleeps.. indeed the group's first hit single "Happy" went head to head in a chart battle with LA's Sunshine Company, as did their version of the Peter Sellers film title-track "I Love You Alice B.Toklas" with Harpers Bizarre shortly afterwards.. though The Blades' version with it's vocal phasing and psychy effect-laden intro and outro, somewhat had the edge stylistically!.. this release includes their only LP from 1967, together with all of their non-LP singles in the original Mono....making the first ever complete collection by these masters of Soft Pop........Some of whose members bizarrely went on to the perhaps more traditional New York arty pursuit of making records on the avant garde ESP label!...
