Never heard of or used AC3Filter until this rip and I'm getting a sneaky suspicion that a lot of those DVD rips with that slightly ""detached but not out of sync"" issue may be down to a filter like this. Might be wrong. Still watchable but I thought I'd mention. Will get back to you all with the results.

cheers

,xjd77,2012-08-07T04:28Z,"I said I'd get back to you. Did two rips of a DVD - one with AC3Filter (default setting) and one without. I flicked between the two rips listening carefully to the audio. The difference was very noticeable.  The audio form AC3Filter was terrible - a cymbal crash in the film opening crash started to sound like white noise and the strings sounded rubbish. 

I'm going to stop seeding this rip. I'll do it again and re-up. Though AC3Filter has a disable option in Settings I'm going to remove it - when something messes with the audio of your rips that much then best to play safe and dump it.
