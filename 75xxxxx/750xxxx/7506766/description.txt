Clinical Neurophysiology, Third Edition will continue the tradition of the previous two volumes by providing a didactic, yet accessible, presentation of electrophysiology in three sections that is of use to both the clinician and the researcher. The first section describes the analysis of electrophysiological waveforms. Section two describes the various methods and techniques of electrophysiological testing. The third section, although short in appearance, has recommendations of symptom complexes and disease entities using electroencephalography, evoked potentials, and nerve conduction studies.
