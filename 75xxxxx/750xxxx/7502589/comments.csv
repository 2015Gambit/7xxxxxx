,Hockeyboy946,2012-08-06T03:53Z,"Hey guys, I've found our problem with not being able to start the quest. Follow these simple steps ^.^

1. Unpack the patch and copy it to Skyrim folder.
2. Unpack Dawnguard and copy the stuff to your Data folder which is in your Skyrim folder.
3. Go to Documents/My Games/Skyrim folder and find SkyrimPrefs.ini
4. Add this line bEnableFileSelection=1 under “[LAUNCHER]” in the file.
5. Start the game over launcher, click on DATA FILES and tick Dawnguard on.
6. Enjoy the DLC.

Works like a charm so far. Also to answer the question that gets asked 50 times every time a new update is release... YES this includes previous updates >_> There's no virus either, this torrent works as advertised."
,jonblazin,2012-08-06T03:58Z,"if you cant see the data files in the launcher go to your save games and find skyrim prefrences . ini . open in notepad

Patch 3 contains whatever updated. 

Patch 6 contains ALL of Patch 3, PLUS whatever it does.

Clear? Oh, you patched it a couple of times, or maybe once, will it work then? YES, THIS WILL WORK FOR IF YOU PATCHED IT AT ANY TIME  OR NO TIME! NO, MEGAN FOX IS NOT IMPRESSED BY YOUR ABILITY TO DOWNLOAD TORRENTS AND THEN ASK STUPID QUESTIONS! YES, YOUR MOM STILL HATES YOU!
