,phat_71,2012-08-17T01:13Z,"How annoying. In general I'm actually one that enjoys the ""filler"" content in Bleach, because it's usually pretty good. So was this arc, right till the end. I found it moronic. There's absolutely no good reason why the final Sword Beast should have been ANY trouble. 7 of the Zanpakuto facing it were Captain-Class, most of the others Lieutenants, so in total 9 of them were from Soul Reapers who had reached Bankai-Level.

Katen-Kyokotsu and Sogyo-no-Kotowari alone can pretty much destroy ANYTHING, so needless to say the end of this arc pissed me off....still, thanks so much for it :D"
