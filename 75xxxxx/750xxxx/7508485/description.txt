The Idiot Cycle follows the world's largest chemical producers:

Dow Chemical, BASF, Bayer, Dupont, Astrazeneca, Monsanto

and how these chemical companies, who manufacture and emit cancer
causing chemical substances, also develop, produce and invest in cancer
treatments, the most profitable disease on the planet.The companies
that produce the chemicals used in the fertilizers are also pharmaceutical
companies, providing the medication to cure the cancers that the same
chemicals cause.


"Everyone should know that the 'war on cancer' is largely a fraud."
Dr. Linus Pauling, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and the
Nobel Prize in chemistry.
