GREAT RACING

Sometimes I think this is more like big boys bumper cars than car racing, the way these guys throw their cars around the circuit and the sheer number of shunts, ROTATIONS (spins) and increasing lots of TANK SLAPPERS (rear end shunts) makes it exciting to

Half A Million dollars worth of racing car, being treated like kids dodgem cars.

GO FOR IT.  The power and roar of the Aussie V8s at speeds up to 260kph and higher, pitting Holden Racing Team -v- Ford Performance Racing -v- Team Vodaphone -v- Jack Daniels - and all the other teams

Racing at its most exciting, and at its best.

Enjoy.
