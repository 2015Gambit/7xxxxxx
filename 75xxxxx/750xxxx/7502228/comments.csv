What happened to the 720p Season 10 Episode 2 ?"
,Expedio,2012-08-05T05:22Z,"I made an account on thepiratebay just to make this comment.

I cannot confirm whether or not there is a tracker on this torrent which is the most important thing to me, however the presence of a tracker does not seem likely.

Getting to my point... This torrent is pretty much perfect quality... It took around 3 hours for me to download however the audio is... I'd say perfect... and the video is... maybe a 9.8? perhaps the slightest bit grainy but THIS is truly 720p. This quality is like I purchased the freaking blu-ray of this season and I'm watching on a brand new flat screen. 

I'm not sure how you managed it sceneline bu very well done. Kudos! "
