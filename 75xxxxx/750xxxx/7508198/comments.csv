,ht0fff,2012-08-06T16:08Z,it's interesting that people cannot even seed a 9 MB file. there are only peers with 0% - awesome.
,ht0fff,2012-08-06T23:13Z,@openarena: can you please re-seed?
,openarena,2012-08-07T08:34Z,"I have maximum upload of 50 Kb/s and 12 new torrents,so pe patient"
,openarena,2012-08-07T08:37Z,"and seeders are responsible too.
Ive just looked at some torrents,
18 mb file, more than 180 MB uploaded, so 10 times but only 3 seeders."
,ht0fff,2012-08-07T08:46Z,"@openarena: I know that it is not your fault. after you stopped the initial seed, somebody did not seed...

Thanks for re-seeding. I'll be seeding this for a while now...

Cheers."
