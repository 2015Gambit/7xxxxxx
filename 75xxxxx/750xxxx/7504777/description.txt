Some 70 years ago, this Atlas was created to document proven and safe operative techniques in common use by general surgeons. Many improvements and changes have occurred in the previous eight editions, but two revolutionary ones were the refi nement and popularization of stapling devices about 30 years ago and the creation of laparoscopic minimally invasive procedures around 1990. Th e fi rst off ered a quick, uniform solution to hand-sewn anastomoses of varying quality, whereas
the latter, fueled by successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy, resulted in signifi cantly faster and less painful recovery by patients. Th ese two techniques are now joined in full fl ower in this edition wherein what was considered advanced laparoscopic technique just a decade ago is now in common use and taught in most surgical residency training programs.
Accordingly, the authors have now added these procedures to the Atlas. Th ey include the following laparoscopic operations: right and left colectomy, distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation, right and left adrenalectomy, bariatric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and adjustable gastric banding,plus transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair,
along with a new laparoscopic anatomy plate for the inguinal region. Additionally, three frequently performed minor but key operations are documented in the chapters on arteriovenous fi stula for dialysis access, subclavian and internal jugular venous access with port placement, and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. Numerous updates to all text and plates have been done, while the chapters on minor rectal procedures, hand infections, tendon repair, and skin graft ing have undergone major
revisions.
