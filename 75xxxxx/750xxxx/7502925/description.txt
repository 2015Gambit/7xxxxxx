Be prepared to be taken deep inside the most stunning eco-friendly dwellings on the planet while watching World's Greenest Homes



11)  Lacemakers House 
World's Greenest Homes travels to Nottingham, England, where an abandoned former warehouse was transformed into an imaginative, 2,000 square-foot eco-home that features 18th century brickwork, a large skylight and glass walkway plus a system that reuses and recycles the entire home's grey and brown water.
Then, ancient Japanese customs and Western eco-architecture blend seamlessly in this unique 1,000 square-foot home in Nagoya, Japan. Perched over a shallow reflecting pool and built over a steep 30-foot drop, the home features moving walls and windows, and a wide-open living area.
Finally, contemporary loft living meets the great outdoors in this 3,000 square-foot Dutch eco-home. With passive solar heating, an insulated green roof, and three walls of double-paned glass, the home is naturally cooled by two ponds and a waterfall.
