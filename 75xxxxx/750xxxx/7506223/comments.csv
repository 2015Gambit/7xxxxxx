,extracube,2012-08-05T17:31Z,doh!  thanks for that. Thanks for all the replies.  Yah just from reading the link above this looks like PRO will be the one most of us regular users will want.

,djjafi,2012-08-06T11:36Z,Have anyone invite for soft-forum.ws?
,japrage_s,2012-08-06T12:28Z,"enterprise's better. if u are home user and only need hte basics, go with pro."
,x_engine,2012-08-06T12:59Z,"japrage_s : thanks for advice, do you know :
That will be able to crack Enterprise version,or crack will be relase only for Win_8 Pro."
,japrage_s,2012-08-06T15:40Z,"i know for a fact that windows 8 pro will be easier to crack because all keys can be used on pro, weather its mak key, volume key, retial key.

enterprise only allows a volume key though, so for enteprise we need a kms emulator/activator."
,PirateWarden,2012-08-07T00:01Z,"@x_engine: You can activate Windows 8 using the guide below.

While in Desktop Mode, right click the bottom left corner. Click ""Command Prompt (Admin)"". Enter these commands line-by-line:
