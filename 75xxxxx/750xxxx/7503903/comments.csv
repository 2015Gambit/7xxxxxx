,dumbson,2012-08-04T20:39Z,so repeated scenes or no?
,dabird4205,2012-08-04T21:19Z,blowies or no?
,ananita,2012-08-04T21:38Z,"downloading... someone, please? is this nuked or not? thanks!!"
,Mirius,2012-08-04T22:48Z,"I have not seen throughout the film yet, but the recap around 30 minutes (which I saw in my previous download) is not in this rerip"
,Pikestr28,2012-08-04T23:44Z,Any word on repeats?
,Red_Mouse,2012-08-05T01:00Z,"Audio: 8
Video: 9
Movie: 9

No repeats! "
,metou,2012-08-05T03:47Z,"Just watched it, no repeats, great quality, didn't see it before, but nothing seemed to be missing... thank you very much"
,lqwwssd,2012-08-05T04:43Z,SEED PLZ!!!
,coykoi,2012-08-05T05:48Z,"Quality looks great, let's hope there's no repeating scenes in this one. Logically as someone else said with the time uploaded, it should be fixed. Can anyone else verify as of yet?"
,FireIsHot,2012-08-05T07:07Z,"Ok, I posted this on the 1080p rip, which btw is up from PublicHD/BOZX and shouldn't have any repeats.

My upload and download ratio is nearly 70% after 6 hrs of downloading I'm at 15.6% with Max Bandwidth Allocation on. Running 5.4 mbps without BT running, With BT running it's .80 mbps

Yet my max download speed is averaging less than 300kbps, can someone explain this to me? Clearly BT is sucking all my speed, yet the torrent won't reflect it, even with low seeders I should be able to be pulling much more.

I'm using a Netgear N Router and ATT DSL.

Thanks in Advance. - Will seed to at least 2-1 since it's an advanced copy."
,Charlie117,2012-08-05T09:38Z,Yes! loved this movie and Jenn is fkin gorgeous. Will seed :)
,Naruto_TB,2012-08-05T16:34Z,@FireIsHot Same for me. I have a 50down/5up connection at home and I have downloaded several other torrents >= 2GB in less than 20-30mins. For some reason this and Battleship 1080p are taking a fair amount of time and i am not even to 20% Ironically I was able to complete the download for both Battleship and THG 700mb versions already.
,o0enzy,2012-08-05T16:43Z,SEEED! :)
,BonsaiBoy,2012-08-05T19:38Z,Just finished downloading (lack of seeders - took about 12 hours) and scanned through it.  No repeats on this one! Totally legit!

,FireIsHot,2012-08-05T22:48Z,"@Naruto_TB - Good to know I'm not the only one, this has happened once before with THOR I believe. Luckily my download picked up a little speed and finished just a little while ago.

But it's crazy how our connections (especially your's being the faster) seem to be going to the download, but not actually increasing it's speed by nearly anything."
,FireIsHot,2012-08-05T23:08Z,"Tried the subs posted before this, I like these better. Up to you to decide.

,kou_7,2012-08-06T06:41Z,thanks for the upload.....gate 7.....
,o0enzy,2012-08-06T07:12Z,Seeding like mad right now
,Naruto_TB,2012-08-06T09:40Z,"@FireisHot Seeded 12.7G, at 90% right now, my girlfriend closed my Utorrent because she felt it was making her lag on certain applications. Almost done, what really pisses me off is that there is a 1080p version now!!"
,SheikYerbouti,2012-08-07T00:23Z,"How is this 720p? The nfo says 
""RESOLUTION...: 1280x528""
That's not 720p, not even 576p (SD DVD)."
,mike953100,2012-08-07T22:45Z,"@ SheikYerbouti 

Yes, this is 720p.  This is widescreen, meaning there are the black bars on the top and bottom of the video.  So, that is why it is not 1280x720.

And man I can't believe that this, the good rerip, is being downloaded so much less than the bad messed up first rip.  ugh"
,crabman61,2012-08-08T08:45Z,this thing is downloading like shit for me.  i have no effing clue why.
,CakeMonster,2012-08-10T14:37Z,"Audio and Video are both great no bugs or anything,

The movie itself is ok, but keep in mind that it does have some logical errors and the primary audience is women and girls :)"
,mactvshows,2012-08-12T05:21Z,"A F*ing waste of time and bandwith, this rip is shit. Do not waste yours, sure at least you want it."
,.Leto.,2012-08-13T03:55Z,"@ CakeMonster ""the primary audience is women and girls :) ""
so that's why I didn't like this movie and was bored for 2 hours!! :D
the rip is perfect though"
,CakeMonster,2012-08-13T16:25Z,"@.Leto.

:)"
,bankhoop,2012-08-13T17:28Z,very slow
,rock53,2012-08-19T08:59Z,"Good movie.

,dafaq,2012-08-22T04:39Z,6gb? THE FUCK!!!!! Does this have Gag reel????
