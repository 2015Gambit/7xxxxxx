,JetsetJoey,2012-09-08T04:32Z,"I've successfully downloaded from ChattChitto MANY times & never a problem. HOWEVER, this time, it says ""Trial User"" & ""Expired.

I followed the instructions EXCACTLY as always!

I even used REVO Uninstaller Pro to remove the previous version! I also rebooted after replacing the DLL file... both of which I've never had to do!!!

Any ideas anyone???"
,JetsetJoey,2012-09-08T16:40Z,"UPDATE:
I've always successfully installed DVDFab & the modified dll but after upgrading to the latest version 8.2.1 it says ""Trial User & Expired."" I've even tried installing various other versions with the same failed result. When starting program it shows a date that's already expired!!!

Any ideans anyone?!?"
