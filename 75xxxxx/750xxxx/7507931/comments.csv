this show is a very underrated show i first heard the She Belongs To Me on a friends Frost show the 
year before as a filler just listened to it in full last night was a rockin show well played too imo 
very solid Smokestack one of the best since the early 70's above mentioned She Belongs To Me too was 
a personal favorite of mine and rocked Comes A Time another killer song played well the Dupree's is 
also played well all in all sound quality a 5 show wise 4.5 hate to go with a 5 so i'll give it a 4

I think the show is better than the other reviews have said. That's a hot Scarlet > Fire, and the 
Twilight Tuning prior to it was great. Very unusual setlist, LONG pre-drums, strangely-placed and 
highly energetic US Blues, and another great '85 Drums/Space... I like this one very much indeed. 
Jerry messes up verses on Comes A Time, but hey, he's got to blow SOME lyrics at just about every 
show, so I'm cool with it :)

This was a very mellow show. I was living in San Diego at the time (actually, this was my last CA show 
before heading back East), so this was just down the road in Chula-juana. I went to a ton of shows that 
year, and don't remember a whole lot about this one other than that it was very comfortable. Not outstanding, 
just really really nice.

I'd been at the Kaiser shows the week before, and the energy here was way different. I used to have a cassette 
of this show, but loaned it to someone who took off with it, so I'm happy to see this here in the archive.

Yea it was one of those absolutely perfect SoCal Summer Day show.... My Aud master sounds so crisp even 
now... Thanks for this wonderful SB...
The most memorable moment was after the show some obviously trippin dude was wandering around on the field 
with no clothes on & a lone security guard walked up & handed him a bandana... Ha & the guy put it on his 
head.... & kept wandering."
