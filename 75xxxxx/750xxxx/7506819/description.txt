Roaring Glory F6F Hellcat, volume 1 of 10, part 1 (checkout and mission) and part 2 (The Young Pilots docudrama). 50min. Part 3, a 1943 vintage training film, is available on u-tube, key words- F6F pilot training.

I have the P-47 (vol 5) and plan to upload it next. If I can find the B-25 Mitchell I'll do that too. 

Please help seed.
