Thank you."
,BasilBrush,2012-08-05T03:58Z,"It's new.

Unfortunately I've only got the first hour of the 3 hour evening session due to lightning which took out the satellite signal at 1 hour into the programme. The evening session included:

Mens Sprint - 1/16 Final Repechages
Women's Team Pursuit - First Round
Men's Sprint - 1/8 Finals
Men's Omnium - 30km Points Race
Men's Sprint - 1/8 Final Repechages
Women's Team Pursuit - Final 7/8

The satellite signal cuts out during the men's sprint at the start of heat 8.

If you want the first hour let me know."
,EdoSensei,2012-08-05T04:03Z,I would assume it's the 3rd day's action. Just started to DL myself.
,sbrtmt,2012-08-05T04:04Z,"Yes, please, thank you!"
,EdoSensei,2012-08-05T04:06Z,"Posted at the same time.

Don't understand what you mean. You say you've only got the 1st hour, which is what I assume you posted up here, then you say if you what the 1st hour to let you know???"
,BasilBrush,2012-08-05T04:21Z,"There's a morning session and evening session. This torrent is the morning session which is complete. The evening session only contains the first hour of a 3 hour programme which will be ready in the morning.

So unfortunately the womens team pursuit final will be missing from the evening session.

There's a similar morning and evening session on Sunday 5th Aug 2012. Hopefully the thunder and lightning will stay away during these sessions."
,EdoSensei,2012-08-05T05:04Z,"Please upload the full 3 hours in the morning if you mean you're recording a repeat, or just even the 1st hour if that's all you'll have.

No one seems to be uploading the BBC Olympic highlight programme, which would be ideal and include the women's pursuit final."
,BasilBrush,2012-08-05T11:37Z,"The morning session is only 96 minutes and is complete. There's no 3 hour morning session.

The evening session is 3 hours but I have only the first 59 minutes of it.

The evening session is coming up. It's called:
Womens Team Pursuit Heats and Mens Sprint Heats"
,BasilBrush,2012-08-05T11:52Z,"Here's the Saturday 4th Aug 2012 evening session with the last 2 hours missing:
