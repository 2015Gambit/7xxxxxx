This is huge and powerful torrent of the Sims 3 Store. Everything in this store is available here(plus all neighborhoods)for free from the very beginning of the game up to July 2012. All 38 updates are inside. All these files are .Sims3Pack (decrap) files. Just put them into the Download folder and start the launcher then simply install!
