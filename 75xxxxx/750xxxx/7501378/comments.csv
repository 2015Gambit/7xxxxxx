,Damitttttt,2012-08-04T12:17Z,How does this work with a soft modded wii?
,Damitttttt,2012-08-04T12:29Z,This has to be burned onto a cd to work right? Or have they finally found a way to play gamecube backups through storage devices?
,LalosTGMTEL,2012-08-04T21:51Z,Dammitttttt you can play gamecube games of USB and SD card with DIOS MIOS
,RadicalSoundWaves,2012-08-04T23:08Z,Why is this under Wii games?
,flashfv,2012-08-05T08:44Z,@Damitttttt works great with Dolphin emulator but your computer has to be decent or you might notice lag. Wii's can play gamecube games so if you mod it you can just burn this to a disc and pop it into your wii. How to softmod a wii google it! Softmoding a wii is pretty easy but you need an sd card or you can't.
,flashfv,2012-08-05T08:46Z,@RadicalSoundWaves I didn't see a gamecube section and since wii can play gamecube games I thought why not?
