,alumman,2012-08-06T19:33Z,"Isnt 720p,1280x720

Why does it say its 720p while its only 1280x536"
,mike953100,2012-08-06T22:48Z,"worthless info as usual from YIFY.  You should include video and audio bitrates at least.  

http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download

Here you can download mediainfo.  After it completes, you can right click on any audio or video information and it will tell you the bitrates, codecs, etc.  Very handy for uploaders like YIFY who choose not to share it with the downloaders."
,mike953100,2012-08-06T22:51Z,"@ alumman 

This is widescreen, so the video is 1280x720 if you include the black bars on top of and underneath the video.  However, the actual video itself is 1280x536."
,Agent_QiQi,2012-08-07T00:33Z,"thanks buddy, keep em coming!"
,Shtefu,2012-08-07T03:11Z,"Hey YIFY just wanted to say a big THX to you and your team. Just noticed recently your torrents and all I've downloaded so far is great.

I like decoding you guys do and especially the fact that you always put subs in your torrents. Keep up the good work man."
,SergioFCPorto,2012-08-07T04:39Z,thanks..good work
,paul211b,2012-08-07T13:56Z,Please can someone tell me why the audio is rubbish stereo only. People giving his torrents A10 are crazy. A bluray rip needs 5 channel sound or what's the point?
,stray_bullets13,2012-08-08T04:22Z,"A/10 (Stereo)
V/10 (SPlayer)
M/10 (F**kin laugh!)"

It had funny moments but overall crappy story. I am sure my friends would love this movie."
,canbetrusted,2012-08-08T21:33Z,"Hey YIFY .. Can you please do The Avengers movie?
I've been waiting a long time for that, and your torrents is the best, i know that for sure =)"
,Nestea_Zen,2012-08-08T23:46Z,"canbetrusted
Like seriously? Is he supposed to pull out of his a**?"
,canbetrusted,2012-08-09T11:22Z,"come on nestea_zen, i'm just asking .. how should i know when it's possible to release that move? "
,samigaara,2012-08-09T23:41Z,i love you YIFY 
,Ashkevron,2012-08-12T07:54Z,nice quality. thanks! +1

YIFY Movies are never true BR quality as the blacks and grays are way to pixelated and gritty. You want  BR quality then download 3GB and larger files. 600MB won't do it."
,robraw101,2012-08-12T15:30Z,"I mean

,robraw101,2012-08-12T15:32Z,YIFY IS A FUCKING DICK.
,tomahawk13,2012-08-14T04:37Z,does this work on the ps3?
,Tinny_pb,2012-08-20T12:05Z,"YIFY didn't claim it was BluRay quality. BBRip refers to the source, not the end result.

A9 V9. Thanks for another great tiny rip."
,Mullard37,2012-08-22T22:41Z,I wish someone could get this junk out of the highres section...it is teeming with stuff like this!! AGH!!!

,peterparkerdatsme,2012-09-08T00:01Z,@Mullard37 Do you even know how big a full BRRip would be? 25 GB--AT LEAST... Not everyone has the speed or unlimited downloads for that type of thing. If you are trying to build some type of top-notch video library--go buy the fucking movies; upload your own shit.
