xScan (formerly CheckUp) has been specifically designed to help you monitor the behavior and health of your Mac in a simple and straightforward manner. This is done in real time. No more needing to go 'beneath the hood' to find out all those technical details that could be affecting your system. We've done all the work for you!

xScan is able to detect common problems with a Mac and OS X, and will also provide useful tips to help you fix them. It's as easy as looking at the dashboard of your car!

The first thing you will likely notice about xScan is the minimal interface. Upon opening xScan, you will be greeted by a simple black Toolbar down the right-hand side of your screen. That is all. This enables you to manage your Mac's system with as little interruption to your work as possible. From the preferences, you can control which side of the screen the Toolbar appears on, and also adjust the Toolbar's Transparency.

A powerful feature of xScan is its ability to alert you to potential problems with your system. xScan is able to detect any hardware failures on your Mac. Recent Macs have sensors integrated into the hardware that xScan uses to assess the state of your system. It can also detect the health of all connected disks and will check if there are any major issues.

Thus, xScan is a great solution in keeping an eye on your Mac!
