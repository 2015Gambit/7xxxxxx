Persona 4 Arena NTSC XBOX360-iMARS

Persona 4 ArenaΓÇÖs battles see you summoning personas using two of the attack buttons, with their precise behaviour depending on the summonerΓÇÖs motion and position. A persona can be damaged and even knocked out, effectively halving a characterΓÇÖs abilities during the healing period. The four-button combat system has only strong and weak attacks, each for you and your persona, and features single button autocombos to ease novices into the mechanics. The ΓÇ£BurstΓÇ¥ combo provides a get-out-of-jail-free card (if you have a full burst meter)ΓÇôif youΓÇÖre getting hammered, you can knock your opponent away with a short stun and a little damage. The hardcore neednΓÇÖt despair though, as further combos and quarter-circle specials allow flowing chains of satisfaction, with the added interplay of simultaneous persona and character combat bringing a host of techniques to the table.

A Lesson mode is also included, a welcome feature in a notoriously inaccessible genre, developing on BlazBlueΓÇÖs Tutorial with smoother transitions between exercises. The mode provides lessons, from moving all the up way to runs of combos and the gameΓÇÖs three types of guard. ArenaΓÇÖs online Versus mode, with all 13 characters available from the off, utilises the same successful netcode as BlazBlue, promising a smooth experience at broadband speeds. If youΓÇÖre trying to move from intermediate to advanced level, youΓÇÖll benefit from the ΓÇ£record a comboΓÇ¥ feature, where you can teach the computer to attack with a specific move, allowing you to perfect a counter. ArenaΓÇÖs Challenge mode, similar to Lesson mode, allows fluid transition to the next task with no bothersome loading screens to break up the flow of play.
