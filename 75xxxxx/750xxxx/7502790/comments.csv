,Damitttttt,2012-08-05T20:59Z,Will this work with the x key cause I downloaded dead island goty and when i load it with xkey it just says its a dvd
[V],boobsman,2012-08-06T00:43Z,"@ ryunax14 no this is NTSC/U only, there is another version for NTSC/J.

@ Damitttttt yes hsould work with xkey as will Dead Island, you need to patch it with wave 15 though before it'll work. Download abgx360 + all the waves 1-15 so you can properly patch all games :)"
