Windows 7 Ultimate Edition 64bit w/activation tool provided by Daz of MyDigitalLife.

PLEASE READ THE README FILE IN THE ACTIVATION FOLDER IT WILL ANSWER ALMOST ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE.

This copy of windows is bare bone. It has no service packs or updates on it to make it easier for the activation software to work. However the activator included in this download is capable of activating windows 7 up to SP1 build.

I take no credit for the activator however I built the ISO myself.

Instructions:
*Burn or mount ISO image file whichever applies to you
*Install windows 7
*DISABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES
*LEAVE KEY BLANK
*Unzip activation folder on disk image
*READ THE README FILE
*Use the activator
*Reboot and enjoy
