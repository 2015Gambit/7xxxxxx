,topjimmy68,2012-08-05T01:55Z,Needs activation by a corporate KMS...curious to see if this can be defeated or emulated in a non-corporate environment.
,Grover_NZ,2012-08-05T06:53Z,Will Daz 2.1.7 work for this? http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7463060/Windows_Loader_2.1.7_By_Daz
,PattyrRob,2012-08-05T15:06Z,@Grover NZ No daz 2.1.7 will not work. It breaks the server.
,topjimmy68,2012-08-07T06:00Z,"Use these commands at elevated command prompt to activate for 180 days (confirmed in VM of Standard edition)

slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato

Same method for Windows 8 Enterprise"

,xpmule,2012-08-08T00:05Z,"can anyone confirm what everyone wants to know ?
Is the UI the same as other versions ?
So for example if people like myself hate the windows 8 metro tile crap does this work or look any better at all ?
Know what im sayin ?"
,topjimmy68,2012-08-11T03:18Z,"It has the Metro UI like Windows 8, but not the store.  After login you are taken straight to the desktop rather than the start screen (tiles).  A little better than Windows 8 for Metro haters, but still no start menu.  Easy to add a third-party start menu though."
,shangxiajiu,2012-09-07T23:29Z,"I downloaded this same file from Microsoft the 180 evaluation 3.4 gig datacenter gui. I called microsoft to get the activation key, it took 67 hours to get it. I installed this file on Oracle Virtual Box. I opened the powershell and typed:
Dism /online /Set-Edition:ServerDatacenter /AcceptEula /ProductKey: xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx

you must observe all spaces colins, and the work productkey does remain in the command.

The xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx, you must replace with a valid key

after entering this sting correctly with a valid key then re-booting yeild a valid copy without the 180 day evaluation watermark.

It will say Windoows Server 2012 Datacenter
Build 9200"
