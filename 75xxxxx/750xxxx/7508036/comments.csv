,lordexodus,2012-08-07T00:42Z,"I need your help. I live in the U.S. & this Friday on August 10 2012, a movie that I'd like to add in my collection will be shown on MoreMaxHDw. It's the 1963 Best Picture ""Tom Jones"". If you can, can you please rip it entirely as an +4GB MKV file & upload it online? As a Best Picture collector, I greatly appreciate your help..."
