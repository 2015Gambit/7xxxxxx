V-7 maybe even 8.
A-7 

Very close to a dvd rip.

Miles away from a bluray."
,zezant,2012-08-07T14:57Z,"I don't get people who rate a cam rip with a 9 or a 10.
A 10 is a bluray rip only.
A 9 is a lame bluray or a great dvd rip.
A 8 I would give to a lame dvd rip.
Usual cam rip's I would gave 4 or a 5.
A 6 in extraordinary cases.
But this deserves a 7 or even a 8.
It is a cam but really the BEST CAM ever."

,deepblue2000,2012-08-07T21:18Z,Cause they all stupid bitches
,jewcifur,2012-08-07T22:47Z,"people can rate shit whatever they want
lil critical thinking would go a long way when taking someone elses opinion into consideration. cause thats what A/V quality ratings are, your fucking opinion t('-'t)"
,epimansg,2012-08-08T05:29Z,"if idiots would read the uploader said ""VIDEO SAME AS BEFORE"" Which you morons would see if you knew how to read and not bleep and moan...he or she also said that the difference is where the Chinese subs show on some this doesn't and the audio has been filtered and eq'd in other...so before you start writing vulgar garbage comments read everything if you know how too that is...."
,zezant,2012-08-08T06:23Z,"jewcifur
Purpose of ratings in this comments is to give other people some notice of what to expect from a rip.
Some people have SLOW internet (256 kb/s or even 128 kb/s) so they relay on our comments to decide which rip (in a sea of bad rip's) to download.
I do respect people opinions but rate a CAM rip with a 9 is just dumb.
With a 10 is insane."
,Super_battle_droid,2012-08-08T16:57Z,"Have to say this is really watchable A/V rating I would say an 6.5 its a cam of course, Although I would recommend raising the camera a little more next time lol there heads get chopped off some times."
,catalyst317,2012-08-08T16:59Z,"zezant, when rating a cam, you can not compare it to blue ray or a dvd, which is why people rate cams 7,8,9,10. They are rating it AS A CAM. Obviously, a cam is not going to be on par with a dvd or blue ray. They rate on THE QUALITY OF THE CAM.
This is why we can not have a universal rating system. No one agrees on a system. "
,beazongirls69,2012-08-08T18:41Z,Looks better than the rest i've DL.. V/A 7 
,jewcifur,2012-08-08T20:07Z,"zezant
true... but the title and info lets you know what sort of quality it is, and if someone gives it a ten, you can infer, its  a damn nice ts rip"
,jewcifur,2012-08-08T20:10Z,"this is a damn nice TS rip btw... id give it a 8 or 9 for video quality, audio isnt too shabby either... but its the quality of the video that really matters to me."
