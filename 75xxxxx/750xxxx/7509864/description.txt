NOTES: 


Ok where too start hmmmmm... 
Video same as before but this time round,where the black widow scene is with chinese subs i have opted too cut 
the subs ...around 10-12 pixels and THEN hardcode subs custom subs.AR goes slightly out for 2mins during this part 
as i needed to resize that scene so i could append it later. 
Audio was great,but i thought i give it some cleaning in AA changing the EQ levels etc. 
Only pita was the audio didn't fit over our encode from before so had too go through and resync it to our rip. 
Without the line source file had to do it the old fashion way and made a few cuts and add different offsets ....took 20 cuts 
too get it right or well dam close anyway lol. 
Heres release 101 enjoy folks .....
