,AndreyATGB,2012-08-04T17:39Z,"Works fine, faster than 7. The removal of Aero makes it look better now IMO. Note the permanent Windows 8 Enterprise N Build 9200 thing on the desktop. That isn't bad, the bad thing is the watermark that says Activate Windows. It never goes away since you obviously can't activate it. It doesn't seem to affect day to day usage for me."
