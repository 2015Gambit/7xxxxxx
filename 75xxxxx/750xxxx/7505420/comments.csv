,Caf1000,2012-08-05T16:37Z,Why would you put all the files in a single archive?
,nbrazil,2012-08-05T17:46Z,"Yes, this one big file approach is really inconvenient. I only want the older series. I already have the newer series and if my source is the same I can use my copies to help seed immediately.

As it is, because I cannot tell what is in this, I'm not going to have anything to do with it."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-06T00:33Z,"@ Caf1000:  simply unzip the downloaded file and u will get:  a folder of Appearances; a folder of Annuals (all 4); a folder of Volume 1 (all 62 issues); and a folder of Volume 2 (all 25 issues).  its just that simple.

@nbrazil:  you can tell what this is if u read the description, ""torrent includes:  all issues of both Volumes; all four GOTG Annuals; plus some of the appearances of the GOG Gang in various other publications over the years.""  Plus, the word ""Complete"" is in the title and that should tell you something."
,Caf1000,2012-08-06T03:02Z,"I've got a low usage limit. I'm not going to lose 2,3 Gb of it (including seeding) for the couple issues & few guest appearances I might not have. I appreciate your work, but it doesn't work for me."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-06T08:52Z,"@Caf1000:  thanx for stopping by and sharing ur negativity.  i hope u get to feeling better, soonest."
,jclock,2012-08-06T16:39Z,Caf1000 and Brazil have a point. Putting it all into one archive doesn't help. Now people have to download the whole thing or nothing and it doesn't save on file size since cbr and cbz files are already compressed. I suggest for future uploads to just use folders instead of compressed monolithic archives
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-06T19:49Z,@jclock:  meh
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-06T20:02Z,"@ jclock:  already, 100s of people have dl'd this torrent sans complaint; a few have even returned to give a +1; only 1 (you?) gave a -1; i do believe ur, Caf100 and nbrazil's thinking is atypical.  also, 1.5 gigs is hardly monolithic; have u seen this superb effort:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6766105/MTCDC-NMC_44_DC_from_Superb-Swd_(except_Superman)(joshua13

,reboot2099,2012-08-06T21:25Z,"@SplhcbPrime: I think you're taking the comments way too personnal. What those people are trying to do is not criticize you and saying you did the worst job ever.

We all appreciate your effort. All we (and I include myself, because I agree with them) try to do is just improve your torrents so they please more people. You're saying 100 people downloaded this. That's great. That doesn't mean that if you followed the advice of others, even more people would've downloaded and appreciated it.

The problem is that some people want just a few of those issues. Why download 1.5g if they only want 200mb of stuff? I am in this boat. I don't want to download more than I want, otherwise my download limit will be used way too soon.

And RARing them all together doesn't make sense, as others mentioned, because cbr are ALREADY compressed files.

I think most people here are being very grateful for your hard work and want you to keep doing it. And reading their comments, it's obvious they did not attack you, they just gave constructive criticism. Please take that into account. We are just trying to help you improve. That's it. 

No hard feelings, continue with your hard work, please :)"
,reboot2099,2012-08-06T21:29Z,"Oh, and the torrent you linked to show that 1.5k is not too bad a download? That just illustrates how we want you to do things.

The guy didn't put all those comics in one RAR. You can download just a few of them, you don't HAVE to download the 15gig if you don't want them.

That's really what this is about. Not the file size, but the ability to download only the issues you want. That's it :)"
,Caf1000,2012-08-07T01:49Z,"No negativity man. Not everyone has unlimited access. When you have a 25 Gb monthly limit  and WANT to seed anything you download, 2-3 Gb is alot to waste for comics I already have, for only possibly 100Mb of stuff I don't. I've had unlimited before, but its unavailable where I am.
As I said, I appreciate the work that went into this, and I'm not trying to denigrate it. Hundreds of people have downloaded this, sure. How many didn't touch it for reasons similar to mine but didn""t bother to tell you? You'll never know. 
You don't have to do things differently for my sake. If you put up a set I don't have at all (like e.g. early Luke Cage stuff) I'll grab it. The whole purpose of this site is to share stuff, not to exclude people. 
If you prefer this system however, may I suggest you add a list of the comics in the file, inculding the cameos, like the superb MTCDC uploader does. Ive used those torrents, picking just the files I wanted.
Peace"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-08T02:52Z,"@reboot:  i understand what u r saying; can u instruct me please, on how to dl just Superboy/Superboy & the Legion of Super-Heroes v1 231-258 (1977-1979)/Superboy & the Legion of Super-Heroes v1 250 ctc (04-1979).cbr from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6766105/MTCDC-NMC_44_DC_from_Superb-Swd_(except_Superman)(joshua13  ?  this is the only issue i am missing from my superboy collection and u say its possible to grab this one .cbr from this excellent torrent.  please enlighten me as to how this is done.  thank you ahead of time..."
,Caf1000,2012-08-08T03:25Z,"I can help with that, if you use utorrent.
The process has been described better than I could say here:
http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=117970
If not, just post your client."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-08T04:06Z,"hmmm, Caf1000:  following the instructions in ur link, Force Start is grayed out.  Any other ideas?"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-08T05:37Z,"@Caf1000 & reboot2099, too:  OK, I get as far as the Files tab, but get lost on how to select just the ONE file I wanna dl; any help would be appreciated as the link u supplied goes awry at that point.  thanx ahead of time..."
,Caf1000,2012-08-08T13:21Z,"If you are just trying to select one file, best way is to select all files (ctrl+a) when you're focused on the files tab, then when they are all selected ctrl+click on the file you want to get to deselect it.  Then right click on the selected files and click on 'don't download'. Then you should be able to start the torrent with just your selected file."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-08T21:22Z,"@Caf1000:  i tried all that, even before i asked for guidance, but no go.  i agree i should be able to start the torrent and dl just that one file, but thewhol torrent is trying to come in.  no biggee.   thanx for trying to help."
,Caf1000,2012-08-09T14:12Z,"I've uploaded the single file for ya here: 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7517550
I'll seed till you get it."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-09T14:57Z,@Caf1000:  you can stop seeding superboy250 already; danka.
,Caf1000,2012-08-10T01:40Z,"Coolness, enjoy:)"
,reboot2099,2012-08-10T07:24Z,"Well, I forgot to check this link for new comments for a couple days. Sorry I couldn't help you, SplhcbPrime. :(

But I am glad Caf1000 did help you and you both made peace with each other! :)"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-18T04:06Z,"IF this was a 50 GB torrent, then yea I could see making a fuss about the zipped format. But it's 1.5 GB!!!!!

Yea it's nice to just pick what you want, but for a majority of people these days, something this size is going to take all of 5 minutes to download and is going to put a miniscule dent in their bandwidth limit (Comcast just increased theirs, and did away with it in some areas....)

Thanks a bunch SplhcbPrime!"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-08-18T23:56Z,"Thanx for the support, FriendlySpidey.  You've mimicked my thoughts exactly.  My apologies to all for the unnecessary debate."
