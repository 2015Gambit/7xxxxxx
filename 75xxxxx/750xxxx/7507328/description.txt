Notes

So we grabbed devildeeds vid as it seemed best
that was out there ran smoother/sharpen/resize
and tweaked colours abit then muxed our line
which i must say is pretty badboy theres 3 spots
throughout the film where theres a slight hiss and
never lasts longer than a few seconds so please enjoy
this till better soarce comes out
