,sempressa,2012-08-04T23:46Z,"Ok, sceneline! :(
Thanks anyway!"
,brown_turd,2012-08-05T00:28Z,"sempressa - there was no Day 2 720p CTV release ever done.  It doesn't exist.  The only Day 2 rip that was done thus far was London.2012.Swimming.Day2.Finals.720p.HDTV.x264-OLYMPIANS which is a British feed I think.  And the mSD 480p release of Day2 is just a re-encode of the previous mentioned one.  I watched it, it's a perfect rip, just has British announcers.  I've watched swimming from the USA, CAN, and UK feeds and they all do a good job.  Of course the Country who's feed it is will boast & chat more about the athletes from their Country, but they all give good proper respect to all contestants in the swimming.  Hope this helps.  =)"

[T],xybrite,2012-08-05T08:54Z,I am looking forward to Day7 too.!
,sempressa,2012-08-05T17:50Z,"@brown_turd, thank you for the explanation.
I agree that all groups do a good job. They all have my respect."
,brown_turd,2012-08-05T19:52Z,"@xybrite the Track & Field events will run August 3 â August 12th.  It looks like only day 1 of it has been ripped online =(  If you do need day 1, its at thepiratebay.se/torrent/7504552/"
