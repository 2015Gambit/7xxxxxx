Without using the customary Clifford algebras frequently studied in connection with therepresentations of orthogonal groups, this book gives an elementary introduction to the two-component spinor formalism for four-dimensional spaces with any signature. Some of the useful applications of four-dimensional spinors, such as YangΓÇôMills theory, are derived in detail using illustrative examples.Spinors in Four-Dimensional Spaces is aimed at graduate students and researchers inmathematical and theoretical physics interested in the applications of the two-component spinor formalism in any four-dimensional vector space or Riemannian manifold with a definite or indefinite metric tensor. This systematic and self-contained book is suitable as a seminar text, a reference book, and a self-study guide.
