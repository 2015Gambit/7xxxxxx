The year is 1947, and little Miss Milano is standing by the car in front the bank, acting as lookout when Logan ΓÇ£The LoverΓÇ¥ Pierce comes flying out of the bank holding a sack of cash followed by a hailstorm of bullets. But Logan ainΓÇÖt not chicken, and he battles it out with the law for his booty. The action really excites little Miss Milano, and when Logan outguns the law, little Miss Milano rewards her man the only way she knows how, in The Score.
