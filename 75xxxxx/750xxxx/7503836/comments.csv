,japrage_s,2012-08-05T13:18Z,"3370 is the commercial final release yes but it is a russian version. there is no final 3370 version supporting windows 8 rtm 9200 either.

wait for offical 3370 to appear on US/UK/european kaspersky website first.

this shit is from russian kaspersky.ru"

,bigjohnman,2012-08-05T21:43Z,"Kaspersky is very good at blocking illegal users. Especially when they see thousands of people using the same key when getting updates. You will be blocked. Its just a matter of time.
If I had hacked this software, I wouldn't release it, because it would mean that my hack would be noticed by the company, and disabled."

Am i doing something wrong here?"
,japrage_s,2012-08-08T21:55Z,"this build like i said earlier is final build for winxp, vista, win7, it does not install on windows 8 rtm.

windows 8 still has beta builds because lots lots of problems on windows 8 and kasperksy team needs weeks/months to solve them and create final build for windows 8.
