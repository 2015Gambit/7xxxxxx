,netizenmx,2012-08-07T03:04Z,Can't get the patch to work... it says that 'only apps from app store or licensed developers' apps will be able to run on mountain lion. Or something like that... LOL
,pethron,2012-08-09T09:52Z,"just right click the ""patch"" and choose open from the menu ;) then it will ask for OK to run...."
,supsee,2012-08-13T01:36Z,"This works perfectly. If you deleted an older free version of Alfred, make sure to also 'quit' the menu bar icon. "
,TUNDR4,2012-08-26T19:34Z,"1) Drag Alfred to your Application folder
2) unzip Patch
3) drag patch to your application folder
4) open patcher
5) drag Alfred on it
 that's what i did and it works...my only question is can we update it? "
