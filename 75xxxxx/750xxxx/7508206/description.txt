seems even the scene cappers get screwed up with audio sync problems too :)
they were really screwed.. audio drifted 6000secs every 5min LOL

atleast if mine are out normally its a weebit out over whole file
but I normally check them before uploading randomly throughout

this convert looks good to me randomly checked it
