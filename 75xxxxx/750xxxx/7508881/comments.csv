,MetalMatt138,2012-08-13T05:30Z,"I downloaded and installed, everything opens and works just fine. No serial needed.

I used Disk Utility to open the .toast files, the .dmg files open right up.

The version numbers are: Motion 5, Compressor 4, and Final Cut X, just as the title of the thread says."
,tora-tai,2012-08-16T19:10Z,"@MetalMatt138
Those are not version numbers... Which version 5 is it? These are the versions that are up to date:

Final Cut Pro X 10.0.5
Motion 5.0.4
Compressor 4.0.4

Older version are not much of interest, because they have been torrented here already for a long time now."
