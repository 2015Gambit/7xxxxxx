What's on the DVD
*****************************

Each of this bookΓÇÖs lessons contains one or more Try It sections that 
enable you to practice the concepts covered by that lesson. The Try It 
includes a high-level overview, requirements, and step-by-step 
instructions explaining how to build the example.

This DVD contains video screencasts showing a computer screen as we 
work through key pieces of the Try Its from each lesson. In the audio 
we explain what weΓÇÖre doing step-by-step so you can see how the 
techniques described in the lesson translate into actions. (Note that 
Lesson 4 does not have an accompanying video lesson.)
