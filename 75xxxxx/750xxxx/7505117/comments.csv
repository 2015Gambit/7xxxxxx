Stuff like Men's Trampoline and Handball is pre'n yet no major consistent source for the Basketball games!  So hats off my friend.  This one will be way better for me to watch, rather the other one that's in Russian, hehe.  p.s. ignore all the haters.  people who know respect, show respect. Cheers!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-05T12:46Z,"Thank you, my friend! Really nice words. I prefere to up all the stuff in english but it's so hard to find.. I've could up more stuff from the Olympic game but it's all commented in russian. Cheers, bro!"
,tibird,2012-08-05T15:23Z,thanks I too appreciate your efforts. keep up the great work. Its nice to know that your trying to bring us the english coverage. again thanks
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-05T17:50Z,"You're welcome, mate! Yes I try, but when I can't I think russian version is better then nothing"
,leibei,2012-08-05T18:35Z,"Actually the European Broadcasting Union, provides the original feeds with DVR functions at eurovisionsports.tv, just without any commentary and in 640x360 with a bad picture quality. But no commentary is better than not watching stuff at all. I haven't figured out a way to record it yet (except for filming the thing...)."

,ChasUGC,2012-08-06T00:51Z,"I don't know how to play this without a lot of ghosting in VLC player. If you burn it, the DVD player is fast enough to keep up. I wish there was a way to play it as clearly with VLC player. If anyone has a solution please respond."
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-06T01:58Z,"You're welcome FBIOBSERVER! Cheers, mate!
@ChasUGC: I really don't figure out why you can play an mkv file with VLC Player. Maybe you don't have the codec or something... Sorry, bro, I really don't know. If anybody else knows, please help!"
,ChasUGC,2012-08-06T03:41Z,"I can play it on VLC player, it just can't seem to keep up with the frame rate and I get a lot of ghosting. If I burn it with ConvertX to DVD, the video play perfectly on my DVD player, with no hanging pixels or ghosting. Never saw this problem before.

I have a new laptop, less than a year old running W7 64bit with 4GB Ram.  Any clues anyone?"
,inoxusrd,2012-08-06T04:13Z,@ChasUGC i have the same problem!
,brown_turd,2012-08-06T07:28Z,"ChasUGC & inoxusrd - I'm not sure why you're having problems with VLC...?  I watched it on VLC myself and had no issues.. it's a GREAT quality rip too.  I also copied the .mkv over on a flash drive & watched it on TV with my WDTV Live media player without any problems too.  I run Win7 x64 Pro i7 12GB RAM GeForce GTX 560 w/ 2GB on-board RAM.  I can also run the skip bar back & forth in VLC on the game really quickly and move the whole frame around the screen without any pixelation or ghosting..  So I'm not sure??  Maybe the big .mkv file is a little too much for your video card??  If you're running Win7 and using VLC then you have all required codecs already to watch this .mkv file.  Sorry, wish I could give an exact answer, but not totally sure why it does that for you :-?"
