For those who need some help:

1. Disable virus and malware protection - they won't like the keygen - they never do :-)
2. Disable your internet connection - never hurts
3. Extract the rar somewhere
4. Run keygen.exe (run it sandboxed using Sandboxie! - if you don't have Sandboxie, get it now from TPB - run your keygens sandboxed and you won't ever have to worry about trojans). If you're a pussy, see the serial and activation numbers below.
5. In the keygen Liscense section, hit the little down arrow and scroll down and select ""IMSI Turbocad Platinum v18"" 
6. Press the Generate button and copy the Serial to clipboard for later use
7. Run the TurboCAD setup exe
8. When it asks for a serial number paste in the one from the keygen
9. When TurboCAD finishes installing, run it
10. The Activation box pops up - select Activate by Phone
11. Leave the phone number blank. It's got the serial you pasted earlier alread. Now type the Activation number from the keygen into the Activation box (copy and paste won't work here).
12. Go on - it's your dude!

BTW - even though the setup stuff says Turbocad Professional it really is the Platinum Edition v18.2. If you don't believe it look at Help/About

If you're scared of Core's great keygen and too fukin lazy too use Sandboxie, here are few number sets that will work.
