Just how bad does RomneyΓÇÖs plan hit the middle class?  For that,Michael turned to Dean Baker (Co-Director of the Center for Economic Policy and Research). Meantime, compared the Obama and Romney tax plans and how they will specifically impact your family with the Obama campaign's online tax calculator.

Why on earth was Twitter getting on the great young gymnast Gabby Douglas over her hair?  Michael explained in an edition of Dyson-ary.
