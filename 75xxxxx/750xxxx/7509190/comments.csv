,Puxes,2012-08-06T21:37Z,Finally Admz0r! It was long But it was worth the wait Thank you. :-)
,SimKelly91,2012-08-07T01:24Z,"I have noticed that there is something wrong with the chocolate fountain, here are some of the errors:

 - My sim is holding something invisible everytime I refill the fountain

- the straw is INVISIBLE

- the ""Have Some"" doesn't work because everytime I click ""have some"" NOTHING HAPPENS!"
,CookieMonstaar,2012-08-07T03:28Z,The same prob SimKelly is having is  happening to me the chocolate fountain is not working.
,abet17,2012-08-07T15:22Z,"thanks :)
can you upload others store content from the start? or upload every month from 2009
i like your update because its more detailed than others.. thanks again"
,admz0r,2012-08-07T15:27Z,"Did u put EVERYTHING into the right location? I guess not.  Read the FULL description again and try again. I did it in the same way and everything is ok with the choc-o-fountain for me. I tried it on an other pc and the fix was working correctly, plus no complains on this fix in the creators forum. Good luck"
,admz0r,2012-08-07T15:30Z,"@abet17 sorry, but im not able to collect every month set back to 2009 :( im doing this from 2012 and im planning to continue;)
"
,Puxes,2012-08-07T17:24Z,"IF u guys read the Description it tells u everything..
I did exactly as the Desc. Says and everything came out fine."
,abet17,2012-08-07T22:49Z,"@admz0r ok looking forward for your updates :)
if you have problem w/the package try this it will convert your simspack to package but it will not guarantee it will work, dont use mod if you dont know how it works it will ruin your game
http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=364038&c=1 this is simspack converter to package"
,admz0r,2012-08-07T23:47Z,"Thanks for trying to help but as u can see im uploading both sim3packs and package too in every month ,because u guys requested it:) so i havent got problems making them :)"
,r1ddl3,2012-08-08T08:34Z,"Does anyone here could please tell me which torrent (2011 store items an bellow) to get that will work with admz0r store updates?

I've tried a couple ones but they are not working. 

admz0r are you going to do a compilation any time soon? That would be great! XD

And by the way, thanks for the torrents."
,md.giga,2012-08-08T14:09Z,thanks admz0r.
,admz0r,2012-08-10T15:40Z,"sorry man ,but im not going to make 2011 store updates month-by-month :("
,MrBrainStain16,2012-08-10T22:36Z,"hi sorry for sounding stupid but never done your store updates before and i got the first part but i do not know where to put the: 
KT_StoreFix_DecrapFixes.package
-KT_StoreFix_Fixes_decrapped.package
-KT_StoreFix_UnAwesome.packag
and what to do after please help ?? :("
,admz0r,2012-08-15T00:07Z,"@MrBrainStain16:
it depends on what format u using, i mean the sim3packs or the package file. If u use the package file, u have to put those fixes to: C:-Users--Documents-Electronic Arts-The Sims 3-Mods-Overrides, but if u take the sim3packs and installing them via launcher u have to place those files to: C:-Users--Documents-Electronic Arts-The Sims 3-Mods-Packages. Hope you do well! Good luck!"
,kakosenazvati,2012-08-22T20:15Z,Thak you for this! We are waiting for Sunlit Tides :)
