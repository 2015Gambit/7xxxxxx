Here's the complete July update, and as many of you like in .package, I also included the June package too in this torrent (I will do in this way from now, so you can find both format in the same torrent file!) .sim3pack included too, you can find them in seperate folders. The .sim3pack's decrapified, and rigfixed, of course.
It's a month set, not like shits on TPB (missing items, previous month items,etc), if you want to get ALL the updates released in current month, always take mine. 

So there's a FiXER_v3 folder in the torrent (which fixes the new bugged items), you have to use the .packages inside to get work some new items, which got fucked up, because of the decrapifier. If you do this right, everything is going to work. (see below)
