Requirements: Android 2.0+
Overview: This app unlocks the Plus features in LauncherPro.


You must have the latest version of LauncherPro (free) installed on your phone. This app will not show in your

app drawer and it just acts as a license key to unlock the Plus features.
After installing this, restart LauncherPro (by clicking Menu > Preferences > Restart LauncherPro) and you

should now be running LauncherPro Plus. You can check this by pressing Menu > Preferences, then under

LauncherPro it should say "LauncherPro Plus vX.XX"
This Unlocker only works with the official LauncherPro releases. Modded/themed versions of LauncherPro will not be unlocked by this app.
