,pirateradiorocks2,2012-08-04T04:33Z,"Great!  Thanks for this upload and all the time/effort you put into sharing ALL these torrents!!!

I was wondering, oh torrent master, if you might be able to work your magic on Che pts 1,2 into a single 480p or 576p version w/eng srt or dubbed eng?  I've yet to come across a quality copy of it to match your typical quality and I think that it paints an honest portrait not found often of him and what really happened.    Thanks!  prr2"

[V],twentyforty,2012-08-05T16:42Z,"@pirateradiorocks2; ""Che"" is special case. Part one is classical movie for cinemas, 2.35 AR and ""Che"" Part 2 is in TV format 16/9. Both parts differ in quality AND, as I said, in screen-format. So, ANY joining is out of the question, I can rip second blu-ray and letterbox picture, to equalize the screen-format, but it is stupid and without any logic.
One day, maybe, I would upload my encoding of Che, with English subtitles and, because original audio and spoken language is Spanish, I  would never do heresy and make Che Guevara an Englishman."
