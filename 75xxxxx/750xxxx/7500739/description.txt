Although it was a 1970s made-for-TV movie, many baby boomers consider the flick a cult classic. Quotes of "He's a born showman", "A dead neighbor and all six apples", and "Your ruby red lips taste like prairie dust" are embedded in the minds of those that love the film[citation needed]. Its rapid-paced style of humor can also be seen in many later films, most notably Airplane!.
