iSerial Reader is a program for Mac that contains a library of serial codes for various programs which you can update monthly by getting the most recent Serial Box.

Serial Box is a database containing serial numbers for software as well as hack/crack information. The serials themselves are often 'shared' by a single purchaser who has submitted their serial to Serial Box's authors (although the legality of this in relation to a software vendors SLA is questionable).
Using Serial Box in no way ensures that you are clear of copyright infringement issues. Using someone else's serial number from serial box means that any networked computer is liable to deauthorize in the event that a program with the same serial number is also connected. That being said, it's best to use programs that are authorized with serial box serial numbers offline only.
