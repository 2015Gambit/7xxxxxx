Description:

Evidences of the Bible:
Fred Williams is the co-host of the Real Science Friday radio show (http://RealScienceFriday.com) that airs every Friday at 3:00pm MT.
Fred's topic is titled "Evidences of the Bible." Fred has been engaging Bible skeptics for many years and has compiled answers to a wide range of questions and criticisms leveled against the Bible. His presentation on Bible apologetics not only provides solid answers to the skeptics, but also lays out a powerful line of evidence showing that the Bible must be divinely inspired. Topics include accuracy of prophecy, findings in archeology, scientific knowledge before its time, textual integrity, and much more.

Fred is a member of the Rocky Mountain Creation Fellowship (http://youngearth.org) Board of Directors, Fred Williams. He has been giving lectures on creation for over 17 years to churches, schools, conferences, and other organizations.


Hi-Tech Society Before Noah's Flood:
Pastor Billy Crone provides proof that a hi-tech society did exist before Noah's Flood destroyed the earth, when men became too wicked.


Creation Science Confirms the Bible Is True: 
http://answersingenesis.org In 1859, Charles Darwin published his infamous work On the Origin of Species. More than any other, this single work changed the way the world viewed the origin of life and relied heavily on natural selection and mutation to support its claim.
