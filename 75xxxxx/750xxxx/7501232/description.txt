Ape Escape


In a genre that often lacks originality, Ape Escape shines with 
innovations that utilize the DualShock controller like never before. 
Each level in Ape Escape requires you to capture a set number of 
apes using a variety of gadgets which are provided by the mad 
professor (who let all the monkeys loose in the first place). The 
control is definitely a plus of this game -- the left stick on the 
pad controls the movement of the main character, the right stick 
operates the chosen weapon or tool and points it in whichever 
direction you choose. Extensive use of the two sticks is necessary 
throughout the game for everything from swimming to rowing a boat.
