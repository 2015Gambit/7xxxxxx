,trzrj,2012-08-17T06:21Z,"I stream this movie to my 50 inch Panasonic TH-P50ST50 Plasma TV, through a PS3 (using PS3 Media Server)  & Onkyo TX-NR809 7.1 Home Theatre receiver & KEF Sub/Sat speakers. The audio from the movie is 5.1 and sounds just fine. The video is very good as well. Those that are having problems need to look at their gear/codec/player. Thanks seeder."
