Release Notes:

Recorded at Alabama s legendary Muscle Shoals Sound with additional sessions at
Auerbach s Easy Eye Sound System in Akron and the Bunker in Brooklyn, the album
sees production duties handled by The Black Keys, along with shared duties
between the band, Mark Neill, and their old friend Danger Mouse, who lends his
skilled hands to a new track. Tchad Blake brings his sonic excellence into the
fold to handle mixing duties Muscle Shoals has produced iconic recordings from
The Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, and Wilson Pickett, among many others

Carney admits "Brothers" is the album they ve always wanted to make and taps
into their creative force as a duo. 'Dan and I grew up a lot as individuals and
musicians prior to making this album. Our relationship was tested in many ways
but at the end of the day, we re brothers, and I think these songs reflect
that'. The ghosts of Muscle Shoals inhabit "Brothers"' 15 tracks

Of the album, Auerbach says, 'We like spooky sounds like Alice Coltrane, where
a dark groove is laid down. That s the headspace we tried to get into for this
record'. The album includes the Danger Mouse-produced song "Tighten Up" and a
cover of the Jerry Butler classic "Never Gonna Give You Up"
