Jose CID is a pretty famous Portuguese musician who recorded one incredibly awesome progressive monster concept album in 1978. "10,000 Depois Entre Venus E Marte" is a space-influenced prog album featuring a ton of vintage keybords (Moogs, piano, and Mellotron). Songs and melodies are very captivating and the overall feel is highly symphonic with lots of string synths and mellotron. The Art Sublime CD also contains a rare single released in 1977 which is also very fitting and excellent work. Lyrics are sung in native Portuguese and are quite well done. The guitar work on this album is also amazing and works well with the keyboards... fans of spacey French symphonic rock will love this one.
