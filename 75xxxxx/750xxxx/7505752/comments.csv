Love it when people take a copy that has be uploaded by someone else,  do nothing to it...and then claim to be theirs......

Anywhoo..in accordance to the neutral standard of quality, based on quality of viewing and sound:


V= 3
A= 3

And please, pretty please, stop the hardcoded subs..so we have the 'option' of having them or NOT."
,devnakshi,2012-08-06T08:19Z,Hindi is more preferred to me. But the video/audio quality is always bad. Better wait for other source.
,TeamCC,2012-08-06T15:13Z,When The Better Source Is Available I Will Definatly Post... And Also In English
,DreaD151,2012-08-06T16:18Z,thanks Team CC I know its hard right now to get good versions ...... I am just still damn curious to where the hell all these peoples iphones and droids are at  with those damn 14mp hd cameras in the back and we are gettin these 1999 sony handicam version or no wait a 1988 RCA VHS Camcorder that has a total of 2X optical zooom!!! Oooooooo Ahhhhhhhh!!! hahhaha But in Team CCs case and eveyone else who writes torrents and cleans up the video you take what you can get and sometimes its shitty...
