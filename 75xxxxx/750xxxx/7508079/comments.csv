And I've been saying the same thing for months. These rared releases are amateurish, annoying, and utterly pointless.

I only disagree with dasracht on one point. (I understand he needs to make a strong point to combat fanbois and therefore he is willing to resort to outright lies to make his point. But it's ok because I will set him straight here)

releasing the file in a bunch of rars does NOT defeat the inherent error checking of the torrent protocal. Whether it's a single file with an error or a rar file with an error, it works the same: a checksum won't match and the piece will be reacquired.

The fact that it's a bunch of archives rather than a single or multiple direct media files changes nothing. The torrent protocol doesn't care about format. My guess is that dasracht, despite having a great overall point with which I agree 100% (FUCK SCENELINE AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD THEIR RELEASES. DO NOT SUPPORT THEM), is quite unintelligent with a very low IQ and pitiful knowledge of computer science, compression, and file distribution protocols."
