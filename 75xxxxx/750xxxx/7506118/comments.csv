I'm digging in my archieves for a very special version of ""Like a Rolling Stone"". It was from a Rockpalast concert in Gruga Halle at Duesseldorf / Germany and it was about 1978 and the group called themselves ""Spirit"". They also played a song ""1984"" and I remember the virtuouse guitarist singing ""1984 's knocking at your door ..."" and then he cried ""It's just six years from today"". I really thought 'it's a long time' (I was 18 years old) - now it's really a long time to 1984, but in the past! I've got this concert vid some years before, but lent it to a friend. I'm looking forward that I once get it back and then I'll post it for you (and JumingPhil and Dehou and all the rest of the deaf, thumb and blind kids who only consumate but don't communicate or at least send 1000s of thanks to you. Let's continue your project at least to part 1000. beaujoulais"
