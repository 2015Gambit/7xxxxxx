WITHOUT THE REPEAT SCENES AT 30, 51, and 102 MINUTES!!!!!  THANK YOU>>>SEEEEEED!!!"
,module409,2012-08-09T12:00Z,"the 3.4? GB file by Majestic doesn't have any repeating glitch scenes either. It does pixilate in the dark scenes though. Other than that, it's great. Just looking for 1 that doesn't EVER pixilate. I know...good luck!! It's banned via NZB Matrix. So, it's torrents or nothing. If some dark scene pixilation is ok by you, definitely grab the Majestic file. It's an underdog, here! "
