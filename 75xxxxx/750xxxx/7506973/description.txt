FunnyBones was a Welsh children's television series that was first aired in Welsh on S4C and in English on the BBC in 1992. It was based on the eponymous series of books by Janet and Allan Ahlberg which were illustrated by Andre Amstutz and focused on the adventures of a gang of skeletons. There was the Big Skeleton (whose catchphrase was "Good idea!"), the Little Skeleton, (who was the brains of the outfit), and the Dog Skeleton. Each episode was 5 minutes in length.

A BBC video entitled "FunnyBones - Bumps in the Night" which contained all 12 episodes was released soon after the series ended
