Notes From Above is the program that explores the intersection of music and faith. Hosted by Tom Loewe and Sister Sarah Burdick from the Servants of God's Love, the show airs every Sunday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., with encores on Wednesday and Saturday at 9:00 p.m. (All times are EST). NFA is an entertaining and eclectic mix of interviews, discussion, prayer and music. The program cuts across the breadth of the musical spectrum from Bluegrass to Beethoven, from Chant to Contemporary Christian, from Jazz to Mass Choir Black Gospel -- we've even done shows about the gospel hymns of Elvis Presley. Recent interviews include discussions about the contemplative life with John Michael Talbot, the craft of songwriting with Michael Card, the use of organ music in a liturgical setting with Dick Wallace, and Marian dogma with convert Alex Jones. You never know what you'll hear next on "Notes From Above," but we're certain that you'll tune in week after week. Notes From Above is fun, entertaining, and inspirational.
