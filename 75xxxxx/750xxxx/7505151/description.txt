Synopsis : Sethu (Kamal Haasan) and Ranjani (Rekha) arriving at a cliff where they plan to 

commit suicide due to the pressure put up by Ranjani's parents against their marriage. Sethu who 

is the son of an ordinary drunkard cook (Delhi Ganesh) and is also a dancer is not accepted as 

groom for Ranjani by her parents. The parents threaten Ranjani that either they would kill Sethu 

or commit suicide. While jumping from the cliff Sethu accidentally gets trapped in a tree and 

escapes but Ranjani dies. Despite the attempts made by Ranjani's father to jail Sethu by framing 

a fault case that Sethu killed Ranjani, no strong evidence was there to prove it. He is jailed 

for the offence of attempted suicide for one year.

After a year, he is released from jail. Padmini (Srividya) who owns a dance school provides him 

a job of dance master as he is the former student. Sethu visits regularly the cliff as a 

remembrance of his love. On his way he sees a girl (Revathi) who attempts suicide for silly 

reason of failure in examination and he stops her from it. He again meets the girl in a gallery. 

The girl introduces herself to him as Malini but he ignores her. Malini again meets Sethu at a 

tourist spot where she clicks photos without his knowledge but Sethu finds out and damages her 

camera. Malini chases him to his dance school as his student. Sethu repeatedly insults her but 

Malini develops a love for Sethu.
