imdb says its spanish language

,truthy,2012-08-10T10:41Z,"video: DivX 5 720x404 29.970 fps 1801 kbit no Qpel/GMC
audio: AC3 5.1 448 kbit 48 Khz

the language is original spanish. it has black bars on top & bottom & english subtitles hardsubbed (in these bars). the video seems slightly interlaced (Hybrid film/interlaced. Mostly film. Varying field order. TIVTC) however it's still better than all the other versions out there so far. the movie is quite entertaining in my opinion.

thx for sharing!"
