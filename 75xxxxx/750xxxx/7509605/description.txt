Source: VIDEO - Russian camrip and Kingdom THANKS
        AUDIO - Unknown line
Notes: Readnfo ......too let you know its badly cropped and there might be some
minor oos slips for a few secs here and there

Video was nice too start with and only main issue was the crop,which we can't do
nothing about that ...oh and it was missing the intro
So took the russian camrip and muxed the intro too the kingdom video.Also
filtered both videos differently The kingdom video is 99% of the movie ....and
the work on that was the normal contrast,brightness,chroma etc
Also slightly pulled the left side out a touch more ....also increased the
sharpness

Audio....now this is where all the time went doing this pita release lol
The audio because it was oos on unknowns in parts and also been cut etc....it was
hard to get it too sync
Normally you could stretch or shrink the audio too fit ,but non of that was
working FFS so had to do it the old fashion way and watch in and sync it as it
went along
The audio correction ranged frok -400 to + 200ms .....and i had parts that
lasted 13 secs and others lasting 7mins
In the end i made 36 cuts and got 99% of it syncd ....well i would say
Guessing there will be some slight minor slips but nothing major and defo not for
long anyway

Once done opted too clean the audio as it had some noise of a few of the eq
bands ...so lowered then down to hide it better and then resave and remuxed too
our encode

Anyway enjoy folks
