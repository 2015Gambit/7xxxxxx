Dark Alter Ego
THE GIANT is two instruments in one. A dark, cinematic alter ego, effectively a separate instrument alongside the main piano, offers an irresistible playground for sound design and dramatic effects.

Size matters - the original piano
The original instrument is the Klavins Piano Model 370i. The 'i' stands for integrated - this huge upright piano is built into the wall of a room, effectively securing the soundboard. Over three meters high and weighing over two tons, the Klavins Piano Model 370i provides a soundboard that's roughly twice the size of a typical 9' concert grand piano soundboard.
