,paul211b,2012-08-07T16:00Z,Please can someone tell me why the audio is rubbish stereo only. People giving his torrents A10 are crazy. A bluray rip needs 5 channel sound or what's the point?
,CakeMonster,2012-08-07T17:22Z,"Both video and Audio are great

But the story in the movie, is like wow how did they get such a massive budget for this?

At the end of the credits at 2.09.30 there is a suprise"
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T00:52Z,"The only movie that managed to confuse me on which to get pissed off at more, was The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games was a Sensational Turd that came out of Holly's A$$ in the form of a Baseball Bat on Credit Card to beat me in the Brain, insult my intelligence, and attempt to put me in debt by a Couple Hours of my Life, Time which I won't get back, and also 10s of Dollars in real Money. Even Downloading this, means I pay for an ISP, which sort of pays for this TURD which I would not pay Extra for.

SPOILER ALERT: Please Read anyway.
 Another American Turd. They should have just released directly to Torrent. Only Idiots with Money are going to pay for this. Weren't the Military excercises International? So USA Navy and Japan to the rescue of the whole world, which was in no real danger. Infact. Aliens seem Noble Race, more like Miners or Engineers. One Electric Shock and the Doofus Captain ""Kirk"" Opens fire. No Communication, Nothing. The Aliens then try to send a Signal that its a Trap, Human are Evil Species, but USA Navy single handedly Eliminates them. To Top it off, 50 cal rifle goes right through Alien Windows but they made it through our Atmosphere. Somehow they must have got some Gorilla Glass. They Come to Earth flying, then float around. They start destroying Bridges. WTF? Why? The Aliens are clearly NOT soldiers. They have Tools, they are worker Aliens. They are badly represented. Humans are the Evil ones. But since no Communication happened, its also the Alien's fault. Hell the USA will attack anything that moves. In USA, first Amendment is to Have a Gun and shoot anything that knocks on your door. So Aliens should have read the USA Constitution before coming. This movie is a sign of declining Civilization. Where People start making excuses such as ""This is Entertainment Only"", but one can tell a lot about you if you are entertained by Complete and Utter BULLS.H.!t. Those reviewers should be Strapped to a seat and made to watch this 10 times. Who are these people that get the OK to make this TURD? Where is District 9 Sequel? Even on Torrents this is the most popular movie. If you value your time, you will skip. If you don't value your time, then get the f'k off this planet. Good Luck USA. I give Hollywood another 10 years before India, China, and SouthAfrica's movie studios start sending you a Big F U in a Samsung BluRay HD 1080p. You stupid American idiots. Get off our Screens."

,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T23:56Z,"@ canopener: Ha, that's funny. I am quite disturbed aren't I? No man I am just a deeper level thinker. I'm glad you enjoy Hollywood Turds, to each his own. When something is really good, I don't argue about it. Have fun, take it easy."
,damouse1,2012-08-10T02:19Z,Movie isn't worth more bitrate than the standard YIFY encoding. Download one of those and bask in its awfulness while wasting less internet bandwidth. Save the tubes!
,Hein.Tal,2012-08-10T15:13Z,Download rate is terrible.
,TheGrouch123,2012-08-11T00:04Z,@ChillyCrossFoot Yes. Deeper level thinkers obviously feel the need to use words like 'turd'
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-11T01:19Z,"@TheGrouch123: Yes Indeed. Because the world TURD sounds a heck of a lot better than the commonly used word SHIT. Also, To add to your diminishing value of entertaining me with different user accounts, this movie is worthy of a PortaLoo, which is more than likely more hi-tech than the outhouse you are used to in the woods. Get a life you simpleton, and maybe post up couple of torrents before talking SHIT."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-11T01:20Z,Correction: World*=Word.
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-11T01:21Z,Ya like that? Ya like TURDS? You pay Postage and I'll send you plenty of Turds.
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-11T01:24Z,"Would you prefer the commonly coined word ""BATTLESHIT""? Keep it coming. The entertainment from lovers of Turds is definitely worth every second of my time, as opposed to this TURD of a movie."

""In USA, first Amendment is to Have a Gun and shoot anything that knocks on your door. So Aliens should have read the USA Constitution before coming.""

Before you try to seem intelligent enough to insult the US, maybe YOU should have read the Bill of Rights. "
,mmsandi,2012-08-12T09:59Z,"''Shoot someone when they come at your door in first amandment"" - that's why you americanos are so popular in the world. I can't seem to find a way to implement subtitles in this movie. They don't work in any player I tried."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-12T12:33Z,"@atroyer99: Seriously dude? Shoot someone who comes knocking at your door? Wasn't it the Doofus Kirk wannabe that knocked on the ALIEN door? And boy got buzzed. Aside from the fact he was in SALT Water, you know the Alien's could have had that big giant pyramid wannabe thing turned all the way upto ""Full Roast"" but they didn't. Kirk got himself a 9volt battery buzz and flipped out. Please don't tell me about the Amendment and Bill of Rights. You guys are getting your asses kicked all over the world so youre defending an excuse of a movie in which you fantasize destroying a peaceful alien race. Sure I exaggerated just a little bit when it comes to fact (second amendment) but hey, you all have made it your first by the looks of it. Anyway, I am not here to argue about this with boneheads anyway. I'd like to see anyone who argues with me send me a proof of purchase for this movie. Then I will award you Bonehead of the year award and I will admit that I am wrong at the same time."
,buck3th3ad,2012-08-13T03:13Z,i have to agree with ChillyCrossFoot his hypothesis that aliens were friendly ... if you care to notice that everything they targeted was green until it attacked them ... even then they only targeted command bridges to inflict the least of the casualties ... really nice observation chilly

 $302,836,260 (Worldwide) (4 August 2012),

Well maybe not only americans are retarded, a bit all over the world,

This movie is ridiculous,
Battleship with Teens, Rhiana saves the world!!
Its no good even for kids, as theres too much explosions,
Its a pitty that Liam Neeson was part of this, though for few minutes, only to attract me to watch it,
maybe we really should be destroyed by aliens"

,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-15T12:26Z,"@m00seknuckle: Did you have anything to do with landing a Rover on Mars? No. Someone else will eventually tell you what you need to hear, but good on you. I think the Rover is gonna run out of gas next year, so they are hiring people to bring gas to Mars for the Rover. Sign up Quickly Mooseknuckle, you'll get a a medal and smoke some commies on the way to Mars at the same time.
Liam Neeson - Shame on this man. He must've have developed some crack habit to want some extra bucks to get his snort on."
,Lebada3,2012-08-15T20:07Z,"Movie was completely retarded. I was watching it here and there, while working. 

Impossible to watch a movie like this and devoting your full attention. "
,Lebada3,2012-08-15T20:14Z,"@ Chilly and Liam Neeson comment. 
I think Liam Neeson either turned workaholic due to his wife death to keep him busy. Or maybe he is a big spender like Cage and needs to keep up with rent and other million dollar expenses. Either way there are maybe 1-2 good movies a year released by Hollywood ( even those are often decent at most )."
