,vali31,2012-08-04T10:26Z,"1,256 seeders and only able to connect to 13. 40 kb/s fucking weak."
,fademan,2012-08-04T13:39Z,Legit? Quality?
,Zipgun,2012-08-04T21:07Z,@.Leto.  Dude of course he has a supercar probably a garage full.  Testdrive or Testdrive 2 or Forza maybe? Not sure about Forza tho as I don't own a console. Also don't forget about Matchbox Hotwheels. LOL!
,.Leto.,2012-08-05T03:38Z,"Perfect A/V quality.
Even though the director is Peter Berg this totally feels like a Michael Bay movie. Too bad Berg couldn't copy Bay's success as well :D
But even if it didn't make that many $ it's still an entertaining movie with excellent CGI effects. And AC/DC's Thunderstruck still rocks!!
Thanks for the upload."

Another American Turd. They should have just released directly to Torrent. Only Idiots with Money are going to pay for this. Weren't the Military excercises International? So USA Navy and Japan to the rescue of the whole world, which was in no real danger. Infact. Aliens seem Noble Race, more like Miners or Engineers. One Electric Shock and the Doofus Captain ""Kirk"" Opens fire. No Communication, Nothing. The Aliens then try to send a Signal that its a Trap, Human are Evil Species, but USA Navy single handedly Eliminates them. To Top it off, 50 cal rifle goes right through Alien Windows but they made it through our Atmosphere. Somehow they must have got some Gorilla Glass. They Come to Earth flying, then float around. They start destroying Bridges. WTF? Why? The Aliens are clearly NOT soldiers. They have Tools, they are worker Aliens. They are badly represented. Humans are the Evil ones. But since no Communication happened, its also the Alien's fault. Hell the USA will attack anything that moves. In USA, first Amendment is to Have a Gun and shoot anything that knocks on your door. So Aliens should have read the USA Constitution before coming. This movie is a sign of declining Civilization. Where People start making excuses such as ""This is Entertainment Only"", but one can tell a lot about you if you are entertained by Complete and Utter BULLS.H.!t. Those reviewers should be Strapped to a seat and made to watch this 10 times. Who are these people that get the OK to make this TURD? Where is District 9 Sequel? Even on Torrents this is the most popular movie. If you value your time, you will skip. If you don't value your time, then get the f'k off this planet. Good Luck USA. I give Hollywood another 10 years before India, China, and SouthAfrica's movie studios start sending you a Big F U in a Samsung BluRay HD 1080p. You stupid American idiots. Get off our Screens."
,.Leto.,2012-08-10T22:11Z,"lol, chill out with the in-depth analysis, this movie was only meant to entertain you. Plus it totally failed at the box-office, so no great expectations here. Considering all that it wasn't that bad.
Unlike The hunger games which was a huge disappointement. That one really deserves to be flamed! "
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-12T12:26Z,"@Leto: Word! Ok I'll stop lol. But here's one just for you. WW2 Destroyer full of Ammo behind the ""Win a bunny for a dollar machine"" Come Git Sum Ya Lizards! "
