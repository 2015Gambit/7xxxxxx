That is torrent website. There is no way a movie or tv show/series to be in RAR form. Movie/tv show/series are few files and there is absolutely no point to rar these files. You can easily download files from file sharing websites where they are mostly in rar form, but wait that is torrent website. Again, there is no point to rar 1-4 movie/tv show/series files, unless you hide something. If that torrent was crack or something suspicious for the AV then I will agree to be .rar
And even worse that torrent is not only RAR but it is on rar chunks, some users will face huge issues with extracting all of them, another minus for this ""rar tv show"". I hardly laugh with all my voice when I saw that brainless made torrent honestly! Just combine the words: ""rar+tv show"" sounds like ""I jumped with no parachute from 1000ft mountain and survived"""
