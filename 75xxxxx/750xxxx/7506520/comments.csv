Instead of putting request, plz ensure whether the dvd is out or not. if available then put a link of the dvd availability.

for ur info, the dvd of ""Tell Me O Kkhuda"" is not available on any dvd selling site like amazon or flipkart. so its clear not available till now. DDR group generally put all movie wen they are out. its my experience, since the time i m downloading.
