,Lvobjectx,2012-08-07T22:57Z,I can't get Lucky Palms to show up on my neighborhood list in game for some reason. Has anyone else had this problem or does anyone else have a solution? Thanks :)
,dhod4ever,2012-08-08T08:14Z,"@Lvobjectx
Try using either the Gold or the Standard Edition of lucky palms (both is decrapified sims3packs).
Try troubleshooting it by installing and uninstall the lucky palms in the Sims 3 launcher."
,xboxuser11,2012-08-09T16:37Z,"Thanks for this biggggggg file!! just want to know something, I see other torrent but need some fix for the pack, but with this one, did I only have to put the pack 1.2.1 to install it without any fix?!
Thanks again!"
,dhod4ever,2012-08-10T19:02Z,"@xboxuser11 a
seems like rachel is kinda busy so i will answer your question.

every time the sims 3 had expansion pack or stuff pack, the base game version will update too. so in order to work our mods, we should update our mods.

every month rachel will upload a fully compatible sims 3 store items that eliminate conflicts with the new updates. in other words you dont need to apply fixes in this torrents.

from what I can remember
v1.1 fixes issues from pets expansion
v1.2 fixes issues and fully compatible in showtime expansion
v1.2.1 some items are being move to another package to eliminate issues like (loading issues, gaming conflicts, in game bugs, and display error)

NOTE: this is a complete set of items from 2009 til now thats why it range about 10GB of memory."
,8190,2012-08-11T07:13Z,is anyone else having problems using buy or build mode after installing these?
,BDSMers,2012-08-11T10:02Z,"Rachel you are a god, been using your stuff since forever and the misses swears by it and makes me search your latest release before its released even.
Puhleeze keep up the great work"
,Nagakaze,2012-08-12T00:26Z,"This is quality upload right here. About the store updates, though, should they all be applied or should we only extract the only the latest ones (v.1.2.1) to the packages folder?
"
,Nagakaze,2012-08-12T00:29Z,"Also, provided that I prefer Sims3packages to the packages, should I even extract them?"
,dhod4ever,2012-08-12T09:16Z,"@Nagakaze

I suggest you to remove your old stuff and use the newest .sims3packs and .packages, both have been updated to v1.2.1 
(They both can't exist except World and building) World and building are sim3packs and need to be install in sims 3 launcher.

If you have another mod items or sims 3 mod app. be sure to update that too. If conflicts still exist, try to remove the outdated items or apps. and wait for the update of that particular items or apps."
,xboxuser11,2012-08-13T14:07Z,"@dhod4ever
Thanks for your answer! a very very good torrent, so I put my game up to date, then I put all the 6-7 big .package file in the package directory, then just install the building and the neightbordhood via the luncher, that't right? when a 1.2.2 or anything else came out, I just kick off all the package and just replace it with the new one?! thanks again and sorry for my english!!"
,dhod4ever,2012-08-13T15:53Z,"@xboxuser11

There is a total of 38 .packages. from store update 1 (way back from 2009 items) to store update 38 (july 2012 items).

by the way if you will use the .package files,
use either (the 38 monthly package files) or (the 4 yearly package files) using both will result in duplicates items or game error.

Rachel will upload a store items every month. but i'm not sure when she will release a new version. I think she will release the v1.3 a week or 2 when the ""Sims 3 Supernatural"" goes on sale."
,xboxuser11,2012-08-13T17:28Z,"@dhod4ever
Exactly I have put in the package directory the 4 years bundle package files, not the 38 one .... "
,anon_349,2012-08-15T00:07Z,"Love your releases Rach.
I find myself looking for your releases first before I go and check the actual TS3 online store :D

Glad to see your no worst for wear after the tragic ending of DMD.
I almost cracked it when I heard the news and the first though that came to my mind was ""Oh no! rachel's store releases are on DMD :C ""
Thank god u had alternative plans.

If you do at some point stick to any P2P/torrent tracker. Please kindly notify us loyal RTB fans of urs ;)

Luv ya lots hun! *mwah!"
,hamalta,2012-08-15T11:02Z,"Thank you so much Rachel for this great work
and thank you dhod4ever for providing tech support :)"
,Morisatos,2012-08-21T14:17Z,"Rachel, one thing you can add/update for Store September 2012 update is to:

1. Remove the Buccaneer's Bounty Set from update 16 Sept. 2010.

2. Remove Barnacle Bay neighbourhood.

3. Replace with Complete Barnacle Bay Adventure! which includes the 2 new exclusive staircases (Barnacle Free Staircase + Jacob's Staircase)."
,Mikster19,2012-08-26T22:56Z,Would you mind Putting just the premium content into its own Folder
,Mikster19,2012-08-27T00:14Z,also missing some early male hairs
,yoashmo,2012-08-28T22:02Z,"thanks for these. also for being someone who realizes some people, like myself, prefer sims3pack.
but i just added everything from this pack.
i now realize in the launcher it comes up with the custom icon instead of the store one. which doesnt bother me bc in-game it shows the store icon.
the only problem i have is none of your content has the name of the item, when hovering in buy catalog in-game. 
is this part of the process when you decrapify?
if so i would prefer it be the other way, bc now i dont know what the items are called and i cant tell if im missing any items.
anywho i know rachel has health issues. so anyone who knows the answer lemme know."
