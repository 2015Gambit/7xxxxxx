,B.Torrents,2012-08-07T07:25Z,Thanks TvTeam...
,captaincritic,2012-08-08T05:11Z,i usually dont go for pov flicks. But probably because the first one I remember watching was blair witch project. just killed it for the rest. Been well over ten years so i think ill try this one out.it wont take me a decade to get over this one because its free.
,Org.Cherrybone,2012-08-11T23:10Z,A/V?
,sorasbestfriend,2012-08-11T23:50Z,"@captaincritic that's because they are relatively cheap, take paranormal activity for example it cost 15,000$ to make and they earned 200 million back...the things you can do with a nonprofessional camera

as for the movie i'd give it a solid 7 out of 10. great movie idd"
,Co6aka111,2012-08-18T01:00Z,"Where can I find English subtitles? Please, please, pleeeeaaaase !"

,JauffreBlumpkins,2012-08-28T08:23Z,Thanks for the upload but this movie sucks balls. 
,spifkitten99,2012-08-31T14:13Z,"Ripped and encoded by a moron.

Barely watchable. Constantly studdering framerate."
,Pdid,2012-08-31T19:00Z,It's real. Some comments people post here truly speak to the sliding intelligence of humanity.
,tpbfannn,2012-09-02T14:00Z,"Great quality,

but need english subtitles...please"
,DMNKLR,2012-09-05T01:32Z,"This movie was hyped to be so awesome.  I watched it, barely made it through, and realized I had wasted all kinds of hope on a royal piece of garbage.  The quality, generally speaking, is good (as far as say DVD/BDR/VOD HD goes), but oh my craphole was it ever a crap movie!  Want to punch these people in their throats for making such a huge load of crap.  Each part had such immense potential, and just when they start to get decent, it drops to worse than horse dung.  This particular upload is wonderful quality, as always for TvTeam, but the movie itself is horrible.  I'd watch Blair Witch again before this one."
,WolfCreed,2012-09-06T10:24Z,"@firestorming

NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION ON THE MOVIE! Just quality!

p.s. Thanks TvTeam....again! :-)"
