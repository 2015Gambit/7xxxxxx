One of the most unconventional albums ever recorded, this avant-garde psychedelic suite contains elements of folk, jazz, rock and electronica, but has a sound and atmosphere all of its own. Recorded in 1970, but barely released (despite the enthusiastic support of John Peel), original copies now sell for astronomical sums.
