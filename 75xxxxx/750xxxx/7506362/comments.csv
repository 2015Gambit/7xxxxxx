,TheEmpathicEar,2012-08-05T19:46Z,"Does this need to be activated? And, if so, will Windows Loader work for Windows 8 as well as Windows 7?"
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-05T19:56Z,This needs to be activated but there isn't a loader yet to activate it. I think it will be out in 1-2 week so unitill you can try it for 30days.
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-08-05T20:32Z,"Ok, thx. I think I will wait for a loader or something else before I invest myself in it."
,boscoboscowitz,2012-08-05T22:38Z,"What does WZT stand for? I have tried to find a definition, and I have failed."
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-05T23:25Z,WZT is a release group. nothing to do with windows 8.
,jonathan21,2012-08-06T05:36Z,thanks so much chris look forward to trying
,akb1ajay,2012-08-06T08:43Z,Would Win 7 software and drivers work with Windows 8. 
,extracube,2012-08-06T12:11Z,"@Chris-Aksel, re: ""you can try it for 30days.""

From what I understand is even if a loader or crack doesn't come out soon, you can still extend the 30 days again by using the command ""slmgr.vbs /rearm"" (without the quotes) in the command bar.  I've never used it so I don't know a) how long it will extend the system functionality, and b) how many times you can use it.  Anyone know?  Please tell us."
,future.computer,2012-08-06T16:00Z,thx man but I have small question ! yesterday I installed windows  8 enterprise non n I mean it's have windows media player so whet the different ?  between this and between enterprise ?
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-06T18:11Z,"Until some activating bypass thingy comes along you could always just rearm

1. regedit HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionSoftwareProtectionPlatform and change the value for SkipRearm to 1
2. run ""slmgr -rearm"" (note! this will also reset the above mentined value to zero again)
3. Now the 30 day activating time is reset to 0 once more (You can only do this reset 7 times)"
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-06T18:13Z,Windows 7 drivers dont go to windows 8. ati & nvidia released they graphic drivers for windows 8 for others dont know yet.
,topjimmy68,2012-08-06T23:26Z,"Found this in the comments of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7500071/WINDOWS_8_ENTERPRISE-N_RTM_X64_VOLUME_ENGLISH_BOOT_DVD_%5BThumperD

Open command promt as admin
If you are using Pro, type these lines ONE BY ONE!
slmgr -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato

If you are using Enterprise:
slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr /ato
slmgr /dli

For me, activation details shows ""Your license to use Windows expires on 2/2/2013""
Plenty of time for now, if this holds up."

So for the sake of not annoying people, please do not post any ""this is how i did it"" posts until you can confirm that the server is back online, or a new server is known."
