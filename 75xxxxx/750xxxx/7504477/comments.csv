,trini_bankai,2012-08-05T00:03Z,Currently downloading. Will comment on quality as soon as its finished but seeing as its a publichd rip I'm assuming its the best! :)
,Oblivilot,2012-08-05T00:14Z,"Hey there, thanks BOZX! Ignore all those fools who moan and complain - yet see fit to upload NOTHING. As far as that prior bad 720p skipping upload, who cares - Technical glitches occur, it's par for the course. Cheers!"
,bmdj1992,2012-08-05T00:59Z,"Thanks man, hope this isn't the repeating version."
,Therealvamp,2012-08-05T01:47Z,thank you as always BOZX ;)
,suji123,2012-08-05T02:47Z,seeds pls..................
,Sonicblade008,2012-08-05T03:02Z,Does this one repeat?
,alangfp,2012-08-05T03:50Z,has anyone checked it??
,Sonicblade008,2012-08-05T04:29Z,"The time stamp for his 720p re-rip is before this one, so I would assume this is a fixed version. 

PLEASE SEED THOUGH!!!"
,FireIsHot,2012-08-05T07:02Z,"People realize they should download this or the 720p re-rip. Not that stuff that's floating around, there's even 3 [Cocaine] re-rips that have the same error as the original 720, simply brilliant.

I can't say for sure, but the running time for this is identical to the 720 re-rip, so it shouldn't have the repeated scene.

Also BitTorrent is showing 929 seeders. while TPB is showing 162. And I'm only able to connect to 5 max, 1 lowest, which is strange..

My upload and download ratio is nearly 70% after 6 hrs of downloading I'm at 15.6% with Max Bandwidth Allocation on. Running 5.4 mbps without BT running, With BT running it's .80 mbps

Yet my max download speed is averaging less than 300kbps, can someone explain this to me? Clearly BT is sucking all my speed, yet the torrent won't reflect it, even with low seeders I should be able to be pulling much more.

I'm using a Netgear N Router and ATT DSL."
,Venturai,2012-08-05T15:28Z,"No repeating in this one guys. Just watched in my home theatre room.

Day one purchase for me when the Blu-ray's released in a couple of weeks."

,FireIsHot,2012-08-05T23:09Z,"Subs, for this rip, work a better than the 720p rip subs for this release, sounds crazy I know, but try them out yourself if you don't believe me.

,cascade042,2012-08-11T14:34Z,Thanks to you BOZX by the way for providing us with this torrent! Much appreciated!
,FireIsHot,2012-08-18T04:34Z,"A/V: 10/10 - Simply amazing for the size.

M: 8/10 - Well Done, had it's flaws. I read the books btw.

Watched on my 40' 1080p LCD by TCL.

Thanks for the upload so soon, the download a couple weeks ago was a little slow and took most of the night before it picked up steam.

I am also downloading the 720p re-rip, which I wish more people would seed instead of the original. I have no doubt it'll be awesome as well.

Thanks!"
