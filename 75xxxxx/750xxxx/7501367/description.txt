 This was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Box Set DVD Collection.
Season 4 just came out July 17th,2012 on DVD (which I have yet to get my hands on),so I'll post DL link when I upload it.
*** Episodes 6 & 8 of Season 1 -unfortunately- had to be encoded from HDTV due to the available disc with those episodes having been scratched,ruining my rips of those two.As soon as I can (which will be when I get Season 4 DVDs), I will repack and upload for those who want purity of their downloads ;p *** 
Pease SEED as you DL so others may also enjoy the movie!
