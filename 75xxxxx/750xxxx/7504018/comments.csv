Step Up Revolution 2012 CAM x264 AC3 - KiNGDOM

then it would be watchable.  Unfortunately, it's like a camera only half focused.  Or like you're watching it thru one of those windows that has that opaque tinting on it (like fogged over) to help protect people from completely seeing through it.  Audio is decent, but pic is horrible. "
