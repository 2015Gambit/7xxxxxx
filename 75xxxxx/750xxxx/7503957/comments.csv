,SuperSonet,2012-08-19T23:09Z,"There is a problem with the ""roboform-x64.dll"" file.  It crashes IE 64.  I tried several other downloads and the same problem exists with all of them.  Apparently there is a bad dll file floating around.  Finally had to use original roboform dll to make IE 64 work."
,logrussr,2012-08-31T03:09Z,Works fine. Thanks
,Heartofthorns,2012-08-31T03:50Z,"Works fine, thanks.
Though the original icons for different stuff, for example Roboform Editor/Taskbar Icon etc have changed to the default windows icon and original icons are not available. When I tried to change the icons, it said roboform.dll contains no icons.
Well, that's just presentation-wise. The application works totally fine though. Thanks once again!"
