Lyrics: 

 YouΓÇÖre far away, so far away
 Have to believe that you can still feel me
 And I can only wait and miss you
 Now weΓÇÖre locked in time, out on the wire
 I wish that I could fight the world for you
 IΓÇÖm always on your side
 If I could trade places, you know I would

 Hold on
 DonΓÇÖt let go
 Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
 YouΓÇÖre not alone in the dark, can you see me

 Cos IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

 IΓÇÖll never leave, you know I wonΓÇÖt
 I feel youΓÇÖre close, youΓÇÖre coming back to me
 And summer may be over
 But she leaves you her song

 Hold on
 DonΓÇÖt let go
 Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
 YouΓÇÖre not alone in the dark, can you see me

 Cos IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

 IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖll be lighting fires

 Oh whoa

 Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
 YouΓÇÖre not alone in the dark, can you see me

 Cos IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you
 IΓÇÖll be lighting fires, fires, for you

 IΓÇÖm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

 Thanks
