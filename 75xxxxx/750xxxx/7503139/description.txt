Episode 2 : Massacre at Columbine High 

This is a captivating, minute-by-minute account of the Columbine High School massacre that horrified the world.

At 11.08 on Tuesday 20 April 1999, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, students in Littleton, Colorado, approached their school and just one hour later, they lay dead having taken their own lives after killing 12 fellow pupils, one teacher and seriously injuring 23 others.

Featuring chilling video footage of Klebold and Harris this programme offers a real insight into the twisted minds that devised a devastating plan too horrific to believe and then carried it out with cruel and fanatic precision.

Was this massacre a sign of sickness in today's society which could possibly reoccur, or was it an extraordinary and unlikely to be repeated combination of character, background and psychology that erupted with devastating consequences?

Beyond exploring the root of the incident, this programme also tells many stories of selfless bravery in the face of a terrifying situation.
