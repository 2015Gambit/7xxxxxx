,agurkai3,2012-08-06T15:14Z,"Tryed... when even clicking exe Geting error: Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.

I think its virus. Cause defender enebles and scans something.

,.HuNtEr.,2012-08-07T14:25Z,"First try to read the title it purely saying its for 
Windows 8 Build 7850
"
,demis1159,2012-08-07T18:35Z,WORKS 100% OR NOT ?
,.HuNtEr.,2012-08-07T19:50Z,works 100% on Build 7850
,xpmule,2012-08-07T22:46Z,"Why are you trying to twist around what I said when your the one that said its for the RTM/Final the times in a row in the first part of your description ?

You are being misleading to say the least and are playing games galore here and TONS of people need a straight answer they don't need their questions ignored while you state the obvious with some attitude. WTF is your problem ?

If i was in charge here your torrent would have already been deleted.

Personaly i couldn't care less about windows 8 but i hate seeing people waste their time and effort download crap at TPB for no reason.

How about drop the fucking attitude and answer all the people who lkeep asking you if this works for Windows 8 RTM / Final ?
You said it did in your description MANY times in case you forgot..

Based on this and some of your other torrents i have 0 trust in you.
The other one a uTorrent speed up tool you failed to mention it will install a toolbar on peoples computers. So god knows what you get lol

I'll be avoiding your files for sure..."
,.HuNtEr.,2012-08-08T03:11Z,"I had putted the title not for fun.

Read then Fu*k.

If you don't want , go away ////////////////"

This one is for developer preview."
