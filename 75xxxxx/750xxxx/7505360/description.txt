The eccentric Julie Harris as Sally Bowles, mistress of decadent Berlin? Impossible, you say. Well see...

A lot of people on the net have been complaining that this movie is unavailable - well, here it is. This movie is not Cabaret any more than Pygmalion (1938) is My Fair Lady - it deserves to be appreciated on its own merits. Did I mention My Far Lady? Malcolm Arnold's score to this movie somewhat resembles it.

Julie Harris has the time of her life romping through the scenes, much of it at the expense of the hapless Harvey. This British version emphasizes whimsical humour, with less attention paid to the darker aspects. Julie Harris is gaining a cult following, devotees definitely should have this in their collection.
