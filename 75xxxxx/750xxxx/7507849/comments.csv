,5p1n47,2012-08-06T06:27Z,not that I got anything against Public or nothin.....but his uploads are always 2gb....ridiculous when 550mb is HD enough for me
,nimd4,2012-08-06T06:34Z,"@ wldrayton it's not about 'a trusted source' lol, it's that the episode just aired (always check the schedules :))"
,Gam3OveR,2012-08-06T06:44Z,Thankyou Zyzz bird in advance
,.Leto.,2012-08-06T06:59Z,"@ 5p1n47: There's nothing ridiculous about a 2GB filesize. If you're still watching this on some lame 19"" crt that's your problem. But some of us have 22,24"" monitors. If you had one you'd realize that very small releases like this one are too blurry when watched fullscreen."
