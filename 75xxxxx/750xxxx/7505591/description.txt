"Robinson in Space is a study of England's economic and cultural geography suggested by Daniel Defoe's Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain, in which an unseen 'researcher' Robinson is commissioned by 'a well-known international advertising agency' to undertake a study of the 'problem' of England. It is not stated in the film what this problem is, but there are images of Eton, Oxford and Cambridge, some ports and a lot of factories, and a few references to sex."

This film is No 52 in Time Out's 1000 Best British Films.
