Step into the world of Animal Crossing, where villagers live their 
everyday lives in time with an actual 24-hour clock. To become a 
part of the thriving village community, you'll get a job, buy a 
house and interact with other villagers, some of which can be 
controlled by friends and family. This Animal Crossing does not 
include a GameCube Memory Card.
