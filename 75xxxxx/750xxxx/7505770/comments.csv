Its because your security sees patches as a virus but its not."
,LissieP,2012-08-11T18:31Z,"I'll admit, I was worried because I was getting ""Caution"" errors all over the place when I was opening this, however I've used many patches before and never had an issue.
Just open up the patcher, click 'patch' and you're good to go. No viruses or anything on my end, I promise :)

Well done, and Thank-you!"
