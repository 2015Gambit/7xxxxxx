,Espana25,2012-08-05T21:22Z,Nice upload! but what is the source for these liveries ? MCPHAT or some other similar sort of painting studio or just a complete bunch of series available the PMDG site ? i would love to download but from where do these belong to ? 
,menelado,2012-08-06T09:04Z,"Good job!! Thanks,"
,Cden46,2012-08-10T17:47Z,Are these the same liveries from the PMDG site and if so why post something that's already for free
,HyprDrve,2012-08-11T12:20Z,"Yes these are available for free from the website and that is where i got it from, I just wanted to have the liveries in one pack for everyone to use instead of downloading each and every one."
