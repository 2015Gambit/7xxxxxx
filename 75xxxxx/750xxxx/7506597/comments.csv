,aarque,2012-08-07T13:05Z,"Did you make seasonal variations? FSX recognizes 5, although you could probably skip ""Hard Winter"" for India scenery. Night? To make night tiles you have to edit the photo images to make them darker, then add bright spots to represent lights. Then of course there is the autogen, which makes all that flat photo scenery have some ""depth."" Did you put all that in your photoreal scenery? Of course you did, just like you used the ""clone stamp tool"" to fill in the scenery where the sat image was missing - oh and .bgls cant be decompiled so it can't even be fixed - unless you supplied the source - which one could just as easily get from Google Earth server - which leads one to ask, what have you brought us and wouldn't it be better shared at an enthusiast site like Avsim, rather than at a pirating site like TPB? The question is rhetorical."
,sidx91,2012-08-07T21:18Z,"aarque- i think u are defintly right at this... since this was my newest upload and am not very well aware of avsim... so i thought i'd just put up here..
yeah i can create seasonal sessions as well as night textures"
