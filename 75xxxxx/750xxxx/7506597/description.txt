Hey Guys,
Here is my photoreal scenery of Delhi[VIDP](INDIA) covering 20 nm x 19 nm area around the airport..

Anyone who sees white tiles is due to low satelite coverage around few parts..



Here is the screen shot



Installation- Simply place in addon scenery folder and add from scenery library in FSX.

Thanks for using
