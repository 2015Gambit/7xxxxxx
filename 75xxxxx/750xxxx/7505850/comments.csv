Also 4.21 public keys will be released so all games can be patched.

Boobsman will be busy uploading.

[V],boobsman,2012-08-05T23:22Z,"I don't mind uploading the games as long as there's a demand n im not stuck seeding forever, got a new seedbox coming next week too so i'll easily have enough to take on the extra loads ;)"
,Clownman1,2012-08-05T23:32Z,"Thanks man! If you didnt know, the ps3 is region free, so even jap games can be good:)"
[V],boobsman,2012-08-06T00:40Z,"@ Clownman1 yep i know, i used to post PS3 games before but stopped when my console died :("
