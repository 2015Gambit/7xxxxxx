,BluWolve,2012-08-06T11:11Z,"I don't know what you mean, I have downloaded many many files from xCrazy0328x and have never once seen a .rar file. I can play the mp4 file as soon I start downloading so perhaps it is a problem on your end?"
,BluWolve,2012-08-06T11:33Z,"Excellent again, keep up the good work."

PS Thanks for putting it in MP4 format. Much appreciated. n_n"
