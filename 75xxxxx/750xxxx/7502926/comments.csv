Whereas Quality is concerned No Doubt About It When It Comes From You!!!"
,888ewc888,2012-08-04T12:45Z,"Dear YIFY, if that is your real name, I would eagerly like to know what software you use to rip/convert movies and the settings.  I note your movies are significantly lower in size than equivalent from others.  Please have mercy on me, I am just an 80yr old village idiot with my first TRS-80 computer trying to copy my old eight track DVD collection to fancy electronic files for my personal viewing. "
,param436,2012-08-04T12:49Z,seeding so slow.. all fukin indians are only leeching and not seeding as always. typical indians
,Mac Genius,2012-08-04T13:22Z,"@schok101
Yes, Yify will upload a 1080p

@888ewc888
I doubt Yify'll give out the settings, may be you can name your collection if we all are lucky, Yify will provide to the world"

,Gacy8Gein,2012-08-04T17:18Z,"This has the repeat scenes that start just after the 30mins mark.

Same as all the other rips based on the BLOW release."
,shenomega,2012-08-04T17:28Z,"I just recently watched it and it does have repeat scenes, at first I thought maybe it was a part of the movie but it happen again out of nowhere.. so I'm guessing that's the only flaw in this."
,markado1983,2012-08-04T18:13Z,thanks bro.. will seed for days.
,hotslized,2012-08-04T18:23Z,"Finally, thnks YIFY!"

,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-04T19:08Z,"If this actually was ripped from the Blu-Ray, why would it have repeat scenes like that? Just curious. Thanks YiFY for all you do."
,pinel,2012-08-04T19:10Z,"scenes keep repeating at random... nuked and confusing as hell

quality is great but random scenes are out of order and repeat over and over and over"

,nekroto,2012-08-04T20:35Z,"please do a rerip YIFY
i have been waiting for this movie for so long
I wanna watch a perfect release."
,Kanzakii,2012-08-04T20:54Z,"You'll probably want to wait before you download this torrent because of the scenes that keep repeating after the 30mn mark. 

Same with the subtitle files. You can't use them because of that.

Hope we'll get a re-rip tonight"
,bmdj1992,2012-08-04T21:02Z,"Please rerip, not using the source that every other idiot keep reuploading."
,dtanfay,2012-08-04T22:16Z,"Hi, can you plz do another encode using HDChina as source."

,dkwon,2012-08-05T00:26Z,Now that everyone knows there are repeating scenes Im sure yify and others will be editing and rereleasing very soon. jeez guys why is everyone such a dick?
,teancumwarrior,2012-08-05T01:07Z,I LOVE YOU YIFY!!!!! But I'm not gay brother! Just I love your sacrifice to make people like me happy!!!! 
,hansu,2012-08-05T03:10Z,"There's only 1 scene which is repeated like 3 or 4 times. Great movie, good rip - as always. Thanks YIFI"
,icenlordz,2012-08-05T03:44Z,"okay yea, the scenes are out of sync, i dont know why, strange for a yify torrent, never had a problem from them before"
,Mac Genius,2012-08-05T03:46Z,"@all, Yify has stated on page one, that this source is blow, hold your horses if you want him to upload the non-repeat scenes rip, once Yify does."
,KevvzHDD,2012-08-05T03:56Z,comments on YIFY and other releases said that they have repeated scenes.... I'm just gonna wait for a re-rip so I can watch this properly :D Thanks for the release YIFY! 
,britneyspearsisevil1,2012-08-05T07:57Z,"Wow, what great quality! Although, there is a repetitive part between 20 - 30 minutes, so please re-rip."
,Symn,2012-08-05T11:49Z,hmmm... 6000 seeders and i can only get a 130kbps bitrate?? wtf...
,harish7u,2012-08-05T11:55Z,Yify Could you please do a reRip. Thanks in advance.
,xtheghost,2012-08-05T12:42Z,"Alright after watching this from start to finish, there is in deed repeat scenes. (I counted at least 3 different repeats, usually only about a minute or two.) Not sure how this happened. 

Hopefully someone will re-edit the rip or do a completely new rip soon."
,alveolate,2012-08-05T13:17Z,"just weighing in. i'm currently at the 1h mark and ALREADY i have seen that darned ""repeated chapter"" 3 times. so far all 3x it's been that part where Katniss first talks to Cinna: ""showing you off to the people.""

it's VERY annoying, but the show's still quite watchable (thus far). just be warned that when Cinna reappears on screen, he might just be a repeat.

first YIFY rip i've seen that has a muck up thus far!"
,Raghav09,2012-08-05T15:42Z,"just wasted my 900mb downloading this shit...
DON'T DOWN THIS SHIT...scenes keep on repeting like crazy..."
,chaitanya89,2012-08-05T16:06Z,"@Raghav09

hey man! you're not the first person that noticed that this file has repeated scenes. You're getting this stuff for free and yet you complain about the glitches that happen rarely. be bit appreciative and supportive if possible.

Thanks for the great work YIFY."
,safta420,2012-08-05T21:27Z,"@ chaitanya89 Who cares if it's free. It should still be done correctly. Since YIFY only does reencodes of other groups works it should be very easy to glance through a movie to see if it's correct before reencoding it. Rerips have been out over a day now, so don't know why anyone would wait for YIFY to do another."

,Dave8986,2012-08-06T00:29Z,"The quality of this one is WAY better than the MaxSpeed one. This release is 902MB and MaxSpeed is 1.3 GB. It does have the skipping issue, but wait another week for excellent 1080p BRRIPS!!!!!!!!!"

If so i would just download the 1080p hopefully someone would answer

Thank you very much yify!"

Shut the fuck up man.. U'll know better if u have limited bandwidth..."
,hicutie,2012-08-06T11:14Z,Will u post a re rip version of this?
,s33rial,2012-08-06T15:16Z,Yify rips are terrible. Please stop seeding this garbage and seed decent quality rips instead.
,aumnik,2012-08-06T17:22Z,"subtitles for 1080p and not for 720p
why Yify?

,icenlordz,2012-08-06T19:25Z,"idk how u can say yify rips are garbage, i play his 720 rips through my ps3 onto a sony bravia 55"" and it looks better than any rips "

,Dig1taL,2012-08-09T00:52Z,@paul211b you want movies in small sizes at 720p you have to make some sacrifices to video and audio quality. He does this for us. If you want high definition audio go download a 4GB version.
,MorbidTish,2012-08-19T11:42Z,"I'd read the comments about the repeated scenes but forgot all about it & downloaded anyway.  I'm an hour in & they're getting pretty annoying lol.  Otherwise, excellent quality as always & definitely watchable.  Thanks so much for your hard work & ups YIFY, but would be great if you could re-up this one with a fix!"
,Mathafacka,2012-08-30T23:27Z,God dammit. Never downloading YIFI again. Seriously can't you even check if the time has changed from the source? Pathetic. Do not download this if you want to enjoy the movie.
,bfc2012,2012-09-17T16:07Z,"the re-rip is out there, if you're looking for 720p under 1gb, try this one:

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7507997/The.Hunger.Games.2012.RERIP.720p.Bluray.x264.anoXmous

most of you understand that yify can only encode with what is provided, but to those who are complaining, you should really shut the fuck up. yify has provided HUNDREDS of movies in top quality and makes a mistake about once a year, which is perfectly acceptable. stop being ungrateful.... again, most of you understand this, but some of you idiots really need to shut up...."
