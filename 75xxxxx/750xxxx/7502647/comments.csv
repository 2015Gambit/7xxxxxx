,missworld,2012-08-06T14:25Z,VLC PLAYER you fucking morons!! How do people still not know this or have half a brain to even google it! Bury the beds!
,TaZeRz,2012-08-08T01:51Z,"There not fucking morons the sound is screwed up using a different codec then every release on the scene which works just fine in mpc-hc and mxplayer on android, this does not.  

You shouldnt need vlc player unless its using non standard codecs like this is."
,TaZeRz,2012-08-08T02:01Z,Correction works fine in mpc-hc but I cant get the sound working on my android in mxplayer never had this issue with any other file.
,TaZeRz,2012-08-08T04:05Z,I found a solution people download the program Handbrake place the file as source and under audio change it from AAC to MP3 then enter a destination and hit re-encode and the sound works on all players including android.
