Remember, over 21 living in the USA, you too can buy a 1851, 1860, 1858, etc. model blackpowder revolver with an  effective range of 75m from Cabelas for less than $300ea and have some fun this summer.  Never know when a 30 gr, .44cal is gonna come in handy.  Wanna a real bang, try 60gr .44cal in a 1847 Walker Uberti revolver, its a blast!"
