Movie - nothing great, some very god acting and effects but there is nothing new in the story and it feels like a young adult novel turned into a young adult movie which it is.  A friends 10 year old daughter read all the books and said they were great.  So right there I knew it wasn't meant for an adult audience.  I found The Condemned to be a much grittier/believable/adult film with the same general idea.
