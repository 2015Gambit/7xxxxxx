,N00DL35,2012-08-19T18:44Z,"I didn't have high hopes for a camcorded movie, but this really set that bar so much lower.  I downloaded 21 Jump Street a few months ago, and the quality honestly wasn't bad at all.  This was just really bad.  Quick download, though."
,shdwplay,2012-08-25T20:58Z,"hahaha, I kinda like this quality, makes me feel like I'm watching a B rated movie on VHS again."
,lizardomanson,2012-08-31T15:46Z,"No one care if you liked or not the movie, just comment about the quality."
