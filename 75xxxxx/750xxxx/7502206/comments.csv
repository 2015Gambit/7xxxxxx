,MuffinManxD,2012-08-04T22:29Z,Must be the biggest torrent on TPB
,sckiller,2012-08-05T22:46Z,Greatly Appreciated. Will seed for awhile once done as well as much as I can while dl'ing this big old file. Cheers.
,sats1969,2012-08-09T13:38Z,wow!!!we probably all grow huge bears until we complete this one!!!
,sats1969,2012-08-09T13:41Z,i meant huge beards!!!
,sats1969,2012-08-09T19:08Z,"gsdhunt,whats the deal?we are a bunch of people stuck at 3,5-3,6% and no seeding...."
,sats1969,2012-08-09T19:49Z,"uploader,do we have to wait,or we must quit and leave?is the torrent alive?"
,sats1969,2012-08-09T20:04Z,"i cant believe that someone makes such an effort to upload 441 giga and then doesnt give  a fuck about it.i take it from your non-responce uploader,that the torrent is dead.

there are not 3 seeders as shown above...the truth is right here..."
,gsdhund,2012-08-12T17:00Z,"I'm seeding as best I can. It's very important to me that this gets out there for everyone.

As stated, my internet is spotty. If you don't like it, then don't bother downloading it.

I'm seeing *zero* pay for doing all this work, so pointless non stop whining really gets on my nerves fast. All i'm collecting is ""Karma"" for giving back something....

I do the best I can to get it pushed out there. So far 22.1 gigs has been uploaded

Unless someone is going to gift a seedbox or whatever, everyone can just deal with it.

Past this point, I will ignore any and all agenda laden ""wahhh, me not getting this in 2.5 nansoecond download speeds!""

If you can not have patience, then you really have no business even existing in life.

You are more then free to take your complaints, park them where the sun doesn't shine, and try to do all the work yourself. Understood?"
,sats1969,2012-08-13T18:53Z,"you are offensive mister,go fuck yourshelf and your touchy connection.."
,gsdhund,2012-08-17T03:32Z,"I'll be seeding this again, had some issues with my seed machine but it appears to be working better now.

sats1969: get the fuck off my torrent. you are lucky I don't know your ip address, would block your ass so quick.

To the trolls: Go away. I do not tolerate your kind, unless you pay me $950,000 canadian per kb, go to hell!"
,sats1969,2012-08-17T10:28Z,"first you say to me i have no business in life cause i dont have patience,i reply to you equally offensiveley,and then you threaten to kick me out if you knew my ip adress..who do you think you are mister?your torrent?by the time you upload something,it belongs to the community,not you.
you cant threaten me you piece of shit,so dont escalate this to another level.finally,i say again,you cant upload such a huge file with so small upload capabilities.the end."
,gsdhund,2012-08-17T23:23Z,"Having some upload problems currently, please have patience folks (I know some of you can)

As for Trolls, remember this.

MY WORD IS THE ONLY WORD ALLOWED, CASE CLOSED.

No wonder why I think this planet is a steaming cess pool of shit. You do something nice for people, Free even, and they think they still have rights to bitch, whine, moan and complain

YOU DON'T

Kindly step in front of a bus and get rid of yourself if you can not practice basic common sense, common law, etc etc"
,sats1969,2012-08-18T09:58Z,"be careful what you wish mothefucker(literally),you will probably get it.
if i had you in front of me ,i would kill you motherfucker.i said what i said to you,but i didnt  wish you dead,now i want it,vey much so.
so,shut the fuck up and die.you worthless,moron,no good,piece of crap."
,sats1969,2012-08-18T10:20Z,"i will not continue this,no matter what insult you bring to me,you simply not worth it...goodbye..."
,gsdhund,2012-08-21T07:30Z,"Torrent Abandoned, Can't Delete

Look for this collection in smaller parts (by season/movies) versus a huge chunk on here
