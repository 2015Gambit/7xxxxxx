Well here it is folks! This took quite a ton of work, and now it's ready for prime time!

The ultra ultra rarecollectors edition of the X-Files! Seasons 1-9, and the Movie Fight The Future.

Why pay inflated (downright illegal, to me) prices for it? This set suffers from immense technical issues i've found. Disc Rot that reduces down to just empty drink coasters and the like...

None of that here! You also won't have to pay inflated prices such as $850 just because it's out of production!

Please enjoy and seed seed seed!
