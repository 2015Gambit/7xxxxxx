The Rolling Stones
ΓÇ£Bedspring Symphony (A Box Lunch and Meat Whistle) Live in ConcertΓÇ¥
Limited Edition from the original TAKAL 1941
Silver CD>WAV (EAC)>FLAC


Quote from ΓÇ£Hot WacksΓÇ¥
ΓÇ£The best Stones live recording, surpasses even the officially released live albums in 
qualityΓÇ¥


This comes directly from the silver CD.  This is the best mixed 
of the 1973 soundboard shows (yes, better even then the great Rattlesnake release 
ΓÇ£Definitive BrusselsΓÇ¥).  Oh yeah, and one of the worst introductions of the Stones ever, 
lol.  Enjoy!
