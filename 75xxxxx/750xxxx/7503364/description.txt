This here's an audio file of the commentary by director Robert Mulligan & producer Alan J. Pakula for their collaborative masterpiece: To Kill A Mockingbird (1962). 

I could've uploaded the entire movie along with the commentary but owing to I having a limited bandwidth & my assumption that everybody owns a copy of the movie, I'm doing this.

It's an MPEG-4 AAC audio file (2 hours 9 minutes 12 seconds) which has been ripped from a R1-US-DVD9.

All you have to do is mux this audio file with your own copy of the movie which better be a decent BluRay Rip or DVD Rip to allow proper audio sync.

And seed as much as you can.

Enjoy!!!
