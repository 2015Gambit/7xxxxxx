,coleix,2012-08-11T17:45Z,"I was thinking of going through the old seasons and the old show so I can see all the doctors but I tried looking for the first 1963 season and couldn't find it. Thanks for the youtube search lol, next season looks great too."
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-08-16T02:41Z,"@coleix iTunes has a lot of the old episodes. Netflix also has a lot of them available to stream. Torrents are hard to come by for older stuff, unfortunately."
