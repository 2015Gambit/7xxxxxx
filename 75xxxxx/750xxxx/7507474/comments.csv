,MAURO8311,2012-08-11T17:27Z,amigos el MW3 si funciona para la 3.55 solo teneis k buscar el fix... probado por mi con la ultima version del multiman 4.04...
,1bad966spdz,2012-08-12T05:53Z,Why in the world isn't anyone posting the games with the fixes already to the new 3.60's and etc? And this torrent I have been sitting at 63.1-63.3% for a few days now.. Why go through the trouble of  posting this if NOT going to SEED or to observe it afterwards?? wow .. a waste of time for 128 leechers and counting..

BUT

Some info

This is a TB patched release (I think)

In order to get it working on just 3.55 - I did have to obtain the original eboot (and two other files) and the Duplex 3.55 fix and apply them in order.

This is NOT a clean release ready to be patched. Also, I have no idea why the sizes for the releases on TPB are so different."
