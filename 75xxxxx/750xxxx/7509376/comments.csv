,sergio786,2012-08-06T23:41Z,"Thanks alot for the torrent, really appreciate your hard work. Do you know when the links to filehosting site will be availabe for ex rapidshare, mediafire etc. "
,rawpulse,2012-08-07T00:06Z,"Some of them should still work from here (http://forum.warez.ag/tutorials/15767675-%5Brs%5D-%5Bavi%5D-beachbody-sagi-kalev-body-beast-workout.html) if you can be bothered to go through and get them individually (if you don't have premium accounts the speeds are atrocious and some are premium only). FiftyPence was generous enough to provide Rapidshare, Netload and Filefactory mirrors for each file.

Please remember to seed if you download this torrent."

,rawpulse,2012-08-13T19:05Z,"@igodspeed: Thanks for spamming comments and calling me a ""looser"" for not having the book. If you're so desperate then your cheap ass can go out and buy the program instead of spamming random links on here you cock riding shit stain.

@Everyone else: You're all welcome. I'll continue to seed for the next few weeks and will hopefully have the book as soon as it's scanned by someone."
,canewill,2012-08-14T01:04Z,"rawpulse,

Thanks a million and looking foward for the book. "

Looks like we have a few typos in the Book of Beast, largely centering around the carbs and proteins in our Fuel Shot and Base Shake supplements.

While these mistakes may seem substantial, they’re not. The Body Beast Nutrition Plan features thousands of calories. When building mass, a smart, high caloric plan like this basically guarantees you are getting all the protein, carbs, and fat you need, so slight shifts in those macronutrients shouldn’t have an impact. Basically, we’re talking changes along the lines of an egg white worth of protein or a couple grapes of carbs at the most. You’ll get big and stay healthy regardless of shifts that minor.

That said, we want to give you the best possible product for your investment. Furthermore, we know that many of you like to take a hands-on approach to the math aspect of your diet, so we want you to have the most accurate numbers to do that.

Page 71 –

For the recovery recipes, make that ONE scoop of Fuel Shot to one scoop of Base Shake (instead of 2:1).

You may notice that this creates a ratio slightly below the 3:1 protein:carbs we mention earlier on the page. This is okay for two reasons. First, ease-of use. This balanced combination is easy to mix and, if you’re using these two supplements solely as a recovery aid, this recipe will make both tubs a one-month supply.

Second, both Fuel Shot and Base Shake are unflavored. While drinking them alone is effective nutrition, it’s not as delicious as, say, Beachbody Results & Recovery Formula, so we’re assuming you’ll want to flavor your Body Beast postworkout drink with something from the liquid carbs list. By keeping the initial ratio low, we’ve given you much more flexibility with your flavoring options.

Page 74 –

Under BEACHBODY HARDCORE BASE SHAKE:

Each serving (1 scoop) has 18 grams of whey protein and 9 grams of maltodextrin + dextrose. It’s low-fat and has 130 calories per serving.

Change this to: Each serving (1 scoop) has 18 grams of protein and 11 grams of maltodextrin + dextrose. It’s low-fat and has 120 calories per serving.

Under BEACHBODY FUEL SHOT:

Each serving (2 scoops) has 45 grams of dextrose + maltodextrin and 5 grams of whey protein. It’s also low-fat, and has 200 calories per serving.

Change this to: Each serving (1 scoop) has 47 grams of dextrose + maltodextrin and 5 grams of whey protein. It’s also low-fat, and has 210 calories per serving.

We've also worked Beachbody Fuel Shot into the Beas Eating Plan: 2 scoops per day, to be exact.

Change this to: We've also worked Beachbody Fuel Shot into the Beas Eating Plan: 1 scoop per day, to be exact.
