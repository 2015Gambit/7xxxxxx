Notes
Encoder: FridayToker
Source(s): Video: HD-CAM (thanks) Audio: 26k (thanks)

Decided to do this because the source was better than previous, didn't do
a lot to this, just changed the AR and tweaked the colours, brightness,
contrast, saturation etc then muxed in 26k's audio.
I know folk will say the audio is not line and they are probably right but I'm
just calling it same as everyone else, if it's not line then it's the sweetest
cam audio i have heard.
