downloaded.. and your crap does not work, installer can't open, just poping forever."
,7117,2012-08-07T16:10Z,"Developer says:
Versions of Avid software that are not yet code-signed may cause Apple Gatekeeper to display a dialog warn- ing the user that the application is not code-signed. You can proceed with your installation easily by taking these
steps to bypass Gatekeeper when installing:
• Hold down the Control key
• Click on the installer package of the installer you wish to open. A menu will appear near the cursor
• Select “Open” from the menu that appears. A new dialog box will appear
• Select “Open anyway” from the dialog box. This will allow you to proceed with installation regardless of Gatekeeper settings."
