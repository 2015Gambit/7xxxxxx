As much as I liked Daniel Craig's first Bond outing, the 'reboot' angle never sat right with me. Every other Bond has taken over the franchise without a restart to the series, and I thought it fitting to try Craig in the same fashion.

Deleted all references to this being the character's first assignment. Changed the title song. Overall tightened up the flick a little bit ... the poker scene now starts 1 hour even into the film.
