Good luck!"""
,terencemi,2012-08-06T21:25Z,sample starts off fine until 1min 09secs.. quality fluctuates from there on..
,mike953100,2012-08-06T22:37Z,"I'm lol'ing so hard at the info.  428 Kbps bitrate for the whole movie! That is the lowest I think I have ever seen.  Then, I saw that 401 of it went to the video, leaving 27 (or 28) Kbps for 6 CHANNELS!!!! what?!?!?!?  28 Kbps for 2 channels is ungodly low and sounds awful, yet you did that bitrate for 6 channels?!?!?! That is 4.666 KBps per channel.  Omigoodness.  that is worse than any youtube video every by a longshot.  Dude, that's great that you are providing torrents at such small size, but I cannot imagine downloading this ever."

& for small size the quality is reduced."

I am ALWAYS looking for the smallest best quality.....not the smallest horrible quality. Thanks for the upload anyway.....Learn from this, dont get upset bcuz i will be looking for more of your uploads in the future....thanks for the effort +1 from me"
