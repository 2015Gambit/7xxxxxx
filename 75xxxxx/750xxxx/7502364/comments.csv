,teh20,2012-08-04T13:19Z,"Is this from the very recent release that was parted into 2 avi files? If so, I downloaded CD1 and the movie had out of sequence scenes all over. Downloading anyways, hope this version is good! Thanks!"
,WuHaPe,2012-08-04T13:37Z,nuke propably - releases from cocain and blow have 3 repeated scenes
,ZoolooCH,2012-08-04T13:41Z,"@teh20

This is indeed that version. There is a very noticeable mistake around 30:00. This release needs to be nuked! "
,vigilwarped,2012-08-04T13:57Z,tnx HM for the nice up...
,teh20,2012-08-04T14:16Z,"@ZoolooCH | Yeah it just finished for me and I saw the same 3 out of sequence scenes....Gonna try a different release. Trying MAXSPEED now hopefully that one is better. If you find a good one let me know. :/ This one is fine except for the mistakes, if you're like me who went to the movies and saw it AND read the books, you can probably tolerate these mistakes, then again i haven't checked CD2, which may be in even worse condition."
,Dody_Dody,2012-08-04T15:14Z,thanxx alot  i have been waiting for this film ???
,spifkitten99,2012-08-04T15:14Z,"Something is very wrong with this.

Quality is good, but at random times, it repeats scenes from earlier in the movie."
,uheardmebitch,2012-08-04T15:40Z,for gods sake open up your upstream you scungy pricks
,teh20,2012-08-04T15:45Z,"Finished watching second half, sequence is fine but first half has those annoying out of sequence scenes! STAY AWAY and find a better version."
,ppnq,2012-08-04T18:30Z,i like this
,bmdj1992,2012-08-04T20:37Z,"Thanks man.

But how the hell do so many people keep uploading it with repeated scenes...? Is it that difficult?"
,vafler86,2012-08-04T22:50Z,"Just finished watching the movie, and it does have a jump back to a scene thingy. only happened couple of times so its not a big deal.

anyway thansk for the upload. "
,m8rvil,2012-08-04T23:10Z,"I have just watched it, good movie. The repeated scene are really not that annoying. They do not even last that long, so do not be put off by other people's comments. "
,Polymathj,2012-08-05T02:37Z,"It's a good rip, good quality all around but there are some scenes that are repeated.  I don't want to spoil it for the late bloomers out there but again they are ""repeated"" so you're not going to glimpse way ahead and spoil.

They're all about 10-15 second flashbacks to earlier scenes.

Still should be nuked for this."
,alejandrokemper,2012-08-05T02:58Z,calidad? A?/V?

,MUSCLnuts,2012-08-08T15:03Z,Is the scene repeating a Copyright/pirating deterrent? Kind of like a watermark or is it just a bad rip?
,blakenstine,2012-08-13T21:05Z,"good copy thanx
