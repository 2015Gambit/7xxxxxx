,cxnecroxc,2012-08-06T05:41Z,"@coocooforcocopuffs
because its 720p(higher resolution and high video and audio bit rates) makes files larger. Thank god it isnt 1080p ;-)"

,KD360,2012-08-06T10:47Z,"Omg what happened to Immerse? 2HD? This is the third Episode with 2ch. It sounds ridiculous on my 5.1 System, for the love of god, evolve! Give me 6ch or let someone else release!"
,AZChick924,2012-08-20T11:14Z,"HM, where's 10 and 11?  Have you dropped the ball?"
,AZChick924,2012-08-20T11:17Z,And it says I need a decoder just to listen to the audio track.  Please stick to uploading it as an avi file.  I don't want to dl something else just to watch an episode.
