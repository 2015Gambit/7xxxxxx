when the final version is out ?"
,genenioo,2012-08-13T22:49Z,"This is what I'm looking for but with RTM.  Everyone is obsessed with enterprise/pro AIOs, but almost everyone will have either pro or the core ""home"" version.  I was able to unlock the core version from pro rtm images with a ei.cfg file but haven't been able to do so with the enterprise/pro AIOs."
,genenioo,2012-08-13T22:54Z,By the way does anyone know if the procedure for making this AIO the same as with win 7?  I made my own with 7 but not sure that the method I used will work with win 8.
