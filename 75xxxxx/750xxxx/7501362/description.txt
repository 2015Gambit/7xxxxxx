
Super Mario Sunshine


Mario makes his debut on the Nintendo GameCube with Super Mario 
Sunshine. On a vacation away from the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario 
finds himself in a messy situation on the island of Delphino, 
where a Mario look alike has been causing all kinds of trouble. 
Explore huge 3D environments that range from a lush waterfall 
paradise, to an exciting amusement park complete with a 
rollercoaster you can ride. Mario makes use of a new water pack, 
which allows him to hover, launch, and rocket around levels, as 
well as spray enemies with. Mario has never had so many cool new 
moves, or looked so good in 3D.
