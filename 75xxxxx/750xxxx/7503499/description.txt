Designed from the beginning to integrate seamlessly into your workflow, Stock Keeper offers unique features not found anywhere else.

Stock Keeper has a web browser built-in, with the ability to create "search groups" of favorite websites. Click a search group and all websites open in tabs in Stock Keeper's built-in browser. Search online for images or media, and download directly into Stock Keeper's library. Stock Keeper will keep track of what website files came from, so you can easily find it online later if you need to purchase a high-res version.

Stock Keeper's library allows you to create collections and smart folders. Browse through your library, search and filter. Everything added to your library allows you to add metadata to it: tags, notes, how much you paid, the usage license, and more. It also has a built-in media player so you can view any QuickTime-supported file format (audio or video.) And Stock Keeper has its own library file, so you never have to worry about where the file is. When you need a file, you just drag it out of Stock Keeper to where you need it.

Stock Keeper also features a menubar browser, so you can access and search your entire Stock Keeper media library from any application. Whether you work in Illustrator, InDesign, Keynote, or even Microsoft Word, Stock Keeper puts your entire media library at your fingertips.
