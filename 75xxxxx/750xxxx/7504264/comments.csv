But to EVERYONE who is downloading it, PLEASE PLEASE consider buying this book. It is a great reference and with most of you probably being a computer geek you've got to know the full effects of pirating and know the only way we can get more books like this is to support the writer, Nicolai M. Josuttis. (I am very guilty of pirating too much, I'm not saying I'm better than you.) But it is only $60.00 (I know ""only"") at Barnes and Noble and the feeling of actually buying something is actually kind of nice.. I haven't had this feeling in a while.. I was waiting for this book to come out 3 months before it did and got it the day it did come out.. XD

But long story short... Consider actually buying this book if you haven't already. :p"
