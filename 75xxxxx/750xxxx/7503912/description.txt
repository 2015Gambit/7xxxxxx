                           DESCRiPTiON 

 A British documentary crew is allowed to film an Amish family from the 
 religious group's strictest order. Miriam and David Lapp hope that by allowing 
 the cameras into their home in Pennsylvania, they can help create a greater 
 understanding of their way of life and faith. However, by agreeing to 
 participate in the programme, they risk excommunication from their church, 
 which forbids its members from consenting to be photographed. 

                                 Enjoy!
