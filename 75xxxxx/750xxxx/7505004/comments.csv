,sixteentons12,2012-08-11T06:56Z,"Hey, really appreciate the torrent and all your hard work!

However, I am getting some issues here. I put the game in the iso folder after unzipping, it showed up on my games menu, and it loaded the first few screens of company logos. However, I see little gals floating around a loading sign on the botom right of the screen and then everything goes black. The game continues, but nothing seems to load (I have waited at least ten minutes.

Any ideas how one could fix this? I have M33-4 3.71 on a 2000, so I wonder if this is the issue?

thanks for your time!"
,SrPapaCabeza,2012-08-11T17:12Z,What if I don't speak Japanese and I want to understanding what they're saying during the cut scenes?
,Tim83,2012-08-12T02:01Z,I read in an article on Kotaku that during the animated cut scenes which in this undub version will be in Japanese ofc there is no option to turn on subtitles is that true? I definitely prefer the original Japanese voice overs over any shity English sub anytime but always with English text to understand wtf is happening because unfortunately I cant understand Japanese so there is nothing we can do to understand what they say during cut scenes???
,Tim83,2012-08-12T02:03Z,"""over any shity English DUB""

no edit option :/"
,jredkai,2012-08-12T04:10Z,"yeah, great work man!! runs great for me!! but is there any way to find out what is being said during the video sequences, this seems like a super wicked story and I cant really just ""live with it"" not knowing what is actually going on...subtitles maybe?

Anyway, thanks again!!"
,horatiobo,2012-08-14T07:11Z,"It's good, but it's not great.  The game runs fine for me, and the Japanese voiceovers are nice.  However, I really can't stand not knowing what's going on in the cutscenes.  If you care about them and can live without the Japanese try this torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7503071/[PSP]_Growlanser_Wayfer_of_Time_(ISO)"
,KorriS,2012-08-26T05:59Z,"This is awesome, it'll be nice to have the voices back. But seriously, before you go bashing a company who a) brought over a game no one else would have, and b) did a damn fine job doing it outside of the voice work issue, at least learn why.

This isn't the ""hatchet job"" you describe it as. Voice work costs money. A lot of it. The fact of the matter was that Atlus wanted SOMETHING in the game, be it the JP track or a dub track. But their budget didn't turn out to be big enough to license the JP voice track or afford a new dub. Totally fucking legit.

So, you know, while I appreciate having the voices back, you could not be a dumbass about it and be happy that Atlus brought over the game at all. They could have... you know. Not. Then were would y' be? Or right. Not playing this great game."
,omegaviper,2012-09-09T17:26Z,why would you undo the english now it is back to japenese.  who thought it would be a good idea to make it not understandable.
