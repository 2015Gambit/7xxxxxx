The use of energy is being shaped by environmental issues including the fear of global warming. This has resulted in the development of renewable energy sources and more efficient building technology. Examining trends in energy efficiency, this book explores energy technologies and fuels, their prospects in a world with greenhouse gas restrictions. It looks at the technical and economic tradeoffs of traditional renewables such as wind and solar, as well as large scale PV and concentrated thermal power. It also considers biomass technologies. For each of these technologies, it discusses  planning, siting, installation, operation and maintenance, health and safety, power conditioning, and efficiency innovations.
