There were a few batched with 0801 in the mix, some had repeats,some had some stuff which must have been requests because they were really way back in date, and then there was new stuff.

I don't have the time to seperate all of it into imprints,release dates, etc so feel
free to select what you want from within your torrent client.

As always, credit to the scanners and editors, buy what you like new from your local shop and pick up a few back issues while your there.

Seed Seed Seed I have to shut down a while this weekend so after initial seeding keep her rolling...  Thanx!
