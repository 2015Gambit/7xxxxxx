Don't have no fear, it is not contained virus, backdoor, trojan or anything junk.
This is clean.

Install instructions:

There is no trick, this is a normal bootable ISO image.

- Download
- Write with a DVD burning program
- Install

Important more: this version is untouched: no loader, no integrated serial, nothing.
If you need those stuffs, you must find.
I know there is working many Windows 7 loader on it.
This version is 'raw' yet. The refined variant of this notebook edition is under construction.
But I tested this, and work well.

Recommended for:
	- older notebooks that made originally for Vista OS
	- older 1 or 2 core processor (such as Athlon/Celeron/Core2Duo etc...)
	- 1 or 2 gigybayte RAM
	- weaker video hardware

So, main point is this version of Vista OS working perfect on older/weaker notebooks.

Ok, I think there is not more important thing, I hope.
Anything problem with this torrent/program, write me and I try to solve.

Bye.
