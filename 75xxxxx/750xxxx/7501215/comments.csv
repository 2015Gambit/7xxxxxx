,onic299,2012-08-04T08:38Z,I am one downloader 
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-04T09:00Z,"You aren't the only downloader, I have downloaded this too, at 1.3 + Mbs. =) I don't care to play any other mode as long as I can play it in Practice and all the stuff I gain, saves after I quit... Doubt it though."
,Doodaday,2012-08-04T12:22Z,"What does ""Copy all files from the TiNYiSO folder to the main installation directory"" mean? I don't see a TiNTiSO folder, and I don't know what a main installation directory is. 

I mounted and installed the iso, have the desktop icon in place, and click it to start the game. The launch box pops up (where you can choose screen resolution and the like) but when I hit launch, the box closes, and... nothing. It doesn't start."
,amann95,2012-08-04T13:39Z,Green_luma download it and u can play online :)
,la_cross37,2012-08-04T15:51Z,"Does this version save ""practice"" progress?"
,Dz_95,2012-08-04T17:37Z,@la_cross37 yes this version save practice
,Hajeil,2012-08-04T21:00Z,"@Doodaday Uninstall and then reinstall. After reinstalling DO NOT launch the game. Right click the desktop shortcut and select ""Properties"" then click on ""Find Target Folder."" This will take you to the main installation directory ie the main folder that holds all sub-folders and files that make up the installation. Now open up the disc image and you will see a folder called ""TiNYiSO."" Open that and then copy all of the files from there and paste them into the main installation folder that you previously opened. Make sure that if it asks you if you want to copy over previous files that you select yes. Now you can delete your desktop shortcut and create a new one by right clicking on the AwesomenautsLauncher.exe in the main installation folder and then selecting ""Send to Desktop (Create Shortcut). Now you can launch the game and it will work just fine. Enjoy!"
,Doodaday,2012-08-05T01:33Z,"@Hajeil

How do you open up the disc image? Whenever I try to open the iso, from the desktop or from the virtual drive due to it being mounted, it just goes through the installation again"
,Hajeil,2012-08-05T03:28Z,"@Doodaday You must have your PC set to auto boot discs. Just mount the image and then close the installer if/when it starts up. Then if you are using Windows 7 simple open up Windows Explorer and on the left hand side in the tree you should see Awesomenauts mounted to your virtual drive. Just left click on that and then you will see all of the files on the disc. Open the TiNYiSO folder from there, copy all the files in it and apply them to the main installation folder of the game. Then make your new desktop shortcut for the AwesomenautsLaunch.exe, launch the game and have fun."
,Doodaday,2012-08-05T05:28Z,"@Hajeil

Unfortunately, that's way over my head. I don't know what ""Set your computer to auto boot discs"" means. No matter what I do, the installer comes up, and nothing more. Closing the installer just closes the installer. No TiNYiSO folder shows up anywhere. "
,Doodaday,2012-08-05T05:33Z,"Is there a specific program you need to use to open the disc image? The only programs that show for me are daemons tools and imgburn, neither of which help me. "
,Hajeil,2012-08-05T07:50Z,@ Doodaday I have created an installation tutorial for you on Youtube. Go to Youtube and search for VidiotEntertainment. In the results you will see a video titled How to Install Awesomenauts TiNYiSO. Click on that and watch it. I hope it helps you to better understand how the cracking process works so that you can enjoy this and future game releases.
,Doodaday,2012-08-05T07:52Z,"Finally figured out how to do it, but the game won't work. When I boot it up, the whole computer freezes and I have to reset. I waited half an hour, but it stayed frozen. "
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-05T10:48Z,"1. Go download Steam
2. Get Greenluma from here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6854781/GreenLuma-2.2.9-Steam

3. Crack Steam (I made a backup of Steam's original files just in case.)

4. Go to Skidrow's website and type in Awesomenauts, download their crack with the direct download link.

5. Crack Awesomenauts.
6. Play it and have fun =) 

My tips on how I did it."
,Doodaday,2012-08-05T12:45Z,"I have no idea what Steam is. Anyway, I'm going to have to give up on this, unfortunately. It's just not working no matter what I do. My computer constantly freezes when I try to boot it up. Guess this'll just be a game I never play. "
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-05T21:08Z,"Dude, just go search google for steam download, get the greenluma download from my link.
Go to skidrow's website and get the crack. DIRECT DOWNLOAD. Copy all of the files from the crack besides the 2 internet files, into the Awesomenauts folder, and read the readme at the top of the greenluma readme. It tells you what files to copy over to steam. Then run steam, you will see a green guy in the top right of the program. Keep it running, right click the awesomenauts launcher and send it to the desktop as a shortcut. Click it, lower your resolution if your computer isn't fast, play it and have fun man"
,Hajeil,2012-08-05T22:00Z,@Magic_friendly He doesn't even know how to properly crack games. He's new to this. If he can't even get this simple crack to work it's pointless trying to get him to also attempt to get a cracked version of Steam working. It would only complicate things.
,la_cross37,2012-08-05T22:31Z,"Works great except the fact that it crashes if you go back to windows with the game on...

I'm running windows 7 32 bit.

I've tried to run it as administrator but with no luck. I haven't tried any of the compatibility modes though."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-06T01:57Z,"True. Oh well, their loss. If your game is crashing, try running it in a window instead of full screen... Unless you are playing at a low res with full screen? 
I just tested it and it runs fine for me. Sorry it doesn't for you... Idk if it's just me either but, the online still isn't working. But.. Of course. I do not know much about connecting to others through Hamachi or Tungle."
,Doodaday,2012-08-06T03:00Z,"My computer is 14 years old. Chances are, it just can't run these games. "
,Hajeil,2012-08-06T06:51Z,"System Requirements

Minimum:

OS:Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8
Processor:Any processor with 2 Cores
Memory:2 GB RAM
Graphics:ATI or Nvidia Videocard with at least 256MB, or Intel GMA 950 or newer
Hard Drive:600 MB HD space

Recommended:

OS:Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8
Processor:Any processor with 2 Cores
Memory:2 GB RAM
Graphics:ATI or Nvidia Videocard with at least 512MB
Hard Drive:600 MB HD space
Other Requirements:Broadband Internet connection"
,Doodaday,2012-08-06T07:08Z,"Ah, that would be why, then. My memory and my graphics card aren't good enough. I don't know what a processor is"
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-06T11:02Z,"I would like to put my specs up for people to let them know..

My graphics card is ATI Radeon 3200 HD series... 
Even in the low graphics settings, its still beautiful.

Ram - 3 GB. I have enough, even at 2 you have enough.

Processor - Single core 1.6 GHz. It runs just fine. 
I run it at 1024 x 768 in the low quality, but that's because I can't go higher or lower right now. I can put it on medium even and it runs alright. But dude, if your computer is 14 years old... How are you even on this site if you do not know what a processor is?? Lol... It's basically the power of your computer. Seeing how it's so old, the computer doesn't have enough power to run it. So it's just crashing. It's like lifting something at 225 lbs when you can only do 100 max. You try, but just give out in the end and crash. Go to a pawn shop and buy a cheap laptop. Even if it has XP, Vista or even Windows 7, it's still better. What are you running? 98? Which isn't bad btw, but you gotta upgrade man. Lol."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-06T11:05Z,"The reason I can't go lower is because I am having issues with my screen not stretching in games, and downloading ATI Catalyst Control Center does not seem to be working, seeing how it does not load up once I dl and install it. This is also a cracked version of Windows 7, but that should not have anything to do with it. Anyone got a tip for me? I'm tired of putting games in 800 x 600 just for the screen to be small. The processor is only a single core, so it cannot handle TOO much, but still... "
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-13T08:46Z,"Hey Hajeil, will you be uploading the update and the dlc character, Gnaw? I sure hope so. It definately needs an update for sure."
,Hajeil,2012-08-17T00:45Z,@Magic_friendly if a Scene group releases the update that includes Gnaw and some else doesn't upload it here before I get it downloaded then I will provide it.
,SoulForEver,2012-08-17T01:05Z,"hard to comment, always "" Datebase error "" and I have a question, hope can help me.
I hope this will be Submit, not sure about it"
,SoulForEver,2012-08-17T01:16Z,"Hey Hajeil,

dose this save practice ?? Because By
  ""  azaq318 ""  do not save Practice & I hate this, Download same game twice.
Also I have problem with steam crack, if you have a video to show me how would be nice to play Online, even Offline this game ROCK
Thanks"
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-17T03:30Z,"@Hajeil
Thank you man. I noticed that Derpl is SO over-powered, Leon seems fine, Clunk seems good too, but that damn Sheriff needs a fix and Coco is hard to use but still powerful if used properly.

@SoulForEver
Yes it does save practice. I tried the other one and it's nice that it's like a demo, seeing how Steam does not provide one... But this does save your practice for sure. =)

I found through Tungle's forum, someone has an MP Lan fix, it's more a crack than just a fix... But I cannot test it out. Thought I would point people to that to try it. But this game is just $10, I would think about just buying it anyways."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-17T03:32Z,"Then again, if Hajeil gets his hands on more updates and uploads more things, I'll be a committed downloader for a VERY long time. =) Thanks again man"
