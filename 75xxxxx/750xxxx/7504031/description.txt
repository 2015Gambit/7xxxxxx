I am in Acapulco and wanted to read one of Ross MacdonaldΓÇÖs Lew ArcherΓÇÖs mysteries, but surprise, surprise I could not find a single E-book here or in any other torrent site. 

Amazing, right!

Well, trying to readdress this serious imbalance in the torrents' universe, I give you three Ross MacdonaldΓÇÖs E-books in epub and mobi formats:

The Chill - Lew Archer 11, 
The Far Side of the Dollar - Lew Archer 12, and
Black Money - Lew Archer 13.

If you have any of his books in any format, please upload them for the benefit of all Lew ArcherΓÇÖs fans.

Enjoy!!!
