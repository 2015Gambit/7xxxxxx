,zpolty,2012-08-05T12:45Z,"love u nikita200 :)
@MsLFi this one's the x86 version"
,nilax22,2012-08-05T12:48Z,where is windows 8 pro 64bit 
,iru5555,2012-08-05T13:02Z,tis is the RTM version
,gunduboss,2012-08-05T13:05Z,Is it Consumer Preview Version or Developer Version ??????????
,x_engine,2012-08-05T13:06Z,"Is it a bootable ISO file,or no bootable ?"
,demis1159,2012-08-05T13:22Z,"Where can I find an activation crack or patch to activate the windows ?
How to find and how to install a Greek mui ?"
,MsLFi,2012-08-05T13:27Z,"But that also was x86.... I managed to download it from this magnet link magnet:?xt=urn:btih:FF5459C9B9B3169ECD1F9BC9463C3C2B7095CC3F

So - is there difference?"
,cursed7,2012-08-05T13:35Z,"I created an account just to post this: 

@nilax22: do a search you MORON! You managed to find this torrent so how hard is it to find the 64 bit version???

@iru5555: Bravo! Thanks to your spelling I am not even sure if you were asking a question or answering some invisible question, but DUUUUUH! Look at the torrent name: Windows 8 Enterprise RTM. RTM RTM RTM. See it now?

@gunduboss: Just leave. And never ever download any versions of Windows. Just go and buy it from a shop. You have no business whatsoever trying a non-release version of any OS. You'll just kill your computer and go waste your daddy's dollars in order to have someone format it and get it working again.

@x_engine: it's the bootable version. The only non-bootable version was the first leaked version of the Windows 8 Enterprise N-version
"
,cursed7,2012-08-05T13:41Z,"@demis1159 : You will probably NEVER be able to activate it. It's an Enterprise edition. If you took the time to search what this means, you would have come to the conclusion that this most likely means that the only way to activate it is through a corporate server. You could wait a week or so till the Pro version leaks and get that. 
Forget the geniuses who say that Windows 8 Ent is the same as Windows 7 Ultimate. You probably won't understand what the extra features available in Windows 8 Ent are for and the reason is: you don't need them! So if you're looking to upgrade your main PC just wait a little bit... No rush... "
,heuir2,2012-08-05T13:48Z,"@cursed7: It does need a corporate server to activate, but with the talent crackers have out here, its possible a patch will be out in a month that emulates a corporate server activation. Cheers tpb!"
,nilax22,2012-08-05T13:51Z,talk about moron cursed7 i ask about windows 8  professional 64bit 
,heuir2,2012-08-05T14:04Z,@nikita200: How can you be sure its not just the preview version with name changes?
,sapo_joe,2012-08-05T14:13Z,"Does anyone still use x86 windows?? Except for XP, there's no need for it anymore! 

But, thanks to nikita200, ur great for sharing this!"
,xpmule,2012-08-05T14:25Z,"@MsLFi
it is the same thing he uploaded.
look at the hash in this topic and then the hash in the link you have.
I downloaded it and verified even though I will not be using it ;)
I posted that link on nikita's x64 rtm topic last night (so i KNOW its the legit Final version)

you guys the torrent description answers most of your questions..
Its an image from MS.
It is the RTM version (its not beta etc)
nikita200 is a trusted uploader.
When the activation crack loader is available trust me we will ALL know about ;) Just sit back and wait patiently
and if needed re arm your 30 days with the run prompt..
""slmgr.vbs /rearm""
Thats a script that comes with most versions of windows made by microsoft, you can find it in your windows system32 directory."
,japrage_s,2012-08-05T14:45Z,"jeez, the guys at this torrent are ignorant and tries to proof with everything they can that this isnt the finale version.

PEOPLE, IT IS THE RTM VERSION, THE SAME VERSION THAT HAS BEEN SENT TO CD MANUFACTORY ASWELL AS OEM PARTNERS. YES IT HAS A WATERMARK BUT EVERY FINAL VERSION OF WINDOWS DOES UNTIL YOU ACTIVATE IT WITH A LEGITIME KEY. NOW, PLEASE, THIS IS FINALE VERSION. IF YOU CANT ACCEPT THAT, WAIT OCTOBER 27TH AND BUY RETAIL.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,japrage_s,2012-08-05T14:45Z,...snotty bastards
,silfeeg,2012-08-05T14:58Z,"Thank you so much for uploading the X86 version

I assume this is NOT  an N edition right?"
,cursed7,2012-08-05T15:15Z,"@nilax22:

My comment still stands: SEARCH. Can't find it? It doesn't exist. 

@heuir2:

Fine but even if someone DOES manage to crack it, why not just wait a few more days to get the version that actually targets us, non-enterprise users? Plus if you check some websites, including the Win8 wiki, you'll notice that Windows Media Center cannot be installed on Windows Enterprise which could be an early sign that Windows Enterprise won't include this kind of apps (which is actually logical). In any case, I'd rather get the Pro version which won't be bloated with all these extra features that no one will ever need outside an office environment. "
,extracube,2012-08-05T15:19Z,"@sapo_joe: from what I understand x64 requires a lot more hardware power (memory, cpu process speed, vid card), so some of us with computers 3 years old or more still prefer the x86 because of the lighter load.  Also, I read that even if you install x64 OS's or software, ALL hardware involved has to be fully x64 in order for the system to truly utilize x64, which means not only each hardware piece, but also drivers for each piece of hardware.  Otherwise, if not, it's a waste, because even though your computer will have to perform more calculations in order to run an x64 OS, you won't get the benefit.

If I'm mistaken on anything then please correct."
,MsLFi,2012-08-05T15:25Z,"@japrage_s
I fully agree with you. It would be stupid if MS would sent Beta or not fully completed versions to their partners"

,gunduboss,2012-08-05T18:05Z,"@nikita200: thk u very much.
