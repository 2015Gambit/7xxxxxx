Thanks to the original uploaders of these. I included all of the issues currently available. 

Note: Issue 27 is meant to be read after Issue 18. They did a time jump, and that was the order it was released. Then they went back to Issue 19. Issue 27.2 is the "Second Helping Edition" which came out after 26 and it just slightly different than the original Issue 27.

Also included is the one-shot Secret Agent Poyo.
