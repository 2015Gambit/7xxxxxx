
QUAKE

A full release of Quake, the first-person shooter video game released by
id Software in the 1996.

Even after so much time Quake game-play stands as one of the better
first-person shooter available, follow the story of an unnamed heroic
soldier against the unknown enemy codenamed ``quake.''

About 70 levels plenty of deadly traps, angry enemies and dark corridors
await you in the single player campaign.


This torrent hashes a 7z file with the game data, including music, for:

Quake (id1)
Scourge of Armagon (hipnotic)
Dissolution of Eternity (rogue)
Abyss of Pandemonium (impel)

The third expansion was sold without the id logo, so it is unofficial.
But it follows the original story, with a twist, and it gives nice new
levels with new musics, so until id gives us an official follow-up it
deserve to be here.

Few extras are included: ``death match essential'' for multiplayer mayhem and
``future vs fantasy'' for coop with its fun Quest Mode and well done classes
system. If you have chance for an oldstyle LAN party, do not miss them!

Musics are named and placed so that modern engines will use them instead
of CD tracks. Maps are already patched to support transparent water.

It is also included a small autoexec.cfg file in each directory to set the
three most wanted setting: mouse free look; no autoaim; and ``Run always,
don't Always Run(0)'' so do not activate the ``Always run'' in the menus.


IMPORTANT: only the game data are included, you have to find a Quake engine.

Try Quakespasm(1) for faithful looks and faithful features for a real
nostalgia trip in the year 1996!

If you would like a revamp try Darkplaces(2): set full lighting and high
effects for more modern aspect while keeping the original assets.

Or for a total replacement of graphics and sounds, you can try Quake
Epsilon(3) that uses Darkplaces plus lots of new content.

New graphics or old one? New sounds or old ones?  It does not matter much
at the end, the point is the great oldschool gameplay.

Enjoy and seed. This game is a must for everyone.




Musics are included in Vorbis format compressed with quality 2, if you
feel that the musics are overcompressed download(4) the lossless copies
and and compress as you wish.
