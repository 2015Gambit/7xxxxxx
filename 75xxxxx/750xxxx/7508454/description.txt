blink-182's last four studio albums (Enema of the State, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, blink-182, and Neighborhoods [Deluxe Edition]) in 320kbs.

BPM is calculated, lyrics are included, and it's all properly tagged, with no extra garbage tags. Formatted for iTunes 10, and tested on a 4th generation iPod touch.

Please leave feedback as there are a couple of other artists I would do this for if people like it. Thank you.
