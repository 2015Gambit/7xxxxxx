,Hajeil,2012-08-04T05:55Z,"@j3xified  I'm not sure why it's going so slow. I have uploading set to unlimited. Hopefully everyone who download will be kind enough to seed back unlimited also to at leat a 1-1 ratio to help increase availability and speed. @Mr.BlizzardBeta I'm not sure whether or not this Dawnguard update includes all previous updates though I'd assume so. To be safe and ensure that Dawnguard works, please make sure that you have installed Update 9 before installing Dawnguard.  You can get Update 9 which also include all previous updates from scene4all here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7367164/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.9-RELOADED"
,Hajeil,2012-08-04T06:18Z,"@kevi3434 I can't be for sure but I would say no since the files have two different names. I got this from a link on Releaselog.

Dawnguard DLC Cracked-ALI213"" and the one on Skidrowgames seems to be named ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Dawnguard – FULL CRACKED – DLC – UPDATED.""

xberzerk (comment page 3 of this torrent) said that he fixed that problem by installing update 10 which he said could be found on tpb. 

Hajeil (comment page 3 of this torrent) says that update 10 is what is included in this torrent.

Either way I installed update 9 (from skidrow's website) and then replaced all files from the folder in this torrent to the appropriate folders in my skyrim directory, I also copied all the random files and folders (which weren't replacing any files in the skyrim directory) to where they seemed to go
(as shown in the ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Update v1.7.7.0.6 Incl Dawnguard DLC"" folder).

There is another torrent on tbp labeled as including 'update 10' but the main files were removed by norton antivirus so I'd rather not try that torrent.

Can anyone offer any help? "

,randomnab,2012-08-05T13:44Z,"Eh I have a retarded problem. Long story short, had skyrim 1.1 (i think at least lol) installed update 9 then this. Now i have a few weird issues. The first one is a small deal, the skill trees especially the vampire lord one take a while to load and sometimes crash the game if i click too fast.

The other issue is quite serious. The map doesnt load. I go to places but the textures just dont load i can only see the base ones, the ones that u see from a distance. So i cant enter towns since i walk through the walls. Enemies wont load either, nothing loads and the only way to fix it is to minimize the game then restore. That seems to load everything around me but i cant minimize every 5 seconds to load EVERY 10 meter area i visit... Someone please help me"

Anyway, I just want to ask about the creation kit and the other folders and files that were not in the main directory before.. I never modded my Skyrim or changed anything in it.. so it kinda bugs me that its there now.. is it part of the Dawnguard DLC? will this affect or changed my game?"

I took one look at the folder contents, realized how completely f*d up it was, and downloaded another torrent; I could have spent an hour trying to organize the contents in the proper order so a stable install is possible, but I could also just download a decent torrent in even less time. Unless you are able to manually organize your load order, and then feel like researching file sizes to find out which of the extra contents are the correct version, then cleaning out the folders that don't belong and restoring the file versions that do, you shouldn't bother  with this - it was obviously put together very, very shabbily.

,NightNiix,2012-08-21T00:28Z,dude! I can select Data Files menu! BUT IT IS BLANK! Even with Dawnguard.bsa/esm on Data folder.
,marck527,2012-08-21T09:49Z,"You have to install this first: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7367164/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.9-RELOADED

BEFORE installing this one, other wise Dawnguard.esm will NOT show up in Data Files."
,xXSebiXx,2012-08-21T14:36Z,Thx...this is what i wanted
,PC101,2012-08-22T04:10Z,"CHECK IT OUT: If you have a problem with Data Files being UNSELECTABLE, find skyrimprefs.ini in your D:Program Files (x86)The Elder Scrolls V SkyrimSkyrimSkyrimPrefs.ini or similar folder. Then you need to open it in a text editor and add the following line changes: 

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
bEnableFileSelection=1

Make sure to save it in the same spot and file type."
,Srmndr,2012-08-22T16:06Z,"Hello guys. I have a question : if I download some skyrim without any updates installed (just release version), so in this case I will have to install all the updates from 1 to 9 before installing this very update which includes Dawnguard. In other words I can't install the latest update untill I install all the previous updates, am I right?"
,THE-FIZZZ,2012-08-23T06:42Z,im doing everything right but when i open the skyrim launcher it doesnt let me click on data files
,Srmndr,2012-08-23T15:20Z,"Yep,I see that update 9 is required."
,waverock,2012-08-24T08:16Z,this crack works with the SkSE mod? 
,waverock,2012-08-24T08:20Z,"THE-FIZZZ - you have to add the line ""benablefileselection=1"" in the file skyrimprefs located in the folder ""documentsmy gamesskyrim"""
,CCLegend,2012-08-24T16:33Z,"DON'T USE THIS! 
The folders are completly fucked up, he has various files that are in te wrong place and actually seem to appear various times in diffrent places. It will work to a certain point and then bug the shit out of your game. New places don't load up properly, you get stupid bugs like permanent snowflakes floating in front of you and stuff like that. This is pure crap!"
,yusszx,2012-08-27T12:34Z,better wait for reloaded release
,tadeuelias554,2012-08-28T15:50Z,"Thx Uploader, but we can't access the Data Files to allow the Dawnguard... This problem is fixed by copying and saving the following lines inside Skyrimprefs.ini, in Documents/My ganes/Skyrim: 

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
bEnableFileSelection=1

Note: You have to SEARCH the Line and replace, not just copy...

This way the Data Files will be able to be clicked...

Sorry if you find any error in the text, i'm brazilian :D"
,maxnub,2012-08-28T22:18Z,"@ lord1389

Thanks bro! worked to enable data files option.

Registered an account just to say thanks, so THANKS AGAIN!"
,SweetDreamerTestbed,2012-08-29T21:24Z,"Thanks for the upload and I'm sure it works but there are A LOT of superfluous files from the uploader's personal directory here. There are unnecessary extracted shader files and copies of which exist in the main folder plus another unused esm. On top of that there are leftover files and construction kit remnants. These not only add size to the upload but in the case of the extra esms and texture folder could be modified in ways that not everyone might want.

There are too many junk files here. The only things needed to play Dawnguard(granted the user has update 1.6) are the Dawnguard esm/bsa and the cracked 1.7 exe. The rest of this are potentially altered files from a user's personal directory."
,s.tuck,2012-09-02T12:19Z,"I have installed the game and it sais that danwguard.esm in data file in my launcher. I press OK and I start up the game, but however it doesn't seem to work. Because if I speak to guards or try to locate where the fort is supposed to be. I can't find it. Please help because I really want to try it out before I buy it."
,Derpy123,2012-09-03T21:39Z,SEED PLEASE!!!
,hiraku90,2012-09-04T03:22Z,"Um, I tried doing that copy and paste thing for SkyrimPrefs but for some reason, my Data Files is still not showing up in the Launchers."
,jk7899,2012-09-06T21:20Z,"This is lord1389s comment and this worked for me.                                                                                                                                        ENABLE DATA FILES!!!! 

Go to ---> C:Users""USERNAME""Documents My Games Skyrim and select file “SkyrimPrefs”; Add these lines, or change them if they already exist so they match the below:
 [Launcher]
 bEnableFileSelection=1

Hope i helped =D
"
,Spinfx,2012-09-08T16:43Z,"@jk7899:
Thanks for your invaluable help, the [Launcher] section already had 2 entries but didn't have that one. Adding it made the Data Files option available. Thanks again!"
,Robo_Warrior,2012-09-12T00:59Z,"It works with the razer release, just do as jk7899 says and when You'll reach 10 level the dawnguards will find You. (They've found me as soon as I got to the whiterun near the companions house.) Btw. great DLC, Skyrim was getting quite boring and it freshened it up. :)"
,Robo_Warrior,2012-09-12T01:00Z,"I mean razor1911, sry, my bad."
,CourtReen,2012-09-15T08:44Z,Thanks for the upload works great! 
,xcylent,2012-09-18T14:58Z,"Hey. Great torrent, but now whenever I double-click on the skyrimlauncher on my desktop, all I get is ""The program can't start because steam_api.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem""
How can I make the game work again?"
