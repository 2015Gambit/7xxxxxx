Description

Have You Got The Bulls?

Take your darts skills out of your local and challenge players worldwide, without even having to buy them a pint, with Legends of Darts PRO ONLINE.

Players will need timing, accuracy and nerve to rise to the top of the league in this absorbing game, which was originally developed from a ΓÇ£Skill with PrizesΓÇ¥ (SWP) pub machine by leading UK independent developer FatSpanner.

ΓÇ£This is not a simulator, it takes the strategic rather than the physical elements of the darts game. ΓÇ£Legends of Darts enjoyed tens of millions of plays in UK pubs before we developed the original iPhone game, Legends of Darts WORLD MASTERS.

Building on the success of the original iPhone top 10 game Legends of Darts WORLD MASTERS, Legends of Darts PRO ONLINE takes arcade darts to another level.

Play against friends or hundreds of thousands of other players online in both league play and exclusive tournaments.
