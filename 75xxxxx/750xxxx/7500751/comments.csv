,topjimmy68,2012-08-06T23:22Z,"Found this in the comments of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7500071/WINDOWS_8_ENTERPRISE-N_RTM_X64_VOLUME_ENGLISH_BOOT_DVD_%5BThumperD

Open command promt as admin
If you are using Pro, type these lines ONE BY ONE!
slmgr -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato

If you are using Enterprise:
slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr /ato
slmgr /dli

For me, activation details shows ""Your license to use Windows expires on 2/2/2013""
Plenty of time for now, if this holds up."
