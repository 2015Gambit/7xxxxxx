NOTES:

Ok yes this is a straight re-encode of seen-cm8 ....we won't lie
Took the video cut into two and removed the black borders and resized too match the rest of the video.
Then cleaned the video changing the colouring,brightness,contrast etc....
Will be honest and say its smoother probably then there but not by much ....and thats because we needed too use
the smoother option.
What the screenies on their release didn't show was how it looks in a frame by frame view in vdub.....the video
is full on noise now and again and had to be fixed.
SEE SCREENS BELOW !!!

Once done onto to the audio ...nice and powerful compared too the other line we had,but still had some noise/static
to it and also oos in parts,only slightly though.
So first off cleaned audio changing the EQ bands and lowering the bands that contained the noise ...then we resyncd it and
then remuxed too our encode.
