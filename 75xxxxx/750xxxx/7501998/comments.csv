And yes Nashville Fans, even Country and Western numbers have been shown, but of course never Won.

Volare only came 3rd so you did not even have to win the contest to have a major hit on your hands, but if you did win Eurovision, well just ask Abba, Bucks Fizz, Celine Dion, Johnny Logan, Katrina & The Waves, Lulu or ANY Eurovision song contest winner what that did to there professional career.

Volare even went on the get to number one in the USA and Canada, and at that time they could not even listen to the ESC, except on the Short Wave, let alone watch it.   Few performers in the early 60’s realized that they were also playing a part in the Cultural Revolution which grew out of the cold War, and that Eurovision was WINNING that War over the heavily censored music which was broadcast in the Soviet Block at the time.  Few people in the USSR knew that at the time the eastern bloc were losing the youth but the Soviet government DID and as the numbers willing to risk there lives crossing the Wall into West Germany grew and grew, so did the viewers to Eurovision year on year.   Soon over 100 MILLION were tuning in, and this back in the days of Black and White TV signals.

As the Berlin wall went up in 1961 the Soviets also constructed hundreds of Jamming stations in an attempt to block TV signals from the West crossing over into communist territory.   Finding it almost impossible to keep the Western Media out the Eastern bloc the communist state resorted to copying it with a Song Contest of their own which was held in Poland.  For a while it worked but it was not enough to keep the young people of the eastern bloc happy and soon they started to rebel.   An age of protest sprung up everywhere, well everywhere EXCEPT Eurovision which remained stubbornly mainstream.
By viewing this Documentary I have just found out that that Votes were bought by the Spanish Dictator Franco, knocking the UK back to 2nd place one year, that is just how serious things were getting.   Ireland was struggling to feed its people and needed a big boost and the Eurovision Song contest was the way they did it.

No less a Dictator that Josef Stalin was quoted to say about Intervision (The Soviet Bloc version) and Eurovision ‘It is NOT THE VOTES THAT COUNT, BUT THE PEOPLE COUNTING THAT VOTE’ So true but despite countries now voting in a cell phone interactive age for there near neighbours the show survives, a show which has out lived many of the Europian Dictators and others who wished it was dead.  A show that continues to inspire hope, peace, freedom and music in every country who takes its (free to air) 4 hour long marithon final show.

The rest as they say is History, and perhaps now legend…  Enjoy the show for this documentary is one heck of ride, it really does cover SEX and Rock N Roll, Oh and a fair bit of the events which shaped Europe over the past 60 odd years.

ISO Disc Image.   Quality as original DVD Source.  The Eurovision shots are from Australian TV and look to me like they just streamed them from U TUBE..  so much for professional broadcasters.  I have better quality in my collection but C'est La Vie... Oh one more hit from Eurovision ooops sorry."
