The Eurovision Song Contest is the WorldΓÇÖs LARGEST Entertainment Event, seen in over 142 countries LIVE, people in Australia and New Zealand for example watch Eurovision at 7am in the Morning perfect for a beach party, well any excuse right.  Forget about the X Factor or xxx Got TalentΓÇª this is IT!

ON a personal level I have hosted ΓÇÿEurovision Song contestΓÇÖ house parties in the UK, Australia, Canada and the Falkland Islands as well as out at sea on an Oil Tanker.   If you want fun, social comment, not too serious music and a party, well 'come on over' and tune in.  Sorry but Nashville does not seem to want to play this gig.  Perhaps a little too close to revolution for middle America????

In recent years countries from the former Eastern Soviet Block have won most of the glory, but just 2 years ago Germany won it back.   Eurovision has lived through the re drawing of the social, economic and political struggles and the show very much reflects that.   From an impoverished East Germany to a united powerhouse with east and west joined together again.   Eurovision was launched back in the days of the Sputnik, the Worlds first satellite launched in triumph by the Soviet Union.

By the late 1960ΓÇÖs the people of the Eastern Block were wanting to be free, but the Soviets had enough tanks to keep them back, but the Soviet Union was losing the cultural revolution in Popular Music which was being promoted in the West, and People were tuning in all over Europe not only to this annual show, but to all the West's networks had to offer.  British and American Forces Radio broadcasts were especially popular.

Eurovision however was making an impact as the TV viewerΓÇÖs numbers grew, and grew.   Winners put their countries on the World Stage, and they got to host the show, a great event and showcase for tourism (something else which has grown and grown).
