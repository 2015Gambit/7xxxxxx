Masterchef Allstars Season 1 Episode 7

All your favourite MasterChef contestants from seasons past, return to the MasterChef kitchen for the first ever MasterChef All Stars.

It wouldnΓÇÖt be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George.

Paired with one of Australia's best chefs, the All Stars must cook-off against their top chef for the chance to gain immunity and avoid tomorrow night's pressure test. 

Enjoy!
