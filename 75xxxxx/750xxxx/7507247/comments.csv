,DaYgon76,2012-08-06T13:11Z,"After 2.5 hours to download, uploader used FMP4 codec AGAIN not Xvid as stated in description, which won't play on DVD player. Thanks for the upload but please if ripping to avi use xvid codec like everyone else otherwise might as well be H264."

,vatel88,2012-08-06T14:57Z,@Daygon title says xvid but the description  says mp4 so all i can say is learn to read because people make mistakes sometimes (we are human beings and fallible) and its always a good idea to cya and double check any information you ever see. Taking things as face value and proceeding accordingly can get you hurt or worse.
,dubblue4,2012-08-06T15:16Z,thanks
,uheardmebitch,2012-08-06T15:35Z,cheers!

Actually I did read the description and it reads ""Codec ID = Xvid"" which is what you need to look at. Others torrents of this particular downloader have stated that the codec is FMP4 and that is fine. The FORMAT is MPEG-4 which IS NOT an Mp4 file. The Avi container can use MPEG-4 format and usually does. In this case the uploader has not used the Xvid codec but instead has used the FMP4 codec. This seems to be regular for this uploader when everyone else uses Xvid, which is why I placed the comment as alot of people play on DVD player and not PC hence this won't play on most older DVD players.

,DaYgon76,2012-08-06T16:31Z,Sorry Uploader not Downloader. Because people make mistakes!
,guarino2002,2012-08-06T17:50Z,Would not play on the 360 video player. Great movie and quality overall though. 
,capitan_hook,2012-08-06T18:35Z,"hei comment on the quality of the video audio, who cares about the codec dont you know how to use a video converter to make it dvd compatible..."
,boygalang0806,2012-08-06T23:05Z,Thanks!
,J3rryKo42O,2012-08-07T00:01Z,"@DaYgon76
why don't you just upgrade your old ass shit. 
anyone who isn't using a laptop connected to their flatscreen with hdmi, is basically living in the dark ages. fuck converting movies and to HELL with burning dvds. "
,J3rryKo42O,2012-08-07T00:06Z,"@DaYgon76 

ps if it took you 2.5 hours to download this....thats just sad

upgrade your dusty ass internet before you bitch at what other people do FOR FREE. 

took me less then 15 minutes to download this shit and before you bitch again i barely have highspeed. "
,vampzcore,2012-08-07T02:20Z,thanks!!
,DaYgon76,2012-08-07T06:58Z,"@J3rryKo42O
Your an idiot.
the 2.5 hours was from lack of seeders.
Not wasting my time addressing anything else to you."
,cokes87,2012-08-07T15:38Z,How come when I play this it the video speeds through super fast but the audio plays normal. I tried it on 3 separate players and it does the same thing. 
,stumpybob,2012-08-07T17:34Z,"i don't really care about the codecs and format and all that techie crap, i just would like to know is the juice worth the squeeze? How good is this flick? anyone? "

,klownkillah,2012-08-08T06:10Z,"I cannot get this to play on my VCR!!!

I did think about converting it to DVD but it clearly states VHS in the title and others have already reported issues converting to to DVD... so yeah.... i think i will just play it on the computer :)"
,IRISHMAN65,2012-08-08T12:23Z,"im just thankful for the time and effort the up-loader put into the movie. thank you Hackubus!

,makpirat,2012-08-09T21:54Z,this movie is crap. Ive watched it from begining to the end and it stinks. there are short horror movies with home made cameras un home made special effects.
,Daedric_Overlord,2012-08-10T08:37Z,"I've noticed this will not play on my PS3, due to ""Unsupported Data"", I'm just curious as to what format this actually is, and what I need to convert it to, to make it work, without audio problems and such. Also, if anyone could tell me a reliable free converter that I could use, without watermarks and such, that would be extremely helpful, thank you for your time."
,82bear,2012-08-10T13:54Z,"Great Film, Enjoyed it immensely.

The quality was great all though at times it didn't matter because you were watching a ""tape"".

,rem308,2012-08-12T03:59Z,"10/10 movie is supposed to be grainy.  As a fan of both good and cheesy horror movies i like this one as far as ""handheld cam"" movies go."
,weirwolfe,2012-08-13T09:31Z,Thanks uploader. Great torrent. Great movie.
