Out of the North Bend hinterland comes the Little Black Bottles, a true Cascadian rock country experience. Founded by Jackie and Myke Fedyk as a two piece, LBB has taken their rollicking, ukulele-driven tavern sound and blown it out into a signature style with wide ranging influences.

Their horror/scifi/literature inspired songs segue fluidly from the ripping guitar of ΓÇ£The Devil Takes a GirlΓÇ¥ to the sweet sentimentality of ΓÇ£Zombie RomanceΓÇ¥ to the circus dementia ΓÇ£Jimmy the Hideous Penguin BoyΓÇ¥.

Playing throughout the Northwest since 2008, LBB has completed their debut EP, Werewolf of Moncton. The bandΓÇÖs upcoming full-length album, Let Them Eat Red Velvet Cake, blends JackieΓÇÖs country-tinged vocals and clever lyrics with MykeΓÇÖs deft arrangements to generate an energetic, memorable album worth the wait. With standout tracks like ΓÇ£Unlucky in Love,ΓÇ¥ it wonΓÇÖt be long before theyΓÇÖre dominating the radio far and wide, haunting the airwaves like a shadow with a pompadour.
