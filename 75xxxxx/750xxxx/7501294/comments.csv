[H],HeroMaster,2012-08-03T21:08Z,Seed and ENJOY!
,SD1000,2012-08-03T21:41Z,great thanks! Been waiting for a skull-uploader! But it doesn't require 1.7 patch does it?
,OmegaHax,2012-08-03T21:43Z,is it working ?
,dj500,2012-08-03T21:46Z,What about the 1.7 patch? Will Dawnguard work without it? In Fallout DLCs didn't work without the latest patch before them.
,jakey4556,2012-08-03T21:49Z,Downloading now. Will seed for a bit afterwards too. My PC sucks at seeding but I'll do my best for as long as I can 
,GoToHell11,2012-08-03T21:51Z,"Hey HeroMaster tnx for the upload,i was just wonderin is the update 1.7 included with this expansion pack?"
,SFRA,2012-08-03T22:01Z,Does the game need to be patched and cracked to the latest version to play this? If yes has the newest version been cracked yet?
,xxacolytexx,2012-08-03T22:09Z,hope this one works...
,IndigoAK,2012-08-03T22:19Z,"You do need the latest patch.  If you have a legal copy of the game, you do not need to crack it to play this DLC, even with Steam.  Just drop and play.  You can even unlock the achievements."
,corei7,2012-08-03T22:39Z,"I never really post, but the way I got this to work was going to www. 4shared .net and searched for skyrim update 10.   I promise that I'm not spamming.  All the other updates for this game on here would make the game crash for me as soon as I got remotely close the the quest marker for the dlc."
,SD1000,2012-08-03T23:09Z,"Yup, needs the patch....

Corei7 are you sure? What language do you play in?"
,SFRA,2012-08-03T23:30Z,"@corei7

thanks man. it works now.

 i didnt know how to get the dawnguard quest started at first. but you just need to go into one of the major cities and a guy named durak will approach you and start the whole quest."
,SFRA,2012-08-03T23:31Z,"Oh and heres the link to the skyrim update 10 for everyone. 

www mediafire com/?5dimnw1yd8hv9td

You need to overwrite the files in the Skyrim directory in order to play this DLC."
,corei7,2012-08-03T23:34Z,"@SD1000, English.  "
,corei7,2012-08-03T23:36Z,"@SFRA, I was trying to post another comment with that exact link but kept getting ""Database error"" issues lol"
,xxacolytexx,2012-08-03T23:39Z,just finished dling :P now seeding
,xxacolytexx,2012-08-04T00:23Z,tested on and with cracked skyrim and worked 100% thx :)
,asafmiara,2012-08-04T00:45Z,dj500 dont worry i playing just fine with update 9 you dont need update 10 its working just fine
,xxacolytexx,2012-08-04T00:51Z,"crossbow on 3rd person view is glitched, anyone else got same problem?"
,patdafireman,2012-08-04T00:57Z,Please Seed :D thx for the torrent will seed
,r083r73h,2012-08-04T01:17Z,Works like a charm. Thanks Hero. 
,aJaKz,2012-08-04T01:53Z,"Anybody else getting animation errors when they transform into the Vampire Lord? Like the hands and body remain at an idle pos. instead of having the spells readied, or the claws out when you land? All I can do is move around, yet no animations work."
,aJaKz,2012-08-04T02:10Z,"Is anyone else getting animation issues with the Vampire Lord form? after you transform I cannot do anything but ""slide around"" and theres no animation for the movement, attack type transition, etc etc. 
**Sorry for a double, comment is vanishing, damn laggy PB"
,corei7,2012-08-04T03:03Z,"I'm having my first issue so far with the dlc.  When you get to the point of taking the form of the Vampire Lord for the first time, I select it from my magic stuff but when I press the button to transform, my guy does nothing.. Any suggestions? "
,aJaKz,2012-08-04T06:37Z,"@corei7 same problem here, no fix yet, but im searching around downloading a different version of Dawnguard hoping that maybe a non-compressed version will fix the animation issues. Will report back later, if no fix becomes present...then Im saying fuck it and going to AvP (2010 edition)"
,thaddeus12,2012-08-04T07:20Z,did anyone else game mess up after downloading dawnguard then saving and quiting then the launcher shows that you have no mods installed and the game won't start? Because it just happened and it never has before until i played with the new dawngaurd 
,QbertTK,2012-08-04T07:28Z,It's evidently not compatible with the Steam version of the game. Gives the ScriptDragon error.
,naff99,2012-08-04T09:14Z,"Thank you for your upload. For people with a legitimate copy of the game, like myself, just drop both files in the Skyrim data folder.  Steam/Steamapps/common/skyrim/data"
,usoppusama,2012-08-04T09:43Z,Seed you fuckers!
,Interregnum,2012-08-04T20:00Z,Dont forget to get update 10 for this! 
,DipShiz,2012-08-04T20:24Z,So after patching 1.7 and placing Dawnguard in the correct location. It still wont play. Nothing showing up in my Data Files. Anyone else having this problem? I am using Kaos version. Was wondering if that had anything to do with it.
,lamer_gamer,2012-08-04T23:03Z,"Hey, I downloaded the torrent and the update 10. I can still play the game, but not the DLC. When I hit the launcher, it doesn't give me the option to check the data files. I pasted them into the Skyrim data directory.  not playing on a steam copy. Help?"
,raiannub,2012-08-06T02:06Z,"Ai galera, pra quem n茫o conseguiu por o DLC pra funcionar. E s贸 colar os arquivos na pasta do diretorio do jogo em DATA, e ir e documentos e My GAMEs e SKIRIM e abrir ela e  editar o arquivo que esta .TXT ponha essa palavra exatamente depois do Launcher ""bEnableFileSelection=1"". "
,RanY2jith,2012-08-06T03:28Z,"For the dumbfuckers who cannot get shit working, download the update here www mediafire com/?5dimnw1yd8hv9td and then activate the DLC in data and talk to a guard in the city and then your DLC starts."
,lxXProtoXxl,2012-08-06T10:03Z,"Thanks naff99 for clarifying. 20 for a dlc thats not that big is a bit over the top not pricy for me, just not going to support that price. A couple of Dawnguard dlcs have been floating around tpb but i trust hero more than those others. Thanks HeroMaster."
,Ign0tus,2012-08-06T10:15Z,"What I'm wondering is why are there 5 different versions of Dawnguard on TPB with sizes ranging from 569 MiB up to 1.38 GiB. I've seen comments on every torrent saying that it works. Why do they have such different file sizes? This one is 1.13 GiB and apparently doesn't include patch 10/1.7. I assume the 569 MiB doesn't either, but that's a big disparity in file size."
,Dbunker09,2012-08-06T15:35Z,okay so i have gone to all the cities and i cant get the quest to start. i have put the files in the data folder and read comments updated to 10 and i can not still get this to activate the quest. Any hints or what am i missing
,OmniNegro,2012-08-06T16:42Z,"Sizes change drastically with different methods of compression. Just because the archive may be a zip or rar, that in no way means there is only one method to use for each of them. You have hundreds of methods. 

Typically we use rar with maximum compression and the largest dictionary size to compress the data. Doing the same sort of compression with arc and/or arj may actually take hours even on a modern system.

So we use different methods to compress based upon not only how long it will takes the end user on a netbook to decompress, but also the much greater amount of time it will take the poster to compress it in the first place.

Doubt me? Try extracting and compressing with different tools and methods. Record the amount of time and the file sizes. You will see.

Cheers."
,DipShiz,2012-08-06T18:11Z,"Alright so I am back again with the same problem. I patched from 1.7 to 10. Copied the Rar listed on here into the main folder. Moved dawnguard into the data folder, and still cannot click on my data files. Am I the only person using Kaos version of the game? If so does anyone have another version that will work with this dlc?"
,lxXProtoXxl,2012-08-07T01:30Z,"@DipShiz you can buy it, its on sale you know."
,DipShiz,2012-08-07T01:48Z,Herpa Derp. Let me be a jackass on the internet because it's funny. Yes. I know I can buy the game. This clearly isn't a retail site. So please. Unless you wish to help stfu.
,lamer_gamer,2012-08-07T10:06Z,"@DipShiz
Had the same problem. went outside tpb for answers and it's apparently more common than I thought. Didn't have to look far. You have to edit the SkyrimPrefs.ini in the directory. For me it was in the window before you go into the data folder in the skyrim folder. If that doesn't work then change the same file where the saves are stored.

You need to add this line of text:  bEnableFileSelection=1"
,laserboy15,2012-08-12T11:28Z,"I got it to download perfectly and checked it on my data files but when I try to start the game with Dawnguard checked it starts up for about 4 seconds and then closes itself without an error message or anything. It works fine if I uncheck its box though. Please help, i am really excited to play this."
,TheAHW,2012-08-16T10:23Z,"Well, I everything was fine for me until the game exited itself after I had put in Dawnguard. Damn. Same problem as laserboy15"
,kolfep,2012-08-19T16:11Z,"For those who can't select the data file on the launcher for enabling the DLC this is what you need to do:

Go to MyDocuments / MyGames / Skyrim and then open the SkyrimPrefs file. It'll open a notepad window. All you need to do now is find the Launcher section and type this under it: bEnableFileSelection=1
Save the file and start your game through the launcher. Data File should be enaled and you can enable the DLC by clicking on it.
Worked for me. Hope it does for you."
,NightNiix,2012-08-19T18:35Z,@kolfep I had that problem and did what you said. Now I can access the Data Files on Launcher but there is not anything there to check. It is blank. And the Dawnguard files are on my game data folder. Any ideia?
,GreekNuke,2012-09-02T14:36Z,same problem here.....i have download many files and i have seen in comments that for other ppl it works. But when i go to data on launcher there is no Dawnguard 
,Vari4t,2012-09-08T21:15Z,"You have to place it  after these files in your skyrimprefs.  They must be in that order.  

bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=4
bEnableFileSelection=1"
