[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-06T21:54Z,"this is real , if it wasn't then it would not be here."

,Anunn4ki,2012-08-06T22:25Z,The same keys work or have to wait out the crack?
[H],Chris-Aksel,2012-08-06T22:45Z,keys work only for install but you can't activate with these.
,topjimmy68,2012-08-06T23:24Z,"Found this in the comments of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7500071/WINDOWS_8_ENTERPRISE-N_RTM_X64_VOLUME_ENGLISH_BOOT_DVD_%5BThumperD

Open command promt as admin
If you are using Pro, type these lines ONE BY ONE!
slmgr -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato

If you are using Enterprise:
slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr /ato
slmgr /dli

For me, activation details shows ""Your license to use Windows expires on 2/2/2013""
Plenty of time for now, if this holds up."

,mswing777,2012-08-08T01:41Z,"The original KMS server was taken offline, but lucky, a new KMS server is online. I think this server is temporary as well, but here's the new activation method:

Run cmd.exe as Administrator
Enter these commands one by one:

For Win 8 Professional:

slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4

slmgr /skms 91.149.135.121

slmgr.vbs -ato


For Win 8 Enterprise:

slmgr /skms 91.149.135.121

slmgr.vbs -ato


Windows 8 Pro w/ WMC is still not supported so don't try, unless you want to reinstall Windows.

,FulcrumX,2012-08-18T04:19Z,"I successfully activated my W8 Enterprise by using the ff method:

Volume MAK Key for Enterprise VL
 PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C 

 How to activate your Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise:

 1. Run cmd as admin. Enter slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C (Only for Enterprise and Pro)
 2. Turn off your internet connection
 3. Open activation window and click ""Activate"". It'll show your an error.
 4. After that you'll see ""Activate by phone"" button.
 5.  i chose united kingdom for the country, Call microsoft and enter code from message, which you will see.
 6. you should choose for business, If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1

this should work and your w8 should be activated for good. goodluck!"
