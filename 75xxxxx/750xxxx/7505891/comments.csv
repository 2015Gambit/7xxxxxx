,flashfv,2012-08-05T13:42Z,I might add Medievil 2 on here soon or someone can request a game!
,dududus,2012-08-05T17:08Z,"I love this game so much

Sequel is even better!!

Why no Ps2 or Ps3 games, dumb Sony!"
,flashfv,2012-08-05T22:00Z,@dududus out of all the ps1 classics this game is probably the one I want most to get a remake or sequal on ps3! But not that we are getting close to ps4 years it might have to wait until then. Medievil 3 on ps4 will be the name I wish!
,flashfv,2012-08-05T22:02Z,@dududus I have part 2 but I have never played it before.
