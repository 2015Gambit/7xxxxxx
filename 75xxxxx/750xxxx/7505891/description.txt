
Medievil


You are Sir Dan, a recently reincarnated knight who has lost all 
that unsightly flesh i.e., you're a skeleton and you must battle 
the evil sorcerer Zarok and his battalions of undead monsters. To 
combat these baddies, you have your trusty sword, an axe, and a 
bow that shoots flaming arrows at the ready. But this game is more 
than just hack-and-slash action; each level has unique puzzles 
that differ from stage to stage, giving a nice degree of variety 
to the title. Also, once a certain number of enemies are dispatched, 
you can gather up a chalice that gives you access to the Hall of 
Heroes, a place where heroic ghosts distribute special weapons or 
items with each visit. Of course, these visits are usually 
accompanied by a verbal chastising at your unworthy status as the 
champion of Gallowmere. And while this game has plenty of action, 
it is also filled with bright and colorful graphics, and has a light 
feel that will appeal to younger gamers.
