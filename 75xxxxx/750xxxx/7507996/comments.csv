I just wanted to say how fantastic The Newsroom is.  Great new TV Show, quality HBO.  So maybe doesn't compare to Game of Thrones or The Wire but I'm loving it.  

Tried to get friends into it with little success (so far).  What put my friend off watching it was the trailers.  It's true thou, when you watch the catch up clip at the start of the show and the trailer for upcoming episodes it really focuses on the relationships and who kissed who and makes the show look like another U.S trash romance comedy.  When it leaves out brilliant scenes and moments which really make this show great.

If your unsure about giving The Newsroom ago remember it is HBO which I believe sets a standard of quality.  But also check out the first scene of the first episode, as well as the Jesus joke scene in episode 3 (both on Youtube) to see what moments your missing out on.

I post my fav clip for every week on Facebook just to try and get freinds to watch it. It's like when The Walking Dead came out I screamed and yelled but no one listened.  Now their all into it.  It's like the show The Killing by AMC.  Such a fantastic show but it hasn't had much success.  

I felt like rambling.  I rambled. Cheers."
,Merrrrr,2012-08-06T11:06Z,Oh Also as a side note.  If you like The Walking Dead.  Creator and writer Robert Kirkman is in the process of writing a new show for AMC based also on his and Nick Spenser's comic Thief of Thieves.  A non-linear storyline with heists and cons.
