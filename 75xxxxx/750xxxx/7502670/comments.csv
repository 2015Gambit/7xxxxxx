You are AWESOME."
,barkbosse,2012-08-04T18:10Z,"Sorry for asking a noob question. But what's with the repeating scenes? Is it just what it sounds like, i.e the same scene repeated sevetral times during the movie? If so, why? And why are they there if this is a bluray rip? Something wrong with the source?"

,Dgcz,2012-08-05T09:47Z,"@ barkbosse:
haven't downloaded this, but the reason for repating scenes is that the source was TV broadcast with commercials every 10 minutes: after the commercials, the film was not continued at the very same position where it was interrupted, but half minute before..."

,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-08T08:15Z,"WOW. Another Piece of TURD from Holly. Suddenly, Teen Choice Awards and Justin Bieber are looking more intelligent than Battleshits, Abraham and his Zombies, and this Turd. Should have given her some Lube in those parachutes, so she could finger herself once in a while which would have been more entertaining. People who write and direct this junk should be Jailed, Sued, and be made to a Public administered defecation in shame. How do these numbnuts get a job, while a decent working man can lose his job? WOW!"
,.Leto.,2012-08-08T17:33Z,"@ ChillyCrossFoot: wow, it seems you hated this piece of crap even more than I did :D
The most amazing thing is that this crappy movie made 672 millions $ worldwide, 405 millions $ in the USA alone! That's a lot of disappointed people: those who read and loved the books and were pissed off when they saw how pathetic and terrible the movie adaptation is and those who didn't read the books but thought that it was a good movie because everyone was talking about it.
At least we didn't pay for this!!"
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T00:48Z,"Leto. The world is being run by ""Legal"" Crooks. Just check out your ISP and TV Provider. Loads of Services they sell you, for shi.itty a*$ programming. While I have been looking for a job for 2 months, a decent honest hard working man. These crooks are running the world. It's a shame. But these crooks are not the problem. The problem are the people willing to buy this junk. The idiot is not the scammer, but the one who gets scammed. Abraham Lincoln and the Zombies? WOW! Lincoln would commit suicide if he could see the future and save the other guy the trouble. I am sorry, but my idea of Entertainment is not to mix it with ignorance. Things that make sense entertain me. Hollywood continues to insult my intelligence while children are getting dumber by the generation. "
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T01:00Z,"This rip does have a problem, however its not a big deal. The movie is the steamiest pile of dung I have ever laid eyes on. The Hunger Games is some type of rhetoric for If you're hungry, EAT Sh!T American dumb@$$es. Kids watch this crap, then think they know what LOVE is. I also love the ""Cold as a dead  bone"" attitude. Depression isn't because of lack of resources, its because of a lack of MENTAL resources. Holly's basically taken a concrete TURD in the shape of a baseball bat, to beat to a pulp what it presumes is my 2 cell powered brain. I pay enough to my ISP per month, which I consider payment to this junk anyway. If a movie or game is truly good, I pay for it, and consider it my gratitude. The whole schenanigans they show in the beginning of the movie, about how hard those people work, the lighting, staging, etc etc blah blah, they all got paid. Don't try to make me feel sorry for them. If I work an hourly job, I get paid by the hour, and so do they. The product is no longer important, the marketing is what sells TURDS. I can sell TURD if I market it right. I am angry, I lost 1.5 hours of my life."

,thereisnoother,2012-08-11T18:05Z,"I actually thought the repeated scenes were meant to be like that! There were only 2 or maybe 3 short clips that repeated and it seemed to be emphasizing a certain theme in the move.

Overall, best quality rip I have ever seen. Well done to this uploader. Usually rips lack the strength of the immersive surround sound experience on my high end 9.1 system, but not this one. Audio was superb and picture quality was very close to direct play from Blue Ray disk. As with any rip which has been compressed, the images are ever so slightly muted to the discerning eye, but hardly noticeable, even on a 58"" samsung plasma.
