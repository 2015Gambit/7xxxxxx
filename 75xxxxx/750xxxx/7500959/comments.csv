,candika12,2012-09-11T22:47Z,Hey bobiras2009 you linked this page as the version that does not need root? It still needs root from what i am seeing in the comments... What gives?
,candika12,2012-09-11T22:48Z,noob..
,j122068,2012-09-12T01:59Z,You said in your other upload for those of us who have a non rooted device to DL this instead. Are you just giving instructions on how to root and then how to install cause it seems you told someone that you would need root for this.
