,ben7530,2012-08-04T18:14Z,"@ PetaFlux: I initially thought that as well.

But after using it as a main OS for a while, my opinion has completely changed.

Win-8 Advantages:
--""Metro"" is just a pretty start menu
--Better keyboard shortcuts
--Natively Mount/Burn ISOs
--If you use the command line, ""copy as path"" is very easy now, when it was an arcane chore in Win7.
--Folder options are greatly improved: Many windows users I know had never even heard of ""invert selection"". Now it is a button of its own!
--Disk spanning/pooling to emulate a raid setup
--MUCH better search capability (still not up to OSX standards, though...)
--Performance. Win8 on an SSD boots in ~15 seconds, from power-on. That's including clicking on chrome. So power-off to web surfing in 15 sec. Also, every aspect of the older laptop I put 8 on is faster.
--VASTLY improved task manager!!
--VASTLY improved disk management tools. They even go so far as to detect SSDs and turn defragmenting off for them. You can also tell Win8 to TRIM, as opposed to just having to wait until Win7 idled long enough.

Metro is shocking, but if you've used windows long enough, it'll take you, eh, 48 hours to feel right at home."
,ringdots,2012-08-04T18:53Z,"@ben7530 I have used Metro on the DP, CP, and RP. Overall I have used it for way over 48 hours and... it still sucks. Windows 8 is awesome with the exception of Metro. Metro is great on a tablet or touchscreen btw but on my desktop the only think I want is the look of Windows 7 with the various improvements you made note of."

,ben7530,2012-08-04T21:02Z,"@ringdots: 

Yeah; metro does suck. No arguments. I use ""Start8"" by stardock, and just treat metro as an annoyingly flamboyant start menu. I agree Metro / ""apps"" have no place on the desktop, and would gladly go back to 7 in this respect.

However, I still view the ""positives"" of 8 as outweighing the ""OMG?WTF?!?!"" that is metro.

Uhm, have you noticed that this site you're on, the pirate bay, isn't exactly about ""buying"" things?

Have you even tried windows 8 for 2-4 days w/o going back to 7? Once you realize that Metro is just an annoyingly expanded start menu, then 8 beats 7 in most ways: It's faster on the same hardware than win7, it has a slew of new features (disk spanning, natively mount/burn ISOs, etc.)

You should do so before knocking it..."

,pfragment,2012-08-08T15:37Z,so is there a possibility that an activator will show up in the next 30 days? 
,-WallpaperZ-,2012-08-09T09:06Z,"Installed all good in VMWare Workstation 8 but I can't seem to get any network connections : I think its because it requires VMWare tools for this and VMWare still need to release an update for this. Ir maybe I am doing something wrong. 

P.S. thanks for the upload Thumper!"

,CrAcKeZ,2012-08-09T09:24Z,"@pfragment a 4GB usb stick will work. Just format it into NTFS filesystem with 4K cluster size(default one) and throw all the files in.

It worked for Win7, I don't see why it wouldn't for Win8."
,-WallpaperZ-,2012-08-09T09:29Z,I apologize...all VMWare users need to install this in the VM as a Windows 7 x64 Machine...then let VMWare tools install for all your virtual network connections and sound drivers :)
,CrAcKeZ,2012-08-09T10:07Z,"I installed this to test the OS, oh boy it really sucks.. as consumer preview I've tested in the past

I found many restrictions compared to Win7.."
,richardalan1975,2012-08-09T14:48Z,"I signed up to say THANK YOU ! The OS is fantastic, there are no limitations aside from the N version not having the media player.  This is the full retail release.  I was having issues activating but in time I eventually caught the activation server online and did so with the info below.  Looks like I am good through FEB 2013

For Win 8 Enterprise:
 slmgr /skms 91.149.135.121
 slmgr.vbs -ato"

,wreck1080,2012-08-13T22:31Z,"WARNING::The torrent description says the CRC32 is 4517C22E. But the actual CRC32 of this download is 6575873a .

Check it yourself. Download hashcalc  (or other) and verify the image CRC. 

SO the image has been modified from the official version. Why would anyone do that? My bet is that it is infected by malware.    

Another commenter asked for the reason for this, but thumper did not answer this important question. 

Again, ThumperTM, any reason for the hash discrepancy?

I have windows 7 x64 ultimate installed. But when I tried to upgrade to this edition of windows 8 it says ""Windows 7 Ultimate cannot be upgraded to Windows 8 Enterprise N.""

,RPD452,2012-08-16T07:22Z,So does anyone have any clue as to if or when more KMS servers are going to be online? 
,TheNemmy,2012-08-16T11:01Z,"@shnky90

It can't be upgraded on N edition you need to do a fresh install, I did the same, just extract the ISO to your D or any other partition and run the setup from there and install in c drive then when it installs remove windows.old directory..

and I used KMS activator torrent and I have reigstered windows till 2013... lolz"
