This time Max and Stacy discuss artificial superstition, increasing the inflation target to 100% and suicide watch for the too big to fail banks. They also discuss HSBC's misselling of interest rate swaps and drug cartel money laundering. In the second half, Max interviews author and blogger, James Howard Kunstler of Kunstler.com, about walking on coal and waiting for Santa Claus with Paul Krugman's magical thinking.
