,lu_fer,2012-08-06T15:43Z,"Best till now, great quality."
,riot-transylvania,2012-08-06T18:17Z,Thank you so much!!!!!
,el-grey,2012-08-07T01:35Z,"Can you  upload a DVD5 Bluray rip, 4,36 G. whit English audio 448 kbps??? None has uploaded yet."
,riot-transylvania,2012-08-07T17:48Z,"omg, great quality!
thank you soooo much!"
,coykoi,2012-08-07T22:38Z,"One of the best rips out there. I haven't tried the 9GB PublicHD one yet, but this is slightly better than the YIFY torrent, at the same size."
,casba1,2012-08-11T05:36Z,"This is a freaking AMAZING quality. IDK how is blu ray before it's out, but i sure believe it. Great torrent. Thanks!"
,ccoltmanm,2012-08-12T06:24Z,Does this version have 5.1 or 7.1? Or is it 2 channel audio?
,EchoVG,2012-08-12T09:41Z,Is this English audio?
,dr_huffrhurr,2012-08-14T07:26Z,"English audio.
2 channel output."
,dustyshot,2012-08-14T09:05Z,"Now see that is what I don't get. These bluray so called rips from bluray source are smaller than normal dvd rips. Seriously, how do you think it is better to have a better quality source than dvd smaller than dvd rips and say its better? I don't see the logic. Even if I had a tablet or ipod touch I still would not waste all that space on them just for these tiny size lower than 4 gig rips."
,dustyshot,2012-08-14T09:10Z,"If I watched this on my 17 inch laptop it would not compare to the rips I got that are 4 gigs or higher. I would not even bother with watching any rips on smaller screen. I am not a teeny bopper, maybe that all that downloads these little teensy weensy tiny video files."
,luvfree2012,2012-08-18T03:52Z,this is a great version if u wanna miss the last 23 minutes of the movie
,Gotarock,2012-08-24T23:00Z,"My Download Skipped Around A Lot About 1/4 The Way Through, I've Never Had A Problem With Any Of GlowGaze's Up's, Did Anyone Else Have This Problem??? It Would Have Been A Great Copy If Not For That Tho...."
,pockystixs,2012-08-26T02:30Z,freakin awesome dude *__*
,massarico,2012-08-26T15:24Z,"Thanks heaps for the upload.
Nice quality.

Thought the movie was going to be better tho."

The video is amazing but the audio is quite low. Doesn't matter much if you're watching on a TV but if you're watching it on a laptop it'll be hard to hear."
,mr2sweet1,2012-09-02T03:54Z,Great rip!!! Ty man you always have the best rips!!!
,whac,2012-09-03T06:18Z,It is possible to find something with sound? :(
,intrepid9,2012-09-03T19:34Z,"The audio is quiet and the subtitles keep displaying [GlowGaze.Com] in yellow... Very annoying. Video is good.

,forcrz6,2012-09-07T00:21Z,"Not bad video, audio sux. Looking at the MP4 that this is encoded in. 
Bit rate 95kbs
Channels  2(stereo)
48 kHz

I mean really only 2 channel? Sorry but that is a major deduction.

,oblio4,2012-09-11T01:42Z,"while MPC or VLC would play the subtitles, my Roku would not.  It turned out the problem was that on 6 or 8 random lines, there was a code
""GlowGaze.Com"" inserted, followed by about 25 blank lines, between the subtitle number and time, and the text for the line.  Once these were edited out, the subtitles worked properly."
,oblio4,2012-09-11T01:45Z,"While VLC or MPC would play the subtitles, my Roku would not.  This turned out to be due to the random insertion in about 8 lines, of a fontcolor code, followed by about 25 blank lines, between the subtitle number and timing, and the dialog for the line.  After removing the codes and blank lines, the subtitles worked properly.
