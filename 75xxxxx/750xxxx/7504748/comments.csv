,dwiss,2012-08-05T11:22Z,"Since it's Enterprise, I know I don't need an install key, but what about activation?  Will a Win7 loader work on this?"
,2010kaiser,2012-08-05T14:07Z,"dwiss

Win7 loader won't work on Win8. It's a trial and you'll need to re-arm it when the trial is about to expire. You do that by:
1. Open command prompt
2. Type:

slmgr /rearm 

3. Hit enter."
,Kenzeira,2012-08-06T02:00Z,"Since this is the non-N version, have this the Windows Media Center and Windows Media Player?"
,2010kaiser,2012-08-06T14:33Z,"Yes it has Media Player. Not sure about media center.
remember this will only give 5 re-arms and then it will start re-booting every 30mins approx.
People saying that you can re-arm 1000 times and such are incorrect."

Open command promt as admin
If you are using Pro, type these lines ONE BY ONE!
slmgr -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato

If you are using Enterprise:
slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
slmgr /ato
slmgr /dli

For me, activation details shows ""Your license to use Windows expires on 2/2/2013""
Plenty of time for now, if this holds up. "
