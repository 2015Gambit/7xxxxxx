Other Comments: Do not forget to make Dua' (supplication) of our fellow Muslims who are oppressed worldwide.

 

Narrated Anas: Allah's Apostle said, "Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one. People asked, "O Allah's Apostle! It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?" The Prophet said, "By preventing him from oppressing others."  


 
Asalaam alaykum.
