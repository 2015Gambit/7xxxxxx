One of the original cast members of the revolutionary sketch comedy show SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, John Belushi remains one of its best. Long after his tragically premature death from a heroin overdose, Belushi is remembered for the aggressive, physically erratic style of comedy he perfected while on the show, the highlights of which are collected here. From 1975 to 1979, Belushi developed characters such as the Samurai warrior, the short-order cook, and his unforgettable half of the Blues Brothers, a skit which was later turned into a feature film. Politically incorrect and fearless, Belushi set the stage for SNL, paving the way for its success over the next 30-plus years and leaving behind a revolutionary comedic legacy..
