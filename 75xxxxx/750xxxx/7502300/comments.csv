where they found a button..

the guy thinks it was planted

and talks about what nat geo didnt show them doing in the science part

goes to show nat geo editing is fooked up

about time these people dumped these media coys and do their own show and embrassed p2p to upload each episode and sell items and take donations to fund it.. so then ufo fams will support them 
and they can edit the investigations and show how its really done "
[V],psspss,2012-08-04T06:29Z,LOL embrace opps
,xpmule,2012-08-04T11:14Z,what guy thinks it was planted ?
[V],psspss,2012-08-04T11:32Z,"the guy that took them there as he scanned the site well before they arrived..

Im wondering though has anyone found the other spot where the ufo landed and hit the cliff
surely more debri on the hill/cliff it hit

the windmill is old news"
,xpmule,2012-08-05T02:58Z,ahh i c thanks for the reply
[V],psspss,2012-08-05T11:51Z,"everyone have a read of this

talks about gov using virus that maybe spying on you
and using your phones.. another good reason to have blue tooth always disabled like I do

[V],psspss,2012-08-06T02:38Z,"google is too useful though it indexes all the websites into a big database.. zena bytes? not terrabytes

sadly they ben recording ip for too long and know too much about me already to change"
[V],psspss,2012-08-06T02:39Z,a vpn and clearing cookies would stuff up google spying though as long as you dont use gmail and other services for mobile phone.. its too complicated not to leak real id at some point if use something they own

Fuck it i give up TPB is gay and won't let me make a simple comment again........................"
,xpmule,2012-08-06T22:11Z,just trying to ask for more info on ufo news videos. do they have a web site or something ?
,xpmule,2012-08-06T23:21Z,"found the source..
http://www.openminds.tv/spacingout/"
[V],psspss,2012-08-07T10:13Z,"tpb filters comments.. its weird though
some simple sentences it detects as some banned word and says db error as a default

guess they dont want to tell whats wrong so cant bypass it LOL

no I dont have a UFO website I just source the best on web and rip to xvids so people can add to their collections and properly other then via a stupid browser :)"
[V],psspss,2012-08-07T10:15Z,"opps missed a word.. and watch it properly
instead of a silly browser or flash player"
[V],psspss,2012-08-07T11:29Z,"so it was hacked and ddos by gov and now they
stolen the server

,xpmule,2012-08-07T15:21Z,"www savevid com for 720p from the source site links.

this comment crap is a nightmare !
i have no idea what words are tripping the filter.. I'm not saying anything unusual"
[V],psspss,2012-08-07T17:02Z,some web urls are banned.. like spam ones
,xpmule,2012-08-07T22:50Z,"basicly i was trying to say thanks for sharing even if you can find it elsewhere.
And that by doing what i said i could get a higher res etc"
[V],psspss,2012-08-08T03:59Z,"no the res is still 360p but mp4 variant or flash containers for some of the other stuff I bundle

most want xvid on my channel  cos mp4 dont play

and if you want to save your better to install downloadhelper plugin for firefox then you can use the sphere icon on status to say any non encrypted video

however encrypted you need a better tool like tubedigger"
[V],psspss,2012-08-08T04:13Z,"i mean save not say LOL -- tired.. another late night bed at 5am and up at noon :)'

some of the stuff takes some time to convert as you get the annoying VBR and audio drifts so doing it yourself may not be plain sailing.. sometimes aspect is off.. and nothing you can do with the video conference ones jerking sadly.. openmindstv needs a better way to interview :)"
