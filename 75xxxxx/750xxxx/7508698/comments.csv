P.S. - another comment from a person with ZERO uploads... Who is a cop here?!

If you are afraid of legal repercussions, don't download,  if my torrents are being tracked has nothing to do with me, believe me. I'm sure others are being tracked too.

,EpyxZ,2012-08-13T04:03Z,Appreciate the upload but we need a common naming convention. This is actually episode 7 if your going with all the other uploads (magically episode 8 comes out on nntp and torrent on aug 6th. again if you have been following eztv etc this is episode 7 fyi)
