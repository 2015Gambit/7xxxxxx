,Jerg12,2012-08-06T05:13Z,FAKE Don't Download! Too many files for ONE TV show. Also doesnt even have the show in it. Just a sample!
,cock_pig,2012-08-06T05:14Z,"the person who posted this sucks his dads 1"" cock"
,MalikeW,2012-08-06T05:18Z,Maybe sceneline got hacked.

,jennysaysfu,2012-08-06T05:26Z,A bit disappointed in your sceneline
,ZuZusPetals,2012-08-06T05:27Z,thats odd Jerg12. sceneline is usually a VERY reliable source.
,amandapants,2012-08-06T05:27Z,The reason there are so many files is because its an .rar file.... 
,phantomSG,2012-08-06T05:31Z,"fake, fake, and double fake. So why so many people falling for it. . . ."
[T],theburningbush,2012-08-06T05:34Z,"How do you figure this is fake, newbie? It's sceneline with a green skull...good enough for me. Just cuz yr too lame to handle RARs, don't blame sceneline."

,Jerg12,2012-08-06T05:38Z,Actually no. I dont handle anything that doesnt have only 1-3 files. 50 files is a little obnoxious. 
,ZuZusPetals,2012-08-06T05:48Z,If you guys just wait a bit longer(maybe another hour or two?) someone will post a 300MB version soon I'm sure....
,Drew4201,2012-08-06T06:02Z,"If there are 50 rar files, thats a good thing.  Chances are this is real.  Skull also says this uploader is  legit."
,SystemFolder,2012-08-06T10:12Z,"I downloaded this and unrared it after watching this episode on TV. Even though it is rared, it is still very real and absolutely NOT fake.

Notes defending a few points made by other comments:
Sceneline releases are rared and include a sfv (checksum) file for your protection so you know the share has not been modified throughout its trip from the DVR to you.

Sceneline uses a technique, built into many torrent clients, called ""super-seeding"" (or initial seeding) which minimizes the load on the original seed and creates multiple seeds more quickly."
,SystemFolder,2012-08-06T10:24Z,"After watching this episode on TV, I downloaded this  and unrared it. It is definitely the real episode and NOT fake.

Notes about some other comments:
Sceneline releases are rared and include a sfv (checksum) file for your benefit so you know the realese has not been modified during its trip from the DVR to you; other than trimming commercials of course.

Sceneline uses a technique, included in many torrent clients, called ""super-seeding"" (or initial seeding) which reduces the load on the original seed and creates multiple seeds more quickly and efficiently than normal seeding."
