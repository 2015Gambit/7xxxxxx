         Restoration         Version 2.5.14         5/14/2002
=======================================================================

[Description]
 Restore files which are deleted from the recycle bin or deleted while
 holding down the Shift key by mistake.
 Conversely, this program has another function that makes it almost
 impossible to restore all deleted files.
 You can use it after deletion of confidential documents, embarrassing
 files and so on.

 You don't have to install it, so it doesn't leave any garbage in the
 PC.
 (You can also run it from a floppy disk.)
 Even if a file seems to be restored, there is no guarantee that the
 contents are correct.
 After you run the program, please check the files.
 You can probably restore it correctly if the drive has enough free
 space
 and if it's just after deletion.
 If you restore a folder, there is no guarantee that all files or
 folders which used to belong to the folder will be in it.
 If you can't find them in it, please search and restore them one by
 one.
 If you still can't find them, it's impossible to restore them.
 It will be almost impossible to restore any deleted files if you run
 the complete deletion function.
 To be exact, fragments of deleted files can be in last clusters of
 existing files or allocated and unwritten files.
 (Note that this function is not suitable for TOP SECRET information.)
 Even if you find the information of completely deleted files, their
 contents must be erased.
 If you want to erase the information too, please run the function
 again.

Thank you for downloading and don't forget to seed :)
