,djnv2010,2012-08-10T06:42Z,any chance of the first Orcs game being uploaded?
,najor66,2012-08-23T15:03Z,"Thanks for the app and making it so unbelievably small!

But I am having a problem with the app: the textures that made up the monsters are all became white. Instead of seeing monsters I saw white colored orcs!

I'm using Radeon HD  6570 with the latest Catalyst on a Windows 7 64-bit.

Anyone else having the same problem?

Better yet, can anyone help?

Many thanks."
