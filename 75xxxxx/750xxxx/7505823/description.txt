I used for work tracks Machinae Supremacy (in FLAC) loaded from What.CD and also Britney Spears and Lady Gaga records in the multitrack format (in Wave). Tracks were mixed in the Adobe Audition 3.0. You can estimate quality of tracks on the spectrums enclosed by me. In other words, I forced Britney Spears and Lady Gaga to sing their songs together with Machinae Supremacy. I had to reduce a track "Paparazzi" because texts of performers after the first couplet differ.
