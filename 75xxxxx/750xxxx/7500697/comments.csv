,Nimh,2012-08-03T17:32Z,"WHAT HAPPENED??? 

Seriously, where the hell is Wilfred & Louie?? 
Of millions that watched you're the only one to upload it so far????? 

Thanks"
,Nimh,2012-08-03T17:41Z,"Look at all my peers from all over the world, 

Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Mexico, Germany, Denmark, Australia, etc    

ALL waiting for Louie, and noones bothered to upload it before you.   Fucking hopeless. (not you , the other basterds)"
,pc-Gnome,2012-08-03T17:49Z,"This is a singular event:

#1 - HoodBag (UseNet)
#2 - MP4SUX (UseNet & TPB)
and coming in a distant third (ending the siege)
#3 - EVOLVE (Scene)"
,xminus1,2012-08-03T17:52Z,"Wow, this is a relief!  Thank you for proving that the Internet, unlike societies in general, has a conscience.

Double thank you for the work and the share."
,gilknut,2012-08-03T18:05Z,"Anyone know WHY Louie and Wilfred were so delayed? Never happened before, as far as I can remember. Felt like the Internet was broken there for a while. :D"
,pc-Gnome,2012-08-03T18:05Z,"My best guess is LOL & Scene don't like criticism and decided to teach the whole community a lesson by withholding product from the addicts.

Their plan seems to have proved they are NOT the only game in town.

Spread the word!"
,gilknut,2012-08-03T18:51Z,"That's hilarious. :D Yes, I'm happy to see that plain failed. And thx to everyone who stepped in. "
,spifkitten99,2012-08-03T20:15Z,"Fuck the scene. They are pathetic crybabies.

They steal copyrighted material and share it (thanks), but then they expect to pretty much copyright it themselves, by making rules for how their torrents can be used.

Fuck them. Get out of the filesharing ""business"", if you don't like your work to be taken and used."
