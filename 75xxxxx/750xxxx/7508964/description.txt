Masterchef Allstars Season 1 Episode 8

All your favourite MasterChef contestants from seasons past, return to the MasterChef kitchen for the first ever MasterChef All Stars.

It wouldnΓÇÖt be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George.

An old classic, the Beef Wellington is a complex dish with a number of pressure points, but it must be cooked perfectly if the All Stars are to avoid elimination. 

Enjoy!
