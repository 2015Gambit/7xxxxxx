,paul211b,2012-08-07T14:16Z,Please can someone tell me why the audio is rubbish stereo only. People giving his torrents A10 are crazy. A bluray rip needs 5 channel sound or what's the point?
,dandalis,2012-08-07T15:46Z,how is the audio ?
,mirceab210,2012-08-07T18:35Z,nice:d  but please  SEED!!!!
,peterparkerdatsme,2012-08-07T22:25Z,"@paul211b : Probably because people are happy with a good rip at only 1.5 GB..?

1920 x 1080 with 5.1 ch audio encoded at a super high bit-rate would come in at 10+ GBs.
This one had .dts audio so I'm sure it's 5.1 (have fun downloading 8GBs)

YIFY for president! :)"
,8ax_,2012-08-17T13:26Z,"@paul211b

Because his movies are already very low bitrate, ~900 kbps for 720p and ~2000kbps for 1080p, there would be a big loss in quality with, for example, AC3 448kbps.
However, he could add HE-AAC 5.1 160kbps in his future 1080p releases."
