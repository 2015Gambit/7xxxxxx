,PIRATE300,2012-08-06T22:29Z,are you doing 1080p for this ?
,andyrodd,2012-08-06T23:08Z,"You are totally right,but a few more mega bytes won't hurt.in my humble opinion it will make the audio overall quality a little more better.Thank You again and i wish you do not get me wrong."
,darkphobos,2012-08-07T03:45Z,"Good quality, fast download.  Thanks, will seed overnight."
,Dolmish,2012-08-07T19:23Z,Are there repeated scenes in this rip to as the yifi release?
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-08-07T19:41Z,"@darkphobos 

Hey cant you read: ""RERIP"" it is in the title! 
Thats means no problems."
,989518,2012-08-08T20:07Z,how could there be a Blu-Ray rip when the DVD/Blu-Ray hasn't been released yet?
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-08-08T20:22Z,@989518 Thats the beauty with piracy it pure magic :)
,noturmom,2012-08-09T15:44Z,a10 v 10   great great download...movie 6...super fast too
,bubai999,2012-08-10T08:32Z,"Thank you.. :) It's a Re-RIP so, hopefully it won't have any repeated scenes :)"
,nekroto,2012-08-10T12:53Z,"@989518
I was wondering the same few years ago.
It goes like this
You have the official release date 18 August. Pirates usually get it 10 days before the official release date. How is that possible? Well, even though the official release date is 18 August, stores actually have the blu ray and dvd discs 2 weeks before the official release date. So I'm guessing the pirates have a deal/are friends with the store clerks and that's how they get it."
,SmittyB,2012-08-13T06:42Z,"Solid audio and video, thanks for the upload!"
,rudintor,2012-08-16T05:50Z,tnx zen_bud...fast download...MABUHAY!
,Chill999,2012-08-16T23:51Z,"Kudos man, this is the best torrent I've found of the Hunger Games. Fast download speed, great quality, and small size. No clue why this doesn't have as many seeders as the crappy rips with repeat scenes but whatever. Keep up the awesome work! A: 9 V:9 M:9 WILL SEED!"

,MAX_PAiN,2012-08-21T15:54Z,"Thanks a lot

I think the video bit rate is small a little

But we always waiting 4 ur great rips"
,ChasUGC,2012-08-21T23:58Z,"Noob info - TPB gets it faster because stores in other countries release at earlier dates than the US release date.  Sweden might get it three weeks before the U.S., and then it is ripped in Sweden and uploaded to TPB, two weeks before the U.S. release date."
,singeasy5,2012-08-24T05:44Z,Thanks
,etph,2012-08-25T06:49Z,Greate quality. Thanks a lot.
,xyphyll,2012-08-25T11:02Z,"Absolutely stunning quality. I'm just watching from the preview, but it looks like there aren't going to be any skips. Amazing how it's such a small file, yet amazing quality. 

Definitely will be seeding for a solid month."
