,tmcmahon51,2012-08-08T11:03Z,"Same issue as mussakhan. I disconnected net, blocked inbound and outbound connection both executables, and today when I went to start up Action!, it said the key was blacklisted."
,FIBu,2012-08-08T14:57Z,well-tried. key efficient in the 100%
,deiog,2012-08-09T00:20Z,"It's a damn shame the key was blacklisted.
Anyone know a way around this? Blocking the application files was a failure with both outbound and inbound connections.
I even tried to remove all traces using Revo Uninstaller, but the application still blacklisted the key.
Any solutions?"
