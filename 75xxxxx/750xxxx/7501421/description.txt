For every one of the last 20 years, The Dead Girls Feast has been celebrated in a small riverside community in the upper part of the Negro River. The occasion commemorates the ingenuous miracle that was performed by THE SAINT, a soon local boy who, soon after suffering his mothers suicide, recovered the shredded and bloodstained remains of a missing girls dress from the fangs of a stray mongrel. The little girls remains were never found, but those of her dress Saints were enshrined to create in The Saints humble dwelling a place of worship and pilgrimage.

The practices of the cult and the annual feast evolved over the years into a huge enterprise, despite persistent objections from the dead girls brother, TADEU. These days, the inhabitants of nearby Amazon villages visit the small town on the holy day to worship, pray and beg, as they anxiously await the girls revelations, which are to be channeled by The Saint.

The Saints FATHER is eager to exploit every opportunity to profit from the event and from his sons growing reputation in the region, even as he carries out a casually incestuous relationship with his son. The devout AUNTIE lives as a surrogate mother in service to The Saint and keeps her concerns about his doting private life a secret. The doting and sexy DAS GRAÃ‡AS and the young novice LUCIA do their best to maintain order and decency in the household shrine, which is given to occasional flare ups of madness.

On the day of the feast, Tadeu steps back into his role literally propping up the spellbound spellbound Saint through the procession to the riverside. A hush goes over the largest gathering ever as The Saint steps up to the microphone to utter the Dead Girls annual message.
