,TheHopa1988,2012-08-16T23:57Z,"I found a solution to the memory leak of Prototype 2 !! if you have ATI Radeon graphic card download a software called Ati Tray tools install it then go to the 3D category you should find ""Flip Queue Size"" and set it to 1, if you have Nvidia then simply go to the control panel look for ""Pre Rendered Frames"" and set it to 1 !! i tried it and it works fine now exept for some loss of FPS but the game is still playable "
