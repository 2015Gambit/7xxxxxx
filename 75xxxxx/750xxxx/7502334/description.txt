Gore Vidal (1925ΓÇô2012) never lacked for labels: Witty, irreverent, and shrewd, a propagandist, a truth-teller, and an agent provocateur. Dramatist, novelist, screenwriter, actor, and public debater. A troublemaker at large, poking his pen at anyone who got in his way. ThatΓÇÖs how Vidal seared himself into the American consciousness.

In THE EDUCATION OF GORE VIDAL, a broad cast of interviewees illuminates VidalΓÇÖs work, his life, his contradictions, and his ability to dramatize and animate history, while sticking to the truth.
