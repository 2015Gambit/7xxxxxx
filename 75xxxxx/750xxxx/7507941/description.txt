ADDITIONAL NOTES: 
This is the only available complete "In Utero" soundboard. It was broadcast
on Italian radio. There is a DAT recording available that was 
made from the radio broadcast, but I like the sound of the 
bootleg CD better. Some DJ banter has been cleverly edited 
out by the Italian bootleggers. I swapped the stereo image so that
Kurt is on the right and Pat is on the left, like on the official 
live releases.
