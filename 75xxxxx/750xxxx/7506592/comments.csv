,Irishbeast,2012-08-06T04:16Z,"I have a question. I DL a lot from here. Average of like 5-8 movies a week prolly. I am ever so grateful for what you Uploaders do and I love yall. 

My question is this: I want to be able to seed longer than i do but when my movies are finished I move them over to ""my videos"" folder on my comp. In order to do this it makes me ""STOP"" the seeding movie. Is there anyway I can move the file while still being able to move it and play it with VLC or WMP? Thanks for any help."
,Irishbeast,2012-08-06T04:25Z,Why did my question about transferring the file and still being able to seed get removed?

,FurTehLul,2012-08-06T05:57Z,"@Irishbeast, Just copy the movie instead of moving it. Click on it and do CTRL + C, and then go to the folder where you want to move it and press CTRL + V, or you can right click on the file, click copy, and then go to the folder where you want it and then right click and paste. 

Another way is just to simply change the DL folder for any specific torrent that way you don't have to have two copies of a movie sitting on your hard drive taking up twice the space. "

Great quality rip but this movie sucks big time!

I was hoping for something witty like in Borat.

It seems the targeted audience is mainstream morons.

As someone else commented, Sacha really jumped the shark on this one...

Please bring back the original Sacha, like in that hilarious skit where Ali G interviews Noam Chomsky."

The movie itself is kinda bad, maybe it's bad because I hoped something as good as Charlie Chaplin's ""The Dictator"". This movie seems more like a very Jewish-nationalistic pseudo-social-criticism of Arabian leaders than an actual comedy.

Maybe it feels like that, because the movie is all pro Jewish and VERY unfunny.
It's basically just shithouse humor with a lot of ""Arabs are ridiculous. We're victims and so much better.""

I, especially, dislike the Wii scene with the Munich massacre part. Feels like the death of innocent Jewish athletes is being milked for some crappy political message.

In the end it really felt like shitty comedy trying to cover up a lot of propaganda :/

Am kinda disappointed."
