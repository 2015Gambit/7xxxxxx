,nongnotno,2012-08-05T10:00Z,99.8% too. Is it fake ?
,RTT2,2012-08-05T12:33Z,"Why not play it and find out? It is actually a common problem, sometimes the torrent file does that, but even if true, I seriously doubt you'd notice the loss of 0.2%.  Even if the playback halts, you can fix it with 'meteorite' (google project meteorite) and it will play absolutely fine!"
,nongnotno,2012-08-05T17:33Z,"Thank you RTT2. 
I played it and it's fine like you told."
,RTT2,2012-08-05T17:48Z,No problem! Glad it's OK ;)
