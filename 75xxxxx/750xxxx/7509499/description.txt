With rare access to the notoriously private Amish community, this series follows five Amish teenagers traveling to Britain on an extraordinary cultural exchange.

The Amish live strictly sheltered lives based on their belief that living simply brings them closer to God. They have their own language and rules and are rarely educated past primary level. They often don't use electricity or cars, they don't wear zips or sleeveless clothes, nor do they drink or smoke.

Despite this strict lifestyle, Amish parents often allow their teenage children to experience the outside world, through a rite of passage called 'Rumspringa'.

During their stay in Britain, the Amish youngsters hope to share their values with their British counterparts as well as learning and understanding what British teenage life is all about.

The series highlights the ways and whims of British teenage tribes through the eyes of the Amish
