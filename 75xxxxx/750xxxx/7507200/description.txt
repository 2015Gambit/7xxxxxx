Information
------------------------------

Austin heads to Western Canada's Great Bear Rainforest in search of a full-grown grizzly. And he's not taking any chances; he's timed his mission to coincide with the annual salmon run, which lures bears of all sizes out into the open for feeding.

After flying in to one of British Columbia's remote coastal islands, Austin patrols the inland rivers in search of grizzlies. Austin battles torrential rivers, downpours and mountainous terrain in his search for these great bears and is finally rewarded; he finds a young male grizzly fishing the rivers. Austin gets some great photos but it's not the full grown adult he's after.

After days of searching and spotting bears either too young or distant to photograph, Austin finally spots a mother grizzly with cubs. He follows, cutting inland through dense forest. When he finally emerges, Austin finds himself in the most extraordinary valley. And face to face with full grown mother grizzly.

Also in this episode, Austin encounters a chirping Canadian Western toad, and walks through rivers teeming with spawning salmon.
