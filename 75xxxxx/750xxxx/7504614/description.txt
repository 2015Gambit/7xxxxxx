"A smart idea." - The Guardian

"Leagues ahead of the same ole, same ole single player mode of its major league counterparts." - Bullz-Eye

As an ongoing work in progress, Wrestling Revolution is the world's first "episodic" wrestling game - featuring regular storylines and match-ups that you would expect from a TV show. Except a game pans out differently each time you play!

This spectacular "Pay-Per-View" show features 12 brand new matches that were too cool for school. Witness some of your favourite stars square up in dream matches and share their thoughts on the revolution - culminating in a massive 10-man tag showdown and a 10-man Battle Royal. Players are also given their first chance to create their own wrestler - who could even win the chance to become a permanent part of the game.

As of v1.02, there is a whole other card - featuring 10 more matches where old scores are settled and new rivalries threaten to erupt!
