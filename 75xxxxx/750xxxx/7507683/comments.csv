[V],Scrufuss,2012-08-06T04:59Z,Green skull means good. (So does blue and that ugly pink one..) 99.8% of the time
,Jonasx,2012-08-06T05:03Z,It's the real thing; look for the VIP status uploaders when it comes to new releases and you'll be fine.
,craddle,2012-08-06T05:04Z,"Green Skull = Real

Whoever gave -1 on quality is an asshole."
,MalikeW,2012-08-06T05:04Z,"Its real, but 2 fucking GB? Seriously?  Wait for the same quality 300MB rips soon."
,Chip_Tune,2012-08-06T05:06Z,@skunk: Course it's real.  Green skull means it's legit.  DibyaTPB is the usr account for PublicHD here.
,Jerg12,2012-08-06T05:10Z,Why the hell would you download something that is 2.07 GB when it should only be about 400mb
,drummerpunk7,2012-08-06T05:13Z,why are all the early legit files so damn big? WTB 700mb uploads!

,ElSofoque,2012-08-06T05:18Z,Seems real but WAY to large a file for a 50 minute episode.
,coocooforcocopuffs,2012-08-06T05:22Z,Why is this episode so large!?
,c1565770,2012-08-06T05:24Z,"This will be real, DibyaTPB hasn't failed me so far this season."

,FTP-,2012-08-06T06:00Z,Wait for ettv or eztv for the 400mb files
,cmhenslin,2012-08-06T06:02Z,"It's a large file because it's High Res version.  You know, like it says right up there in the category."

,Budwa25,2012-08-06T06:08Z,strange my comment comes then goes away.. 
,.Leto.,2012-08-06T06:55Z,"lol @ the comments about file size. It's 2GB because it's 1280 x 720, 4 574 Kbps. Some of us have 22"" or 24"" monitors and want to watch their favorite tv series/movies with a good picture quality.
Thanks for the upload."
,Fitzy727,2012-08-06T07:11Z,Thanks dib :)
,AdjustedJunk,2012-08-06T07:36Z,"Anyone else having trouble DL'ing this file? I keep getting an error, something about the file is already  in use by another process...wtf?"
,SwimclubOphelia,2012-08-06T08:28Z,"There is a series called falling skies which is just about as long as true blood - yet the scene manages to pull off 720p with a much lower bitrate, clocking in @ less than 900mb per episode.

This bitrate here? It's ridiculously high."
,KD360,2012-08-06T10:16Z,"People complaining about the size, the higher size/bitrate means higher quality. If you seriously cannot see any difference between 2 gb 720p and a 700 mb 720p, then you have some serious problem with your eyes or your TV/PC screen.  You might as well download a 480p version instead of 700mb 720p, as the quality would probably be better on the 480p."
,FxIxSxH,2012-08-06T13:58Z,some have pc hooked to tv and want good picture quality thx Dibya
,dididie,2012-08-07T00:14Z,"How come public HD is the only uploaders where the seeders outmatch the leechers, and I only get 40 fucking kb/s?  Everyone else that I DL from gives me over 1mb/s  Wtf gives?  Stop bottle necking the uploads assholes.  Some of us would like to see this before the next fucking episode airs."
,cfkpower,2012-08-07T13:43Z,thanks!!
