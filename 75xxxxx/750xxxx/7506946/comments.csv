,analien8mycat,2012-08-06T17:55Z,"However ideologically speaking: a hundred years from now, long after having returned to the great insentient Nothing, do you really believe any of the survivors of Lovelock's stochastically reasoned 90 plus percent population die-off by late century will give a rat's ass about this thesis or its antithesis? So where is the currency in any such adolescent ad hominem blog?"

WhatÂ´ll come next, a creationist  mathematician who statistically claims to able the prove the existence of their precious ""designer""?

Answer this instead: If you claim to have case for this ""designer"", then who designed that designer?

I the beginning man created God, because the imagination of man did not reach any further."
