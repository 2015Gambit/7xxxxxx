I have 3 cuts by Rihanna solo from that same day V Fest. If it would make any difference, you guys know just what do... Ladies, I can't hear you.

(I will be posting them likely later tonight on DIME. This is a HQ MKV @ the original resolution, not the upscale HD TS you can find elsewhere online.


Just Gonna Stand There And Watch Me Burn Dept: E was the V Fest headliner, and without introduction Rihanna just joined him in the flesh on stage. 'Love The Way You Lie' -- oh, you may have heard of that, love -- it only topped 26 music charts around the world 2 summers ago, sat at No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 7 consecutive weeks, and was the biggest-selling single in the UK that year.

The Love The You Lie V Fest vid was made by Eminem's people, for his fans. The video was posted late last August at his website, Facebook and Twitter. You can only get to it on youtube through a provided link. On yt, it is a private, unlisted file. 

The track was professionally recorded with multiple cameras, and then edited later. It has not been officially released.

The visuals plus the performance is amazeballs of fire.
