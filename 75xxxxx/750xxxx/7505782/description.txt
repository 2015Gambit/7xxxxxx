2. Download desired Modern Warfare 2 save game file to your desktop. 

3. Uzip it using WinZip or any similar tool, and you'll get a SVG (savegame) file.

4. Seek for installation folder on your hard drive (usually C:/Program Files/Activision/Modern Warfare 2/) and copy SVG file to players/save/.

5. Open players/settings_s.zip.iw4 file using previously installed Notepad++. Find this piece of text:
