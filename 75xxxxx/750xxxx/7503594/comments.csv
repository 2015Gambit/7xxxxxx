,aerosoldier,2012-08-04T19:12Z,Anyone knows where can i find english subtitles?
,sofiayy,2012-08-04T21:00Z,"Downloaded the torrent, it's loading so slow! But thanks anyway for the upload! I really hope there isn't any repeated scenes like it was on the other torrents. "
,bmdj1992,2012-08-04T21:12Z,Thanks for the rerip. Although I don't know how hard it is to upload a decent version that isn't in 2 parts... But beggars can't be choosers.
,hellosea,2012-08-04T21:26Z,Is it in two parts?

,aerosoldier,2012-08-04T23:04Z,@tverlaine: thanks for the subtitles and thatnks @Test_Verify for this awesome torrent :D
,martian86,2012-08-05T03:59Z,Is it possible to merge the 2 cds together? I would rather have one file than 2.
,FieroGT,2012-08-05T04:13Z,"i cant find a single 1.3 gig version that isnt in 2 dam parts... why would anyone do that anymore. no one uses cds anymore.. i'm sorry to complain, but dam... this is silly"
,dblindowl,2012-08-05T05:22Z,"@bmdj man youre right, beggars can't be choosers lol"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-05T06:26Z,"Thanks a lot!

It takes less than a minute to merge two parts in avidemux and other similar programs. Get over it."
,dilly58,2012-08-05T17:30Z,"@FriendlySpidey

CDs and 700MB files are a thing of the past. Get over it. Move on to the next decade and leave 1998 Hollywood behind.

,steinbrenner,2012-08-06T00:16Z,Real deal
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-07T21:28Z,"dilly58 = lazy ingrate. Thanks again Test_Verify. Just watched it and quality was great. I appreciate the re-rip even if other lazier, more entitled ingrates don't."
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-07T21:30Z,"@Dilly58. If you were with us here in 2012, you'd realize how simple it is to merge two 700 mb files with very very little effort. What a baby."
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-07T21:32Z,"You do realize that 2012 is not the next decade after 1998, right? "
