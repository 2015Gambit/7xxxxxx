Thx 4 the upload crackhead. ;)"
,tj1ng15,2012-08-05T15:40Z,"Video: 7,5
Audio: 5

The throwing punches sounds like something I've never heard before, a crazy ass noise. :(

I'll wait for the DVDRip but thanks for the UL anyway. :)"
,js1684,2012-08-05T23:58Z,"The audio is out of sync in this one. Early in the beginning, perfect in the middle and late in the end. It's like the audio is longer than the video by a few seconds, screwing the whole thing up. 

Add on the fact that every noise louder than talking was over loading the mic, so it sounds like a broken subwoofer. Oh, and the kid talking the entire time.

I get it. It's free. Just listing the issues to save anyone time if these could bother them.

,radix10,2012-08-06T01:12Z,There is a little kid talking the entire time. If I was at the theater...I would of spent six dollars on the biggest soda they had and then walked back in and poured in on the little bastard's head...

,pokefreaken,2012-08-08T12:20Z,People who talk in the theater should have their legs cut off and have them sewn in the middle of their chest.
