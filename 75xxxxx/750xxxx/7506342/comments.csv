,module409,2012-08-09T09:22Z,"Days ago, I got this Majestic file via RARBG. No one else had it, unless a smaller size file. Anyway, it pixilates during the darker scenes. It's a good file size with a good bit rate. Can't explain it. :(  I'm going for the LTT file as LTT 1080p is always great, especially when it's a big file size. "
