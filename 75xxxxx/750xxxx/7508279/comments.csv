,luapttam85,2012-08-13T03:45Z,"Question: Any idea why this and the show The Event would show up as unsupported data when either trying to transfer or stream to a PS3? 

Picture quality is perfect and audio is great. It just won't show up on my PS3. 

Not a big deal (I just hooked up my laptop to my tv and am watching that way). I'm just curious as to why it might do that. No other rip from 20-40 I have had has done this. 

Thanks for all you do! "
