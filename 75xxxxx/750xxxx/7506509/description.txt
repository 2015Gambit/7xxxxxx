DNA profilingΓÇöcommonly known as DNA fingerprintingΓÇöis often heralded as unassailable criminal evidence, a veritable ΓÇ£truth machineΓÇ¥ that can overturn convictions based on eyewitness testimony, confessions, and other forms of forensic evidence. But DNA evidence is far from infallible. Truth Machine traces the controversial history of DNA fingerprinting by looking at court cases in the United States and United Kingdom beginning in the mid-1980s, when the practice was invented, and continuing until the present. Ultimately, Truth Machine presents compelling evidence of the obstacles and opportunities at the intersection of science, technology, sociology, and law.
