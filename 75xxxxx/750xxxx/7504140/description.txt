This book aims to bring together the science behind and the management
of ballistic trauma. It is directed at the surgeon, though perhaps not an
expert, who might find him or herself having to deal with patients suffering
from penetrating trauma in environments as diffuse as a late twentiethcentury
hospital or the arduous conditions of a battlefield.
The book also brings together the views of UK and US experts from
military and civilian backgrounds.This composite view was deliberate, as it
was recognized that these potentially diverse views reflected the complexity
of an international problem that increasingly impinges on the practice
of surgery in todayΓÇÖs world.
