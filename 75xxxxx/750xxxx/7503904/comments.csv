In reference to the narrative about smoking and lung cancer. The tobacco companies were right. There is no link to cancer. There is a host of respiratory disorders caused by smoking. But the cancer is caused by radioactive polonium in mineral-derived fertilizers. It survives uptake into the lungs and emits alpha particles forever. The use of this cheap fertilizer is not controlled by state agricultural departments because tobacco is not eaten. 

So the nay-sayers are not always liars. Sometimes, they just know the difference between evidence and religion."
