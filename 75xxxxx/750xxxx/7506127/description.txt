our Sim gains newfound independence and responsibilities as a business owner. In addition to learning how to build a company from the ground up, your Sim puts in the time to keep the business running, managing other Sims, and doing all they can to make their customers happy! With success comes the perks of a great reputation in Bluewater Village, not mention a steady revenue stream. So if you want your Sim to make an impression with their employees and customers or reward them after a hard day's work, have your Sim do it in style with great fashions and swanky kitchen and bath amenities!
