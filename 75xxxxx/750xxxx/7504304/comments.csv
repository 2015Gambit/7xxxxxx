,ascorbic,2012-08-04T23:27Z,"He lists HDChina as the source, which I believe works as intended.  The BLOW source has the repeated scenes."
,dginger,2012-08-04T23:28Z,"everyone's just re-upping the shitty version, I don't understand why."
,Alaerys,2012-08-05T00:53Z,"Just got it in and checked where one of the blips was recorded in another version, and didn't see it.

Clean version"
,puppyluv,2012-08-05T03:09Z,"so, are you saying this one DOESN'T have the repeated scenes? "
,dginger,2012-08-05T05:07Z,this is confirmed as being the fixed REAL version! Great download!

The Vid is an OK rip for the size, not bad, not outstanding, but the low end sound is horrible in parts, just a rumble. I didn't see any repeated parts. "

That's what I typed, dipshit. Maybe YOU should have your brain checked if you can't read and comprehend a simple sentence. 

Anyway, maybe you need a better TV if you think the vid quality of this upload is better than 5/10. Quit watching your movies on that $15 Walmart MP4 player and you might know what good quality video looks like."
