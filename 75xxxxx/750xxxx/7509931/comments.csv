You don't need to download all the content.dmg's. The additional content can be downloaded easily from inside Logic."

Everybody on that one is having problems with getting the content ... The serial I used for that is E-342-PXV-169-TMH-378-IKJ-435-KXZ-FFS-41PX ... Then I just installed all the content from this torrent ... I got everything, Instruments, Jam Packs, Processors, all of it working 100% ... Hope this helps ... ROCK ON ..."
