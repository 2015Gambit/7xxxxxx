All the Mad Conductor I could find as of Aug 2012

Cultivated in Nazareth PA transplanted to the Bayou
From the deepest darkest creases of the Space/Time
Between the country of Hip the republic of Hop and the finally sovereign nation of SPACE ROCK
on the corner of punk and instant cult classic
Sits a shack that with the combined powers of an almighty shaman McKinney produced a song that Will or already HAS built the mansion of a better world
This band is the plant super food th@ will bring life back to the rainforest of music
the rudest of rude boys
