Within a matter of a few weeks after release of the band's first album, Livin' The Blues', the album jumped to position 10 on the Roots Report Top 50 Blues Weekly Chart. This chart is a composite of the number of ""spins"" or radio play throughout the United States.

Early career of Shaun Murphy

Shaun Murphy, living in her then home town of Detroit, Michigan, in the early seventies, was noticed by personnel from Motown Records in a local theater production. (Murphy previously had a few years of experience singing in local Detroit bands, after high school where she gained singing experience in choir). She recorded an album with Meat Loaf, under a subsidiary of Motown, Rare Earth Records. The duo, Stoney & Meatloaf, recorded only one album under the label. The group was short lived. Murphy was retained under contract by Motown after the album release. She then went on over the years to tour and do studio work with Eric Clapton, Joe Walsh, Bob Seger, The Moody Blues, Bruce Hornsby, Glenn Frey, Phil Collins, John Hiatt, Leon Russell, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Sheena Easton, Little Feat, and many others."
