is meant to be the greater than symbol."
,BasilBrush,2012-08-05T12:08Z,"Another mistake.

Where is says ""Women's Team Sprint"" above it should read ""Women's Team Pursuit"".

Unfortunately the description field is not editable."

Check the index numbers before downloading - they change every day as files are added and removed from the list.
The files are only available for about 7 days. Day 1 events are no longer available."
,BasilBrush,2012-08-05T15:19Z,"It's normal for get_iplayer downloads to fail. If this happens delete the partially downloaded FLV file and try again but add --force to the end of the command line.

For example:
get_iplayer --get XXX --modes flashvhigh --force
where XXX is the 3 digit index number."
