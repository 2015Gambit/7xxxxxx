,ashu_9,2012-08-05T16:20Z,THE GAME IS NOT WORKING!!!!!!!!!!
[V],globeplus,2012-08-05T18:00Z,"To ashu_9 : i hope you already downloaded this game file and tested because i did that and as i know everything is ok .

Sorry for uploading 1 week later than the original file but only now i get the opportunity to take a look and make the best possible ripping work , i have a few years now making this type of files and maybe i am not Mr.Perfect all the time specially because some games have tough files to work with and many times archives without any working tools , this type of work it is not always easy but when i decide to make the work at some game i give the best possible shot under the circunstances for this type of file no doubt ...

Criticising without  fundamented proves it is not right ... see all of you and happy game ..."
,sagar.19,2012-08-05T19:10Z,hey thks for the upload ..ur rip has the smallest size among all others...but just a bit late coz already downloaded the black box version..but still thks..
[V],globeplus,2012-08-05T19:48Z,"To sagar.19 : thank you for your comment and i complete agree with you but when we do nice work on the files just for the file sharing spirit , still positive right ? At least i feel like i didn´t loosed the touch for a possible work on this type of files when i get the opportunity and that it is good too ...

thank you and happy game to all of you ."
,GObonzo,2012-08-05T21:39Z,why do people want games changed to low quality audio/video and with removed content?
[V],globeplus,2012-08-05T22:08Z,"To Gobonzo : thank you for your comment in the way that the maded question can ask to ourselfs , why generally nice games rips are downloaded by many users ?... the answer is : less hard disk space and that can be noticed even more after 10 or 20 games on the hard drive , if the rips are well worked that can mean less 30 or 40 gb for the same installed 10 or 15 games , more easy transportation for flash drives because they have less space and finally can be more easy recorded in very common 4.7 Gb blank discs , saving less discs recorded for the same number of games and the quick note for the users with not too much internet downloading speed that with less game files sizes can make an effort to get a wished game specially too if they have services with downloading limitation (1 , 2 or 4 GB) for example , to the normal downloaders with positive downloading speed the advantages are the ones already mentionated , so my friendly user as you can see are many advantages on this type of work but of course if the work is correct on the rips and that it is not always easy depending on the game type of archives and helping tools to work with but with luck some of the new games can still be possible nice possible work ... thank you for reading and happy game to all of you ."
,jkg55,2012-08-06T10:15Z,heey dude is ur rip have every thing means u dont cut even a single bite & only downgraded the quality or have u removed anything if Yes Can u Plz Mention with making a read nfo file or ur rip 
,reno1325,2012-08-06T11:48Z,Thx Globe ! best ripped ever
[V],globeplus,2012-08-06T12:53Z,"To jkg55 : you have to excuse me but i think it wasn´t possible to be more precise about the work on the file specially if you read the first comment of this file .

To 1325 : thank you for your comment and the intention it is always that but sometimes the carachteristics of the files of the games don´t let too much a positive work for this kind of file because for example heavy type of archives almost without compression and no modding tools to help or something , when it is possible the idea it is really do the best possible work for this kind of file ... thank you and happy games to you ."
,sudeep_58,2012-08-06T12:56Z,"@ globe: the essential video are downgraded? Thanks in Advance, ur rip are always good and small size with quality. Keep up the good work"
[V],globeplus,2012-08-06T14:42Z,"To sudeep58 : the answer is no , all the essencial necessary videos are keeped like that but because the archive type can´t be worked , what i mean is that sometimes it is possible the downgrade in safery and keeping quality and believe that it is true , in this particular game file that it is not the case and the essencial videos better be untouched ... happy games to you ."
[V],globeplus,2012-08-06T14:44Z,"CORRECTION : i mean it safety and not safery on the before comment , it was the rush on the typing of the word , my excuses for that and happy game to all of you ."
,jkg55,2012-08-06T15:38Z,& How about a readnfo file
[V],globeplus,2012-08-06T19:30Z,"Ro jkg55 : you have to understand that if i include a file like that the idea is that it is crap the conteud of the file besides that work anyway , an nfo file it is nothing more than demogagy or just publicity for fun , in this case what it is matter it is the game works and i am here to help if anything it wrong somehow with my possibilitys and that don´t make sense to include in an nfo ... the description of the files is to be read and somehow you are implicating that i am hiding something about the file , what you need to know is on the description and on the first comment , this type of work sometimes is tough to explain , it is lke i need a full relatory to explain everything done ... so just trust the uploader work if you want ... thank you for reding and don´t be so apreensive about the file , it is 3.39 gb only anyway , no matter what you can´t loose ... see you and happy game to you ."
