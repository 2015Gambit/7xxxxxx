,hax99,2012-09-01T15:40Z,"Slurrrrp, i didn't just spend 6 1/2 hrs raring these files together for nothing. If you Havant noticed, all torrents that arnt rared and give you the ability to get cretin games, have failed. Lets say you only want  PSP - ATV Off Road Fury and PSP - Dave Mirra bmx, well ok but that means you are only seeding those 2 games, now i have to host servers and also seed other torrents, so i cant be seeding this torrent all the time,  so some games would not be seeded."
