Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the latest news, including Lubbock County Judge Tom Head's warning that if Obama gets re-elected there will be a civil war in America. 

He also covers the BBC censoring a video of Syrian rebels forcing a prisoner to become a suicide bomber, Obama's Labor Department spending $500,000 in stimulus money on a "green job" ad to be broadcast on friendly liberal television shows, and the TSA rifling through bags at a Paul Ryan event. 

Alex also talks with Jamie Balagia, a trial attorney known as the "DWI Dude." Balagia is a former Austin police officer known for going head-to-head in court over spurious charges brought by predatory cops and prosecutors. He is lauded for his work in social activism, civil rights, and police accountability. 

Alex also talks with the journalist and blogger Syrian Girl on today's broadcast.
