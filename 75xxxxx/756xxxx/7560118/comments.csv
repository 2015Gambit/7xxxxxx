Mike Rowe journeys dangerous roads to Australiaâs northern coast to work with Aboriginals, who have lived off the land for more than 40,000 years. Itâs a dirty adventure that leaves Mike speechless as he works and hunts (yes, hunts) with tribal leaders."

Your right about the TPB members not being as thankful.
If the fookers come after uploaders from Demoniod like you say, you were one of the biggest uploaders(thanks). Are you scared? Ha! ha!! 

PS- I can't find Auction Kings ANYWHERE. You have any luck?"
[V],psspss,2012-08-24T16:49Z,"not scared.. as they wasting their time going after someone not living in usa..

which goes to show the content is everywhere already on the web

and p2p is always the last place it shared on

so they wasting their efforts going after anyone on demon

big uploaders in usa are a bit more clever how they get others to upload it for them :)"

,zaroba,2012-09-08T01:42Z,"nevermind.  with how screwed up the seasons are, even on discovery with all the breaks the show takes, I'm pretty sure it's nearly impossible to tell the exact seasons anymore"
