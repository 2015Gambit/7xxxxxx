This is one of the best torrent I agree
but you cannot compare it with this one

The.Avengers.2012.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-EbP [PublicHD]

This is encode TESA 64 With subme=11 and b-frames=8 & this one is much better than yours
I`m not sure either it is a size or the settings
but you already said once its not the bitrate which makes quality best but the settings
No offence"
[T],HighCode,2012-08-24T12:26Z,"Don't just claim it is better, but prove it too.
 If you didn't download my copy there is no way you can compare them. 
That torrent is 14 GB LOL, and you're saying it's the best compression (obviously you don't know the meaning of compression).
Also subme=11 (is in the gui but) is not working (not improving quality at all) yet with the current x264-s. Do some reading before showing off how smart you are.
Post here 4 snaps (snapped from that huge torrent) of the same frames I posted in description. Then we can do comparison. Till then S.T.F.U."
,Night_89,2012-08-24T13:41Z,"I downloaded yours first
but then EbP encoded it & I downloaded that(EbP always encodes with TESA) then I compared it
EbP has much details in it than yours
(waiting for FASM release, would delete EbP release as well then)"
[T],HighCode,2012-08-24T16:18Z,"Night_89, 
you're full of shit. As I said show as the snap shots from the same frames, otherwise nobody believes a word what you say.
If you downloaded my copy you wouldn't have said in comment that his encode has frames=8, because mine has 8 as well lol. I wonder how big is your screen talking about the details. There is a rule; Don't comment if you didn't (or don't intend to) download. If you do you're just a cheap troll & flamer. yuk.

 ""Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know"" (how true)

If you like to make sense do yourself some samples under different settings then you'll learn something. Theory is one thing, practice is an other.

All my encodes I do with the same settings so please in the future stay away from my torrents. Farewell and enjoy arse-licking to your beloved EbP.

And to all those who completed in less then an hour then stopped seeding-
 shame on you all for not leaving at least a short ""thx"" or something. FYI I uploaded over 100 ratio this torrent and many leechers downloaded with 3 MB/s."
,Night_89,2012-08-24T17:22Z,"I already said in the first comment ""No offence""
because I knew you would take it personally
and you know what?
when I compared your rip with EbP, it looked like I am comparing a dvdrip with bdrip.
Don`t shout, just kidding
I know you are one of the good (of course not best) encoder tpb has, & I`ve downloaded many of your torrents, but what I felt after watching both of those encodes, I just wrote it with ""No Offence"""
[T],HighCode,2012-08-24T17:45Z,"You say I shouldn't take it personaly,
then why on hell did you bitch only on my torrent? Go ahead and comment also on the others because they are crap too compare to EbP release because ""your beloved hero"" encoded it with tesa.
Besides you asked me here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7555502/Stand_by_Me_1986_BDRip_1080p_multi_HighCode-PHD  to upload The Avengers, and replied as well. Now, instead of getting a ""thx"" all I get  is flaming. 

Sorry my honorable  friend, don't take it personally ( I know you are one of the good if not best cocksuckers) but you are one of the most annoying motherfucker-critic-jerk in history of torrents-world.
By the way you still got a few thousands of torrents to criticize because they were not encoded with tesa. Good job with it!
 As I said before tesa gains nothing in quality, just a waste of time and electricity bill lol."
,Night_89,2012-08-24T18:27Z,"OK. Now this is getting really serious
I didn`t criticize on other torrents because they didn`t say anything about TESA or the quality, they just uploaded it and they are not their personnel encodes (CHD, WIKI, Refined, RX, EbP)
this is your personnel encode. I, before, requested you to upload It with TESA, ""YOU"" said that is nothing good about TESA. I agreed because I didn`t have anything to compare but when EbP uploaded it, I just got a comparision.
I didn`t say anything mean to you and didn`t criticize and not saying now
just a personnel opinion what I felt about b/w the encodes
Now, you decide who is the >>>>>>>>>>>"
,Night_89,2012-08-24T18:30Z,"and of course 
thanks for this one
hahahahahaha,,,,,"
[T],HighCode,2012-08-24T19:49Z,"Night_89  hahaha laughing like a silly donkey.
Take your finger off my torrents from now on. 
If you still dare download them will harm your self-esteem and will bring you unluck because I put a spell on them. "
,Night_89,2012-08-24T21:17Z,"spell on the torrents
yeah okay 
now I have 4 ears and 2 noses
master in both torrents and spells
appreciated"
