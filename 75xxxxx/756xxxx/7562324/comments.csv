[V],TheExecutive,2012-08-24T08:28Z,"Larry Storch, Forrest Tucker's former co-star from both ""F-Troop"" and the ""The Ghost Busters"" Saturday morning TV series was in this ??  I didn't even notice him -- it must have been an unbilled cameo.

Also in the guest cast is Danny Wells, who was then being seen as Charlie, the bartender on ""The Jeffersons""."
