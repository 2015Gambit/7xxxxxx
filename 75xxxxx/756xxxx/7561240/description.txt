The Tonight Show - Carsons Animal Hijinks [2002] VHS Rip

Some of the Tonight Show's most unforgettable moments occurred when Joan Embery of the San Diego Zoo and Jim Fowler of Wild Kingdom introduced audiences and Johnny to the always unpredictable world of wild and exotic animals. Time and again, these loveable critters reminded us all that the King of Late Night was no match for the animal kingdom.
