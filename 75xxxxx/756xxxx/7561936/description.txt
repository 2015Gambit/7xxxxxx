Description:

David Wilkerson Sermons:
The Reverend David Wilkerson is an American Christian evangelist. He is also the founding Pastor of Times Square Church in New York City, an interdenominational church, and President of World Challenge, Inc.  Wilkerson's sermons are known for being direct and frank. He emphasizes Christian beliefs, such as: God's holiness and righteousness, God's love towards humans and especially Christian views of Jesus. Wilkerson tries to avoid categorizing Christians into distinct groups according to the parish they belong to, and as such he is considered by many to be a truly ecumenical evangelist.

God had a plan that you and I would not only survive but that we would be more than over comers. It doesnΓÇÖt matter how wicked the world becomes and what the devil brings on society ΓÇô we have abiding in us a power that is greater than any other power. This power is the Holy Spirit!! You have not fully received the Holy Spirit until you allow Him to do what He was sent to do. We are to cast every burden on Him ΓÇôHE is the Burden Bearer. As we turn every burden over to Him ΓÇô We are receiving Him.  David Wilkerson's powerful preaching against the Great Apostasy taking root in the Church in these last days
