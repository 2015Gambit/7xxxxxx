[T],jmz619,2012-08-25T23:21Z,does this increase upload speed aswell? and does it matter what version of utorrent you're using? i often switch between 3.x and 2.2.1
,vedroo43,2012-08-25T23:42Z,perfecktly
,Slay_,2012-08-26T00:03Z,"Changed the language of uTorrent into Dutch (I think it was Dutch), but you can figure out how to change it back to English fairly easily. Thanks."
,digimike50,2012-08-26T00:24Z,Looks interesting - thanks!
,Tunia,2012-08-26T11:12Z,ThumperTM do something and help people use torrent in tunnel proxy !!!! I have tried almost all available tweaks but it just doesn work!
,Thatsgold,2012-08-26T12:42Z,Will post back to see if it actually made any difference
,shaggy.ray,2012-08-26T13:23Z,seriously?
,Amaze904,2012-08-26T21:46Z,Is this compatible with Bittorrent?
[V],ThumperTM,2012-08-26T21:51Z,"^ Nope, this is for uTorrent only!"
,soletar,2012-08-27T05:40Z,"At the risk of sounding dumb...

i suspect this patch is just a way of ""forcing"" leechers who run after downloading a file to seed... i really don't see how this will help your speed if you have crappy bandwidth...i guess it just optimises what you have


Anyway, i have just downloaded it and i am using it, Thanks Mr Thumper!"
,piranical,2012-08-27T12:13Z,"downloaded it, ran it as admin, patched it and my speeds actually appeared slower. my utorrent is most of the time and i've seeded more than 3 times what i've dlded so leeching's not the problem so is there something i missed?"
,noel_lee,2012-08-27T17:30Z,it doesnt change a thing.
,soletar,2012-08-28T05:54Z,Kudos to both the uploader and patch developer..but i didnt see ANY noticeable increase. THANKS
,uheardmebitch,2012-08-30T01:48Z,people who believe something like this will work have absolutely no idea how computers work. and no brain. if this was possible wouldn't uttorent just build it into the program???????
,pirateshoman,2012-09-01T17:48Z,"The only thing this app does is that it changes some settings of the UTP protocol, in the time of analog modems there were a lot of apps that claimed to speed up modems but they were all bullshit. if speeding the ÂľTorrent was possible they would've done it already and would've not waited for some half ass 15 year old self appointed programmer to do that for them."
,muthu94,2012-09-03T16:11Z,is this work????
