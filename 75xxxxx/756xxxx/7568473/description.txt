Great, multi-functional and multi-format reader for devices running OS Android. The program has a lot of settings so that everyone can adjust it to your preference. Built a very comfortable and interesting function "bookshelf." The other programs of this type is different and more beautiful interface, realistic page turning effect, built-PRO-the skins, which, incidentally, is very effective longer battery life (duration testing at SGS Plus).
