The realm of Bizarre news (on aug 18 last SAT)
COVERS UFOS ETS WEIRD CRIME CRYPTO

Pilot episode as reported in this openminds.tv

I can find on web as yet.. i dont think it was capped and leaked"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T09:44Z,"I cant post a link to the info.. stupid TPB wont allow it LOL

but heres some blurb about the show---


Is the universe literally teeming with life? Are some UFO abductees being implanted with control chips? Is it possible that Bigfoot could be an alien entity? Are precognitive dreams a reality? Could paranormal forces be pushing cars up enigmatic gravity hills? Was the mighty T.Rex covered with feathers? What is causing an Aussie lake to glow brilliant blue? Who has been stealing female cadavers from Russian cemeteries?

These are among the intriguing subjects that I plan to probe on my new TV program,Professor Weird, which will be debuting on the Science Channel on Saturday, August 18 at 9 p.m. with repeats at midnight and Monday at 4 a.m."

,SerSpec-V,2012-08-27T20:57Z,^Ya some videos are good like The Soyuz Conspiracy and others are old and boring. I will check out the Skeptic link. 
[V],psspss,2012-08-28T03:04Z,"yeh thats one one about the russia astro that died in a failed mission and russia covered it up wasnt it.?. think its been in a few docus over the years
although the name slips mind but have share them

I wasnt bothered about adding it since it wasnt on UFOS I recall?

I may add it in the next bundle though
ufotv add some stuff from nasa and other things not just ufos.. or ancient aliens stuff

of course you could grab it and convert to xvid and share as well.. pays to learn these things of grabbing streams and making xvids :)"
