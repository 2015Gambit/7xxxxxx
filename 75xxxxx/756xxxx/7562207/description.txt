1. Amplified them just a bit.
2. Cut out all commercials (thanks to Captain77S for cutting half of them)
3. Added ID3 tags so they'll show up in an iPod (Hate looking under "Unknown Artist")
4. Reduced the damn file names! (The original file names are needlessly too long so I can't see which hour I'm listening to)
5. Removed superflous files ("Muslim in the White House" link, news, etc)

Thanks to Captain77S for the original files!

I'll make sure they stay seeded this time.
