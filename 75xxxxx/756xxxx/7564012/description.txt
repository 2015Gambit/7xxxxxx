The most popular note taking application in Amazon app store is now available at Google Play.
After enduring tons of clumsy note applications, which were not very intuitive nor easy to use, we have created Handy Note to fulfill our needs. 

We developed our product to make it powerful and easy to use. Our aim is to bring a handy tool to the market that will replace paper notebooks and keep the same user experience.
The characteristics of Handy Note can be summarized in three words ΓÇ£Freedom, Professionalism and ConvenienceΓÇ¥
