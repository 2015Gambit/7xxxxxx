Release Notes....: The NFL Network strikes again. As usual they have that stupid fucking
                   ticker at the bottom which I cropped out. If you didn't already figure 
                   it out, that's why it looks like a retard cropped these games. Also, 
                   as a special treat, NFL Network goes to commercial mid-sentence when 
                   the commentators are still speaking. If some of the cuts seem 
                   unnatural, that is why. Enjoy the game!
