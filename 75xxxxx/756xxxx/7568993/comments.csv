,Tanlic,2012-08-26T11:20Z,"Is this some kind of vendetta, did we wrong you in another life?

I'm damned if I can get this to work.

I suspected it might still contain a trojan so I tuned off Nod 32 but it still doesn't work.

I would have thought the fact it has a trojan in it 
you would take a few seconds to warn newcomers and tell them how to avoid their Virus protection deleting the files it would seem the trojan has been moved to the Bhudda.dll ile this time.

Can I ask did you try this at home before uploading it? I you did then perhaps full instructions of how you did it will help because I would love to know WTF I am doing wrong........apart from downloading this piece of shit that is"

Set compatibility to Windows 95, add Buddha.dll to AV exclusions."
