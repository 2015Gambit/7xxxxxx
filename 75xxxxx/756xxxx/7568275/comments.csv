,kimgofJOY62,2012-08-25T20:07Z,"if it doesnt work remember to 
1. Delete everything inside C:ProgramDataVideoCopilot
2. After installing, replace '.AEX' with the cracked one [32 or 64] bit of dpends on After Effects. NOT WINDOWS.
3. Run After Effects and add Element3D to a solid layer.
4. Inthe authorisation form, generate a request and do NOT CLOSE IT.
5. Generate a License with Spiders License generator.
6. Install the License from inside AE through the Authorisation form.
7.thats it ENJOY

,Excalibur1975,2012-08-25T21:09Z,"It doesn't work for me. I followed the instructions but same message than kostandinangjellari. I am running AE CS6 (x64) on windows 7 (64bits)
I deleted the VideoCopilot folder into Programdata before installing Element 3d installer 1.0.345, then replacing Element.aex (x64), launching AE etc.. Element 3D until the License screen appears, creating a request file, using the LicGen.exe and installing the ElementLicense file before I get the error message.... I don't know what I did wrong... "
,xxsanchezxx,2012-08-25T22:06Z,"Same problem...""The selected license file to appears to be invalid"""
,shotgecko,2012-08-25T23:41Z,Can't seem to get it to work. I keep getting 'invalid license' error and I'm following the instructions exactly. 
,skoxpress,2012-08-26T02:41Z,"YOU DA MAN !!

Thank you.

,skoxpress,2012-08-26T03:45Z,"Excalibur1975

 I've got the same set up as you do. The only thing I did differently was using the E3D I had installed already. Same version. Corrupt file, maybe?"
,benjiamj,2012-08-26T16:05Z,"Same i get invalid file 2, not sure what im doing wrong"
,shmir,2012-08-26T17:22Z,Great Job! But can this also register the extra packs?
,Excalibur1975,2012-08-26T17:36Z,"@Skoxpress and others who get the invalid license message... Spider is working on a new License generator.
The problem doesn't come from the OS or AE version used.
Sometimes, deleting the files inside the C:/ Programdata/ VideoCopilot folder (hidden) or updating your video card driver before to install the files may help.

For the others who still have the invalid license message, please wait. A new fix should be online soon."
,xtrajuice,2012-08-26T17:50Z,"This does not work.Invalid license.tried on CS4,CS5,CS6. Followed all steps still it says invalid .Plz help dying to use this plug in."
,huntas56,2012-08-26T18:30Z,"This does work. It worked for me before, but I was using version 1.0.322. That one has some annoying glitches, so I downloaded the updated one which is 1.0.345. If you try and use the crack on the updated one, it won't work."
,shmir,2012-08-26T20:04Z,"It does work great in Win7 64 bit AE CS6! I cant make it register the extra packs, only the plug in itself. Any solutions for that?
P.S Just follow the instructions carefully and it will work!"
,skoxpress,2012-08-26T20:13Z,"Excalibur1975

I guess I wasn't clear. Mine works fine, no problem.

Just thought already having the program installed already made a difference."
,wyldebro88,2012-08-27T01:27Z,"ok i must be a idiot. lol i have deleted program data numerous times, installed numberous, times . i can get to the scene setup but as soon as i load a model . it says unrecoverable error. im not sure but have followed both instructions . is there someone who is having or have had the same issue . any help will be awesome "

,xtrajuice,2012-08-27T07:29Z,"This is not working People,tried all things possible but it still says invalid license."
