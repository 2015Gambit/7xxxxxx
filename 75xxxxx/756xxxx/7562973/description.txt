 
Synopsis of The Gene Generation

In a future dystopia where thorough DNA scans are required to gain entrance into every major city, a world-class assassin (Bai Ling) is assigned the task of eliminating rogue DNA hackers. The sun has scorched the earth, and now dense clouds hang above overpopulated megacities. Those whose DNA is considered unworthy are locked out of the cities and forced to wander the wastelands. It's Michelle's duty to ensure that no undesirables gain entry into the city, and she earns a substantial paycheck for doing so. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
