You're most welcome, dick. And thanks!

I imagine some of this stuff must be hidden away inside larger collections/seeds, but people are clearly interested because they're grabbing them as fast as I can post 'em. I'm happy to share. I've had some of this stuff for years and I didn't get it from TPB to begin with. Happy to pass it on.

Anything else from Lapham you're looking for that you don't see already on TPB?"
