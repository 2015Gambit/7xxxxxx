,shmir,2012-08-26T17:23Z,Great Job! But can this also register the extra packs? I couldnt make it register anything but the plug in itself.

,xtrajuice,2012-08-26T17:49Z,"This does not work.Invalid license.tried on CS4,CS5,CS6. Followed all steps still it says invalid .Plz help dying to use this plug in."
,kostandinangjellari,2012-08-26T18:54Z,"xtrajuice it is tested and works perfectlly..
What you have to do before install it..
Unistall any other Element 3D Plugin Completely.
Be sure to delete program data in Program Data folder in Windows Seven or you find somewhere in User App Data in Windows XP.
After You are sure you have deleted anything related to what you had installed before install it and follow the instructions and you'll get the full version of Plugin you're dying for."
,kostandinangjellari,2012-08-26T18:56Z,"hey shmir download them Manually.

Extract them and import them.. or insert Into my documents/VideoCopilot then they will appear inside the plugin..."
,shmir,2012-08-26T20:52Z,"kostandinangjellari

Thank you. I will try this and report back if it worked. If you get a KG that also registers the extra packs with the same excellent results as this one, you will be a hero for many! Thanx!"

,Alex_nny,2012-08-27T07:11Z,"Ok, Here's what i did:
1.Install Element 3D 1.0.345
2. Replace the x64 file in AE plug-ins video copilot folder (I have Win 7 Ultimate 64 and i installed the CS6 master 64)
3.Open AE and create a composition, add a image and then click in ""Effects & Presets/Video Copilot/Element 3D"" and the license window opened.
4.Click request code on my desktop
5.I paste the license generator on my desktop and run it, it creates a second license file (the first being the request)
6.I click in AE on load license file and choose the one the license generator created
And it still it tell me its an invalid file, I tried uninstalling the plug-in completely and reinstall it, the same think happened, then on the E3 installation i click on custom and selected the ""X64"" but I had the same error, help :("
