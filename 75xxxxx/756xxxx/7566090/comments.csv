,kakosenazvati,2012-08-25T12:21Z,"ok, I have a question, I installed everything and everything is showing in my game, but when I place new venue, massage table and new lounge chairs are not placed, they are in build/buy mode, but they are not placed in new venue (instead of massage table, there is a sofa -.-) This has happened to me a lot times, in pets venue, regency arcade,... Can somebody tell me how to fix this? Thank you! :)"
,Pluup,2012-08-25T22:58Z,"You need to update your Sims 3 game to version 1.36.4 in order for Sunlit Tides to install. Since there isn't a straightforward crack for this update, I recommend simply downloading The Sims 3 Diesel Stuff Pack and using the cracks torrents include with that content. Even if you didn't want the Diesel Stuff pack, at least you can play the game with Sunlit Tides. "
,kakosenazvati,2012-08-26T00:01Z,"thanks for trying to help, but I already have Diesel stuff and I updated my game to 1.36 but still no luck, I reinstalled the world 15 times, but it is not working... I am looking on google for fix, if somebody finds it before me, please post the link. Thank you! :)"

,marcusprime,2012-08-26T01:38Z,"For those having issues with the sauna and whatnot, this is an issue EA is aware of, and is trying to fix."
,kakosenazvati,2012-08-26T02:26Z,"ok I fixed my problem, I just had to decrapify this sims3pack :)"
,Crocrash320,2012-08-26T23:59Z,AMAZINGLY AWESOME !
,missgothika,2012-08-27T05:09Z,"Works great! thanks to @kakosenazvati and her/his suggestion of using decrapify. Plus, you have to have the ""play without custom content"" unchecked."
,SimKelly91,2012-08-27T08:41Z,"Thank you so much for the world but the 2 premium contents does not work properly. 

1st : Sauna - NO INTERACTION
2nd : Massage table - works perfectly but no moodlets... 

Please make a fix.... thanks :D"
,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-08-27T10:19Z,is this the standard w/premium items or gold edition?? and thank you for uploading this :)
,kakosenazvati,2012-08-28T13:05Z,"@SimKelly91 whenever store items are not working correctly in the game, you should put these KT store fixes. They are updated whenever something new is out in the store, and they are great because they fix everything that is not working :) here is the link: http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/index.php?topic=21330.0"
