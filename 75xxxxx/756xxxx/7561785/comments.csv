,fflaw,2012-08-24T09:27Z,"I figured out why mine wasn't installing/working. The buddha.dll file isn't transferring over due to being locked out by Microsoft Security Essentials (it might also be locked out by other anti-virus/firewall type things).

,Metalnat111,2012-08-24T09:41Z,"Guys!! It FINALLY worked for me. 


Yes, all it takes, to have Steam installed. As soon as i installed Steam, the loading  screen was no longer stuck whereas i could straight away see the logos, and all. To finally play the game at the end : - ) 


So yes, install steam, and the game will definitely work. 

CONFIRMED! "

,Scrapith,2012-08-24T11:17Z,"downloading this now..

not sure about this, however the problem with steam *MIGHT* be related to its install path.

the hitman sniper challenge crack is the same (not sure about crackfix version), however that game would not load until steam was installed in c:programfiles (x86)steam   on 64 bit win7
most likely need c:programfilessteam on 32bit

its worth a shot anyway if you have it installed elsewhere."

when your anti virus goes off its saying malicious software...

its not saying there is a trojan virus that will infect and destroy your operating system.

its called a false positive. but if you would rather believe skull uploaders and the king of cracking games are trying to give you a virus then by all means stop downloading their free games."
