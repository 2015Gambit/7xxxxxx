A fascinating (and frightening) book.

Straight forward. Easy to read and understand. Book can be read in a few hours. The author is a former soldier and military analyst so he has a good understanding of the conditions that create civil war. The book was originally published in 1996 and now you see some of his predictions are coming true. I recommend the book.
