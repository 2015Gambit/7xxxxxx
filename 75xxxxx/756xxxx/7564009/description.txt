A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Real Magic at your Fingertips

Jeff McBride, renowned performer and one of the finest card manipulators of our time, teaches you the inside secrets of professional card manipulation. Routines, sleights, productions and flourishes are clearly taught and demonstrated, along with sample routines and the seasoned advice that only a working professional can provide. Many of these sleights and techniques have been closely guarded for years - never published, but only passed on from one professional to another. These can only be found exclusively on this set of studio - quality DVDs. Jeff leads you through each and every item, while giving you the little tips that make learning easier and performing more entertaining.

Never has video instruction been more valuable. You see how the sleights should look, precisely how they are timed and how they are performed in the real world. Now with the help of Jeff McBride, you can learn the baffling and sophisticated card manipulations you have always dreamed of performing!
