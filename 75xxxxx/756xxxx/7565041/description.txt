Fans of the Search & Rescue series from InterActive Vision A/S can now fly more than a hundred missions in the UH1 "Huey" helicopter, through the unfriendly skies of war-torn Vietnam. As a medical evacuation pilot supporting U.S. troops in Search & Rescue: Vietnam MED+EVAC, players experience realistic weather (clear, cloudy, fog, rain, or storms), authentic environments, graphics featuring dynamic lighting, vertex shading and high-res textures, and layered sound effects. Mission options include factors such as time of day (morning, midday, evening, or night), starting position (base, hovering, or mission site), and crash realism (indestructible or damage).
