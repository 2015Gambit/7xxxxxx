,mrsparkle6000,2012-08-27T12:55Z,thanks much peh - this update fixed the nvidia crash problem under mountain lion on my macbook pro.
,aldo45,2012-08-27T20:23Z,"@Mbradna - Same as any update my friend. Make sure you run a backup before you run the installer and you'll be fine.

This is confirmed working 100%

Thanks uploader.

For anyone who is not sure - This is a BETA build of 10.8.2. It's been officially seeded to devs for about a week or so now. It's not fake and works 100%. DO backup before you update though."
,mbradna,2012-08-28T05:45Z,"Well, thats a shame.. I didn't back my hard drive up. You live and you learn. "
,maniacpirate,2012-08-28T13:12Z,"can i have full facebook support in this update....i mean can i see my facebook notifications,friend request all these things..."
,aldo45,2012-08-28T15:42Z,"@Mbradna - And what? It didn't work? The reason you would backup is incase of problems. Did you have some issue? Live and learn? Backing up before major changes is computer literacy 101.

@maniacpirate - No. The Facebook integration for ML doesn't work like that yet. Yet. Google it and see here

,cnovam,2012-08-28T19:00Z,Funcionando sin problemas Gracias
,mbradna,2012-08-29T03:17Z,"@aldo45 - 101 of being a student, can't afford to back up my most of my hard drive. 
There seems to be no problems with this update. And if you want the full facebook notifications install http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7483392/OS_X_Facebook_integration_by_iMZDL
and then install this update, works almost perfectly for me. A few bugs, but I can't complain."
,dreamof3d,2012-08-29T05:00Z,"Hmmmm... I have a 2007 Quad Mac Pro, modded Chameleon boot loader to run Mountain Lion as my EFI is only 32 bit... This update indeed gave me FaceBook integration and even updated my address book with all my friends on FB... message center works great, even synced my calendar with friends birthdays, and events... clicking on a message takes you right to the FB post... pretty cool, Thanks :)"
