,ufodave1947,2012-08-24T03:44Z,The crack is no good. It gets stuck at the Loading screen.
,Metalnat111,2012-08-24T08:21Z,"And i thought it was just me. 


Yup! The crack is corrupted. As the game launches, the screen becomes pitched black, and stays like that until you shut down the game. 


So no. The crack isn't working. Please, new release or something : ["
,MechanicalWalrus,2012-08-24T10:03Z,This one does not work. The Buddha.dll file has a trojan on it.
,woshikevin,2012-08-24T12:25Z,"its working perfectly, just install steam, install the game, copy the cracks, just as simple as usual."
,MechanicalWalrus,2012-08-24T14:33Z,It is not. Budda.dll is a virus. Do not download this.
,Superduperhawkffire123,2012-08-24T14:58Z,Am i able to play multiplayer/online?
,ufodave1947,2012-08-24T21:02Z,"Correction: the crack does work, but you must have Steam installed for it to work."
,Wuterbear,2012-08-25T07:34Z,This was the one I got working following the usual steps. Never had a virus warning. Already had Steam installed so no issue there. Currently at Chapter 5 with no problems. Thanks for the awesome upload Tikasukaz!
