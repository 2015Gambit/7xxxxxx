OK, we're going to try this one again. The last one started working and then "failed" for some reason. I didn't really know what I was doing then, so I kind of, ya know, ignored it. But that torrent received a comment saying they were "stuck", so it's clear that it isn't working properly. Here is a "re-seed" and I will ask that the first attempt be deleted.
