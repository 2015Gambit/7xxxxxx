,Pappar999,2012-08-26T02:55Z,Just that I have the two dlcs. And it's only one file so I guess I have to download it all. 
,Punisher2345,2012-08-27T10:56Z,It taking me a fucking full day to install and its stuck at localized_english_iw02.iwd for more than 13h... Does anyone had the same prob?
,Crusisx,2012-08-27T18:44Z,"@Punisher2345

close Get MW3.exe and Rerun in it will continue where it left off after checking for all the missing files"
,Punisher2345,2012-08-27T19:17Z,"@Crusisx

I just used the reloaded version of the file that i had and paste it in the main folder and now its installing the rest of the files :) Still taking a damh long time"
,Punisher2345,2012-08-27T20:44Z,"Ok finally ended up installing the multiplayer seems really better than the lazy teknogods that's still stuck in 1.4, but in Survival mode there are no maps from the DLC's (that there are in MP) and my name is *Reloaded*
How do i change this?"
,Crusisx,2012-08-27T23:58Z,"@Punisher2345

there was a file that had the name Reloaded inside, can't find it anymore, o.O i will keep looking"
