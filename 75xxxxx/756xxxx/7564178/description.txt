Technicians on an oil rig monitor a high-tech attempt to reach the world's largest oil reserve; an eighty billion barrel reservoir one hundred miles beneath the Mid-Oceanic Ridge. Something goes terribly wrong and the resulting explosion unleashes a tsunami that slams into the tropical island of Kontiki destroying it completely. At the same time, 2,000 miles away in Siberia, the town of Moltov is swallowed by a giant sinkhole. Scientists at the U.S. Geological survey are at a loss to explain the events. The only possibility is that a previously ignored warning from disgraced geologist, Brian Gordon suggests that, a disruption within the Earth's mantle beneath the Mid-Oceanic Ridge could cause a chain reaction of such massive proportions that it would tear the entire planet apart.
