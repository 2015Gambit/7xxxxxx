This is a home-made DTS 5.1 surround version of Greg Laswell's amazing album Landline.

IMPORTANT: In order to play these files, you MUST have a PS3 and a DTS 5.1 surround sound system.  THESE FILES WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A PS3!!!

To play: navigate to the VIDEO section on the XMB (the PS3 reads these as video files, NOT audio files...but they work, trust me).

Enjoy!  I hope you guys like it.  Be kind, this is my first run at a surround version.  I think it sounds great.
