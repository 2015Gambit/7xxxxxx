ADSPY/ - Adware/Spyware

This class of detection flags software that display ads, usually in the internet browser by modifying displayed pages or opening aditional pages with ads, and/or monitor and send information about the user's activity. These adware/spyware programs are usually installed by the users themselves or come with other software that the users install themselves (usually in exchange for using the software for free or as a default install option).

Users might be unaware that this software was installed or of its behaviour. This detection is meant to flag the file and the behaviour as part of legitimate ad displaying/user activity monitoring software.

This detection can be disabled and is recommended if the user is aware of the software installed on his/her system and doesn't want this type of software to be detected. 
Method of propagation:
   â˘ No own spreading routine"
