Tired of shitty uploads of books without layout, formatting or tags? Yes? I am too. Which is why I have decided to create this torrent of the entire Percy Jackson and the Olympians series; with proper formatting, layout, table of contents and metadata (for both iTunes and Calibre). Any missing chapters which may have been previously present have been manually added in by me. These are probably the best copies of the books you'll find on the web.

This upload does not include Rick Riordan's books from his new series Heroes of Olympus; which is continued off from the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I may upload them in a later torrent.

Formats provided are:
