Studio One Sound (Soul Jazz) [VBR] {MKOP}

Knowledge of Studio One is integral to an understanding of reggae. More than any other Jamaican production stable, Studio One was a crucial force during the 1960s and 70s, being the true home of ska and a hugely important site of early reggae.
LondonΓÇÖs Soul Jazz began an association with Studio One founder Clement Dodd during the 1990s, helping to introduce this great music to a whole new audience. DoddΓÇÖs death interrupted the release schedule, but Studio One Sound shows that things are back on track. ItΓÇÖs a sublime set of little-known material from the labelΓÇÖs heyday.

It opens with Hip Hug, Slim SmithΓÇÖs wonderful rock steady dance tune, which is followed by the extraordinary funk-roots of Good People, an exceptionally rare 1979 offering from Ras Michael and the Sons of Negus. Lord TanamoΓÇÖs Keep on Moving is an alternate take of Jackie MittooΓÇÖs Totally Together, and The Wailing SoulsΓÇÖ Trouble Maker has the harmonic brilliance that made their name. Elsewhere, Rita MarleyΓÇÖs Call to Me reminds of her early renown, and Johnny OsbourneΓÇÖs All I Have Is Love is absolutely chilling. But the cheesy version of Smokey RobinsonΓÇÖs I Second That Emotion is pure novelty-value stuff ΓÇô credited to The Martinis, it features Bajan singer Emile Straker.More noteworthy highlights include Irvin BrownΓÇÖs falsetto party tune, Run Come, The HeptonesΓÇÖ stunning Give Give Love, Jackie OpelΓÇÖs ska-gospel The Lord Is With Me, and Ken BootheΓÇÖs heartbroken I Am a Fool. Larry MarshallΓÇÖs take on The GayladsΓÇÖ ThereΓÇÖs a Fire is full of emotion, and Freddie McGregorΓÇÖs wonderful Homeward Bound is yet another standout, as are a few splendid instrumentals.

Liner notes by discographer Rob Chapman add context, albeit despite minor errors, and the sound quality is occasionally a bit muffled. Also, why a photo of Dennis Brown during his A&M phase was chosen for the front cover, when he does not appear on the disc, is something of a mystery. But the exceptional track selection, masterfully chosen by Oxman of Dub Vendor, makes this one a winner in every sense.~Natalie Shaw
