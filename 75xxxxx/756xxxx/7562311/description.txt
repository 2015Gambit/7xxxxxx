Reuploaded due to previous one being corrupted -- really sorry to those who started downloading.

********I WILL BE SEEDING 24/7*******

This is an easy torrent to get Logic Pro 9.1.7 running. It's just Logic Pro -- there isn't any additional Logic Studio content. 

It's Mountain Lion compatible, tested on my machine, and I've used lots of knowledge from people far cleverer than I to get this working. I hope this helps a lot of people. 

There are four stages to this:

1) Double-click 'LogicStudio.iso'. Once it's mounted, double-click 'Install Logic Studio', and use the serial code: E-342-PXV-169-TMH-378-IKJ-435-KXZ-FFS-41PX. Enter your first name & surname. You will also have to deselect the 'Logic Studio Content', else it'll ask for DVDs. 

2) Once it's installed, install the 'LogicPro9.1.7Update'. 

3) Once the update has been installed, drag the 'Logic Studio System ID' and 'ProAppsSystemID' to the following folder: 

Volume/Library/Application Support/ProApps

When prompted, ensure you overwrite all the files. 

Also remember that 'Volume' is your hard-drive (usually called Macintosh HD).

4) Enjoy Logic Studio!
