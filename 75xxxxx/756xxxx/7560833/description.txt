A powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastropheΓÇöand built her back up again.
 
At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington StateΓÇöand to do it alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than ΓÇ£an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.ΓÇ¥ But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone. 
 
Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail. Told with great suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.

ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs not very manly, the topic of weeping while reading. Yet for a book critic tears are an occupational hazard. Luckily, perhaps, books donΓÇÖt make me cry very often. Turning pages, IΓÇÖm practically Steve McQueen. StrayedΓÇÖs memoir, Wild, however, pretty much obliterated me. I was reduced, during her bookΓÇÖs final third, to puddle-eyed cretinism. I like to read in coffee shops, and I began to receive concerned glances from matronly women, the kind of looks that said, ΓÇÿOh, honey.ΓÇÖ To mention all this does Strayed a bit of a disservice, because thereΓÇÖs nothing cloying about Wild. ItΓÇÖs uplifting, but not in the way of many memoirs, where the uplift makes you feel that youΓÇÖre committing mental suicide. This book is as loose and sexy and dark as an early Lucinda Williams song. ItΓÇÖs got a punk spirit and makes an earthy and American sound. . . . Wild recounts the months Strayed spent when she was 26, hiking alone on the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State. There were very frightening moments, but the author was not chewed on by bears, plucked dangling from the edge of a pit, buried by an avalanche or made witness to the rapture. No dingo ate anyoneΓÇÖs baby. Yet everything happened. The clarity of Ms. StrayedΓÇÖs prose, and thus of her person, makes her story, in its quiet way, nearly as riveting an adventure narrative as Jon KrakauerΓÇÖs Into the Wild and Into Thin Air. . . . Her grief, early in this book, is as palpable as her confusion. Her portrait of her mother, who died of cancer at 45, is raw and bitter and reverent all at once. . . . Wild is thus the story of an unfolding. She got tougher, mentally as well as physically [and she] tells good, scary stories about nearly running out of water, encountering leering men and dangerous animals. . . The lack of ease in her life made her fierce and funny; she hammers home her hard-won sentences like a box of nails. The cumulative welling up I experienced during Wild was partly a response to that too infrequent sight: that of a writer finding her voice, and sustaining it, right in front of your eyes.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇöDwight Garner, The New York Times
