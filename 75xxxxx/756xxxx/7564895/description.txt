Although the content of previous editions has been substantially revised, it is remarkable that the overall purpose of this textbook has not changed since the first edition 18 years ago. The editorsΓÇÖ intent for undertaking the third edition of Geriatric Physical Therapy is to assist the development of reflective physical therapists who can use the available scientific evidence and objective tools to integrate health and functional status information with examination data, formulate an accurate diagnosis, and design effective treatment plans that can be
implemented at all levels of care and across all settings to produce optimal outcomes. We further believe that this practitioner can serve both patients and society as an informed advocate for older adults. What has changed throughout the years is that the original publication was intended only as a textbook for entry-level students. In the intervening years we have expanded the vision of this
text to include individuals studying for the examination to be certified as geriatric clinical specialist as well as practicing clinicians. The last group is perhaps the most surprising and the most gratifying. Geriatric physical therapy has come into its own in the last two decades. The emergence of the specialty, the growth of certified specialists, and the number of practicing clinicians in the area all attest to the fact that physical therapist practice oriented toward older adults is no longer a novelty, confined to a few physical therapists whose good hearts and
intentions led them to concerns about AmericaΓÇÖs aging population. On the contrary, geriatric physical therapy is bursting with innovation in practice and cutting edge
research that will enable physical therapists to exercise the full range of their education, experience, and expertise across the full continuum of the health care system from primary prevention to end-of-life care.
