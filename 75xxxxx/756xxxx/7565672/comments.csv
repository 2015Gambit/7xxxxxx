,torrent-cracker,2012-08-25T01:05Z,"The release name was originally ""Juvenile - Animal bw Sets Go Up"", but this isn't true, as it doesn't contain any version of ""Sets Go Up"" but 2 versions of ""Holla Back"" instead. I don't usually edit descriptions except the stupid ASCII art, but in this case I had to correct the whole tracklist (copied from discogs). Another lame-ass release from another lame-ass team. And they dare write shit like this:

We DO NOT rls our stuff for the public, and we DO NOT rls our stuff so you can get this shit for free! If you LIKE it, go and BUY IT!

Fuckers, learn to make correct descriptions first and then tell us what to do! Fuck the scene!

P.S. The 'pella is clean, Juve *is* a bitch ass nigga after all."
