Thanks  MsFenmore :)"
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-25T11:56Z,"I do not want to be rude by asking you this:
just out of curiosity...
why sometimes you upload the file early in the morning
and sometimes late at night
and of course sometimes in the afternoon?"
,bleslie1,2012-08-25T12:21Z,"wow, loving the early upload today MsF! :)

i don't mind that your upload schedule changes from day to day. i just check in whenever im online till the episode shows up. :P"
,Nemi9991,2012-08-25T12:23Z,"Maybe she has a job that makes her upload-times unstable :) You know, working shift :)"
,Nemi9991,2012-08-25T12:27Z,"Anyways MsFenmore, I don't know what I would have done without you. I used to watch B&B every day where I live, and they suddenly took it off the air to launch it on the channels website instead, for a fee.... Like wth? Their excuse was that it didn't have such a high audience, but give me a break... imo it was because they want all housewifes, or ppl that are able to see it every day, that they have to pay to watch it. They even replied that if 'old-grandma' still want to watch it, should could 'just' learn how to use the internet... Anyways, thank you soooo much MsFenmore, you're awesome!!! "
,Nemi9991,2012-08-25T12:37Z,"I wrote 2 messages here, but they're both gone? Why's that? anyone?"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-25T12:38Z,"LOL..thatÂ´s not rude..that depends on my work schedule...when I have the day off, I post it in the morning..when I have the early shift I post it in the afternoon, if I have the late shift ( 8.30 pm) itÂ´s coming later in the evening..!! "
,Nemi9991,2012-08-25T12:41Z,Hmmm... my messages only pops up again when I write a new message... strange... Then they dissapear when I refresh the page... Anyone else have that problem? Is it possible to delete old messages you wrote btw? 
,Dimmis80,2012-08-25T13:10Z,"Hey guys.Just some thoughts of mine about our show for anyone that interested.First of all it seems to me that the story of the trio Hope-Liam-Stefy it will finaly and i say again finaly will go to an and.!Christ i don't have anything bad about the actors play those 3 guys but its getting to long and its the only thing that we have for so many months.!!Hope finaly realizes that Liam has more and stronger feelings than her,not to mention that he is not ready to marie any of the 2 girls and ofcorse Hope loves mariage and stuff and Liam he must first grow up and be a man and then trie his luck with Stefy witch btw i am not very sure if they have a future together because of their crazy-reclesh and more characters.!And i think that Hope she must not listen to her mather because she is a totaly bad influence and stuff.!And Hope must not reconsider and finish things with Liam.Now the most of u already know all about Ronn Moss-Rigde leaving the show in September.!Man that was a socker.!One of the 4 not 3 musketeers of the show 25 years now in the front lines lives the show.It looks like about the money but it may be that the guy its kinda young and needs to trie new things.Anyways we must leave without the dude especialy the ladies some of u still like him and stuff.The second and even bigest sock.!!Sussan Flanery-Stephanie is leaving the show.I just love Stefy.She was and she is still is the stonger charachter of the show.And the show will never be the same without her.And ok the woman is 70 or something and is time to take a break but i will miss her.I hope not to die in the story of the show i mean and stuff so we will have them for some quest role family things.God bless u Stefy.So now we have Brook witch she will play for sure for another 2 years with new contract and i hope we will not listen about Eric.Dark times for the show for sure.It wiil continue at least for 2 years and i hope for many long but what about its future without the 2 guys and in 2 years without 3 of them.!!I don't know,we will sure,God bless MsFenmore to will see.And finaly there is not a mention about Nick-Jack Vagner and Jackie-Leslie Ann Dawn.!!They are out of the starting lineup of the actors and its been out of play for months.!Gone to.!?Its crysis thing,very low budget but i had the impresion that in bold they were ok..Anyways finaly i now hope for some good storie happens with Ridge and he might come back who knows and again Liam go to a trip or something mate smoke a cigar or something but chill out dude.!Very sorry for the big post but i am a fun of bold for over lets say 20 years and i needed to say something from my point of view.I hope for the best for the show..http://soaps.sheknows.com/boldandbeautiful/comings_and_goings/"

I would like to know that too.
I mean how can you delete your comment.
to MsFenmore
Thank you for replying to me :)
and thank you so much for keep uploading them!"
,atzensuisse,2012-08-28T11:04Z,"Dimmis80: Very pertinent observations, yeah we all hope the show will go on, with or withoutt Ridge or Stef Sr.!!!! But they will be missed :-and yes the Liam-Stef-Hope triangle is becoming tiring to say the least!!! Time the scriptwriters thought up some new angles, fresh ideas and direction into the show-or the ratings will drop & the plug will be pulled!!! As an aside, we're still wondering when Deacon Sharpe will be  back as if he was re-injected back into a pivotal role on the show:-patching things up with Hope, etc., then that'll give the story a whole new twist to the story, as we all know how Brooke reacts whenver D.S. is within 100 sq miles of her!!!!!! Anwyay have a great day guys, and enjoy the show while it's on!!! "
