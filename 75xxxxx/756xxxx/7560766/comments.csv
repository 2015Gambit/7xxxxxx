I really appreciate what you do!!

Has anyone seen the new
Brothers McClurg album
Join in the Sound? ? ? "
,ImmenseDisciple,2012-08-24T01:00Z,"Hi TT! Well, you absolutely excelled yourself with my last request, so here's a real challenge for you - could you possibly upload a new world son discography? I can't get hold of aaaaaany of their stuff, and that which I've heard is great, so it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for all your efforts :)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-24T02:57Z,"Blindark, I didn't realize Brothers McClurg had a 2012 release.  Let me look into that you for, and if I find something, I'll be sure to include it in my 33rd bundle."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-24T03:00Z,"ImmenseDisciple, according to wiki, NewWorldSon has four albums available.  They may have more, but again, wiki cites four.

Do a search on NewWorldSon here on The Pirate Bay and you will see a three album discography I uploaded some time ago.  The fourth album can be found in one of these 32 2012 bundles, which I didn't yet have at the time of creating that 3 album discography."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-24T03:08Z,"ImmenseDisciple, I just did a little searching for you, and the 2012 NewWorldSon release of ""Rebel Transmission"" can be downloaded from my 11th bundle."
,defenseor,2012-08-24T07:43Z,"Do you have FFH's 2011 album, One Silent Night? Didn't see it in your FFH collection or any of the 2011 bundles. "
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-24T17:07Z,"Defenseor, I took a peak and I still don't have that 2011 FFH album in my collection.  Nor can I seem to find a copy anywhere.  Sorry about that."
,ImmenseDisciple,2012-08-24T22:46Z,"TT - Thanks, I'd always been searching for ""New World Son"" which fails to return the appropriate torrents. Thanks!!!"
