What I did was take all the extra packs files (the ones that have maps and objects) and when I want one I just import it. You can start a new file in E3D of your own and save the files there."
,shmir,2012-08-26T19:19Z,"Dear skoxpress
When I try to import from the Scene Setup interface, it doesnt ""see"" the .e3d or.obj. What I have in the folder are just jpgs and the .epack extension which I cant figure out how to import. Can you be so kind and do a step by step for us?
Thank you!"

,Flyinglow,2012-08-27T03:18Z,Hey... I am getting A debug window popping up and even if I uninstall and re install it is still there. Any Idea? Thanks.
,skoxpress,2012-08-27T03:49Z,"Wow-what a trip! You find your ""Models"" file. Mine was D/users/myname/My Documents/VideoCopilot/
and load the files there.
  The models show up in the ""Model Browser"" and from the ""Edit"" column double click on ""none set"" and get the material by clicking down arror and ""Load from File.."
