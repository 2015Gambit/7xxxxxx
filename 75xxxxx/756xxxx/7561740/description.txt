Fixed this time:

    Fixed a client crash on exit (after connecting to a server using sv_pure)
    Added sv_namechange_cooldown_seconds, to throttle clients from changing their name too rapidly. (Defaults to 20 seconds)
    Added sv_netspike_on_reliable_snapshot_overflow to selectively enable the automatic dumping of netspike file if a client drops due to "reliable snapshot overflow" (defaults to 0, which disables the debugging)
    Added check to prevent player names from containing color codes
    setinfo console command will now reject attempts to set / change convars with any unusual characters
    Marked mem_force_flush as a cheat to prevent client exploits
    Fixed %n console crash in the client
    Updated client rate value to default to 30000 to improve network performance for most players
    Rate was previously set by SteamΓÇÖs Internet connection speed setting
    Updated client rate value to be stored in the config.cfg file
    Fixed a Linux dedicated server crash on exit
