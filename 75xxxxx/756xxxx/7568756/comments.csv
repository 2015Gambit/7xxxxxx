Enjoy."
,iam6UN,2012-08-25T22:18Z,"tikasukaz,

After running .exe nothing happens...the game not start at all. And of course the hkgame.exe is blocked and budha.dll is allowed in firewall...and i don't even have a antivirus software..."

PS. 3DM version runs without issues...must be SKIDROW guys miss some checks :)"
,Matinator10,2012-08-25T22:55Z,"@chujkurwa
Because it's extracted, and original scene release was rar'ed"

[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-26T00:23Z,"Can you guys read before commenting ?



Remember to block game in firewall. and allow our buddha.dll access
through your antivirus program, or else game will not work"
,dubai1991,2012-08-26T03:53Z,works absolutely fine for me.....
,dubai1991,2012-08-26T03:57Z,u need to have steam installed on your computer to run the skidrow version
,TaleMunja,2012-08-26T18:12Z,"@PrithviXXX
It works dude, thank you.

 @people who use his help but say nothing in return

 Saying ""Thank you"" will not kill you. 

See? I am still alive..."
,thcfreak666,2012-08-26T18:34Z,Works but lags after 5min gameplay with nvidia GTX570
,StormSG,2012-08-26T19:13Z,"Does not work, I add entire folder to exceptions of antivirus, and even turn off my antivirus but still gives me a white screen and ""HKSHIP has stopped responding..."" when i try to start it. "
,OmniNegro,2012-08-26T19:33Z,"I am sorry to announce that TaleMunjo died minutes after posting those dreaded deadly words...

Not really. But damned right about thanks. :)"
,WhigBullMoose,2012-08-27T02:37Z,"Still can't get it to run. Added buddha.dll to exception list and blocked the game on my firewall but when I try to run the game a window opens for the game but I get ""HKship.exe has stopped working"" message almost immediately."
,jmdaemon,2012-08-27T08:51Z,"The crack works fine... you MUST have steam installed for the game to run though, it apparently is looking for some registry entiees from steam and will do nothing if they are not there. I am fairly certain I have had steam running in the past but I just ran it and it updated and re-installed itself and sleeping dogs worked perfect after. also this version of the crack has made no attempt to get online. 

Getting avast to leave the crack alone is another problems. 

BTW im not sure if its an issue with the crack, but hitting SHIFT and UP to get the high bar in karaoke is not working."
,Performer81,2012-08-27T13:27Z,"When i press new game it just jumps back to my desktop. I blocked the game and allowed buddha dll, i did everything right and tryed just every crack available here. I just doesnt work."
,Performer81,2012-08-27T13:39Z,Doesnt work. Did everything exactly as explained but when i klick new game it just jumps back to the desktop.
,The4X3R,2012-08-28T05:48Z,"I already reinstalled the game multiple times 'cause of skidrow's not-working crack, won't do it again"
,Hani66,2012-08-28T13:59Z,"This crack works fine. I got a prob in game, when I press ESC then game gonna close, any one can help? "
,barrador,2012-08-28T18:27Z,"I'm having problems when i enter vehicles, the game frezzes...anyone having the same thing?"
,Cyrois,2012-08-31T02:48Z,"awesome, wasn't working before, getting same white screen as everyone else, this solved my problem by just replacing the files. THANKS"
,sapulha,2012-09-10T17:24Z,"it works, but only for 15min or so, then crashes to desktop without any warning or error message."
