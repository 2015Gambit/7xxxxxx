Would you like to post a similar screed detailing the offshore accounts, the rapacious and unscrupulous financial shenanigans, and tax avoidance schemes of the opposition candidate, or the plans of his running mate to give private health insurers the bonus gift of the century by gutting Medicare and Social Security and turning it all over to their business cronies?

No, I suppose not.  If I were you, I'd hide in the basement so the UN's black helicopter squads can't find you."
,dielec,2012-08-26T01:07Z,"@Lemon: What about the raiding of 716 billion dollars that O-dumbass stole to help fund obama care, don't want to talk about that one?? Also just because Harry Reid made a baseless allegation against Mitt's tax records doesn't mean Mitt has to release his records, just because some fool in the senate makes a statement saying Mitt hasn't paid his taxes the past 10 years does NOT make the allegation TRUE. 
That would be like me saying LemonJ-Lo you rape and torture little children in your basement. 
Now that I said that, it must be true... right!??!"
