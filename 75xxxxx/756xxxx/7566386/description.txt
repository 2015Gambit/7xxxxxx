This is a 1080i version of the August 24th, 2012 edition of WWE Friday Night Smackdown. 

*Note- this is the version that aired in the United States. I understand the file is big but that is because this is true HD without any converting. If people are able to seed and comment, I will do this on a weekly basis. If not, that's okay as well. I just wanted to share this as it was meant to be seen.

Some specifications:
1920x1080
20384 total bitrate
384 audio bit rate
