Manafest, is a Canadian Christian rapper and rock artist from Pickering, Ontario. After a skateboarding accident in 1998, Manafest took time to focus on rap and was noticed by Trevor McNevan of the Ontario-based band Thousand Foot Krutch. This led to his signing with an internationally distributed label, BEC Recordings under the Uprok Records label, and his debut release Epiphany. The album was made primarily of West Coast hip hop with several rapcore outings in the vein of Limp Bizkit, P.O.D. and Linkin Park. Manafest's second album, Glory, used a more purely hip hop style. On June 24, 2008 Manafest released his third official album, Citizens Activ, which went on to become his most successful album to date. The single "Avalanche" from his album, The Chase, debuted at No. 46 on the Billboard Christian Songs on May 29, 2010 being his highest and only charting song. Manafest's new album, Fighter was released April 10, 2012.
