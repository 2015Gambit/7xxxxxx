,zezant,2012-08-25T08:21Z,"I am from Croatia and I learned german in school.
I am happy that I can even communicate."

,runnaky,2012-08-25T13:29Z,"@kolozz its only been out for a day mate,no one made subtitles yet,easiest way to find out is to open it with bs player and put ur desired language and it autosearches every time u start the movie"

,llewu92,2012-08-27T18:16Z,Worth the download unlike the other blurry cams ou there!!!.....!!
,michaelrwatson,2012-08-27T22:31Z,"@zezant: Your English is actually very good then.

And... STILL precious few comments on the quality of this release. e.g. HOw is video--is it flicker-free? Cropping doesn't bother me, people walking in front of the camera don't bother me. But flicker sux. Thx.

,maliss619,2012-08-28T17:00Z,"CABLE PROVIDER SENT ME A NOTICE IMMEDIATLEY AFTER DOWNLOADING THREATENING TO PROSECUTE FOR DOWNLOADING

Otherwise quality isn't had for a movie cam"
,luciano.duarte,2012-08-28T23:42Z,"V=6
A=5"
,wendelj,2012-08-30T15:08Z,No cable provider sent you shit you douche bag. All providers have to be forced into that kind of action by a judge from a third party pushing the action you fool. Quit scaring people. 
,RipReviewer,2012-09-01T01:41Z,"V8A10 - I watched the whole thing, no noticeable problems that affected my viewing, good rip."
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-02T22:42Z,"WARNING: This has terrible flicker in many parts. Totally unwatchable for me, although some people (strangely) don't seem to be bothered by that. Check out the sample before downloading the whole movie. 

Btw, i am not complaining--I'm just saying this rip (like all others that are currently out) is unwatchable for me. It ain't 2002 anymore."
