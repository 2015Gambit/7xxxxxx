This practical handbook should be used by nursing students in clinical courses and by nurses in clinical settings as a quick reference. It guides the nurse in planning what needs to be assessed, monitored, treated, and taught at every stage of care, including pre-test requirements, intra-test procedures, and posttest care. This updated edition also will be helpful to all other healthcare professionals who need to know what nurses will do with their patients undergoing laboratory or diagnostic testing. All tests and procedures are listed in alphabetical order by their complete name for ease of location, plus the comprehensive, integrated index allows fast searches by abbreviation, synonym, disease state or condition, organ system, specimen type, or test classification.
