Its still in v1.2 so i think in the next versions it will get better and better"
,nazim12366,2012-09-15T02:18Z,"before i install i want to be sure, can you uninstall it?"
,nazim12366,2012-09-15T02:22Z,"never mind, for others here is the link for the app, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabelic123.desktop8&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nYWJlbGljMTIzLmRlc2t0b3A4Il0.
btw bobiras, you should include links of the app in the play store for you're future uploads, it would make it easy to see device compatibility, ratings etc."
