he talks about proof of abductions.. then why hasnt he heard of the aussie man that go a hair
and passed lie detector tests
and saying walton lie detector failed? what the hell he took 4 on separate occassions and passed them all..

anyhow the delonge guy was the best speaker in this
shame this interview panel wasnt long enough"
,SerSpec-V,2012-08-27T04:28Z,I'm so sick of the close minded idiots at Skeptic Magazine. They wouldn't believe in aliens even if they shook hands with one. According to them anything paranormal is a hoax or and imagination.

the shermer skeptic article

claim hes lying cos knew was loosing job and stunt
to sell to papers and cos he failed 2 lie detector tests.. or did he?
one was a game show stunt
and other cos he checked the questions before
allowing them for the test and held breath to
make it non conclusive

this is not what I heard previously with them all passing 16 tests.. like 4 each? so beats me

normally by now someone would of spilled the beams.. a group of 7 someone would of come clean so for now I says the event happened"
