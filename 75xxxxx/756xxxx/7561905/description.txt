Losing a smartphone or tablet PC is not just annoying for users ΓÇô it is also extremely dangerous. If the device falls into the wrong hands, strangers can easily access personal data such as photos or contacts and make online purchases via installed shopping apps ΓÇô at the victim's expense.

Smartphones and the like are most frequently lost in public places ΓÇô last year, at least 1,500 mobile devices were lost at Germany's largest airport in Frankfurt am Main (source: Fraport).

G Data MobileSecurity 2 provides reliable protection against mobile malware as well as real-time protection when surfing the net on a smartphone or tablet PC. In addition, users can block annoying callers and SMS senders, and contacts and their associated calls and messages can be password protected. Those who use their device for personal use as well as for work can thus protect their business contacts separately.
