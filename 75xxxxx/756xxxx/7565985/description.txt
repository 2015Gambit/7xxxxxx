Sorry they're late.
I'm in Tokyo, so I'm asleep when the files first come on line.

1. Amplified them just a bit.
2. Cut out all commercials (thanks to Captain77S for cutting half of them)
3. Added ID3 tags so they'll show up in an iPod (Hate looking under "Unknown Artist")
4. No changes to file names! (Thanks to Cap for putting the number at the beginning)
5. Removed superflous files ("Muslim in the White House" link, news, etc)

Thanks to Captain77S for the original files!
