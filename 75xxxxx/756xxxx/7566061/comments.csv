[T],CAPTAIN7SS,2012-08-25T20:13Z,hi again...something is wrong with the way these sound..are you recording it with your computer or with one of those online radios??..it sounds like you're using a microphone or your software is listening to the wrong input device to your soundcard....just guessing...i did the same thing...had me crazy..on yours it's almost like i can hear something running..like a fan in a computer..i did that with a setting on ''integrated microphone array'' and' wave mapper'' ..in the integrated microphone array setting i can pick up room noise and voices...had me crazy too till i figured what setting on my computer would be correct. what do you use...??
