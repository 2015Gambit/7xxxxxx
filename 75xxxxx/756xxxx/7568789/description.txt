KMichael Jackson ft Pitbull - Bad (Afrojack Remix)2012 Snippet




A brand new remix of Michael Jackson's legendary song "Bad" has emerged courtesy of Dutch EDM DJ Afrojack, rapper Pitbull and DJ Buddha, and AOL Music's TheBoomBox.com has an exclusive first listen. The effort is part of a special 25th anniversary edition of the King of Pop's seventh studio album. Titled Bad 25, the forthcoming LP debuts Sept. 18.

The new "Bad" remix features much more modern rhythms, a speedier beat and a heavier bass line in place of '80s-era synthesizers -- all the handiwork of Afrojack and DJ Buddha. Pitbull also raps brand new verses, calling his version of the song "a toast to the king for life." The track is truly a modern take on Jackson's classic song.
