Impressive, disturbing French ΓÇÿtrue crimeΓÇÖ film with a stunning central performance - refreshingly different from the usual crop of serial killer flicks.

Writer-director Cedric KahnΓÇÖs (LΓÇÖEnnui) Roberto Succo is an unusual serial killer film in that it studiously avoids the various paths taken by every other serial killer flick youΓÇÖve ever seen. This means: no painstaking detective work showing the cops identifying and then tracking their prey; a refusal to try and ΓÇÿexplainΓÇÖ the killer (itΓÇÖs based on a true story); and, most importantly, the majority of the killings occur offscreen, so thereΓÇÖs no gruesome fetishisation of the murders themselves.

WhatΓÇÖs left is a compelling, stark tale with no answers that is by turns fascinating and horrifying.

Excerpt from Matthew Turner's review at ViewLondon

***

Making his acting debut, Cassetti is frighteningly plausible as the real-life multiple killer of the title. He's first seen (years after the Italian cops discover of his parents' bodies) in a Toulon disco, where, he picks up a teenage girl who over the next few months shows remarkably little curiosity despite his strange and volatile behaviour. Indeed, his ability to continue killing, stealing and living out his strange fantasies is due partly to luck, partly to the shortcomings of others (including the cops), partly to his own extraordinarily uninhibited character. Kahn never opts for easy explanations but presents the facts coolly to subtly build up a portrait of the world where disorder rules, where notions of 'good' and 'evil' are finally so inadequate as to be meaningless. Tough, and very impressive indeed.
