It's the write idea. Handrite alows you to write with your finger right on your screen. Each time you lift your finger, the character or symbol you wrote appears in the notebook interface. It replicates exactly what you add to the screen. Give up the apper habit and keep, send, or post your notes.

You're in an important meeting or lecture when suddenly you realize--you forgot your pen or notebook! Or you're at a party and need to take down a phone number or an e-mail address. Don't trust your memory or try to scribble on a dry-cleaning receipt; Handrite is the solution you need.
