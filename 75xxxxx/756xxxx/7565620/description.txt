Xbox360 with Fall 2011 dashboard update will require you to play the video through windows media center and also requires a windows 7 computer.  You will need to configure the 360 as an extender and share your movies to it.  Your videos will play fine through windows media center on the 360 now.

The other work around to get your video to play via fat32 usb stick or streaming from windows media player would be to remux your video to a plain mp4 container.

This can be accomplished using ffmpeg and the following command line:

ffmpeg -i "my video.m4v" -acodec copy -vcodec copy "my video.mp4"

Otherwise you can attempt to use MP4Box or yamb.  Do not re-encode the video and audio streams as they are fine.
