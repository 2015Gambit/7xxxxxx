,xenoFLASH,2012-08-25T12:49Z,is holy roses back?
,albert2172,2012-08-25T17:23Z,"No. This is my version but same quality as HR. (we use the same encoder and same settings)

I just figured I would safe you guys time for encoding and have the quality at the same time ;)

P.S - if you guys downloaded it help me seed an comment on the quality. :) "
,xenoFLASH,2012-08-26T03:00Z,"Too bad the subs are not hard-coded. Would love to have this version.
Oh, well... "
,droop4,2012-08-26T09:55Z,"AMAZING QUALITY 
A: 8 (little low, but nothing iTunes can't fix)
V: 9 Crystal clear! "

They are soft subs and didnt want to go to encoding all over again for hardcoded subs. This is mainly ment for Apple TV and apple products. You can use handbrake if you'ld like to hardcode the subs. :p"
,xenoFLASH,2012-08-27T13:18Z,"I have handbreak, the only problem I have with it is keeping the resolution the same. I end up ruining the movie. aaugh
Any help would be greatly appreciated. unless the suggestion is to eat a bullet. i just don't see how that would work. :D"
,albert2172,2012-08-27T23:55Z,"@xenoFLASH

I would use MP4Box to burn the subtitles. in.  Its for windows - http://www.videohelp.com/tools/mp4box

Use mkvextract or  mkvmerge or anything else to extract the subtitles. And then once you have the subs use mp4box to burn em on the video ;)"
