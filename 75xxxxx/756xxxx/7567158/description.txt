Michael Owen is a football legend. On his debut for Liverpool against Wimbledon in 1997, Owen scored the first of his first-team goals, by the end of 2001 he had raised his tally to 100. In 1998 he became the youngest player of the 20th century to represent England, and by September 2001 his heart-stopping hat-trick against Germany propelled England's World Cup qualification bid. On top of the goals, Owen's accolades include the Young Player of the Year, BBC Sports Personality of the Year and European Footballer of the Year. Including all of his first 100 Liverpool goals, his hat-trick for England against Germany, plus interviews with his team-mates, and with Owen himself, this is the Official Liverpool FC Tribute to a genuine scoring sensation.
