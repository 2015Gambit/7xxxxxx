You're most welcome, and thank to you as well.

Yes, I do actually own physical copies of all the Sandman/Death Absolute books, but I'm not going to scan those. In fact, I'm surprised when scans of any of the Absolute books turn up. They cost WAY too much and look WAY too nice in their original form to be putting them through the pain and suffering involved with scanning books of that size."
