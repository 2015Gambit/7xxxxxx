[V],twentyforty,2012-08-25T12:13Z,"Said gazillion times, but worth repeating:

""For ones with/in doubts, ""inner"" questions and voyeur tendencies:

Get proper, good torrent-program
with MediaInfo plug-in, NFO viewer plug-in
and STOP asking for things already present.
Or get hell out of my torrents and choose ones you need.

So - here is no waste of dozens KB in page content just to
repeat content of NFO file.

It is not needed anymore.
It's archaic and obsolete.
Doing right-click in your torrent client is easier:

...and...

""Requests must contain IMDB link. Request must contain valid reason Why do you ask for it and do not go someplace else.
Re-seed requests must contain link to specific torrent.
Any type of Requests should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
Re-seed request should contain exact time and time-zone you're in. Google. My Time Zone is CET, so do the math before.
Re-seed time-window is 1 day. If you have slow connection meaning, you cannot finish download in that time-frame, just forget about re-seeding and especially loading of old, dead torrents.
Re-seed chances are good for single torrents within one year of original day of upload.
Chances for re-seed of Pack-torrents and single TV episodes are slim to none.
In short - if I have something (and is physically present) - I would definitely re-seed.
You should just ask - nicely, in civilized and aforementioned manner, of course.
If you've done something wrong on my torrents - ever - do not bother to ask.

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.""


NOTE: Before making fool of yourself (as lately many did) click  on ""Files"" (up there, not hidden)  and look what is in the torrent. If you want to see NFO or screen-shots - they are in the torrent. So, either get torrent program or plug-in for one you use with IMG and NFO viewer or - download .jpg and .nfo first and knock yourself out.

>""I dont want to use windows crap"" if you by that meant what is shown in screenshots - rTorrent is Unixoid application, and is written for Linux so far. Anyway, you can download NFO, right?"
,[qusawa],2012-08-25T13:26Z,"Well it time for you to understand that TPB have rules and you dont have the balls to change that fact!

The rule can you find : https://forum.suprbay.org/

And learn to show people respect !"

Spot on"
,[qusawa],2012-08-25T13:44Z,"Step 5 - Using The Description Wisely.

Include all essential information.
TITLE - This is the name of the movie. If you remember way back in Step 3, Rule 1 we found this sneaky but essential bit of information. Well with all that effort put into acquiring this morsel let's not be afraid to use it again. And remember that there is not character limit here, so add all of those rubbish crucial bits of information you were forced to pare down before.

IMDb Link - You can put the IMDb link in the description if you would like. If you couldn't find your movie on IMDb but did find it on another reputable site go ahead and put that link here.

Source - This is where you should tell the pirating world were you got the file. Did you make it yourself or did you download it from somewhere else? If you made it yourself, did you encode it from a DVD? LaserDisc? Capture it from the TV or off a VHS tape? Was it a retail (store bought) DVD or did you download a DVDR and encode from that? Perhaps you bought it from the guy on the street corner and edited out the parts with humping camels? If you downloaded it do you have the original nfo? If not just tell where you got it from and say you do not know the source. It's Okay no one will laugh, just be honest, after all this is file sharing, P2P is not an STD.

Video Details - Here it gets a little technical, but please bear with me, we're almost finished. You can download a program like gSpot or MediaInfo and export the relevant information for your post. Include things like the Video Codec, Resolution, Framerate, Avg. Video Bitrate, Bits/Pixel, Aspect Ratio, Audio Codec, Audio Bitrate and the number of Audio Channels.

Other Information - Include some non-essential information (if you must). Here is you chance to include all of the junk wonderful details that you wanted to put everywhere else. Here you can put the movie's description, actor's, and all the other information we already covered by linking to IMDb. But, of course, it's probably more valid if TPB's users get that info from you. You can also give your opinion on the film (if you've given all the actually relevant info). Tell us how fantastic the space monsters are, or how hot the leading actress is and what you pretend you are would do if you had her in you mom's basement apartment right now. And please, tell us the ending of the movie, in great detail, and what you would do different if only the studio would have given the 120 million US dollar budget to you instead of that Spielberg guy."

[V],twentyforty,2012-08-26T09:08Z,"He do not listen, he does not look. he does not understand a word we both said. He cannot even grasp where he is and what he has been doing week long - always asking the same and always repeating absolutely same shit.

He is, by definition, and by his actions a plain ""troll"" and he can see - nothing.

He keep pounding all my 720p uploads with ""minuses"", whenever he feels like. He keep wasting your and my time and bandwidth.

I just hope how someone of TPB staff would see what he, and all idiots together have been doing to uploaders, invoking in people worst possible, not to avoid specific torrents - because nobody gives a shit what some anonymous prick have to say or if some torrent even have votes or not - but to TREAT torrents what they by nature weren't - plain download way to fill their bellies and run away. Not to mention how 99.999% of downloaders do not even have account open, and are simply mute parasites. If they think good, but do nothing, even once every week say common Thanks, they allow  turning TPB in ultimate pig-hole and not ""a bay with scents of Sherwood"" as I said once, long ago.

I simply cannot understand such passivity, saying ""oh, battle is over, idiots won"". I do not understand origins of such defeatism. Is it originates in deep feeling how they are doing something ugly, bad or evil? How they rebel against some god (yes, I heard that too) and deeply feel like we got what we deserve? And give a shit about us, because of it?
Is it urge to rebel or love to do forbidden things their primary motivation?

I do have answers, but they are just mine. I have seen anything, have heard everything and felt every possible stunt they can pull and have done. And - as a result - I do not give flying fuck to opinions of total strangers, especially ones who say stupid, evil things and think how they are ""entitled"" or ""have rights"".

Nope, they have not. No living soul do not have right to say whatever shit crosses their mind and spell it out. Nowhere and never ever, in real world. What empowers people to become personification of evil hidden behind anonymity Internet provides.

They can listen simplest advice we both have given: ""Just - go. World is one click away"".

But - they can't. That's the whole problem."
