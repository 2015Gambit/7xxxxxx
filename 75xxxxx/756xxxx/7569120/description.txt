From the Royal Albert Hall, the London Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Vladimir Jurowski 
take us on a romantic and passionate journey with music by Tchaikovsky and Mahler 
Mezzo-soprano Alice Coote sings Mahler's Songs of a Wayfarer, inspired by the composer's own 
unhappy love affair. The concert ends with a performance of Tchaikovsky's Manfred, a 
highly-charged symphonic portrayal of Lord Byron's dramatic poem of the same name. 
Introduced by Charles Hazlewood.
