,shinobi741,2012-09-06T19:01Z,"@34lol22  You can open this file with Adobe Reader. It is a simple .pdf file.
Great Torrent! Thanks so much, will be seeding for weeks."
,34lol22,2012-09-06T20:09Z,@shinobi741 I tried opening with PDF reader and it gives an error because it says it's not a pdf file. 
,N00bun2,2012-09-09T21:01Z,"@34lol22 I guarantee it is a valid PDF file.  I created it myself with Fine Reader, GIMP, imagemagick and pdftk among other handy tools since the asshole publisher (Pearson) couldn't be bothered to offer their text book in a less DRM encumbered format I did that part myself.  Now if only enough people like me would do the same...  $130 for a text book is highway robbery."
