Guitar Hero III with metallica songs included.

To play the game you HAVE to have the Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock installed FIRST. Then just replace the whole guitar hero folder in the installation directory (ex. C:Program FilesGuitar Hero III) with the one you download and run the game as usual.

Enjoy! 

Few notes:

* in order to play the game on Windows 7 you need to run the .exe file in Windows XP compatibility mode.

* if there is some other problem (dll.. etc) try updating your DirectX ;)
