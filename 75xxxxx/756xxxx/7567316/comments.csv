,Sgt.Dude,2012-08-30T00:29Z,"So how will this work? Will I have the Metallica songs in Guitar Hero III, or will it launch a different game?"
,ThaDeth,2012-08-30T13:22Z,"As I said, you have to have the original Guitar Hero III legends of rock installed first, then replace the whole folder in program files (or wherever you installed the game) with the one you download from here. Then just launch the game ;)"
,szofer,2012-08-31T15:42Z,"Where is Mettalica songs? I download this, copy to GH3 folder, play and I do not see new songs, why?"
,ThaDeth,2012-08-31T19:16Z,"You are doing something wrong.

You know that you need to either remove or rename the original Guitar Hero III folder and put the downloaded one in it's place ? "
