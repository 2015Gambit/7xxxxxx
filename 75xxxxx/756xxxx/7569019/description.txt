In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews Steve Keen from Debtdeflation.com. It has been five years since global debt crisis began. The debt is now so great that it can no longer be hidden. Max discusses the issue with Steve to see what triggered the current debt crisis, what the response to it was and where we stand now. Steve also comments on the latest global debt crisis and banker's role in the current situation. Steve Keen is a professor in economics and finance at the University of Western Sydney and the author of Debunking Economics.
