Yes, this is the Owl City album ''The Midsummer Station'' but it sounds like a horrible pre-release web rip -- for FLAC it should sound a lot better.

Download this at your own discretion, but your better off downloading the album in 128 kbps mp3 quality elsewhere, as this is basically what this is, only with a tremendous file size."

Why don't you try uploading something instead of tearing down other peoples torrents.  This is a cd rip so I'm not sure why you're trolling."

You have a great track record! I'm downloading and will report back when I have time to listen."
