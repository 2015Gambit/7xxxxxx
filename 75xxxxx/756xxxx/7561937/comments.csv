Given you once were the supplier of these - I know I can trust you to reliably spread the love to others. I'll see what I can do about 21-33. Shouldn't be too hard, just tedious - so I'll upload in one go as one massive torrent file as opposed to 13. It'll take some time (coupled with my otherwise busy schedule) - so check back some time next week."
,thorhammer2000,2012-08-24T00:57Z,Hi raymond_u - many thanks for this. My email address is johnatcross ampersand gmail.com (if you see what I mean - I'm just trying to avoid it being collected by the spammers). It would be really useful to have a source for these - I don't mind uploading to TPB (my previous source dried up before which is why I stopped uploading).
,raymond_u,2012-08-24T01:55Z,"thor - do you mean johnatcross (at) gmail.com? Rather than ""ampersand"" which is actually this symbol: ""&"""
