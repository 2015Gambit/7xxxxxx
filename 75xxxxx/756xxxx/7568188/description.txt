New in R304 Drivers:
Adds support for NVIDIA TXAA
NVIDIA TXAA is new film-style anti-aliasing technique designed specifically to reduce temporal aliasing (crawling and flickering in motion) through a combination of hardware AA, custom CG film style AA resolve, and a temporal filter.
The Secret World is the first game to support TXAA. Read about it on GeForce.com.
TXAA is supported on GeForce GTX 600-series Kepler-based GPUs.
Learn more about TXAA on GeForce.com.
