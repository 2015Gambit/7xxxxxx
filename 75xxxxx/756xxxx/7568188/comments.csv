You are funny troll."
,xpmule,2012-08-26T21:23Z,"you should learn to accept critiscm rather than name calling like a baby.

I havn't said a single thing that isn't valid and you also have ignored every single question i have asked on your torrents..

you are an awful uploader.

Maybe go out and make friends instead of uploading useless crap to TPB for attention kid."

Maybe you are blind too.Check the torrent info.It says clearly its for nvidia 660.I accept critisism from big people than knows things.Not from stupid kids that all day just critisism and masturbate in  front of computer.I am a good uploader.People know that just see the comments.You are the only moron and stupid troll that spam my torrent.I have friends you have just your hand for masturbate right?Get ban better"
