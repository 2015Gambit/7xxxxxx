This is what it is?
The perfect timer - nothing more, nothing less.
Because time does not exist in itself, but is a product of representation, we like to represent it simply, easy as pie, beautifully, completely intuitive, and in Holo aesthetics.

What you need is what you get:
Cooking spaghetti or Beef Wellington? Need a countdown for launching your spaceship? Want to do 200 push-ups in less than a minute or see how far you can walk on your hands in two and a half hours? Need a 12min, 48sec nap? Must re-animate the overweight guy at the pawnshop? Preparing your speech before the World Congress of Philosophy?

Program your beautiful Holo Aesthetics timer with the easiest gestures imaginable. Use it on your phone or tablet. Save an unlimited number of timers with your own labels, use and re-use them over again. Even back up your timers with your Google account.
For all your work and play, for everything that counts.
