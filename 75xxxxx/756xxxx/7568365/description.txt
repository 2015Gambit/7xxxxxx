Summary:Live at the Opry is derived from transcript recordings Patsy Cline made between June 16, 1956 and March 23, 1962 on the Grand Ole Opry. The live album consists of twelve tracks of live material, which includes four of her major hits between 1957 and 1962: "Walkin' After Midnight," "I Fall to Pieces," "Crazy," and "She's Got You." According to Allmusic reviewer, Mike Henderson Cline sings a "wide variety" of songs on the album, such as Rock and Roll, Jazz, Traditional Pop, and Tin Pan Alley. Cline includes a cover version of Carl Smith's "Loose Talk" (which she had never recorded) and Hank Williams's "Lovesick Blues. The album also includes five additional songs from her years at Four Star Records, such as her debut single, "A Church, a Courtroom, and Goodbye," "There He Goes," and "How Can I Face Tomorrow."

Although originally released on a vinyl record in 1988, the album was soon available on compact disc and cassette. The cover art had originally been taken by Les Leverett and was digitally remastered by Glenn Meadows, Milan Bogdan, Jim Loyd and Benny Quinn at Masterfonics. Upon its release, the album peaked at #60 on the Billboard Magazine Top Country Albums chart.
