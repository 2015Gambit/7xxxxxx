So I got this free inside a Minutemen reissue vinyl I recently picked up.

If you consider yourself a punk rock, indien, or just another person who hates Justin Beiber, then you will probably like this.


The rip is 100% accurate with full confidence, ripped with registered dBpoweramp and the Log is included in the folder.

Enjoy!
