Info:

Padlocked doors. Strange light fixtures. Mutant cockroaches.
There are some odd things about NateΓÇÖs new apartment.

Of course, he has other things on his mind. He hates his job. He has no money in the bank. No girlfriend. No plans for the future. So while his new home isnΓÇÖt perfect, itΓÇÖs livable. The rent is low, the property managers are friendly, and the odd little mysteries donΓÇÖt nag at him too much.

At least, not until he meets Mandy, his neighbor across the hall, and notices something unusual about her apartment. And XelaΓÇÖs apartment. And TimΓÇÖs. And VeekΓÇÖs.

Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors. And all together these mysteries could mean the end of Nate and his friends.

Or the end of everything...

"A riveting apocalyptic mystery in the style of LOST."--Craig DiLouie, author of THE INFECTION and THE KILLING FLOOR
