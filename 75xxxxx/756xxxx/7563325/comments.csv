,ponknasty,2012-08-24T09:56Z,Playing this game offline is like shooting yourself in the foot before running a marathon. You may make it but it will be very difficult and painful.
,420bluntdragon,2012-08-24T10:42Z,"@ponknasty

Online or not, if you're playing this for the first time, it will be difficult and painful."
,420bluntdragon,2012-08-24T10:47Z,"@tikasukaz
Have you tried using gta4 or SFIV GFWL keys to activate this game for online? There's a bunch of people saying it works."
,ChiliNoMoreX,2012-08-24T11:00Z,just use the usual XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX serial and you're good to go
,cyborg34573,2012-08-24T13:17Z,"Btw guys make sure to get the resolution hack fix that's circling around, it will make the game's graphics MUCH MUCH better trust me.

Screenshots of my game atm. Insane improvement over default washed out bs.

Also forget playing with with KB/M, support for that is just horrible, kinda unplayable imo. Make sure you have a controller to play this game. A Xbox 360 controller is perfect for this. But yeah if you play with KB/M , you will actually see your mouse cursor move all over the place, there are ways to hide it but its a hassle, and the movement just sucks, ontop of that the Xbox 360 controller icons never go away even if you are using KB/M. Definitely needs controller.

So yeah , Resolution Fix + Use Controller = Awesome. Wont even feel like a bad port anymore."
,SHADOWLEXX,2012-08-24T14:55Z,Can i play this online with my legit STEAM-Key?
