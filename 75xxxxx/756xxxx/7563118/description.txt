Publication Date: December 27, 2005

The formal education of an electrical engineer is primarily mathematics and theory, with little practical information taught. Every beginning engineer needs a mentor to teach them the things that aren't taught in engineering school, but often lacks such a guide. This book fills that gap between theory and practice. Written by an expert electronics engineer who enjoys teaching the practical side of engineering, it covers all the subjects that a beginning EE needs to know: intuitive circuit and signal analysis, physical equivalents of electrical components, proper use of an oscilloscope, troubleshooting both digital and analog circuits, and much more.

*Covers the engineering basics that have been either left out of a typical engineer's education or forgotten over time.
