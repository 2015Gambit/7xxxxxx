(Whomever you are)

Islam of today is acting as Christanity did when their religion was only 1500 yrs old.

I never understand christains that have a higher standard for Islam, than they do for their own religion.  ??"
,sakstroy,2012-08-23T18:45Z,"Islam differs from christians in that it was very violent at first out of zeal for conversion and now out of fear from their men to lose the power over women and over people in general if they accepted people's individual freedom of choice, that's why islam today is a backward, negative religion, the only that denies the right to apostasy from its members, condemning them to prison or death, the only religion that has religion police and such."
,I_QBot,2012-08-23T18:58Z,"You are correct MrOpenMinded, the Crusades happened around 1000AD, with the idea to eliminate the Muslim Infidels. In the 1000 years since, however, most Christians and Jews have learned from those misguided ideas. It would be nice if in today's world, some radical Muslims would learn from those mistakes. Pity, they have not."
,pir8s007,2012-08-23T19:02Z,Such a religious or inflammatory torrent should be removed from TPB....   
,I_QBot,2012-08-23T19:35Z,"Why should this torrent be removed? Are you against open public discourse? Just because someone may object to the premise, this is not a reason to ban it. Part and parcel of a free and open society, correct?"
,pir8s007,2012-08-23T20:29Z,"@I_QBot

I support 'free and open internet' but not on these types of torrents..."
