Silk Soul Sessions is a new weekly radio show that will focus on showcasing the music and talents of the artists on this upcoming Booking Agency's line-up. The agency was founded and is run by the talented Miss Linda Kugler who will focus on not only obtaining one of the best rosters in the scene but supporting and promoting the artists outside of just the typical DJ gigs. Twice a month Silk Soul Sessions will bring in artists from the roster for a 1 hour exclusive DJ Mix while every other week the show will be hosted by the skilled Mr. Ramiro Filipe. With talent overflowing not just from the roster but the staff of Silk Soul Bookings, you can expect a quality and unique show every week, focusing on the Deep and Tech House sounds that give you goosebumps."
