,TyStark13,2012-08-26T00:34Z,Awesome. :) Would you mind doing Tokio Hotel & Black Veil Brides' ones? :)
[T],rjordan21,2012-08-26T13:26Z,"Both of Black Veil Brides' albums are uploaded in FLAC and seeded here already:

I don't have any Tokio Hotel and can't find FLAC uploads seeded anywhere.  Their discography is uploaded here in VBR MP3 though:
