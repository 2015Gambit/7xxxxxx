,Panda47,2012-08-26T08:04Z,"This thing had a glitch at the 2:30 minute mark, throws the the audio sync off for the rest of the movie.  But if you start the movie and FF past that timecode, everything is fine.
Other than that...

,damouse1,2012-08-26T15:38Z,"Superb image quality for sure, and no glitch here at 2:30 so that might have been a local phenomenon or perhaps even a bit damage in the download.

One niggle though, the image is slightly cropped from the original so it's not quite a 1:1 conversion. Not complaining, just not enjoying that.
No international subs, for those who'd want that."
,pepeOOX2,2012-08-27T03:24Z,"damouse1 it is cropped and changed the image proportions or only some parts of the sides are missing?, it is very slightly?. I had watched first minute (utorrent feature) and indeed the quality looks impressive. Also I liked than it looks like full screen without the up and down bars. (sorry for the english)"
