,Cubbie-Wan,2012-08-25T22:40Z,buddha.dll again with the trojan warning
,Cubbie-Wan,2012-08-25T22:42Z,Firts time in years my Kaspersky Internet Security has detected this kind of warning in a Skidrow game.
,Stefanovics,2012-08-25T22:50Z,"can someone get a CLEAN crack for this game?? Like someone get a clean for Hitman Sniper challange, because all the other cracks are contained the f*cking buddha.dll and with it
Win32:Malware-gen
Thanks"
,fishboy11,2012-08-25T23:23Z,you do realize that some game cracks cause false positives?
[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-26T00:20Z,"@fishboy11 

You are Correct, this is a false-positive. Some cracks are marked by anti-viruses.

Use ESET "
,DimmuEmperor,2012-08-26T02:06Z,"People just don't understand false positives in this world and believe whatever a program says it is thinking that that program is ""officially"" definitive upon what it is ""supposed"" to do. Seriously. It doesn't take a genius  on how to have a computer without a anti-wtfe fire-fuckyou or anything to know what is and isn't in the computer world. Get smarter and stop relying on programs. If you are afraid; then stop relying on torrents and or anything and get the real game and pay for it. You obviously pay for things in life and think you cant afford it; but can due to the fact of your ""invaluable spending"". God idiots on the internet never go away."
,LeoSky,2012-08-26T07:39Z,"""Crackfix"" my dick! This dont fix shit "
,timothyherry,2012-08-26T08:32Z,"still lag! so much lag, my comp have gtx 560, i7 @2.2 gHZ, ram 8 gb! still so much lag, maybe i will download reloaded version"
,Stefanovics,2012-08-26T11:31Z,"fishboy11:
False positives my ass, that file is a virus.
Virustotal clearly indicates dickhead.
DimmuEmperor:
Maybe i wouldn't rely on my antivir if some faggots didn't try to ruin my day by spreading dangerous programs you jerk, i had seen many viruses boy i can tell you, and what to belive? some faggots who said it's a false positive or virustotal that scans the file with all availible scanners and get a 78% infected message.

The best bet to wait a CLEAN crack like i waited for Hitman Sniper challange, and finally someone uploaded a clean version."
[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-26T16:05Z,"@Stefanovics

THIS IS CLEAN 

SKIDROW's release buddha.dll is flagged as virus. THOUGHT IT'S NOT.

Hitman Sniper challange Crack was released on TPB by myself and it doesn't have buddha.dll file in Crack that's why it looks clean.

I hope this clears."
,DimmuEmperor,2012-08-26T23:57Z,"@Stefanovics
I beg to differ that you even know what a ""Virus"" is because if you had a virus you wouldn't be typing atm when you even DL this crack...nearly all cracks and invalid DLL's a computer dont know (Thus this Buddah thing is new durp) flags it not knowing what it can be and just says oh it does this or that. Hell. The term you are going for right now is ""Script Kiddie Programs"" You never had a virus in your computer I assure you, or you would not be the only one suffering the dire shit it can cause....but please enlighten me and tell me what this ""Virus"" does..."
,LeoSky,2012-08-27T00:06Z,I gave my user full control over that buddha.dll file and everything worked. Thanks
,WaqasR,2012-08-28T14:29Z,"here is proper instructions
1 install game
2 add game into antivirus exclusions or disable antivirus
3 copy crack
4 install steam (just install no need to run)
5 enjoy play

this method is also for hitman sniper challenge"
