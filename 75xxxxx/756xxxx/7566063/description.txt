Plot: Michael and Cody are just like your average brothers. They live in a nice house, share a cramped bedroom, and fight about everything. In fact, the only thing that's not ordinary is, outside, the zombie apocalypse is raging on. Together with their father and wheelchair-bound companion, the brothers must face a whole new world of uncertainty when a mysterious woman is thrust into their midst.
