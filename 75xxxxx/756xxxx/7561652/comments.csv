,soundguyrob,2012-08-23T22:48Z,Anyone tried this? Did you do it over VMW 4? Or new install? 
,old_parr,2012-08-23T22:56Z,You can install it over the vmware fusion 4. I've installed it on lion and worked perfect.
[H],zMTz,2012-08-24T03:07Z,I'm assuming this isn't the professional edition. TYVM for the upload anyway :)
,soundguyrob,2012-08-24T03:13Z,"Yep, worked fine. "
,topjimmy68,2012-08-24T03:16Z,Installed on Mountain Lion over Fusion 4; worked fine.  When's Parallels 8 coming?
,old_parr,2012-08-24T03:22Z," zMTz: yes, its the professional version ;)"
,deksden,2012-08-24T09:25Z,Parallels 8 will be released 2012.09.04! 
[H],zMTz,2012-08-24T12:40Z,"@Old_Parr Yeah, just installed it. Awesome!

@deksden I've always preferred VMware over Parallels, but I'll check the reviews."

,rawkucing,2012-08-27T07:38Z,"works perfectly !!!!! 
Thanks a lot"
,Pirate Penguin,2012-08-30T09:04Z,"Hi everyone,

Torrent works flawlessly.
I've always liked Parallels better than VMWare. 
I mostly use this programs to be able to run a Blu-Ray Clone tool.
Well, with Parallels 7 and OsX Mountain Lion, no problems. 
Using VMWare Fusion 5.0, I still run into the same problems I've always had : REALLY SLOW AND SLUGGISH ACCES to devices (Blu-Ray) and share folders ! 
Makes VMWare almost impossible to use ! 

But that's a really specific need...

Regards."
