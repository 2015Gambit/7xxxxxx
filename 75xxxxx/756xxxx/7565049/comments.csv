[V],dynstab2,2012-09-12T15:13Z,"This text is indexed (and seeding) on a half-dozen torrent sites (another half-dozen more now) and can be downloaded directly via at least 5 valid public links to file dumpsites like rapidshare, mediafire(2), 4shared, filefactory and depositfiles. No wonder you can't look up this index not to duplicate my torrents with my very own files. Crybaby if you like but spoon-feeding not required, heh?"
