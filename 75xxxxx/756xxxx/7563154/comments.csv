http://thepiratebay.se/user/GlowGaze/

If not, GlowGaze upload all YIFY:s newest uploads, calling them his own. AND using them for marketing his own web site..."

,xtheghost,2012-08-25T03:44Z,"The quality of the video is awesome. Def one of the best rips available. The sound on the other hand, seems to be a little lower than normal for YIFY

V: 10
A: 7

Overall if you have a decent set of headphones, you won't mind cranking it up to hear everything, but if you're planning to watch this on just your laptop, you might be disappointed. "

,icek00l,2012-09-08T00:30Z,"kronos, you're a retard, yes it is 1080p res but the aspect ratio is 2.35:1 & NOT full 16:9, which will be beyond your comprehension"
,icek00l,2012-09-08T01:30Z,"great picture quality but terrible audio. I tried using equaliser etc. but whatever you do, the speech is always difficult to hear so have to put it on loud, but then when there's a loud bit of action it blasts far too loudly so have to mess around turning volume back down again.

This seems to be on many of YIFY's rips, I'm NOT ungrateful and for the file size the image quality is always great but I now look around for appx. 3-4gb size files for proper audio.

,garfiel,2012-09-10T04:48Z,"AUDIO VOICE PROBLEM and how to fix it.

Write to the people making the dam movies or producing the DVD's.

I have ripped hundreds of DVD's myself and whilst I only upload a few things myself due to bandwidth, I find too many movies where the background music just drowns the shit out of the voices.  Dammed annoying trend that has appeared  the last 10 years or so.  

For those that find the volume overall on some movies is lower than other stuff especially lower than TV series then try tweaking your

AC3 Filter

You can boost the volume there which may help with overall low volume but not low voice volume verses back ground sound.


Great rip as always, I am guessing the 18 people who left a -  rating for quality are bot's or jealous people trying to discredit yify's uploads.

So people if you like a torrent quality come back and click the + sign"
