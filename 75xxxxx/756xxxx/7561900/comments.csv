The last skidrow update is 1.13b - but the official update is 1.13e"
,Taosinky,2012-08-24T03:53Z,"@Whitebb : Maybee i am wrong, but ""Crossfire"" seams to be a [Stand Alone]. 

So no Jagged Alliance Vanilla needed.

,THUGzy1,2012-08-24T09:32Z,Viva la Skidrow! Gratz!
,JuggernautOfWar,2012-08-24T12:36Z,I thought this comes out a month from now. Was this leaked? 8/24/2012 is current date.
[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-24T13:13Z,"Yes, this is a stand-alone version. 

Jagged Alliance Vanilla is NOT needed."
,beermotoraxe,2012-08-25T15:56Z,"I hope the game was stolen.

The game works almost perfectly, however. There is a graphical glitch where window and door frames might appear in either red, green or blue hue. Other than that, not even a single crash. Got stable framerate, although GPU fan gets bit noisy (GTX 460). Maps are significantly larger now. Camera is awful and constricting. You still have to arm militia one by one. Same ugly character portraits, same dumbass AI, same boring and disenchanting character development system that was in JA:BIA. And same weapons. I've yet to see a new weapon in the game that I did not see in JA:BIA, except the M79. Same ugly substandard combat mechanics, in which the gun with highest RPM has the advantage in terms of stunlocking an opponent, because the game's logic is that the gun with highest RPM rating gets most single shots squeezed off over time. Difficulty seems to ramp up rather quickly, by which I mean enemy toughness goes up kinda fast, although I can't say I've played this with much effort and enthusiasm, feeling how uninteresting BiA and Crossfire both are.

If you liked JA:BIA, you'll like Crossfire.
If you hated JA:BIA, don't expect to like Crossfire.

Crossfire is just JA:BIA with a new world map and with latest JA:BIA features introduced by its later patches."
,jos3_riv3ra,2012-08-26T04:01Z,works! crossfire's just like BIA! Jagged Alliance fanatics will surely like this game! I only got 30-40kbps so I'll seed for a week or two! Thanks @tikasukaz and to skidrow great job!
,Levy_NR,2012-08-26T21:04Z,"oh, some error occurs after intro clips. Any advices how to solve it?"
,Xigor,2012-08-29T07:57Z,HEY! this is cool and all but release the patch for back in action. 1.13E
