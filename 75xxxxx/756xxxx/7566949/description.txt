Official description (from http://www.liberation.com.au):

Fatboy Slim hardly needs an introduction. The man, who is known officially as Norman Cook, has been at the forefront of the music industry for the past twenty-five years, pioneering dance music and pushing the boundaries of electronic music. 

Dance Harder Bitch is the follow-up to 2009's highly successful Dance Bitch. The album is a DJ mix CD featuring twenty of dance music's hottest artists, mixed together and stamped with Fatboy Slim's signature sound. Think the intensity of Fatboy Slim's live set coupled with the sleekness of his studio production rolled into one hot, sweaty package. The album features artists such as Plump DJs, Armand Van Helden, Steve Aoki & Sidney Samson, Crookers, Riva Starr, Fedde Le Grand, Steve Angello and even the man himself, Fatboy Slim.

Over the past three decades, Fatboy Slim has performed to literally millions of people all over the world and has sold almost a million albums in Australia alone. He's released five studio albums, three live albums and four DJ mix CDs. Dance Harder Bitch epitomises Fatboy Slim's sound and only further cements his powerhouse status in the world of electronic music.
