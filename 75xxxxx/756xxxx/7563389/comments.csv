As such I believe that an ""It works"" is in order, at least until someone finds a horrible bug like, IIRC, the one in Dead Space 2 from Fairlight's earlier crack that prevented game progression."

,fishboy11,2012-08-24T16:33Z,why the heck does this game need a crack?? it has no copy protection. you just need to use an offline account to save.
