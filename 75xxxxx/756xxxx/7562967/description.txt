New Zealand trio Left or Right assault the ears with a mighty blend of raw rock & sonic jazz. Utilising nifty shifts in tempo and approach, compositions can change from Black Sabbath-type riffs to brass-infused funk in a moment, as revealed from the get go on Hitchy. On Park Street, the mix is even more imaginative as blends of 70s wah-wah guitar with soaring lead breaks highlighting the percussive and solid rhythmic structure. Following the upbeat and reggae-styled Sugar, Left or Right focus on its tight harmonies on Right for Me. At times one could feel they have stepped into the field of a 70s music festival and be inspired to stay a while in the sounds of Left or Right. Members Callum Hampton, Metua Marama and Stephen Marshall have got their sound heading in a number of directions. Culminating in the final track Sleep, Left or Right would be a killer band to see live
