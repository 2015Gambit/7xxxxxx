Game Description:

MagnaCarta 2 is a role-playing that mixes real-time elements during exploration with turn-based combat. The game stars Juto as the main character. He seems to be a normal guy but suffered from amnesia and is hiding a secret power deep within him. After the Northern Forces swoop down a highwind island where he lives, his friend Melissa and islanders are killed. Juto sets out to take a revenge and joins up with the Southern Forces' Counter Sentinel Unit to find the man who is responsible for Melissa's death.

Defeating monsters is rewarded with Kamonds. These are used to power up weapons and create new items when a new recipe has been bought or discovered.
