Note: Right, quality is pretty much the same as the v1, it is better though and
there isn't as much movement in this video than the last one, which means the
heroes faces aren't cropped off at times. Took the source, filtered it, tweaked
it, worked on the colours trying to get them looking a little richer, before then
dropping the file size and here we go. Sample included. Enjoy!
