,nycmon,2012-08-28T04:33Z,other source is better quality...but at least this source isn't all cropped the hell off and missing parts ....some dumbass blocks the movie for like 10-15 secs though....both sources have their shitty issues but if you don't care about the cropping then grab the other one...i'd recommend Inspiral version if you care more about the video clarity/quality thank the nasty cropping...

Don't bother...."
,Pdid,2012-08-31T20:25Z,"The most cliche crap? You are aware this movie is a homage to cheesy, cliche ridden 80's and 90's action films? So I do believe it is supposed to be filled with cliche you retard. Your complaint is tantamount to complaining of vampires being present in a Twilight movie. It is what it is."
