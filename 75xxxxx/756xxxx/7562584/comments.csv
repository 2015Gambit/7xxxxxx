,gaiden79,2012-08-28T02:16Z,Does anybody know if this back up is intended to be played on a modded Wii or Dolphin emulator?
,Manaphy2007,2012-08-29T07:24Z,"gaiden79 this can be played on any modded wii, preferably on a soft modded, use wii backup manager to transfer to your hdd (the format has to be wbfs, and you need the homebrew channel, usbloader gx (to play from a usb device) and certain ios installed. cant explain everything so google is your friend. as for working on Dolphin, if you exceed the requirement and your pc is really fast enough then yes, might be the as wii softmod but might be slow since the emulator int perfect."
