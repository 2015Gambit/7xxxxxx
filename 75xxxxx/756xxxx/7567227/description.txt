Nightmare House 2 is a free, horror-themed first-person-shooter game, and the direct successor of the first classic horror map pack "Nightmare House". Nightmare House 2 is based on the Source Engine by Valve, also considered a modification (mod) made for Half Life: Episode 2 and yeah this is FULL game with HL2EP2! :)

The story resumes with the player lost and confused in a hospital known as "Never Lose Hope".
