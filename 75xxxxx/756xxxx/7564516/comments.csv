,hack_sparrow,2012-08-27T12:06Z," hey  stiff , just wanted to ask  you  if this is playable  online , and  basically   if it has al lthe features of    the normal game . ?   thanks"
,urretado,2012-08-27T15:59Z,"@hack_sparrow
Since it uses GFWL, you can't play online, as with any other games we get here using GFWL

Knowing BlackBox repacks, you can expect full content, only slightly lower resolution movies"
