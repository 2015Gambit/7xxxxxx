Description:

Bauhaus Mirage - a powerful package for creating 2D-animation and special effects, which greatly reduces the complexity of the development of 2D-animated content. The product provides a means of combining drawing tools, working with color, animation, video, and special effects in one convenient development environment. Mirage is a unified environment for creating different types of animation. All that the animator creates a conventional studio - from storyboard to final scene of the project - can be done in an environment Mirage based on digital technology.

I'd add that programa based on raster graphics (as opposed to Flash or Toon Noir, who work with vector graphics), and therefore to create long movies use very ICDO resources. Frekventsii so all must be pre-planned and well thought out.

Nice work colleagues!
