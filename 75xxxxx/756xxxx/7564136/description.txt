Dejan's Olympia Brass Band~Best of New Orleans Jazz (Mardi Grass Records) [FLAC] {MKOP}

''The Olympia Brass Band provides a contemporary, yet authentic-sounding slant on traditional New Orleans classics, covering stomps, blues, spirituals, and novelty tunes with reverence and precision.''~Ron Wynn (Allmusic)

If you want to get a true understanding of New Orleans street bands, this is the place to start. This is New Orleans Brass Band music in rare form. Informal. A bit ragged (NOT a bad thing) at times. Great ensemble improv. It's live and honest on the street level. It's what you would hear if you were in the ''Second Line'' in a procession. I love this CD. ''Hey man, there goes Harold Dejean!'' And the (now deceased) Duke Dejean says, ''I want to leave you wit dis, 'everything is lovely.' '' This whole CD "is lovely." We miss you, Duke!~Alan B. Borne

This group is fantastic, lots of energy and great grooves. At times the musicianship is a bit off, but the infectious beat and syncopation make it a joy to behold. My only real complaint about the CD is that it's only 39 minutes long. Even in the days of LP records this would be bit of a skimpy collection...4 more songs and I'd give it 5 stars.~Ken Miller
