[V],psspss,2012-08-25T09:43Z,"I cant post a link to the info.. stupid TPB wont allow it LOL

but heres some blurb about the show---


Is the universe literally teeming with life? Are some UFO abductees being implanted with control chips? Is it possible that Bigfoot could be an alien entity? Are precognitive dreams a reality? Could paranormal forces be pushing cars up enigmatic gravity hills? Was the mighty T.Rex covered with feathers? What is causing an Aussie lake to glow brilliant blue? Who has been stealing female cadavers from Russian cemeteries?

These are among the intriguing subjects that I plan to probe on my new TV program,Professor Weird, which will be debuting on the Science Channel on Saturday, August 18 at 9 p.m. with repeats at midnight and Monday at 4 a.m."
