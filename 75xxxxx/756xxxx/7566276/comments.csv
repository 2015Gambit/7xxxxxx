but i never played part 1 of the game , is that gonna affect me in storywise? or are they related?"
,Cerebral222,2012-08-25T17:48Z,"@ancient78, I've never played the first one either & I've had no problems playing this; the only thing with this game is that some of the puzzles are tricky, that's why I included a walkthrough, you have no need to know anything about the first one to get through this one though."
,ancient78,2012-08-25T18:06Z,"thanks for the quick reply :)
