Inside the White House Situation Room, the newly elected Barack Obama immerses himself in the details of a remark┬¡able new American capability to launch cyberwar against IranΓÇöand escalates covert operations to delay the day when the mullahs could obtain a nuclear weapon. Over the next three years Obama accelerates drone attacks as an alter┬¡native to putting troops on the ground in Pakistan, and becomes increasingly reliant on the Special Forces, whose hunting of al-Qaeda illuminates the path out of an unwin┬¡nable war in Afghanistan.

 One of the most trusted and acclaimed national security correspondents in the country, David Sanger of the New York Times takes readers deep inside the Obama adminis┬¡trationΓÇÖs most perilous decisions: The president dispatch┬¡es an emergency search team to the Gulf when the White House briefly fears the Taliban may have obtained the Bomb, but he rejects a plan in late 2011 to send in Special Forces to recover a stealth drone that went down in Iran. Obama overrules his advisers and takes the riskiest path in killing Osama bin Laden, and ignores their advice when he helps oust Hosni Mubarak from the presidency of Egypt.

President Obama Middle Oriental stance is very problematic for the future of Israel, even so at all has been done on will Go program of nuclear arms, which am quite serious considering the Iranian the President has promised his people to "blow Israel of the map" when those are nothing least that speech of hate laced with a call in action. Worse, will Go constantly is moving inside to kill it with #his terrorist proxies to "wreck havoc" and finally destroy Israel; this is his aim, who can debate this?

It becomes even more dangerous because President Obama worries more on which the average is train to say in the people, because it knows that the masses adopt the one who is in the news like his opinion and belief, and governs only because of his popularity and skills of PR. Nevertheless, One has to note that Hamas is train to plan and has a strategy to take on the West Bank.

So much, with will Go funding both Hezbollah in a side and Hamas in the another, one has to ask the one who comes next, after all a lot the arms that these terrorist organizations are train to use has caused in will Go, and is obvious that will Go is train to use his money, arms and proxies to see his that Israel ceases to exist. It is for this that one has to ask, why Obama is not taking action and by not doing anything is inadvertently that causes the future of the big Israel peril? He thinks in this. 


The surprise is his aggressiveness,a key ambassador who works closely with Obama reports.

 Yet the president has also pivoted American foreign policy away from the attritional wars of the past decade, attempting to preserve AmericaΓÇÖs influence with a lighter, defter touch∩┐╜ all while focusing on a new era of diplomacy in Asia and reconfiguring Americas role during a time of economic turmoil and austerity.

 As the world seeks to understand whether there is an Obama Doctrine, Confront and Conceal is a fascinating, unflinching accounts....................
