Issues 1-6 of Steve Gerber's 'Nevada'
Vertigo/DC Comics, 1998

Nevada is the title of an American comic book limited series published by DC Comics under its Vertigo imprint in 1998. The series was written by Steve Gerber and with art from Phil Winslade, Steve Leialoha, and Dick Giordano.

The origin of the character is to be found in a Howard the Duck story that contained a "mandatory fight scene" between a Las Vegas chorus girl, an ostrich and a standing lamp. Writing on the CompuServe comics forum, Neil Gaiman said he'd like to see that story. So when Gerber was asked to come up with something original by Vertigo editor Karen Berger (who rejected his Vertigo take on Inferior Five, he created Nevada.

Nevada is a Las Vegas chorus girl with a pet performing ostrich named "Bolero". One day, reality begins to change; while investigating, she finds herself fighting against a mobster with a lava lamp for a head.

Sadly, even though Nevada II was promised at the end of the first mini-series, the only other place this creator owned character has ever appeared is in Vertigo's Winter's Edge Vol 1 & Vol 2, available here...
