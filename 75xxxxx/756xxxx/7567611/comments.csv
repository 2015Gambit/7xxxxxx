I need some more of your help.
I downloaded you wave from you:
(http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7504515/YouWave_for_Android_By_bobiras2009)
but the patch did refuse to download 
(threat: win 32 malware.....)
I want to run the apps on my PC but I need you wave for this.
Any ideas????

Thanks"

The patch is 100% clean.For 10 minutes close your antivirus download thhis program and the patch.Install it patch it and then open your antivirus again.It must work fine."

I will try it again while turning off the antivirus."
,wyattspoppa,2012-08-26T18:24Z,"This was awesome thanks. My son adored the interactive page swiping and push-screen to identify items. Have you other kids books like this with interactive artwork?
If you have a child from 3+. they will watch it over and over, terrific reading tool as well for the 5-7 yrs.
Thank you"

I am dying.
I tried everything.
I downloaded it without antivirus.
I got it.
I installed (copy and paste) the patch and I tried to run it as an administrator, but I only get some crazy music and I canÂ´t apply the patch.
What can I do?
I want to run you wave on the PC
Can you help me?
Thanks bobi"
