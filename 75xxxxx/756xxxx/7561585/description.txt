Creepy little tale, set in Trieste, about a woman suddenly suspended between two worlds separated by a highway tunnel. Has overtones of Carnival of Souls and Between Two Worlds, but Trieste is a lot nicer to look at. And how often do you get to see Trieste anyway?

A lot of viewers drool over Sting,but this is really Kathleen Turner's show - she does great. One of the first movies shot in hi-def video, which yiels an appropriate fuzzy look.
