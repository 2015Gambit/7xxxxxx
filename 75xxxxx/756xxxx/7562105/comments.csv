It is the same ebook. Sorry man my bad. A user from superbay requested it and I thought It wasn't uploaded yet. If you want I can stop seeding it and request to be deleted."

You don't have to be sorry for anything nor do you have to delete your torrent or stop seeding

Don't pay attention to ""dynstab2"" he has issues,he thinks he owns the copy rights to books and his torrents and has nothing else better to do other than spam ones torrents

Keep doing what your doing and ignore him"
