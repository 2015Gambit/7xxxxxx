This pack is the result of a request by another user, who pointed out that the HD versions hadn't been posted on the site.  So I figured it would be good to post all issues to date, with ALL variant covers.  
Both 1440px and 2048px-HD versions are included, as well as all the multiple printing variant covers from ScanDog

This landmark pop-culture event brings together Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Magneto and more in the story that changes them forever! And in AVX: Vs., experience the larger-than-life battles too big for any other comic to contain! Iron Man vs. Magneto! Spider-Man vs. Colossus! Captain America vs. Gambit! And more! It's Marvel's biggest event ever - but will the Avengers or the X-Men emerge triumphant?


Thanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for these scans, as well as ScanDog for ALL of the variant covers.
