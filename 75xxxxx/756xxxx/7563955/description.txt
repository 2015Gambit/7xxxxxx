Review
~~~~~~

by Stef

The first one is Amalgam's "Prayer For Peace", recorded in 1969, and it might
well be the re-issue of the year. The band is Trevor Watts on alto, Jeff Clyne
on bass and John Stevens on drums, with Barry Guy playing bass on the title
track.

"Tales Of Sadness" starts with arco bass and a wonderful melody on the alto,
slowly, very slowly increasing the intensity till they're playing up a storm
after a while,with especially Watts doing an extraordinary expressive piece
while staying within the tune, overblowing like crazy, till absolute madness,
relentlessly, without losing sight of the melody which suddenly comes shining
back through the mayhem like a sudden smile breaking through the tears on a
face full of agony and fear. This track is nothing short of phenomenal, and by
itself worth buying the album for.

The second piece, "Judy's Smile 1", is less intense, yet equally beautiful, and
it is continued on the second side of the vinyl LP with "Judy's Smile 2", which
starts slowly with great bass-playing by Clyne, and perfect accents by Stevens
for a quiet almost gospel-like melody on the alto. Then Stevens starts pushing
up the tempo, and the piece gains again a strong momentum, going beyond bop in
a more free fashion.

Also the last piece, with Barry Guy on arco, lifts the music into high spheres,
fully delivering the title's content, without any need for further explanation,
reverent, expansive, spiritual and full of inherent beauty and emotional
depth. Magnificent!
