I made this out of necessity. This is for those who stream to their TV or in a media center. They normally won't pick up the subs because of the separate SRT file. This is Mandarin Chinese with hardcoded English subs. If this is not something you're interested in, I'm sorry, but I made it for a small niche of people.
