thanks alot ..."
,jgaryk,2012-08-26T14:25Z,Thanks! Kind of you to post the series once more.
,neeliesu,2012-08-27T07:41Z,"@Pezacam - It plays fine on my computer through Windows Media Player, however as it's an MP4 file I used 'Freemake Video Converter' * to convert it to an AVI file,and put it on a disc or a memory stick so that we could watch it on a DivX player. Verovenlo is a very respected uploader, and shouting FAKE! like that isn't good. Better if you ask others if they have a problem, or d/l from someone else. *FVC is really easy to use and there are Tutorials on YouTube which are super easy to follow.                   "
