I call bullshit. You are posting fakes or malware. Die in a fire."

Your history of leaving files at 99% and making a new one to effectively double the amount people must download is also in question.

You are a scammer of some sort. Plain and simple. In this case, you probably work for MS and collect massive lists of IP addresses to report for piracy."
