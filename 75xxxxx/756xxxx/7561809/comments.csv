,ufodave1947,2012-08-24T03:46Z,The crack is no good. It gets stuck at the Loading screen.
,mags1987,2012-08-24T05:32Z,I unmounted the .rar file and made a few different .ISO files but cannot install the game. What files do i need to put in the .ISO file?
,taposh_xp,2012-08-24T07:13Z,"Okey Guys listing up : I found it........
//////// This game have date issue. Only 8/23/2012 Run this game. any  fix crack????? \\\\"
,ufodave1947,2012-08-24T08:14Z,"Correction, the crack works fine, but you have to have Steam installed or it won't load."
,nightfallsg,2012-08-24T11:59Z,Must Steam be running when I want to run the game with the crack ? Thanks.
[T],tikasukaz,2012-08-24T13:14Z,"its working perfectly, just install steam, install the game, copy the cracks, just as simple as usual."
,psylotic1,2012-08-24T13:21Z,Buddha.dll is a Trojan
,hulkman185,2012-08-24T14:19Z,"I have steam installed, i installed the game, put the crack into the folder where it says binaries, and when i go to start the game it says damaged saved game, unavailable to load saved game. I have done everything i can think of to get it to work. What am i doing wrong that you didn't?. It goes to the menu but it won't let me click on anything. "
,bionic30,2012-08-24T19:26Z,it doesnt work norton keeps blocking it
,arby80,2012-08-25T01:56Z,"hulkman185 If it says your save file is corrupt rename the file username/documents/mygames/transformers

It worked for me.  I think the War of Cybertron saved file is named the same as this game."
,arby80,2012-08-25T02:12Z,Rename the file username/documents/my games/transformers if it is not loading your save file.
,Scottyp_123,2012-08-25T07:13Z,"I am also getting a ""campaign saved game is damaged and unavailable"" error on start up. 

I can't rename the file username/documents/my games/transformers because the folder is empty. 

There is a folder for ""War for Cybertron"" (it's called ""TransGame"") but I don't think the saves would be compatible.
"
,Scottyp_123,2012-08-25T07:20Z,"OK 

Got a fix to work:

rename the folder username/documents/my games/transformers/TransGame/SaveData to something else (i used SaveData old) then make a new empty folder named SaveData in its place.

The game is getting confused when it tries to open the war for cybertron saved games. Just give it an empty folder and it will let you play."
,Lerianis2,2012-08-25T08:11Z,"Anyone else getting a 0xc0000142 error when trying to start the game on Windows 8 x64 Consumer Preview?

If so and you have managed to correct this error, how was that done?"
,G1247,2012-08-25T18:32Z,"Has anyone been able to get on Multiplayer and Escalation ? when i attempt to it tells me could not create account [Invalid Keycode] while trying to join the mutiplayer and escalation online part of the game.
Has anyone found out how to get into those online sections of the game because id like to try the online portion of the game as well ..need help plz "
,JonhBR,2012-08-25T21:47Z,"buddha.dll ERRO !
WHY ?"
,Daredevil_88,2012-08-26T02:25Z,"My anti virus is finding virus content in every crack variations far in the budhha.dll file...  False positives my ass, that file is a virus."
,hulkman185,2012-08-26T12:05Z,"thank you arby80, i got it to work. I was wondering if that steam unlock version works with this crack as good as it did for the skidrow iso. I wouldn't mind playing online and if that steam unlocked version means that it will allow you to play online, or is there a trick i have to do to get to work. "
,hulkman185,2012-08-26T12:06Z,Or if i just have to buy this game. If i do i will definetly buy it. 
,rj1995,2012-08-27T14:03Z,"Doesn't work ufodave1947 is right!!!

Gets stuck at loading screen!!!!"
,marshyman69,2012-09-01T07:12Z,"this works great, idk what they is all talking about, get steam ppl.  btw, i got an account on here just so i could write this comment: SKIDROW I LOVE YOU!  that and this:  this game means the world to me, and i freakin love it.  however, the game would be 10 times better if you can go online, please find a way to make this happen and launch me an email :D marshyman@Live.ca"
