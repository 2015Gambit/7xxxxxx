,kentcave,2012-08-24T05:27Z,"""DUE TO TPB CANNOT ACCEPT .URL files CONTAINED IN TORRENT - IN MOVIES SECTION, SO I HAVE UPLOADED THIS UNDER OTHERS-OTHERS.""

Simple..then just DONT include those advert/promo url anymore.
As if those annoying pop-up inside the movie alone (blocking the pics and subs) aint infuriating enough.
Sigh.."

,kentcave,2012-08-24T13:01Z,"Then dont put those url files in your folder.
Just upload the movie, clean avi/rmvb/mkv/mp4 etc files only.

Those url files has nothing to do with the movies (other than promo/gratitude), really.
Yes, once you upload the folder WITH those url files included, then the story will be different.

The mods had gave plenty of warnings, many times. Harsh actually, if they have not yet bother to ask and understand in the first place.

We care..hence we try. Nothing changes anyway, keep it coming.
All we need to do is just to tick off downloading the extras or just delete those once done.

Psst..I can vouch for others that those aint malicious link to irresponsible sites.
But, then again what others' consider annoying sites might not be similiar to my taste.
(See why they are scared of those ""extra"" files included?)

Once you get your color, they wont doubt anymore. But this will just slow the process of getting it anyway. See?"

,kentcave,2012-08-25T06:18Z,Thanks for letting me realized there are still others out there using the ole ways. But personally I still consider those as outdated from laziness.
[T],xxbel,2012-08-25T13:54Z,"i think you misunderstood. i did not make these torrents myself it is from sharing from a chinese forum. so if i change the torrent files by taking out the .url from it, it will change the hash infor thus you wont be able to seed with the others in the forum or anyone who used the original torrent"
,kentcave,2012-08-27T04:03Z,Thank Thee Ser!
