'Dracula - Book 1'
Warren Publishing, 1972, 126 page graphic novel


Awesomely weird graphic novel from Warren Publishing!

First of all, the coloring was clearly done by somebody who hadn't stopped doing acid yet. Psychedelic doesn't come close to describing it. And while some of the art is in a straight ahead comic book style, a lot of it ventures into the realm of the underground comic book world, as well. Surreal, impressionistic and just all around great fun to look at (the Agar Agar stories in particular).

Second, it's not just about Dracula, or even just vampires! Even weirder, the stories throughout the book alternate every few pages. So you constantly changing stories that fall under the main titles of Wolff (a barbarian), Sir Leo (Victorian gentleman), Agar Agar (psychedelic future alien magic woman), Fear Sweet Fear (straight ahead horror, but with really disturbing impressionist style art) and a Weird World (pretty straight horror - even uses traditional characters - with pretty straight art, other than the coloring). 

Last, and strangest of all, I can't find artist or writer credits! At least not behind Enric Sio's signature being on EACH PAGE of Fear, Sweet, Fear.

It's just an awesomely weird book.
