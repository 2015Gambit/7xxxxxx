Also - thanks belatedly for including the Rend Collective Experiment album ""Homemade Worship By Handmade People"" in your first bundle of the year - do you also happen to have the first album, ""Organic Family Hymnal""? I'd love to hear their earlier stuff too.

Thanks again for your spectacular work!"
