'Dracula - A Symphony in Moonlight and Nightmares'

The Marvel Comics Group, 1986, 82 pages

Words and Pictures by Jon J Muth

This is a painted novel, something along the lines of Neil Gaiman's and Charles Vess' 'Stardust'. It contains beautiful watercolor paintings by Muth with typeset words that interfere with the art as little as possible.
