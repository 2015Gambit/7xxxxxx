I have issues 1-20 inclusive in true pdf, so if you could post 21 through 33, it would be great. For those wondering why I am requesting this when I already have the bitmap editions from Spetses, it makes it possible to do searches across all the issues in years to come. Quite useful, really."
,raymond_u,2012-08-23T21:40Z,"@thorhammer - that is due to a massively sh*tty internet connection. Lols. Look, do you have any way I can contact you privately? Email or whatever? I can pass on to you the knowledge of how to get these editions.

Given you once were the supplier of these - I know I can trust you to reliably spread the love to others. I'll see what I can do about 21-33. Shouldn't be too hard, just tedious - so I'll upload in one go as one massive torrent file as opposed to 13. It'll take some time (coupled with my otherwise busy schedule) - so check back some time next week."
