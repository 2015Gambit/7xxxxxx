X-plore allows you to see inside of your Android phone or tablet.

This is a dual-pane explorer, which means that there're two folders shown at same time, and common operation such as copying files are done from one pane to another.
And X-plore shows folder hierarchy in a tree view. This offers clear orientation on where in file system you currently are, and fast switching to other location.

Currently selected folder and files are highlighed, while other folders/files have slighly darker background.

You may explore internals of the device, and if you're power user and have your device rooted, you can make changes to system data - backup files, remove unwanted applications, etc.

If you're standard user, you may choose to hide internal memory from view and be sure not to mess with system.
You can comfortably see contents of your external memories, either be it built-in high capacity memory, external memory card, or possibly USB memory stick attached to your tablet. All these memory types are listed in main level, you don't need to search for their folders on the device.

Access to FTP and FTPS (secure FTP) servers is supported.
Multiple servers may be configured. All standard file operations can be done on FTP server.

X-plore can display shared folders on other computers in LAN (local area network).
The system allows access to shared folders on computers connected to LAN, or even remote server if it supports SMB protocol.

X-plore can access various web storage "Cloud" servers, and access their files.
You need to have account in supported web service, then you can access your files stored online through X-plore.

Main operations are related to managing files and folders - viewing, copying, moving, deleting, compressing to Zip, extracting, renaming, sharing, and more.
