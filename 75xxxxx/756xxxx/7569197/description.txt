Due to government experiments, the beautiful girl Chase Darrow is addicted to finding true love. She is incredibly dynamic, with all sorts of men falling for her. The problem is, loving her means death. Her lovers literally age and die, though happy and blissful. Chase is traumatized by this but it is hard to fight her addiction.

Chase comes to the attention of the world's first actual super-human, called The Man. He is crass and self-absorbed, a polar opposite of Chase's core personality.
