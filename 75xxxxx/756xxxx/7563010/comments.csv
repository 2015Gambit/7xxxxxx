about the show: popular players like Frank always win when it comes to guessing numbers or finding a hidden  key in a huge box of plastic balls. They get information from endemol before the game starts or even during the game."
,Sknight82,2012-08-25T06:30Z,I doubt they're feeding Frank information on the games.

This time the game with finding stuff in a pool of plastic balls didn't look staged. It was not crucial for keeping a popular player in the house.
But i can remember  episodes where this game was staged: Jeff Schroeder in season 11 i think and Hayden Moss in season 12.

When it comes to guessing numbers the popular candidate receives the information just after the other candidates wrote their number down.
So the number still has a distance to the target number and it doesn't look fake, but it is close enough to win."
