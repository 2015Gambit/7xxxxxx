,laskar,2012-09-09T23:31Z,"Hey bobiras..I downloaded this version and it works fine with obb patch and old obb file. The problem is this version is supposed to fix pink outlines but I still have plenty of that (device is xperia S). So I guess I need the new sd file of v1.1.1. Will you upload that? I know you have very little time these days so if you don't have time, could you please provide me with a link where I could download the new 111 obb file from? Thanks in advance :)"
