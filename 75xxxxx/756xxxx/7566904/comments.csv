,cjhffm,2012-08-29T13:53Z,"This AI add on pack is excellent, thank you!

I have only a couple of comments/problems:

- after installing, the traffic for Lufthansa Cityline is missing. I also noticed there is no schedule.

- in the next update, maybe you could make the special livery aircraft (I.e. not the generic repaints) only show up about 10% or so of the time. At the moment, too many of the planes are special liveries. This is quite unrealistic.

Otherwise, you did a great job. Thanks!"

thank u for advice. I've added 'Lufthansa Regional' (Air Dolomiti, Augsburg Airways,Contact Air,Eurowings,Lufthansa CityLine).
I also try to change max usage of some special livery (airfrance, alitalia,british airways, iberia, klm, lufthansa, transavia).

,Romgun,2012-09-01T09:22Z,"Some guys report about errors after update (duplicated titles of aircrafts).
I think that the problem occurs because FSX was installed in the ""Program Files (x86)"". In a short time I will do a complete package and inform you!"
,Romgun,2012-09-01T09:43Z,"If after installation of update you have an error (duplicated names of aircraft) try this:

1) delete folder Microsoft Flight Simulator XSimObjectsUT2 Aircraft

2) reinstall ATP F1UT-2.exe
(choose the actual location of FSX!!)

2) move the folder “UT2 Aircraft” to  disk D (for example)

3) open FSX.CFG and  in the section [Main] replace:

SimObjectPaths.*** = SimObjects  UT2 Aircraft 
to
 SimObjectPaths.*** = D:UT2 Aircraft (for example)

4) install “ATP UPDATE-08-2012.exe”
(choose the actual location of FSX!!)

5) install “Voicepack Update-08-2012.exe” (optional)

6) install “Update-31_08_2012.exe”
(choose the actual location of FSX!!)

7) move  folder “UT2 Aircraft”  back to  and restore FSX.CFG."

,cjhffm,2012-09-02T14:06Z,"hi Romgun,

This is working well, thank you! I haven't got an errors. It seemed to install correctly. 

I noticed that you adjusted the frequency of special liveries!  That's perfect. 

Well done!!  So far this is the best AI addon available
