,HootieB,2012-08-26T15:17Z,"Thanks a lot for the full collection Moia420. Been real anxious to read the conclusion in Book 3.
As I suspected you seem to be aware of the occasional FREE novel accompaniment one can find at WOTC's D&D pages, specifically this link: http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Archive.aspx
However, as I take it you are something of a perfectionist like myself, you might want to include in your next FR update, James P. Davis's extended ending to Waterdeep Book 6 ""Circle of Skulls"" which is called ""Speak of the Devil"". Very interesting, but one MUST read the original first."
