,xpmule,2012-08-27T01:01Z,"so far this is what i see..

there is a ""crack"" (revemu+revloader) posted on csmania (works only if you have a client.dll generated for your HW).
Works with newest 1.17.5.1
(My 1.17.3 works fine too).
Game works fine with bots, online play isn't tested, but maybe doesn't work!
Game may starts slowly, you can see black screen a few seconds (or minute).

Which means you need to have someones account to delete and regenerate the client.dll for your machine or forget it you can't play lol

@ijam_j
one of the names i use online is "".cue""
and i was cracking valve games like 8 fuckin years ago and i know ALL the people involved and can get a hold of them easily in a heart beat. So uhh yeah i do know what the fuck I'm talking about and i bet a many people have played many of the games some of my old pc game cracking groups have released lol

Funny how people assume so much with out knowing who the fuck they are talking to.."
,xpmule,2012-08-27T01:04Z,"and if I got a straight answer as to what the fuck this is maybe i would download it and help crack the fucker..

but seeing all the mouthy assholes i kinda don't wanna bother.. hence why i retired from the pc game cracking scene in the first place !"
,thef10man,2012-08-27T04:59Z,"Wow xpfaggot. Your posts are like fucking garbage. You ""cracked"" the Razor1911 post of GTAIV to remove the logo? WOW! SO HARD! GET ON THIS MAN'S LEVEL GUYS! HE'S COMPSCI3!"
,stone2549,2012-08-27T06:06Z,"how to play?

,q2323,2012-08-27T19:05Z,"xpmule you are high as fuck, stupid, and annoying. you can't crack a peanut. and thats why u retired from peanut cracking scene."
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-08-28T23:02Z,"@Bogdanuttzz07

Watch your mouth asshole, SKIDROW, RELOADED, FLT and every other group out there are doing this for free, it's not like you're paying them or something, if they didn't exist you'd have to pay 50$ for every game you downloaded from this torrent site, fucking arrogant kid."
,Bogdanuttzz07,2012-08-31T11:53Z,"AdrenaLiNv2
