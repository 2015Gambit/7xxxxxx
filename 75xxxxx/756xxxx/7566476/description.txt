Young Dracula is a sophisticated tale of young Vlad Dracul, the historical Christian Knight. From the crusades to his meeting with Jonathon Harker which inspired the Dracula novel to a journey into the future, the saga of Young Dracula is an intricate horror tale balanced by the haunting innocence of a ghostly fairy tale.
