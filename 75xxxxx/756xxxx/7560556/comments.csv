,GoodGravy,2012-08-23T14:57Z,"@BreakTTB, Can you give us a snapshot of the game on your hard drive? ie:

,MasterFasterVDOWN,2012-08-23T16:36Z,"Look for these releases:

3DMGAME-Dark.SoulsPrepare.or.Die.Edition-3DM
Dark.Souls.Prepare.To.Die.Edition.Retail-ALI213
3DMGAME-Dark.Souls.Crack.Only.V2-3DM

But I don't know if they include english language or chinese only, or if the crack works ok."
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2012-08-23T16:43Z,"I forgot the crack by ALI213

DarkSouls.Crack.Only-ALI213

For download links go to their official sites. I'm not posting any links anymore."
,Darkilla,2012-08-23T18:33Z,i hope they patch this game... the mouse pointer is always viewed and if you play with the keyboard only its really annoying to turn the camera wanted to play it so badly...
,moosies,2012-08-23T19:20Z,No crack - GFWL looks for release date on network. Wait until it's cracked properly I guess.
,Rovelius,2012-08-23T19:27Z,"@Darkilla They're not gonna patch it, they said many times K/B support would be minimal. Grab a PC controller instead."

,BreakTTB,2012-08-23T20:22Z,julesfloep@yes.!
,radas4402,2012-08-23T20:44Z,Hi can someone tell me link to crack.
,radas4402,2012-08-23T20:47Z,Anyone got link to crack plz :)
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2012-08-23T21:13Z,Both ALI213 and 3DMGAME cracks work for offline mode but you cannot save your progress. That's what I read.
,NakanoSan,2012-08-23T21:28Z,"If you have a legit game that uses G4WL, log in there first are make sure auto-login and remember pass is checked. After that just launch Dark Souls and it'll log you in on offline mode. This is how I run my cracked G4WL games (though some like Gears of War won't save achievements).

If you don't have access to that I'm not sure what to do. You can try downloading the Games for Windows Marketplace client, download Age of Empires Online, and log in through there."
,GObonzo,2012-08-23T21:29Z,if you an't play a game with a mouse than you shouldn't be playing it on PC or MAC
,radas4402,2012-08-23T21:48Z,when i instal it seys KEY: 11111-11111-11111-1111  that is wrong for me
,JulesFloep,2012-08-23T22:00Z,"I am not going to risk this.
The installer looked a bit suspicious to me. 
I'll wait for a proper download."
,radas4402,2012-08-23T22:17Z,anyone havee problems with xlive.dll 5377

,Kalik20,2012-08-23T23:08Z,Prepare to die bitches!
,Hajeil,2012-08-24T01:46Z,I wouldn't bother with this. If it's not showing up on Releaselog then this is not an official Scene release. I'd wait for one from a trusted uploader or try to find the uncracked Multi9 version. 
,arto1234,2012-08-24T02:36Z,Terrible game guys. Do not waste your time.
,dehrehk,2012-08-24T03:07Z,"Couldn't get past the skeletons, arto?"
,Chaoz6,2012-08-24T03:45Z,Works but the port is awful can't even find the button to open menu... 
,fishboy11,2012-08-24T04:25Z,"there wont be a scene release for this, there s no copy protection, just install and use an offline account, you need a key to play online of course but offline you can play without, also dont use a crack with a crack gfwl wont launch and you cant save"
,MoryCory,2012-08-24T05:13Z,"I select where I want to install the game and the Product Key screen comes up. I've tried entering every one I've been told to enter, and none of them work. What's the deal?"
,Hancock79,2012-08-24T05:49Z,"@GObonzo ""if you an't play a game with a mouse than you shouldn't be playing it on PC or MAC""

what's that supposed to mean?  plenty of us have gamepads and we have enough games where a gamepad excels to warrant buying one.  just like M+KB is better with other games."
,Hancock79,2012-08-24T07:11Z,"i don't know what everyone's talking about not being able to save.  you just make an offline profile with G4WL just like many other games and you can save and load like usual.  on top of that I didn't even need to crack this or use a serial.  G4WL did the online thing, no errors and it runs fine afterwards."
,Zephrith,2012-08-24T07:40Z,"LOL 666 seeders, prepare to die!"
,superatomic,2012-08-24T08:19Z,"@fishboy11 
You can't ""just install and use an offline account""..it needs a product key you idiot."
,cmoyano,2012-08-24T09:04Z,"@superatomic 
yo idiot, yes you can.  click create new profile, after scroll down ull see local profile link, create one and your set.  i can save now and play the game perfectly without a crack.  also, if you have a previously owned game on gfwl it will read your profile go offline and you can get offline achievements for your gamertag"
,sadness25,2012-08-24T11:28Z,"i confirm what cmoyano say you can play offline with this
play this game with a keyboard is just IMPOSSIBLE too much shitty key ans well ... this game is really fun because of the online and with the cracked version you obviously can't"
,JOKERfl,2012-08-24T14:34Z,i was really looking forward to this releasing on PC until i found out fps is capped at 30 and has no enhanced graphics. i wouldn't pay for it but i will torrent it to see how bad it is so i can warn others.
,gacek2204,2012-08-24T15:27Z,where is cd-key?! this isnt funny 
,BreakTTB,2012-08-24T16:06Z,I just upload the crack guys.!
,coolzed,2012-08-24T18:22Z,"Doesn't work the CD key isn't active at all, 
11111-11111-11111-1111.
"
,felix0585,2012-08-24T21:32Z,Not real serial 11111 11111 11111 11111 is crap i got the game but dosent work....DONT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING.
,Loki021,2012-08-25T00:03Z,CD key dor G4WL NOW
,Leonardo7th,2012-08-25T04:35Z,"@felix0585 You might notice when it's asking for the serial in the setup, there are 5 groups of X's in the example, while the 1's have only 4 groups so.. add another one, 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111 works, was probably a typo."
,area051,2012-08-26T10:59Z,"The Cover Look Nice but the game sucks end the video Quality es Very Very Bad  don't recommend that you download it,, its not worth the time..

my Game Rating: out of 5 give it     1. for been there for download, lol :D"
,FIBu,2012-08-26T11:39Z,"everything beautifully nicely, he is playing and is wailing:)"
,Dazzor,2012-08-27T11:19Z,"Downloaded it over night, installed, applied CD-Key Make sure you have 5 groups of 1's not 4.
Then I made an offline account for windows live and works beautifully, I am able to save and the port is not bad its actually pretty good."
,simonk666,2012-08-29T08:23Z,"wtf is everyone so dumb? this game works fine for me. Im using a kb and mouse also and loving it 
just run the installer, press X a million times for cd key, let GFWL very the game then make an offline account when the game loads.... ur welcome"
,nyantiger,2012-08-29T09:44Z,"Torrent is great, game is great however the port is just appalling, I found it unplayable hopefully some updates will fix this"
,dairou,2012-09-03T16:11Z,"This is a masterpiece of a game, bashed by many for being a horrible port. Yes it is bad, but using a 360 controller and Dsfix (many thanks to its creator) it is perfectly playable (40+ hours of play so far). You will experience the rare fps problems but much less than in the console version. If I had easy access to dollars I would definitely buy this game for the multiplayer. To install I used the 1111... serial and that was it. Follow instructions, use a controller and dsfix and you will have a great time with Dark Souls."
