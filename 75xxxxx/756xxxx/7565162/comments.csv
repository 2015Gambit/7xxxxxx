I have a lot of books on ""Emergency Care"" I just don't have the specific one your looking for.

Is there another you might be interested in ??? "
,danwinan,2012-08-24T23:19Z,I was looking for something at the paramedic level. This just what the local program uses. Anything comparable would be great. Anything related to trauma surgery would also be appreciated. Thank you for the medical and other files you have already posted; keep em coming.
