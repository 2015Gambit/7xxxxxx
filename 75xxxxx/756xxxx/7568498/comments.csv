,MissSweetItalianGurl,2012-08-28T07:21Z,If you knew it wasn't all real then why upload it? 
,dragan09,2012-08-28T15:36Z,"because 2 songs are legit.but when you so a intelligent brain,why do you not upload something"
,MissSweetItalianGurl,2012-08-29T22:26Z,"Because his whole new Dedication 4 album isn't out yet and I wouldn't upload something that isn't complete. A lot of you uploaders upload shit that isn't complete or real. Trust and believe that as soon as I get a hold of the COMPLETE and REAL Dedication 4 album, I will upload it! There's a intelligent brain for you!"

Don't trip on these clowns. They don't know how thorough you were on the Noid. How the fuck can someone complain and talk shit about free music. This cat has uploaded more music on the net than most of you even download or leach. All of his shit is nice. believe that."
