This includes the entire 6 issues miniseries, Fury v3 by Garth Ennis and Darrick Robertson.  This book was one of the original launch titles for Marvel's MAX line of adult-themed comic series.  Oft-criticized for its over-the-top violence and vulgarity, one thing is for sure, it never holds back.  Ennis has most recently taken the Fury MAX reigns once again with the current series.  So I find it interesting to read this older run and see his first take on the character.
These are ALL NEW SCANS (well, they were new about a year ago but as I said haven't been posted here).  Both c2c and noAds versions are provided.
========================================================


In the Marvel MAX-imprint miniseries Fury, by writer Garth Ennis and penciller Darick Robertson, Fury is a burned-out Cold War veteran unable to cope with the modern world. He is swiftly drawn into a conflict with an old HYDRA enemy and the new bureaucratic version of S.H.I.E.L.D. This version continues to appear in Ennis' Punisher series. Writer-editor Stan Lee, a co-creator of Nick Fury, was critical of the extreme violence and gore of this new series: "I don't know why they're doing that. I don't think that I would do those kinds of stories."
