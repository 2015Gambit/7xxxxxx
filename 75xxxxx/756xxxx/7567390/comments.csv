,loumos123,2012-08-25T14:25Z,are your files safe

My torrents are safe dont worry about that.I have instructions on how to install and included all the activators + a lot of keys for this version"

,Damien74,2012-08-28T18:25Z,"You rarely have to worry about antivirus apps having viruses. That would be detected first or second time you update the antivirus.
Also, if you download without previous antivirus you probably have windows own security still activated and even though it wont compare to a real antivirus it does work and its gettin more efficient.
Just update and scan the Kaspersky folders after all is done with installing it."

,nikola.bl,2012-09-05T16:39Z,this awesome thanks a lot man :D
,ineedanswers,2012-09-09T03:37Z,222 key would not work for internet security :(
,ineedanswers,2012-09-09T03:49Z,"Both kis serials also did not work as kis is still in 91 day trial mode
the keys in the keys folder were all for 2012 version or before..."
,ineedanswers,2012-09-09T04:10Z,"Sorry, I finally figured it out by reading some of the other upload for 2013's comments, the instructions were just wrong. instead of 2222 it has to be 22222
but I chose to do it offline so I used 11111 with an x instead of u at the last part.

Then when I was offline, I could then use the kis12 keys that were in the keys folder and got activated for 199 days remaining :)"
,RipperDaVe,2012-09-11T19:07Z,Your stuff usually top notch thanks for all the torrents - on this one I can't find a key for anitvirus - just internet stuff - am i missing something? Thanks
