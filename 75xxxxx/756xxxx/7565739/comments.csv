in case people don't know DVD rips like these from groups are released daily and 99% of them never make it on to P2P sites and eventualy the links get reported and the releases vanish from the net.

For example GHI dvdrips and Rock's Modern Life dvdrips are some that i got that were almost gone.. sad seeing dvdrips vanish and crappy tv rips stuck on p2p forever"
