Anyway, i have the platinium trophee on PS3, and i swear one thing, Playing without online feature at Dark Souls is useless."
,fishboy11,2012-08-24T06:22Z,maybe if they had of put some actual work into the port and not given us such a shit port i may have bought it
,fishboy11,2012-08-24T06:23Z,"the game is locked at 1024x720 rez, the keyboard controls are all but useless, the mouse pointer is always on the screen, it is locked at 30 fps, i could go on..."
,drnever,2012-08-24T06:34Z,"dude, I just want to see if the game runs on my PC worth a crap or should I just wait for the DLC on consoles.  

And I agree, playing Dark Souls offline is really not even close to the same experience.  "
,Jurriya,2012-08-24T06:35Z,Crack only ?
,Jurriya,2012-08-24T06:37Z,"A modder already fixed and unlocked the 1024 resolution , can go higher now ."

Politicians are fucked.
Gas is sky high, wages are rock bottom.
No jobs to be found.

From Software can't deliver a decent port?
Fuck 'Em. Fuck 'em directly in the face."
