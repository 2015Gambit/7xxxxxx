Description
Follow Gangster Granny on her way out of the prison. Help her defeat anyone who dares to try and stop her from robbing the biggest bank in the city!

"Someone once told me, that some time ago in some place far away, there was this old granny. For some reason she was known as Gangster Granny. This was not so much for her connection with mafia families, but for her terrible deeds. Bank robberies, stealing gold, buying the most powerful weapons and getting into conflicts with the law all described her personality perfectly. She was a gangster alright! Of that there was no doubt!

She was tempted out of retirement by an irresistible job. The chance to rob biggest bank in the city. Granny did her best, but unfortunately she got caught and was sent to prison for a very long time. You may think this was the end of it...

But one day she got a package delivered to her cell from a secret sender, and there was a gun in it... Looks like it's time for her to finish the job she once started!"

Now, even the most fearsome enemy is no match for Gangster Granny!
