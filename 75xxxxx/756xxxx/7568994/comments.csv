,steve30x,2012-08-26T00:06Z,This crackfix doesnt work
,OmniNegro,2012-08-26T00:20Z,"""suckerp"" on another torrent posted this. It works. Despite the numerous typos, it works fine. A little bird told me so...

ugh guys, u are so annoying.
OK LISTEN UP, download this torrent, install the game. and thats it, delete the torrent. after that, download and replace the patch 1.4 in the main directory (by 3DM) http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7550983/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_1.4_NEW_UPDATE_FIX-3DM_by_T.F.K
after that download and replace the crack in the main directory too (by 3dm too)
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7556674/Sleeping.Dogs.New.Crack.Freeze.Fixed-3DM
and ur done! WORKS TRUST ME, I DONT KNOW HOW U PEOPLE CANNOT GOOGLE THINGS OR JUST THINK WITH UR HEAD A LITTLE. the main thing is, dont use the crack from this torrent as it is bad. "
,OmniNegro,2012-08-26T00:21Z,Thank you scene4all nonetheless. :)
,Kneph,2012-08-26T03:20Z,"@OmniNegro...followed your instructions perfectly...still doesnt work. I just dont get this game...my comp specs are well beyond whats needed to run the game. Ive downloaded thyis game like 5x now..always freezes after I click ""new game"". Sad part is...even people that bought htis game are having the same problem, so don think people cant get it working because they cant read or google stuff...this game works for some and doesnt worrk for others...even Square doesnt know what they fuck is going on"
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-26T09:59Z,"OmniNegro: You beat me to it. I was just about to post this exact thing.
Game works perfectly. 1680x1050 Resolution, Nvidia GTS250, E5200 Dual Core at 3.0Ghz(OC), and some slow ass 4gig DDR2. 
Must really suck to be someone with thousands of dollars in a PC. You don't need that power. A game on High Settings will not be 100% better looking than on Medium. A game on Medium will not be 100% better looking than LOW. Native Resolution is important. THEN Graphics. Everytime a game comes out, so do all the morons. If you're too lazy to read, just pay for the game. Or Wait for a fix like everyone else. "
,steve30x,2012-08-26T10:07Z,"@OmniNegro : I said ""THIS"" crack fix doesnt work. I know that 3DM crack works but the dlc doesnt work with it. "
,SHADOWLEXX,2012-08-26T13:39Z,"@ChilliCross 
Only cuz it wont look better for you, on your pissy 17"" Display, doesnt mean it wont look better for people with 60""+ or Head Mounted Displays. SO shut up with ur lowspec/-resolution Crap and let the grown people play :D"
,OmniNegro,2012-08-26T13:46Z,"Speaking of morons... If you can afford to buy a 60"" display with high resolution or a headset display then you can afford to buy the fucking game and stop bitching that free shit is not good enough for you.

People who steal games usually want to buy them. They want to verify the game is not bullshit before they pay for it though.

And if you cannot play the game because it lacks the day one DLC bullshit, well too bad. Buy it and you get all that shit."
,Patone,2012-08-26T14:31Z,This shit doesn't work either don't bother downloading
,anonyboy,2012-08-27T02:39Z,OmniNegro's instructions worked flawlessly for me.
,freaky.X,2012-08-27T09:48Z,this crack fix works perfectly!! Thanks..

,cooljzer,2012-09-09T20:01Z,does any one have problems with their saved games being reset every time they quit their game 
,rajtalreja,2012-09-11T21:13Z,this did not work for me. says budha.dll is missing ( anytime I download this file my antivirus popup and say nothing to clean or delete but buddha.dll deleted automatically ) what to do ??
,rajtalreja,2012-09-11T21:14Z,"even i shutdown the antivirus from the process aswell , when i copy budha.dll and try paste then it say u need permission to copy but file goes in air lol means no file at all, i also tried from dvd but it is not allowing me at all.. :("
,leviathanoz,2012-09-12T11:01Z,"Weird...My computer removes buddah.dll without even telling me. Tried shutting down both my firewall and AVG, it yet wont download the buddah file...
What do I do?"
,leviathanoz,2012-09-12T11:15Z,"Yep I got the same problem as above. It warned me about it, and then today when I reinstall the game I turned of both AVG and my firewall, but instead it just deleted the file automatically."
