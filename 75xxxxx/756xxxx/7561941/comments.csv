Karina is rather easy on the eye, I've never heard of her before, and apart from this series, I expect not to hear of her again.

Anyway, the animal sanctuarys are tremendous, and really, the six episodes are very exciting.  The 720p clarity is terrific.

If a fully grown male lion charged me, I might expect the dung beetles to be processing a bit of human poo!  She handles all the dramatic situations very well.

I wonder if Zimbabwe is safe enough for tourists to visit?"
