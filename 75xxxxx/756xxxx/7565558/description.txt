[b]Storyline[/b]
In this game, you play in the Marvel Ultimate Universe where Peter Parker is a young teenager trying to lead a normal life despite the fact that he's the Amazing Spider-Man. In addition, you also control Eddie Brock, a childhood friend who took a prototype experiment of his and Peter's fathers to become the murderous monster, Venom. While you help the innocent among your challenges as Spider-Man, you also rampage as Venom as events build to a final confrontation that both allies like Nick Fury or enemies like The Vulture cannot prevent.
