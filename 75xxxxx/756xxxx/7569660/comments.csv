Plus it's a widescreen movie encoded to fullscreen with black bars, so it is centered on the screen without making full use of the width or height. It artifacts left and right and looks really chunky. I encoded the 3d re-release of Beauty and the Beast to look way better than this and it only turned out to be 3.37 GB, and I doubt this film is over twice as long.

Just use the converter found on GBATemp. I found setting the video quality to 3 to be the best setting. 1 stutters a bit on the device. I only decided to try this to avoid booting into my Windows partition for a few hours, I prefer OS X but there's no converter for it yet."
