Bio from Last.fm:

From Atlantis is a six member band from the heart of Providence, Rhode Island. They were recently approached by Outerloop Management for booking and promotional purposes. The band has been spending a great deal of their time developing a unique sound and writing new material at Swordfish Studios with producer/engineer Landon Tewers (vocalist of The Plot In You). New and exciting things are transpiring, including member changes and upcoming tours. They will surely be on their way to a venue near you soon. Their talents are fully devoted and geared towards their growing fan base. From Atlantis brings ample amounts of heavy riffage, catchy beats, and melodic overtones. These well constructed elements are ever present in the bandΓÇÖs songwriting structure and will never cease to impress fans of the genre.
