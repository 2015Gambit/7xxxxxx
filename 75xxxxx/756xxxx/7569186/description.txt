Note: READNFO: Video has that killer crop which means the video is missing a
portion at the bottom of the screen (Damn chairs!) so just a warning if you
couldn't already tell from the screenshots and the sample. Just the standard work
done here, filtered, tweaked then dropped the file size. This would have been an
amazing CAM if it wasn't for the crop. But still a solid - A:7/V:7 - Enjoy!
