I haven't been ignoring you

It's just that I haven't checked my email for several days as I've been extremely busy.

I will check them tonight  "

Images are not loading by time, even I disable my adblocker & pop up blocker still images are not loading......

yes, you's right, I should be gentle on uploaders. but BBS is Favorite uploader and have communicate with the uploader several times.....I expect a lot from him ;)  "
