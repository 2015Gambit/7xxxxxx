,gamer2010,2012-08-25T20:53Z,greeat thank you tr< the just flight model too
,virtualanarchy,2012-08-25T22:22Z,Hmm... If it's anything like the QW757 we're going to need a .reg file. I'll try an enable button to get the exe cracked.
,klyd971,2012-08-25T23:10Z,"Thanks,
Installation does not ask for key or what so ever...
Is it the original exe or already debugged?

And if Virtual's right, anyone knows a tuto for reg. 
thks"
,deves1,2012-08-26T01:29Z,Ive tried a enable button from a pmdg package tat does not work. Installed the with exe and none of the gauges work. 
,WJSS12,2012-08-26T01:55Z,So I am guessing that the RIP won't work either then?
,virtualanarchy,2012-08-26T02:06Z,"Everything works except for the gauges. F.B.I is there any way you can get all the gauges from your product (after you've installed and completed every necessary task to get this working) ((assuming you paid)), and upload them here so I can see if plugging them in will work?"
,virtualanarchy,2012-08-26T02:10Z,Along with your QWings.dll which can be found in your QualityWings folder.
,namco-nexgen,2012-08-26T02:55Z,"Some pro cracker has to have a look at this and provide a keygen. Same with all F1 products, once one is done, they're all done.

Thing is, someone inside the ""scene"" has to make these files get to a patient cracker so he can work his magic."
,virtualanarchy,2012-08-26T03:12Z,A keygen isn't needed because it doesn't even ask for a KEY! We need someone to patch the .gau files but I want to see if there is a difference between the ones that are legit and the ones that are uploaded.
,namco-nexgen,2012-08-26T03:40Z,"A keygen would be needed because the .lic file is generated depending on the machine. Each machine has its own.

Patching the .gau files would be another way to do it, and probably less tedious..."
,ingr.osei,2012-08-26T14:34Z,I GUESS PEOPLE LIKE KOMU OR SNAKE EYE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE GAUGES WITH EASE.
,ambroz24,2012-08-26T15:01Z,cls just flight bae 146 please

,camus_to,2012-08-26T17:32Z,"ingr.osei, how about your capt sim 737? we are stuck at 8.9%. Please seed. Thanks!"
,ambroz24,2012-08-26T17:38Z,camus_to: can you give me the link to that 737 i will downloaded to if its a working model
,Chugalugg,2012-08-26T18:13Z,"ambroz24, its not a working model, this little prick ingr.osei, thinks its quite funny uploading his fake torrent, then watching everyone scream for him to seed as he sits back and laughs. Then this little scum fuck goes on other torrents and offers comments or makes requests. What a fucking little ball sack. "
,ambroz24,2012-08-26T20:10Z,so is this working now or ???
,Chugalugg,2012-08-26T23:37Z,"ambroz24, nope. It was FBI's intention to get this worked on only."
,ambroz24,2012-08-27T00:47Z,i see well i hope somebody uploads the just flight model soon i can t wait much longer for this plane 
,ambroz24,2012-08-27T00:48Z,Chugalugg: ca you try cracking this ? you or fbi. please

,ambroz24,2012-08-27T11:03Z,ingr.osei : does your model work ?
,ingr.osei,2012-08-27T11:08Z,"@Chugalugg,it seems you have a very serious mental issue,how many times have I told you that I have difficulty seeding,are you alright at all.My ISP is messing me up,secondly my extremely busy work schedule is another issue,I fly for an airline something you might wanna do with glee someday.watch your tongue 'coz I'm old enough to be your father,I'm not a kid,FS is only a hobby not what I do for a living,I've long gone beyond desktop simming,I fly the real birds,get that into your thick skull and stop making silly comments about me, besides what do I gain by messing up with people's emotions;what do I gain by fooling around with people,I have a heart okay.let this be the last time I hear this kind of nonsense from you.If you feel you are better than any other individual on this great website then fork out $40.00 and buy yourself a copy.to hell with you."
,ingr.osei,2012-08-27T11:13Z,"@camus_to:would it be a reasonable idea to upload it unto a website like mediafire or something and then post the link,perhaps its faster that way,please advise me on that,I'm prepared to do anything to share the software with you guys,I only need some quick tips to make things faster,please help out."

,pXoneX,2012-08-27T17:39Z,Can someone crack it please. I relay wont this aircraft pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  
,boinga,2012-08-27T18:31Z,ingr.osei dont worry about not been able to make sth. just try your best and if possible look on Google -there is everything you may need to know to upload a file and seed it.I see that you do your best and as I now understand that FSX isn't your day job I take may bad words back! best wishes and safe landings!!
,Chugalugg,2012-08-27T18:33Z,"ingr.osei, You are so full of shit its not even funny, so your telling us that a professional pilot, as you state you are, is here on the Bay crying for aircraft to be uploaded. Your Professional salary won't cover your needs and that you would risk your career by using torrent sites? You are full of shit. And by the way, the only thing you've ever been old enough to Father, is a turd in the toilet. "
,CRUZ2219,2012-08-27T23:13Z,"almost the entire airplane works just a few things in the main panel like the altitude and the speed indicator does not work, appears black!!!! somebody need to crack these beautiful plane!!!!!! "
,ingr.osei,2012-08-27T23:35Z,"@Chugalugg,I really don't see why you keep whining ,I paid for this product and tried to upload it without success,if you really can't control your feelings then perhaps like I said earlier on it's only $40.00 go get yourself a copy and stop misbehaving. 
For the benefit of this community I'l keep at it till I succeed.
Non entities like you don't matter and for your information I've just paid for the CLS BAe 146  but YOU in particular can't have it;learn to work and earn a living.have a good night's rest,you've burnt too much energy railing at me haven't you,you must grow up and be a man;it's quite late at my part of the Globe and I need some rest after a hard days work."
,ambroz24,2012-08-27T23:54Z,why nobd tries to get the just flight model its easier to crack and simple to fly
,ambroz24,2012-08-28T00:38Z,ingr.osei : thak you so much for buying the cls bae 146  i hope you l be able to upload it 
,Chugalugg,2012-08-28T01:22Z,"ingr.osei, The only hard days work you've ever done is jerking off to one of your many goats. Now please tell us all about your illustrious Commercial Pilots career, lol. What year did you get your certification ticket, lol. Where in the Globe did you mention you were? Please tell us Captain Crunch. Your so fucking full of shit you can't keep your lies straight. "
,bazzelbrush,2012-08-28T01:27Z,"It should be easy to crack this. I noticed after installing some of the gauges are not displaying. What you'll need to do is open the XML file in C:UserscomputerAppDataRoamingMicrosoftFSX

,bazzelbrush,2012-08-28T07:14Z,You need the dll file out of C:UserscomputerAppDataRoamingMicrosoftFSX to crack this. it will be a line in the dll file that needs to be added to others for this to work 100% 
,ambroz24,2012-08-28T08:04Z,bazzelbrush: so you hawe to copy that file that you r saying about to fsx gauges and owerwrite it??

,boinga,2012-08-28T09:48Z,I want to ask is it only the gadgets the thing that doesn't work or the gear ttoo?
,ambroz24,2012-08-28T10:33Z,only the gadgets i think gear works 
,ingr.osei,2012-08-28T12:27Z,"@Ambroz24 and Boinga; gentlemen I'm seeding the captainsim 737 and for good measure I've added the 777 (I had to prune down the airline skins to just 2)as well,unfortunately I forgot to tag it FSX,that was quite silly of me,however you'd get the files when you type CAPTAINSIM,the upload is quite slow but I trust we'll get the soon,please feel free to give it a shot and let me have your remarks.

Have a nice day guys."
,ingr.osei,2012-08-28T12:34Z,"Ambroz24 please give me a little time and i'll get the stuff up to you K?,it's a pity my schedules keep me away from home most of the time but I think I do owe you this one,I'll make it up to you."

How you live your life is up to you.I'm done with you,Stay blessed."
,ambroz24,2012-08-28T13:17Z,thank you il start downloading 737 right away looking forward too try it . i hope you make it to get more liveries. thank you
,ambroz24,2012-08-28T17:19Z,ingr.osei : i hawe just one last wish when you will hawe time please try to crack this or something its great add on and you would make a lot of people happy. http://www.fsdreamteam.com/products_gsx.html
,Chugalugg,2012-08-28T21:22Z," Captain ingr.osei, Haaaaaaaaaaa, you fooled me with your first troll torrent, but it won't happen again. I'd rather purchase than to use anything from you! Now back to your goats, you bullshit artist. "
,virtualanarchy,2012-08-29T03:06Z,"Okay. I see you two fighting in every fucking FSX torrent on the bay, so let's set things straight right now.
1) IF ingr.osei's torrents ARE fake, then that's on him. He has 5 up and just learned how to seed all of them. If someone confirms that it's not the real deal, then that's on him and no one will care for his torrents. Big whoop.
2) Anyone can lie on the internet. If he says he's a pilot you either believe it or you don't. I can say I won the lottery but you don't know. Point being, to go around calling him a liar and a lot of other nasty names fixes nothing.
3)About the nasty names, it's really getting bad. I could handle liar because of the whole seeding issue, even asshole because maybe it seemed like it was on purpose. But a goat fucker? Are you mentally ill? That is disgusting and you should feel ashamed. 

I don't want any issues here anymore. It's annoying trying to find a good, helpful comment and seeing you guys go back and forth.

STOP. IT."
,Chugalugg,2012-08-29T04:43Z,"virtualanarchy,AndroidSSoft and 3 other fags are sitting in a hot tub. They notice some sperm rising to the surface. One fag says, ""Ok, who farted?"" Now, what were you saying disgusting? Fuck you, you hypocrite."
,Chugalugg,2012-08-29T05:14Z,"Called him alot of shit, that's right. But never called him a goat fucker! I said he jerks off to them. LOL."
,ingr.osei,2012-08-29T09:10Z," @virtualanarchy:You are very right,I over reacted to chugalugs invectives and said some really crazy things; I am very sorry about that man;even though I felt very bad about his actions,perhaps it would have been wiser keeping quiet instead;it hurts when people insult you for doing no wrong.but its okay ;I'd like to apologise to everyone on this website,I'm very sorry."
,ingr.osei,2012-08-29T09:38Z,"AMBROZ24:My good friend,I would not want to make empty promises,neither would I want to beguile anyone especally friends on the bay like you;would you have me upload radar contact 4.3 instead,its machine specific so you might have to generate a key with olly debugger.stay blessed.pls let me know if the 737 is complete.thanx"
,ambroz24,2012-08-29T09:52Z,not sure what you mean with radar contact 4??
,ambroz24,2012-08-29T12:27Z,well i can t download it yet no seeds :((
,Chugalugg,2012-08-29T16:25Z,"This guy ingr.osei should be banned from here for pulling this shit over and over, wasting people time and bandwidth intentionally. As I've said all along about this Bozo, if he follows through on his uploads for the other members then i'll shut my mouth, but as of now this guy is getting one big kick off of doing this shit. So whats worse, me calling him out or him for the shit hes been pulling? I'm through with this shit."
,Chugalugg,2012-08-29T16:38Z,"This shithead ingr.osei first torrent was posted 18 days ago and he has not finished one of them. His latest phony torrent, has people shutdown at 80%. This motherfucker is laughing his ass off at you guys. "

,Chugalugg,2012-08-29T17:21Z,"vittupaa1980, BLOW ME."
,ingr.osei,2012-08-29T17:22Z,"@chugalugg,like I my ISP keeps ""dissing"" me like,besides I'm not even at home at the moment. a thousand apologies,but it should not stop at 80% and I'm not getting any kicks from this unfortunate occurance,I'm human;like I said I don't mess with people's emotions.
I work in West Africa and trust me the network can be a bit difficult to handle.
At least I left home yesterday whilst it was seeding.
I pray it finishes seeding before the week runs,others who download fully can then do me a favour by seeding from there.
I have my phone' browser on piratebay.org 24/7 because i want to monitor what is happening to the torrent."

,Chugalugg,2012-08-29T20:05Z,"Agreed, NIGERIAN SCAM ARTIST, he even uses the Nigerian word for trouble {Wahala}. Stay away from this motherfucker."
,vittupaa1980,2012-08-29T20:30Z,"There are lot of people in this planet sadly some of them are assholes. And this chugalugg belongs in this group of assholes. he is like stream of shit flowing in to forums and bays of world wide web. U cant blame him for that really. my guess is that he has been abandoned by his friends and family becouse every time he opens his mouth only thing that comes out is bad smell and some little bites of shit. So now only thing left is this empty shell of what used to be a human. He sits in his apartment somewhere whit his computer (only friend left) and types some shit on forums, for hope of some argument or little chat. Thats is the only way he knows he is still a live and thats his only connection to other people.  Best way to block these kind of stream of shit is just dont ignore them. If u block the stream the stream will change direction and eventually he will be gone for good.....maybe forever."
