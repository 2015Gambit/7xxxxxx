1, GUYS THIS IS AN UN-CRACKED VERSION, IT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK.
2, FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE THE .DLL WILL LOOK FOR A .LIC FILE TO AUTHENTICATE THE PRODUCT.
3, THERE IS TWO FOLDERS ONE IS A .EXE (MAYBE SOMEONE CAN CRACK),
4, THE SECOND FOLDER IS A RIP OF THE PRODUCT, JUST PUT THINGS IN THERE FOLDER IN THE MAIN FSX DIRECTORY.

I.E Copy Contents of folders
Effect- To your fsx Effects Folder
Gauges- To your fsx Gauges folder
Qualitywings folder- Copy the whole folder to your fsx directory
Sim Objects-Copy folder contents to Sim Objects>Airplanes folder.

THIS IS P3D COMPATABLE TOO.

GOOD LUCK ON CRACKING IT.

F.B.I
