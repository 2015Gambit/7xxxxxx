The Scole Experiment chronicles the extraordinary results of a five-year investigation into life after death. At the beginning of 1993 four psychic researchers embarked on a series of experiments in the Norfolk village of Scole. The subsequent events were so astounding that senior members of the prestigious Society for Psychical Research asked to observe, test and record what took place.

,BKKJack,2012-08-25T00:00Z,"The Scole ""'report"" simply doesn't hold up and wouldn't under the scrutiny of a 5 year old.
The investigators were not allowed to impose any controls on the mediums whereas they in turn had to bend to the demands put on them by the mediums. 

It merely highlighted the growing need in the technological age for these frauds to somehow appear methodical or scientific, when in truth, anyone showing even the slightest sceptical tendencies was excluded from the ""experiment"".

Even the SPR try to distance themselves from the whole affair these days.

Still, this doc does show what lengths of desperation the group would go to to try and ""prove"" the existence of ghosts or the afterlife, yet in truth after 5 years they were left with absolutely nothing tangible. 

Nice find psspsss.

Cheers."
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T00:56Z,"i wake up to find its slowed down cos a couple leeched... 

I did warn leechers to stay off else utorrent will punish everyone when a ratio is met"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T01:20Z,"if the photos and evps were fake

it would be nice if someone would recreate each scene and get the exact same results

the key being exact

its no good saying its fraud.. they have to prove it was

I have to agree the flowers scene was a bit suspect"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T01:30Z,"OK it has over 45 real seeders now

so I LEAVE YOU ALL TO IT"
,BKKJack,2012-08-25T02:01Z,"Mark Edward  and Brian Dunning made a doc on Discovery around about a year or so ago where they did just that.

Whilst neither Dunning nor Edward could be called un-biased, it really made for compelling viewing. "
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T02:41Z,"

I think you mean so called mentalists and magicians showing how it could be done
some of it..at least

Im sure i would of seen it.. and it didnt impress me if I did as I would of recalled it

after all fact and faked couldnt replicate the ghost writing on film"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T03:10Z,"

anyhow discy and hist channel is run by a bunch of Jesus freaks
who put on content for the pro existence of god
over shows debunking god..

they still pushing the non sense of the big banf being proven when its full of hole.. not just black ones

anyhow proving something can be faked and getting similar results dones not equal
getting the EXACT same results

like fact or fake cos they can show how it could be faked dont mean it was faked..
like the UFO debunks they did.. then they capture their own ufos on their expensive gear they cant explain away

and ghost stuff also,, they caught some of the best evps and stuff on thernal when debunking ghosts LOL"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T03:11Z,darn spotted typos.. wish here had edit like demon had
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T03:22Z,"

Remember THOUGH this is a docu showing for the first time the results and findings of the experiment
among other stuff and putting some thing to the test.. its not completely one sided

its also non wide screen.. but then I guess 7 years ago.. WS affordable cameras didnt exist"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T04:49Z,"
WELL having just watched it all properly I have to say its one of the best Paranormal documentaries made for a while

now we need someone to do this again with modern tech and more debunking and get results
as these results going by time stamps on some video was done in 1998 to 2003 ??

also those tne followers who hate me and claim not to download the paranormal stuff I up
will miss out indeed if they dont watch this :))"
,LJE111,2012-08-25T11:49Z,"Thank psspss! Wanted to see this. 

Here's the link to the website for more info:

Thanks again for uploading this! Demonoid usually has the best docu's - was hoping some of these programs might make it to TPB now."
,BKKJack,2012-08-25T12:58Z,"I found it stupendously one-sided as it even starts off on the incorrect premise that the experiments were a) scientific in nature and b) provided irrefutable scientific evidence. 

Frankly I feel docs like these do very little for serious paranormal research whatsoever. There is no balance, no analysis and absolutely zero science. Just the members of the group trying to flog a dead horse."
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T14:22Z,"sounds like didnt watch it all with a openmind at all

or just the first 10min

as the scientists there said.. they tried everything to debunk various experimentds


1) remove tubes from the radio so technically it should work but did
2) they put in in a faraday cage and still got evps
3) the scientists brought their own polaroid in seal containers and they only ones to handle it and still pictures showed up using their own processing machines

if its a trick they pulled some clever shit on people'


polaroid is the hardest film to fake shit on it

still I would of wanted a full spectrum in the room but they werent about then. and a thermal to debink the lights that passed through table and people"
[V],psspss,2012-08-25T14:23Z,"shouldnt work I meant

debunk not debink :)

right off to bed again... typos setting in. :)"
