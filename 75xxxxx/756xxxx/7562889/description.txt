As Americans, liberty is an inalienable right that is granted to us by God, protected by the Constitution, and upheld by our government. Yet, Barack Obama doesnΓÇÖt seem to share that view. To him, liberty is a threat to the governmentΓÇÖs power and something to be squashed by any means possible, as bestselling author David Limbaugh shows to devastating effect in his new book, Crimes Against Liberty. In Crimes Against Liberty, Limbaugh issues a damning indictment of President Barack Obama for encroaching upon and stripping us of our individual and sovereign rights. 


Laying out his case like he would a criminal complaint, Limbaugh presents the evidenceΓÇöcount-by-countΓÇöagainst Obama. From exploiting the financial crisis for political gain, to restricting our personal freedoms through invasive healthcare and ΓÇ£greenΓÇ¥ policies, to endangering America with his feckless diplomacy and reckless dismantlement of our national security systems, Limbaugh provesΓÇöbeyond a reasonable doubtΓÇöthat Obama is guilty of crimes against liberty. Comprehensive and compelling, this is LimbaughΓÇÖs most powerful book yet.
