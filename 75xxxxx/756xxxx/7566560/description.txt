This is the most entertaining version of The Merchant of Venice, it seems to have appeared first on Masterpiece Theatre. This version is set in Venice (?) during the 1920's, and has a lot of jazz and shimmy. The actors put so much emotion into their lines, you can understand the meaning even though it's still Elizabethan English.

Trevor Nunn obviously put a great deal of imagination into this, thus you have "suitors" introduced on silent film rather than paintings. I could go on about this... just see it!
