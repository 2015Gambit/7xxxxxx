Your  ATTENTION  please! If you downloaded this - or any other TLT release - from a website such as MP3GALAXY, be informed that you are a PIECE OF WORTHLESS CRAP. Indeed. You and the operators of places such as MP3GALAXY do NOT rip the mP3s themselves. TLT is in NO WAY related to any of these websites. It's in our .NFO for quite some time: Team TLT does  NOT  want their releases  to be spread to websites, public FTPs, XDCC bots, P2P systems - or whatever crosses your freesharing mind. To the underage bastards that run  MP3GALAXY  to impress or whatever stupid reason they might have to do so: STOP publishing  Team TLT  releases  on  your  lame  website. Whoever downloads stuff from there: You're just about as useless. No, wait. You're even more useless.

Seriously, they could get their faces crashed for such shit. Fuck those who keep the scene closed! Torrents are our saviors!"

Why did they?"
[V],Petey85,2012-08-25T14:05Z,"cuz scene-releases are for scene only :)

they're not making those releases for us :)"
,torrent-cracker,2012-08-25T23:54Z,"And what's the point in making these releases, then? If they don't wanna share, let 'em die."
