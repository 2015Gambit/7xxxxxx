The classic album from Kiss Newly Remixed from the original tapes by Bob Ezrin. This is just a sloppy DTS upmix I used by repeating the channels from front to surround and making both channels to mono for center and boombox.
If you think that's shitty, don't download! I'm satisfied with the noise it makes...
