Requirements: Android OS 2.2 +
Overview: Light Flow allows you to take control of your notification LED or trackball colors and makes them successively flash one color after another.


It also allows you to set repeating sounds on vibration patterns for you notifications. You can also set a "sleep time" or "on charge" where the lights and/or sounds and vibrations will not be heard or seen.

It works on non-rooted phones and also allows the colors to flash in succession, so if you have a new SMS and a missed call it can alternate between the two colors. You can also set which notification type has the highest priority and let it flash in just that one color.

There's different profiles for when your phone is charging and when it is running on battery. If you find it eats your battery too much for your liking then you can change settings to conserve the battery use.
