I am no jew boy but its been at least 2,000 years of unfair persecution and oppression, just because they loved freedom SO MUCH that they were the only people which did not submit to the Romans, so they were massacred and expelled from their own land.

Forced by christians in the Middle Ages to go into finances (they could not own land or have christian servants) they were squeezed by christian nobles for money, then they were expelled or massacred, not to speak of the horrid Holocaust at the hand of the evil nazis...

Such people won over 200 Nobel prizes, a great contribution to mankind, still are despised and hated by many.

Will decent people learn to appreciate them and learn from their good things and at last make them feel accepted and respected? If not, mankind is a rotten bunch...
