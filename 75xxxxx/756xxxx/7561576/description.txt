1. A Burden for Men
2. Male and Female
3. Hard at Work
4. Making Disciples

When God numbered Israel, He counted the men over twenty who were able to fight. When Jesus began to build his Church, He chose twelve men, most of whom worked with their hands. The New Testament letters are well addressed to 'brothers'...

Why is it easier to get women converted than men?
What are the differences between men and women?
Is a man's daily work a necessary evil or is his full-time Christian service?
How can we disciple men today?

These and many other questions about the roles and responsibilities of men are answered by David Pawson, who for some years has been leading seminars for men in this Country and overseas under the banner of 'Men for God'.

These two DVDs, have a total running time of five and a half hours, divided into four sections. They are designed for men to study and discuss together in groups or for personal use.
