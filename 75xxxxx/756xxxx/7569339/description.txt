Match of the Day 25.08.2012

Duration: 1 Hour, 30 Min

Gary Lineker introduces the best of the action and reaction from the day's eight Premier League matches.

Chelsea took on Newcastle in the standout fixture. Last season the away side triumphed in both league games and surprisingly there has not being a home winner in this fixture since 2007 - a run of seven matches.

Southampton welcomed Wigan to St Mary's - Saints' first top flight home game in over seven years. The two clubs have never met in league competition before. Their only previous contest came in a 3-0 FA Cup victory for Southampton in 1986, at the former home of The Dell.

Elsewhere, Manchester United took on Fulham at Old Trafford, a side they have beaten 10 times in 11 Premier League matches, the exception being a 3-1 defeat nine years ago.
