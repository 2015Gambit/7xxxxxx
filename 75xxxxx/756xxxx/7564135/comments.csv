,pirateshoman,2012-08-26T14:22Z,Anybody watched this? is it any good movie? and the A/V/M comments please!
,ninjadre,2012-08-26T15:37Z,"great story, destroyed by awful production and directing.

The actors are doing a good job, at least some of them. But the director and producer seem to have been making a stupid and annoying soap opera. What is it with that annoying dramatic music throughout the entire film, it is disturbing the whole story, and it is not dramatic, it feels like I am watching a very very bad episode of a soap. 

Misplaced music, bad sounding. Most sounds like phone ringing and stuff is like added after they filmed it, and so bad that you actually can hear it is in a studio. not very good produced I must say.

If this story was made in a Hollywood production it would absolutely have been better, the whole concept is great, but with such crappy filmmakers it must have been doomed from the start. This story need some great sci-fi filmmakers, then it would be a box office most likely.

Sorry guys put this is NOT worth watching at all."
,T.Paine,2012-08-26T19:16Z,"First, thanks much to scene4all for the upload!

A:8 (music to loud and inappropriate in portions of the movie -- this is the studio's fault-- not the ripper's, otherwise the sound is good.)

V:8 (watchable, even on large screens, not too many artifacts-- you won't see them if you are watching the movie and not looking for artifacts.)

M:0 (without subtitles)
M:7 (with subtitles)

This movie might have been good enough to watch, were it not for the long conversations in Portuguese.  There is some of this at the very beginning of the movie, and then later there is a very long and important conversation with the main character (speaking English) with another character (speaking Portuguese).  This conversation is the *WHY* of the whole movie, and unless you have subtitles, you are going to miss the whole point.  So, this will be a total loss for you unless you can find some English subtitles (especially for the non-English bits), or you are fluent in both English and Portuguese.

Perhaps if some nice person that speaks both English and Portuguese can create an SRT (subtitles) file for the Portuguese bits, this upload will be great."

,frm0025,2012-08-28T05:00Z,"This is wayne.bmw's ex boyfriend. Sorry for his racist remarks. Due to me being a negro man and him being vanilla he used our break up as a launch pad in becomming a racist fuck wad. I gave him some of the best ""nigger dick"" as he would say a man can give another man. I tore that asshole from cheek to shining cheek. I apologize that his asshole remarks have bled into thepiratebay. If I knew I was creating a monster I'd have never pounded dat ass. It's hard for white men with their first taste of black dick to deal with the fact they will never be able to enjoy a white cock again. Some guys force their white counterparts to have penis extension surgery to gain thr pleasure. Others like Wayne become bitter and go on racist tirades. When he gives into the dark side the tirades will stop. Wayne if your out there come home honey. I haven't found an asshole as tight and supple as yours. No matter what you call me you can't deny I tore that ass up!"
,WinVery.com,2012-08-28T06:57Z,I don't give a fuck about a movie called Area Q lol
,oigveh,2012-08-28T16:39Z,"cmon, wayne.bmw is obviously black.  i mean, who else would add .bmw to a name.  therefore he is NOT racist.  you know, like the rappers say nigga every other word, but ol' whitey can't.  axe any black, they'll comfirm this"
,oigveh,2012-08-28T16:47Z,"stop getting hung up on racism, what about all the comments that are sexually prejudice, i mean, they are trying to cut him/her up by using gay remarks.  I thought gay was no longer a bad thing?  I hope frm0025 doesn't have kids, he's obviously a molester, too much detail not to be"
,weirwolfe,2012-08-29T03:06Z,"A=6, V=8. An interesting premise. No subs for the non English speaking parts makes it a frustrating watch. Good acting on most counts. Definately a B grade sci fi. Movie= 7. "
