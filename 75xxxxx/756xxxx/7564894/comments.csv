,Asgen,2012-08-25T14:04Z,Very nice job by nosTEAM! Run an exe file and it installs everything and even makes a shortcut on the desktop ready to play and worked flawlessly for a 6 hour session of gaming no problems at all.

,Nag1ka,2012-09-01T01:01Z,"Has anyone figured out the cause/solution for the game crashing after pressing ""new game""?

This is the version I installed, I've tried multiple of the cracks available on the website, and even tried the update from v1.4 to v1.5.

I've also bypassed the anti-virus, made sure that I only have c++ x86 versions, 

Any Ideas?"
,dandalis,2012-09-01T01:49Z,can u plz upload 1.4 and 1.5 updates seperated from game plz ?
