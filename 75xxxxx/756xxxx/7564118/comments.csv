,magicthunder,2012-09-08T04:09Z,when will u upload season 15 @pirateboy???
[T],PirateBoy,2012-09-09T06:46Z,"There isn't any season 15 yet of One Piece. The season 14 is still continuing. I will upload season 14 part 2 once its complete. For details, check here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_one_piece_episodes"
,magicthunder,2012-09-10T20:31Z,"that means u will upload season part 2 after October 7, 2012 ?? can u upload episodes 523 to 563 for now and remaining after that?? @pirateboy"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-09-11T04:11Z,"Well i know that you are very eager to have the episodes. But, actually I only upload those seasons which are complete. So, you have to wait for some time. And the reason I uploaded season 14 in 2 parts is that this season is very big. Meanwhile I will upload other animes"
,magicthunder,2012-09-11T19:32Z,thankx for the rply !!
,juvs,2012-09-12T04:27Z,can you upload fairy tail
,FZ123,2012-09-14T22:15Z,"Hi I know you don't want to upload part two until the season is complete, but could you at least upload in batches of ten or something? That will make it easier for those who want to catch up so they don't have to track down and download 42 different torrents."
,FZ123,2012-09-14T22:36Z,"I'm confused, Wikipedia says that the last episode will be broadcasted September 16, two days from today. So why do we have to wait until October?"
,zaroba,2012-09-16T01:59Z,"ty for the upload, but why are the episodes split into 2 parts?

And what's with the episodes that are at 400x224 or 400x230?   So tiny to watch on a tv or pc.  Fullscrening a 400x230 to fill a 1920x1280 pc screen or a 46"" lcd tv doesn't look very good."
