Requirements: 2.0ΓÇô2.3.7
Overview: The official Jenga┬« game is here!


REALISTIC PHYSICS
Real-time 3D physics simulation, authentically recreating the behavior of a real wooden Jenga tower. Each block is realistically affected by the surrounding blocks, recreating the same strategic depth as the original game.

TOUCH CONTROL
Anyone whoΓÇÖs played Jenga knows how delicate your touch needs to be. Your Android deviceΓÇÖs touch screen gives you the control youΓÇÖll need to go for world record heights (incidentallyΓÇª the record is 40 2/3 layers!). Blocks can be teased out using a mix of gentle tapping and drag controls. ItΓÇÖs easy to begin with, but youΓÇÖll soon find it tough when the pressure is on and the tower is wobbling!


v1.83:
CROSS PLATFORM MULTIPLAYER
Multiplayer just got better! If you have friends playing on other mobile devices you can now also enjoy playing against them too.
CHAT
Send a text message to your opponent with each move in an Online game. Try to be nice though, being nice is a nice thing to do.
XP Levels
Now every move and every completed game in Online earns you XP. Level up through a series of XP Levels. Can you make it from Sawdust Sweeper to Grand Axe Master?
