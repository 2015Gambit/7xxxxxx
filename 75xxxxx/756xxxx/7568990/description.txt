Issues 1-4 of 'Dare - The Controversial Memoir of Dan Dare'

by Grant Morrison and Ryan Hughes

I'm not sure exactly which version this is as I can't find a listing for a four issue mini-series of this book. It is, however, four issues, priced at $2.75 each. It is not the TPB, nor the original Revolver or Crisis versions.

I have pretty much everything Grant Morrison has ever done, so if there is something you're looking for that isn't already available on TPB, or is inside this awesome collection right here...

...but you'd rather have it as it's own torrent, just drop a comment and I'll seed it.
