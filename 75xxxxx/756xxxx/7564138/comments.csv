,mikefallon,2012-08-25T19:21Z,"I wouldn't bother pointing out the IMDB is 2.3/10 from 6 user as the test group size of 6 is so small the score is irrelevant.
This could equally be a 0.5 or a 9.5."
,arildus,2012-08-26T00:01Z,Thanx:)
,Rush,2012-08-26T01:01Z,"@mikefallon..... yup, with's it overwhelming popularity I'm sure it's a ""9.5""  lmao"
,Rush,2012-08-26T01:04Z,"""The movie is not as good as the cover may lead you to believe. 
Amateur camera work along with some amateur acting is all that this movie had to deliver. The story line is what it is.
 I suppose that these types of movies are released to the public so that perhaps the actors and directors may get discovered. 
The movie could have been a lot more better had the directors given it more time and thought. 
Well, I guess the bottom line in the a fore stated is that people have to start somewhere. 
If the camera crew or the actual camera man would do a better job then it wouldn't make the acting seem amateur. 
I was forced to skim thru the movie in about 5 
minutes because it just wasn't really delivering.""

Ummmm yea, this is the ONLY review on IMBD sounds awesome so far, lots of green bud might be in order"

,GurkeyMai,2012-08-27T03:28Z,"Don't forget this review posted on the message boards:

""So many users ignorantly say oh it's the worst movie I've ever seen!

And I attack them saying you don't know what bad film making is!This is as bad as they come, and I've rated over 3,700 films here. This one truly earned a 1/10. I say plant an IED in the ground and have everyone connected to the film stand over it for a picture! """

,connor17,2012-08-27T16:34Z,"@ronin324, the best movie of all time is street fighter with Jean-Claude Van Damme"
,SlipTronX,2012-08-28T00:33Z,"I never post a comment on bad movies but this one I had to.Dont waste your time with this one,it's bad.it's not even the kinda movie you can enjoy because of how cheesey it is.halloween store make-up vampires,horrible acting and even worse plot.in the begining some how 20 hicks in white sheets with guns some how take over a city and make vampires come out of a grave yard with some half ass ritual.one vampire throws a tank(bad cgi) but cant chase down a girl after she runs in2 a house.Bad scenes like that over and over and thats the movie.read a book,stare at a wall,all better uses of your time than watching this"
,snowstone,2012-08-28T04:59Z,damn that picture looks great but then i look at a trailer... im just going to skip this lol
,arildus,2012-08-28T13:20Z,Pure Crap!!
,burt64nyg,2012-08-28T15:21Z,"This is a total backyarder! As a matter of fact, if they had awards for backyarders, this would win best picture. (Backyarders are movies like the original Night of the Living Dead and Clerks where the movie looks like it was filmed in the directors parents backyard or filmed in the directors hometown.)"
,bobalazs,2012-08-28T18:56Z,"piece of shit movie, don't watch. I know i couldn't.
Some guy with a 20$ camera made this probably."
,Cyrusxo,2012-08-29T02:02Z,LOW budget.. Horrible Movie!! 
,Cyberdactyl,2012-08-31T02:46Z,"V8

M. . .be serious

This is barely better than a 200 series film making course with classmates who could give a fuck what grade they get and a budget provided by one of the students selling their 2001 Volvo."
,butters72,2012-09-09T19:17Z,"Total Waste of Time!
