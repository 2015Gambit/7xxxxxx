           Release Notes:
         
           Tiny Troopers puts you in command of a team of small soldiers. Guide
           them through 30 deadly missions with varied objectives: destroy enemy
           armoured formations, save hostages and eliminate enemy generals, to
           name but just a few.
         
           Your troopers will face enemy infantry, snipers, ætechnicalsÆ and even
           tanks. The casualty rate is going to be high but thereÆs an endless
           supply of fresh recruits to step up and fill the ranks. Those lucky
           troopers who survive from mission to mission will be promoted, and each
           new stripe they gain makes them tougher.
         
           To increase your troopersÆ chances of survival, use Command Points to
           give them better equipment, reinforce their team with a specialist
           like machinegunner, medic or delta force and call in support drops
           during missions.
         
           War might be hell but this is the funniest way to fight in one!
