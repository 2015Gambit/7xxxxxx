The shocking techno-thriller that cements Daniel SuarezΓÇÖs status as the heir to Michael Crichton and Tom ClancyΓÇöa terrifying, breathtaking, and all-too-plausible vision of the worldΓÇÖs near future.

Unmanned weaponized drones already existΓÇötheyΓÇÖre widely used by America in our war efforts in the Middle East. In Kill Decision, bestselling author Daniel Suarez takes that fact and the real science behind it one step further, with frightening results.

Linda McKinney is a myrmecologist, a scientist who studies the social structure of ants. Her academic career has left her entirely unprepared for the day her sophisticated research is conscripted by unknown forces to help run an unmannedΓÇöand thanks to her research, automatedΓÇödrone army. Odin is the secretive Special Ops soldier with a unique insight into the faceless enemy who has begun to attack the American homeland with drones programmed to seek, identify, and execute targets without human intervention.

Together, McKinney and Odin must slow this advance long enough for the world to recognize its destructive power, because for thousands of years the ΓÇ£kill decisionΓÇ¥ during battle has remained in the hands of humansΓÇöand off-loading that responsibility to machines will bring unintended, possibly irreversible, consequences. But as forces even McKinney and Odin donΓÇÖt understand begin to gather, and death rains down from above, it may already be too late to save humankind from destruction at the hands of our own technology.
