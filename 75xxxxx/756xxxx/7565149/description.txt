*****

20 years ago we could see quality movies on free television, but those days are gone forever. 

I decided to help because I was helped. Therefore I make this available for those who really love cinema as an art but, like me, can┬┤t acess and/or specially afford some titles outside US, England, France... 

I also strongly recommend a visit to http://thepiratebay.se/user/Auge/ 

I will try seed for 10 days, so please help and do your part to keep this alive.
