This time Max and Stacy discuss the fact that we're all cows eating candy during the global liquidity drought and yet Central Bank 'farmers' can't see the ill-effects because the stock markets are at four year highs. 

In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Dmitry Orlov about 2013: revolutionary travel advisories, economic and supply chain collapse and food stamp lines at Walmart.
