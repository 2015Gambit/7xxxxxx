,MISFIT---420,2012-08-24T02:31Z,Is the the version the will WORK with Windows 8? There is a few so called final releases and NONE are legit you can't even install them on Windows 8.
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-08-24T02:38Z,Yes it will work on windows 8 and this is the version which has been released in US http://usa.kaspersky.com/
,MISFIT---420,2012-08-24T02:59Z,yes YES indeed this is the real deal ! VERY nice upload. To all the people getting this for Windows 8 there is 3 or so other torrents just like this claiming the final release they are false I wasted 2 hours of my time downloading them only for Win 8 to tell me it is not supported. This one will install it is legit a MUST have for 8.

,jactor299,2012-08-24T08:45Z,"Downloaded, installed, turned internet off. entered 2222-2222-2222-222u as key but didn't get ""next"" option activated, still see only ""cancel"" option.

Where did i go wrong? can some1 help please???"
,jactor299,2012-08-24T09:05Z,"Finally succeeded had to put 22222-22222-22222-2222u as key (in blocks of 5 not 4). But validity is only 21 days, is that correct?? Is this a trial version???"
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-08-24T09:07Z,@jactor299: read agian it says no need to turnoff net.and if u want to activate it offline then use 1111-1111-1111-111x
,RipperDaVe,2012-08-24T13:31Z,"Works great but I'm also getting just a trial version - is that all this is, and if so are you putting out full version keys @ some point? Thanks"
,comahmedtito,2012-08-24T13:54Z,it's RC Not final .. lol
,MISFIT---420,2012-08-24T14:32Z,to all that are having issues with activation (less than 30 days) you gotta go thru the keys till you find the right one. If using windows 8 use key #1 activated for 215 days. On windows 7 use key #24 activated for 215 days. If you istall other key and got a 20 or so day activation simply delete the key (lil red x beside the key after activated) and try another till you get activated. Example key #1 only gave me 21 days on win 7 but gave me 215 on 8. And YES this is FINAL if it was not I could not have installed it on Windows 8 !
,digimike50,2012-08-25T22:40Z,"Thanks uploader (Gh0stNet) - great! Works perfectly on W8/64. Thanks also (again) to:Gh0stNet, Jactor299 and MISFIT---420. You do NOT need to disconnect the internet; enter the number 22222-22222-22222-2222U and, for W8, use the first key, and get 215 days! Now, just how long it will be before the key is blacklisted, who can tell? But some day, unlike the movie NOT too far, far away, when you reboot, it will be!
By then, I hope that we have some more genius's who can provide more keys!
Thanks again ... cheers!"
,jewcifur,2012-09-01T15:11Z,"working awesome so far, FYI the second key will activate for 268 days.

i updated once, immediately after install.
was wondering if i will be able to update again in, lets say 3 months, without losing registration."
,jewcifur,2012-09-01T15:15Z,"also, i turned off internet, i didnt use any serials (the 2222-2222-etc. or the 1's) when installing.
not sure what i did, but it wasnt necessary.

and thank you Gh0stNet!"
,MISFIT---420,2012-09-01T19:30Z,i updade daily
,jewcifur,2012-09-02T18:26Z,"awesome. still only gonna update like once a month. and i was wrong, the second key activates for 259 days not 268.... maybe that was the third key. /shrug"
,MISFIT---420,2012-09-03T14:38Z,why update every month ? you still gonna ge all updates you missed its pointless not to mention you have a much greater risk of infection. daily or monthly if they find out its pirated you still will be hit.
,Mingfang47,2012-09-10T10:39Z,"Thanks to the uploader, and all who comment & clarify here.
Regarding the KEYS, choose key 1 and key 2 for longer expire date. Other keys were expired or less than 70 days or not compitible. I'm using Win7 32bit."
,jensrr,2012-09-12T15:17Z,"expiration date is 03-27-2013
only 196days remaining.. 
not that much days of activation but thanks"
,MISFIT---420,2012-09-14T18:27Z,@ jensrr dude its over half a fucking year. go buy the goddamn thing you worthless piece of shit
,dexamp60,2012-09-16T22:43Z,"update once a week so it doesnt get blacklisted, thnx ur awesome."
