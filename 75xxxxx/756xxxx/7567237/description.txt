Weeks before Republican Paul Ryan was selected to run for vice president, Sister Simone Campbell ΓÇö who heads NETWORK, a Catholic policy and lobbying group ΓÇö hit the road to protest the so-called ΓÇ£Ryan budgetΓÇ¥ recently passed by the House of Representatives. She and some of her sister nuns rolled across the heartland on a bus trip designed to arouse public concern over what the Ryan plan would mean for social services in America, especially its slashing of programs for the poor. Sister Simone says his budget is inconsistent with Catholic social teaching. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops agrees.

But other Catholics say Sister Simone and the nuns have crossed a line. Robert Royal, editor in chief of The Catholic Thing and founder of the Faith & Reason Institute, believes that issues of economic inequality are being oversimplified. Royal says the focus should be on creating a more dynamic economy for all.

In this episode, watch our field report from producers who rode along on the ΓÇÿNuns on the BusΓÇÖ tour, then join a passionate, candid discussion about faith and economics with Sister Simone and Royal.
