FIX NOTES

One of our dlls made it a little complex for users to get the game to
run, but never the less, many found out, how to get it running, as our
crack works just fine.

Here you have a non-complex edition, that should solve all complexness
and make it pleasent to get running.

Remember to block game in firewall and we do protect our work, so be
sure to add our crack to the allowed section in your antivirus program,
or else you might have some issues. There is not going to be another
way!
