,TheNemmy,2012-08-23T23:40Z,-1
,mindgrave,2012-08-23T23:58Z,"Working for me. Before all i would get was the intro and 8 bit sound. Now it starts up with NO PROBLEMS.

Remember you have to make sure ur AV didnt take out the cracked files. Make sure u set the AV to exclude the folder that the cracked files are in ( the main directory) And also make sure that ur AV is BLOCKING internet connection to the main HMSC.exe

Good luck ."
,z0s,2012-08-24T00:04Z,The fix works great!!!! 
,nignug,2012-08-24T00:25Z,"If the fix didn't work try reinstalling the game. Works now for me. 

Can't wait for the full game to come out!"
,keithmadden,2012-08-24T00:25Z,working fine now thanks :D love you :D
,TheNemmy,2012-08-24T00:34Z,"The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142). Click OK to close the application.

Windows 8 RTM is the issue ?

I'll wait for hitman absolution itself. this is the first torrent on tpb where I've failed."

but at least don't have virus."
,CHAOS1972,2012-08-24T01:11Z,"[quote=SKIDROW]One of our dlls made it a little complex for users to get the game to run, but never the less, many found out, how to get it running, as our crack works just fine.

Here you have a non-complex edition, that should solve all complexness and make it pleasent to get running[/quote]

,Tanlic,2012-08-24T01:23Z,Nod 32 found win32/agent.nan.virus in the HMSC.exe file :0(
,iLuSiVe,2012-08-24T01:43Z,Honestly with all the bitching and QQ'n over this I dont even see why you waisted the time making a fix for it! They dont deserve (or appreciate) any of the work your doing for them and those of us that do would'nt have minded anywyays b ut its much appreciated!

,Tanlic,2012-08-24T01:59Z,"Even if you turn off Nod32 to install the minute you turn it on again it wants to delete the hmsc.exe file and it automatically quarantines the  hmsc_skr.dll	a variant of Win32/Packed.VMProtect.AAA trojan. Some anti viruses will delete/quarantine these without the user knowing and that's why the crack won't work

Maybe they are harmless I don't know but if they are the uploader should warn people and put proper install instructions up.......which makes him/them a fuckin wanker"
,CHAOS1972,2012-08-24T02:03Z,"Tried this with a fresh install & don't even get the stupid SKIDROW intro video....
Nothing.....
No Antivirus running at all!!!"
,tricky29,2012-08-24T02:04Z,"thanx m8, this works for me"
,nekroto,2012-08-24T02:27Z,Can't believe people still have problems. Just disable your av and set the exe and buddha.dll into the exception list.
,sigmas55,2012-08-24T04:15Z,"yeah guys; the fix did work with me, but i can't go over the first mission, i mean i play the first mission as well but then there is no such a ""continue"" botton or ""next mission"" or anything, there is only ""restart mission"" or ""main menu"" bottons and when i choose ""main menu"" and hit ""play sniper challenge"" which is the very 1st option; it gets me back to the first mission. i played it three times till now and nothing changed."
,nignug,2012-08-24T04:15Z,You scene noobs just never get it do you. A MAJORITY of game cracks are detected as virus' by most anti-virus programs. The only way to know this file is safe is by the fucking skull and bones by the uploader's name. To be safe never download games not uploaded by a trusted scener.
,TheNemmy,2012-08-24T11:01Z,"Read This :

ppl who are calling ppl noobs know this first :

we have uninstalled our antivirus and disabled firewall but the game still doesn't work !!!! even with this fix, also tried re-installing."
,Tanlic,2012-08-24T11:39Z,So we are in agreement.......Crucify him ? :0)
,zaeb,2012-08-24T12:39Z,its not a av motherfucking fucktards. it just doesnt work. pos stupid retarded cracking team.
,johnniebrasco1,2012-08-24T13:26Z,"For me this worked fine after installing steam, as lots of people have said in the comments. Install steam, update it. Then you can play, you don't need to log in. If you don't use it, uninstall when you are finished with the game. The crackers probably didn't encounter this problem as I'm sure they had it installed already. But i would think this is what this fix is for?"
,johnniebrasco1,2012-08-24T13:30Z,"Tanlic: Almost every cracked game works like that, and you will have false positives. You can exclude them in the AV, and if you don't know how to to that, then you are the wanker, not skidrow. You better learn some basic PC skills, and shut up. Solutions to the problems have been floating around in the comments to. read them, stop bitching."

,sigmas55,2012-08-24T14:51Z,"@johnniebrasco1: OMG,, is this true!!!! all these problems to play one level only, it didn't worth the download time and the cracking issues. i thought this will be many sniping levels that are not in the coming game""absolution"".. thnx for the clarification mate."
,welhim,2012-08-24T16:38Z,nothings happens

,sabot112,2012-08-25T21:48Z,"I have a fix for Win 8... the fix is; don't use that shit. If you are so stubborn you have to use a barely working OS, live with the fact a lot of software isn't going to run on it."
,phadeb,2012-08-26T13:58Z,"@sabot : softwares work fine on windows 8, its just hitman + spiderman, other games work fine as well including skidrow's :)"
,nandakis4,2012-08-28T04:34Z,"i am playing this game by applying crack .
