Not knowing when or if another scan will ever turn up I went ahead and ran it QUICKLY though a photo editor. Nothing too labor intensive, but it looks much better. Everything else looked great to begin with."

Most welcome. I've always wondered why Marvel has never returned to this world/property. It seemed like it had/has a lot of possibilities.

Also, funny you mentioned it, because I'm working on an Elfquest torrent right now. "
