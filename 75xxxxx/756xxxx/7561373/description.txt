Fire Glow is a premium live wallpaper using the latest Open GL technology to enhance your device look and feel. Fire is set with realistically crafted flames that burn in the center of your device while giving off an ambient colored glow on a fiber gradient background. Flames and ambient glow can be set to any color imaginable and many preference settings included so you can get the right look. As an added bonus you may also layer the Skull and Bones over the flames for one sweet looking tablet or phone. Runs on the latest devices, but also configured to look great on older models as well.
