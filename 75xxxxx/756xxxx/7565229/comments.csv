,Savre,2012-08-25T11:34Z,"Thanks skullhill for being a proper Pirate Bay user. 
"
,Savre,2012-08-25T11:34Z,OH AND scene4all. I no forget you guys. Thnx. 
,nutpn,2012-08-25T12:50Z,"Thankyou very much,wished we could find
 the Campaign"
,piranical,2012-08-25T13:32Z,"a little blurry but still good for cam v7a6.5. scene4all is one of the best uploaders on here and keeps em coming a mile a minute so i have much respect for him, but tbh Topsider's cam copy, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7563257/Bourne_Legacy_2012(camrip) is better imo. "
,2DIE,2012-08-25T14:31Z,Thanks for being straight up and putting CAM in the title instead of TS like every other idiot that gets a cam copy of something. 
,spifkitten99,2012-08-25T14:38Z,Source was compressed to hell at some point. The video quality is as if the file size was 10 times smaller.
,googaloop,2012-08-25T15:36Z,"@scene4all I do appreciate the effort, but...
Looking at the video, it looks like a lot of the distortion is coming from the encoding. If you have the original cam, I suggest you do a little research regarding the best ways to encode. Check out TPB forum where you can find some good advice. Finding the correct codecs and understanding all the settings can be overwhelming and its easy to make mistakes. 

If my analysis is incorrect, then I do apologize. I am not trying to be an asshole, just a sympathetic pirate..."
,vampzcore,2012-08-25T16:08Z,thanks!!

Time to download: 18m 43s
Max DL speed: 1125kb/s
Audio: 7 (tweaked a bit in VLC)
Video:6.5 (free cam...)
Movie: completely up to you. I heard this was the best 'Bourne' that didnt star Matt Damon ;)

The cam is probably better viewed on a smaller resolution but still watchable on a big ole LCD/LED etc. Overall cost on this sure makes up for the average quality.

PS- is there a way to get a Russian/Asian bride combo deal? I see the ads for each individually but really would like to bundle..."
,007jamesbond,2012-08-25T17:04Z,"Great Movie ! thanks to the uploader

Best Cam version out there
A-7

,piranical,2012-08-25T17:07Z,"it's a pity this one was compressed because it's a definitely a decent enough copy in its own right. i am not in a position to question uploaders like scene or files from ILLUMINATI (that, on the whole have been awesome), but with a file as anticipated as the bourne legacy, i would have thought it would be given the star treatment as far as encoding and specs r concerned. i look forward to what comes out soon. "
,piranical,2012-08-25T17:13Z,"@007jamesbond, sorry but you're wrong. anonymous aka topsider's is the best. there's enough dlders to vouch that his is legite so take the time to check that one out first. once u do the homework. hey, i did, i dlded both because i thought ILLUMINATI's had to be better, particularly from a green skull. i was wrong."
,nycmon,2012-08-25T19:05Z,"i would have to agree with piranical....
i was one of the first to d/l topsider's cam copy and it still is the best one out there....
good job on this upload though"
,abbfanboi,2012-08-25T20:13Z,Jeremy Jenner is the perfect guy for this movie. Hope they make 10 more of these.
,abbfanboi,2012-08-25T20:13Z,Renner* lol
,culturas,2012-08-25T20:16Z,pretty bad copy
,rosivanl,2012-08-26T02:44Z,"It's missing the first five-ten minutes of the movie, (explanation of why Norton was brought in, the opening scene with Renner in the mountains retrieving the mail tube) but the rest is all there. Sound's good, though. "

,martinThomas,2012-08-27T05:15Z,"I registered to say thank you.  been coming here for a few years.  I take more than i give and haven't paid for a movie in quite a while

of all the commnets I've read, from thankers to haters.  One stands out above all the rest:

Someone found a way to achieve near 1080 blu-ray quality compressed to just 1.4 gigs.

Yet someone found a way to complain.
Seems he, let me qoute ""I just like a larger file size."""

Watchable...If not get another computer trolls"
,2kevlane,2012-08-27T16:20Z,"I rarely comment beyond the quality and I have not DL'd nor have I seen this.  However, I wanted to try and explain to all of you that are illiterate that if it doesn't say 'DVD' in the title, it's not from a 'DVD'.  In this case it actually says 'CAM' right in the title of the torrent.  For example user 'f20cs13' b*tched like a baby after the fact that this was a CAM version ...  insulting 'ILLUMINATI' in the process.  If you cannot read, please ask someone to teach you.  If you can read, your an idiot.  Godspeed."

,shootersebby,2012-08-31T10:35Z,"I request for your kind attention to this:
""THANKS ANYWAY"" is so rude, compared to ""THANK YOU NONETHELESS"".

Not in CAPS, of course. Please say ""Unwatchable, but thank you nonetheless"" instead. Peace starts with us as individuals."
