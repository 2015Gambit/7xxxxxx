,battlecommander,2012-08-25T02:48Z,newstar should be banned child porn
,Capt.Klaa,2012-08-25T03:53Z,"Child porn? Then lets arrest everyone who owns a copy of "" American Beauty"". Thora Burch was 16 when she did the topless scene. Or any one who has Blue Lagoon, Brooke Shields was 15 when she did that and 11 in Pretty Baby. BTW you can buy all those movies at WalMart. 

The only reason this gets call "" Child Porn"" is because the US Government can not collect any money from it."
,megodtoo,2012-08-25T05:28Z,"battlecommander, they are all fully clothed. I fail to see why you call this child porn. maybe you are seeing something that others don't. Thanks goes to the poster"
,battlecommander,2012-08-25T05:42Z,"if you had a daughter that is 13 years old would you like pedos stare at her in her underwear, i think not. little girls in sexy poses wearing underwear is illegal look it up"

,Who-He-iZ,2012-08-26T09:49Z,"Capt.Klaa is absolutely right: ""The only reason this gets call ""Child Porn"" is because the US Government can not collect any money from it.""
Yes, that's the only reason why Russian/Ukranian/Eastern European NN or NoNude model sites are not liked by them.
11 yo Brooke Shields is a fully naked child prostitute in Pretty Baby. And just today i bought on DVD this movie: Angel (1984) :
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086896/
where a 15yo girl is a school girl on daytime and a hooker on nighttime. The US Government makes money with these releases, just to name a few.
And, NO, these pics are not any child porn, and should therefore NOT be banned at all."
