,xenoFLASH,2012-08-25T19:34Z,any chance of the rest of the issues to appear?
,RubrumPopulus,2012-08-25T21:50Z,"@xenoFLASH:  ummm. You did read the description right?  Where I said the book went on hiatus and they haven't published any new issues in years...?  
So I guess only Warren Ellis could answer your question :D"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-25T23:19Z,"I'm not 100% positive, but I think the remaining issues of this book might have been part of the ""Great Warren Ellis Computer Crash"". I seem to remember him saying once at White Chapel that there might be more issues one day. But who knows, really? "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-25T23:20Z,"Ha! Funny. I clearly didn't read your description, either.

But yeah, I remember him saying there might be more of it... some day..."
,RubrumPopulus,2012-08-25T23:55Z,"@LeonardTSpock:  Yep. Can't wait for more.  They actually gave some pretty firm plans, but just no timeframe for those plans lol.   Image and Ellis have agreed to complete the series at 15 issues, but they will not start soliciting new issues, until Ellis has written them all (to avoid the same thing again lol).  Last I heard 10 was written and being drawn, and 11 was being written.  But that was months ago.  So they could be farther along now."

Sorry."
