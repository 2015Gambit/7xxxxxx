,MISFIT---420,2012-08-26T00:30Z,ok its like this no there is NOT a virus in this package... HOWEVER i installed this on 3 machines and all 3 ended up getting the SAME worm within 10 minutes of each other. maybe this dude knows his shit and this program directs you to his server and gives you the worm ? Im not sure how he does it but its funny all 3 machines got the same worm like that 10mins after installing. USE CAUTION
,micriches,2012-08-26T16:34Z,MISFIT---420  its because You are Using the same AV on three PCs. nd it is a false positive if You dont know-    If You think im really doing tht server virus injection then You should try to disconnect from the internet and install the packaage again then SEE hw wrong You are-
