The Betrayal is a story about Kobuse Takuma (Raizô Ichikawa in one of this best roles), a samurai, who has to take the blame of a crime he didn't commit to save his clan. For this he's forced leave his clan and his fiance under unfortunate stars. Beyond its fairly simple yet effective premise The Betrayal can be described as a companion piece to Masaki Kobayashi's masterful Seppuku (Harakiri, 1962). Both films highlight the hypocrisy and hollowness of the samurai code. While Seppuku (which I happen to consider the best Japanese film to date) is a surprisingly modern drama in its style and how it handles its subject matter, The Betrayal is a gripping revenge story - much more common to the whole chambara genre. However The Betrayal runs almost like an ancient Greek tragedy but in a Tokugawa era setting where the mythical samurai code hides the social injustice that's governed by the caste system.
