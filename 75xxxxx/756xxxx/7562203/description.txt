Version: 1.3.2
Cracked By: TeamExtreme
About: This is a repack of their version 1.2.5. I have not been able to find an update for their version since then, so I made my own. This is a fully working 1.3.2 Version with the Server File included (for hosting your own games). 


Install Instructions:

1. Extract Contents
2. Place .minecraft folder in: users/[username]/appdata/roaming/
2a. You may need to turn on "Show Hidden Files and Folders" in Windows Control Panel
3. Place the "Server" folder anywhere you please
4. Extract SMP Tools and place where you please.
5. Run Minecraft and Enjoy!!

Server Notes:

This is the updated 1.3.2 Server. Just run the .jar included in the Server folder to initiate the server. If you are playing on a non-legit copy of Minecraft make sure you edit the server.properties file and change onlinemode to "false" instead of "true".

Minecraft SMP Tools + Recipe Book

This is a bonus application that I find very useful and I hope everyone else does to. There is a proper description included in the folder, as well as video link to see it in action. It basically allows you to run Server Commands in minecraft with the click of a button, plus it includes a recipe book!
