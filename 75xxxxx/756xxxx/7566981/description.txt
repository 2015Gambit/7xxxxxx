The Ed Show; August 24, 2012.

 Move over Donald Trump.  Mitt Romney has blown the dog-whistle of right-wing hatred with a birther joke on the stump. 

"Right on, right on, right on" said Rush Limbaugh.

Ed asked Congressman Chaka Fattah (D-PA-02) if it a joke or a slip of the tongue.

Then, Michael Eric Dyson (Professor of Sociology at Georgetown University and author of "Can You Hear Me Now?") and  Richard Wolffe (MSNBC Political Analyst) examined Romney's political gamble.

Mitt Romney told the truth about big business, but continued to lie about President Obama's attitude towards small businesses.  E.J. Dionne (Senior Fellow at The Brookings Institution and Washington Post columnist) weighed in on that.

An avalanche of dirty money is pouring into Ohio to take out Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). 
Brown told Ed how Todd Akin, Medicare and voter suppression are moving the polls in the Buckeye State.

And in the Big Finish, Spike Lee (director of the new movie released today, "Red Hook Summer,") spoke out about voter ID laws and the impact on African-American communities.
