,NYTDDS,2012-08-26T04:28Z,"Broken AVI file. Not worth downloading, does not seek right, garbles whole picture."
,Zanteater,2012-08-26T19:03Z,"@NYTDDS:

I remember my first day on here too.

First of all kids, always use VLC media player, even if your download is a broken file, your computer (if purchased in the last 10 years) will automatically fix it [in VLC] and the process takes all of 10 seconds, and completely fixes it."
,NYTDDS,2012-08-26T19:33Z,"Now did I say you were a fake person? no :P did I say the file was fake? no :P

I just said it was broken AVI. I spent 4 hours downloading off of extrabit and got a fully working AVI file. Tell me why you couldn't get a fully working on either, and I wont complaing about uploading bad torrents =)"
,NYTDDS,2012-08-26T19:34Z,bad keyboard membrane FTL!
,NYTDDS,2012-08-26T19:51Z,"Also, it doesn't fix burning it to a dvd does it......


Cause if it does, then great! If it doesn't you can understand WHY (emphasis on why :P) I don't care to download something that doesn't work."
,NYTDDS,2012-08-26T20:01Z,"about VLC player fully fixing it.... yeah... only in VLC player.... every other player, oh say an xbox 360, ummmm a ps3, a nintendo DS with the right mod...

OMG you downloaded the file from RLSlog lol, so did I. I've been around long enough on there AND here to know when a file is fake, and when a file is real. So While I can totally agree it's not your fault. I can totally say you should have just found a better file with better integrity. 

But thanks for the subs =) Very much. and good luck in your future endeavors."
,Zanteater,2012-08-26T20:59Z,"@NYTDDS:

The file is obviously not fake my dear child. Fake torrents dont carry seeds like this one.

You are a simpleton and a dolt, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop showing everyone how incompetent you are at even the simplest of internet tasks.

I uploaded this because there just aren't/weren't any torrents at the time.

Deal with it nerd, this shit works for 99% of downloaders, and not for noobs like you.

Have fun with your DS (with the right mods looollolollolo cant wait for summer to be over)"
,Zanteater,2012-08-26T21:07Z,"There has been over 100GB uploaded by me on this torrent so far, lets do some basic math here, which may prove problematic for NYTDDS.

668.47MB goes into 100GB how many times?

Only one rude little child made a comment on how 'fake' and 'broken' it is...

That means...literally everyone but you eventually figured out how to play this movie.

IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT NYTDDS:
(He goes to ALL the torrent and bitches about their 'broken' status.) He in fact simply does not know how to operate a computer like the rest of us.

Do us all a favor and GO AWAY, or delete your account please.

Thank you in advance, please please please leave me the f*ck alone you wussy sissy prick."
,NYTDDS,2012-08-27T22:57Z,"Wow... I wasn't being rude. I was being nice. But whatever, 

My first comment was truthful, I'm sorry the truth hurt, but I didn't mean it to.

As for making pot shots at me personally. 

Dude, Im not a kid, I'm older than u probably, and I've been around TPB longer probably.



So... do us all a favor in the pirate community, and not be a total dick.

I was trying to be helpful to other users telling them this file is corrupted and buffers when you play it.

YES IT IS CORRUPTED. NO ITS NOT FAKE. How many times do I have to say that?"
,NYTDDS,2012-08-27T22:58Z,"get a clue. this file is corrupted. go download scenebalences file, cause this is NOT worth the download everyone."
,D0gmeat,2012-08-28T01:00Z,"Broken for me too.

This one is working:

,Zanteater,2012-08-28T01:09Z,"Your a noob because fixing the file is as easy as opening a wet cardboard box, and for some reason you just can't figure out how.

Delete your account and leave me alone."
,NYTDDS,2012-08-29T19:49Z,"LAWLS, UR STILLL GOING.


Get a clue, don't upload buffering files here, it's not liked. No one likes it. They DEAL with it, but they dont prefer or like it.

Get a clue. Delete your account and then fuck off and die. We dont need idiots in the P2P scene, creating large arguments, when i was trying to be helpful to everyone else because you uploaded a BAD file.

God are you fucking egotistical or what. Grow a pair of balls, and a few more braincells, then try another torrent. Until then just fuck right on off with your petty arguing and bullshit."
,Zanteater,2012-08-30T23:34Z,"NYTDDS:

Your still a moron, youve never left a constructive comment. I didn't start an argument, I defended myself as the sole uploader of this at the time.

The other torrent of this is the same one just with the 2 second fix for the file you could never figure out.

Youve proven yourself an idiot and a noob so AGAIN, fuck straight off and quit trying to look like a bad ass by bullying the little guy.

You are an idiot and please go the fuck away again."
,NYTDDS,2012-09-04T22:00Z,"@Zaneater

You're not Your."
,NYTDDS,2012-09-04T22:02Z,"all my comments have been constructive. you are just too bias to your own torrent to understand. Stop thinking about yourself, or your torrent. Think about other people."
