
DESCRIPTION:
Doom 3 : 
___________________________________________________________________________________

Distinguishing itself from previous titles, the third game in the series focuses more on an engrossing single player experience.
In addition to its frenzied first-person shooter action, it also scares the wits out of players as they tremble down dark corridors filled with gruesome zombies and monsters ready to attack from the shadows. 
Players have to switch between their weapons and their flash light to survive the horror that Hell has unleashed on Mars. 
DOOM 3 features realistic physics, 6-channel surround-sound, and real-time dynamic lighting and shadows that create an environment of ever-changing fear and uncertainty. 
Compete in vicious multiplayer action where light, shadows, and a totally dynamic world can be used to your advantage or peril.

"Resurrection of Evil" expansion:
___________________________________________________________________________________

An expansion edition of the graphically immersive horror-shooter series. 
DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil continues the frightening and gripping single player experience of the blockbuster original. 
The title also features even more multiplayer action with support for up to eight players in all new maps. 
Through the discovery of a timeless and evil artifact you now hold the powers of Hell in your hands, and the demons have come to hunt you down and take it back. 
Following the events of DOOM 3 and featuring new locations, characters and weapons, including the return of the double-barreled shotgun, DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil expands the terrifying action that fans and critics have been raving about. 
The title requires the full retail version of DOOM 3.

Note from me:
This torrent is a repack of Synapse's Doom 3 + Resurrection of Evil release. 
Many people complained in torrent's comment section about how bad it is to install the game in DOS window. 
My release is 100 % working and clean install of Synapse's release. Additionally, I included Doom 3 Closed Captions mod, and created shortcuts for Doom 3 and it's expansions pack,collectively.
