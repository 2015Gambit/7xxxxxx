,evilmonkey99,2012-09-06T11:35Z,"i have almost 700 of these high def movies and most of them don't stretch to full screen. I think it is because most movies are widescreen so they have those black bars on top and bottom. If you try and stretch them full screen with some program, they end up looking like shit. I think it all comes down to how the movies were recorded by the movie creators. Thanks for this copy NLUPPER."
