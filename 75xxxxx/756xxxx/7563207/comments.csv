Whether you install it to a custom directory or allow it to install to the Program Files (x86) directory.

Now, I woke up like 5min ago, and I'm listening some Parkway Drive, and I just lunched TFOC and it worked.. o.O As I said, it's god damn Activision, they, as I remember, never made a game without some bugs.. Perhaps you try to install Visual C++ from game, or install some older Net Framework, or try crackfix.. I'm sorry if I'm cruel or something, my English is poor.. :)http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7568991/Transformers.Fall.of.Cybertron.Language.Selector.incl.Crackfix-S"
,Lerianis2,2012-08-26T13:31Z,"Tilta, it's not Activision here. It's Microsoft being dipshits and leaving something out of Windows 8 that is necessary for these games.

That said, I'm not surprised with the amount of changes in Windows 8 that something got left out.

C++ Redist is on my machine, installing earlier .net's is impossible because there is a 'protector' in Windows 8 to keep problems from happening.

Activision is just going to have to fix Microsoft's error after the RTM comes out for public use and make a patch.

Sleeping Dogs has the same issue."

Its totally unnecessary to do what you wrote .

I had problem with loading screen and fixed it by downloading ""Transformers Fall of Cybertron Language Selector incl Crackfix-SKIDROW"" .

No steam required ."
