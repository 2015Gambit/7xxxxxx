VINTAGE MUSIC VOL 1 & 2   (MCA MCAD 5777)

This is a very early CD collection of 1950s ΓÇ£oldiesΓÇ¥ first issued in 1986. Original master tapes from a variety of labels under MCAΓÇÖs control (ABC Paramount, Chess, Brunswick, Coral, etc) were re-mastered for this compilation by engineering wizard Steve Hoffman, whoΓÇÖd soon be working for DCC making gold audiophile CD reissues of classic albums.
