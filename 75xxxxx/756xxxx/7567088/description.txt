Features:

Playbooks Presentation ΓÇô NFL broadcasts are some of the most impressive in the world of sports, and that attention to detail is apparent in Madden NFL 13. From the moment players start the game and see the completely redesigned opening, to the 3-D booth showcasing new commentators Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, Madden NFL13 provides the most dynamic, authentic presentation yet. On the field, HDR and multi-vector lighting tracks the position of the sun after every play, and motion blur gives a true sense of speed. Also, donΓÇÖt forget those brand new Nike uniforms 
and gear, which debut in their full digital glory in Madden NFL 13.

Gameplay ΓÇô An enhanced passing system opens up the game like never before with changes to the way quarterbacks, receivers and defenders react to the ball. On top of all that the new Infinity Engine completely redefines how players interact in Madden NFL 13.

Offense: The new Total Control Passing mechanic lets players lead receivers into open space and put the ball exactly where they want it to go. Also, revamped passing trajectories, quarterback dropbacks, and play action improvements make airing out the ball more appealing than ever.

Defense: Defensive coverage AI has been completely rewritten thanks to the new read and react defensive AI. Conversely, defenders now disguise their coverage so users wonΓÇÖt know if the defense is in man or zone until the snap, creating a chess match between the offense and defense.

Infinity Engine ΓÇô The brand-new Infinity Engine brings physics-driven animation to the Madden NFL franchise, ensuring that no two plays every look or feel the same. Play outcomes are now unpredictable with factors such as mass, velocity and momentum considered into every play. Just because the tackle has started doesnΓÇÖt mean the action is over, and players can fight for every yard and scrap for every tackle.
