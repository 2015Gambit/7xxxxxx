[V],boobsman,2012-08-25T20:45Z,"@ vstream if that's your attitude why should i post the game in the first place??? i get nothing from uploading, it costs me endless amounts of money and other than a few comments i get no thanks!

You should seed because you've got the game for free and you want to help others to do the same, be grateful for what you now have otherwise what's the point in anyone posting torrents?"
,SteelerJ17,2012-08-25T20:47Z,I'll be seeding this after I get it. No worries! :)

,lorddarthdon,2012-08-25T21:44Z,"@death_giva seeing as you own a jailbroken PS3 and you dont know how it works? lol you dont need it then. trade it off to someone that does for a normal PS3. and by the way even if you did place this game into an external hard drive you couldn't play it anyway dumbass this is for the xbox360.

,myromm,2012-08-26T01:24Z,"i'm having a problem with this one, i've never had a problem with boobsman games, but this one is always freezing, i use a device to emulate the driver so it's not a burn problem. it may be the device. but anyway, anyone's having that problem?"
,lorddarthdon,2012-08-26T01:33Z,@myromm if your using an Xkey have you updated to the newest firmware? think its 1.23
,myromm,2012-08-26T02:02Z,"I have just updated and still freezing, can anyone confirm that are not having this problem with physical dvds? otherwise i will need to wait for an xkey firmware update or re-download this copy"
,lorddarthdon,2012-08-26T02:11Z,@myromm im running a Xkey also with zero problems you may want to format the micro sd card and re-dump your dvd key and reload everything

,SteelerJ17,2012-08-27T18:17Z,@punu05 I'm sure ABGX360 will verify the game tomorrow. Plus of what Smallz94 said. Upgrade to lt 3.0. Are you patching up XGD3 topology files w/ Xbox Backup Creator? If using IMG Burn verify the disc after burning. 
,punu05,2012-08-27T18:47Z,"@SteelerJ17 Yes... the reason for not upgrading is that i have some games like max payne and Sleeping dogs to finish before upgrading as they will not work once upgarded...

yes i am using backup creator... the disc is playable but after clicking play game it gives unsupported disc error...

abxg360 is veryfying everything but giving error in autofix...

one more thing once it gets added to abgx360 will it work???? should i repatch it with abgx360 then add apsector with backup creator then burn...??"

,SteelerJ17,2012-08-27T19:35Z,@punu05 Are you using Verbatim dl discs? They're the best in the market. Add the sector before running AGBX.

Thank you boobsman once again.

@videogamer23 
Man if you don't have iHas burner it is fine. As long as your current writer does write the dual layer disc its good.
I have burned many games (somewhere 35 so far ) all downloaded from boobsman posts for my xbox.

Write speed 2x
burned via imgBurn
Verified via ABGX360
Method Turncate
Layer Break
Disc Calculated: optimal
LT Version 3.0
Write Option Truncate ( it will prompt during burning )
