,FureeTutawk,2012-08-31T02:06Z,"Actually, they are BOTH fantastic. I saw the foreign flick first and was thrilled with it, looked up info about it, found out an American version was made which people with their noses in the air were poo-pooing so I looked it up, too, watched it and BAM I was thrilled again! They are BOTH FANTASTIC for different reasons, don't let anyone who thinks only foreign films with subtitles in HQ wide screen are worth watching, I'm 53 years old been around movies since I was knee high to a grasshopper. You WILL enjoy this version and it will be better than the other version in many ways, while vice versa with the foreign flick. Get them both."
