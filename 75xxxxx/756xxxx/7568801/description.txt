Sunshine (Ralph Fiennes) [1999]

The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations,
rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling
Austro-Hungarian Empire. The patriarch becomes a prominent judge but is torn
when his government sanctions anti-Jewish persecutions. His son converts to
Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but
is caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, the grandson, after surviving war,
revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate allegiance must be
to himself and his heritage.
