Beacons' is set to be a big moment for Two Door Cinema Club. Musically, it finds the band broadening out but retaining the sound, the essential feeling which made debut album 'Tourist History' such a success.

Produced by Jacknife Lee, it's an album which is big in almost every sense of the word. Out on September 3rd, it finds Two Door Cinema Club using the experience built up by almost two years of continual touring.
