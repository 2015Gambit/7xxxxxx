,koooor,2012-08-25T18:28Z,why do people keep saying you need special burners thats bullshit you just need a normal dual layer burner and some decent DVD+R DL disc if you dont know how 2 burn just google it its simple so stop saying these games dont work when they all work perfectly well why whould boobsman even bother uploading a game if it dont work are u lot abit thick
[V],boobsman,2012-08-25T20:50Z,"@ koooor most games will burn and play fine from a  normal dual layer burner, though some do need an ihas burner just to work (such as dragons dogma) and all xgd3 games must be burner with an ihas if you intend to play online."
,MonteZionBrasil,2012-08-26T06:42Z,lt 3.0 ?
[V],boobsman,2012-08-27T19:47Z,@ MonteZionBrasil this is an xgd2 iso so will work with older firmware but not older than LT1.9

,fmj77,2012-09-14T10:46Z,Don't waste your time with this lousy game. Some levels won't let you advance even after you have completed all the objectives and you have to keep restarting checkpoints. Stupid fucking piece of shit game from a fucking retard developer.
