Also forget playing with with KB/M, support for that is just horrible, kinda unplayable imo. Make sure you have a controller to play this game. A Xbox 360 controller is perfect for this. But yeah if you play with KB/M , you will actually see your mouse cursor move all over the place, there are ways to hide it but its a hassle, and the movement just sucks, ontop of that the Xbox 360 controller icons never go away even if you are using KB/M. Definitely needs controller.

So yeah , Resolution Fix + Use Controller = Awesome. Wont even feel like a bad port anymore."
,mek01,2012-08-24T13:53Z,"So to inform everyone:
The games runs fine and has 30FPS cap as everyone should know by now. Saves are working.

Playing with KeyB+Mouse is horrible, the pointer is kept on the screen, the instructions are with the Xbox controller icons, so it's confusing. Controller is highly recommended.

The locked resolution makes the game looks like crap at higher resolutions, so using the ""DSfix"" made by the user Durante from the NeoGAF forums is a MUST (It's currently in the 0.2 version ""DSfix 0.2""). Using that Mod makes it look gorgeous, just look up the internet for some screen shots, or even better, test it yourself, you won't believe the difference. 

That to tell some of the technical part, since everyone already knows that the game itself it's amazing."
,skareo,2012-08-24T14:27Z,"Unless you are planning on downloading a console game to play on your PC, skip this turd. Pretty much requires a shitty console controller just to play it. It's a trash game that was design for console peasants. Avoid like the plague!"
,noekk,2012-08-24T14:34Z,"Thanks mek91. The game has a fixed resolution ? It's 2012, not 1990, wtf is that ?!?

Use ""PrivateFirewall"" from here:

It can be somewhat complex, but it is much better than the next best, Comodo Firewall, since Comodo calls home all day every day and cannot be stopped from doing this, not to mention they actively deny it is doing so despite many people logging outbound packets from the firewall to Comodo servers while they are not even doing anything online."

G4WL has nothing to do with it because you can't start up an offline account without having the game installed and if the game won't install due to the serial issue some of us are having you never reach that point. I know how to create an offline profile and have done so for tons of other games. That's not the issue.

I didn't download this game, so it might be something to do with the game itself, but make sure your 'wired' xbox controller isn't actually wireless, and you're using the charger cable to plug it in to your PC. Your computer recognizes it as a charger and nothing more, and I've heard that you can't use a controller if it is connected by the charger cable. Just a thought :)"

,MisterBlake,2012-08-28T07:11Z,"SOLUTION for XBOX 360 Controller Issue. 
(Also internal resolution fix info) 

Hello, everyone! 

If you are having an issue simply plugging in and playing this port with your Xbox 360 controller due to wonky controls, please read this. 

1. Go to your Device Manager 
(Control Panel > Device Manager) 

2. Extend the 'Human Interface Devices' collumn and locate 'HID-compliant game controller' and disable it. 

3. Launch the game and play. 

As for the graphics fix: search for Durante's internal rendering resolution fix (DSfix).

Download the latest version and follow the instructions provided."

You will experience the rare fps problems but much less than in the console version. If I had easy access to dollars I would definitely buy this game for the multiplayer. To install I used the 1111... serial and that was it. Follow instructions, use a controller and dsfix and you will have a great time with Dark Souls."

After playing for several hours, it's very legit. I'm actually buying the game now to get access to the online stuff, which is the best part of the game. If you haven't played it before, I would buy it once you get it working because the online capabilities are nuts, and key to the experience.
