ΓÇ£How do the oceans work?ΓÇ¥ To help you find the answers, Trujillo and Thurman present in-depth discussions of oceanographic concepts and demystify the science even for non-science students. Their systems approach highlights the relationship between oceanographic phenomena and how those phenomena affect other Earth systems. Scientific information from geology, chemistry, physics, and biology combine to illustrate how each of these disciplines relates to the ocean.
