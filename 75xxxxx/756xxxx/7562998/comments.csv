I see that you got Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash. Any chance you can up After Effects, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, InDesign, etc?

(sorry I've never ""logged in"" so I couldn't see a way to PM you)"
,feedus,2012-08-24T09:09Z,"Oh sorry you have InDesign up. I'm really looking for After Effects in particular, but any of the others in the series would be great. Thanks again and sorry for any lack of... ya know... protocol. "
