If you have ever looked in this book hoping for a way to figure out just what is wrong with your client's back or neck or shoulder but did not find the answer, then you understand the need for a title to clarify just what is in here.
The new name, Differential Diagnosis for Physical Therapists: Screening for Referral, does not reflect a change in the content of the text so much as it reflects a better understanding of the screening process as the first step in making a diagnosis. Before implementing a plan of care the therapist must confirm (or rule out) the need for physical therapy intervention.

We must ask and answer these questions:
ΓÇó Is this an appropriate physical therapy referral?
ΓÇó Is there a problem that does not fall into one of the four categories of conditions outlined by the Guide?
ΓÇó Are there any red flag histories, red flag risk factors, or cluster of red
flag signs and/or symptoms?

This text provides students, physical therapist assistants, and physical therapy clinicians with a step-by-step approach to client evaluation that follows the standards for competency established by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) related to conducting a screening examination.
In fact, we present a screening model that can be used with each client.
By following these stepsΓÇöPast Medical History, Risk Factor Assessment, Clinical Presentation, Associated Signs and Symptoms, and Review of SystemsΓÇöthe therapist will avoid omitting any critical part of the screening process. With the physical therapy screening interview as a foundation for subjectively evaluating patients and clients, each organ system is reviewed with regard to the most common disorders encountered, particularly those that may mimic primary musculoskeletal problems.
