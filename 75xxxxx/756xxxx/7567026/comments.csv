,markefann,2012-08-26T22:13Z,"Love all your stuff, just great job! One favor, you had a Bear Garden album awhile back- one of the songs called ""Lounge"" was cut off in the middle. Any chance you'd upload that again complete?"
,dragonbandit314,2012-08-26T22:40Z,"Absolutely first class. Thank you.
Be well. T."
,r.trifun,2012-08-27T08:35Z,"Another fabulous compilation.
Thanks once again.
Cheers."
[V],80zforever,2012-08-29T06:52Z,"I think that's the bonus track which is not on the LP. The source is probably a 7'' single and could be tricky to locate in my collection. I won't promise you but if I find it, I'll upload the whole record.

dragonbandit314 and r.trifun thanks for taking the time and commenting on my uploads. "

,markefann,2012-08-30T18:14Z,Thanks so much! Just love that song when I'm driving. 
,digitalpress,2012-09-02T22:19Z,The Staff... FINALLY! I have this album but it's a crackle & popfest and my best efforts to clean it up weren't very successful. THANK YOU once again for bringing this (and many others) back from the dead!
