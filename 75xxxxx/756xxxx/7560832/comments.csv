Tonight,we have detected and saw a suspicious activity on this seed by Lab.ScanEye.pl...
See more details about them right here :
http://scaneye.net/
What does it mean...that's the question.
Therefore we might be forced again to change of strategy so.
We have started an investigation about them...
And anyway we don't like to see a such thing on our seeds .
Take care my friends,please ! 
To continue..."

take a look at this and you will discovering and see what they know about your ip and torrents you have seeded or downloaded...
Therefore we must change of strategy asap as they permanently tracked a lot of different ip on torrents...
Bad ! very bad news... :/ 
To all :enable your protocol encryption,please !
We decided to pass and switch to forced mode now and we strongly encourage you to do the same thing as well.
