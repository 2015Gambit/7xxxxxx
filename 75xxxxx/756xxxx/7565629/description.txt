    "Soldier of Love (Lay Down Your Arms)" is a 1962 song, written by Buzz Cason and Tony Moon[1], originally recorded by soul artist Arthur Alexander, appearing as a B-side to his single "Where Have You Been". The song was later covered by The Beatles during a 1963 session on the BBC, that is available on the album Live at the BBC;
   "One After 909" (sometimes titled The One After 909 in early recordings) is a song by The Beatles, written by John Lennon, with input from Paul McCartney (credited to LennonΓÇôMcCartney), and originally released in 1970 on the album "Let It Be". 
    The song was written as early as 1957, and is one of the first LennonΓÇôMcCartney compositions. The Beatles recorded a version of the song on 5 March 1963 during the same session that produced their third single, "From Me to You," and its B-side "Thank You Girl." They were unhappy with the result and that version was not released at the time. Various takes from the 5 March session, and an edit of them, were released in 1995 on the Anthology 1 compilation.
    In his 1980 Playboy interview, Lennon explained, "That was something I wrote when I was about seventeen. I lived at 9 Newcastle Road. I was born on the ninth of October, the ninth month . It's just a number that follows me around, but, numerologically, apparently I'm a number six or a three or something, but it's all part of nine." McCartney said, "It's not a great song but it's a great favourite of mine because it has great memories for me of John and I trying to write a bluesy freight-train song. There were a lot of those songs at the time, like 'Midnight Special', 'Freight Train', 'Rock Island Line', so this was the 'One After 909'; she didn't get the 909, she got the one after it."
