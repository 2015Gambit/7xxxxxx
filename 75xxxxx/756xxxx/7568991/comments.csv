,degusto,2012-08-26T07:51Z,"@LeoSky

If your a dumbfuck and can't install a game properly, that's on You! I personally never ever had any problems installing and playing TPB games as some tend to fuck up.

CONFIRMED WORKING GAME AND CRACK!
!Trust only Trusted torrents with skulls!"
,woshikevin,2012-08-26T09:44Z,"yup, the crack doesnt work on idiots and shits, it works only if you followed the simple steps and installed the game properly"
,Stefanovics,2012-08-26T11:22Z,"buddha.dll AGAIN?????
all cracks that contain buddha.dll are INFECTED!"
,Lerianis2,2012-08-26T12:56Z,"Guys, it could be that he is running this on Windows 8 Release Preview. This does NOT fix the issues on Windows 8 Release Preview that prevent you from playing the game.

I'm downloading the RTM right now so I will come back on and tell people if this works on the RTM of Windows 8.

If not, there is going to have to be a 'fix' released from either Microsoft or Activision and then the game cracked again."
,Lerianis2,2012-08-26T13:16Z,"Stevanovics, it's a FALSE POSITIVE!

The anti-virus companies have an agreement with the game companies that ANY crack for a game they mark as a 'virus' to try and scare people off from using it.

Also, on Windows 8 Release Preview, this still doesn't work properly.
It keeps on giving that c0000142 error."
,LeoSky,2012-08-27T00:05Z,I gave my user full control over that buddha.dll file and everything worked. Thanks
,GoldenSW,2012-08-27T13:51Z,Doesen't work for me. Same loading game problem.
,lazik,2012-08-27T14:24Z,i did everithing and still the antivirus deletes the buddha.dll file
,VektorX,2012-08-27T18:08Z,"Has anyone actually gotten this to work...? It sticks on the loading screen for me. There's no indication as to why the crack needed fixing in the first place, and there's not very many comments, so I can't even tell if it's me or the crack or what..."
,WaqasR,2012-08-28T14:27Z,"here is proper instructions
1 install game
2 add game into antivirus exclusions or disable antivirus
3 copy crack
4 install steam (just install no need to run)
5 enjoy

this method is also for hitman sniper challange"
,VektorX,2012-08-28T15:46Z,"Thank you WaqasR!
Yes, having Steam installed is the fix for getting stuck at the loading screen. I've dl'd literally hundreds of games and never had Steam installed. If something like that is required, it should definitely be listed in the nfo/install instructions. Just sayin'...
thx again WaqasR"
,xjun1or3,2012-08-29T15:55Z,don't work here in windows 8  i allowed buddha.dll and have steam installed 
,AWESUMNESS,2012-09-01T06:03Z,"Im getting an error saying: Application failed to start because nvtt.dll was not found???????
