Steven Gerrard is a hero to millions, not only as the inspirational captain of Liverpool FC, but as a key member of the England team. Here, for the first time, he tells the story of his lifelong obsession with football, in an honest and revealing book which captures the extraordinary camaraderie, the teeth-grinding tension and the high-octane thrills of the modern game as never before.

A relatively private figure, Steven has rarely spoken out in public. Now, his legions of fans are allowed an intimate glimpse of what makes their hero tick. He describes for the first time the torturous will-he-won't-he Chelsea rumors ΓÇô and his undying passion for Liverpool. We experience first-hand the highs of winning in Istanbul and elsewhere, as well as the lows of being parted from his much-loved family and friends. And, of course, the book contains a full blow-by-blow account of England's World Cup campaign in Germany 2006 and LiverpoolΓÇÖs 2006ΓÇô07 season.
