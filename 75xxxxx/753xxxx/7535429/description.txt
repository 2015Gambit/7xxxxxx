Here is a big pack of all the Standard Satanism books I currently have, this does not include the Satanic Bible, you can find that on my older uploads or wait till I upload the complete compendium of Bibles; which will hold around 30 different Satanic Bibles.

I currently have over 5gb of occult based books, and will be uploading them under their correct titles such as:
Vampirism,Sanguinarium,Satanism,Grimoires,Order of The Nine Angels, and tons others. Please seed this so I can upload more and so others can also grab these. These are all PDF formats if you require another format request it on our RG chan in irc on the efnet server just type  
/join #zombiRG 
in the type bar, or inbox me. Please make all requests for occult books only. 
If you have other beliefs against Satanism do not post them in feedback, If you don't like Satanism then why are you reading this in the first place?
