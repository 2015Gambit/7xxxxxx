,guiri_too,2012-08-16T16:20Z,"TvTeam, I just signed up at the torrenting site and I have a question. Being that the bay is very much monitored, would it be a little better (less risky) to download from to torrenting site?

Any good ways to protect myself from prying eyes so to speak?

Thanks for the upload by the way. I really appreciate your stuff and have been downloading (mostly tv shows) for awhile but not been able to say thanks because I couldn't figure out my login (which is now fixed thanks to someone from here).
