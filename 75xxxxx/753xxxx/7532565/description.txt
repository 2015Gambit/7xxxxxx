The Super Hero Squad Show - Season 1 - Complete
-----------------------------------------------

When the greatest heroes on the planet unite to face the world's greatest villains,
you get the biggest, most family-friendly Super Hero team-up in TV history...
Super Hero Squad. It's no small job protecting Super Hero Cityfrom the wild,
weird (and even wacky) villainy of VillainVille's infamous baddies... but
Iron Man, Wolverine, the Hulk, the Silver Surfer, Thor and the Falcon are
always up for the job. Shouting "Hero Up!" as they rush into battle,
the Squad must keep Dr.Doom's allies from gathering pieces of the Infinity Sword.
Otherwise, Doom will use the Sword to rule the universe! Luckily, the City is
filled with Marvel super hero guest-stars to help out in a pinch. These brave
heroes totally deliver the action - but with plenty of humor on the side.

Produced by Marvel Animation and Film Roman.
