* I will try to seed every night for as long as I am able to.

** I will not seed during the day as I work and do not want to leave my cpu running when I'm not around.

*** If you need a seed: Please post a comment and I will push it through as soon as I can.

**** This is only the second torrent I have posted, thank you for your patience."
