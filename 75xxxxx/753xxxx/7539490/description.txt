After stopping at the club and the candy shop it was time
for 50 Cent to move on.  His latest single, from his new
summer album Curtis, finds him having all sorts of fun at
an Amusement Park.  Produced by Dangerous LLC (Disco
Inferno) the beat is fun, playful and will have radio
station programmers salivating; however the streets and
loyal fans of G-Unit might not feel the same way.  So
let's get something straight: Its not okay for Ja Rule to
get a hottie R&B singer to sing the chorus, but 50 can
sing his own choruses?
