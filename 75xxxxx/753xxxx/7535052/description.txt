But less than half an hour passes, and you find yourself drawn into the story which sheds light on the sinister mysteries of the yards and backstreets ΓÇö the other side of this once quiet town. What secrets are hidden behind the friendly facades and shiny front doors? - Today you'll have to find that out. And how come you just agreed to a meeting with this mysterious lady?
