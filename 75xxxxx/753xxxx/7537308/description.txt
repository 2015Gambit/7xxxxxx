The small New England town of Blithe Hollow comes under siege by the undead. Only a misunderstood local boy named Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee), who has the ability to speak with the dead, is able to prevent the destruction of his town by a centuries-old witch's curse. He'll also have to take on ghosts, witches, zombies, and (worst of all) the moronic grown-ups. But this young ghoul whisperer may find his paranormal activities pushed to their otherworldly limits.
