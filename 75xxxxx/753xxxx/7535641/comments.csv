,danielcardoso.pt,2012-08-16T02:10Z,@Jacexx I'm doing the best I can :)
,skull-box,2012-08-16T03:06Z,why you post this torrent ?? no serial from msdn ? GRRRR.... no activation = BOULSHIT ! 
,PattyrRob,2012-08-16T05:09Z,Damn skull-box...you know how much an MSDN Subscription cost? And you want him to just give you a key. Get real. Go pay for your own account
,Nuclear_Mind,2012-08-16T05:25Z,i wanna install the core version (not the pro one) ... do i need to enter a key during installation ??

,danielcardoso.pt,2012-08-16T07:42Z,"You can get the keys for Windows 8 right here:

Professional WMC = RR3BN-3YY9P-9D7FC-7J4YF-QGJXW

It's true, MSDN keys are very expensive and now are even more limited in number of available keys :x

There's no really a ""good"" activation method right now, we just have to wait a little more :x 
I know speeds are low, but I have a lot of Windows 8 torrents and it's not up to me to decide who gets the best speeds :s"

,mortenmhp,2012-08-16T14:08Z,"asd-08 and everyone requesting the pro version:

This image provides both the core and the pro version. Installing using either of the keys provided by the uploader in an ealier comment will give you the corresponding version of windows 8(with the ability to change it later).

These are, as mentioned, the original MSDN images, and they can be installed using either the retail keys or the VL keys.(the keys posted are retail keys)

Neither key will successfully activate, so using the VL key will require you to find a working KMS-server(non online at this point) and using the retail keys will require you to activate windows later using an OEM-loader if one becomes available.(seemes unlikely at this time given the improved security of the OEM activation process).

For good measure here is the default keys allowing you to install this as both core and pro as well as retail and VL:

Retail
Core = FB4WR-32NVD-4RW79-XQFWH-CYQG3
Professional = XKY4K-2NRWR-8F6P2-448RF-CRYQH
