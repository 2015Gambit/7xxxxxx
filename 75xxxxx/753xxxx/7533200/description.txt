They love nothing better than sipping free-trade gourmet coffee, leafing through the Sunday New York Times, and listening to David Sedaris on NPR (ideally all at the same time). Apple products, indie music, food co-ops, and vintage T-shirts make them weak in the knees. 

They believe theyΓÇÖre unique, yet somehow theyΓÇÖre all exactly the same, talking about how they ΓÇ£getΓÇ¥ Sarah SilvermanΓÇÖs ΓÇ£subversiveΓÇ¥ comedy and Wes AndersonΓÇÖs ΓÇ£drollΓÇ¥ films.

ΓÇ£The best of a hilarious Web site: an uncannily accurate catalog of dead-on predilections. The Criterion Collection of classic films? Haircuts with bangs? Expensive fruit juice? ΓÇÿBlonde on BlondeΓÇÖ on the iPod? The author knows who reads The New Yorker and who wears plaid.ΓÇ¥
