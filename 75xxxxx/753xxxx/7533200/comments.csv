dude, get a clue- IT IS A BOOK OF SATIRE! What happened? Did you miss your meds this morning? 

And you had better take a long look at your excuse for English before you open your mouth. Old piece of advice for you: better to be silent and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.

Personally, I would like to see a sequel that pokes fun at the neocons, the reactionaries, and assorted Reich (right) leaning nabobs that goosestep down the street quoting BecK, Limbaugh, Boehner, Cantor, and the fools at Fartnews. Sorry, I meant to say Foxgnus..."

I'm not coming to the defence of bryentheartist, as his comment is DEPLORABLE and I'm fairly certain that there are people of many ethnicities  that would fit into his narrow-mined view(s).
(The point being that he is wrong to stereotype or define anyone based upon their race or skin color)
However, you are equally wrong and I'd urge you to take your own advise (to be silent lest you remove all doubt that you are a fool).  You lambaste bryentheartist (rightfully so) for his intolerance, and then assert your own (sterotypical hatred and intolerance) against those with whom you disagree with.  In one foul swoop, you describe those with conservative views (to quote you, ""assorted Reich (right) leaning"" naboobs that goosestep.."" yada, yada).  To paraphrase what you have said (and done) is to put forth the (wrongful) assertion that conservatives are Nazi's.  Your comments are therefore no less demeaning then those from bryentheartist, and equally aligned with fear mongering hate speech.  I have no doubt that you are BOTH fools and I'd like to see you both removed from this site for your comments."
