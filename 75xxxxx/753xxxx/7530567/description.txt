"Bad Teeth"

After their face-off with Kimura, 
Nick finds himself trying to come to 
grips with the return of his mother, 
Kelly Burkhardt. A trail of brutal 
murders unveils a foreign conspiracy 
to hunt down Nick, leading to several 
revelations about his past. 
Meanwhile, Juliette still lies in her 
mysteriously-induced coma as Rosalee 
and Monroe work tirelessly to bring 
her out of it safely. Elsewhere, Hank 
struggles with the shocking truths 
hes recently seen and Captain Renard 
deals with unexpected family issues 
when his estranged brother comes back 
into his life.
