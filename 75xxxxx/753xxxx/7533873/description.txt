Along with his Myron Bolitar series, Coben's stand-alone novels have cemented his reputation as a solid writer and a relentless plotter of high-octane entertainment. "I'm pretty sure it all worked out in the end, with no loose ends, but I wouldn't want to take a test," the Washington Post says of the "rococo plot" in Caught. The author's "family" novels address some important social issues and will resonate with anyone who has children, and the Internet angle is timely. With his latest effort--though, admittedly, a generally slower-paced effort with weaker characterization than in other novels--Coben delivers solid entertainment. Again.
