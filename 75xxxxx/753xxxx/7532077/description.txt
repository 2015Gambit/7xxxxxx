
[AIO] Software Pack 2012 [FEarBG]


::: What Is This ? :::

This is my own software package for reinstallation, that I use the last 5 years.

It is divided into two main types : Installation and Portable



::: Important :::

This torrent is an ISO image and you will need a program that can open it. I recommend "DAEMON Tools" but you can use "Virtual CloneDrive", "Alcohol 52%" and "UltraISO" as well. Even the most ordinary WinRAR will do the job, but will become much slower with it.




!!! ATTENTION !!!



This package contains many keygens, cracks and programs for registry tweaks that most antivirus will detect as malware. I personally receive around 30 fake malware alerts from the "Install" folder and some for the "Portable" folder with "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Pro". if you are so scared of them, you can delete them, but after that you will not be able to register these paid programs. As I said, antivirus detect keygens that are otherwise required to generate the registration key to unlock a program. I guarantee that all are harmless...


Anyway if you do not know what really is malicious program and the only thing you realize when you see antivirus alert is "OMG, OMG, VIRUS! I'M GONNA DIE" well .. I recommend you not download this torrent and save yourself the hassle. Probably you will not even be able to work with those programs...



!!! ATTENTION !!!




::: Folders :::



.:: Install ::.

Include all sort of programs, all are cracked or have working keygens. All must be installed to work.

As you can be seen in the link above, things are fairly arranged.


These are some pictures how the "Install" folder looks in Windows 7 :

.:: Portable ::.

99% of those programs are packaged by me. I use the method "TruPortable" (Portability + Stealth). You just need to run a single EXE and that's it. All necessary files are stored in a temporary folder that cleans itself when exiting the program. All paid programs are registered and you can use their full possibilities.
