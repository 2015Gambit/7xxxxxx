Masterpieces of the British Museum
The British Museum is home to some of the world's finest and broadest collections, ranging from prehistoric times to the present and from ancient and modern cultures around the globe. A series of six DVD's, dealing with six well-known (and perhaps slightly less well-known) masterpieces of the museum. These DVD's provide interesting background information on the history, manufacture, interpretation and discovery of the objects. Commentary is provided by the museum's experts. I found them excellent value for money, recommended for anyone with a love for history and a desire to learn just a bit more about these vanished civilizations.



5)  The Durer Rhinoceros 
Albrecht Durer's Rhinoceros is one of the most famous works in the British Museum collection. It is also one of the great images of European art--an image that has taken on an iconic status all its own. But what is so special about this simple woodcut of a lumbering, clumsy, Asian animal? Why has it influenced generations of artists, designers and craftsmen?

And to the person who had an audio problem with Part 4 , i tested it on both VLC & MPC And there are no problems at my end
