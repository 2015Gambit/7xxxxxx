THERE IS NO SKIDROW WEBSITE. Anything that comes from a site claiming to have anything to do with them is suspect at best. I would bet malware is likely.

Do drug cartels have websites? No? Why not? Skidrow would have the same exact reason to not have a site.

You cannot win this so long as some of us continue to warn off your would-be victims.

Since all of the torrents you post are from there, you should do this: Die in a fire."
