This collection mainly includes:

1) Works of C.G. Jung
2) Works of Jungian Analysts
3) Works related to C.G. Jung

There are 320+ titles (~6 GB). It's all sorted, though not perfectly. In some cases there are two or three versions of the same book in different format and/or quality.

"Works related to C.G. Jung" include works in which there is a fair mention of C.G. Jung and his thought, though there may be a few books which should not actually belong there.

There are also some unsorted academic papers on analytical psychology and Jung.

Please seed this torrent and re-upload it wherever you want (in full or in parts). Such profound knowledge should be available to all. So far, this is the most extensive and complete collection. Many files in this torrent are not available anywhere else on the Internet or are very hard to come by. Enjoy!

This collection of C.G. Jung's works was collected by a Jungian scholar. If you have more related material, please contact me. Thank you.

If you have a hard-copy of C.G. Jung's or related book that's not in this collection or is of better quality, you can either scan it or photograph it and share it.

If you are willing to pay for Jungian books, you can do so on www.innercitybooks.net. Many Inner City Books titles are available as eBooks on request (in PDF or ePUB format). There are other websites also.

The most valuable to the collection would be scans of the 20 volumes of Collected Works, as the current OCR versions are of poor quality.

---MORE C.G. JUNG MATERIAL---
-----------------------------

I am also in possession of ~280 HQ scans of works dating from the 15th to the 19th century on the subject of alchemy and related topics (magic, mysticism and Kabbalah), which are the foundation of the Works of C.G.Jung and come from his private collection. Most of them are in Latin, a lot in German, few in French and English. Total size: 42 GB. At the time, it was one of the most complete private collections in the field of alchemy.

I also have a sizable collection of audiobooks by Jungian authors (size: ~15 GB).

If there's any interest, and some contribution to the eBook collection, I could share them too. Contact me by e-mail: jungian.thoughts@gmail.com
