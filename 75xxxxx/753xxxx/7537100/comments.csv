I see tne is trying to educate people how to convert to xvids.. 

i have no problem with that.. if someone wants to convert his to xvids and share it save me doing them and data too"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T12:40Z,"but be warned.. mp4s dont always convert in sync regardless of what soft you use..

so you will need to learn a couple of tools to edit
the sync and always double check in random places before uploading.. I try to.. but sometimes I miss the odd one"
[T],trialNerror,2012-08-18T01:30Z,"it wasn't meant to have people share their conversion to AVI, it's so they can have an AVI without waiting on a middleman.

have you even tried MeGUI? in the past you have listed other freeware and i checked the mediainfo of one of your recent torrents and haven't seen anything that indicates MeGUI was used.

i've used that tutorial to test a bunch of mp4 samples and as long as the input is in sync then it will convert just fine without an A/V sync issue.

...just speaking from personal experience."
[V],psspss,2012-08-18T11:01Z,"some people dont want to convert.. some freak out when it gets to nerdy for them.. they just want the show in the format they want

yes I did try  meGUI but other soft still does it better 

but I would rather download others converts then share my converts or hace to convert it myself too :) less hassle less work less data
