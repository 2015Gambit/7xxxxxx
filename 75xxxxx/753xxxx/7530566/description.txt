WORKDONE:
 
First off the tag ...well was unsure what to tag it as,but came too this tagging after speaking to my russian Pal
 He told me the better source was ripped from the russian 1080p bluray and would explain the 24fps.
 
Anyway was kindly give a nice 720p rip and tweaked it some as i don't like the colouring and if its meant too be like that
 well fuck me sideways ....looks shite.
 So fixed it up too what i thought looked better ...ran a few other filters aswell ..
 Audio took ILLUMINATI's release as its better cam audio ...however the sync wouldnt fit over this rip so needed too resync it
 and also cleaned it some more in AA.
