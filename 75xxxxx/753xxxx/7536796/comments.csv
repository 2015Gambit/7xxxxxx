[H],GrooTheWanderer,2012-08-16T11:26Z,as you may have noticed you were not allowed to upload your torrent in the correct category.the reason is that url files are banned from the video category.unfortunately we cant do anything about it cause it would be unfair to others.if you want your files uploaded in the correct category then dont use url files in them.
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T11:41Z,"cant you just edit out the urls and leave it in tv?

i dont see urls in description"
[T],trialNerror,2012-08-16T11:46Z,yea i read that in the forum and will just upload stuff into Other instead of TV Shows so i can keep that url attached to the torrent.
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T11:49Z,ta
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T11:51Z,"i see now its a file url in the torrent itself

are you allowed urls in a text file though.. maybe a better way to do it"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T12:18Z,"
