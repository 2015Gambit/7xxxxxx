Oleg Romashin has got a long way already with a port of the open-platform OS to the Raspberry Pi. Firefox OS is scheduled to release some time in 2013; weΓÇÖre excited to see itΓÇÖll be an option for the Raspberry Pi, and itΓÇÖs fascinating watching work like this progress. In the video below youΓÇÖll see Gecko runtime doing its thing, along with some WebGL animations at 60fps.

OlegΓÇÖs a Principal Engineer at Nokia. HeΓÇÖs made a download of the work-in-progress port to Raspberry Pi available (this is a direct download link to the tarball; there isnΓÇÖt currently any other content on his site) if you want to join in the fun.
