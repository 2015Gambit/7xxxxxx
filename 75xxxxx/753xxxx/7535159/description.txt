While it isn't flawless, this easilly beats out most other oldies compilations of this nature. If you are a diehard oldies fan, you probably already own most of the good stuff. However, if you're a casual fan looking for some good party music, than this is a good collection. "Louie Louie", "Wolly Bully", and "Double Shot of My Baby's Love" are obvious picks, but still are great tunes. "Nobody But Me" and "Just Like Me" were unexpected but welcome additions.
