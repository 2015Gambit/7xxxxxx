XD I do have another request but it is a loooonng shot and I hate for you to go searching for it but it is a Apologetix Album called RARE NOT WELL DONE but it is the only album within modern hits that draws attention to my youth group, thanks again for PAX217 These guys are basically the 311 Christian Band!!!!"
,Weston0175,2012-08-16T05:11Z,"Could you do like, a mini Apologetix discography? I can't seem to find their music on any other torrent site other than this one."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-16T05:48Z,"Apologetix is an amazing band!  Very loyal to their mission, regardless of their concert attendance.  But they're hurting financially (it's always mentioned on their website) so my conscience suggests now might not be a good time to throw together a discography.  It's been something I've been struggling with for quite some time."
,PooterP551,2012-08-17T00:06Z,"TorrentTracts,
Hey thank you for the Marvin L Winans. Do you have his new album or the new Israel and New Breed or anything previous from them. Thanks "
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-17T00:36Z,"PooterP551, I was just asked about that new Marvin Winans release in my recent ""The Year In Christian Music (Bundle 30 of 30)"" thread.  I've been looking for it since it's release in June or so.  And I've not yet able to find it.  As for the Israel And New Breed album, it'll be included in my next 31st bundle which, Lord willing, will be posted here in the next few hours once my current 30th bundle finishes up."
,phil215,2012-08-22T22:06Z,"Hi! I would just like to say that I love your torrents, especially your ""Year in Christian Music"" bundles. I was wondering if you could upload the entire discography of The Swift, and if not the whole discography then at least their 1997 self-titled album? That would be wonderful! God bless!"
