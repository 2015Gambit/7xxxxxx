                   There was a commercial break injected there abruptly. I've noticed a
                   few other preseason games missing chunks like this on NFL Network also
                   so I'm assuming the NFL just doesn't care since it's just preseason.
                   Hopefully we're not missing too much but that's the way they're airing.
