NO or lack of comments I'll take as 
"You did not like the quality"
"You did not like the series"
"You have no manners"

I put a lot of effort into my TVrips
Unlike most posted TVrips my BBC rips have full endings
I don't like squashed credits with announcer talk-over
I fix this before posting, so mine are more like DVDrips than TVrips
