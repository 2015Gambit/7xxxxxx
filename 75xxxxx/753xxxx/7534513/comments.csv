,danwat1234,2012-08-22T01:16Z,"Works. Trial resetter resets it to 60 days each time, so have to go into Windows Safe-mode in order to run the trial resetter and reset to 60 days every 2 months. Pretty neat deal. I was able to log in to my identity safe account without any problems too so I could use the passwords stored on the Symantec cloud."
