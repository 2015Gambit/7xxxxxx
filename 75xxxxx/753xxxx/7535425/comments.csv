       This is for ""utorrent"" Client

1)Download and Install ""utorrent' Bittorrent Client.if you don't have it.Google it


2)After you have it installed come back to this page or my other ebook floods and click on""Get This Torrent"" this will start the ""utorrent"" app

3) Once ""utorrent"" starts there will be a smaller window that also appears.On the lower left hand corner of this small window will be a button with little arrows on it .Click on that button and the window will expand give it a little time to load all the books in the list once that is done you simply choose what books you want or don't want by ticking them off in the little box next to the title .Click okay when finished to begin download"
