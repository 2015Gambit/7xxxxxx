laterly

,sweetchuk,2012-08-15T11:51Z,"Thanks again for the best tNe - awesome work as always

pss, I know your little 'Noid universe has collapsed, but seriously, fuck off and pollute your own uploads. 
You think we're unaware of the situation? Clueless as well as a self-absorbed fucktard."
[V],psspss,2012-08-15T12:10Z,bum season finale already..
[T],trialNerror,2012-08-15T19:06Z,"i have a torrentfreak feed to the blog, so yes, i'm aware. they use to not give a crap about tv shows being shared but it appears that has been added to the list. maybe it's dvd rips of tv seasons and not tv rips? idk. times are getting more and more ""fooked"" up. oh well. first step to safety is to stop uploading to the popular sites the gov's are targeting such as TPB.

btw, chuk, you're not being so sweet. i've already said every bad thing possible to psspss, and i'm done; so no need to continue the rants.

besides, don't worry, chuk, when the p2p cappers stop uploading psspss won't have a lot to upload himself other than openminds.tv and whatever else he can snatch webrips.  but lucky for him scene doesn't have to mess with cyberlockers or p2p so he'll probably always have access to those to re-encode.  but in due time xvid will be a thing of the past and his services will be futile. in fact i bet he's kinda hoping that happens so he can have his internet back instead of using the monthly cap for everyone else. ;D"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T06:24Z,"well tne youre not being nice to me either much really with that comment at the end but I dont care.. im sure mpa love the fighting 

i know you rss it but maybe didnt read the comments which are obviously from the attackers calling them selves mpa and alike

wouldnt bother redoing this.. its fine even with the minor blurb at 21m in it.. other cappers have mp4 and xvids up now anyhow

just waiting for the other 2 paranormal shows from you now :) haunted this and that"
