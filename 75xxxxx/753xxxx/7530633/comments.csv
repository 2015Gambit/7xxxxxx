If you follow the instructions presented here (""Upgrade your firmware via iTunes to 5.1.1"") you'll end up with basedband upgraded to latest version, and lose the capability for good.  Please inform yourself first!

Samsung04, thank you for your valuable contribution here.  I would suggest you perform the proper warning in the header regarding this matter."
