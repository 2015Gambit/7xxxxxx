A quick little application I made to make editing the property file of a Minecraft server a little easier. By using this GUI to edit your property file, you never have to manually edit your text file again.

Instructions:
Step 1. Place "Minecraft Property File Editor.exe" in server folder
Step 2. Run "Minecraft Property File Editor.exe"
Step 3. Change settings as needed
Step 4. Click save button

Requirements:
- Windows PC
- Java 1.6.0_30 or above
- The need to play some multi-player Minecraft
