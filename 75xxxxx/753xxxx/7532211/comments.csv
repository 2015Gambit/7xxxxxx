Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 2 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
[V],psspss,2012-08-14T16:55Z,"nah I have to be careful what i source and share now and am pickers will have to wait.. im sure someone will up.. even  if its not xvid
i let afg do mythbusters today as well to save some data

i will concentrate on the less stuff about

at the moment meteorite men is what concentrating.. "
[V],psspss,2012-08-14T16:58Z,"im the only one with this file and just me seeding

one is left over as I switched vpns it will update no doubt soon..

and sometimes theres heaps of fake seeders.. so why need peerblock 1.1 install to stop them sharing fake data and slowing it down..

but make sure not to block me though LOL
which does happen.. "
[V],psspss,2012-08-14T17:00Z,"this is just one episode of s02 btw the way
i try to source rest next month.. will be slow process as data caps and costs are killer where Im at.. if only had 500gb huh liek some lucky people have also it takes me 1 hour ro make the xvid
and smaller share size all takes time and effort

you get the nice package at the end of it all
people dsont know how hard its to convert and source soem of these shows that for sure and hit and run dont help"
[V],psspss,2012-08-14T18:10Z,"

dam is the TPB being DDOS was locked out for good 30min and I hear on torrentfreak rutracker under attack"
,pacmauro,2012-08-16T02:05Z,"I'll be eagerly waiting for the rest of season 2....

I'll seed for a long time.

Many thanks!!"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T02:42Z,well seems no one keen for these only a handful seeding it still one wonders if sourcing any more is worth the cost
,pacmauro,2012-08-16T02:44Z,"psspss,

please do not let  the torrent die..."
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T08:34Z,"is everyone connecting to all trackers..

Im seeing 6 seeders incl myself.. but I can
onyl offer 4kb/s Ive already hit a ratio 2 for this

I see S01 went from 40 seeders down to 12 now!

make sure you can see seeders on the http of CCC tracker then you might get a boot"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T08:35Z,boost lol
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T08:37Z,"for someone reason prob cos TPB was playing up slow

KAT didnt auto index it.. perhaps a member there like to add it there as might help get more seeders in the long run

 im not a member there"
[V],psspss,2012-09-09T00:59Z,"

Is anyone still seeding this? as Im no longer

in fact i have more episodes to convert to xvid and share..

have all S03 now and all S02 except Ep5 which is missing "
,DPe,2012-09-11T13:36Z,Thank you so much! Have been desperate for these in Australia - Amazon won't even sell them to us
