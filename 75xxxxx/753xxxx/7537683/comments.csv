,thriorion,2012-09-15T06:57Z,"I'm having some trouble converting a few of the episodes, so far the first three, from the MKV format to anything else. I need to do this because my Xbox 360 Windows Media Center doesn't play MKV files. Any advice? Is it that I can only convert these files to a certain format, or is there some kind of encryption on them preventing conversion?"
