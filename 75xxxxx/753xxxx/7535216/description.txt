Scott's guests this time include:

History professor Alfred McCoy discusses how the Bush and Obama administrations have created a torture regime with "impunity at home, rendition abroad;" BushΓÇÖs policy change after the Iraq Abu Ghraib embarrassment, when Iraqis and Afghans took over torture duty and American soldiers kept their mouths shut about it; the pathology of impunity thatΓÇÖs endemic among high government officials; the torture debate between FBI agent Ali Soufan and Dick Cheney/CIA; and how universal jurisdiction could reign in US lawlessness.

Daniel Larison of The American Conservative discusses Republican vice presidential nominee Paul RyanΓÇÖs terrible foreign policy views; the bipartisan consensus on worldwide interventionism and American exceptionalism; and the prospects for war and peace in a Romney administration.

Law professor Marjorie Cohn discusses the legacy of Agent Orange on millions of Vietnamese civilians and American soldiers; the lawsuits and cleanup efforts still underway (or just beginning); and why you should pressure Congress to pass HR 2634 -- The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2011.

Chase Madar, author of The Passion of Bradley Manning, discusses ManningΓÇÖs defense lawyer David CoombsΓÇÖ motion to dismiss -- based on BradleyΓÇÖs mistreatment in pretrial custody; the brave psychiatrists at the Quantico brig who protested ManningΓÇÖs treatment, even though they were pressured by a general; and why similar treatment of other prisoners is all too "cruel and usual" in the US prison system.
