Release Notes:

So I bring you this release because Eclipse is no longer capping the show, our many thanks go out to you for your hard work!
I will try my best to cap the show, IΓÇÖm still working out a system where IΓÇÖll be encoding the show while it airs and uploading it too. IΓÇÖm hopeful it will work for todayΓÇÖs episodes.
I may not be the best person to actively cap the show because I donΓÇÖt have a paid feed for G4, so if someone else is willing to do it, go for it.
