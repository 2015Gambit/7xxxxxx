SAM Entry 2, electri-nah that joke is older than I am.
Here you are, the second solo album, by Erik "Jit" Iforgethislastname
I recommend track 13, Negastrife. Easily my fave.
Somehow I thought Solo Album Month would involve more.. well.. Albums.
Props to IakKereshna for being kind enough to validate my existence.
