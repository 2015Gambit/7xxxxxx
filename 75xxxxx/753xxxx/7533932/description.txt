the debut studio album by American recording artist Ja Rule, released through Murder Inc. Records. The album title alludes to the Latin phrase "veni, vidi, vici", meaning "I came, I saw, I conquered". The album was also the first release on Irv Gotti's Murder Inc. Records imprint. Before the end of 1999, the album had been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). This album, much like DMX's, It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, was a shift from Puff Daddy, Mase, and Bad Boy Records' "shiny suit era".
