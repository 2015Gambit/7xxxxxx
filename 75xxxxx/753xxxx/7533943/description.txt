The Amazing World of Gumball 
The Cartoon Network
Airs on Tuesday Nights from 7:00 to 7:30pm
Created by Ben Bocquelet.

The Amazing World of Gumball tells the story of an extra-
ordinary suburban family who just happen to live in an 
ordinary town. Dad is your regular 6'4" pink rabbit who 
stays home while Mom works in a rainbow factory. Their 
kids are pretty standard too- there's Gumball, a blue cat 
with a giant head, Anais, a 4-year-old genius bunny and 
Darwin, a pet goldfish who became part of the family when 
he sprouted legs. At the heart of The Amazing World of 
Gumball is Gumball, who faces the trials and tribulations 
of any 12-year-old-kid, like being chased by a rampaging 
T-Rex, or dressing as a cheerleader to impress the girl of
his dreams. The Amazing World of Gumball is the first UK
produced full length animation series out of Cartoon Net-
work Development Studio Europe. The series combines 2D and
3D animation in a live-action setting.
