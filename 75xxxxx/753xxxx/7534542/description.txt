"Many Sides of Fred Neil" was the first CD issue of the reclusive folk legend's Capitol Records releases from the 1960s, a handful of LPs, some singles and altenatve takes. Best known for "Everybody's Talking" (which Nilsson sang as the "Midnight Cowboy" theme), "The Other Side to the This Life" and "The Dolphins"(covered by dozens of artists) and "Candy Man" (one of Roy Orbison's early hits), Neil shied away from public performances and quit recording in the late 1960s. Though he lived until 2001, he continued to live in relative obscurity for the next 40 years.
