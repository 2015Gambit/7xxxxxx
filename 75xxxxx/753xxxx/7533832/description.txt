With F-Sim Space Shuttle, a number one flight simulator for iOS finally arrives on Android. It simulates the space shuttleΓÇÖs approach and landing in unprecedented detail and accuracy. Take command of the Orbiter during the final minutes of descent, and touchdown safely at the John F. Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base.

After the landing, you can watch a replay of your flight from different perspectives, like a chase plane or from the tower. A sophisticated landing analysis also is available, and only the best pilots are awarded a ΓÇ£perfect landingΓÇ¥ score.
