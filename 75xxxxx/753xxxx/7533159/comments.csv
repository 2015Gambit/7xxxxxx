,july1971,2012-08-16T15:49Z,TY so much from Denmark : )
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-16T16:48Z,"so, what is going to happen if somehow they stop this site from functioning?"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-16T20:32Z,I don´t know what will happen then...! That is good question...
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-16T20:38Z,"well, if that happens (let's hope not), can you do this on other torrent site?"
,Pegasus03,2012-08-16T21:45Z,If that happens we can self do the downloading in the internet. 
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-17T08:48Z,"oh yeah, and how would you do that if NO ONE uploading them first, because so far only MsFenmore is doing it. If it wasn't she/he, we would be with finger in mouth."
,Pegasus03,2012-08-17T09:59Z,"Everybody can tape with the Online Tv Recorder (OTR) from the internet. I Don't know, but my guess is, that Ms. Fenmore uses that recorder, too. German can download ad-free and so these eps are ad-free here. Otherwise you have to remove the TV ads from the eps yourself. This just for the case..."
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-17T11:04Z,"well, it will be very comfortable.
I really hope they WON'T terminate this site."
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-17T18:12Z,"Yepp, I´m using the OTR in the first place..but if it doesn´t work I have ( for now) other sources...but the OTR is the easiest..."
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-18T10:45Z,"I don't want to overwhelm this place with too many messages, but does any one knows how can you do the watching from other countries in Europe?
And one other thing, wow - surprise, what are the other sources you mentioned if it is not a secret, of course?
Thank you that you bother to reply to my questions!"
