2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

As I've said before, my goal here on The Pirate Bay is to share 1000 Christian albums, recorded in 2012, before the end of 2012.  I fell short of that goal back in 2011, having only shared 964 releases for 2011, combined over 36 different torrent bundles.  But in part that's probably because I got a late start doing it from September '11 through to December '11.

This year I started in February '12, and including this 29th torrent today, we now have 762 christian releases to sample for 2012.  I would like to thank everyone who continues to share this music today, long after it's seeded and I've moved onto the next bundle.

The 25 new titles in this 29th bundle includes...

 * Anchor And Braille - 2012 - The Quiet Life
 * Attaboy - 2012 - Ambient Love EP
 * Chris Sligh - 2012 - For Our God And King
