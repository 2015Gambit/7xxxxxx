The Recordings for this album were made on digital Equipment by NOS Radio
in Holland for the AVRO Radio Program 'Folk Live' at the Carr√© Theatre
in Amsterdam on October the 6th 1983.

As founder Member Luke Kelly tragically died only a few Months after this
Concert, those Recordings are the very last Dubliners' Recordings with Luke.

This Album is as much a historical Event as it is a musical Highlight in
the Career of one of Europe's finest musical Groups: 'The Dubliners'.
