extremezone, have you got any info regarding Sleeping Dogs crack?

A guy at a site that handles Skidrow releases used your name saying there won't be one. But there's no truth in this, right?"
,B.Torrents,2012-08-16T18:36Z,Thanks...

Really good copy, dvd quality. It's a little grainy in parts if you have a huge monitor or something, but otherwise it's great. As far as the film, I don't usually comment on anything, but this one was so good I had to stop lurking and say thank you for the upload."
