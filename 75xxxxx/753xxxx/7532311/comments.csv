,mgwump200,2012-08-15T16:52Z,"A couple of observations - A lot of these PDF`s not in English, Most are about Egyptology and not specifically Pyramids. Also Archive is corrupted and only 75% decompresses so Everything from letter M-Z is lost. So although this is a great resource for budding Egyptologists , A little work needed.

Thanks for sharing though."

I will look into the archive, but it tests healthy.  Perhaps your DL went bunk.  Did you do a hash check?"
,NorthCrane,2012-08-15T17:03Z,"mgwump200,

After reading my description and title of the torrent, I'm not sure if I ever specifically said that this document archive only pertains to pyramids.  I apologize for being confusing with the title."
,mgwump200,2012-08-15T20:09Z,"Hi NorthCrane just did an md5 hash check and it failed so my apologies for jumping the gun - its likely to be my download as my main broadband failed at 2pm today (I`m posting from my mobile) I,ll try and D/L when Its back up.
Thanks again."
,mgwump200,2012-08-15T20:57Z,"Actually - not sure if the hash check is valid - I think I may be confusing an MD5 hash check with an info hash check . - when I reloaded torrent file it `checked` o.k. 
When you look at your archive - does everything above letter M - Z show as zero file size?"
,NorthCrane,2012-08-16T14:28Z,"mwgump200,

Were you seeding when trying to unzip it?  :)"
,mgwump200,2012-08-16T14:56Z,"No  had moved files to another directory. when unzipped. later I moved the Archive file back to my seeding directory and reloaded the torrent file which checked itself O.K. then started seeding.
When viewed in windows explorer the unzipped PDF`s from M-Z show as 0Kb file size."
