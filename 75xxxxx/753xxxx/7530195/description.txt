One of the rare games based on literature that "get it" right, The Dark Eyeis not so much a "game" as an electronic novel in the same vein as Portal : it is a melange of Edgar Allen Poe's most famous stories, changing the characters' names to fit an overarching plot while preserving the contents.

The game uses three classic Poe stories: "The Tell-Tale Heart," "The Cask of Amantillado," and "Berenice." You go through each story twice - first as the victim, and again as the perpetrator. As if that's not creepy enough, the game also uses as a framing device an original story that is a very intriguing pastiche of Poe mythos.

Gameplay involves clicking on various objects and people to trigger events to advance the story. Despite this limited click-and-watch, the game's haunting atmosphere and style (with unique claymation actors) make it a must-have for horror fans. If you are a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, you'll tremendously enjoy this CD-ROM; if you're not, this is one CD that will spark your interest in his works. A must-have, and a proud entrant into our Hall of Belated Fame.
