The Crusades: Crescent and the Cross
The Crusades: Crescent & The Cross presents the epic battle between two Middle Age superpowers: the Christian Crusaders and the Muslims. Fought over two centuries, the conflict decided the fate of the Holy Land of the Middle East. Only a tiny strip of land, just a few hundred miles long, it contained the ultimate prize, the city of Jerusalem. Experience the murder, treachery, and bloodshed of the first, second, and third Crusades through the eyes of key historical figures such as Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, King Louis VII, and Nur al-Din. With breathtaking CGI-enhanced visuals, heart-pounding re-enactments, and stunning footage from rarely seen locations, this documentary brings the legendary chapter of history alive, and offers fresh insight for a new generation in conflict. Sound familiar? It should, because although the events depicted in the History Channel's The Crusades - Crescent & The Cross took place nearly a thousand years ago, they are but a distant mirror to what's going on in the Middle East right now.




3)  Disc Two the Second and Third Crusades 
An enigma even in his own time, Saladin became a hero in the West long before his rediscovery in the Muslim world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His famous truce with Richard the Lionheart is the most iconic moment in the entire history of the crusades. But why did Saladin negotiate a truce when he won nearly every battle? This programme will tease out the hidden history of Saladin, Richard and the Third Crusade. Saladin unexpectedly rises to power upon the death of Nur Al-Din. Under him 'jihad', or Islamic counter-crusade, becomes a coherent rallying concept for the Muslim world. Unifying Syria and Egypt, he defeats the crusaders at Hattin to reconquer Jerusalem in 1187.
