ΓÇ£We have manuscripts of a good type of substantial material from every century. It is one of the great things that separates the New Testament from anything else. Evidence down from the centuries.ΓÇ¥

    -Dr. Peter Head, Tyndale House and Cambridge University

This thirty minute documentary attests to the historical accuracy and reliability of the New Testament Gospels. It demonstrates unequivocally that the oldest manuscripts of the Christian Gospels are completely consistent with the present day Bible.

It explains in detail how this consistency has resulted from the dedication of New Testament scribes and other guardians of Biblical integrity. They devoted their lives to the accurate preservation of the Gospel accounts and the other documents making up the New Testament ΓÇô just as Jewish scribes did for the Old Testament.

This DVD demonstrates how the Jesus Accounts are based on solid evidence, significant ancient manuscripts, eyewitness accounts, and much more. Here is a convincing program that provides understanding and a framework to respond to those who doubt or seek to undermine the evidence for Jesus' life and ministry. The program draws on the expertise of numerous New Testament scholars and helpfully explains the background to the spread of the first manuscripts. Filmed on location in Istanbul and the UK. A great program for believers and those seeking to understand the scriptures' teaching about Jesus. Approx. 30 minutes.
