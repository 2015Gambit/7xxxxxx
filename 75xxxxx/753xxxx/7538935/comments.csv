How sad. This may be correct and legitimate, but that one file sinks the ship.

There is NO SUCH THING AS A SKIDROW WEBSITE!!! That would be like the mafia telling the police where they are."
,DANIfb,2012-08-17T00:47Z,"OmniNegro SHUT UP!

this is a ORLYDB CERTIFICATE!"
,ollefet123,2012-08-17T01:10Z,Working perfectly. Give the guy a break.
,LeoSky,2012-08-17T01:17Z,It's legit
,Kronical4,2012-08-17T02:20Z,THIS IS LEGIT DONT LISTEN TO THAT FIRST GUY. TIKASUKAZ is just trying to make a name for himself check up on your info before commenting something so wrong. Thanks tikasukaz +1 for me bro!
,Kronical4,2012-08-17T02:24Z,"@OmniNegro I have heared this saying a loit latley and its still just as stupid the 50th time, most mafia's do have a office you fucking idiot, its called laundering money through a company, and the police do know about it so once again your a fucking idiot, find a better saying its not clever."
,Hajeil,2012-08-17T02:34Z,@OmniNegro You are incorrect. There are many sites with the SKIDROW name attached to them. Google it and find out for yourself. These places are usually where these files can be found first before they get uploaded here. Obviously it is more than likely not run by an actual member of SKIDROW but more than likely is one of the distributors for them. Please do a little more investigating about how Scene groups and releases work before you decide to talk bad about someone like you know what's going on.
,OmniNegro,2012-08-17T03:20Z,"Apparently no-one read what I said...

I specified if may be correct and legitimate. I only object because it lists one of the fake ass sites that pretends to be Skidrow.

I do not now, and will never in all eternity support one of those fake sites, nor anyone who suggests they are trustworthy.

By the way Kronical4, just because there is an office building used by the mafia, that in no way means it is legit. Call me names and shit yourself some more. I do not call you names.

Is this legit? Perhaps. I will not find out. Good day to everyone."
,Jfudge17,2012-08-17T03:35Z,Using the origial skidrow release from awesome i just updated with the skidrow update 1 and my saves were not found. i think i found were they are being put now. origially in a darksiders 2 folder in my documents. now saves seem to be in either app data under skidrow or in that same first darksiders folder in my documents but in a folder named english. ive tried putting my old save files in both locations and keep just getting a corrupt save or no saves found. anyone else getting this or anyone have any suggestions? i got pretty far and the idea of starting over when i was in the middle of an awesome part is kinda game breaking expecially with sleeping dogs around the corner. any ideas to fix or just keep my saves and go reinstall without update and hope it still works? any help would be greatly appreciated thanks
,JerombaCZ,2012-08-17T07:19Z,this is legit and btw USELESS if you don't have problems with starting game...another uploader that can't copy few words from changelog and paste them into info
,JerombaCZ,2012-08-17T07:19Z,oh here it is...sorry tikasukaz
