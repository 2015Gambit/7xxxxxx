Here's a special treat for my fellow millennials: 30 minutes of opening credits from cartoons of our childhoods. Some of these were on only briefly, cancelled after a season or two. Others were on for much longer, and a handful are still on today.

Inspired by the earlier video "30 Minutes of 90s Cartoon Openings", I decided to put together a compilation of TV shows I remember vividly from my childhood. Some of these I completely forgot until I looked them up on one of Wikipedia's lists. I hope you enjoy watching this as much as I enjoyed making it.
