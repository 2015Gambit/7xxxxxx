,the_morgs,2012-08-15T11:03Z,"A/10
V/10

Perfect quality, although has Korean subtitles"
,skritzen,2012-08-15T11:18Z,Are they hardcoded subs?
,Fanchig,2012-08-15T15:02Z,Same question about quality + any hardcoded subs..
,Fanchig,2012-08-15T15:19Z,Likely harcoded judging from .mkv's name and from comments on Hackulus' twin upload of this movie.
,Nerfmi,2012-08-15T16:10Z,"there are no seeders , is that normal?"
,CAPTAINBEYEO2,2012-08-15T17:46Z,"@ ratan_1
               this for making comments on 
the upload and not for ADVERTISING."
,bandi8888,2012-08-15T23:01Z,"ratan_1
It doesn't work I tried"
,punx_roxer,2012-08-16T03:06Z,how do you extract the subs?  i tried using mkvmerge tools and it only shows one video file and one audio file? 
,casper0077,2012-08-16T13:42Z,how do you hardcoded subtitles without losing quality?
,xblaze45,2012-08-17T10:57Z,Hardcoded KOR subs and looks like kor edition even with the english voice. lame!
,blipoids,2012-08-17T22:44Z,LAME hardcoded subs... should've been in the description. Sorry.
,TheNemo,2012-08-18T02:45Z,"@Hackulus, you uploaded this one a bit after an (identical?) torrent that ended in ""AC3-JYK"" instead of just ""AC3"". How come? Is there something wrong with the previous or what?

Also, does anybody know it the korean ""version"" of the film means any scenes are missing or edited? 

Thank you!"
