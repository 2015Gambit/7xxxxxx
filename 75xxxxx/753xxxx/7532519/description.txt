This torrent contains:

1.Skyrim Dawnguard DLC
2.Update 9
3.Update v1.7706

How to install:

1.Download torrent, run the installer, point it to you Skyrim folder
2.At the Skyrim Launcher, go into Data Files and check the Dawnguard.esm option to Load. If Data Files is greyed out follow steps 3 and 4
3.Locate or search for the SkyrimPrefs.ini file that should be under your My Games subfolder. For example, mine is located at:
C:UsersELOCKLORANMy DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim
4.Open that file and search for [Launcher] and add "bEnableFileSelection=1". It'll look something like this:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
So add that line so it looks like:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
bEnableFileSelection=1
Now the Data Files option will be un-greyed and selectable
5.Launch the game and go talk to any generic Skyrim Guard. They'll give you a new quest item, Dawnguard, and you'll get the screen popup of new quest added.
This is how it worked for me. Some people won't have that greyed-out Data Files problem in steps 3-4, and it sounds like some people don't need to talk to a guard but get the Dawnguard quest automatically.
