 It's an alright copy to watch by yourself - maybe with others if you want to fool around with audio/video settings.

 But AS IS, the audio is tinny and uneven (it can actually hurt at times with headphones on - someone amp'd it) and the video's aspect ratio is incredibly narrow (it's obviously been shrunk down to look clearer - because of that stretching to 16:9 makes it look very blurry and of course extremely distorted lol).

 Probably better off to wait for an official dvd/bluray rip, shouldn't be much longer."
