"What Lies Beneath"

After learning that Noel and his family's cabin had
something to do with "that night" and possibly
Maya's disappearance, the girls work to try and put
the pieces together. Hanna and Emily head out to
the Kahn family cabin looking for clues linking
Maya to the site, while Spencer does some snooping
of her own on Noel. Could Noel have had a hand in
this after all, or are he and Jenna just bluffing
to send Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer down the
wrong path? Meanwhile, Aria must deal with the
aftermath of meeting Ezra's mom and the information
about Ezra's past.
