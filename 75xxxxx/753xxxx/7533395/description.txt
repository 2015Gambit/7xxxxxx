Masterchef Allstars Season 1 Episode 15

All your favourite MasterChef contestants from seasons past, return to the MasterChef kitchen for the first ever MasterChef All Stars.

It wouldnΓÇÖt be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George.

After sourcing ingredients for tonight's challenge at Sydney Fish Markets, the top four All Stars are greeted by 100 Navy heroes. They learn they must cook lunch and be judged by the Navy heroes. 

Enjoy!
