Possum Living: How to Live Well Without a Job and With Almost No Money was written in the mid-1970s by a teenaged girl named Dolly Freed. She lived with her father on half an acre outside Philadelphia. The book was originally published in 1978.

    Raising rabbits, chickens, pigs, and goats for meat
    Catching and cooking fish
    Gardening
    Preserving food
    Making moonshine
    Low-cost housing
    Utilities
    Clothing

This book does take cheap to extremes. (It reminds me of ThoreauΓÇÖs Walden.) Most of us donΓÇÖt want to live like this. But for those interested in frugality or homesteading, thereΓÇÖs plenty to be gleaned from these pages.

In this book you will find much practical information for saving money, but telling you how to do so isnΓÇÖt my only goal. Frankly, I hope to inspire you to do some independent thinking about economics as it affects the course of your individual life now and in the coming ΓÇ£age of shortages.ΓÇ¥
