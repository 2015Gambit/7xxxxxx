After getting the bad news that he is soon to die of cancer, Max wants to escape to the most beautiful place in the world ΓÇô Mexico. When he accidentally lands at EmmaΓÇÖs pig farm, he realizes that true happiness waits just around the corner... Emma is a pig-breeder at a shabby and indebted farm. She slaughters the pigs in her own way: she treats them lovingly till the last day; the lethal cut shows something like tenderness and in EmmaΓÇÖs strong arms the dying animals cease bleeding, calmly and submittingly. But Emma is lonely. The missing man in her life is replaced by her motor-bike. But the loneliness stays. Until one night when a Jaguar crashes on her farm. Inside the wrecked car lies an unconscious man and a bag full of money. EmmaΓÇÖs luck seems to be perfect: fate has thrown money ΓÇô and a man, Max ΓÇô into her lap. Suspecting that he has stolen the money, Emma hides the man in her bed and the money under her bed. But soon Hans, MaxΓÇÖs best friend and employer, turns up and wants his money back. In an attempt to reconciliate, Hans brings Max to a nearby hospital. Emma overcomes her shyness and finally brings him back home to the farm. Their last days together are sweetened by happiness, but MaxΓÇÖs days are numbered. Finally, he takes an example from the pigs and surrenders to EmmaΓÇÖs tender nature.
