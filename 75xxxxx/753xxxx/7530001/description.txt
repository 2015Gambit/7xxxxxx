Akshat aka Mr. Majnu (Akshat) and Suman (Neha Singh) are among a group of six college friends in Bombay. Suman, who is from a small town, is called back by her parents for her marriage. When her to-be in law refuse the marriage proposal due to an inadequate dowry, a disheartened Suman returns to Bombay.

She now makes up her mind to marry a millionaire at any cost. She and her friends go to various places(malls, high-end stories etc) in search of a rich and eligible bachelor, but their efforts lead to nothing as Suman is a rather plain-looking girl. Then, Akshat, who was so far amused at what was happening, takes up the charge of fulfilling Suman's desire. He gives her a makeover and introduces her as Simmi to a rich businessman, Neil Raj Chopra. Neil soon falls in love Suman.

Although Suman doesn't really love Neil, she is happy that her dream would be finally be fulfilled. Akshat, on other hand, starts working hard on his modeling career in spite of the fact that he has fallen in love with Suman.
