,fpr8653,2012-08-17T00:33Z,"its called ""activator"", its definitely in there as I made this torrent only a few hours ago.....  maybe your antivirus has deleted it?"
,NMSM,2012-08-17T00:41Z,"Activator man.... can't be more explicit...

By the Way keep up the excellent work man! Great torrent, will seed it 24/7 Thanks"

,livingcool,2012-08-18T12:22Z,"hi there. i experience difficulties running the activator. my computer is link to the dashboard but bitdefender total security 2013 keeps on deleting the activator. so i transferred the activator to a USB. booted in safe mode wit networking, run the activator but it still tells me my bitdefender is not linked to my computer (dashboard clearly shows my computer name).  i checked the dashboard, it has my computer name in it. tried booting many times but to no avail. please help. tyvm!"
,sumitbodele,2012-08-18T13:39Z,no speed.....seed guys
,fpr8653,2012-08-18T13:47Z,"did you install bitdefender with the internet switched off? if you installed bitdefender with the internet on it will of downloaded new files during the installation, otherwise..... while in safe mode with networking, copy the activator from USB to your desktop, then right click ""run as administrator"" and report back with your results :)"
,livingcool,2012-08-18T15:35Z,"hey fpr8653, thanks for the help! i realised i forgot to verify the email ( my carelessness). 

To other users: as an extra precaution i disabled my internet until installation has finished; after which  ""Get Started"" Tab appeared, slightly before logging in.  

Thanks! "
,NMSM,2012-08-18T17:42Z,"BTW i just have one doubt, in mybitdefender page it says i have only 30 days, but in the program itself it says 20 thousand or so days left, there's no worries about that right?

Cheers, it's just in case i messed something up ;) thanks again"
,fpr8653,2012-08-18T21:19Z,"after the 30 days is up the remote features (such as anti theft and remote scanning) will stop working but everything else on the laptop (firewall, antivirus, antispam etc) will all function 100% :)"
,NMSM,2012-08-20T00:59Z,"Thank you so much for your excellent work, and for the clarification of my doubt. :D Cheers mate!"
,biebie26,2012-08-20T17:27Z,hey ppl i have found out that if you use the crack from 2012 it works better and you can update fine and even have 12392 days left
,webmaster16,2012-08-21T20:23Z,"Hey!!! Thanks I have 365 days left.

,gil80,2012-08-23T08:01Z,"Hi.
After installing while I'm connected, I try to log in but it says ""An unexpected error occurred while performing this action""
I then created a new accoutn with different email to no avail... also sign in with google of Facebook didn't help... so if I can't sign in to my account with the application I can't use the crack.. help anyone..."
,amoguy1,2012-08-23T20:36Z,"This is fucking bullshit! I've been trying to install this for the past 3 hours.... Can't do shit. Every time i open the activator it says i don't have permission, then i turn off the anti virus and it fucking deletes the activator.... Getting really pissed, would help if someone would make a video or something. FUCK ME"
,burnoutz,2012-08-23T20:53Z,"I'm having the same problem as gil. Tried a fake email, my real email and the gmail option. The first two don't work, but when I try gmail, I type my info and I get ""your internet connection has timed out causing the authentication to fail. Please submit your account info again."" I click OK and it says ""you are logged in as XXX@gmail.com"" But i'm really not. I still tried going to safe mode and activating, but it says I have no account and to go to normal mode and make one.

So as gil said, HELP!"
,ajhougeois,2012-08-24T02:24Z,"hey, i've installed it yesterday and follow the steps. i've got a 365 days left when i used the crack, and only 30 days in my bit-account, its perfectly working... but now, when i opened my pc, it only shows that i have 30days left.. pllzzz nid help..."
,burnoutz,2012-08-24T04:11Z,"Ok, so after my last post I thought I could try installing the program from the BD website. I download it and I still have the same problem. So now I figure I may as well contact BD and ask why their program doesn't work."
,NATIBOY2013,2012-08-24T11:22Z,"i just want you to know that i created this id just to say thanks...for any one that cant install this torrent there is something wrong with you or your computer..this torrent works perfectly...after you reboot your computer from activating in safe mode click on the date and time on your taskbar. change the date to 31 days ahead of time (you can always change this back)...restart your computer just to be safe, i always do this after making changes,..now click your firewall settings on the bitdefender control icon. at the bottom of the screen you will see your active time remaining...thx alot fpr8653...just want you to know how much i appreciate the effort put in to this...."
,NATIBOY2013,2012-08-24T11:27Z,by the way dont be alarmed when you log onto mybitdefender.com and see: EVALUATION VERSION-EXPIRED....this just means the trial version is expired your program is still functioning properly.....
,NATIBOY2013,2012-08-24T11:34Z,i also just noticed on my previous  comment that when you change your computers date back to the right date it resumes your 30 day free trial...enjoy ppl and give credit where credit is due...

,rani9990,2012-09-02T23:24Z,"I'm also having problems with mybitdefender, Cannot login with gooogle/facebook, and trying to normally register or login gives the unexpected error has occurred message. HELP!"
,tenashas,2012-09-09T20:47Z,"Guys I wanted to let you know that this does in fact work perfectly. 

Just like kxt2009 said:

1 I have already an account on bitdefender. Whithout an account the activator don't work
2 I installed the antivirus bitdefender 2013 on my pc
3 I boot in Safe Mode with network (press F8 before windows logo begin)
4 I run the activator ( the activation is 1 year)
5 I reboot pc in normal mode
6 I entered on bitdefender ONLINE account and I update the Antivirus to the latest virus definitions

FYI once installed BD will DELETE the activation file because it recognizes is as a virus. Follow step 3 above, boot in safe mode, and RE-DOWNLOAD this torrent. Activate and reboot. 

Big thanks to fpr8653!"
,bmap12222,2012-09-11T06:06Z,"For everyone who has a problem with the crack if you have ever EVER had bitdefender on your computer before you have to open the crack in safe mode with networking and put the license file back to it original state. The program will give you this option. 
This is for the error where when logging in via the software it says something like ""and unexpected error occurred"" or if your using facebook or gmail it will say ""internet connection timed out"" 

I hope this helps 

btw sometimes when you turn your computer on you'll have to check to make sure that the auto scan and auto update are still turned on because for some reason they have a habit of turning themselves off. - if anyone finds the solution to this please tell me (bmap12222@yahoo.com)"
,livingcool,2012-09-12T16:29Z,"Hey there. I've been using it for almost a month and in the past one or two days, i've realised that im left with ""5 Days left"" instead of the usual ""24xxx Days Left"" - 65 year period. Also, when i clicked on it, it shows that my version is the trial version instead of the registered version. 

Has your crack been patched by Bitdefender already? If so, is there a fix coming soon?

Thanks."
,foreignadaption,2012-09-12T20:35Z,"Awesome Thanks!

I just followed the steps that came with the file and activated it for 65 years through settings like the setup explains. Bitdefender says 23741 days left on the license, but the website says 30 days. We will see in 65 years which is right. "
,kolot182,2012-09-12T21:10Z,my problem is that when i activate it. i says that i did not add an account. but i already login to my account. pls help me guys!
