Instructions:

Most of the apps are for Rooted devices only; they require Root access to work.


*BusyBox Pro*

First install BusyBox Pro. Run BusyBox Pro and update your BusyBox to the latest version.


*Superuser Elite*

Next install Superuser. If you already have superuser installed, update it to the latest version.

Install Superuser Elite v0.8 and launch the app to activate the Elite version.

Update superuser binary to the latest version.


*ROM Manager Premium*

Next install ROM Manager. Install Premium key and launch the app.


*SPB Shell 3D*

Activate Airplane mode to disable all wireless communications.

Install SPB Shell 3D. Do not launch the app.

Install Lucky Patcher v0.8.3 provided in the folder and patch SPB Shell 3D:
Launch Lucky Patcher -> Long press on SPB Shell 3D -> Select 'Apply Google Market Patch'

After patching, exit Lucky Patcher and launch SPB Shell 3D.

Deactivate Airplane Mode to enable all wireless communications again.

Uninstall Lucky Patcher v0.8.3 and install the latest version of Lucky Patcher.

Note:

Lucky Patcher requires root access and superuser permissions to work. Make sure you have root access and superuser installed on your device otherwise it won't work.

Latest versions of Lucky Patcher fail to patch SPB Shell 3D so use the provided older version to patch SPB Shell 3D. Once patching is done, you can uninstall the old version of Lucky Patcher; it won't affect the patch.


*Titanium Backup Pro*

Install Titanium BackUp. Do not launch the application.

Install Pro Key. Do not launch.

Run Lucky Patcher. Update to the latest Version if Required. It will show 'Custom Patch found' notification for Titanium Backup. Long press on Titanium Backup -> Select 'Custom patch!' to apply the patch.

Exit Lucky Patcher and launch Titanium Backup Pro.


*PowerAMP*

Install PowerAMP. Do not launch the app.

Launch PowerAMP and enjoy the fully activated version.


Rest all apps are straight forward, no patching is required. Just install the apps, install pro key if provided and launch.


All apps are tested and they work properly. If you follow the instructions, there won't be any problems. 


All the files are scanned thoroughly and are free of malware.


Have Fun!
