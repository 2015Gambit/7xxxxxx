,Jfudge17,2012-08-17T03:36Z,Using the origial skidrow release from awesome i just updated with the skidrow update 1 and my saves were not found. i think i found were they are being put now. origially in a darksiders 2 folder in my documents. now saves seem to be in either app data under skidrow or in that same first darksiders folder in my documents but in a folder named english. ive tried putting my old save files in both locations and keep just getting a corrupt save or no saves found. anyone else getting this or anyone have any suggestions? i got pretty far and the idea of starting over when i was in the middle of an awesome part is kinda game breaking expecially with sleeping dogs around the corner. any ideas to fix or just keep my saves and go reinstall without update and hope it still works? any help would be greatly appreciated thanks

,JerombaCZ,2012-08-17T07:16Z,and one message for uploader...how bout you share those few words in changelog here in torrent info so people don't dload useless update which corrupts their old saves
