Bad torrent."
,pc-Gnome,2012-08-16T23:35Z,"You do understand that 99% of ""no sound"" is due to a missing codec - the file is just fine."
,BoonesFerry,2012-08-17T08:41Z,"I prefer x264 mp4. Superior video quality, and generally a smaller file size. "
,BoonesFerry,2012-08-29T15:58Z,"The audio is garbled. 
Quite often this can be a player/codec issue.
In this case, NOT a player/codec issue.
The issue is on your end, pc-Gnome."
