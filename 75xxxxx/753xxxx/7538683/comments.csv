Setup had detected that version 1.00.000 is already installed. This setup is not compatible with this version.

I will try the other updates first I guess."
,10hellfire01,2012-08-30T04:07Z,Same. So im going to try to install them patch by patch and see.

Yeah, install them in order from v1.1 and up. Should work then."

Finally the game works fine, they fixed the framerate issue.

There's only one thing bothering me, in game I can't change weapons, no matter wich keys I assign for changing weapons. Actually, I can change only once per level, but can't change after that.
It's not a big problem gameplay wise, but it's difficult to complete some of the challenges that require a specific weapon to be used.
I haven't found anything on google for that matter, I guess it's not a game bug.
I've tried everything, someone has an idea what could it be?

Otherwise, thnx for the UP, seeding.
