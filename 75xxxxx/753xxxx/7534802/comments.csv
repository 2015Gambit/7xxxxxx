I take back the generosity of my question/comment on one of your other torrents. This proves you are not to be trusted.

THIS CAN ONLY BE MALWARE. DO NOT USE THIS."
,NSSAndrew,2012-08-23T05:01Z,"@OmniNegro Dear OmniNegro, I am not a scammer and I never will be. The file works on my PC, I do not know why the file is 51.56. I promise you I will never ever scam ANYONE in the time I am on piratebay. I am sorry that you are mad at me for a internet mistake. If there is any way I can make this up to you reply to this comment.
 Sincerely, Andrew "
