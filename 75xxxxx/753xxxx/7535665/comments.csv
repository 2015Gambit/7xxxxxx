PopCap Games.rar is broken and can't extract all the games from the file.

Winrar reports Broken Archive

Insaniquarium! Deluxe is the last full game that will extract. The rest won't extract. 

Anybody else have the same problem?"

,registery1234567,2012-08-17T23:32Z,"Open and extract the files from the ISO using WinRar. After running the installer, I saw no use for the installer application. Even though it did give me serial number (no survey). It didn't do anything anyway other than just navigate to the ""Autoplayscriptsscripts1"" folder which can be done manually without using the installer. Once there, manually extract all the file from the PopCap Games.rar file. Which contains all the games using WinRar.

You will find that only half the games will extract anyway. Since the RAR file is damaged and can't be repaired.

If someone has a working copy of this excellent package with all the Pop Cap Games. Would appreciate if they could upload and share here."
