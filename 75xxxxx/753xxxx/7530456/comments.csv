It is set by default as C:/[etc.] so I click ""advanced"" and I choose to put it in D:/[etc.] then when I click next it says: The Sims 3 Double Deluxe will install additional *.MB on your hard Drive C:. Continue with installation? So I click no and when it brings me back, it had put by default in the advanced options C:/[etc.]. I can't install games on my C: drive since it has only 20GB left and is intended to run Windows (SSD). Would you suggest anything to be able to install it on my other Hard Drive?"
