My first torrent, and first customized DVD.

First off, it may look bad when played on a computer, but when burned to a disc and played on a DVD player, such as an Xbox 360, it looks incredible. I have tested this out personally.

I included a menu, chapters, thumbnails, and even background music. I also included 6 additional music videos.

-toxic
-everytime
-my prerogative
-do somethin'
-chris cox megamix

Total size is about 6.80, meaning a dual layered disc. If you want, go ahead and shrink it with DVDShrink, but I used a 720p version of the file for best quality on a TV.
