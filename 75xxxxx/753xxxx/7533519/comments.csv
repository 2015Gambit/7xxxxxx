,simoni1978,2012-08-15T17:00Z,Windows 8 RTM leaked ISOs activations now blocked [Update] by MS http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-8-rtm-leaked-isos-activations-now-blocked
,xpmule,2012-08-15T20:17Z,"why would you trust anyone that uploads operating system cracks to torrents ?
Its kinda like the people that download these custom cooked iso's from here.
VERY bad idea..
But i guess *some people have to learn their lessons the hard way.

The way i see it is of your too lazy to do your research and get your OS cracks from their source(s) then you deserve what you get..
And 2nd i sure as hell don't trust random noob kids that find things from god knows where and re-share them and upload them to torrent sites etc
You get the usual.
LiekZ OMGZ i founded S0M l33T Hax Yo !1111

Evene the highest quality of trusted uploaders make mistakes and upload infected files and i can prove too
There was a WinRar cracked release and a Sisoft Sandra release witha  keygen by BRD that was infected with an extremly serious trojan. BOTH had the same trojan just different versions/builds and these two examples were re-shared across the net like wild fire EVERYWHERE !
The trusted uploaders obviously didn't even test the files etc

So I have ever reason to be concerned about downloading random crap from P2P kiddies.

But hey thats just my opinion, everyone will of course do what they want lol"
,jedr93,2012-08-15T20:23Z,Does not work .. I get error
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-15T21:28Z,"@xpmule
