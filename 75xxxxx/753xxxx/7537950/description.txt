He found his grandmother in tears most of the time and watching her, he decided that he must reach Hari somehow. For many years Ani has been searching for Hari. So when Ani recognizes Hari in a TV program featuring Punjab, he sets forth to Punjab with great expectations of finding Hari.

In Punjab, he arrives in Mallu Street and to his wonder, he locates Hari. But Hari's name is Harinder Singh, he courts a beard and turban and his attire is purely Punjabi. Even in his behavior, Harinder Singh alias Mallu Singh looks a typical Punjabi. Ani wanted to make sure about Hari's identity and so decides to stay put for a longer period. While contemplating the hurdles he has to overcome in a strange land to learn the truth, help arrives in the form of Karthi and Pappan. Together, the three go in search of proof to make sure that Mallu Singh is Hari. Somewhere along the line, Suseelan joins the threesome making the situation worse. Suseelan came to Punjab to start a hair cutting saloon but on finding that no one in Punjab cuts his hair, took up cycle repair as his occupation for survival. Their probes and inquiries lead them through many adventures and they are featured very humorously in Mallu Singh.
