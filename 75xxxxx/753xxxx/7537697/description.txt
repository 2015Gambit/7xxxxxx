OOP RHINO COLLLECTION OF 1960S COLLEGE PARTY MUSIC

While it isn't flawless, this one easily beats most oldies compilations of this sort. If you are a diehard oldies fan,you probably already own most of the good stuff here. However, if you're a casual fan looking for some good party music, look no further. "Louie Louie", "Wooly Bully" and "Double Shot of My Baby's Love" are obvious picks but still are great tunes. "Nobody But Me" and "Just Like Me" are unexpected but welcome additions. Maybe a few songs feel out of place here, but mostly the groove is good.
