,prothc,2012-08-17T04:16Z,"Killermany, apparently you have to open the .iso file in Win7 or WinZip, and transfer all the information into the Darksiders II folder, and run setup.exe. Not sure, doing it now."
,Veroryn,2012-08-17T06:17Z,"Okay, killermany and prothc:

prothc said it's ""the same for all his SKIDROW downloads""

This leads me to believe you aren't reading the instructions. I'm downloading this now and I'll test that theory. For now, however, open a window on your computer and navigate to your install directory, probably something like C:/Program Files/Darksiders 2 or something like it, there might be more to it, figure it out. THe other window you should open is your ""Computer"" window, where you see the option to open your cd-rom drive, mounted drive, and the C: drive. Right-click your mounted drive when the .iso is mounted, and click ""Open"". You should see a SKIDROW folder in there. Open that. There should be some files in there that look the same as ones in your game install directory folder (the ""C:/Program Files/Darksiders 2"" or similar one). Copy all these files, folders, EVERYTHING into your game install directory. There should be a few pop-ups asking ""Do you want to merge ""folder x"" with ""other folder also named folder x"""" and/or ""There is already a file with the name ""File x"", what do you want to do?"" First off, click yes to merge the folders, if any. Then, click Copy and Replace for all the files. Also, there's a note in the instructions that says the exact following: 

""ADDITIONAL NOTES

Use Launcher.exe, included with the cracked content, for setting the language of your choice.""

At this point, you should be able to use the game properly. If you have a firewall, BLOCK the game from internet access, or if you're paranoid, dis-connect from the internet, but I almost never have to do these last steps, since SKIDROW is beast at removing internet requirement from their games.

Do this for EVERY SINGLE SKIDROW GAME YOU DOWNLOAD, they always set it up the exact same way. So far as the screen resolution problems, if I have that problem, I'll look into it, but I can't troubleshoot a problem I don't have :P Best of luck, seed like a bitch, and have a good day. Hope this helped!"

Open the .iso with winrar or whatever. Go inside the Skidrow folder and copy everything inside there to your darksiders installation folder (after installation ofcourse). When it asks if you want to replace a file, click yes.

Go to Task Manager -> Processes -> right Click on Darksiders 2 and Set Affinity for 1st 2 cores... I guess yours is triple core. I don't know much about AMD CPU's, but guess X3 means 3 cores. Some people have to do this for quad cores too. But I have Q8400 and face no problems."

I downloaded Legends of Pegasus from same uploader and it isn't working, for same reason as many others listed on that upload. The responses from a variety of Control Geeks is that we are stupid if it doesn't work. I think some enlightened information would be more helpful.

,Dufox,2012-08-25T20:13Z,"this game has:
1. average graphics in todays standards. you wont say wow but you also wont say wtf.
2. characters and worlds from the most popular mythology.
3. a fighting system that is surprisingly well made. you can mash buttons and still make it or you can learn combos and watch the beauty.
4. a loot system that is becoming the standard added to a solid character customization.
5. absolutely amazing and well thought out puzzles. when you play its completely obvious that every puzzle was thought out and strategically placed.
6. again absolutely amazing dungeons/mission scale. the best way i can think to describe the dungeons is to say it was inspired by zelda.
completely obvious every dungeon was built with time and discussion. 
7. massive size worlds with a large amount of different enemy types.
8. a large amount of secrets/collectibles/sidequests.

cons.
1. needs controller, keyboard will make you wanna slap someone.
2. the difficulty does not increase to a ""hardcore"" scale.
3. basically no configurations to controls (gamepad) or video/sound.

95% of all issues are technical ones.

how could you be disappointed in the game itself? "

,BayGhost,2012-08-27T11:19Z,"@Pawun
Yea, that was bothering me too... Don't know what's wrong with the control for the Reaper. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't  and reconfiguring the button doesn't fix the the problem. So when you want Reaper mode, just press Tab, and select the Reaper with your mouse. It's kind of a bother, but you'll get used to it. There's no other way than that. Because it's a port. Maybe when the official PC game comes out, somewhere in October, then they will fix that."
,BayGhost,2012-08-27T11:23Z,"@Roxter90

And why do you think it's a fail ? The graphics aren't that outdated. Besides it's not like they advertised it to be any better. You knew it was gonna be the same as it was in the first one, and yet you downloaded it... Try to pay more attention next time. And a game like this shouldn't have any better graphics. I think they are perfect, but to each his own i suppose."

,shipz2640,2012-08-27T18:51Z,"This is the single biggest piece of shit I've ever seen. THQ just needs to give up, sell the company, and let someone take over the franchise who can get the job done.

It's a shame when you can't even install a game and just enjoy it. You have to go through all this shit about figuring out why the MSVCR100.dll error is popping up (I guess THQ is too retarded to include the proper runtimes with the game itself like every other developer does who has half a brain). Then you have to figure out why you can't even see the game because of black screens. And no, this isn't just pirated copies. Just browse the Steam forums and look at the problems people have been posting in the Darksiders II forums.

I had high hopes for this game. Unfortunately THQ just can't get their shit together. Then companies wonder why sales are down by 90% because everyone is pirating instead of buying. Yeah, I wonder why someone would rather pirate a game to find out it sucks instead of blowing $60 to find out why that game sucks."
