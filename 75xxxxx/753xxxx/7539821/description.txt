Dust jacket notes: "The Radiant City (La Ville Radieuse), one of his fundamental and most important books, reveals the full genius of Le Corbusier. First published in 1933 and then, with some slight additions, republished in 1964, it has never before been available in English.

Proposing as it does a way out of the chaos of modern living through careful planning, it is as timely now - and will continue to be - as it was when first published. The same problems - healthy living conditions, noise, traffic, playground space, public transportation, etc. - will continue to be a major concern to all citizens of all lands until adequate, and sometimes revolutionary, measures are taken.

The Radiant City is a blueprint for the present and for the future. This edition, as nearly as possible a facsimile of the original edition which was supervised by Le Corbusier, but with English text, contains several hundred illustrations - photographs, plans and drawings by the author, four of them in color. It is a classic work on architecture and city planning, a book of the greatest importance."
