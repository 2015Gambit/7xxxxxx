*****FROM SOME DEADHEADS WHO ATTENDED THIS SHOW, THEY SAID THIS WAS SUPPOSEDLY 
THE SHOW THAT THE DEAD REALLY STARTED PLAYING A "DARK" SHOW THAT TOOK 
SOME OF THE CROWD INTO SOME SCARY ACID TRIPS DURING THE SECOND SET...ESPECIALLY 
WHEN THEY LAUNCHED INTO DRUMS...I THINK I'D HAVE BUGGED OUT TOO*******


Listen to this one with headphones....amazing!
