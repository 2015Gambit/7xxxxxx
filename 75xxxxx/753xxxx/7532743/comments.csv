[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-15T20:00Z,"Jailroll, sure I've heard of Pax217.  Kind of a punk and rap style band, right?  As a matter of fact, I have three of their releases, not just the two that you mentioned.  And I tossed it up here on The Pirate Bay for you just now.

If there's ever anything else you want to sample, please let me know.  It's always a good idea to post your requests in a few of my more recent threads, as I don't often revisit older threads once they're fully seeded.  :)"

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-16T16:42Z,"Sicanddisturbed, I would certainly share it if I had it, but unfortunately I only have Among The Thirsty's 2010 ""I Wanna Stay Here"" single.  Sorry about that."
,clardx1,2012-08-16T18:21Z,Thank you for all of your hard work. Can you look for Marvin Winans the praise and worship experience and Tamela Mann Best Days. Again thank you for all of your work.
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-16T19:14Z,"Clardx1, thanks for your kind words.  :)

As for the Marvin Winans title, I've been looking for it since it's release.  Unfortunately I haven't yet found it.  As for the Tamela Mann title, it's a great project by Tamela, one of her best pieces of work to date, and it'll be included in my next 31st bundle sometime soon."
