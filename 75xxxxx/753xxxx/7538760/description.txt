I made this to help set up and enjoy my 5.1 surround.

Four audio files:
Ghosts N Stuff.m4a
Test 1.m4a
Test 2.m4a
Test 3.m4a

Also included are the files' audacity data.

The Ghost N Stuff has some heavy bass, so be careful!

Open the audio files with VLC and make sure that the Audio->Device->5.1 is selected.
