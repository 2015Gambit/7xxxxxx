,BrianAUS,2012-08-16T15:12Z,Thanks for these mate! I'm from Australia - appreciate them as I have a hard time finding or downloading anywhere else! Can I ask whether these will work when I convert them onto my Apple TV? I have had instances where the whole ep is extremely pixelated  and unwatchable :( Hoping these work... I have them on the download list now. Appreciate the time you put into getting these up - cheers mate.

,Dimmis80,2012-08-16T22:10Z,"No my good friend Jmanwf don't give up mate.!I know or not.!I don't know about uploading to be honest and it seems that it takes a lot of time and ours and more in dayle basis and i know that u upload other series and stuff.!And ofcorse u might have your job if u working and again ofcorse a lot of things to do above uploading for us.But u never forget the apreciation-understanding and joy u give us to all of us who can't have the opurtunity to watch our soap and that u do a very glorious job that u sare with us..The power of PB,of Torrents,of seeders,of people who cant afford or use to pay a lot for everything before torrents but cant afford to pay now and downloads stuff and ofcrse the most special of all the Uploaders.So u are special my friend and my humple opinion and from my point of view even to God eyes.And if u can't do with more Mibs and quality i know that most of the people will be very happy with just the episodes and stuff..So dont give up and u have a follower and not just me but thousands and one day your great work will be paid right back to u....And why not even a Legend.:-)"
