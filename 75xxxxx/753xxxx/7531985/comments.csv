,rhizzu,2012-08-15T11:14Z,"@kolagen
thanks for the response.
please keep seeding for 2/3week..

to everyone having trouble with the 30days trial reactivation by AVG during the auto update, just read and follow the guide on the description, or Reame!.txt"
,marklers,2012-08-15T19:54Z,what happens after 30 days?
,rhizzu,2012-08-16T05:26Z,avg will expire. anti-virus security will disable.
,rugburn11,2012-08-16T07:04Z,"Start up AVG Internet Security
go to TOOLS
FIREWALL SETTINGS ...scroll down for AVG

Not sure which one to block

AVG Identity Protection Service...?
AVG Installer Application...?
AVG Tray Monitor...?
AVG Watchdog Service...?

Can someone Please let us know thank you!!!!"
,rhizzu,2012-08-16T13:38Z,"@rugburn11

why blocking?

is it the for the reactivation? you want to block a certain processing apps?"
,bulldog343,2012-08-16T16:47Z,i installed it but it says anti virus is outdated but if i update by clicking on the 2 url's then it will activate the 30 day trial what can i do ?
,bulldog343,2012-08-16T16:50Z,"never mind something happened and it says it is active so now everything is working fine, thnx btw. "
,rugburn11,2012-08-17T18:54Z,"AVG figured out how to spot the Key Gen'd licenses. After a couple ours, you're back to the 30 day trial version. Too bad, I was satisfied with it while it lasted."
,rhizzu,2012-08-18T05:22Z,"@rugburn11

this you follow the instruction in AVG 30days removal.?

no setting and update. you need to disable 2 url by unchecking it, and add http://google.com/ instead and activate that one.
after that. before doing that. you need to activate it first by changing the key..

just use your head. everyone says its working to them."
,MrKaos7,2012-08-18T05:32Z,"I have a qs rhizzu, i installed the internet security and everything normal, but i didnt not wait for the 39 day reactivation trial msg to come up, i changed the url immediately, was dat wat i was supposed to do? or was i supposed to wait for the 30 day trial msg to com up first den change di url?"
,Ghost322,2012-08-19T08:16Z,The Keygen programs are viruses. What's Ironic is that I used AVG to find out that they have viruses
,rhizzu,2012-08-19T16:35Z,"@MrKaos7
you can have both. nothing change, the point is, just to disable the reactivation of 30days trial.

@Ghost322
LOL, right. it has a virus. 
false alarm""

don't be so dumb to fall on AVG scheme.
they added this keygen to their Virus database, as a harm-full virus and that's a lie.
why? of course, you can use AVG full without buying a license to them. right?
so making it a virus will prevent those idiots to use this keygen. right right?

understand?

if you didn't understand. then stop complaining.
and just leave. you are not helping here..
and you are the one whose rude."
,gianton,2012-08-20T08:52Z,"Working great so far, thanks!"
,gianton,2012-08-20T09:04Z,"It works so far, without re installing the app I had the latest version already!
Thanks"
,hewi456,2012-08-22T18:41Z,"nice one m8t, works with 2011 as well! this is what i love about computers where there is a will there is a way lol THANKS!!!"
,wknmm,2012-08-23T15:53Z,Worked great just doing a clean install and entering in the keygen key.  Updated fine and still ok on day 2.
,xLIM,2012-08-25T17:43Z,"If I change the url and I click the Update button, what will happen?"
,rhizzu,2012-08-26T10:14Z,"@xLIM
it wont auto install the 30 days trial serials.

^_^"
,xLIM,2012-08-27T17:46Z,"Then if I want to update, just go tick the two links?"
,rhizzu,2012-08-28T01:57Z,"@xLIM
right. be ready, if the 30days trial key automatically installed after you update. just generate another key to your keygen and insert it again."
