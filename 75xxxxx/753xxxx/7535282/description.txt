This is a rip of the raw bgm file contained in the root of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII game disk, converted into .wav file format. It contains every song all in one track. If you want the songs to be seperated, then you'll have to use an audio file editor, such as Cool Edit Pro or Soundbooth, to cut out each song. It's really easy to do that, though, since there's enough blank space in between each song.
