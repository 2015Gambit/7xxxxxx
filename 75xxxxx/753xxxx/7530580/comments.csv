,fancyp,2012-08-15T19:27Z,"Unable to delete avi file because it says it's in use, but as far as I can tell it is not. The mac also indicates it is trying to delete two files but I see only one. "
,RavennRavages,2012-08-16T10:46Z,"reply to fancyp :
fancyp, it probably says that its deleting two files because the second one is invisible for your computers protection :) ive no clue why it's not deleting though, ive had the same probelem with other types of files :/

anyways, thanks for upload "

,QT_3.14,2012-09-01T05:20Z,Downloading now:D How can I seed this?
,kkeenn123,2012-09-03T00:59Z,Files will not delete when uTorrent is using them. Remove the torrent from uTorrent cache and try again.
,premix314,2012-09-03T03:59Z,"This file took too long to download. The download speed was bouncing up and down the entire time and I didn't know if I was going to get the whole file in enough time. I have people depending on my download speed, and this file was late on the finish. Love the movie, hate the file. Overall rating for this torrent: 6/10 because it was finally worth it, waiting."
,45yu53,2012-09-04T20:29Z,"Mediocre quality, aspect ratio is like 16:7."
,ItsWolfeh,2012-09-07T00:00Z,"Really bad size/aspect ratio... Would not download if I were you, bad quality."
,masquemea,2012-09-09T07:30Z,How do you get the subtitles to work? I haven't been able to get them to show on any player.
