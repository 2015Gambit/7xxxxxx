,wishmasteruk,2012-08-30T22:30Z,hmm srtange not working for me i get a black screen and it keeps moving ps3game folder to root of hdd??
,urdandy,2012-09-06T19:29Z,It has two files of Eboot.Bin. Move and overwrite one which located in PS3_GAMES to PS3_GAMES/USRDIR where another one located. There should be no Eboot.bin(4062kb) in PS3_GAMES. It should move to PS3_GAMES/USRDIR.
,1bad966spdz,2012-09-10T03:23Z,Never got this one to work.. Out of all my games.. this is the first for me.. I tried a new eboot as well..And obviously didn't need a second eboot in the wrong location.. I have yet to delete it but will be soon if no other input is stated to get this game to run.. 4062 kb sized eboot is the same one that I downloaded from elsewhere.. One eboot freezes the ps3entirely.. the other just sends it back to the XMB. Anyone got this one to work? The wordpad that came with it was worthless...
