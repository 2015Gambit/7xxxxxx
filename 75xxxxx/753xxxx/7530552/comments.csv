Grimm is about the fairy tales that you have heard before bedtime comes to life when Detective Nick Burhardt (David Giuntoli ) thought that moving to Portland, Oregon was a good idea. It was until he started seeing things he couldn't explain such as normal beautiful women turning into hags or a normal man turning into a troll. Nick goes to his relative in the hospital who tells him that he has the Grimm, a supernatural power that is able to see the creatures in real life. With his partner Lt. Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) the pair track down a killer in a ""Little Red Riding Hood"" tale.
