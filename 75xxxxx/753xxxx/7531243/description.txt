This is a gentle little story of a woman who leaves the hectic life of the big city to go and live in the mountains of Patagonia. Unfortunately she's a bit of a bimbo and gets into all sorts of scrapes and misadventures. The story is told through the eyes of her young daughter Muriel.

Part of the pleasure of this little movie is getting to see a remote part of the world. The film itself seems to be in a poor state of preservation, I'm not entirely to blame for poor quality - Argentines should take better care of their own heritage.
