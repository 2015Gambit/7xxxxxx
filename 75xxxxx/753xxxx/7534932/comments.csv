Sleeping Dogs official release said DX10 and DX11 only - that means no Win XP."
,Kortzen,2012-08-15T21:00Z,"User ""HeroMaster"" already shared this one.

,Dead_Lord,2012-08-18T03:06Z,"@swebarb Then how come Hitman sniper challenge is cracked? 
Just wondering how much time I'm forced to expect and this is the first reason I've heard."
,premiado,2012-08-18T09:08Z,swebarb is right
,heykiller,2012-08-19T06:43Z,"@Dead_Lord if you don't like it then buy the game and you wont have to wait, like i pre ordered assassins creed 3 so i don't have to wait for a crack, plus i saved one check just to get it. if you can't wait then buy it. or is that to hard for you if so you will have to get over it, while you do get your thumb out and suck on it like the big baby you are.

,madkillerabdo,2012-08-19T06:46Z,"Well, on SKIDROW's website, the crack is supposedly ""in-progress"" ...so I wouldn't lose hope yet."
