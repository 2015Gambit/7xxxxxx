Planning the activation

Before executing its marketing activities, a firm will benefit from identifying which customer groups to target. “By focusing on some fewer influencers only, activation can become more efficient and higher returns can be expected.” [1]

Customer data is a significant source of information for planning marketing activation. A common practice is to use customer relationship management tools and techniques to augment the impact of marketing activation because CRM “provides an integrative framework in which marketing activation and customer activities collaborate to increase patronage” [2]

Challenges"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-14T02:35Z,"A successful marketing activation will allow businesses to increase their profits and reach their strategic goals. There are however challenges that managers will face in putting in place a marketing activation program. One of the challenges is dealing with an ever changing marketplace. Customer preferences and attitudes keep evolving and require managers to adapt rapidly. This poses a challenge because, for example, “direct marketing activation triggers that were accurate 6 months ago, may now be quite inappropriate.”[3]

Another challenge related to marketing activation has to do with reaching different target markets with culturally relevant propositions. McDonald’s is said to be a good example of a company that can effectively reach a diverse audience. Among the techniques it uses, “it engages in unique marketing activation, including strong use of PR and events targeted at black, Asian, and Latino youth.”[4]"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-14T02:36Z,"Over the years, marketing activation has become more and more data-driven. This allows marketers to be more precise in their actions, measure results more effectively, and increase returns. This phenomenon has become more and more important because “marketing activation usually entails a universal blast of information to all consumers. Oftentimes, only a small proportion of the consumers react positively to such activation, resulting to waste in marketing expenses. If a circle of influencers can be identified for certain events or phenomena, then such activities can be focused into a group of factors or individuals, thus, optimizing the outcomes.” [5]

Different types of data are used in marketing activation. For example, “video-based measurement (...) provides visibility into shopper engagement and behaviour relative to exact marketing activation, enabling a holistic approach to shopper marketing.”[6]"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-14T02:37Z,"CRM data and models are also used to improve the effectiveness of marketing activation. One of these models, the marketing funnel, “is a key conceptual framework that is routinely used by practitioners to deconstruct the marketing activation and identify key issues.”[7]
[edit]
Online video

Marketing activation can be enriched with the use of online tools. The advent of online video has opened up many opportunities for marketers who use it to engage customers in more compelling ways with new forms of advertising. Youtube, for example, “has given marketers a platform for celebrating and amplifying nearly every marketing activation.”[8]"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-14T02:37Z,"Sports marketing

Marketing activation techniques are commonly used in sports marketing. They are often associated with a brand sponsoring an athlete or an event in order to boost their brand awareness. It has been said that “with strong marketing activation and creativity, consumers should remember the sponsor’s campaign”[9]
[edit]
What it is not

Even though marketing activation encompasses most marketing activities a firm will execute, some approaches, in the fields of communication and customer service, may not qualify as marketing activation. For example “public relations may be viewed as broad communication operation rather than a sharp marketing activation.”[10]"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
 Jump to: navigation, search 

A brand community is a community formed on the basis of attachment to a product or marque. Recent developments in marketing and in research in consumer behavior result in stressing the connection between brand, individual identity and culture. Among the concepts developed to explain the behavior of consumers, the concept of a brand community focuses on the connections between consumers. A brand community can be defined as an enduring self-selected group of actors sharing a system of values, standards and representations (a culture) and recognizing bonds of membership with each other and with the whole. Brand communities are characterized in shared consciousness, rituals and traditions, and a sense of moral responsibility.[clarification needed]

The term ""brand community"" was first presented by Albert Muniz Jr. and Thomas C. O'Guinn in a 1995 paper for the Association for Consumer Research Annual Conference in Minneapolis, MN. In a 2001 article titled "" Brand Community"", published in the Journal of Consumer Research (SSCI), they defined the concept as ""a specialized, non-geographically bound community, based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand."" This 2001 paper recently has been acknowledged by Thomson Scientific & Healthcare to be one of the most cited papers in the field of economics and business.

Many brands provide examples of brand communities. In computers and electronics: Apple Inc. (Macintosh, iPod, iPhone), Holga and LOMO cameras, and Palm and Pocket PC Ultra-Mobile PCs. In vehicles: Ford Bronco, Jeep, Miata, Mini Cooper, Saab, Saturn and Subaru automobiles, and Royal Enfield and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In toys: Barbie and Lego.

,jerrykk08,2012-08-14T02:39Z,"1990–2000: ""A new kind of car company""

Saturn S-Series

In July 1990, GM Chairman Roger Smith and UAW President Owen Bieber drove the very first Saturn off the assembly line in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The brand was marketed as a ""different kind of car company,"" and Saturn operated outside the GM conglomerate, with its own assembly plant in Spring Hill, unique models and a separate retailer network.

Results at Saturn were mixed. According to The Wall Street Journal, the project was too ambitious, as ""everything at Saturn is new: the car, the plant, the workforce, the dealer network and the manufacturing process. Not even Toyota, everyone's candidate for the world's best automaker, tackles more than two new items on any single project."" While Saturn cars proved very popular with buyers, actual sales never met the optimistic projected targets, in part because of a recession in 1990. It also proved cannibalistic as 41% of Saturn buyers already owned a GM car. Its separation from the rest of its GM parent, plus the fact that it drained $5 billion from other car projects, stirred resentment within GM ranks. Also, Saturn opened at considerably higher cost than the Japanese transplants (factories that Japanese automakers established in the United States). [7][8]

Nonetheless, the brand was immediately known for its ""no haggle"" prices. The first Saturn model, the S-Series, was significantly successful. A year later, Saturn hit the Canadian market. 499,999 Saturns later, ""Carla"" entered the market in 1993. In May 1995, ""Jasper"", Saturn's Millionth car is produced. In 1996, Saturn Dealerships distributed the electric General Motors EV1, the first car released under the GM marque. In 1997, Saturn became the first General Motors North American vehicle to be fully built with right-hand-drive on the same assembly line as the left-hand-drive vehicles (the previous right-hand-drive GM North American vehicle were built in the countries with left-hand road rule using the CDK kit and customised dashboard and steering components) as it entered the Japanese market. In January 1999, Saturn rolled out its two millionth car. Later that year, Saturn began production of its all new L-Series.

Saturn L-Series
[edit]
2000–08: model expansion

Saturn's first compact crossover SUV was introduced for the 2002 model year as the Vue, based on a globally used GM design. For 2003, Saturn introduced the Ion as a replacement to the S-Series. For 2005, Saturn began selling the Relay, a minivan and the first Saturn based on similar models from other GM brands. That same year, the L-Series was discontinued. The Sky roadster was introduced in 2006 as a 2007 model. Also for 2007, the Aura midsize sedan made its way to dealerships, alongside the Outlook, a larger CUV than the Vue, and was the last year the Ion was produced. The Ion was replaced by the European-built Astra in 2008. During the 2008 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), Saturn revealed its Flextreme concept vehicle, which was a rebadged Opel Flextreme.[6]

In 2004, GM and the United Auto Workers dissolved their unique labor contract for the Spring Hill manufacturing plant, allowing Saturn operations to be integrated with the rest of GM.[9]"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-14T02:39Z,"2008–09: attempt to sell brand, market changes

In US Congressional hearings on December 2, 2008, General Motors announced its intentions to focus on four core brands (Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, GMC), with the sale, consolidation, or closure of Saturn and the remaining brands (Pontiac, Hummer, and Saab).[10] General Motors Chairman and former CEO Rick Wagoner announced during a news conference on February 17, 2009 that Saturn will remain in operation through the end of the planned lifecycle for all Saturn products (2010–11).

In February 2009, GM declared its intent to part with this brand by closing or selling the division, either to investors or to dealers, as part of restructuring plans dependent upon the receipt of a second round of government loans (""bailout"" funding).[11] It is the third such action for GM in the 21st century, following those of Oldsmobile, which ceased production in 2004, and Pontiac, which ended production of the 2010 model year by the end of 2009.[12]

General Motors announced in June 2009 that it was selling the brand to Penske Automotive Group.[13] The arrangement was similar to the deal under which Penske distributes Daimler AG's Smart Car in the United States.[14] Penske was not planning to buy the factories and would eventually have to contract other car companies to build cars sold as Saturns. GM would have built the Aura, Vue, and Outlook for Penske for two years. To replace GM as the brand's manufacturer, Penske was in discussions with several global automakers, including Renault Samsung Motors of Korea.[15]	Wikinews has related news: Penske Auto selected to buy General Motors' Saturn unit


By the end of 2009, GM closed all of its 46 Saturn dealerships in Canada, even for Saturn dealerships also selling Saab vehicles. GM and Penske decided that they could no longer make a business case to distribute Saturn vehicles in Canada after the sale of the brand. Saturn's customer service, parts, and warranty operations will move to other GM dealerships in Canada.[16]
[edit]
2009: sale falls through

On September 30, 2009, Penske terminated its discussions with GM to acquire its Saturn subsidiary. The tentative agreement was for GM to continue to produce the Saturn line until 2011; after that time, an undisclosed third company would assume production responsibilities. Penske's decision to back out of the sale came after an undisclosed company's board rejected plans to take over production of the Saturn line.[17] The undisclosed ""company"" was later reported to be the Renault-Nissan alliance, reacting mainly to objections from the latter.[18] Subsequently, GM stated they will shut down the division and dealers would have to close by October 2010.[19] Since that date Saturn vehicles have been serviced at other GM dealerships.[17]

Meanwhile, the Outlook was the last Saturn to be produced, although it is unknown when production ended. Although all Saturn production ended October 2009, only the Outlook resumed from hiatus by February 2010 for production.

In February 2010, as a means of customer retention, GM announced it was offering existing Saturn owners up to US$2,000 in incentives on purchasing a new Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick or GMC vehicle until March 31. Customers were required to have owned their Saturns for at least six months and were not required to trade them in to be eligible for the incentives.[20]

Saturn Authorized Service Providers have been introduced since the closing of the Saturn brand. Most Saturn Authorized Service Providers are at Cadillac and Chevrolet dealers. Saturn Authorized Service Providers are responsible for all aspects of service, including warranty service, on Saturn vehicles."

[edit]
Earlier models

Originally, the company's products used a dedicated platform called the Z-body and a dedicated engine, the 1.9 L Saturn I4 engine, and a dedicated plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. All of the original Saturns featured dent-resistant plastic body panels which were also touted as allowing the company to change the look of the vehicles readily. However, in practice, the company did not often take advantage of this capability.

Saturn S-Series cars were produced from 1991–2002. There were 3 Generations of S-Series Cars. First Generation S-Series cars were produced from 1991–1994. For the 1995 Model year, Saturn implemented a ""First Generation"" exterior, and ""Second Generation"" interior. The exterior of the 1995 model year looked the same as the first generation cars, but exhibited larger gauge faces on the instrument cluster, and a redesigned middle console. First Generation engines were rated at 85 horsepower (63 kW) for the Single Overhead Cam Engines, while the Dual Overhead Cam Engines were rated at 124 horsepower (92 kW) for the entire run of S-Series cars (1991–2002). In 1996, the Second Generation S-Series Sedan was introduced and remained virtually unchanged for the rest of the vehicle's production run. In 1997, the Second Generation of the Sport Coupe model was introduced with a more ""scooped"" headlight front. The 1999 Coupe models received a suicide door behind the driver side door. The S-Series was produced in three variations: Coupe (SC), Sedan (SL), and Wagon (SW). The Wagon was introduced for the 1993 Model year and was produced until 2001.

The first real change came with the 2000 Saturn L-Series mid-size car. It shared the GM2900 platform with the Opel Vectra, along with its engine, and was built at a GM factory in Wilmington, Delaware. In 2003, the Saturn Ion replaced the S-Series compact.

The market did not respond well to these models. Ion production lines were halted for two weeks in 2003 to allow dealer inventory to reduce. The L-Series was canceled after production of the 2005 models, and the Ion was canceled after 2007.


[edit]
Final model line

 2009 Saturn Vue

As of 2009, all Saturn models used common GM platforms and engines. The plastic body panels, which were previously touted as a company trademark, had been discontinued.

The 2009 Saturn models were the Sky roadster, the Aura sedan, the Astra hatchback, the Vue small crossover SUV and the Outlook full-size crossover SUV built off the GM Lambda platform.[21]

Some of the final Saturns were virtually identical to certain European Opel/Vauxhall models. For example, the 2008 Saturn Vue was a rebadged Opel Antara, while the Opel GT was based on the Saturn Sky. The Opel Astra was imported from Antwerp, Belgium as the Saturn Astra. On the other hand, the Saturn Aura, while based on the same platform as the Opel Vectra, is a unique model for the North American market similar to the Pontiac G6.

The company offered two sub-lines of vehicles: ""Red Line"" Saturns are performance-oriented, while ""Green Line"" cars are more environmentally friendly hybrids.[22] The Vue and Ion Red Line models, launched in 2004, have been joined by Vue and Aura Green Lines for the 2007 model year and a Sky Red Line the same model year. Saturn's Green Line vehicles utilize mild hybrid technology.[23"
