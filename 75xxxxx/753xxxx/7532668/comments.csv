,Hotnuke,2012-08-22T02:32Z,"I truly pity you, gramranger. Detachment is one of the most powerful, life-changing films I've seen in over a decade. The fact you think it's garbage shows you're as detached as they come. Again, I PITY YOU!"
,milan_82,2012-09-08T18:52Z,"Couldn't have said it better myself, Hotnuke. It is sheer ignorance to claim that this movie is ""god awful"". It saddens me that people, like gramranger, have become so disconnected from reality. Without cgi, explosions, violence and gore, there is not enough stimulation for the simple mind. This movie was a breath of fresh air after years of repetitive, unoriginal garbage."
