this is a Bootable Disk WinPE *ISO*

NOT

the software install people normally use.
this is the 3rd build to this version uploaded fairly recently and sadly no one has the regular windows install.

I havn't downloaded any of the boot disc images so i can not vouch for their quality in any way.

Paragon makes good HDD software though"
