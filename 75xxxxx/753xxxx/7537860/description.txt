This study of the FINDER police information sharing system provides evidence to support all-crimes information fusion and analysis as a path to improved public safety and homeland security. Examining more than 1,500 users and 1.8 million system events over a fifteen-month period, Scott demonstrates that information sharing produces performance and efficiency gains for law enforcement. Scott looks at the IT user level for the highly contextual influences on successful outcomes and relevant information system metrics. Objective system use and user-level performance measures are combined with user perception data to produce empirical models establishing performance metrics. These models identify technology, user, and environmental factors that can be employed to predict the productive use of police data shared between disparate records management systems.
