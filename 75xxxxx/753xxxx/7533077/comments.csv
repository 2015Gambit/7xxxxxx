,SigmaLord,2012-08-16T13:32Z,"I downloaded this file, seem activator is not work...that letters and number from ""Info hash"" - serial number? or what?"
,fpr8653,2012-08-16T18:50Z,"I use this activation all the time, I just removed Microsoft office 2010 and reinstalled and used this version and it works perfectly, make sure your antivirus is completely turned off and all security measures otherwise it detects it as a virus and doesn't let it activate, I found this out after finding it quarantined, hope this works for you :)"

,liuswhit,2012-08-21T00:55Z,"thanks for the activator!
also if anyone is looking to download the full version of ms office 2010 i got mine from smart&lol&.com/share&.php (delete the three & symbols in the link for the link to work)  
would really recommend,  works like a charm :)"
,Shanliang,2012-08-28T19:06Z,"Works perfectly. Don't forget to run it as Administrator.

Basic steps:

1. Click on Activation Office 2010 VL

2. If a KMS emulator is already installed, it will automatically activate Office. If not, it gives you the option to install it and then it will activate Office.

That's it."
,nickie1801,2012-09-07T19:32Z,is it working also after 180 days?  or has it then be re-activated with the same activator?
,nickie1801,2012-09-07T19:34Z,is this activator working also after 180 days? or has it be to re-activate every 180 days?
