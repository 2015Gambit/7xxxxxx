,twijjit,2012-08-17T02:06Z,"hey, thanks for the props, and many thanks for the upload! PS: Would love to know what equipment you use for this - would love to be able to grab the chunks of missing episodes (mostly from S09) that are apparently still being aired on TruTV, but can't seem to find anywhere online.."
[T],xgimpyx,2012-08-17T08:22Z,"Hey twijjit and siminator101,
I thought since you both had some questions I would start an IRC channel if either of you or anyone else wanted to pop in and chat. At least it's real time and we won't have lots of comments back and forth on here. I created it on ""IRCHIGHWAY"" network and called it #tvcapchat. Since I just created it I'm in there all by myself at the moment so drop on by. If you have any questions about getting on IRC just leave a comment here and I'll try to help you get connected. :) :) :)"

[T],xgimpyx,2012-08-22T00:29Z,"Hey twijjit,
I hung around in there a few days and nobody showed up. It was weird hanging out in an empty channel. I'm back and I'll stay put this time. See you there. :)"
