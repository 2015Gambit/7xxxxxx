,jahden4,2012-08-16T02:12Z,Is this really working?
,deffas1011,2012-08-16T05:09Z,"Its legit. Very watchable copy. Best so far. Video is  a bit below R5 but far better than cam. Audio is decent. A little muffled and loud at times. Overall good copy.. I rate it V/7 A/6.5. Theres a couple instances, one right at the beginning, where you see the shadow of someone walking to their seat but it never blocks the screen for long. Thanks for this"

,george1052,2012-08-16T23:40Z,"Hey guys, I'm certainly not one to complain since I've been able to view tons of movies at no cost but most of these Total Recall uploads are reading 1hr 45mins long. On the actual website (plus a friend that went to see the movie confirmed) that the movie is actually 2hr 15mins. I usually give 5-6mins to the end credits but even if that were the case with this particular upload, there's still 25mins missing. Again, I'm not complaining!!! Other helpful comments have helped me in the past so I thought I'd just return the favor."

,endlessnights44,2012-08-17T03:40Z,It's only 1 hour & 58 minutes with the credits.
