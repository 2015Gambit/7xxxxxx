The mysterious Order of the Dragon has their new champion, one to replace Dracula in their timeless tale of horror, violence and love tragically lost. But as forces and narratives converge and the final chapter is almost complete, will Vampirella be more agreeable to that fate than Dracula proved to be? And as timelines collapse and the two vampire titans prepare for one, final showdown, what sort of world... which manner of legend... will be left for the winner to inherit? The epic series of myths, monsters, muses and mysteries concludes!
