    [Notes]

    Last summer, over a span of six days, Incubus celebrated their 20th
    anniversary as a band by renting out a gallery in downtown Los Angeles to
    perform and connect with their fans in the most intimate of settings. The
    band documented this unique experience on high-quality video and stunning
    audio, making up the much-anticipated release, INCUBUS HQ LIVE.
