Well since I had success with my first upload I thought I'd give
another more substantial file a go. Never seen this movie on here
and quite frankly everyone deserves to have seen it.

Cracking movie, I may have pee'd myself a little when I watched it.

If you liked Kung Pow, I'd be surprised if you didn't like this. A
parody of the 1970's Blaxploitation Genre, but done with such affection
for the original format that you have to take your hand off to the guys.


Apologies for my speed, should pick up once people jump on hopefully.
