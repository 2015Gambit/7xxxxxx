,AxDeath,2012-08-14T05:24Z,finally someone posts this stuff up clean and easy.
,augzodia,2012-08-14T06:01Z,You are my hero! It's a real shame demonoid went down but I'm glad you're still around
,friendly_donkey,2012-08-14T16:47Z,"Thanks and, yes, Demonoid's demise is a pretty big loss in the ongoing internet war."
,friendly_donkey,2012-08-14T16:50Z,"It's the fact, for me, at least, that there's no clear alternative to Demonoid. If someone has one, please tell. TPB has some quality checks and has endured the times. But, still, the sense of community isn't the same."
,looperdooper,2012-08-15T01:52Z,your torrents are great as usual. it might just be my media player but theres a sound issue at the 4:00 mark like it was sped up or something. other then that all your adventure time torrents are amazing. keep up the good work.
,AestheticNeox,2012-08-16T01:18Z,"Yeah, I miss Demonoid. If anyone knows a place like it msg me ^^
Or if the site come back with a different name tell me please"
