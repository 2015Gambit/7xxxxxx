,puppyiluv,2012-08-18T19:30Z,"The program works but I'm having some troubles micriches. I left a message, maybe u can help?? Here's the message I left rhalls28: 
The program works, ty rhalls28!! The only trouble I'm having now is because I am new & don't know what I'm doing...hoping you can help. Somehow I feel like contacting customer service with a name ""Oscar Mayer"" might be too fishy lol...well I'm trying to convert these TS video files and merge them into one movie. I tried 3 different movies with 3 different formats in the output ( .mpg .avi and .mp4) all resulting the same toward the end of the conversion, a message reads ""failed to join the video files"". I'm sure I'm doing something wrong..should I convert the many files first, then try to merge or join them???!"
,micriches,2012-08-18T21:21Z,"i dnt know if i understand you perfectly bt i suggest you convert all the video files into one format ..say.mp4    then join them. if you think youd want to try it wwith another video softwware here you go

,puppyiluv,2012-08-18T21:50Z,going to try the same program with your advice to change the format first...now I did read the Ultra Video Joiner help section. I'm not lazy. It does say that you should move files up or down to put them in order...so I was putting them in numerical order by their end times...(there is no numerical order for start times.) Is that right? Or don't I have to move anything? 
,micriches,2012-08-19T00:12Z,"nop, put them in muerical order in order of which you want them to play one after the other wwhen the video is joined together ...hp this helps.."
,puppyiluv,2012-08-19T14:49Z,"sorry if I'm bugging u micriches- u have been awesome to help me this far, but well I went to check out yahoo's questions and answers to see if I was missing something and two people say you have to download K-Lite Codec Pack first or nothing will work. I'm going to try that next and see if that does the trick! I shall return to tell u once I master this thing lol, if I don't crash my puter that is "
