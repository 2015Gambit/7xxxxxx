Legit, clean, no iffy, i ran it to verify. Don't even remember which op group had it up. Oh and by the way kiddies, stupid thing to setup events on facebooks when you're doing your runs and you publically post it. But thanks to their careless way. Legit copy. Seed, SEED, SEED! I told you i would bring goodies, but only to those who seed my torrents. I spent close to 3 years here working my butt off to find the hard to find, unknowns and wanted when no one had legits. Total love kiddies...N2KMaster.

PS - My birthdays friday...:P
