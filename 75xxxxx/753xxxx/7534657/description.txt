Here is a torrent for the documental movie La Educaci√≥n Prohibida, which covers the state of education nowadays on several Latinamerican countries. Subtitles are available in English. For more info, visit www.educacionprohibida.com.

I uploaded it because it was just released and the servers were getting strained out :).

The movie is free to download. If you like it, consider collaborating with the project and, of course, spreading the word :)

Happy sharing!
