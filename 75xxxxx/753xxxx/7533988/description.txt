NO or lack of comments I'll take as 
"You did not like the quality"
"You did not like the series"
"You have no manners"

I put a lot of effort into my TVrips
Unlike most posted TVrips my BBC rips have full endings
I don't like squashed credits with announcer talk-over
I fix this before posting, so mine are more like DVDrips than TVrips

Human senses are not well adapted for life in the dark so it's not surprising that we are not familiar with what goes on when the sun goes down. 

The opportunity to be a presenter on a TV expedition to South America is one that few biologists would pass up. But The Dark: Nature's Nighttime World would be even more challenging, as most of the filming would be done at night. 

Recent advances in thermal and infrared imaging make it possible to get a real idea of what nocturnal creatures are doing without altering their behaviour.
