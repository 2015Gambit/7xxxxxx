Seriously, stop using MKV. It sucks, it isn't compatible with most shit and everyone hates it. Stop. Fucking. Using MKV."

Only goat-fuckers use technology and methods from the past. Go buy some new equipment you cheap fuck. Everyone loves MKV because its the future, you hate it because you're a dumbass. I've got some VHS in the dumpster outside my house, why don't you go jump in there and grab em."

,PurityDeath,2012-09-17T04:19Z,"How is an uncensored roast still censored? Haha.

For Roseanne Barr's roast, Jeff Ross made a joke about Seth Green that was not aired: ""Seth, congratulations. This is actually a great night for you. You haven't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in Aurora... I'm kidding. You are not like James Holmes. At least he did something in a movie theater that people remember!"""
,PurityDeath,2012-09-17T04:21Z,"Side note... A lot of people aren't as fucking pathetic as they're perceived to be... They can take a joke and take shit with a grain of salt, I find it insulting to think they can't.

Unless they're Muslims which then, of course they can't and that is an insult. They insult themselves by being so pathetic."
