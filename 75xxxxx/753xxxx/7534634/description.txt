A Very British Miscarriage Of Justice

The real story behind the conviction of SurfTheChannel┬┤s owner Anton Vickerman

My name is Anton Vickerman and I am the proud owner of the now dead video search engine SurfTheChannel.com (STC). By the time you read this I will be starting my new life behind bars after receiving what is expected to be a ΓÇ£loony sentenceΓÇ¥ from Judge John Evans of Newcastle Crown Court for running my site from 2007 to 2012.


This is story of Anton Vickerman and FACT Ltd, UK regional office of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).

I decided to upload it as torrent to spread the word and make sure that Anton Vickerman words will not dissapear incase FACT Ltd decides to silence the SurfTheChannel.com in order to cover up the truth

The torrent contains:

story.txt - direct copy/paste of Anton Vickerman words on http://surfthechannel.com
misc762.rar - unchanged, unmodified rar archive uploaded by Anton Vickerman, linked on the http://surfthechannel.com
password is miscarriage22.txt - txt to say the password for the archive. Anton Vickerman uploaded the rar passworded and due the rar in this archive is not tampered in any way, it also carries the password

The password for misc762.rar is "miscarriage22" without the quotes.


Spread the word, do not let MPAA and it's affiliates suppress the people and the truth!
