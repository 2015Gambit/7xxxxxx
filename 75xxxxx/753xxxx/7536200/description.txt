You may have heard about comedian Rachel Feinstein from a variety of different places. Formerly she was writer for the humorous fake news site The Onion, as well as Heeb Magazine, a hub for all things Jewish and funny. More recently she was a finalist on season 7 of ΓÇ£Last Comic Standing.ΓÇ¥ Her Comedy Central special premiered in March of this year. On top of performing at various comedy festivals, sheΓÇÖs appeared on ΓÇ£Comics UnleashedΓÇ¥ and the ΓÇ£Just For LaughsΓÇ¥ comedy series on TBS.

FeinsteinΓÇÖs debut album Thug Tears (released in conjunction with Comedy Central Records) is one of the funniest IΓÇÖve had a chance to review since writing for AmericasComedy. Feinstein expertly sets up incredibly awkward and hilarious social situations, and with spot on narration, has her audience rolling. Right away you know nothing is off limits when Feinstein creates a visual of her mother critiquing her dirty talk while Feinstein is getting laid.

In combination with great story-telling skills, Feinstein incorporates a surprising range of voices and characters. From her whorish friends, to a gangster named Trey, you never know whoΓÇÖs sheΓÇÖs going to transform into next.
