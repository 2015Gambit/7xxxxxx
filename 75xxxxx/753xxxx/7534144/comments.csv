The problem is that you try to install first the update package.You must install first the 

Adobe Acrobat X Professional 10.1.4 Multilingual By bobiras2009  Install.msi

and then the update."
,balldinger,2012-08-24T01:07Z,"Cant get either file to activate.  The installer starts but then I get the error:
This installation package could not be opened.  Contact the application vendor to verify hat it is a valid windows installer package.

Using Windows 7 Pro
Any help?"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-25T08:46Z,"@balldinger 

You are sure that you try to install the install exe first?If you try to install the update exe first it will give you this error.First the install exe and then the update exe."
,balldinger,2012-08-25T19:26Z,"@bobiras22

Yes sir, i read blouseopeners comment first and made sure it was the correct one.  Actually both files give me the same error.

I am new at this but the files are MSI files, not exe, which is what, Microsofts new install format??

Thanks!"
,das_rosh,2012-08-27T02:08Z,"Hi I'm having the same problem that blouseopener and balldinger... when I try to run any of the .msi files, I get that window. 

Still thanks for uploading"
,aliplus,2012-08-29T18:45Z,@ all. Having same issue here. Changed compatibility setting but still not working. The setup is corrupted I guess
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-29T19:22Z,"@For All

The files are fine.In windows 7/8 you must run the msi files as admin and it will work.Also check your windows if you have the net framework 3.5 and above installed in your computer.In my windows xp i install it fine.If you do this and still have problem try to redownload the torrent and post here i will help you till you have a perfectly adobe reader program."
,d_wop,2012-09-05T11:50Z,"Same problem for me. 'installer package cannot be opened'. I have .net 2, 3 3.5 and 4 installed. Haven't tried to redownload yet. I'm on a super slow connection and it takes all night..."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-09-06T17:35Z,"@d_wop

If you are in windows 8 try the compatibility options.In windows xp i have installed it many times and work fine.Please try it in windows 7 enviroment/windows 8 with compatibility mode and let me know if works.Also you must run it as administrator(right click and open as administrator in windows 7/8)"

,KuriousJorj,2012-09-12T03:46Z,Same problem as everyone else.  WinXP.  .Net 4.  Can't run either the exe or update or anything.
,rajesh1215,2012-09-12T11:12Z,"ok let me first thanks bobiras for the upload.
Hope my comment helps other.

I also faced similar problems as above. I looked for the solution. Here it is.

thanks MeeMy90  for first solution.

Use 7-zip to extract install file (""Adobe Acrobat X Professional 10.1.4 Multilingual By bobiras2009 Update.msi""), run the setup.

For the patch, 7-zip did not work but it worked with following command

Type following on command prompt, 

msiexec /p ""Adobe Acrobat X Professional 10.1.4 Multilingual By bobiras2009 Update.msi""

that worked for me. hope for others too. bobiras thanks again, but so many having problem that means it has problem, may not be with the uploaded file.
I am gussing some pre-requisite is missing, I did not investigate."
,jersson,2012-09-13T15:57Z,Install is ok but everytime I go on line the serial gets blacklisted so I have to enter a new serial every time I'm using the appl. I think a crack or a patch is the only way to get around this.
