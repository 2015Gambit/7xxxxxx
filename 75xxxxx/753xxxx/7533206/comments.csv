,micron66,2012-08-25T07:16Z,"missing the following song - 

12. The Act Of Darkening"
,micron66,2012-08-25T07:22Z,"ok,just searched and found out out that song no. 12 is actually in the Deluxe edition."
,burnmatt,2012-08-27T06:38Z,"ACTUALLY, I have every Katatonia album and I have seen them live 3 times.

This new album is a watered down REgression compared to the last album and is about as bland as their 2 minute photoshop album cover. I can only hope the next one is better. "
