These sources include his analyst (William Devane), a Massachusetts State Patrol Captain (Stephen McHattie) who has come to also be a comrade, former employees (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth), a Mob kingpin (William Sandler), and even a felon who once saved JesseΓÇÖs life and was the man who originally brought him to Paradise to be the Chief of Police (Saul Rubinek).
