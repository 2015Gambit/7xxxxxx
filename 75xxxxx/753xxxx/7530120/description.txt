This is my first live recording, so please forgive the slight gap at the beginning of Passion in a Pitbull. Candid @ Mac's Bad Art Bar - it was a great show with everyone getting into it. The drinks were cold, the grooves (and woman) were hot and a good time was had by all! Thanks to Mike Spadaro (bass) for giving me an accurate setlist and allowing me to record this show to spread the love!
