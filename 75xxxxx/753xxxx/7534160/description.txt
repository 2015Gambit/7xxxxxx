I can say for a fact this is a superb album no doubt about it.
It is a mix of slow, mellow and a number of fast-paced tracks covering various sounds. Here, youΓÇÖre definitely going to pick out unique nuances of South African and East Africa (Uganda and Kenyan) music intonations.
The album features renditions of widely played and still fresh tunes like, ΓÇ£FeverΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Besame MuchoΓÇ¥. And original, vernacular (Kikuyu) tracks like ΓÇ£Ngugi iiΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Hoi and HoiΓÇ¥ are some of the highlights of this album. Here you can sense the great command of language (this being her native language- Kikuyu) as she belts outs these two incredible tunes to the listenerΓÇÖs appreciation.
Bottom line- this is a well crafted album which has the input of some of the best producers, artists and instrumentalists locally and internationally (Kenya, Uganda and South Africa).
