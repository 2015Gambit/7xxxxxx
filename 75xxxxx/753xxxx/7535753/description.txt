E.A.T.E.R. were formed in the summer of 1982 in Grums/Kil, Sweden... 30 years later they are still going strong.


In 2005 did E.A.T.E.R. became a part of the WWW with www.eater.se. A lot of people asked for the record, Doomsday Troops and we released all recorded songs on the web. 

In 2009 Distortion Records got in touch with them and wanted to release a compilation album, so they got the band together again with a new drummer and a new guitarist.

During the summer of 2010 the band did some gigs, the first one
s in 24 years. The very first one was at the Punk Illegal festival. The band liked the taste of hardcore again and recorded a new EP trough the fall of 2010 and released a new 7ΓÇ¥ in December 2010 with five new songs. 

During the fall of 2011 E.A.T.E.R. went to Amerika with the Doomsday Troops for a two week tour of the North East of the United States! And the story continues...
