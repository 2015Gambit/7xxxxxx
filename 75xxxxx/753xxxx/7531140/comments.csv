,jerith667,2012-08-16T00:00Z,Any way we could get a list of what RPGs are in these?
,retireddeer,2012-08-17T23:40Z,"Jerith667, this is just a tiny database file with more torrents in it. They are sorted alphabetically, so if you double click a torrent file, it will open and allow you to see the contents and select from it."
,Saporn,2012-08-25T01:06Z,Where is the letter G?
,rpgA2Z,2012-08-29T08:50Z,"Sorry, I hadn't noticed there was no ""G.""  You are probably looking for Gamma World or Ghostbusters?  I'll search what I have. "
,Saporn,2012-09-04T09:40Z,"GURPs actually, but Classic GW or GB are good too."
