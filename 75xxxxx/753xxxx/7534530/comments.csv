Where can I find the other files of 1217 cycle for iPad?"
,BigRod43,2012-08-17T01:27Z,"I suspect they will be up soon.
I do not have an IPad so just uploading the files
from disk 1217 needed for the VFR addition and airport list 
for all airports and VFR data."

How about loading the disk/iso 1217 for us?
Thanks"
