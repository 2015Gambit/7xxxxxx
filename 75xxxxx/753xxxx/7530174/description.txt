VMware View is a desktop virtualization solution that helps organizations automate desktop and application management, reduce costs, and increase data security through centralization of the desktop environment.

Written by VMware experts Jason Langone and Andre Leibovici, this book is meant as a guide for architects, solution providers, consultants, engineers and anyone planning to design and implement a solution based on VMware View 5. This book will pull information and expertise from real world scenarios so as to maximize practical learning. It will explain the settings and configurations needed to have a successful desktop virtualization solution as well as the 'why' behind the decisions

This book is not meant to replace the official Administration or Installation Guides for VMware View or ThinApp published by the great people at VMware. The material in this book should be used during the design phase, which is before an implementation is underway. All components of a VMware View solution will be covered.

This book uses case studies from the real world including:

    * Hotel Kiosk: VDI solution used in a hotel lobby to provide basic connectivity to its guests
    * Federal agency with classified and unclassified information: VDI used to allow analysts to securely connect to both a classified and unclassified network from the same device
    * Remote Office: VDI used to provide connectivity to offshore developers
    * Out-of-band Scientist: VDI used to provide a secure desktop environment to scientists fighting disease in remote locales
