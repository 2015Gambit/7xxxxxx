,Kozar33,2012-08-16T22:40Z,"THIS TORRENT CONTAINS A VIRUS, DOWNLOAD ONLY ON YOUR OWN RISK.

IF YOU'VE ALREADY DOWNLOADED THIS TORRENT, USE SOME ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE LIKE MALWAREBYTES OR OTHER (u can google for other, not that hard)."
,anilem,2012-08-17T00:28Z,"@TeamExtremeMc: noep :)
read the news on minecraftforum dot net:
""This is the same version that will be released on Thursday via the normal Minecraft launcher!""

,MageExia,2012-08-21T02:55Z,i want to change the location of the minecraft folder but it is grayed out. I want both your 1.2.5 and 1.3.1. Help Please????
,LStryker,2012-08-26T10:32Z,"@MageExia
You can't change the installation directory because Minecraft can only be run through there. And you can't have both versions at the same time, you need to choose 1.3.2/1.3.1/1.2.5 all works great!
1.3.1:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7494643/Minecraft_1.3.1_Cracked_[Full_Installer]
1.2.5:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7159687/Minecraft_1.2.5_Cracked_[Full_Installer]"

A: Yes, you can.

Q: How can I set up a Server?
A: Load the official Server here or Bukkit Server here.

Q: My Server say on connect ""User not Premium"", why?
A: Open server.properties and set ""online-mode=true"" to ""online-mode=false"".

Q: Can I install Mod's?
A: Yes, it's a unmodified Version, you can install all Mod's.

Q: How can I change my Nickname?
A: Check this picture.

Q: Can I use my normal Premium Account with this Version?
A: Yes, you can.

Q: You are the Minecraft Developers?

,101rjb,2012-08-31T09:02Z,does this have multi player
,Naxell,2012-08-31T13:24Z,How do i change my name?
,Neph_Axel,2012-09-01T15:17Z,"I came to this page from a recommendation by 2 of my friends so I know that the torrent works. However, even though I have already downloaded the latest version of Java (7.0) and have also installed Java 1.5.0 my Macbook (I'm using CrossOver, an application that allows Mac users to run Windows applications), I can't start up the Cracked Minecraft application and it keeps telling me  ""This application requires a Java Runtime Environment 1.5.0."" Any ideas as to what the problem is? Should I remove my Java 7.0 and stick to 1.5.0?"
,Neph_Axel,2012-09-01T15:18Z,PS. What is the link to the facebook group?
,xXNeoREXx,2012-09-01T16:44Z,"This version of 1.3.2 is broken, I downloaded it from the official release website and there is no viruses, but with this release the game crashes a lot!
I recommend sticking to 1.3.1 or trying the [Online] release that is maybe better but I didn't test it."
,miranji,2012-09-03T01:57Z,"THIS IS NOT A VIRUS.
thank you (:"
,Bruunkka,2012-09-04T16:03Z,"Brilliant release as always :-)

Its not whitelisted and no hamachi"
,OneBadBasterd,2012-09-07T23:08Z,Why does the game keeps asking me to resgister my password when i enter a game?
,Henry2o9,2012-09-08T05:01Z,I'm surprised that not much people use the Minecraft Updater from AnjoCaido. Though it does not allow for major customizations.
,KingWorad,2012-09-09T13:45Z,you can play multiplayer but on cracked servers... google it...
,Didi08,2012-09-14T18:20Z,Best game ever!!!!
,smash8229,2012-09-16T02:43Z,"hey, game works and everything and im having a blast, but ive notice when i break up stone or if i find coal and break it up, nothing drops. any fix to this? kinda hard to play without essentials. and its becoming annoying working in the dark and with crappy tools lol."
