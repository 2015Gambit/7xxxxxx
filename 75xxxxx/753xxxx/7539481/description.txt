Electricity Experiments You Can Do At Home is a hands-on guide that helps you master the principles of electrical currents and magnetism. Each of the book's three sections--direct current, alternating current, and magnetism--begins with step-by-step instructions for setting up your lab for the experiments that follow. Using inexpensive, easy-to-find parts, the experiments progress from basic to more complex and will spark ideas and encourage inventiveness. Expect unexpected results when you experiment with:
Diode-based voltage reducer 
Compass-based galvanometer 
Photovoltaic illuminometer 
Utility bulb saver 
Ripple filter 
Xener-diode voltage regulator 
AC spectrum monitor 
Ampere's law with wire loop 
AC electromagnet 
Handheld wind turbine 
And dozens more projects

ELECTRICITY EXPERIMENTS YOU CAN DO AT HOME helps you to:
Solve circuit problems in electricity 
Build practical and interesting electrical and magnetic devices 
Get ideas for science-fair projects 
Prepare for advanced courses in electricity and electronics 
Learn the basics of laboratory practice
