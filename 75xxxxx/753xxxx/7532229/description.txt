Elf Bowling 1

 This is the first episode of a series of popular Elf Bowling games for windows. This one needs no installation and will run on all versions of windows. 
 
 You must first uncompress the zip folder and then you can run the game directly from the extracted folder. This is usually done by right clicking on the zip file and choose "extract all" from the popup menu. You can then create a shortcut to the game on your desktop by right clicking on the game and choose "send to desktop" from the sub menu.

Enjoy the game, leave a nice comment and seed it to others!
