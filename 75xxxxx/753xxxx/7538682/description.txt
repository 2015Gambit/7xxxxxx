THIS HAS ONLY DERRICK JENSEN, ARIC MCBAY, AND THE Q&A SESSION - OTHER SPEAKERS WILL BE UPLOAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

13th November 2011
in Berkeley, CA

Audio ripped from DVDs, edited/cleaned for pauses ("um" or "ahh"), stammers, mis-speaking/self-corrections, ten-second silences, etc.
Then cut by topic and length. Note that these were audio-visual presentations, with slides shown; when mentions of imagery became useless in this format (e.g., "Look at this" or "This fellow here"), this speech was excised.


Will be adding the other speakers as the same clean-up process is done to the audio, and the raw video from the DVDs will follow.
