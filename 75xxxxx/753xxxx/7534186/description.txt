Here is a MS Word Document with the 3 official tests that the South african Department uses.

I think it only has the questions and answers for light motor vehicles (class B).

this doesnt contain pictures of street signs eg: "Sign CC9 is found at a" - you wont know what sign they talking about - but it is common sense and you will recognize the correct one in the exam if you familiarize yourself with the papers.

now if you still fail, ill give you a full refund.. oh wait...



Seed & Enjoy
