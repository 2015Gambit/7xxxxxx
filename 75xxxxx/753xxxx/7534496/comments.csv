,Zizulol,2012-08-24T02:58Z,"Absolutely amazing band, amazing guys. Be sure to support the band by buying the album when it's released! "
,AlastorSX,2012-08-25T23:14Z,I had a feeling this would be up before it even released. Awesome! Gotta love Circa Survive.
,AlastorSX,2012-08-25T23:29Z,Also definitely support the band. Anthony and his wife has gone through enough before finally being blessed with James.
,axl2113,2012-09-03T20:42Z,"thanks to the uploader as always, BUT. this is pretty low quality audio... .flac possible?"
,DevilBloody,2012-09-06T23:54Z,I will see about upgrading the quality when I myself get the chance to buy the real thing. My place a 320kbps or Flac. If you have any bands you want thats the same genre am up for putting the effort to get it.
,indie_guy,2012-09-07T20:50Z,"Not to rain on anybody's parade, but this seems like a reconvert from lower bit-rate. To my sensitive ears it sounds like the cymbals are hissing. Everything on the treble range has slight hiss, which is evidence of low bit-rate. Still, props to the uploader for getting this. Does anyone have a CD rip?"
,DevilBloody,2012-09-08T14:52Z,Wasn't converted on my side. In all honest this was all from youtube since it was first leaked there. I tried to find the best sounding videos but it's definitely not a CD rip.
,indie_guy,2012-09-16T04:56Z,"No prob, DevilBloody, thanks for the release, anywho. A true pirate gentelman."
