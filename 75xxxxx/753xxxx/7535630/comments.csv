,STAY-AT-HOME-GAMER,2012-08-16T08:36Z,THANKS 4 UP
,mal808,2012-08-16T23:28Z,Is the audio as messed up in this one as in the 1.34GB re-encodes?
,mal808,2012-08-17T00:01Z,"To answer my own question... it's almost as bad. I think I'll wait for a version with decent audio to appear before I watch it, none of the copies on here at the moment are worth my time."
,malch,2012-08-17T21:37Z,I agree -- the audio is simply horrible. Such a shame because this looks like a great movie.
,highlander888,2012-08-19T09:59Z,Thanks for the upload but the audio is pretty awful.
,mal808,2012-08-20T06:48Z,"Yes, I should have said thanks too as I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but for me I don't want to ruin a movie with such awful audio. The picture is great however- hopefully soon there will be a better version available..."
