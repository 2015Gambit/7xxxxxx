,frdario,2012-08-15T14:30Z,what the difference between this one and skidrows?
,frdario,2012-08-15T14:32Z,Whats the difference between this release and skidrows?
[T],azaq318,2012-08-15T14:55Z,there is none
,MoD323,2012-08-15T15:10Z,I know that this is limited edition but is this full game I mean it has all chapters included or that is limited too?
,kelvinkeh,2012-08-15T18:50Z,btw i dun think tis is the full version.. ==
,MrMiguelotas,2012-08-15T19:42Z,"Hello, when i try to run the setup it says the the files are corrupted... and i already tried whit administrator... :/"
[T],azaq318,2012-08-15T22:28Z,it seems like you just didn't finish downloading. Check it.
,MoD323,2012-08-16T00:07Z,"OK download is complete, I will seed to you guys, I will tell you tomorrow if it works, but I got good feeling about this, thanks for the upload azaq318 anyway"
,jahden4,2012-08-16T02:15Z,@ mod323 How does the seed works i don't understand why because i am new here
,MoD323,2012-08-16T12:00Z,"@ jahden4 when you download the game for example with ÂľTorrent, when download comes to 100% then the program will start to seed for it self, all you have to do is leave ÂľTorrent running, and as long as it runs it will seed. Hope I helped you."
,Tomy225,2012-08-17T11:41Z,"h i have problem i install the game and when i need to instal all other thinks like direct x net. and that its  error for all and when i start the game they say me ""The program cant start because MSVCP100.dll is missing from your computer."
,MoD323,2012-08-17T15:21Z,"@ Tomy225 - I installed the game, and it is working for me without any problems (only thing that I didn't found solution for is resolution).Anyway, try to install those things manually. Navigate to folder where you installed the game and then go to folder name Redist. Open that folder and install everything expect UbisoftGameLauncher. Hope that helped"
,Sistema112,2012-08-18T01:55Z,"Doesn't works... When I click in the aplication, nothing happens."
,sabatokian,2012-08-20T02:42Z,"i downloaded and installed it correctly. the gameplay is good, runs smoothly, but it has a weird graphic glitch, characters and environment in game are full of holes and weird long spikes
i have no idea what that is"
,MoD323,2012-08-20T15:19Z,"@ sabatokian - well I passed the game without any problems and I never saw any graphic glitches. Did you installed latest direct x and GPU driver, maybe that can solve the problem. What is your rig btw?"
,sabatokian,2012-08-20T16:53Z,"@ MoD323 - i'm sure i have the latest direct x, gpu driver i updated a few months ago... my rig - 4Gb memory, intel dual core 2Ghz, ATI radeon Hd 4300 series. maybe too slow?"
,Noxilum,2012-08-20T20:53Z,"Very good torrent, works perfectly but I got 2 problems : I can't change the controls (I have to swap AZERTY from QWERTY, well not a problem) et you say that it's a multi8 languages but I don't see how you can change it to french or spanish as there are only deutsch or english as languages for the installation."
,maxis1,2012-08-20T20:57Z,the graphic spiky thing is a web frame/ directX problem either overall or just in game install.....have not play this yet but thats normally the problem 
,sabatokian,2012-08-20T23:12Z,"@ maxis1 - ok, thanks, now i know at least where is the problem, but how do i solve it?
i updated the directx, drivers for gpu and reinstalled the game, but it didn't get any better"
,MoD323,2012-08-20T23:41Z,"@ sabatokian - you got Ati 4xxx series, I got 4870, if you got 12.6 driver (latest for now) well that driver is nothing but trouble, I had it and it performed terrible to me so I rollbacked to 12.4 and I got my old good performance back, I don't know maybe just I had that problem but I don't know for sure. My advice is to rollback or wait for a new driver with fixes and stuff, but I don't want to stay on 4xxx series anymore I am looking for upgrade anyway."
,dong00,2012-08-24T14:05Z,"@azaq318, update 1 already out.. how to install in this? thanks.."
,bboy143,2012-09-01T03:07Z,How can I use the DLC?
