The first Paris album has the Zep influence. The second (Big Towne 2061) is closer to what Bob's solo records would turn out to be. More like his Fleetwood Mac songs. Both albums were WAY before their time."

Yes, I agree. The first was heavier than the 2nd.
My band used to perform Black Book and Beautiful Dreamer in the early 80s.
