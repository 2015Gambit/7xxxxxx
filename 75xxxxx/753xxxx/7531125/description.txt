IMMERSE is over the 120ms oos from 29:31-29:40 then slowly
corrects itself. Also, their rls looks like pixelated shit
due to use of homemade ivtc tool. We also know its the
same fios source used. This shit really has to stop, if
the output of a homemade tool cannot produce the same
output of an avisynth encode. It should not be allowed.
Compair the first 20s of these two releases and they are
at crf18 vs our crf19. Shouldn't their release look better
since it is the same source?

We will soon start propering every release they do if
others agree to nuke their bullshit. Then maybe they will
move toward actually preing avisynth looking releases.
Please let us know if and when you will comply.
