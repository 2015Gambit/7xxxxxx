,decemberbrain,2012-08-17T22:24Z,Norton says ElbyCDIO.dll is a threat.
,alphamale007,2012-08-17T22:40Z,"AVG does too. However I got the same warning on 7060 too. I disabled av whilst doing the install and copying the .dll file. Once done reactivated av and all is good so far. So as far as I am concerned the threat is a false positive.
Thanks for the up Ching_Liu, much appreciated."
,RebelRick,2012-08-18T05:45Z,"Thanks for this.Works great and is an awesome program.AnyDVD + DVD Shrink =GREAT QUALITY. I scanned the AnyDVD program folder after copy and pasting the ElbyCDIO.dll and this complete torrent file with Norton AV 2012 and no threats found. So decemberbrain, I want some of what you are smokin!"
,Darth_Adversor,2012-08-18T23:49Z,"I NEVER download from un-trusted/non-VIP uploaders, but I rolled the dice this time.  This is the ONLY version of AnyDVD HD I could find on TPB that worked (The Hunger Games BD).

Norton did not give me any warnings about any of the files.  So hopefully I'm good to go.  

Thanks very much uploader."

I am having trouble trying to copy the hunger games. I have this version of AnyDvd and DVDshrink. Would you mind giving me a quick run through of what you did? Much appreciated!"
,Godsboy5,2012-08-22T07:19Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!

It worked like a charm with ""The Hunger Games"" when all other programs I had to decode the DVD failed miserably!!

I used anyDVD to take off the copy protection of ""The Hunger Games"", and I used DVDfab to copy it. However, there was a glitch with DVDfab, and anyDVD both running at the same time.  However, if after DVDfab has copied it to your computer, and asking for you to put in a writeable DVD, all you have to do is exit anyDVD and it will write to the DVD just fine."
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-08-22T18:47Z,Thanks ChingLiu! I'm aware of your good work elsewhere. I trust you. I don't normally use AnyDVD (just DVDFab) but came looking for a way to copy The Hunger Games DVD and also appreciate the helpful comments by others here. I'll try Godsboy5's suggestion if necessary. Keep up the good work!

,h2freeek,2012-08-24T10:37Z,"Hmm, seems that this version doesn't like the US Hunger Games bluray. I can play it in Corel WinDVD 2010, but I can't rip to image, and when I look at the log it says there's an error. That's disappointing."

That is because your anti-virus program deleted the file before you could access it. Disable or uninstall your anti-virus then re-download and complete the install procedure."
,gyaradon,2012-08-30T20:51Z,Thanks. This version really works (unlike several previous versions that only worked for DVDs.)
,Sninja15,2012-08-31T01:30Z,Does anyone know how it is that this file is used?
