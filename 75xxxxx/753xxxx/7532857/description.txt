This is a fix for a broadcast screwup (this means every encode will exhibit increased volume in the left channel and the right channel is completely missing for the first half of the show).

The fix is to copy the left channel to the right and reduce the volume about 20%. What you'll notice (especially for headphones) is the transition from mono to stereo at the half way point. Specifically:

@20:03 - you hear "cut to black", it cuts to black and viola ... stereo returns.

If you are patient, I'm sure there will be a WEB-DL soon.

Until then ... this will have to do.
