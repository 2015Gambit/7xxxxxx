     Stars: Mel Gibson, Goldie Hawn and David Carradine

   

    Hiding under the FBI witness relocation program, Rick Jarmin (Mel Gibson)
    gets nervous when old flame Marianne Graves (Goldie Hawn) recognizes him.
    But before he can assume a new identity, the man he put in jail
    (David Carradine) is released and comes to pay his respects. Rick and
    Marianne find themselves thrown together on an exhilarating cross-country
    scramble, barely evading the gangsters, police and an amorous veterinarian
    (Joan Severance). Directed by John Badham.
