aCalendar+ is still BETA software - please try the free aCalendar version first!
There are not that many additional features ready yet, but buying aCalendar+ supports development, especially as I can buy some more Android devices for testing.

EXTRA FEATURES (aCalendar+ only)

    Month widget
    NFC sharing (if supported by the device)
    Privacy and availibility settings

Features:

    intuitive navigation with smooth transitions
    day, week & month calendar
    Fullscreen widgets
    flexible recurrences
    birthdays & anniversaries with photos from your addressbook and editing
    uses Android's native calendar backend and synchronization
    no battery drain
    moon phases and zodiac signs for birthdays
    QR barcode sharing of events
    12/24h clock honoring system settings
    optimized text display and improved line-break

PERMISSIONS
On top of the basic calendar and contact permissions also necessary for the free version, aCalendar+ also asks for Internet and NFC. Internet will be used in the future for Google Tasks and potentially other services. aCalendar+ respects your privacy and will NEVER send any of your private data anywhere unless configured by YOU. 'Send Email to guests' is bound to 'write calendar data' by Google.

TRANSLATIONS
aCalendar+ is translated into over 20 languages - please let me know if there is a bad translation somewhere.
