Same as last week:

EVOLVE's release is technically sound but suffers from pixelation during motion and especially scene changes. There is also slight chroma adjustment going on somewhere causing it to sway from the original, which retracts from the intended feel of the show in my opinion. My guesses assuming they are using standard tools, is that the pixelation is caused by a source that is compressed too much from the already mediocre HD stream AMC broadcasts; and the chroma from an IVTC that considers chroma adjustment even though that is unnecessary. I believe this series to be of great quality so I am especially critical of the aforementioned pecularities. Enjoy this internal release if you feel the same. Sample screenshots illustrating the pixelation and chroma are included in the Sample dir.
