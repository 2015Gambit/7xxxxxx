From the Author

The structure of the book is essentially spiral, like a chambered nautilus shell or the pattern in this volume's cover photograph of a Zen garden. By the end of the book, readers will be able to comprehend and accomplish things that seemed shadowy and mysterious when they plunged in at the beginning. Each of the four parts represents a different stage in this quest for skills and understanding.
