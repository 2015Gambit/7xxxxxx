Back in February of 2012, I gave my fiancee a CD with all of the currently approved liturgical readings for the Roman Catholic rite as narrated by me. We're due to be married in a bit less than a month and she has still yet to listen to it, but I figured it might be of use to others, especially those preparing for a wedding who wonder what the readings might sound like versus what's on paper.
