Anyway, the bayimg code (JaBngAAeB in this case) goes in the box when you fill out the upload details, as does ""tt1666278"" in the IMDB field ( full link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666278/ ), for future uploading reference. Other than that, welcome fellow Pirate!"

For everyone who is downloading, I recommend picking up 3-5 chapters and subtitles (if interested in portuguese) so that you can watch it while downloading."
