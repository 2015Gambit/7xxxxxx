 Synopsis:
This double dose of Filipino horror films -- with a clever connection -- serves up specters and scares galore. In Uyayi, young nightshift nurse Melissa (Anne Curtis) and her reporter beau (Marvin Agustin) investigate after the death toll at the hospital suddenly spikes. Salamin stars Kristine Hermosa as Angel, who moves with her cash-strapped family into a suspiciously low-rent house, where she inadvertently opens a gateway to the spirit world.
