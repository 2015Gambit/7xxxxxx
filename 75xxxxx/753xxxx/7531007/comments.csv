When sync goes out you can hit ""j"" & 
""k"" to increase or decrease the audio timing. I found that hitting k 5 times to get it to a 250ms delay lined it up perfect."

Plus the audio gets gradually more and more out of sync so you have to change it several times.

Should just upload a file that works."
