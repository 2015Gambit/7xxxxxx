Ubehage's EasyBoot for XP
-------------------------

This is a small application, made for 1 purpose only: Provide an easy and fast ShutDown-menu for Windows XP.
It works well with all versions of Windows, from 2K and up. But is purposedly made for XP.

This application will display a simple menu, allowing you to choose your action.
It's really that simple.

I recommend you make a shortcut to this application on your Quick Launch-bar.
Or whatever you prefer :)
