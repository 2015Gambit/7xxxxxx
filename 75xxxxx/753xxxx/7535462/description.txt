Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, August 15 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with John Rocker, the retired American Major League Baseball relief pitcher who played for the Atlanta Braves and other teams. Rocker writes a column for WorldNetDaily. He talks with Alex about the airport Gestapo, the TSA, and other topics. John Rocker's autobiography is Scars and Strikes. 

Alex also talks with pharmacist Ben Fuchs about the plague of illness ravaging the nation due to lack of proper nutrition. Fuchs hosts a nationally syndicated radio show, The Bright Side, on Genesis Communications Network [and a business partner in infowarsteam.com]. Hour 3 and the 5 minute "overdrive" segment are largely an infomercial for the products sold at infowarsteam.com. There was so much of that I did not try to edit it. Make your own decision regarding listening.
