This is a ripped version of eec_ash's post (all thanks to eec_ash). This post is about 20% the size of that one but *THAT ONE* includes coloring sheets, mp3's, and more.

Still, if your kids like GiggleBellies and you want a quick xvid download, here it is.

I had a previous one (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6626615/TheGiggleBellies_xvid.avi) but the sound was out of sync. This one is much better (plus better resolution, but larger file size).
