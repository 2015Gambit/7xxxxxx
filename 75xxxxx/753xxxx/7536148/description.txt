Eureka the Butcher is the moniker under which Marcel Rodriguez-Lopez makes what I like to call psychedelic funk hop.

This torrent contains the five songs Marcel has made, which have only been released through his Soundcloud page.

I simply recorded the streams from his Soundcloud to the FLAC format, then converted the FLAC files to MP3 so I can bump this shit on my ipod.

Hope you love it as much as i do!
