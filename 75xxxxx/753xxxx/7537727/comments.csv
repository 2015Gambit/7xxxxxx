,Hajeil,2012-08-17T01:14Z,I see you hitting and running. Seed it back at least once people. It's only a 75mb file for crying out load. xD

,hellraizer2k56,2012-08-17T03:43Z,When i try to save it come up with an error? anyway to get around this?
,Mayonegg,2012-08-17T04:54Z,"Just a guess, but try running the game as an administrator."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-17T07:27Z,"Just right-click the setup and ""Run as Administrator"" if you cannot get the game to work. If the game STILL does not work, then:
1. Right-click the game.
2. Click on properties at the bottom
3. Go to the compatibility tab
4. Check the box, Run as Administrator, at the bottom
5. Just normally click the game and voila!
I had problems running the game smoothly, as well as I could not figure out how to get the Menu open. Just hit the V button on the keyboard. I plugged in the 360 controller into my laptop with it running and it let me use it easily. Going to options and turning off the V Sync helped, as well as smoothing out the menu and turning off the character emboss shadows too.
Nippon Ichi are amazing when it comes to RPGs and this game is no exception! Thanks Hajeil! =)

P.S. I can run some games smoothly in the lowest settings on my 1.6 GHz processor, but you actually need a dual core for this game to run great, it runs decently for me."
,Pie260,2012-08-17T13:55Z,Thank you Magic_friendly now it saves the game and settings just fine.
,baldwinz,2012-08-21T15:59Z,"This torrent has a trojan.
It's not a false-positive as it reamed my system shortly after install and had to re-image.
The game works, but not worth the hassle."
,Hajeil,2012-08-22T09:23Z,@baldwinz There is no trojan in this release. If you got a trojan you didn't get it from here. I've scanned it with multiple AV and malware programs and the results came up 0. I've even installed it and nothing bad has come of it.
,squash34,2012-08-25T14:23Z,"ignore baldwinz.

he probably works for the riaa or the mpaa.

he's a liar.

people like him going around claiming there are trojans/etc. in torrents.

all the money they win from harassing regular people who don't have the resources to defend themselves in court go towards hiring pieces of TRASH like this idiot who go around lying.

mpaa, riaa: you lose. you will always lose. forever :)"
