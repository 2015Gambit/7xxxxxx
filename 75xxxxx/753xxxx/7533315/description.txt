A good quality DVD Rip of Van Morrison's fantastic live performance of Astral Weeks at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009.

Also added are the extras, some interview bits... see how this fantastic musician is a bit of a dickhead... aah well, we can forgive him for taking himself a bit too seriously, can't we?
