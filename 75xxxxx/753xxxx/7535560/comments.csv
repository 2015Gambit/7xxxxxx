[V],bigbluesea,2012-08-16T14:18Z,"@supagran2

1)Download and Install ""utorrent' Bittorrent Client.if you don't have it.Google it


2)After you have it installed come back to this page or my other ebook floods and click on""Get This Torrent"" this will start the ""utorrent"" app

3) Once ""utorrent"" starts there will be a smaller window that also appears.On the lower left hand corner of this small window will be a button with little arrows on it .Click on that button and the window will expand give it a little time to load all the books in the list once that is done you simply choose what books you want or don't want by ticking them off  in the little box next to the title"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-08-16T14:21Z,"@supagran2

One more thing when you finish click ""ok"" and it will start the download :)"
,lynfree,2012-08-16T14:50Z,"thanks a lot BBS. I especiallyy like the Kerry Greenwood titles. Any chance of her Corinna Chapman titles? I have bought the books, but would like to add them to the reader, if I can.
I, too would like to know how to download individual titles rather than the whole flood.Thanks again."

Thanks all the same from all my heart."
[V],bigbluesea,2012-08-18T18:20Z,"@supagran2

Ok,from what I understand not all ""utorrent"" clients have this function.The one that does and enables you to choose the files you want is 

""utorrent 3.2(build 27708)""

You can get it here

http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=8057

I don't use utorrent but I know that the version I mentioned above is the one that has the option to choose the files you want to download.

To check the version you have open utorrent and click on ""Help"" then on ""About"" and it will tell you the version that's installed

Let me know how it goes"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-08-18T18:34Z,"@assour

I do have a couple of his books on hand,I will see if I can get more.They will be in my ""Book Flood # 17"" that I will upload most likely tomorrow"

,supagran2,2012-08-19T13:48Z,Hi BBS i did all that you mentioned on here .i un installed utorrent got the older version 3.2build 27708 and its exactly the same as the version i was using .still no button with arrows ..thankyou for trying to help its much appreciated ...
,guard42,2012-08-19T13:56Z,"supagran2

[V],bigbluesea,2012-08-19T16:15Z,"@guard42
