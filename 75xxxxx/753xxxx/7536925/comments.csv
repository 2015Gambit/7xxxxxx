20 wasted already 

and 34 of those seeders are fakes

peer block 1.1. people it will help"
,1rontorr,2012-08-16T13:17Z,"I have never understood, what is leeching downloading with uploading blocked?
   I have a lot of problems with getting stuck at under 50%, cause I have usually 5-10kbs downloads, so I seed for a long time, and don't delete for a few days after I watch, unless I am running out of storage."
,1rontorr,2012-08-16T13:18Z,"I forgot to say thanks, where are my manners, I do like your uploads"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T13:37Z,"i will have to slow this down a bit now as sedeed 100 percent

as got more torrents to seed out now"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T13:41Z,"leeching is when someone doesnt share back what they grabbed as they are getting it
some limit upload speed to a crawl
so what happens is they get more of the file
then share

this is really a main problem with a torrent is first added and has one real seeder

people like that need to stay off a torrent

so if you have slow upload speed your better to stay of it and wait for 20 seeders

normally can check that in utorrent under the peers tab and see how many really say 100 percent and make sure the download and upload tabs so activity

a peer is someone with part of the file who also share their chunks they have

a seeder is a peer thats got 100 percent of the file"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T13:45Z,":O hope that clears it up?

a block is a blocked ip... it can happen if they add you to the utorrent ipfilter or use peer block

peer block tries to block known hostiles from connecting and seeing and logging your full activity

but more crucial it block the bad people dfrom sharing fake data with you slowing it down and wasting bandwidth

check you torrent tab summary you can see how much is wasted data.. meaning the data was damage you got

without peer block 1.1 (its free soft) google it
that waste can be very high
just load level 1 p2p ips if install it"
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T13:50Z,"wasted data can also happen if you drop connection and the person sending you a chunk of data is gone

or if someone hits and runs while sharing you a chunk but wasted hopefully will be very small amount or 0.."
