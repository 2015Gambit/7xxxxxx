,fejop,2012-08-15T13:52Z,"Kind of lame to not mention that there are hardcoded subs (Which there seems to be), especially when they aren't even in English. "

It is a BIT cropped.. to take out the chinese hardcoded subs.. but it's not even noticable and I watched this on a 60"" Flat Screen TV.... 

Movie did suck pretty bad though.. I mean it was ok. Just glad I didn't spend money to go see it in the movie theater lol"
,shutie10,2012-08-16T08:08Z,"It says the avi file is broken and that I have to fix it... its been ""fixing"" for over an hour now. Has this happened to anyone else?"
,ShrikeStar,2012-08-16T10:59Z,"A9/V9...Great movie and after about 5 mins you dont even notice the subs, granted its not a copy to keep and burn but it will more than do till the offical release. Good job buddy thanks alot"

,ungraph,2012-08-16T16:08Z,"a/v: 7/8. 

This was more of a comedy than a horror film. Lots of symbolism."
,sokroker,2012-08-16T19:13Z,Korean subs get in the way the entire movie. not bad quality but you cant remove the subtitles.
,xblaze45,2012-08-17T10:59Z,this also has hardcoded KOR subs and looks like kor edition even with the english voice. SUPER lame!
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-17T12:23Z,"What in the TURD is this??? Hollywood should just take a laxative so it can Turd it all out in one shot and purge themselves of this miserable trend of SHITTY flicks. It's so cheesy and stupid, who cares about HardCoded Subs? This rip doesn't deserve any more bandwidth at all."
,Aberyst,2012-08-17T17:05Z,@ChillyCrossFoot you obviously are a moron and had no idea what they were trying/did with this film. They meant to put a bunch of horror flick cliches in it and guess what...they actually did it right in this film. I saw this in theaters several times with my wife. This movie is going to be a classic because it was that awesome.
,ifurlove,2012-08-17T17:49Z,"Bad subtitle and you can not remove it.
Korean subs."
,Seefer,2012-08-17T23:53Z,""" this is a democracy. You can complain "" you're fuckin retarded. Go complain to the FBI and see what happens, numb nuts. 

"" Derrr... my pirated torrent has korean subtitles... derrr "" "
,mandruf,2012-08-18T00:00Z,"What kind of retard would HC subtitles in 2012 ?
The movie is totally ruined if you're not Korean.

I can't believe no one made a release of this.
You can only find the Korean version."
,BannBerjani,2012-08-18T01:15Z,One of the shittest movies ive seen in my life!!!
,mrflippels,2012-08-18T02:01Z,HARD CODED CHINESE SUBS CRAPPY
,jperez2003us,2012-08-18T02:22Z,It has hardcoded kor subs 多why you didnt say that?
,1eyedfishstick,2012-08-18T03:00Z,"Hardcoded subs? WTF? Why would someone hardcode subs? The world is full of morans.

Haha, I mean morons, of course (I ain't one)."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-18T17:25Z,"@Aberyst: You know what, you keep that wife of yours away from the likes of me. Women like smart guys. You won't stand a chance. I threaten the survival of 1 brain celled organism such as your self. What're you doing watching a skanky teenage film with bad acting? Wait a minute, you're American aren't you? Keep your wife. I feel so sorry for you. You oughta start wasting your time by masturbating to your home made white trash pr0n and see who finishes first, you or you in your homemade trailer trash pr0n. Hey, while youre at it breaking records, why dont you write the olympic committee and have that event included into one of them many things you dumb asses are good at...You little punk b.itch! "
,MARYUS1010,2012-08-18T19:17Z,"Dude, next time when you post a movie dont forget to mention in the title ""koreanhardsub""! Is annoying to see two subs when i watch!"

,oldbreadbutt,2012-08-19T06:22Z,"the video quality is fine as is the audio. there are however hard coded Korean subs, which would be fine if they were mentioned in the torrent title or description. I speak English, and can't read Korean, so downloading this was a waste of my time.

voting down because the Korean subs aren't mentioned anywhere in the torrent description."

,schizom,2012-08-20T14:16Z,"guys, stop rating the movie. dont give us this crap, nobody cares about your (poor) taste. tell us about the quality of the the rip itself, WE DONT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

go to imdb to shit out your movie-opinions you fuckheads."
,Dreadmore,2012-08-20T18:38Z,"Great upload, I prefer the subs to the crop.. You idiots complaining about em go download the cropped one.. God I wish I could make sure a torrent was good without sifting through a sea of morons complaining. I wish they would add some kind of filter for the comments"

,erraticchevy,2012-08-20T22:50Z," Please, I don't mean to be ungrateful, again I just think it would be better for the Users here and easier for me so that I could enjoy a movie I download. "

,jizzcock,2012-09-09T20:03Z,People need to stop seeding this shit. Has hardcoded Korean subtitles that ruin the film but doesn't mention that in Torrent name or description. Bullshit.
