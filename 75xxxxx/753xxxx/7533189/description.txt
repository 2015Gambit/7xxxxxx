The New Warriors was originally compiled by writer/editor Tom DeFalco, consisting of the young superheroes Nova, Speedball, Namorita, Marvel Boy, and Firestar, all of whom were once featured in solo series or were supporting characters in more established series. To this mix Defalco added Night Thrasher, an original character to serve as the team's founder and leader. This made them a counterpart to DC ComicsΓÇÖ Teen Titans or a junior version of MarvelΓÇÖs own Avengers, although the New Warriors were not sidekicks of the Avengers as many of the original Teen Titans were to members of the Justice League. The New Warriors were featured in an eponymous series from 1990 until 1996, which both benefited and suffered from being marketed to the MTV Generation.
