No accumulated cost if you need more than one type media supported. IsoBuster is a highly specialized yet easy to use optical media data recovery tool. It supports all optical disc formats and all common optical disc file-systems. Start up IsoBuster, Insert a disc, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present.

* All Windows / DOS / Macintosh / HFS Partitions are immediately shown
* All the file-system(s) in those partitions are immediatly shown
* You can use all the features you normally would use on tracks and sessions, but now on partitions.
* You can do data recovery pretty much the exact same way as on optical
* Forensics investigators will love the easy overview of all partitions and all file systems
* See sector per sector content with Sector View
* Extract portions of the media
* Support for UDF, FAT, NTFS, HFS(+) on any partition
* Etc.
