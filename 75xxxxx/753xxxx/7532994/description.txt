Clifton Webb stars in this fascinating true story of a daring intelligence operation prior to the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily.  Lt. Commander Montagu (Webb) plants letters regarding the British intention to land in Greece on a dead soldier outfitted to look like an English officer, knowing that the papers will ultimately fall into German hands.  What follows is a taut cat and mouse game as British Intelligence races to stay one step ahead of the Nazi agent dispatched to verify the dead man's identity.  Directed by Ronald Neame, and costarring Gloria Grahame and Stephen Boyd.
