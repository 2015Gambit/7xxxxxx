,yinyang1968,2012-08-16T07:55Z,Hi @jmanwf - I'm actually not getting any video to this file. Just audio. Have tried a few players and still no video.  Is it just me? Anyone else having this problem? Thanks
[T],jmanwf,2012-08-16T08:37Z,you will need VLC MEDIA PLAYER to play it from now on i will be uploading in the better quality but low Mega Bytes MP4 file format: mp4 is highly used but windows media player is pretty crap. it also depends on how old your computer is and what codecs you have installed in your computer mp4 is higher quality than avi i have tested this file and it works fine apart from the first 13 seconds which are pixellated
,Dimmis80,2012-08-16T12:28Z,"Hey friend.About 14/8 episode i had for the first time with your uploads  problems with the episode and i actualy did not manage to watch it.I will explain.I use your vids with a Digital Media player an ""AC Ryan"" so all of the vids i put them in an external hard drive witch i conect them to my Digital player and i watch them in my TV.My player plays hundrets of formats of video and sound and all of the known.And its compatible with as long as 1080pBlue Ray like my tv.A very small persentage of vids like movies,soap and stuff but a very small don't play in the way that i hear the music or sound but the vid not play but again its very u know not happen very often.So DOOL 14/8 did not just hear sound and not play vid but for the first time with my player it says something like wrong file and stuff.!!All my other stuff plays fine and my external HD is just fine so its not my Hardware.I play the vid in my pc in my bs player and it did not play there to and always your vids play there.Just sound and no image.So i use VLC and it plays there ok in my pc.So my questions.!Did u change something in your vids so now my Dplayer will not from now on play the episodes and i will not be cool to watch it in my tv like always.?And if u did that can u just use the old type that i was cool again with my Dplayer.??To be honest i love to watch in my tv and not in pc and i thing that a lot of people and not only me might have problems with their Dplayers.!???Dont mention that my pc monitor its great for video games and stuff but not so good for watch vids like soap or movies so i very rarely watch that kind of vids there.!So i hope that i will be cool again and i will watch the episodes in my tv mate.!????"
,yinyang1968,2012-08-16T18:08Z,"Thanks  jmanwf, it is playing just fine in VLC player.  I have a pretty good system set up to my TV and pretty much all of the players & codecs you could imagine.  I think I tried to play it in just about every one last night except VLC for some dumb reason.  Thanks for the Upload :-) It's all Good."
