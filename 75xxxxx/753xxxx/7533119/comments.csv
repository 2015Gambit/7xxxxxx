Forbrydelsen.(The Killing).S01E01.Day 2.mkv 2.07 GiB 
Forbrydelsen.(The Killing).S01E02.Day 2.mkv 2.07 GiB 
Forbrydelsen.(The Killing).S01E01.Day 1.mkv 2.04 GiB 

S01E01 is added 2 times, the first time the episode title is Day 1 and second time episode title is Day 2, and file size differs? To complete the confusion is there another file with episode title Day 2, but this is S01E02.

Uploader please explain!"
,P_W_W,2012-08-17T03:18Z,"S01E01.Day 2 and S01E02.Day 2 have exactly the same file size. Probably this file is S01E02.Day 2 and can S01E01.Day 2 be deleted.
I will confirm or revoke this after downloading, but respons of uploader would be welcome too."
,P_W_W,2012-08-17T03:32Z,"Btw ;-)
Thx 4 this upload Anonymous!"
,P_W_W,2012-08-17T08:38Z,"Torrent is SO SLOW, seeder has very limited upload capacity. Downloading on my end of this 46.26 GiB is gonna take 10-12 days!
Anonymous seeder: find some help to seed!"
,Freak_NL,2012-08-17T15:36Z,"Hi,

Damn, made a mistake!! P_W_W, you are right. Both files are identical, and both contain episode 2. Pfff, how did this happen.. :( Sorry for the inconvience. 

As for upload speed, there's really nothing much I can do about that. I just hope people will help me seed once they reach 100% "
,P_W_W,2012-08-17T22:48Z,"I am now on 18% and will keep it open a few weeks 24/7 after finishing, will make it at least 1.5:1.
I have not that much upload myself, but sure will seed."
,Freak_NL,2012-08-18T12:42Z,"Thank you. And some incentive for the rest;

When I have 10 seeders for a couple of weeks I will post season 2 in the same quality."
,P_W_W,2012-08-18T20:01Z,"I'm about 30% now, but gone for two days. Right at this moment there were NO seeders and other leechers were maximum at Âą 50%.
I hope you will return to go on seeding, Freak_NL !!
I was using already half my upload for this torrent and will go on to do that when I return monday.
Cheers, P_W_W"
,P_W_W,2012-08-20T16:22Z,"9 seeders, torrent runs fine!"
,P_W_W,2012-08-22T12:13Z,"Most downloaders hit and run. Peers that stay to seed after they finished downloading, use very limited bandwith, resulting in average downloadspeed under 100 KiB/s.
That's the downside of an open tracker."
,Freak_NL,2012-09-12T14:38Z,"Season 2 is here!
