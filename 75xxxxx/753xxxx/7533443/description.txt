The Book of Beast

Part fitness guide, part nutrition and supplement guide, part insider guide to the world of bodybuilding, this booklet explains each of the Body Beast Phases in depth, walks you through the nutrition plan, provides you with easy-to-follow recipes, and gives you sound advice on how to not only maintain the physique you'll develop but also how to prepare for a bodybuilding competition and photo shoot.
