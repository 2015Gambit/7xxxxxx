Looks like we have a few typos in the Book of Beast, largely centering around the carbs and proteins in our Fuel Shot and Base Shake supplements.

While these mistakes may seem substantial, they’re not. The Body Beast Nutrition Plan features thousands of calories. When building mass, a smart, high caloric plan like this basically guarantees you are getting all the protein, carbs, and fat you need, so slight shifts in those macronutrients shouldn’t have an impact. Basically, we’re talking changes along the lines of an egg white worth of protein or a couple grapes of carbs at the most. You’ll get big and stay healthy regardless of shifts that minor.

That said, we want to give you the best possible product for your investment. Furthermore, we know that many of you like to take a hands-on approach to the math aspect of your diet, so we want you to have the most accurate numbers to do that.

Page 71 –

For the recovery recipes, make that ONE scoop of Fuel Shot to one scoop of Base Shake (instead of 2:1).

You may notice that this creates a ratio slightly below the 3:1 protein:carbs we mention earlier on the page. This is okay for two reasons. First, ease-of use. This balanced combination is easy to mix and, if you’re using these two supplements solely as a recovery aid, this recipe will make both tubs a one-month supply.

Second, both Fuel Shot and Base Shake are unflavored. While drinking them alone is effective nutrition, it’s not as delicious as, say, Beachbody Results & Recovery Formula, so we’re assuming you’ll want to flavor your Body Beast postworkout drink with something from the liquid carbs list. By keeping the initial ratio low, we’ve given you much more flexibility with your flavoring options.
