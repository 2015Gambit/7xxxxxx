Source: SBD > Cass/0 > DAT
Transfer: vDAT > Wavelab 6 (mastering) > FLAC16
Transfer and mastering by Art H.
Seeded at etree (105744).
For this release I fixed the pitch with Goldwave such that it would match with a fully digital source (see .txt for details) and also created tagged MP3's for those who do not need Flac."
