[V],psspss,2012-08-15T12:21Z,"bigfoot and ghosts in this episode

some interesting ghost stuff caught on camera and evp"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-15T12:25Z,"its prob just mid season break.they always do that.you never know thou,Ghost Lab was a great show with good ratings & it got droped after only 2 seasons"
[V],psspss,2012-08-15T12:28Z,"just to note also

at about 21:30sec in theres some video corruptions

howeverr i check the source mp4 and that had the 3 second long damage as well..
happens when they are doign review

but not at a crucial part"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-15T14:41Z,thats not to say this will get droped but they may air a short season for whatever reason
[V],psspss,2012-08-15T14:45Z,:O
[T],trialNerror,2012-08-15T19:15Z,"nuggzz is right - this is just a mid season finale. the last 7 eps will probably pop up around the start of 2013

and yes i know there was a blurp at 21:30 but as pss stated you're not missing anything so i released it anyway

hey pss you ever figure out MeGUI? "
[V],psspss,2012-08-16T02:39Z,"yes I did and it fail for some converts and interface looks like it was designed by a unix user
it does make some things easier like autogk


but in the end using a mix of tools works out best

anyhow I prob be cutting back as afg is doing them all now and data is a bit much

I prob go back to what I started out doing finding the missing UFO and ghost shows

but with all the shit going down it ruins the sharing vibe even if its a low grade xvid quality

the fookers still want to ruin it for overseas viewers.. they tried it with 3 strike which was a failed attempt"
