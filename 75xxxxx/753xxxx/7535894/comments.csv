[V],Anacondaz,2012-08-16T13:23Z,thanks for the upload mate
,reelook,2012-08-16T16:40Z,it worked on windows 7 64-Bit....With NIS 2012..90 Days...only
,.HuNtEr.,2012-08-17T02:19Z,Re-do when 90 days ends
,capth4u,2012-08-20T14:20Z,"All this thing did was cause my Norton to disappear and not load up again! I tried the option 6b in safe mode and nothing.

Instructions are simple so it wasn't anything I did....wtf"
,capth4u,2012-08-20T20:04Z,I will uninstall completely and re-install- Also will use the norton removal tool 
,capth4u,2012-08-21T00:13Z,"Ok ..well.. it jacked up my computer to where my browsers would not connect to the internet. I had to format and re-install windows! I do not want to format again ... any ideas to help?

When I ran the patch it would flash error somethings super fast then just a flashing cursor. I waited for 5 mins for it to say complete or something but nothing. Any ideas or is this just a crappy patch?"
,Teffi91,2012-09-04T09:44Z,"It works for me,thanks :D"
,pg065,2012-09-05T22:05Z,"It works perfectly if you just follow the instructions, except that you have to re-do the procedure after 180 days.  

Thanks to .HuNtEr. for doing is this great favor. =)"
