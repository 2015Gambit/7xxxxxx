I upped E01-E02 weeks ago but wrongly called it INSAME so if you have those
they will be the same as the first 2 in this bundle
so add them to it and do a recheck in utorrent to help seed those first
so you get the others sooner



inversions -- but which ride is the best? Insane Coaster Wars invites thrill-seekers to settle the battle once and for all.

From May 7 to June 1, 2012, you -- our Travel Channel viewer -- voted on which coaster is the best in various categories, from G-Force Giants to Hang ΓÇÖem High coasters. On Sunday, July 8, 2012, Insane Coaster Wars premieres with Episode 1: G-Force Giants, followed by Episode 2: Hang 'em High. The winner in each category -- based on your votes -- will be revealed at the end of the show.
