Introduction

The best way to get started using Wirecast is to quickly work through all its main features. This tour presents a series of three tutorials, each designed to help you understand how to create and broadcast presentations using Wirecast.

As you work through these tutorials, you will also become familiar with important Wirecast concepts and how you can use them to deliver high quality broadcasts. The more you know about Wirecast, the better it will serve your broadcasting objectives.

Because each tutorial builds on the skills and knowledge you learn in the previous tutorials, it is recommended that you take the tours in succession. Working through all the tutorials takes about thirty minutes.

As you gain hands-on experience creating video and audio presentations - which leads to a working knowledge of Wirecast and its components and architecture - you will gain proficiency in using Wirecast.
