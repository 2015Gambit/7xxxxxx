Maybe it will need only 10-15mb just for your mobile to play.Do it with internet connection and let it download the data and let me know what happen."
,Yawako,2012-08-21T21:01Z,"I cant get pass ""begin download"" nothing happen with or without the SD Data. Its like it hangup. I have to use the home key then manually end task it.

[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-23T03:42Z,@You both extract the zip file with the sd data?you must first do that and then copy the folder in it in the sd card where i said.Then run the game.If it still ask for data open wifi and download them.The game will run fine. 
,abhisaini99,2012-08-25T09:32Z,"Sorry to point out again but even after unzipping the data and placing it into sdcard/android/data folder, the game still asks for 250 MB data to be downloaded. And when it starts to download it gets stuck ever before downloading first file. Then it just sits there....sd data u have provided is around 296 MB and after unzipping the size is 537 MB. Doesn't it seem wrong to any of you that it still asks for 250 MB data to be downloaded. It seems that game is not looking for files in data folder(just a guess)"
