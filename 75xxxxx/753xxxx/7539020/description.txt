This is something of a test - please leave feedback ...

If you do not have an AAC codec or if you're using VLC ...
put this mp3 into the same folder as the AVI.
There are three ways to use this MP3 audio with the original AVI.

1) Use Media Player Classic. right click on video, select audio and sub select the second track on the list.

2) Use Virtualdub (set A & V to 'direct stream copy') to physically replace the audio track. Help can be found if you don't see how.

3) VLC - boy, how to take something simple and make it REALLY hard!

Click Media-Advanced Open File.
Select video to play.
Check "show more options"
Select audio to play.
Click "play" (file will start playing silently)
Click Audio-Audio Track-Track 2

you should be hearing the external mp3 in sync with the AVI

Tada!

Leave some feedback, please ...
