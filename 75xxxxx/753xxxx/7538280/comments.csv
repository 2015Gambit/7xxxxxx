This remains the only torrent where certain of these most wonderful classics are collected. I truly wish my single voice could stand for hundreds. Thank you."

I live in a country where English is a foreign language and it's quite difficult to get any books in English here, so your book packs will be so useful for me and for my daughter! The quality of scanning is perfect and the file sizes are quite moderate at the same time.
Please, if possible, keep on doing this great job of yours, you are helping so many parents to entertain their children!
I will seed all your book packs as long as I can)"
