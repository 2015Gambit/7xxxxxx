Scott's guests include:

Deborah Robinet discusses the P.A.U.L. Festival (People Awakening and Uniting for Liberty) to pay tribute to Ron Paul in Tampa, Florida on August 24-26; the guest speakers and bands scheduled to play; and the official Paul presidential campaignΓÇÖs strange tactics.

Dina Rasor, founder of the Project on Government Oversight, discusses why Congress keeps providing funds for M-1 tanks the Army doesnΓÇÖt want; how cheap IEDs made heavily armored vehicles a liability in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the M-1?s flawed design and anachronistic purpose -- fighting WWIII against Soviet tanks in Europe.

Iran expert Flynt Leverett will be on to talk about U.S. foreign policy in Syria as driven by U.S. focus on Iran.
