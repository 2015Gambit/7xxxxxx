,nazgull2k10,2012-08-18T07:06Z,HOW did this lame ass god awful fuckin show get a 2nd season?  
,Fritz.,2012-08-18T18:10Z,"well since the network stations are out to make money all they really care about is ratings and number of viewers.

therefore a person could logically conclude that this show had good ratings and a large number of viewers.

dont strain your brain though."
,eyonoria,2012-08-19T03:45Z,Awesome upload for an awesome tv series ! Thanks man!.
,wenex,2012-08-19T16:59Z,@fritz - lol. I love how people come to a torrent just to comment on how shitty the tv show is. Incidental criticism it ain't.
