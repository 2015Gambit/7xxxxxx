Canada's wilderness expert Les Stroud lived with ten tribes performing their daily tasks, reporting their rites & rituals, explaining their beliefs, and documenting their age-old sustainable existence - before Civilization assimilates or annihilates them.

Someone nicely uploaded seven episodes in AVI format; thought I'd make these as MP4s for smaller file sizes and iPod-portability.

This show is viewable streaming on Netflix, but not available on disc, and it's $50 on Les's website (where I got it) but even pricier on Amazon.

I hope you enjoy this program; these people don't deserve to fall victim to Civilized culture's insanity.
