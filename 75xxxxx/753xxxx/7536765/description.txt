Catching up ...

You must know by now this is for real.
I only want to provide what has so recently been taken away.
I am not looking for credit - you won't know who I am.
No moniker of my own - just credit to the original capper.
It's their work, it bears only their stamp.
It would be better if they released this AVI themselves.
But here we are.

Like the capper, hate the container?
EVOLVE, 2HD, LOL, FQM, KILLERS,
BAJSKORV, HULKSMASH, MOMENTUM ...
All now available in familiar AVI format
Grab their NFO - it's the same information
This is NOT a recode or transcode
It is their actual file, only the container has changed.

There is a discussion to be had for which makes a better AVI.
Re-encoded 720p to XVID {AFG, MP4SXX} or
Unmodified X264 container change.
The latter is a whole lot easier to create.
LossLess conversion is really quick.
There should be room for all contributors.

Sorry to be anonymous, they are in Canada - I am not
Sorry I can't reply to comments and stay anonymous
I do read them, even the impolite ones.
