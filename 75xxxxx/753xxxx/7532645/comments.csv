For those who don't know what this is - it's copyright protection that begins muting the audio about 17 minutes into the movie. I believe it is by Sony and all DVD players that play Blue Ray must agree to install it on their players. Older DVD players are not effected as long as you don't upgrade the firmware. 

Media players are not effected by it, and neither is VLC. "
