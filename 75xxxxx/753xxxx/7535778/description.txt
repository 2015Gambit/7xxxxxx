A kaleidoscope of surreal, emotionally provocative, and powerfully resonant imagery; in GLASS LIPS, contemporary artist, Lech Majewski, explores a hidden human frontier where memory, madness, and imagination meet. 

The film began its life as an installation of interrelated video art features, entitled BLOOD OF A POET that opened the Majewski retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York on May 3, 2006. Rejecting dialogue and chronology it marked an innovative approach to the traditional narration: simultaneous flow of images, events, and visual associations created a cross-section of a human consciousness. 

Based on this cycle, Lech Majewski assembled a full lengths feature, GLASS LIPS, telling the story of a young poet at odds with himself and with the world. After the death of his mother - although the possibility of "after" is always, in GLASS LIPS, relative - the young poet finds himself shut away in a psychiatric ward. From his isolation he sees his mother, his violent father and his father's lovers. Through this process of remembering, the visions overlap and communicate with one another, continually asking the viewer to develop a new method of interpretation.
