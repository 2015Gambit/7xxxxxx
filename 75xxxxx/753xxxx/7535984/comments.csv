,cbrcoder,2012-08-16T10:42Z,"It will be great if you mention the SHA1 Hash as well. You can easily get the SHA1 hash by using utilities like hashmyfile. For this iso to be unadulterated, it must be SHA1 Hash of 6A2B87BCD336A96AC39CF85348E93E5AF45588EB
 as per MSDN"
,UA-07,2012-08-16T10:51Z,"@cbrcoder , these are the original files from MZT . I just repacked the files in a .iso image . "
,booklet,2012-08-16T13:04Z,Any idea regarding the latest release of VS2010 en_visual_studio_ultimate_2012_x86_dvd_920947.iso?
,mlsz,2012-08-16T13:07Z,"this isnt the official file from MDSN. the real file name should be: 

en_visual_studio_ultimate_2012_x86_dvd_920947.iso "
,mlsz,2012-08-16T13:11Z,"don't you mean WZT btw, not MZT.
wzt's leaked version is unfortunetly not equal to the offical mdsn version."
,millennium5,2012-08-16T14:56Z,"You should download the trail version from Microsoft here instead: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads#ultimate

its a 90 day trail, fully functioning, by that time the real iso should be here at PB for download.

Also if your planning to use this incomplete version you should install the trail version first so you have all the files when setup is finished, that should remove the trial and transform it into a full version."
,millennium5,2012-08-16T15:03Z,"Another thing is that very few developers really need the 2000 dollar Ultimate edition, if your new to programming or a novice developer user the Visual Studio Express versions instead, they are FREE!

Cause if your not an expert developer the Ultimate edition has far to many features for you, it will just make your head spin and keep you from learning what you need to learn -> system development. ;)

Download FREE express versions here: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/products/express"

,xpmule,2012-08-16T16:28Z,"cbrcoder i like ""HashSlash""
load it up and drag n drop a file on it..
its free clean and safe etc too

also for those that do not know ?
 these are the scene releases i have seen so far confirmed and spread everywhere..

Microsoft.Visual.Studio.Professional.2012-KOPiE (1.4gb)

Microsoft.Visual.Studio.Ultimate.2012-REMEDY (1.4gb)

i do NOT have hashs for either release though because i didn't download any VS2012 i am sticking with the previous version.. i don't intend to use anything that involves windows 8 and VS2010 is setup for me good.."
,millennium5,2012-08-16T21:31Z,"@xpmule: VS 2010 is great, I agree with you on this new windows 8 crap, it looks like a new windows 95 flop to me. However there are some revolutionarry aspects with it like also win 95 was. Without win 95 it is not sure at all we would sit her on the internett today as win 95 made the internett availeble for everyone.

Win 8 now is the merger between mobile and stationary computing which too is a revolution, I just hope that smartphone vendors will get the hint and create more powerful 64 bit smartphones with wireless 1080p ans well as mouse and keyboard and full windows application support soon so we finally can have our PC in our pockets.

Back to VS 2012 it also has the new page inspector for ppl like me who mainly develop web applications, its kick ass. So if your a webdeveloper and system architect like me you wanna switch to 2012."
,UA-07,2012-08-17T01:15Z,"@mlsz , yes its MZT .
@millennium5, you should fuck yourself and stop spamming my torrents . I will definitely report you in the forums .

For everyone else this release doesn't have a major difference between the MSDN release . Your welcome to download it , and its good to go so please stop asking about hashes . I am uploading at 150 KBps and there are other seeders so it won't take time to download and test it yourself ."
,UA-07,2012-08-17T01:16Z,"*correction*

@mlsz , yes its WZT ."
,xpmule,2012-08-17T01:54Z,"millennium5
not sure what the uploader is getting so uptight about.. i didn't see anyone say anything bad about him or this torrent..
And you made good points about Win8 and VS12 i however do no web based dev work ;)

And asking for the has is pointless but a valid question !
Why ? so we can compare the has to the other releases such as the ones i mentioned etc.. fair right ?
And th eother reason its pointless to ask is the torrent contains 1 file and the torrent hash IS the hash ;)
So if you want it ? its at the top right of the page ;)"
,cbrcoder,2012-08-17T07:36Z,"Sorry but if you intend to keep updating SP1 and above it's better to stay away from ""leaks"".

Instead use the official version. I found a great official torrent here : http://nnm-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=535927"
,millennium5,2012-08-17T10:40Z,@UA-07: I have  no idea what your wanna report but whatever it is - feel free to do so.
,millennium5,2012-08-17T10:54Z,"@xpmule: Well, I agree with you, no need to upgrade if there is nothing there that will improve your productivity. For me there most certainly is, the new page inspector and also the new and improved architectural tools are really great. 

Also if your developing in legacy code vs 2012 will help you a lot with the new code clone tool that helps you identify clones and the architectural tools that that together with TFS 2012 help you to ensure that your team only checks in code that does comply your architecture."
,UA-07,2012-08-18T01:43Z,"@millennium5 , sorry for getting mad at you . your comments are welcome . :)"
,millennium5,2012-08-18T12:25Z,"@UA-07: Its ok, we can all misunderstand stuff. Thanks for the UP! Shalom!"
,fake2,2012-08-19T14:23Z,"for those getting an error kind of 'missing a windows sdk file..."", it's actually located at packagesWindows SDK, but the name has some words in different position, just browse and pick the right name"
,fake2,2012-08-19T14:27Z,... and thank you for this upload!!!
