,DinDinny,2012-08-16T15:33Z,"I am also wondering if it can be used without a JTAG...
What does this mean: ""A Select B Back X Sign Out Y Xbox Dashboard""
I think That was poorly written, but seems like directions on how to get it to work."

No you not, when I purchased my xbox 360 (  LT3.0 ) I tried, wasted few days. I found so many ways to explore HDD, transfer data n bla bla bla but whenever I try see game inside console it shows corrupt it never worked. Asked many people and experts didn't so far :(
I loved 2 games and lost hope at the moment for them. May the the LT guys do some mod to make it work but who knows.. I don't think so there will be any update will come."

Buddy do you have any idea how to make it work on LT3.0?? ? really want to get some xbla games man."
,GSergeant,2012-08-17T16:55Z,"Allright. Everyone wants to play games and there is always a way, jtag or not. But consider, this way will come up only as soon as they find that it is profitable."
[V],boobsman,2012-08-18T10:50Z,"@ DinDinny those are the controls from jtag / rgh content, this does not work on flashed consoles and you cannot burn to disc, as the description says you need jtag or rgh modded console for this to work."
,GSergeant,2012-08-19T13:03Z,Thank you my friend.
