,Carjacker,2012-08-17T07:33Z,"""Time Crash"" was filmed for the 2007 Children in Need charity appeal.
""Time Crash"" 
The episode, set during the last scene of the previous episode ""Last of the Time Lords"", depicts a humorous encounter between the Doctor's fifth and tenth incarnations, played by Peter Davison and David Tennant respectively.
So, watch that FIRST!! Enjoy!"

At what CRF did you encode all your Doctor Who uploads? 
And why is the bitrate of the audio of the first season only 192Kbps, while that of the other seasons is 448Kbps?"
,Carjacker,2012-08-17T21:45Z,"The audio of the first season -and every season- is not 192kb. I use one file to make a baseline for posting (I believe that 192kb you see is what the Confidential video was at,while the actual episodes are all at 448kb) since I cant and dont have enough space in the description to post every files actual bitrates but they are all within the same parameters of the post."
,Carjacker,2012-08-17T21:51Z,I use the default of 20 for CFR for a good line between quality and compression size.
