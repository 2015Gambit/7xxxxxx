WE LOST. THEY WON. In the wake of an apocalyptic alien invasion, the worlds greatest super hero and deadliest super villain must form an alliance to prevent their own extermination. Nox and Red Reaper continue their trek across the ravaged American countryside, amassing former friends and foes for the ultimate battle of resistance. But when old grievances rear their ugly heads, will the alliance survive the journey intact, or will it be torn apart from the inside out?
