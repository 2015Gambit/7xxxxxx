Rumer

Fueled by the much-admired hit singles, ΓÇ£SlowΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Aretha,ΓÇ¥ RumerΓÇÖs debut Seasons of My Soul was certified platinum upon its U.K. release in 2010, reaching Top 5 in Belgium, Norway, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands, eliciting critical acclaim along the way. The U.S. release of the album was followed by a number of high-profile TV appearances, including NBCΓÇÖs The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, E! News, and CBS Sunday Morning. The latter feature instantly established Rumer as a major star, catapulting the album to #1 on the iTunes Store as well as both Amazon and Barnes & NobleΓÇÖs digital albums charts. She recently appeared on the all-star PBS music special Burt Bacharach & Hal Davis: The Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in Performance at the White House, performing for President and Mrs. Obama with Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crow, Michael Feinstein, Diana Krall, Lyle Lovett and Arturo Sandoval, among others. Her cover of ΓÇ£A House is Not a HomeΓÇ¥ can be seen here.

Daryl was suitably impressed with the U.K. singer/songwriter. "Since having her on the show, I have spent some time with Rumer, and we have quickly become friends. She is an interesting and impressive combination of spirituality and down-to-earth 'centeredness' that gives her a unique perspective on what we all do as musicians and communicators. I think her seemingly 'smooth' style frames a very passionate view toward life. More power to her."
