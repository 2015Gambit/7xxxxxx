MPEG Streamclip Tutorial

Introduction
MPEG Streamclip (or just Streamclip) is a program designed for Mac or Windows that allows the user to quickly clip various types of video formats, cut, and convert the file into any other type of video format. This program is a useful tool for quick cuts and macro film cutting as well as URL video downloading and audio extraction. All this is combined into an easy-to-use alternative to iMovie, Final Cut, or QuickTime, which are very expensive.
