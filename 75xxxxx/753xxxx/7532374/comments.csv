,davemoosehead,2012-08-29T03:01Z,Didn't work for me. Said serial was invalid after I reconnected to the internet. It reverted me back into trial mode. Pretty sure I did everything right. Might have been because I had an old version that I had to uninstall. My firewall never picked up on Adobe phoning home either.

,Blu_T,2012-09-07T01:19Z,Keygen.exe positive for trojan
,jersson,2012-09-13T16:00Z,The problem is that everytime you go on line the serial gets blacklisted so I have to enter a new one. Only way is a patch or a crack to get around this. I went back to vers 10.0 which has a patch and it works with no problem
