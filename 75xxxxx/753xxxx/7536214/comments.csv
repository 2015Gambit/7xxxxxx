,x.morbid.x,2012-08-16T08:07Z,Would a DLer be so kind as to share your assessment of quality?  Thank you.
,ziggi1000,2012-08-16T09:02Z,"Movie cut from the bottom

A=9
V=7"
,dynamo8899,2012-08-16T09:17Z,"Finally after all the fake BS someone put this out, thanks alot for this upload you rock. Now all I need is The Bourne legacy to show up, anybody got it?"
,goofy113,2012-08-16T10:18Z,"ty for the upload, mind putting up some screens for it? very eazy way for us picky dl.ers to see the quality :)"
,avince9450,2012-08-16T10:28Z,"Searched all over for this movie, and it was a let down. The movie screen is cut in half so all you see are the heads of people. I wouldn't advise downloading. "
,rcr29budcar,2012-08-16T10:37Z,"I'd give video 6-7  and audio 9  I would have given the video a higher rating if not for the bottom being cropped.  It can be kind of annoying at times, but a very good upload.  Great job to all who had anything to do with getting this one out to us! Thanks very much."
,rcr29budcar,2012-08-16T10:46Z,"Oh yeah,  if anyone can get a decent copy of The Campaign, i'd be one happy sum bitch!  I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell's movies, and a movie with him and Zack Galifianikis both has got to hilarious. "
,whateveryousay,2012-08-16T16:26Z,What's with that buzzing in the audio track?
,whateveryousay,2012-08-16T16:31Z,"I ask again, wondering why my original query was deleted:  what is with the buzzing in the audio track?"
,whateveryousay,2012-08-16T16:32Z,"Ah, never mind.  My original comment reappeared. My bad."
,zero423,2012-08-16T17:03Z,this torrent is fuckin garbage....i dont know why people upload shit that is always missing HALF THE FUCKING SCREEN.... dont waste your time.
,whateveryousay,2012-08-16T17:39Z,"Yeah.  Maybe later someone will post the lower half of the movie, and then we'll be all set.  Thanks for the hype, early commentators. Here's a tip:  before you comment on a movie, try watching the f*cking thing first."
,rezonate,2012-08-16T18:59Z,"for the people saying about finding fakes and that.

use a scene release site there are many out there but here are the main 2 that I use.
once it's on these you know there are copys out there but you still have to decide if the quality is good enough for you ;-)"
,rezonate,2012-08-16T19:00Z,"this one has screen shots for most releases
http://sceper.eu/category/movies"
,f20cs13,2012-08-17T03:38Z,"a/10
v/6 (it out of shot most of the time)
m/2

This was a horrible fucking movie. I was  disappointed considering the cast"
,Pmoney559,2012-08-17T05:46Z,"Very watchable even though bottom of the screen is cut off a few times but its only from their mouth down most of the time.
A/7
V/7"
,rechisoke,2012-08-17T16:42Z,"The Watch is one of those comedies that seems to rely too heavily on its cast's abilities and believes it can phone-in other key parts of filmmaking such as writing, tone, direction, and wit. When we laugh during the film, are we laughing because the scenarios are funny or because these are actors we've all seen in funny movies? Combing three of the funniest and most reliable actors working today, and one British actor who already has a loyal fanbase in America, seems like an easy recipe for success, but the recipe begins to call for too much and offer too little quickly. I had to watch it on freehd.vizonshow.com because of better quality. I recommend the movie, it's a fun, relaxation movie with a lot of funny scenes."
,missworld,2012-08-17T19:07Z,"How can the video be given a 6 or 7 out of 10?? When it's cut in half? Are you still using VHS tapes or what? 

Don't bother commenting if you can't rate the movie correctly. "
,dreisday,2012-08-18T00:05Z,"Please stop ranting about the quality and hating on the uploader, if you want quality pay the money to watch it in the cinema. Remember this is free so just shut up and take what you are given."
,KIDPETE42,2012-08-18T04:17Z,WILL SOME1 ANSWER THE MOTHER FUCKING VIBRATING PHONE DAMNNN ... MORE ANNOYING THEN HALF THE MOVIE BEING CROPPED OUT .. ITHER THAT OR THERE WAS A CHICK IN THE MOVIES WIT A LITTLE RABBIT WIT LOW BATTERY LOLLLL
,KIDPETE42,2012-08-18T04:18Z,OTHER THEN THAT ITS ALL GOODZZ WHAT U EXPECT TO SHIT IS FRA FRA FREEEEE
,KIDPETE42,2012-08-18T04:19Z,WOWWWWWW
,Nanoq1,2012-08-18T17:38Z,Half screen... 
,ransik,2012-08-19T04:38Z,"I watched it.  Its cropped way to much off the bottom, cuts off about 1/3 of what is needed.  Audio had a rythmic cycle of noise.  For a TS:
a=4
v=4
m=8

Will watch it again when a better copy comes out."
,-Slurpy-,2012-08-19T15:11Z,"Not bad for a cam, would love to see the bottom part though"
,daturts,2012-08-19T19:59Z,Who the fuck is Richard Ayoade
,rapster123,2012-08-19T22:07Z,"V7 A6 
"
,bfooks,2012-08-24T22:52Z,"Thanks. :)

Stay tuned for the bottom half of the movie lol."
,martink61,2012-08-25T10:42Z,"Not Worth downloading.
Since only the top half of the screen is visible.
Why would someone set up their camcorder to record only the top half of a film?.. add to that, a low toned beep that goes off every 3 seconds all the way through, and there you have it. FAIL"
,martink61,2012-08-25T10:53Z,"Someone asked - who the F... is Richard Ayoade..
The answer is, the funniest person on the extremely well written brittish comedy called ""The I.T Crowd"" He plays a Computer nerd, who is part of a companies I.T Support staff. If you get the chance to watch an episode do, cos it makes all that crap like ""The Office"" look even crapper. I cant believe anyone actually found the office genuinely funny. If wit were shit, Ricky G would be constipated!"
,niccisushi,2012-08-28T07:58Z,"@daturts: Who the fuck is Richard Ayoade?

WTF are you doing on a site like this if you don't know who he is? I had to actually go register just because I so mad, SO MAD at your comment.

Anyways, you're a fucknugget. Go suck a duck vagina."
,duncan26,2012-08-28T19:58Z,"@niccisushi
nobody fucking watches that shit!i live in the uk and dont know who he is!i also watch nearly all of the 3 main characters movies(as they are all famous as fuck) and dont know richard ayoba or whatever!and i bet not many ppl know that 2!so shut the fuck up!"
,plibdiggle,2012-08-29T14:36Z,"@duncan26 Duncan is a shit name. sort of makes me think of someone like Karl Pilkington, but only dumber, uglier and nowhere near as fun to watch. Basically, something that this earth would be better off without.

My point is that I hate you for causing me to waste my time typing this.

Plus, I notice you enjoy fapfapfapping away to some funny shit. Sicko.

;)"
,plibdiggle,2012-08-29T14:38Z,"regarding the download, its not as crap as some may say. sure the bottom of the screen is a little cut off, but at least its reasonably watchable and sound is mostly in sinc. 

its a screener ffs."
,Canon07,2012-08-29T23:33Z,Richard Ayoade is a fcuken good actor. Love his role in I.T Crowd. Apparently we will still see a season 5 
,Canon07,2012-08-29T23:38Z,"Oh,  Chris Tucker was considered for the role but the decided on Richard Ayoade instead. "
,isashisha,2012-08-30T21:19Z,PURE CRAP! its cut in half...peoples heads are going across the screen...what a waste!
,NikkiNanton,2012-09-04T21:38Z,Just wondering if one individual recorded the half of screen movie and shared it with the rest of the uploaders. you can't tell me everyone that uploads movies caught only half of screen smh. If i knew how to do what the uploaders does i would of been known as the best uploader with the best quality movies than all the others. I would of been on top of things y not do the same if it's crap don't bother upload the movie. My opinion :)
,gduzzit,2012-09-07T02:52Z,"i see you fucks have your spidey powers to be talking shit about richard lol ,,,,,.....,,,,,"
,sujan1995,2012-09-07T18:22Z,"I agree this is bad print..but you can't miss this perfect movie..
I searched and found better quality at film.nenadic.com  and just finished to watch it..
Amazing :)"
,Dr_Dassler,2012-09-13T05:10Z,"To all the mongs commenting on Richard Ayoade. This movie will have been created for him just so they could get him in a Hollywood movie. The Yanks all know where the real comedic talent is. If you don't know who he is, you're basically acknowledging that you are an ignorant bell-end."
,brolysfate,2012-09-14T16:51Z,"This file has a VERY hidden virus, nothing was picked up at first, then finally I deleted the entire file and everything went back to normal. I checked everything too. this virus is very hard to find."
,tumjum13,2012-09-15T23:04Z,"I see a lot of people bashing this film for some reason. Sure it's not some cinematic masterpiece; when I went to see it I wasn't expecting that. ""The Watch"" is a funny buddy comedy, filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller, Vaughn, the rest of the cast, and writer Seth Rogen. I saw it on freefree.noahw.org because of better quality and i can recommend this movie to all of you, great one! "
