,preda96,2012-08-15T17:19Z,"The nfo says texture are lossless, so does that mean the graphics are worse? Please someone reply. Thanks"
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-15T17:28Z,"@preda96 : Lossless means it is untouched.
So in this case, Videos, Texture, audio is untouched."
,The012Freak,2012-08-15T18:07Z,"@Falconsflight

Yes BB version includes DLC..."
,preda96,2012-08-15T18:10Z,@Mr.Stifmeister Allright. Thanks man for torrent. Downloading it now
,icero93,2012-08-16T04:59Z,hey guys for some reason my copy is REALLY zoomed in does anyone know how to change that without starting the game since i cant see when i start since im like at the crappiest resoluttion
,rhalls28,2012-08-16T06:23Z,"@icero93 
I think you can change that in your graphic card configuration of the .exes
Go there search the exe of this game and try to select the best settings to your computer.
Im downloading it now and I dont know if theres a configurator inside the game folder. Did you search for that?"

,preda96,2012-08-16T15:54Z,"Works perfectly on my gtx 550 ti. Thanks again, great game!"
,DeathWaitsForNobody,2012-08-17T22:31Z,Stifmeister does this contain audio for when they talk? because my other torrent Does not. and its annoying the hell out of me because its not working properly
,pdmee,2012-08-18T02:58Z,So is this version clean or not? someone just posted there's a trojan in it.
,Asshole88,2012-08-18T06:02Z,"It's clean. All trojans people post on bigtime torrents like this as just false positives. They have been for years. If you see EVERYONE complaining about a virus, then that's when you worry."
,hammer2085,2012-08-18T09:51Z,"Downloaded & Installed! 

Install Time is about 25 min on Core i3.

Working Fine :)"
,pingon55555,2012-08-18T17:36Z,"@icero93

It's not as complicated as you might think, go into the game, graphics options (little TV icon), then change your resolution there to w/e you want. Mine also came distorted, until I changed it. Also the controls are not found in the main menu settings. Instead you need to be in game and then press ""O"", that will bring your inventory up, that has your skills, and keys used to perform different actions. Anyways GL and have fun!"
