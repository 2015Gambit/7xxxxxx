This Is The Full Fraps it can record as much as you want unlike the free version 

that can record only one minute 

this is the single user license and dont worry evreyone can use it whenever they 

like (The Registration details are not myn) you dont need to worry just use fraps 

you have evreything you need 

Tips:

Put Your Bencmark Settings To FPS

Put Video Capture Setting Replace The 29.99  With 120 And Select That

Turn Off "Force lossless RGB capture (may be slower)

Chose Full-size if you have a lot disk space 

And All The Hotkeys Are Changable

The Black Box (Overlay Corner) Says In Which Corner Are The Numbers Gonna Be

You Can Change Intu Any Corner You LIke And If You Dont Know WHat Numbers Im Talking 

About Just Start Fraps And Start The Game And Youl See The Green Numbers

When Theye Green That Means Youre Not Recording When Theyre Red That Means Youre 

Recording

You Start Recording By Clicking Your Asigned Bencmark Hotkey (Defual F11)

You Can Also Hide The Overley (Numbers) But Then You Will Not Know For Sure If Youre 

Recording Or Not

And It Doesnt Matter If The Overlay is Hidden Or Not The Numbers Will Not Appear 

In Youre Video That You Recorded With Fraps



IMPORTANT: If you have Fraps Turned On in youre games and the numbers are showing

and youre gonna record that game with some other recording software with the 

numbers visible they will appear in the video you recorded with that other 

recording software.
