English subs.

Beautiful and deeply moving film. 2004 version. 
During the Second World War, a Frenchman and his grand-daughter, in a small occupied French village by the sea, put up a silent yet fierce resistance against the German officer and loger who's been foisted on them by the local Kommandantur.
