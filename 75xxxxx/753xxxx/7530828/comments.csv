,3Dazz,2012-08-14T07:03Z,"@PattieLennon, the John Lennon segment will be in Part 2. Be up soon."
,Froglet,2012-08-14T15:51Z,"Thanks 3Dazz

One question, where did you record it from? Presumably not the BBC, or you would have no ads to remove."
,Froglet,2012-08-14T16:12Z,"Silly question, of course, it's in 3D, so it cannot be the BBC."
,3Dazz,2012-08-15T11:12Z,"@ Froglet, it was recorded from a TV channel called 93D which was only broadcasting for a few hours a day in Australia. The channel stopped transmission as soon as the Closing Ceremony was broadcast. They claim they were getting it from the British broadcaster."
,KarpoofdaJulii,2012-08-16T08:57Z,"Anyone know what happened to the other Closing Ceremony torrents? There were like a half dozen of them and they've all disappeared, these are the only ones up."
