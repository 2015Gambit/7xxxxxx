This is part 1 of 3 of the Closing Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. The process is the same as my upload of the Opening Ceremony, recorded by PVR, ads removed with Video ReDo and joined and converted with DivX Pro. 
I would like to make sure that you all know about the audio before I get any negative comments.
You can clearly hear the commentators throughout this video, but the audio sounds like it's coming directly from the stadium itself. Occasionally, the audio switches to a direct feed for the performers and changes back at random.
This makes for a less than pleasant audio experience.
I only got one chance to record this before the 3D channel closed, so this is the best I could get.
