,ranjiet,2012-09-07T12:14Z,"Installed fine, got the thing to activate, but for some reason, says my subscription ends on 2/24/2013 (instead of 9/6/2013)! Not sure what's goin on there!
But until the 24th of Feb, my computer is secured!!!

Thanks!"
,ngk_kush,2012-09-09T10:15Z,"yeah, if you're installing this security software, you must uninstall all others in order for it to work properly. Having more than one can cause system instability and crash."
,blooper123,2012-09-13T11:18Z,"I followed the instructions, but it doesn't install anything. I've uninstalled other antivirus and security software, and nothings have worked. Help"
