                     SOME INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE ANDROID 


Android is an operating system for mobile devices that includes
middle ware and key applications, and uses a modified version of the Linux kernel.
It was initially developed by Android Inc., a firm later purchased by Google, and
lately by the Open Handset Alliance. It allows developers to write managed code
in the Java language, controlling the device via Google-developed Java libraries.

ΓÇó The Android operating system software stack consists of Java applications
running on a Java based object oriented application framework on top of Java
core libraries running on a Dalvik virtual machine featuring JIT compilation.
Libraries written in C include the surface manager, OpenCore media framework,
SQLite relational database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API,
WebKit layout engine, SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android
operating system consists of 12 million lines of code including 3 million lines of XML,
2.8 million lines of C, and 2.1 million lines of Java.
