,hammer2085,2012-08-17T05:46Z,"Hey Nil, is editing Windows 8 same as editing Windows 7 as you have shown in your youtube video? Like using gimagex, vlite, rtlite, etc?"
,nileshtambe,2012-08-17T09:03Z,"@hammer2085 
no no,i manually edited with gimagex
rt lite will not work,vlite u can use for removing some components , wintool kit u can use for tweaks and  to enable dot net 3.5 in 32 bit only,

i had hard time in enabling .net 3.5 in 64 but eventually done it manually wintool kit is no use for 64 bit 

this iso contains all dot net till date like
1 , 2 , 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 all of this by default  "

,dadme001,2012-09-16T22:54Z,"Please make a version without removed drivers. Tried on my laptop, but old intel express 4 drivers are only included in windows 8 install.wim, intel doesen't provide other drivers on intel download center. And i have strange rectangular signs on touch keyboard in place of ctrl, alt and other keys."
