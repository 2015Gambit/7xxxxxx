Description:

Iron Brigade is a co-operative mech combat/tower defense game developed by  Double Fine Productions that pits players in powerful, hulking  bipedal tanks called "Mobile Trenches" up against machines made out of televisions called "  Monovisions" (because there's only one channel). The  four-player game proceeds in waves and is a split between light Trench combat and some  tower-defense-like  turret placement. Turrets and other objects can be placed around the map and upgraded. Players spend scrap -- broken TVs that pop out of enemies when they're defeated -- to build additional turrets. The game was developed using a version of the same technology behind  Br√ºtal Legend.
