,taranee,2012-09-03T07:28Z,"never mind you need to download this codec if you don't wont to instal real player

,tfgm,2012-09-07T08:32Z,"Definitely no need for realplayer I am sorry I didn't explain people will need realcodecs installed. I thought most codec packs, like klite, included them. You need codecs installed for all video files.
Also there are players such as vlc which have all codecs internally and will play almost all formats including rmvb.

srt is a subtitle file and will load automatically with most players."
