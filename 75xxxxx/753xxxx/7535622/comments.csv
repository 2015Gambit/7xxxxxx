,mortenmhp,2012-08-16T14:11Z,"asd-08 and everyone requesting the pro version:

This image provides both the core and the pro version. Installing using either of the keys provided by the uploader in an ealier comment will give you the corresponding version of windows 8(with the ability to change it later).

These are, as mentioned, the original MSDN images, and they can be installed using either the retail keys or the VL keys.(the keys posted are retail keys)

Neither key will successfully activate, so using the VL key will require you to find a working KMS-server(non online at this point) and using the retail keys will require you to activate windows later using an OEM-loader if one becomes available.(seemes unlikely at this time given the improved security of the OEM activation process).

For good measure here is the default keys allowing you to install this as both core and pro as well as retail and VL:

Retail
Core = FB4WR-32NVD-4RW79-XQFWH-CYQG3
Professional = XKY4K-2NRWR-8F6P2-448RF-CRYQH

Volume
gvlkCore=BN3D2-R7TKB-3YPBD-8DRP2-27GG4
gvlkProfessional=NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4"
