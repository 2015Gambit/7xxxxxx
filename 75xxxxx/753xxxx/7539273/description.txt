From the Infowars web site ::

Today on the exciting Thursday, August 16 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex is joined by American trend forecaster, business consultant and author Gerald Celente. He joins Alex to discuss the accelerating economic meltdown that could ultimately lead to Martial Law being declared. 

Alex is also joined by actor, stand-up comedian and author Richard Belzer. Mr. Belzer has an expansive career as an actor and has appeared in NBC police dramas such as Homicide: Life on the Street and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Mr. Belzer is also the co-author of Dead Wrong: Straight Facts on the Country's Most Controversial Cover-Ups.
