This may or may not put some people off (I know I personally prefer clean versions) - but you still have all the audio in English so it's not as if it removes any humour aspect. It just can be frustrating when you don't know Hindi (or whatever language the subs are in).

Other than that, thanks very much for the upload, only person I've seen on TPB who has uploaded this! :D"

,ivggyrt,2012-08-21T22:56Z,A quick Google search says the subtitles are Welsh so fairly sure its a joke
