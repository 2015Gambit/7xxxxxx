But why do you try to morally bribe downloaders into thanking you? I think this will only work counterproductive. Don't do this to yourself."

""why do you try to morally bribe downloaders into thanking you""

You must have misread the description
NOWHERE does it ask anyone to thank me 

It asks downloaders to return and comment on the QUALITY

This is to help ""YOU"" the downloaders not to waste time or bandwidth if it's low quality.

Of course you will be returning to do this, won't you!"
,antignor,2012-08-17T18:30Z,"See the +1? That was me. That was already there when you posted your response.
And I already said I appreciate your work. You post BBC stuff other people don't, not even MVGroup, care about to share I really like to see and which my cable-TV provider doesn't provide (BBC4), like this series.

""I will only upload more eps in this series if this gets enough comments"" is what I perceive as moral bribing. In the rest of your statements you say that if people don't leave a comment that you will take this as that they don't like it or appreciate your work. This is like saying that if it isn't white then it's black.

I think many people see torrents as some kind of web-download, as if the file comes from a webserver, not from people donating their bandwidth. So as long as people share it that means people like the series, the quality of your work and the affords you put into it making them enough to do so.

On Demonoid I once uploaded a torrent that was completed over 2000, close to 2500 times. I received maybe 8 comments at max (they were very positive though, because it was pretty rare material at that time and nowhere on torrent yet).
That's how the world turns. Don't be so upset about it, you'll get depressed."

I try to post a torrent per day.
It means I can't really waste my upload speed on stuff people don't really want and it could be used on a new torrent.

As TPB is blocked in the UK (For some reason it has not been for the last couple of days) I post on all the main trackers. It's the same Description used on all. Other sites have a better system than TPB.

Of all the trackers and posting over 6000 torrents TPB is the lowest on any feedback. Strange for a site that is referred to as the number 1

No doubt TPB will be block again in the next few days so I can't post here. You'll need to look elsewhere for more of my torrents

I try to post interesting stuff you can watch again and again rather than eps of Xfactor or Big Brother"
,antignor,2012-08-18T01:57Z,"Maybe I just got your intentions wrong. If so I'm sorry. You could explicitly mention your bandwidth limitations in the description so people have better insight into why you say what you say. Now you just seem a bit angry or frustrated with that ""either white or black"" statement.

And I've seen you around lately since I migrated from Demonoid (you were there as well I believe) and I see you do a lot of good work. TPB maybe just doesn't have the most grateful community, I don't know.  On D'noid, as I described, the gratefulness wasn't made that explicit all the time either and I think it's not really all that different in between communities, but your experiences might be different. I many times bookmark what I've downloaded so I can easily come back to rate and/or say thanks (though I do not do that always either), many people may just forget about it after they've downloaded the torrent or magnet and live happily ever after.

I had a torrent uploaded at KAT which was deleted for copyright problems. Then I uploaded it here with the same torrent file I used at KAT and the already existing swarm was shared. So in fact it shouldn't make that much difference on how many sites you upload as long as they allow public trackers, and your bandwidth problems may get less when you use the 'initial seeder' option in utorent (which you maybe already do).

Bu I do really appreciate your work and hope you will continue to make at least me happy. but when I see the amount of seeders and leechers I'm by far from the only one!"
