[b][color=Red] [center]Please Return and add a comment on the [/color][color=Black]quality[/color] [color=Red].

I will only upload more eps in this series if this gets enough comments

NO or lack of comments I'll take as 
"You did not like the quality"
"You did not like the series"
"You have no manners"

I put a lot of effort into my TVrips
Unlike most posted TVrips my BBC rips have full endings
I don't like squashed credits with announcer talk-over
I fix this before posting, so mine are more like DVDrips than TVrips
