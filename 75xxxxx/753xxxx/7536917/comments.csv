That error is about DirectX or Video card issue or NetFramweork or Visual C++ not about game itself "

You cannot play this game without this http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555

If you have a newer version you must uninstall it first then install that version .Is about Visual C++ Redistributable. Also if you have installed Visual C++ 2010 Express  you must uninstall it."

you cannot be banned for trying to play a game pirated but you CANNOT play that game ,Steam is blocking game"
,Bilaras4Ever,2012-08-26T09:08Z,ok thanks
,spasitel1,2012-09-01T10:40Z,"i DON't know why, but i install the game, do patches, install c++. Even though netframe wont launch properly, it keeps showing that some CreateInterface in steam.api folder is missing. I don't know how to solve this, so pls help me. Also, I have momentarily windows 8 installed, consumer preview edition. Could this be an issue?"
