***By judging from the way the crowd is present & ambient (it doesn't sound 
like they're coming through the stage microphones to me) this is a MATRIX.  
It's quite possible it's from this source despite the way Charlie labled it 
(either way, Charlie Miller is a living legend in the trader world):
