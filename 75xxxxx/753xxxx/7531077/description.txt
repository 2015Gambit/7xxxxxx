"This is for all you folks out there, who want to learn the magic art of Assembly programming." - MAD

Introduction
I have just started learning Windows assembly programming yesterday, and this tutorial is being written while I'm learning the language. I am learning assembly from reading various tutorials online, reading books, and ask questions in newsgroups and IRC. There are a lot of assembly programming tutorials online, but this tutorial will focus on Windows programming in x86 assembly. Knowledge of higher level programming languages and basic knowledge of computer architecture is assumed.
