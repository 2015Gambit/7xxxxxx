SHA1?"
,Myspar,2012-08-13T23:46Z,"Hi ""kgee2012""!

Thank you for comment.

I will try explain,

Hash: Hash functions are mostly used to accelerate table lookup or data comparison tasks such as finding items in a database, detecting duplicated or similar records in a large file, finding similar stretches in DNA sequences, and so on.

SHA-1: SHA-1 is a algorithm for cryptographic hash function.

With number SHA-1 we can compare the sequence of binary code from 2 files to make sure it is legitimate and has not been modified.

TechNET give us the SHA-1 code, to confirm get in:
