Interviews with 30 people who knew and worked with Curtis, including Penny Arcade, Joe Dallesandro, Harvey Fierstein, Joe Franklin, Taylor Mead, Paul Morrissey, Sylvia Miles, Jack Mitchell, Michael Musto, Ellen Stewart, Lily Tomlin, John Vaccaro and Holly Woodlawn.

Rare footage includes: never before seen excerpts from Curtis' plays "Vain Victory", "Femme Fatale", and "Glamour, Glory and Gold", plus excerpts of the legendary 1974 "Cabaret in the Sky - An evening with Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis", and hundreds of never-before-published photos of Jackie, Candy, Holly, Joe Dallesandro, Andy Warhol, Paul Morrissey and many others.


Village Voice:
The multi-talented gender-blur diva Jackie Curtis was too down-to-earth to qualify as a sacred monster, but Dusan Makavejev ΓÇö who directed the performer in W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism ΓÇö would later remark that he was "in a kind of permanent awe before Jackie, as religious people might feel in the face of Jesus." That's one way to characterize Curtis's sassy, wisecracking persona.

Years in the making, Craig Highberger's Superstar in a Housedress is a fabulously fond and entertaining tribute to the quick-witted Lower East Side kid, the son of a taxi dancer and a marine, who grew up above his grandmother's Second Avenue saloon and reinvented himself as a superstar well before he met Andy Warhol. Although inevitably bracketed with fellow Warhol drag queens and Women in Revolt co-stars Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn, Curtis promoted a funkier styleΓÇöthrift-store dresses with padded shoulders, but not falsies ΓÇö that was more the idea of drag than drag itself. As Voice fashion columnist Blair Sobol wrote nearly 30 years ago, "Jackie came before Bette Midler with the '40s feeling of a Rita redhead, the Joan Crawford flaming mouth, and the Ann Sheridan padded shoulders. Jackie taught me how to put glitter on my eyelids and how to wear torn pantyhose with style."
