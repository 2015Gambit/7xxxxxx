A Year in the Wild
The breathtaking landscapes and spectacular wildlife of some of Britain's most iconic National Parks, seen through the eyes of people who know them best, Hermione Norris purrs narration over enchanting images of the crags and valleys of the National Parks. The film takes a dim view of the tourists who flock to the area, but sorry, programmes like this will only encourage us.


1)  Snowdonia 
The breathtaking landscapes and spectacular wildlife of Snowdonia National Park, seen through the eyes of people who know it best. Snowdonia is Wales' most dramatic wild place and one of the most beautiful and best loved in the whole of Britain. It's a land of extinct volcanoes surrounded by the Irish Sea, a spellbinding landscape whose peaks are some of the most ancient on the planet and whose valleys are a refuge for rare and fascinating wildlife including otters, hen harriers and peregrine falcons. This film follows a farmer, a National Park warden, a climber and a poet throughout the year and, through their intimate knowledge of Snowdonia, explores the nature of wilderness in modern Britain.
