
Plot: Kirsten Dunst, Isla Fisher and Lizzy Caplan star in this comedy about three dysfunctional friends who attempt to leave the past behind while serving as bridesmaids at the wedding of a girl they mocked mercilessly back in high school. As teenagers, Regan (Dunst), Gena (Caplan) and Katie (Fisher) used to call Becky (Rebel Wilson) Pig Face. A few years later, Becky is about to tie the knot, and calls on her taunting former classmates to join the wedding party. And though Regan is determined to give Becky a bachelorette bash she’ll never forget, tart-tongued Gena has already started partying hard well before the big night, and capricious Katie seems to have her head stuck in the clouds. Later, as the ladies cut loose and the booze begins to flow, a mishap with the wedding dress sends the entire event spiraling out of control, leading to a wild night of debauchery that neither the bride nor her bridesmaids will ever forget.
