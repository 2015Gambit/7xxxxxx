Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is facing new scrutiny over revelations he founded the private equity firm Bain Capital with investments from Central American elites linked to death squads in El Salvador. 

After initially struggling to find investors, Romney traveled to Miami in 1983 to win pledges of $9 million, 40 percent of BainΓÇÖs start-up money. 

Some investors had extensive ties to the death squads responsible for the vast majority of the tens of thousands of deaths in El Salvador during the 1980s. 

WeΓÇÖre joined by Huffington Post reporter Ryan Grim, who connects the dots in his latest story, "Mitt Romney Started Bain Capital With Money From Families Tied To Death Squads." 

"ThereΓÇÖs no possible way that anybody in 1984 could check out these families ΓÇö which was the term that [RomneyΓÇÖs campaign] used ΓÇö and come away convinced that this money was clean," Grim says.
