,xpmule,2012-08-13T10:38Z,"I guarantee 101% rock solid this release and this torrent by this user tonyisaac is completly fully working and legit as stated episode 5 season 5 period.

I'm not asking if anyone is agreeing with me, I AM STATING A FACT PERIOD !

Download and enjoy or contact TPB staff about having my account removed. If I'm wrong then ban me ;)"
,upinthisbitch18,2012-08-13T10:41Z,this is real. no password :) thank you tonyisaac
,xpmule,2012-08-13T10:43Z,"the reason your seeing so many seeders etc is because this is listed at places such as
http://eztv.it/
go and look for yourself and you will see the magnet link at eztv matches this specific torrent.
I grabbed this file from another torrent at TPB (the ettv  upload) and i added it to this one and forced a re-check and it said complete so i watched the damn thing lol
It is legit and good no password or anything."
,jecker75,2012-08-13T16:41Z,upload is 10000% legit.  no password works great!! thanks uploader!!!
,nosnavis,2012-08-14T16:57Z,"If someone is lying about the torrent's characteristics (saying things like ""you need a password"" and you don't), is probably a corporate minion.
