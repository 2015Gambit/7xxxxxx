Star Trek 2009 HEARABLE DIALOG with Rifftrax Commentary

This is a re-post of the recent re-post of "rifftrax_startrek2009".

I have reprocessed the audio track so the movie dialog is now hear-able.

So now you can understand dialog based the jokes! 
(Which is about 75% of the jokes the Riffers do.)

BTW: This is my first upload ever.  

Hope it works.

I will seed it for a week or so.


Anyway...give to Rifftrax if you can.
