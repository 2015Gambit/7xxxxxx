[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-11T13:40Z,"@Alpha.Omega

You can try this activator it has more servers and maybe they are still online."
,shadohchaser,2012-08-11T15:16Z,bobi I hope ur not a hacker bitch coz ur previous activators haven't worked & Windows 8 don't have antivirus security essentials just inbuilt defender if u fucking up my new SSD karma is a bitch!! x((
,nemmo007,2012-08-11T15:33Z,Not working
,nemmo007,2012-08-11T15:35Z,Microsoft Security Essentials it's integrated in Windows Defender for Windows 8. so we DO have an antivirus.
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-11T16:01Z,"@shadohchaser

Come on why you must think something like that?Just see my uploads.About activators i always upload the latest official activators."
,Alpha.Omega,2012-08-11T16:08Z,"@bobiras22:
i have nothing againts, esp. this is fr 7pm >> its safe, what i wanted to tell is as long as MS did block all win8 activations and unless there will be an online KMS, the rest of activators is a garbage."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-11T16:16Z,"@Alpha.Omega

I think the servers get online some hours a day.If you succed to activate just one time you wont needed to do it again.Just one lucky time."

always gets erro no key management service could be contacted...
plz help
sorry for my english"
,shadohchaser,2012-08-14T15:42Z,"bobi I trust you ok thanks You my friend many thanks for this! :D

but I doing some googling & it telling me this KMS activation always phones home every 30 days & limit is 180 days.

And it must contact this SAME server of KMS to renew!!

So MS just remove 1 KMS server & its KAPUT!

What we need is a MASTER OEM key which OEM's use on Windows which come pre-installed they are activated by default & even if they call home it doesn't matter coz its MASTER KEY.

This KMS shit is like just COA sticker key which comes on new PC's it MUST phone home every 30/180 days to re-arm as they say!

Someone said KMS can be emulated in HYPER-V windows 8 so you always do this every 180 days you call the KMS server in HYPER V as in run your own...like trick windows into thinking its MS server.

So someone put guide how to run KMS Win8 server in HyperV on desktop? I have shit computer laying around I'll turn it into KMS server for myself.

I have never paid for any MS software IN MY LIFE! Neither did my DAD nor will my KIDS! :D

It either comes free pre-installed or that is it. Never gonna BUY software from MS! 

I like to keep this family tradition & so does everyone else! :D

So we NEED OEM MASTER KEY or HyperV Emulated Win8 KMS server!

Please EXPERTS GIVE IT TO US! :D"

,jackjake,2012-08-16T23:49Z,"@ gErMzKill

If it is pro edition this is suppose to work:
1. Set TCP/IPv4 server addresses:
 Preffered DNS server: 8 . 8 . 8 . 8
 Alternate DNS server: 8 . 8 . 4 . 4

 2. Restart the system. (restarting PC is important)

 3. Run cmd as administrator.

 4 Enter following commands: 
 slmgr.vbs -ipk ng4hw-vh26c-733kw-k6f98-j8ck4
 slmgr -skms benderrodriguez-1-pt.tunnel.tserv28.waw1.ipv6.he.net
 slmgr -ato 

I installed Enterprise edition by doing this:
1. Set TCP/IPv4 server addresses:
 Preffered DNS server: 8 . 8 . 8 . 8
 Alternate DNS server: 8 . 8 . 4 . 4

 2. Restart the system. (restarting PC is important)

 3. Run cmd as administrator.

 4 Enter following commands: 
 slmgr.vbs -ipk 32JNW-9KQ84-P47T8-D8GGY-CWCK7
 slmgr -skms benderrodriguez-1-pt.tunnel.tserv28.waw1.ipv6.he.net
 slmgr -ato   

I only changed the serial key to fit Ent editon.
Every time I tried it after that I only used ""slmgr -ato"" and it finally accepted it. 

You may have to find a new kms server if this one is down permanantly, but I'd keep trying it for a while. 
Good Luck. "
