Excerpt from Amazon UK's review by Caitlin Moran:

"Putting aside the Girl Power phenomenon--really, what were
the chances five scantily-clad birds flashing their
knickers with kung-fu kicks wouldn't make it in the music
industry?--the Spice Girls really do mean something: great
singles. There's not a dog in their whole back-catalogue.
They kicked off their career with Wannabe, Say You'll Be
There and 2 Become 1--that's the pop equivalent of an
Olympic gold in the triathlon. They're all here on Spice,
along with the live favourite If You Can't Dance--one that
Geri always looked particularly picked-upon whilst singing
--and that irresistible champagne effervescence of pop
history in the making."
