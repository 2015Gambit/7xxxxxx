,CrystalizedFears,2012-08-14T06:14Z,"Works like a charm. Although I don't know where to find the 'Advanced Heuristic Analysis and Detection' option.

Where exactly in the Configuration menu is it?

Either way, good torrent."
,Ghayyurious,2012-08-14T16:48Z,"^ you're welcome.
Its located rite here..
Extras--> Configuration--> Enable Expert mode--> Expand Real time protection--> Expand Scan--> Click on Heuristic --> Then Uncheck ""Enable AHead"" --> Click Apply then Ok.."

,sanadbenali222,2012-08-21T22:02Z,sir you are a true patriot  thanks as always never seeze to amaze us  how do you generate them?
,Ghayyurious,2012-08-22T13:46Z,"You're Welcome sanadbenali222.
How do i generate them?
Well, its my little secret.. :)"
,Ghayyurious,2012-08-22T14:06Z,"[Edit]
Here are the NEW instructions.
1.To Prolong Activation Period, u must update your Avira Product manually.(Its for ""PRODUCT UPDATES"", ""Virus Definition Update"" has nothing to do with it)
Open Avira, Extras--> Configuration--> Expand update--> Product update and click ""Notify user when new product are available"". At Below, you must enter at least 3 days or more because if you update regularly, your product key will be expired or being blacklisted soon.


2.To make Scanning Faster (No false-positive), you need to disable the advanced heuristic analysis and detection (AHeaD) located in,
Extras--> Configuration--> Enable Expert mode--> Expand Real time protection--> Expand Scan--> Click on Heuristic --> Then Uncheck ""Enable AHead""
Click Apply then Ok..

3.Enhance your internet Browsing/Downloading speed by performing a clean install of AIS and during the setup uncheck ""Web Protection"" and ""Mail Protection"".
As both don't play a significan't role in protecting your system as ""Firewall"" and ""Scanner"" do."
