 Sunder Srivastava (Shahrukh Khan)aisea young  
  graduate whose main ambition in life is to   
 fulfill his father's dream of starting a      
 school on his half-acre property in his       
 village, though he has no funds to execute    
 his plans. Sunder's childhood friend Prem,    
 a seasoned conman who operates in Bombay,     
 convinces the gullible Sunder to mortgage     
 his land to the village Zamindar (landlord)   
 and fly to Dubai. Prem promises Sunder a      
 handsomely paying teacher's job in Dubai      
 that would give Sunder enough money to start  
 his school within two years. Sunder does as   
 told and arrives in Bombay to meet Prem; not  
 only is there no sign of his friend at the    
 station, but Sunder also gets unwittingly     
 involved with a petty thief who robs him of   
 all his luggage and money. To make matters    
 worse, when Sunder reaches Prem's lodge,      
 he finds an apologetic letter from Prem       
 informing him that he has used his Rs.10,000  
 to get himself to Dubai instead and will      
 one day repay him...
