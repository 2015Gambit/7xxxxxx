Ivo Papazov is a Bulgarian clarinetist. He leads the Ivo Papazov Wedding Band 
in performances of jazz-infused Stambolovo music, and is one of the premier creators 
of the genre known as "wedding band" music in Bulgaria, along with the violinist 
Georgi Yanev, saxophonist Yuri Yunakov and accordionists Neshko Neshev, Ivan Milev 
and Peter Ralchev. Together with Emilia they are known as Mames 2001. An orchestra 
that had great success in the TV show "Guess who is under the table".

According to Garth Cartwright, he was "the first Balkan Gypsy musician to win a 
wide international following with his two Joe Boyd-produced albums for Hannibal 
Records in the early 1990s." Papasov and his Wedding Band have toured the United 
States several times.

In 2005 Papasov won the Audience Award from the BBC's Radio3 World Music Awards.

Ivo Papasov was born to a Gypsy family in Bulgaria and his original name is 
Ibrahim (Turkish name). As a result of the extensive programme of forced 
nationalisation of ethnic minority groups during Bulgaria's socialist rule, 
Papazov changed his first name to Ivo (adapted from Ibo, short for Ibrahim). 
He speaks Turkish and comes from Kardzhali, a city close to BulgariaΓÇÖs Turkish 
and Greek borders. He grew up in a musical family and followed the Balkan 
Gypsy tradition of leaving school at a young age to focus on playing music 
for a living.
