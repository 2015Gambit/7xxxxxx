I have a feeling you didn't completely block Parallels in LittleSnitch and/or hosts file *before* you started installation.

Clean up your install, make sure you block everything Parallels-related from phoning home (Google is your friend), then reinstall.

Or just disable your net connection before you install, but you're still going to *have* to block Parallels from phoning home."
