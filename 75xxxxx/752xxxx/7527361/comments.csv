,MMusic123,2012-08-13T05:08Z,I always have gotten True Blood shows from you and they are real- and you upload aprox 1 hour after the show airs.  Thanks for keeping integrity in what you do. 
,craiglive,2012-08-13T05:08Z,"Since it's ettv, I'm just gonna pretend I already have it and say...

A=10
V=10

Thanks!"

,doublea08,2012-08-13T05:27Z,ettv always comes through. 
,rauldf,2012-08-13T06:00Z,WTF Nobody is seeding ????? 
,mastermalloy,2012-08-13T06:02Z,"We all appreciate your continued honesty in posting the real thing week after week. Thank you so much. If you can, please send out major viruses to all the assholes who post fakes. That would be just as nice."
,rauldf,2012-08-13T06:11Z,I agree with Mastermalloy. But com'on... There are 1735 seeders and over 13 thousand leachers. I am only downloading at 9 kb / sec. Episode 11 will be out by the time I get this.
,wendol1994,2012-08-13T06:12Z,seed plz
,schlierkamp,2012-08-13T06:26Z,"ty so much. I always seed 1:1, sometimes 3:1. if you're dLing, you're seeding, but that doesn't count. if you haven't seeded 1:1 by the time you're finished dLing, then keep seeding. just watch the show and seed. it's not that difficult. you'd make the ""torrent world"" a lot nicer if everyone seeded 1:1."
,badbetty,2012-08-13T06:34Z,"thanks for the upload and thanks to the seeders, a10 v10, pitty so many people leach! will seed for others :)"
,badbetty,2012-08-13T06:37Z,"thanks for the upload and thanks to the seeders, pitty so many ppl leach a10 v10 will seed for the day"

,Doom69,2012-08-14T14:40Z,"Thank you, ettv.

Don't listen to the basement dwellers who try and spread false lies.

Go troll elsewhere tools."
,nosnavis,2012-08-14T16:41Z,"If someone is lying about the torrents' characteristics (saying things like ""you need a password""), is probably a corporate minion.

Please report them in the Forum:

https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=106733

This is happening with the most seeded torrents right now."
,rottencr,2012-08-14T23:47Z,"Actually, the file I downloaded yesterday from ettv (latest episode of True Blood) was a RAR file and needed a password.  Thought it was very weird, so I deleted it, and I'm downloading this one.  

Not sure what was up?  Maybe someone hacked his account?  Could have been legit, but I decided not to mess with it, and get a file I know to be clean.  

And no, I'm not some corporate so and so."
,Es2Kay,2012-08-15T14:38Z,"@rottencr
look at the user's name not the title, the file you're talking about was a fake, uploaded by some moron not ettv"
,hotaru69b,2012-08-18T11:16Z,"Unlike some of the other True Blood episodes I've tried to download today, this one is indeed real.

Careful, as there's a lot of fake rar+survey password running around towards the top of the seeder list. I'm kinda wondering how they got there, without the assistance of a major corporate data center or some such.

This one, however, is real."
,hotaru69b,2012-08-18T23:18Z,"(Comes back next day to see all bullshit rar survey torrents removed...)

Whoever did this... I LOVE YOU AND MUST HAVE YOUR BABBIES!!!!! :D"
,Veece,2012-08-22T23:43Z,Received a copyright infringement letter from this torrent. Just a heads up.
,tunnelsunshine,2012-09-06T11:09Z,"great video quality, but sound was a bit quiet and on the off side, but still over all great! thanks! a 7 v 10!"
