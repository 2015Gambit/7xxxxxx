This show does not appear on Etree.  John Patitucci Electric Band?  Polish TV?  1993?  That is a whole lot of unknows.  If you have additional information speak up and lets flesh this out.  The video quality is not great and it gets worse for the last 10 minutes.  An upgrade must exist so I hope to see it soon. Great performances and great audio.
