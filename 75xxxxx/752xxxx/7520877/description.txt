When a crazed ghostly puritan judge named Hebediah Grimm starts terrorizing
Crystal Cove and judging its youth, the Mystery Inc. gang gets involved...
perhaps a little too deep. Ethan and Gary seem to be reaping the benefits
of these strange attacks as they are rescuing and then dating some of the
prettiest girls in school! This makes them prime suspects but both have
ironclad alibis... both have been seen fighting against Hebediah!
