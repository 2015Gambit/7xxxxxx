NirSoft web site provides a unique collection of small and useful freeware utilities, all of them developed by Nir Sofer.

This is a complete collection of all the applications found on the NirSoft website in one package. All of the applications freeware, but downloading each is a pain, so I have compiled this collection. All versions of each program (x86, x64, etc.) are included where applicable, as well as the .chm help manual for each.

There are 187 applications total (some repeats for different CPU architectures), which have a wide array of functions including password recovery for various products and browsers, tweaking Windows OS, network analysis, registry analysis, and mush more. For a complete list of all the programs, see the complete index on the Nirsoft website.
