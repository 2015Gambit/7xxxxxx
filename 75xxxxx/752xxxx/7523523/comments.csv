You will create the folder Android/obb.Inside the obb folder you will put the folder that i have in the SD Data By bobiras2009.Then launch the game.It will work 100%"
,ylpkm,2012-08-11T23:57Z,"alright.. idk how i got it to work, but i did what you said on the sd card, and also on the phones internal memory. then it worked. then i deleted the FFIII obbs from the internal memory and now it works.. (im not a complete noob to running unsigned apps on various devices.. but im a complete noob to android so yeah) so THIS TORRENT DOES WORK. THANKS BOBIRAS22. "
,ylpkm,2012-08-12T00:27Z,"Ok, For the Droid razr ICS.. I had to put the obb in the internal memory as well for it to work.. just saying if anyone else gets stuck, do that as well"

[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-30T16:40Z,"@Navi2000

First install the apk.then in your external sdcard in android/obb put the folder with the obb file inside.With wifi off open the game"

,LokiXP,2012-09-03T01:31Z,"I had issues on my Galaxy S2 (that I've updated to a custom ICS ROM), it wanted to download content even though I had copied the folder to sdcard/data/obb as well as /sdcard/ext_sd/data/obb

So what I did was use lucky patcher's permissions setting to remove the Internet setting from FF3, left the wifi_state though, and now it works like a charm and cant use the internet!"
