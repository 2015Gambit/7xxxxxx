QC 48 - Aufbau building of Elements

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The aufbau elemental building process is explained.

A detailed 3D model is developed providing exploded, polar and side elevations of any periodic element along with detailed information of their quantum numbers and inter-relationships with each other.

The forty -eighth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
