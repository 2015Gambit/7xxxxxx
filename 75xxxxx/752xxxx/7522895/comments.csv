Volume MAK Key for Enterprise VL
 PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C 

 How to activate your Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise:

 1. Run cmd as admin. Enter slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C (Only for Enterprise and Pro)
 2. Turn off your internet connection
 3. Open activation window and click ""Activate"". It'll show your an error.
 4. After that you'll see ""Activate by phone"" button.
 5.  i used united kingdom for the country, Call microsoft and enter code from message, which you will see.
 6. you should choose for business, If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1

this should work and your w8 should be activated for good. goodluck!"
