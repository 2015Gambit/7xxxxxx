Editorial review from Amazon.com:

Minnie Riperton's untimely death from breast cancer (in 1979 at the age of 32) robbed the world of one its truly great, truly distinctive voices. Her operatically-trained, five-octave instrument was the very model of beauty and control. Consequently, her signature tune, "Lovin' You," is likely the breeziest bit of pop you may ever hear. In addition to her own songs, Riperton also makes light work of material as lovely and strong as Stevie Wonder's "Perfect Angel" and Joni Mitchell's "Woman of Heart and Mind." The only misstep on this collection, in fact, is yet another unnecessary take of The Doors' "Light My Fire." --Michael Ruby
