quality is always great
a/v9/10"
,corbryant,2012-08-13T07:49Z,"Ditto.  Just wanted to say thanks as well.  You're doing a really good service to a lot of people who genuinely got screwed with these cut offs in the U.S.   Quite a few people lost AMC and quite a few other channels from their cable providers because the pigs wouldn't pay a few bucks more to keep them for their subscribers.  My damn bill is $150 a month for phone, cable and net.  The least they can do is let me watch Breaking Bad!  So yeah, you're awesome!  All I have to do is wait an extra hour and BAM, there it is every week.  =)  "
,fry2077,2012-08-13T08:11Z,"I got rid of my cable provider because it was just getting so expensive, and every time I would negotiate with them to get a lower price it would seem like they would take off the channels I actually watch like AMC, but keep the stupid infomercial and spanish-speaking channels that I never watch."
