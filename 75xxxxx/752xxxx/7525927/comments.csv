,Socram484,2012-08-16T20:29Z,"Can anyone confirm that this works? Is there a way to know that it's successfully cracked? I'm trying to run a test application on my phone, and it never finds the device, even though I know USB debugging is working correctly on the phone. Which makes me wonder if it is working (since this is a given limitation of the trial)."
,Socram484,2012-08-16T20:30Z,"Thanks for the work regardless, it's awesome that you always have the latest version uploaded."
,aett,2012-08-16T21:02Z,"Yes, this is confirmed working."
,Xtse,2012-08-18T16:01Z,"@Socram484: I guess just make sure you have the debugging drivers installed on your PC (if your phone requires it). If you're using a Samsung phone, Kies does that for you when installed."
