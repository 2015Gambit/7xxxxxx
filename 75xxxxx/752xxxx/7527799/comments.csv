,mlsz,2012-08-17T02:04Z,"it is a leak, but not the real release that microsoft released august 15.

micrisofts offical build hs different size and hashes.
this one is fake. not the real deal but a leak."
,mlsz,2012-08-17T02:07Z,"Look, ghostnet. the offical Microsoft ISO released on  Aug 15 - that's the real DEAL. yours is just a fake rtm leak. for your information the real MDSN offical microsoft build has this file name and this hash.

so don't be snotty with me the next time."
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-08-17T21:17Z,"u think you know everthing u idiot.Have u ever seen games or softwares released by scene groups .they make there their own iso with a crack or activition bypass in it,so how can u expect them to have same hash. 
can u see in any of the above description were it says that it is the original iso ?( No!!)

so if u can't read and understand the description so please get the hell out of here and stop making useless comments here.

and making other people confused!!!."
,mlsz,2012-08-17T21:48Z,"i can read and understand. this scene release is not the final official version... i checked and yet your still bitchin.

the real deal is as of now on piratebay. the torrent is called Visual Studio 2012 ISO - MSDN and includes all official releases. no need for any cracks in that one either. 100 % clean.
"
,mlsz,2012-08-17T21:50Z,"with that im not gonna comment on your torrent no more, because you clearly can't handle it."
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-08-17T22:04Z,this the FINAL release u idiot go spam some where else
