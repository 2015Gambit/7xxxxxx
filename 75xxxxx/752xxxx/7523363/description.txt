Ozan is a ten-year old boy living in a small coastal town on the Aegean. His friends make fun of him, calling him an ΓÇ£infidelΓÇ¥ because his grandfather Mehmet is an immigrant from Crete. Ozan is afraid of being left alone. He gets angry at his family, especially his grandfather, and he stubbornly challenges his family saying ΓÇ£We are TurksΓÇ¥.

Mehmet Bey, OzanΓÇÖs grandfather, is a respected shopkeeper in the community. He takes the people of the town under his wings, and helps them with their problems. Mehmet Bey is known for his tolerance and his grandsonΓÇÖs attitude not only has him worried but grieves him as well.

Mehmet Bey and his family were torn from their land and forced to migrate from Crete during the population exchange when he was just seven years old. Mehmet BeyΓÇÖs greatest desire is to see the land of his birth before he dies. It is this longing that makes him frequently drop bottles containing letters into the turquoise waters of the Aegean.

DEDEM─░N ─░NSANLARI describes the spectacular transformation of a family and their country through the eyes of a ten-year old child and his grandfather living in a small town.
