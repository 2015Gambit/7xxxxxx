,rbrucea777,2012-08-13T04:57Z,"thanks!!
 ya know i made my own cassettes
in the audience but i was afraid the whole time
that i would be thrown out
i wish i still had them
that was the night Jimmy's guitar became unplugged during the Violin Bowstring action and you could only hear the stage monitor
it was a great show!!"
