"Le Sacre du Printemps' was one of Leonard Bernstein's first stereo recordings with the New York Philharmonic. The recording was released in 1958, the year the first stereo LPs came on the market. Four years earlier, RCA, 
followed by other companies, released the first stereo recordings to the public in two-track open-reel tapeform. Bernstein's "Le Sacre" quickly became a demonstration item, due to its colorful orchestration and excellent 
dynamic range. The recording was issued in mono and in stereo on disc and open-reel track.

Stravinsky, who had been greatly upset by some performances of the piece, most notably Leopold Stokowski's version in "Fantasia," was apparently taken with Bernstein's interpretation. He reportedly greeted the recording with the one-word reaction, "Wow!" 

This is a transfer of the 1958 two-track factory pre-recorded open-reel - Columbia LMB24. It is a genuine rarity and is offered for its musical interest and interest as an early artifact of the stereo era.
