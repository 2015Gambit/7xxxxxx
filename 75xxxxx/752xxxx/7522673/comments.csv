Per WIKIPEDIA for Initial Seeding( aka Super Seeding):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding
NOTE: Initial Seeding is NOT for those who do not have a FULL copy of the torrent. If you use Initial Seeding while DL'ing torrents, you'll choke yourself to slow speeds - and if you use upload speed less than 50kb. So, be wise, be generous and courteous. SEED! ;p"
