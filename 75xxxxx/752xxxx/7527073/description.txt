The science of hamsa
is the science of the Self.
It is the source of all knowledge.
It is God's gift to us.
Repeat it with respect.
		Sit very quietly.
Become aware of the breath
coming in and going out
repeating hamsa, hamsa.
Understand that ham is the perfect I,
the pure Consciousness.
Understand that sa is the universal energy.
Focus subtly
on the place where these syllables
arise and subside,
and you will know the Self.
This is the true state of God.
You are That.
