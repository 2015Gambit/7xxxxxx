Elcomsoft Phone Password Breaker enables forensic access to password-protected backups for smartphones and portable devices based on RIM BlackBerry and Apple iOS platforms. The password recovery tool supports all Blackberry smartphones as well as Apple devices running iOS including iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices of all generations released to date, including the latest iPhone 4 and iOS 4.1.

Unlock Apple and BlackBerry Backups
The new tool recovers the original plain-text passwords protecting encrypted backups for Apple and BlackBerry devices. The backups contain address books, call logs, SMS archives, calendars and other organizer data, camera snapshots, voice mail and email account settings, applications, Web browsing history and cache.

Fast GPU Acceleration
To unlock Apple backups even faster, the tool engages the companyΓÇÖs patent-pending GPU acceleration technology. Elcomsoft Phone Password Breaker is the first GPU-accelerated iPhone/iPod password recovery tool on the market, and the only product to read and decrypt keychains (saved passwords to mail accounts, web sites and 3rd party applications) from password-protected backups (if password is known or recovered).
