When This Is The One was first published in 2007 it was hailed by Michael Crick as 'one of the all-time Manchester United classics' and featured by The Times in their quest to find the 'Best Ever 50 Sports Books'. Written over the course of two eventful and controversial seasons, This Is The One, offers a unique portrait of Sir Alex Ferguson, living legend, from Daniel TaylorΓÇÖs position behind the scenes as a football writer covering the club for The Guardian. 
Taylor sees Ferguson at one of the lowest ebbs of his quarter of a century in charge during the 2005-06 season, with a failing team, explosive fallouts with Roy Keane and Ruud van Nistelrooy, a disenchanted fan-base and speculation that he might be forced out of the job. 
The season that followed demonstrated why Ferguson is still the greatest manager in the game, deposing Chelsea as Premier League champions and eventually seeing off Jose Mourinho. Ferguson would later call it the 'greatest achievement' of his time at EnglandΓÇÖs biggest football club.
 This Is The One is the close-up, warts-and-all account of what happened during those two helterskelter seasons ΓÇô the excruciating lows and the exhilarating highs ΓÇô and the many different sides of Ferguson, from his infamous 'hairdryer' treatment to 
the softer, more humane side of the best and most successful manager in the entire history of football.
