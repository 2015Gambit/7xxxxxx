Note: 4500-4700 would've been perfect but some scenes needed high bitrate.. 
hence decided to go with 4800.. i tried 5000 which was a bit too much and 
4200 which failed the need of higher bitrate scenes Also this source is way
much better than the previous one! pls check the screens as the previous
source which EbP used was a bit zoomed in.
