BOYCOTT .rar TORRENTS!"
,pc-Gnome,2012-08-13T10:45Z,"christo7, I am with you 110%

But there's a root problem here. The organization that is in charge of ALL the encodes has mandated the use of RAR. They also mandate that NO compression be used in said RARs.

They are also the ones who mandate the stripping out of all uppercase letters in the filename.

It's their sand box and we're not invited.

That organization is ""Scene"" as in ""ob""."
,ShepardRahl,2012-08-16T02:14Z,I honestly do not understand what the big deal is if this is .rar. Big deal. Just unrar it. Not that hard. Unless you're just a troll for PublicHD. This is the exact same file that is in PublicHD's torrent. This one is just rared. I would appreciate it if somebody can actually explain to me what the big deal is aside from people just being too lazy to unrare files.

The argument is that not all people have unlimited disk space. Some prefer to download the torrent directly into their archive and then watch the file while it is being seeded.

Having RARed files means you have to unrar them and if you want to keep seeding it you still have to keep the RAR files as well which means it takes up twice as much disk space."
