,Expedio,2012-08-13T04:30Z,Is this one still fake? Or real??
,kayla514,2012-08-13T04:32Z,38 files? fake? i think so
,Expedio,2012-08-13T04:32Z,Fake or real?
,Expedio,2012-08-13T04:33Z,"the thing is i've downloaded plenty of other torrents from sceneline, and although i've read a few bad things about his uploads, the ones i personally have downloaded are all split into .rar files and have all been real, i'll give this one a shot i think"
,RinaLane,2012-08-13T04:34Z,I dont know why ppl cant just put simple video file without .rar
,teekie,2012-08-13T04:35Z,lol yes it is real and not a fake this you can tell because it doesn't have a singular .rar file. Plus sceneline is green and thus trusted in my book
,minasat,2012-08-13T04:36Z,Nah this legit cuz of the green skull. Download & extract thassall.
[T],theburningbush,2012-08-13T04:56Z,"Don't you guys have a clue about what the skulls signify?

And, contrary to many whiners and screamers, RAR files /= Fake !!!"
,mjavant,2012-08-13T04:58Z,It is a VIP uploader it can always be trusted.
,trixiedresden,2012-08-13T04:59Z,fuck you faker die in a hole
,saib0rg,2012-08-13T04:59Z,I'm pretty sure this one is good... It's a greenskull
,trixiedresden,2012-08-13T04:59Z,and it does have a rar file look3 up from the last
,5p1n47,2012-08-13T05:00Z,pretty sure its real but why risk when PubliHD is up at the same size
,5p1n47,2012-08-13T05:01Z,yes this is just the orig upload.....publicHD unrar'd and re-torrented
,MMusic123,2012-08-13T05:01Z,"ALWAYS wait for the ettv or tv team torrent to be sure it's real.  never grab a RAR of a show that just aired 1 hour ago...it's almost too soon to have it available, no?"
,TrollCon,2012-08-13T05:10Z,"The green skull means I give it a shot.  Also, sceneline has a good reputation.  If you are on the fence, the odds are in your favor."
,ap2882,2012-08-13T05:11Z,Why is there no user nuking option for this site?
,ap2882,2012-08-13T05:12Z,And the green skull is there because this guy's ratio is awesome. He uploads fakes to morons who think the green skull means that the torrent is legit. Idiots.
,jackfree,2012-08-13T05:41Z,"why can't you know it all bitches explains.. you just call the noobs stupid and never give the answers they're looking for.

what the fuck does the green skull mean, are we supposed to trust this one or not?"
,jackfree,2012-08-13T05:50Z,wtf
[V],sceneline,2012-08-13T06:00Z,"it's not fake it's .rar files download and enjoy
when i'm uploading you can't find from other uploaders they will upload hour after me,

who think it's fake don't download sample and who trust me download and Enjoy"
,eightyth_attempt2register,2012-08-13T06:04Z,sceneline I'm very curious.  Why do you have the files as rar instead of regular?
,SystemFolder,2012-08-13T10:17Z,"This torrent is real and definitely not fake. I should know; I downloaded and watched this after I watched it on live TV.

Note: A green skull means VIP which is a higher ""rank"" than trusted, or pink skull. You don't earn a green or pink skull just with a good ratio, it's a combination of things. You also can't buy or ask for a skull. When you earn one, you'll get it."
,SystemFolder,2012-08-13T10:21Z,"Also, if you think a torrent is fake, go to http://suprbay.org or click the forum link at the bottom of any TPB page, and report it in the proper thread."
