,slimtim91,2012-08-20T14:18Z,"do you have the Crack?
this is only a  ""base game"" 
i dont think there is eny no-cd crack with it..."
,Markopers,2012-08-22T12:39Z,Did you guys cracked the game?
,Markopers,2012-08-22T17:52Z,I open the game when i click on sunset valley (i started the game first time) then it goes by half and crashes!HELP!!!!!!!!!!!
,Cancrous,2012-08-22T23:56Z,"Calm down folks, this Torrent works fine, great even. Let me explain how to make it work:

1) First of all, extract from the ISO file to a new folder. You don't need an emulator or anything to get this torrent working so no need to mess with Daemon Tools or anything. Just forget about the ISO at this point.

2) Go into that file and hit the Sims3Setup button. When prompted, enter one of the provided CD codes provided in the CD-Key file. I used the top one and it worked fine.

3) Install the game and let it update, which will probably take awhile.

4) Now for the Crack: There IS NO crack in this torrent. The uploader was a bitch and wants you to go to his forum to get it there. Unfortunately his forum is all in Thai. Even worse, you need to register for the forum in order to get the crack. Go here to begin http://www.thaithesims3.com/topic.php?topic=33724&page=1&cmode=1#post512934 Use Google Chrome or a translating service of your preference to make the moon runes easier to decipher and begin the process, it's not hard. When prompted to fill out the Captcha (assuming you don't have a Thai keyboard lying around) go here http://typeinthai.com/ and type out the captcha then paste it into the forums captcha box. You'll get it eventually. Download the crack.

5) Install the crack in {:\Programs fileElectronic ArtThe Sims 3GameBin} Replace the old files when prompted.

This is what I did and it worked fine for me and has been for a few days now. Also, learn to read people... he even includes instructions in there."
