This month's Simpsons showcase offers a snout full of savory stories. First, Homer opts into Mr. Burns' 'golden parachute' program and soon finds himself and his family living a life that's less than luxurious on Mr. Burns' tropical island retirement community, which is made entirely of trash. Then, Bart pits himself against Marge in a battle of wills; specifically, will Bart take a bath or not? Finally, Bartman is up to his elbows in ectoplasm when he gets a helping hand from the hapless ghost of good ol' salesman Gil. It's gooey goodness and ghastly gladness that will make you gag galore! 

Thanks goes to Harkonnen for this release.
