I am currently digitizing all my Zymurgys along with BYO (Brew Your Own) magazines.

I am looking to find the missing issues and will post what magazines I am missing if anyone wants to share them to have them digitized. I will be happy to return after digitizing them. Email me at  beermags (AT) gmail dot com  if you think you can.
