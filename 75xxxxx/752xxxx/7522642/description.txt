Lionel Leo Hampton (April 20, 1908 ΓÇô August 31, 2002) was an American jazz vibraphonist, pianist, percussionist, bandleader and actor. Like Red Norvo, he was one of the first jazz vibraphone players. Hampton ranks among the great names in jazz history, having worked with a who's who of jazz musicians, from Benny Goodman and Buddy Rich to Charlie Parker and Quincy Jones. In 1992, he was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.

The late Lionel Hampton was the premier vibes player and one of the most popular orchestra leaders of the late Swing Era. MOSTLY BLUES is from late in Hamp's career--he was in his 80s, but one would never know it from this session. Backed by an ace small group (including legends Bobby Scott and Grady Tate), Hampton's vibes still sparkle, though it also sounds as if he'd been absorbing Milt Jackson's blues-inflected style. MOSTLY BLUES is a solid set of bluesy, old-school funky (think Horace Silver) jazz.
