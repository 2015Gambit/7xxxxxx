Before installing this bird, close all programms that uses the internet! Or simply, install this shit offline!

How to install:

1. Instal QualityWings Boeing 757. (Serial: QW757-6CJ6-WHKR-E1D1-LPNL-WQS9)
2. Instal the two service packs found on the official website of Qualitywings. (www.qwsim.com).
3. Instal the reg. file.
4. Start FSX, here is the tricky part. Run the gauges, then it will ask if you want to run 'Add-on manager'. DON'T RUN ADD-ON MANAGER! 
(You can aslo get a error message that says the serial is black listed, ignore it and continue).
5. Enjoy!

You can install liveries from the QualityWings webiste under 'Downloads'. when downloaded a livery just run the Livery manager and select the paint.

A MILLION THANKS TO WHOEVER UPLOADED THIS AIRCRAFT UNTO THIS SITE FIRST,I ONLY PLAYED AROUND WITH IT AND MADE SURE IT WASN'T CRASHING TO DESKTOP (CTD) WHEN BEING INVOKED IN FSX.NOW IT IS AS COOL AS IT CAN BE.
P.S:THE INITIAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS REMAIN AS IS.( A COPY OF THE SERVICE PACK TWO EXECUTABLE FILE IS ENCLOSED IN THE FOLDER,SHOULD THE SP1 EXECUTABLE FAIL TO GIVE THE DESIRED RESULTS.
