Debate over the pro-Obama superPAC "Joe Soptic" ad hits fever pitch 89 days before the election. Mitt Romney is crying foul in a stunning display of hypocrisy.
Tonight, Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View Columnist), and Michael Kinsley (Bloomberg View columnist), join Ed for that.

Newt Gingrich admits Romney's welfare commercial is full of holes. Chris Kofinis (Democratic Strategist) agrees, and he'll join us to set Mitt straight.

Republicans aren't even trying to hide their voter suppression efforts in Ohio. We'll show you how they're rigging the vote ahead of the November election with Sen. Nina Turner (D-OH) and Ari Berman (Contributing Writer for The Nation and Rolling Stone).

Romney thinks corporations are people.  But when it comes to releasing his tax returns, Mitt says he's "not a business." The Big Panel John Hlinko (Democratic Strategist), Michelle Goldberg (Senior contributing writer, Newsweek & The Daily Beast NY), Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View Columnist) weighs in on the "Romney reverse."

And the Romney camp is out with another lie: that President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion.
