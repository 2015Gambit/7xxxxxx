Boyling 2004 Grieve's Modern Manual Therapy The Vertebral Column 3rd

Since the second edition of this book was published the world has changed. Only future generations will be able to judge whether it was in general for the better or for the worse. However, in the world of manual therapy the changes that have taken place have been for the better.

This third edition comes some 9 years after the second and 17 years after the first. Some readers may consider the gaps between the three editions to be long but in reality change does not take place overnight. The pauses reflect the time taken for further maturity to occur within the field of manual therapy. Research that was being considered at the time of the second edition has now been undertaken and the results considered. Readers of this new edition will be able to benefit from that research. At the same time, however, previous editions are not obsolete but remain a valuable reference tool and, with the passage of time, will provide a useful barometer of how the focus of the profession has changed and matured.
