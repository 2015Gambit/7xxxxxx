To the casual listener these may sound quaint and dated......something grandma and 

grandpa might have dug into.

For the Ellington fan.....these could be as good as it gets.  Ellington

transcriptions from the swing era.....THE "BLANTON/WEBSTER" BAND.......

Jimmy Blanton is widely credited with changing the role of the "Bass Violin" in jazz 

music.  


My favorites are tracks #2,4,7,8,13,14,19,23,24,25


Herb Jeffries is the male vocalist on several tracks.....If Nat Cole had put on an  

extra 50 kilos he would have sounded like Herb Jeffries who later found acting roles 

as the "Bronze Buckaroo."
