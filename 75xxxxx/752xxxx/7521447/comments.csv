,Magic_friendly,2012-08-11T06:24Z,"Hey man, I cannot change the ali213.ini file settings. It will not let me, anyway you can copy it and change it to english, and upload it? I know it just came out and nobody has stated they have problems with it, but I cannot change it for some reason. It says access is denied."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-11T06:29Z,"Nvm, got the language fixed and changed to English! For anyone who does have problems, copy the ALI213.ini file to your desktop, change it, then drag it back into the folder the game is in and overwrite it. Seeing how the file was in Program Files, it would not let me change it. Weird... Thanks though man!"
,asdfkjjj,2012-08-11T14:04Z,"Unlike Rigonauts, this game runs, but it asks you to create an account with robot games. Not cracked."
,m4dm4nLT,2012-08-11T14:49Z,@asdfkjj you can play online with this. You just get the only free council team.
,isilox,2012-08-11T21:59Z,"There doesn't seem to be any single-player mode, except challange mode, in which you have just single turn to kill the stationary enemy..."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-12T03:52Z,"Both of you are right. It is only online, whether it's private games OR against random people, BUT it's not cracked. If this was cracked, you would NOT have just 1 team to use. You would be able to play as the Team Fortress 2 team as well. So far, he has cracked only just a few games. Others do not work so well. This still feels like a demo. Not to mention, it's a cross-platformer, so you might play people on ios or iPhones if it's available for that, can't remember. I just hate it when people do not finish their game and let it sit, and go do something else. This isn't fucking Facebook. Finish your game!"
