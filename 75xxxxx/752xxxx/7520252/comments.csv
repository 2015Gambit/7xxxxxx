,LeGrinde,2012-08-10T20:06Z,"THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!
I don't usually go through the trouble of logging in just so I can leave a comment, but, especially with Demonoid gone, I am so glad someone here is still uploading Project Runway!"
,slingshottt,2012-08-10T20:50Z,"No seriously, I could never repay you in a million years.  I'm American and just cause I live overseas means I can't watch an American show, that's insane.  Any one should be able to watch anything anywhere no matter what anyway....

Thanks so much for taking the time to upload this.  I'll seed as much as I can..."

[T],rkstr,2012-08-17T10:56Z,I'm so over @GhettoDiva types with their complaints about the quality.How about I not upload it at all? How does that quality suit you?

Yes TvTeam has uploaded E05 today but it breaks my heart to see trolls ruin an amazin flow and demoralise you rkstr. Ignore it. Do your thing consistently. We appeci8 your work.  "
