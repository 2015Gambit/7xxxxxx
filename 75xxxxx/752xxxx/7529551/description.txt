Playback allows you to share your media with any Playstation 3, Xbox 360, or other UPnP compatible device. It automatically integrates with iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture, Photobooth, Adobe Lightroom 2 and more. You can share all content from these applications or choose specific playlists and albums.
Playback can also share media stored in folders or even make entire disks available to your Playstation 3 or Xbox 360. By default, Playback will share almost any content on your system. No configuration required!

It is also not recommended to update since I tried it and it asks you for a serial. Just keep using this version until another cracked one arises. works perfectly with my ps3.
