                 if you are using UTORRENT.
download the file,and as it is downloading pause it. Then in utorrent window click on files at bottom middle of screen. you will see all in the D/L FILE. highlight the D/L IN MAIN WINDOW
RIGHT CLICK ON WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT
THEN ON DO NOT D/L THIS. It will take a liitle bit
to get what you want but this is how i do it.
Some one may have better way of doing it.

                                good luck
