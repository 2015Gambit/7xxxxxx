Haliparot_2012(DVDRip)(PINOY INDIE FILM)



"Haliparot (Mana Sa Ina)" explores the lives of sisters Karen and Leslie (Lucia Legarda and Anya Soler) who grew up from a troublesome past. Their mother was caught sleeping with her paramour (her erstwhile first love, and possibly the father of one of the girls). At the constant prodding of a concerned kumpare (an old police man), their father (Lucas Leonardo) finds them canoodling, eventually resulting to a blood bath that killed all the three involved.

The siblings grow up pretty, but the younger Karen seems to have acquired the playful dalliances of her coquettish mother - thus its title "Haliparot", ending up on the matrimonial beds of married men and inspiring heart attacks from young concupiscent men (Jeremy Ian). As a consequence, the town turns against Karen, who finds a shoulder to cry on in a parish priest, Father Martin (Daniel Fernando). One day, Leslie catches his beau Raymond (Miguel Ramirez) and sister Karen in flagrante delicto, forcing the latter to run away. But luck seems to be on Karen's side when a geriatric millionaire (out of the goodness of his heart, of course) offers her shelter - and ultimately, marriage!
