 Two close and devout Muslim youth, Javed     
 and Akhtar, are childhood pals. They both    
 unknowingly fall in love with the same woman,
 Firdaus. Since Akhtar is wealthy, and comes  
 from a noble family, the girl's dad, Nawab   
 Mirza, decides that she should marry Akhtar. 
 She is reluctant to do so, but finally agrees
 when she is threatened. Akhtar has not yet   
 seen Firdaus, but finds out that Javed also  
 loves her, and he decides to marry her, and  
 promptly divorce her by saying "Talaq" three 
 times, so that Javed can marry her later.    
 Javed is delighted with this idea and goes   
 along with it, not knowing that Firdaus is   
 Akhtar's dreamgirl, and he may not be able   
 to keep his word and divorce her.
