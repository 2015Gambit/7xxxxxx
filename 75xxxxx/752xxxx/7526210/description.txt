MisterMusic Show   episode 214 [192 kbps MP3] -2 hours

.

A little something for everyone this week, new music by Dead Can Dance, Paul Banks from Interpol, The Fixx, Bob Mould and another new track from Yeasayer.  
Plus the 'Oldie of the Week' holds the distinction of being a tune that went to number 1 twice- but sixteen years apart.
And even a couple classic rock hits thrown into the mix as well this week.

The MisterMusic Show- broadcast weekly and heard all over the globe on Rock XS Radio.


-Thanks for tuning in
