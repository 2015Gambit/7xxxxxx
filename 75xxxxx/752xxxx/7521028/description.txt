READ ME (2)

(Have you read : README1.pdf ??) 
==> About this Torrent : 
_ There are mutiple language translations provided. The languages for which there are 
more than 1 translation are : English (9) , German (2) , Spanish (2) , Urdu (2).

_ 1. Install Quran Viewer v 2.9 by clicking : QViewer 2.9.exe.
_ 2. Install the Quran translation you are interested in by clicking the corresponding *.dbt
file OR by going to Languages>Translations Manager. Restart Quran Viewer after 
installing a translation module or a desired font (*.ttf).

_ A useful feature is the view feature where you can arrange for the software to display 
multiple translations at the same time (Languages>Views Manager) (don't forget to restart 
Qur'an Viewer).

_ After experimenting with the software for a while, I am sure you will manage to 
understand all the useful features.

_ The folders whose name are starting by "_" are just extra stuff for those who might be 
interested.


==> Acknowledgement : 
_ May Allah (swt) reward generously JAMAL AL-NASIR who undoubtedly spent many hours of code writing/debugging to provide Muslims - as well as Non-Muslims - with this very nice-looking and stable Multilingual Quran-Viewer freeware. 
_ As I understand, Multilingual Qur'an Viewer is no longer being supported or developed since JAMAL AL-NASIR had to step down for personal reasons....So, cyber-dwellers : get it while you can !. 

==> Final Words : 
_ If you are approaching the Qur'an for the first time, I would advise you to start reading it starting from the end (like I did), a few pages at a time. 
_ "Good Luck".
