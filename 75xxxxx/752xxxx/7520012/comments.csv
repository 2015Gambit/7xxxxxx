,gerdsperd,2012-08-10T10:34Z,"Thank you for this.  However, it is not a small file.  If you make the torrent from your relevant directory structure, people will be able to pick what they want to download."
,johnmilken,2012-08-10T10:53Z,"I have a fast connection, so maybe only small at this end."
,johnmilken,2012-08-10T10:54Z,"OK - will get around to that at some point in the near future, or feel free to that yourself. This was zipped for personal back up, and thought I'd share it here at the same time"
[T],V413HAV,2012-08-10T11:25Z,"@john next time when you upload, upload it without compressing, or else atleast add a text file with a list of book names ;) happy uploading
"
,johnmilken,2012-08-10T13:36Z,Sorry all - only my 2nd torrent. The next one will be better
,johnmilken,2012-08-10T14:08Z,"A new torrent will be posted within the hour, with individual files and a CSV library file. I will also post the link here - so wait if you'd prefer this"
,johnmilken,2012-08-10T14:34Z,OK - new torrent is failing to upload. Will try again tomorrow and post link here also
,emails667,2012-08-11T05:46Z,Virus !!!
,burt007,2012-08-11T08:39Z,@emails thanks for the warning. 
,johnmilken,2012-08-11T08:56Z,"Damn - can't submit a new torrent, and sorry about the virus warning, although the file has been scanned with AVG and seems all clear at this end

Much apologies, and hopefully this torrent will die [if I can't work out how to remove it]"
