,DumStick,2012-08-13T10:58Z,"Same here, brush up your video skillz !!

720p ought to have an resolution of 1280x720 not 1280x5xx !!!

All you folks release so called ""HD"" releases that infact are not standards compliant !!!

Either the resolution is very wrong or the framerate is screwed all resulting in bad PLAYBACK garanteed !!!

,sconlan,2012-08-13T11:41Z,"@DumStick I notice you don't have any uploads? Maybe when you walk the walk you can talk the talk? YIFY uploads are always the best, considering sizes. Thanks again YIFY."

,babyryanimay,2012-08-13T22:14Z,the comment is for jeepers creepers hehehehe
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-13T23:33Z,"Great as always from YIFY. Thank you!

Some of you may want to wait for DumsStick's ultra 2160p Ultra-HD megarelease of this film, since he/she is the self-proclaimed master of high quality video uploads. :)"
,sweet1969,2012-08-14T02:08Z,ALMOST ALL OF YOUR MOVIE DESCRIPTIONS FROM THE LAST FEW DAYS ARE ABOUT 'JEEPERS CREEPERS'!! WHY?!!?!?
,DumStick,2012-08-14T13:49Z,"@scolan

WATCH ME AND READ MY LIPS...

I walk the WALK & talk the TALK ..

Anyone who is uploading how much is BESIDE THE POINT here !!

The point is , stick to the HD standard compliant settings when converting anything and everything will turn out just fine!!

Rest asure , failing to do so WILL BACK fire in your face sooner or later if you try to play it in stand alones for example !!

Hence my plea ""if you gotta do it, THEN Do It RIGHT ..!!"
,DumStick,2012-08-14T14:20Z,"@scolan,

,ganorax,2012-08-17T09:04Z,"@Dumstick, please keep in mind that 720p is stand for 1280x720 resolution, this is for 16:9 ratio (1.77:1) in common screen TV, while the most used aspect ratio in movie theaters are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, much wider like this one.
Despite the vertical resolution, if it has 1280 pixel horizontal resolution then it IS 720p, to maintain the aspect ratio.
Let's say if we are to keep the 720 pixel vertical as you expected, so the horizontal resolution will go beyond 1280 pixel which is very much useless as the TV will ""shrink"" the movie to 1280 pixel to fit the TV screen, so does with the vertical resolution.
Believe that if YIFY is to rip the 16:9 movie, it will have 720 pixel vertical resolution, so please stop being the smartest dude.
Anyway, thanks YIFY for the great job."

A/V: 9/8

Oh and proper Summary for anyone who cares, from videosoon.com

U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault (Efron) returns from his third tour of duty in Iraq, with the one thing he credits with keeping him alive-a photograph he found of a woman he doesn't even know. Learning her name is Beth (Schilling) and where she lives, he shows up at her door, and ends up taking a job at her family-run local kennel. Despite her initial mistrust and the complications in her life, a romance develops between them, giving Logan hope that Beth could be much more than his good luck charm."
