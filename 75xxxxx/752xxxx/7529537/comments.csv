,OmniNegro,2012-08-13T22:35Z,"No. This is the only torrent on a new account. It is an executable, so it infects you when you try to unpack it. And there is no point since real groups have done proper cracks. 

This is fake shit."
,gamerszonero,2012-08-13T23:56Z,"The installer unpacks 2 dlls, a readme and some screenshots. It has no viruses."
,OmniNegro,2012-08-14T03:24Z,"Put it in a zip or rar without a password and we may believe you. As it is, it looks just like every other malware infected trap placed here by scammers.

If I am mistaken, then I apologize. But that is how I see it. Good day to you."
