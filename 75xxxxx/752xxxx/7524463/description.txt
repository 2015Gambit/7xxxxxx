BEAUTIFUL DARLING chronicles the short but influential life of Candy Darling, who was a major part of Andy Warhol's entourage and was one of the inspirations for the Lou Reed song "Walk on the Wild Side." The film uses both current and vintage interviews, excerpts from Candy's own diaries and letters, as well as vintage footage of Candy and friends. ChloÃ« Sevigny appears as the voice of Candy Darling, and interview subjects include John Waters, Fran Lebowitz, Holly Woodlawn, Julie Newmar, Bob Colacello, Paul Morrissey and Michael J. Pollard. Rex Reed, of the New York Observer, describes the film as "an extraordinarily sad, touching and compassionate documentary." Stephen Farber, of the Hollywood Reporter, calls it "incisive... expertly recreates a slice of the cultural history of the '60s while also telling us something about the poisonous addiction of fame."
