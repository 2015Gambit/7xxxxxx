Roadmarks
Roger Zelazny
1979

This guy had an advanced version of the iPad all the way back in 1979.

The Road runs from the unimaginable past to the far future, and those who travel it have access to the turnoffs leading to all times and places--even to the alternate time-streams of histories that never happened. Why the Dragons of Bel'kwinith made the Road--or who they are--no one knows. But the Road has always been there and for those who know how to find it, it always will be!

This is one of my favorites. If you can find the book buy it.
