Sorry about doing all these updates but I want this discography in the best possible state because that's exactly what I would want from anyone else. This band really means a lot to me, too.

I've given up on the 2005-2006 DVD, though. The person I talked to is just outright ignoring me now, leading me to believe she never had it in the first place. Super disappointed about it."
