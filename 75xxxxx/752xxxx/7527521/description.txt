Same as the old one, pretty much. Redid Hatsutaiken (should play flawlessly now), added Mariko's solo album and its limited edition DVD, and added alternate covers for certain albums and such.

There might be one more update in the future, we'll see. Still haven't gotten anything back about the missing DVD, and it's been months since I last got a message, so don't hold your breath.
