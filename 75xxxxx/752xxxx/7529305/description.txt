We are holding Aikido classes on Saturday, from 10am to noon, at our Karate dojo / school in Lake City, SC. These classes focus primarily on teaching this traditional martial art and its principles of peaceful, natural movement and self defense. We are also holding Fitness classes at our school on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
