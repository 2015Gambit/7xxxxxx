,DarkJuggalo,2012-08-12T21:50Z,MCL Homie thanks
,Juggalo_Riddle,2012-08-13T03:29Z,You're welcome :) Make sure you bookmark my page for future releases! 
,Dreamwire,2012-08-14T07:49Z,May I respectfully ask where you ripped these from? Is it from a real CD or Itunes? It's just that I like to download things ripped from a retail versions and not some promo crap. Thanks in advance:)
,DanielTurtleface,2012-08-14T14:41Z,I made an account just to say thanks! Whoop whoop! I'm not getting paid until friday and wanted this. I'm only going to be buying the black pop though
,Ulfbein,2012-08-14T23:53Z,Thanks for uploadin this ninja MMFWCL
,Juggalo_Riddle,2012-08-15T02:52Z,"@DreamWire - I own the box set. 

@ Everyone else - Thank you for showing some love to this torrent. I'll seed as long as I can, and then it will be up to you all to keep it going. 

Long live the clowns! lol Whoop Whoop! I'm glad you all appreciate my efforts! Much love to all of you!"
,Dreamwire,2012-08-15T07:46Z,"Thanks for your reply:) I've already downloaded it, just wanted to make sure. I'll seed as long as I can. Thank you for this torrent, it's of a very high quality:)"
,monacelli,2012-08-19T18:58Z,"@Juggalo_Riddle There is no ""box set"" of Mighty Death Pop yet so the fact that you're lying about that makes your release suspect.  Is Red Pop a reencode of the wma's that were floating around?"
,Juggalo_Riddle,2012-08-20T12:10Z,"@monacelli - There never was a box set sold (yet). But if there were. It'd be the same fucking thing. The Red Version here, is MP3 format. Fuck off. This shit is the real fucking deal, I was the first to get my hands on every damn cd and upload them at this quality. I've added every detail to every track, I've organized this far better than an ICP torrent released. Who are you to come step on my toes about there not being an ""official"" box set. I own every damn cd for the Mighty Death Pop and I've made it availible to all of you for what? FREE - The effort put into this, trumps your message of technicality. Get off my torrent page, and troll somewhere else. Ungrateful prick. Mad love to those that show appreciation, and fuck the fuck off if you got anything else to say."

,juggalo69420,2012-08-21T01:13Z,"Thanks Riddle, been looking forward to a COMPLETE set, can't wait to d/l and listen to it. MMFWCL! WHOOP!! WHOOP!!"
,Juggalo_Riddle,2012-08-21T16:50Z,"@Juggalotus420 - What a surprise! One of the individuals that inspired me to start releasing my own torrents snatches and comments on one of my newest, and probably greatest release! An honor I feel it is! lol Thanks homie! I'll whoop to that. :) 

@Everyone else, your appreciation stands out. :) Thank you & you're welcome!!"
,monacelli,2012-08-24T21:39Z,"@Juggalo_Riddle I asked what method you used to rip the albums because juggalos are known for shitty rips.  In the time it took you to curse me out in your comment, you could've ripped the albums using EAC + Lame (v0).  Providing logs leaves no doubt about the quality of your rip and shuts haters like me up."
,DanielTurtleface,2012-08-27T00:45Z,Why the fuuuuuuuuuuck is there -1??
