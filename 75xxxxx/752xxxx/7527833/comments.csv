Add .mp4 to the end of the filename. For some reason this upload wasn't given a file type, at least for my download of it."

,libertaswv,2012-08-27T00:58Z,"One of only a handful of shows, fic or allegedly nonfic, that actually manages to prtray the dynamics at work in American 'news' accurately. 

The grossness of the editorial stance/news divisions of ALL American television news is the direct result of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It ended bans on regional media monopolies, and threw open the door for the centralization/corporate takeover of (essentially) all American mass media. Republican Bill signed by a Dem Pres. By the rich, for the rich. THAT is 'what happened' to the intelligence level of Americans. We weren't terribly well informed before 1996, but we've gotten much, much worse - and it only took about 5 years for it to happen. It's pathetic, frightening, and dangerous... Shows like this are one of the few hopes we have of alerting the 'information poor' what has happened (though most of them are probably watching 'Real Housewives of Moron Ave, or something).

Watch/listen DemocracyNOW if you want anything resembling an informed, accurate accounting of the day's news. 

Thx for the up, and to all s/l's... Will seed
