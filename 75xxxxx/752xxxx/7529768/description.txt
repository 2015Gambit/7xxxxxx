Dr. Chaudhary must perform multiple surgeries  
on Major Ranjeet Khanna, who was shot by the   
Police while trying to escape from custody     
after killing his wife, Pushpa, and her lover, 
Prakash. Chances of Ranjeet's recovery are very
slim, if he does recover, he could end up      
mentally unstable or paralyzed. In the event   
he does recover, the medical staff's efforts   
would be in vain as he has already been        
found guilty and sentenced to be hanged.
