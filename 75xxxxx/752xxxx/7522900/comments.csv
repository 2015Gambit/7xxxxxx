[V],twentyforty,2012-08-11T13:12Z,"I seed 24/7 ALL recent uploads. On ""To Kill..."" you have dozen seeders. Do NOT shout ""Wolf!"" if there is none."
,ani12,2012-08-11T13:42Z,"i dint mean to... just tat i hav been trying to download it frm nearly two days.. n thr aren't a dozen on it.. found some 3-4, tats all... man i respect u, dint mean to offend u.."
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-11T14:42Z,"Nope. I tried, even again few moments ago and within 3 seconds speed hit - more fast then you can ever go!

You have line problems, ani. Everything is fine with my seeding - and I said just that, nothing more than a push to look closely in your problem. It looks like you block my own server (with PeerBlock perhaps, blocks my SIS OVH). "
