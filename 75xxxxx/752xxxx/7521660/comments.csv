,ncrosanct,2012-08-12T07:49Z,Is this running on initial seeding or not? I mainly ask as it just seems like the majority of people are stuck around 20% for pretty much most of the day.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-13T04:36Z,"Stupid question, I'm sure; this is the remastered version, right? "
,shane3900,2012-08-13T17:48Z,"i've got 42.3 per cent and coming in at less than 1k/bs if at all. never hooks up to seeders. please seeders upload it like crazy there are a lot of trekkers out there, that want this."
,kensuke77,2012-08-14T04:39Z,Does this include any of the bonus stuff?
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-15T19:32Z,"Yeah, uhhh, super grateful and all. I don't normally say anything negative in regards to getting something for free. But, uhhh, what's going on with this?

Never connects to seed.

Downloads at less than 1kbps.

At this rate there will never be any other seeders because we can't download the thing."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-15T19:35Z,No bonus stuff. Just the individual episodes.
,joe180,2012-08-15T22:54Z,How does the quality compare to the bigger 720p rips?
,ncrosanct,2012-08-15T23:47Z,"It is up to 170 seeders, that actually never seed somehow, and currently stuck at 60% with 0.627 availability. I was hoping to finish this soon as I have a trip I am going on and wanted to have this to pass some time while away. The infinity ETA doesn't help that cause."
,shane3900,2012-08-16T00:32Z,think i may delete this and wait 1 more month and just buy it. stuck at 60 percent
,RX_Games,2012-08-16T02:03Z,"Give it some time.

I'm growing impatient too, but remember, it's only been uploaded four days ago. Not to mention, it's a 22GB file download.

Download else to pass the time. Maybe get another version of the Blu-Ray rip of TNG or TOS or whatever.

But you're right, this is getting on my nerves."
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-17T08:00Z,"I have a fiber optic connection and would LOVE to share this with my fellow pirates....

With only ONE SEED, that ain't gonna happen."
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-17T22:07Z,Seed or DIE you maggots!
,RX_Games,2012-08-18T01:49Z,"shane, you're going to give up that easily? Well, maybe you can buy the BluRay and upload it. :)"
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-18T03:32Z,"I am uploading at 2Mbps, and only getting 3Kbps download.

PLEASE SEED!!!"
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-18T05:28Z,"Stuck at 98.6%.  :(

MORE POWER TO THE WARP ENGINES!!!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-18T08:14Z,"A'ight peoples. I'm at 99.7% and there's more than twenty of us between 99.6 and 99.8%. Sometime in the next couple hours I should be 100%, based on what I've seen over the last couple.

 I'm heading off to slumberland right now, but before doing so I'm going to set my upload to unlimited and I'll leave it there all weekend. Hopefully that will help get the seeding on this thing rolling. "
,kaiz3rsoze,2012-08-18T09:31Z,Audio is out of sync for the first episode. The other episodes seem fine though.
,Willravel,2012-08-18T20:32Z,This doesn't appear to be full 1080p quality. It looks like 720p brought up to 1080p size. Perhaps someone with more expertise can verify. 
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-18T22:12Z,"It IS 1080p, Willravel.  It is presented in it's original 4:3 aspect ratio."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-19T05:50Z,"I gotta say, these look pretty damn good.

Yes, I'm sure they look better on the factory pressed blu-ray, but that ain't what we're watching here.

I've watched an episode all the way through on my PC using the VLC player, burned raw files to a DVD and watched them on a standard and 50"" HDTV, and burned the first seven episodes to a DVD with a menu using ConvertXtoDVD 4. 

In ALL cases they look FAR better than they did on TV originally, on the original VHS releases and on the original DVD releases. In fact, I'm quite blown away by the quality and clarity. As many other people have mentioned in other places, it's like watching an entirely new show. I'm seeing details, colors and depth that I never new was there, and I've watched this show obsessively since it begin airing. Sometimes what you are seeing is so clear and detailed that it actually makes it look more fake. Nothing to be done about that, though. I'm sure this is how it looked on set while they were filming.

I'd like to say that the improved special effects are outstanding and impressive, etc., but I'm so amazed and engrossed by looking at everything on the screen that I'm barely noticing them. I can't recommend highly enough downloading this, or better yet, buying it, which I'll be doing very shortly."
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-19T23:51Z,"This will definitely tide me over until I can buy the retail set.  I have already created an AVCHD and a Blu-ray to get the full quality of these files, and am very impressed.

While this was slow as hell at first, a good swarm has now built and it should come in fast for those just joining.

Thanks, afkuser2!"
,wthrman,2012-08-21T20:25Z,Yes! My download speed just jumped to 400-500 kB/s after downloading at only about 25 kB/s for around 2.5 hours. Keep seeding guys!!
,piratebay_4ever,2012-08-26T13:39Z,"First, let me thank the uploader for this wonderful upload. Thank you very much!!

I have a question. Does anyone know how I can view the torrent contents of the downloaded torrent?

Usually the contents are visible where they can be picked selectively, but not so here. Is there an option where I can change that?

Thank you for your reply."
,MC_Hammer_Pant,2012-08-29T22:55Z,I already own all the original DVD releases from back in the day and just couldn't bring myself to spend money all over again for the remastersâŚ so I am extremely thankful for this.  My wife too! lmao
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-09-06T08:57Z,"afkuser2, can you re-up the first episode, ""Encounter at Farpoint"" with the audio sync fixed?  And, could you provide a link to it for us?"
,Cookiefist,2012-09-08T16:48Z,"The audio anomaly is not the uploaders fault.  The legit bluray originals were released with this flaw.  They are shipping out replacements free of charge cuz of it...

,Quantico7,2012-09-16T09:09Z,"OK first thanks for this awesome upload!

I am looking forward to the second season release whenever that may be.

I have just started downloading, and will seed for 2 weeks uncapped after completion on a 120mbit fibre link.

Thanks to somms for the original rip, and to afkuser2 for the split!!"
,jessyang,2012-09-17T08:54Z,Thanks so much! Everything's great. Any chance of having the special features up too?
