[V],psspss,2012-08-13T12:51Z,"sadly was many leechers and had to reboot pcs a few times.. as fixing bloody win 7 again
so took much longer to seed out then normal

but i see it has a good 15 sharers now"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T13:01Z,tpb stats must still be off cuz it sez 17 seeders here but utorrent tells me thiers over 50.you should be able to drop it safely if you haven't already
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T13:14Z,"yep I drop once 15 is hit

im not sure if its really 50.. seems many fakers antip2pers get on sharing fake data to slow it down
and p1ss people off

im way over data cap.. so I have to drop as soon as can

it resets in 7 days still :) then another 120gb

I need someone whos got much data for usenet
and grab the 100gb of ts.mpeg rips of the
meteorite men there as no one has done it
however only avidemux 2.6beta is only one will
convert them properly to xvid.. and have to install
deinterface filter to fix them as well.. if its like others ive done

if not i might be able to do a couple a month and convert to xvids"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T13:35Z,"your using peerblock 1.1 ? you should if not
it block them from showing up and sharing the bad chunks .. wont hide ip.. its not for that
I use it with vpns as well then one is covered"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T14:15Z,"to be honest I'm not sure what I've got going on.my friend set it all up for me like 2years ago & then updates it for me every 3-6 months.he said I would never have a problem with anything & so far hes rite.no letters from my isp about downloading,no viruses ever & no spy/mal at all.my network is like a vault.hes one of those guys you could give an empty soda can & some string to and he'll build you a new tv with a bluray player.realy smart kid that one"

Seems theres some video corruption at 31:56 in and a few seconds of footage is lost
but it stays in sync

the source I used came from another source but they used evolve first attempt by looks

im not too worried about it myself

someone has upped a 349 new xvid so if worries you get that one "
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T14:20Z,"the bit lost wasnt that great of a loss anyhow
but for the purest

sorry bit late checking out stuff today as only watching it now myself.."
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T14:23Z,"
usless you have purchases a vpn outside usa reach you could get letters.

normally nbc are the main senders lately like
they own part of syfy chan and people got letters for eureka and other syfy shares I heard (just before all the DDOS attacks and hacking of torrent sites)"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T14:36Z,"I'm in the USA & like I said I never hear from my isp...until its time to pay the bill that is ;) I know ppl that  have gotten letters,but then again their best friend isn't a super geek with Rainman-like tech skills"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T14:41Z,"vpns cost money so you know if on one.. just
an extra cost above the data costs of isps
per month.. although some are like $5 a month
"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T14:43Z,"31:15 I mean.. and it lot 17 seconds by looks
must of been the end of the scene in the tent
and walking out LOL

no biggy for me "
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T17:48Z,"the thing is we don't have ""data costs"" here,we just have internet.for all I know a vpn could be part of what Comcast gives me for $50 a month ($80 in all cuz its an extra $30 for phone service)Charter is another big one in the US & most of the ppl I know that have got letters have Charter internet.all I know for sure is after about 2years on TPB & Demonoid I've not had a single problem"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T18:09Z,"no a vpn is a server in another country that runs encrypted links so you can have a ip of where the server is run

google vpn or read about it on torrentfreak

btguard is a vpn of sorts"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T18:29Z,"ok,kinda like a decoy of sorts.unless JK set it up & pays for it without me knowing than I don't have one.althou,thats the kinda guy he is so I'll have to ask him about it"
