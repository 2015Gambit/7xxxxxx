,Spc.,2012-08-13T15:51Z,minhthai911 can you upload just original audio at 192kbit/s stereo without commentary please ?
,bayflies,2012-08-14T15:18Z,"For me, the audio does not play in VLC or Quicktime player, and the video stops and starts all over the place. There is definitely something wrong with this file."
,bayflies,2012-08-14T15:19Z,"Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the file size is actually 2.02Gig, and not the 1.89Gig as stated in the torrent description."
,JDWtr707,2012-08-19T14:59Z,Thanks for the upload!  Your uploads of the ceremonies are the only one I've found without commentary.  The idiots that needlessly talk during the ceremony ruins the performance.  I hope you upload future Olympics too!  Thank you!
