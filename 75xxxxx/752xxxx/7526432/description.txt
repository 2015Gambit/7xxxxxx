The Hep Stars was a Swedish rock group, formed in 1963 in Stockholm. During
1965-1966 the band was the most successful of contemporary 1960s Swedish pop
groups performing in English language. Outside the Nordic countries the band is
best known as a launching point for keyboard player and composer Benny
Andersson, who went on to enjoy worldwide success with ABBA.
 
The band was founded by drummer Christer "Chrille" Pettersson (d.2006) and bass
guitarist Lennart "Lelle" Hegland in 1963 with keyboardist Hans Östlund and
guitarist-singer Jan "Janne" Frisk joining. At their height of popularity the
line-up consisted of Hegland, Pettersson, Frisk and Sven "Svenne" Hedlund on
lead vocals and Benny Andersson on keyboards.
