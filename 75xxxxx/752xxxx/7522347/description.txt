QC 52 - The Periodic Elements

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The 3D models of ALL the elemental nuclei possible are presented.

Displaying their exploded (aufbau) nuceli, 3D quantum charge geometries, quantum numbers, energy levels, elemental properties, electron configurations, spectral lines, specific masses and intrinsic kinetic energies; this chapter provides an unheralded view of elemental atomic nuclei.

The fifty-second chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
