Here is the Live in the LBC concert audio ripped at 320@.

The whole concert is included minus the first 50 intro seconds of cheering and end credit songs.

Every song and interlude between songs is separated seamlessly for a total of 24 tracks. This is to make finding your favorite part easy, while still allowing for the whole concert to be played together smooth.

Cover art is included.
