QC 53 - Elemental Families

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The elemental family geometries of all periodic elements are revealed, explaining the source of their similar properties.

The new Tetryonic model of Periodic elements provides a clear visual representation of the elemental families

The fifty-third chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
