                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary telling the story of Terry Thompson, who released his collection of 
 exotic animals onto the streets of Zanesville, Ohio, before killing himself in 
 October 2011. The authorities were forced to shoot 48 of the dangerous 
 creatures, including tigers, lions and bears, to bring the situation under 
 control. Only six animals survived, and were taken to a local zoo. This film 
 explores the events in Thompson's past that led up to the incident, and 
 includes interviews with the police officers involved.

                                 Enjoy!
