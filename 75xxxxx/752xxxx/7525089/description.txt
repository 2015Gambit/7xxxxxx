Excerpt from Amazon UK's review by Louis Pattison:

"Pomposity, bombast, pretension and prog-rock: they're four
crimes that blight the landscape of modern music and Origin
Of Symmetry--the second record by Teignmouth angst-rockers
Muse--is guilty of every single one. But the truly
astonishing thing about this record is the way it twists
every one of these cardinal musical sins into spectacularly
silly and starkly individual strengths. Where their debut
album Showbiz was rightly dismissed as little more than
Radiohead-lite, here Muse sound defiantly like their own
band."
