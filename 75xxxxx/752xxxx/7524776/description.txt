Sweet - Love is Like Oxygen [Szene, 1978].VOB


HQ very rare promo music video from a promo DVD. "Love is Like Oxygen" is a song from Level Headed, a 1978 album by British rock band Sweet. The album features "Love is Like Oxygen", the band's last original single to hit the top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at #8 in the United States and #9 in the UK Singles Chart. The single version of "Love is Like Oxygen" is substantially shorter than the full album version, and the US version having only the first verse, shorter intermezzo and the funky outro. A second single, "California Nights", was released from the album but only reached #78 in the UK and #76 in the US.

This was the last album to feature the "classic" Sweet line-up of Brian Connolly, Andy Scott, Mick Tucker and Steve Priest. About a year after its release, while working on the next album, Connolly left the band to embark on a solo career. The remaining trio continued as Sweet and delivered three more albums before breaking up in 1982.

Scene was a youth magazine on First German Television, which by 1972 produced and presented each year with the corresponding date (such as ' scene ' 73').

Thomas Gottschalk hosted the scene, which was on Friday afternoon, from 1976 to 1979. Under him, the program developed into a pure music show with Studio performances from bands and supplemented by interviews, as on 16 July 1976 with Kiss and the first video clips, like "I Do not Like Mondays" by The Boomtown Rats. Sidekick Anthony Powell, was at his side in 1977 with slapstick comedy. The last episode ran on 16 November 1979. In 1980, the show returned as Pop-Stop and continued until 1983.
