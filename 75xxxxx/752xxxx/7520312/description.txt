The entirety of Black Butler 2 including the specials. video files have been encoded so that they will be playable on a PS3. The only issue is that the Subtitles apparently decided to hardcode themselves into the video. This does not really take away from being watchable and in my personal opinion makes for an interesting time as you get to see what was originally said and hear what it has been translated into. please seed after downloading as I'm currently seeding multiple torrents.

Format MP4
720x480

Anything else that people would like to see feel free to send me a message. I have a decent amount of Anime in my collection and don't mind uploading, Though i will encourage that if you thoroughly enjoy a series go out a purchase it.
