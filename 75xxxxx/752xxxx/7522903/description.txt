If this looks weird it's because it was performed live and shot in 1957
off the TV monitors with color film, so a color kinescope is what survives.

This was the last half-hour of a 2 hour NBC color block, where Jerry Lewis
only needed the first 90 minutes, so Ernie Kovacs took the remaining time
and much of the show is a long sketch with his silent character Eugene.

The Eugene bit was later remade in one of Ernie's videotaped ABC specials.
