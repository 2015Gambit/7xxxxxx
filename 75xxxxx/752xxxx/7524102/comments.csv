,El_Kabong1,2012-08-13T00:06Z,"Has anyone been able to access the images from WinXP / OSX / Linux? 

The setup.exe program says it only works with Windows Vista/7. :(

I've tried several archive programs with no luck - none of them recognize the PAK format.

,PSHavFun,2012-08-13T16:12Z,"OK, i've installed UnPacker 1.5.0 build 1909 Download, but it says that there is nothing there. Which unpacker program am I looking for?"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-13T23:04Z,"You guys are what? there is a license agreement! Read it and install the free program, but they have a commercial version. So pictures will be unpacked with the program in one folder. This is a publicity stunt, then remove the program, and leave a photo! They will be in the same folder!

There are various discounts and promotions in the private resources of porn ... e-disk."
,El_Kabong1,2012-08-15T23:43Z,"I still can't get the images. The setup.exe program only works with Windows Vista/7. I've tried every other option I can think of but no luck.

Has anybody been able to unpack the files in WinXP / OSX / Linux? If so, please help!

TIA"
