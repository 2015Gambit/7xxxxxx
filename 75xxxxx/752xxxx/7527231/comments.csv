My old imac has ""mountain lion"" and it runs the game just fine.. hope it helps and ""not enough memory to run this game""  is not your computer's memory but your computer's video card memory.."
,silentsea,2012-08-15T03:48Z,"Hey cheers for that, I managed to get past the first problem, before encountering a second. The game runs with no audio (something about ""streaming SIMD extensions)... after a bit of googling, I think it's because I have a retina-display MBP... Could be a no go for me unfortunately. 

Really appreciate all your efforts though, Lasteno :-)"
,posixoddity,2012-08-15T05:49Z,"Works perfectly for me. I am seeding, I would have commented earlier, but I have been playing. Thank you for putting in the effort to get this online. I will continue to seed, and thanks again, cheers!"

,dyvog,2012-08-15T16:55Z,"Hi, i'm sorry maybe im missing something plainly obvious here, but how does one get their own saved game on dawnguard, rather than lasteno's?

,mycophage,2012-08-15T18:13Z,"*** CONVERTING SAVED GAMES FROM OLD VERSIONS OF SKYRIM ***

 (to dyvog and anyone else who is eager to convert their own saves to the new version):

I looked for my saves in my old version of Skyrim, which I downloaded in November 2011 as a torrent from thepiratebay (can't remember which torrent exactly). Originally they were really hard to find, but I eventually hunted them down by looking for subdirectories that changed size when I saved.

Saves (.ess files) don't show up in Finder search. You can, however, find them in Finder if you navigate directly to the right folder.

I found mine here:

/Games/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/%USERPROFILE%/My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves/

Note that I installed Skyrim in a folder in root called ""Games""; yours might be in ""Applications"" instead, but the rest of the path information will be accurate if you use the same version Regarding saved games (to dyvog and anyone else who is eager to convert their own saves to the new version):

This path information will be strictly accurate only if you use the same version of the port that I do. Even if not, this should give people a hint about where to look.

I copied one of my save files into this location in the new Skyrim/Dawnguard app (i.e., downloaded using this torrent:

/Applications/Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim Dawnguard.app/Contents/Resources/drive_c/users/Wineskin/My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves/of the port that I do. Even if not, this should give people a hint about where to look.

Then when I launched Skyrim+Dawnguard, my old game was in the ""LOAD"" menu."
,mycophage,2012-08-15T18:18Z,"I am encountering one weird problem, which is that I am having trouble with key mapping.

In inventory management, the key that is indicated as ""favorite"" (F by default) triggers the ""drop"" response. The key for dropping doesn't seem to do anything. There are a few other problems like this. 

It doesn't seem to extent to keymapping in normal play - I changed lasteno's movement keys to my usual WASD, and those work fine.

Has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, do you know how to fix it? I'm going to try moving around some of the preferences files from my old version of the game to the new one, but I would love some guidance if anyone knows how to fix this.

Thanks in advance..."
,posixoddity,2012-08-15T21:23Z,"@mycophage, I have encountered that, I just kind of mashed on my keyboard until I figured everything out. From what I remember off of the top of my head, z is now the key to refill enchanted weapons, but there were two other keys that were improperly mapped, not that big of a deal after a while of gameplay though."
,mycophage,2012-08-15T22:10Z,"Thanks, though that's not a very satisfying solution - I've been playing a long time and I like my key mappings. 

Besides, the app clearly ""thinks"" that the keys are mapped differently, because the legend at the bottom of the inventory screen has the standard mappings. 

Anyone know where these preferences are stored?

I'll play around with this later today and post if I figure it out."
,mycophage,2012-08-16T03:32Z,"I found it. There's a key map file called ControlMap_Custom.txt. 

In my old version of Skyrim, this file was here:

/Applications/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/

I copied it into this folder:

/Applications/Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim Dawnguard.app/Contents/Resources/drive_c/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/

replacing a file of the same name.

All the keys work now!

I copied it into this loc"

,4fauxsake,2012-08-18T10:46Z,"hey i tried to get this, the download worked fine. then on the home screen of skyrim, when i click on play it gives me this error message that says something like ""failed to initialize renderer,  shader model 3 required but not supported by your video card"" and the screen freezes. also, the homescreen is just a picture with stuff u can click on instead of the normal skyrim scree, i dunno if that matters. but the error message wont let me start the game. i tired to download the xquartz thing u mentioned lasteno, but it didnt do anything. is there something special i need to do with the xquartz thing? i installed it and restarted my comp., but that didnt work either? im a computer dumass, so is there something obvious i didnt do? also, has anyone else gotten this error message?"
,4fauxsake,2012-08-18T10:49Z,"im thinking that this a hardware issue, is in i need newer hardware. but im wondering if that can really be the case, bc my mac is pretty new, (bought it in like early 2011) its a macbook pro with decent hardware shit from what i can tell.. any ideas?"

If you get the error message: go to 'settings and then hit the ""default"" button, that should fix it.

is anyone else not receving perk points for the vampirism skill?"

enable GLSL
- right click on skyrim > show package content
- from there, open wineskin
- select advanced
- select tools and under utilities you will find winetrick, select it
- search for GLSL, it should be under settings, tick and select run.

force use xquartz
-follow step 1 to 2 above and select options, it should be the last option.

automatic screen setting (doubt this has anything to do with the game)
- repeat step 1 to 2, select set screen options on the bottom.
-override controls with these setting are changed to automatic from override"

-GLSL enable
-force xquartz
-screen setting override with rootless (windowed)
-graphics setting (in game) set to default (as mentioned by someone before)

oh, and this might be a hindsight but I'm running on 10.6.8 but this should be the problem as I'm running on xquartz rather than X11."
