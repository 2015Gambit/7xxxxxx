just drag the "Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim Dawnguard" to your desktop and play it

SAVES GAMES GOES TO:

Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim Dawnguard (show package contents) and go to:
Contents/Resources/drive_c/users/Wineskin/My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves/ HERE┬í


if you want to switch between the game and Mac osx without having to close the game just press CMD+ALT+A if you want the game full screen again press CMD+ALT+A again.


one last thing when you quit the game it stucks but press CMD+Q and it will quit the 
game without any problem =)

and don't forget to check in DATA FILES - first Dawnguard
and then Unofficial Skyrim Patch.

and if Data Files Option is unable replace with "Data Files Glitch.zip" files into one folder up where your saves are.

if you lose your saves files you can use mine, just start the game and click continue, and talk to any guard in the cities =)

Good Luck.

I'm not a hacker so I hope this will work for you =) it's been working for me just fine on Mac osx Lion 10.7.4
