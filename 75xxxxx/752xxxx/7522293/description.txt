Excerpt from Amazon UK's review by Rickey Wright:

"Spice Up Your Life, the Spice Girls advise on the first
single from Spiceworld, their second album, which was made
quickly to capitalise on the movie of the same name. If
that sounds more like an advertising slogan than a call for
variety, solidarity, and fun, it's not the only time the
disc echoes the language of a carefully planned campaign:
the chorus of Move Over is built around the phrase
Generation Next, the rallying cry of the their Pepsi
advert. And if, in turn, you come to the conclusion that
this record isn't nearly as much fun as its predecessor,
you're right."
