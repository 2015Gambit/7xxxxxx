Quasar Lux Symphoniae - The Dead Dream (1977) [FLAC]

Genre: Italy, Symphonic Prog Rock


The Dead Dream is the first (and the last) lysergic trip of Quasar L.S. (before Lux Symphoniae`s majestic works),originally dated 1977,recorded again in 1995 because the original tapes were lost,with absolute respect of the original recordings. A psychedelic pearl in a concept album. A visionary and dramatic story too.Not only the psychodrama of Roxy,maybe a soundtrack and an epitaph for the death of the lysergic and hippy dream.
