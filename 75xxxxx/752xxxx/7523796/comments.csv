Today was Cycling Women, Thank you guy. You saved our day. I only watch your upload cause Olympics are only displayed on Nationnal TV. And It sucks. The speaker is a retard. Adds up adds and motherf****ing incessant cuts for Kung-fu, bitch-Volley or who knows what, and you've got taxe-money-waste. Which also means that you are a frigging great Green Skull Sceneline.

And I also know Who wons today. I'm frigging glad. And eager to get your consistent upload for Tomorow, where Mens will run.

Sceneline thanks again, you made me watch the wonderful victory of Vinokourov against these bloody english bastards. He won cause he was brilliant and experienced! Who said it was luck????

If some other seeder(s) may share the same enthousiasm than mine, help would be greatly appreciated.

@ You. You will see tomorow how my country will kill (some again) the Xcountry run.

Up the Hammer!"

I was mistaken. It's BMX! I hate BMX.

looking forwards to get the Xcountry Women from you.

Bestest regards Sceneline."

,crazyoliv,2012-08-11T21:37Z,"I downloaded it in less than 30min!!! Pretty fast!
It took me hours to get the Cycling road Men a few weeks ago (It was queuing just like in Romania).

I will seed a few while.

@ Sceneline. Don't you hesitate to share your kind madness in uploading Cycling Cross Country Womew (Today, at noon GMT) and Men (Tomorrow 1pm GMT).
Whatever, you are impressively consistent. Or you stuck to the Olymipic all summer! hahaha  "
