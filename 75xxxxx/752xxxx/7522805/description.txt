It's a bloody showdown between Dracula, and the Vatican's paramilitary wing, Cestus Dei. Vlad has new tricks up his sleeves, alliances with old gods that make Order and Chaos tremble, and his plans of unholy conquest are on the verge of success. Of course, Vampirella might have something to say about that.
