,franmadcow,2012-08-15T20:29Z,cam rip?
,Rush,2012-08-17T06:00Z,"@franmadcow
""cam rip""   wtf? VOD = video on demand, it's ripped by stream from either Cable or Satellite and stored as a video file. Usually not as good as DVDrip but done correctly it can be very close.

Thanx Hackulus ........youdaman"
