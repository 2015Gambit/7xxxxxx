Gidi Gidi Maji Maji (also known as GidiGidi MajiMaji or GidigidiMajimaji) is a Kenyan hip hop duo from Nairobi. Its two members are Maji Maji (Julius Owino) and Gidi Gidi (Joseph Oyoo). Their lyrics are mostly in Luo language, with some English and Swahili. Unlike most local hip hop artists, GidiGidi MajiMaji do willingly mix African rhythms with their music. Their biggest hit to date is the single Unbwogable from an album of the same name. The song was also adopted as an anthem for Mwai Kibaki's victorious presidential election campaign in 2002. The opposition severally used their favorite song "Unbwogable" as their political anthem.
