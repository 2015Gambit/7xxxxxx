MySQL Cluster Quick Start Guide ΓÇô Windows

This guide is intended to help the reader get a simple MySQL Cluster database up and running on a single Windows server. Note that for a live deployment multiple hosts should be used to provide redundancy but a single host can be used to gain familiarity with MySQL Cluster; please refer to the final section for links to material that will help turn this into a production system.
