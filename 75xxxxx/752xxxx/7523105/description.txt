Description:-

VueScan - the program to work with scanners HP, Minolta, Nikon, Polaroid, Epson, Canon and others. Can work with internal color depth. VueScan supports automatic and manual settings of most parameters and batch scanning. Supported by more than 700 models of scanners with a certain superiority in the slide scanners - Nikon, Minolta, Polaroid, Microtek, Epson.

There are automatic removal of image defects due to the channel infrared scanning and multipass scanning and averaging the result - to suppress the intrinsic noise of the scanner. There are filters suppress grain, unsharp masking and removal of spurious color original. There are means of manual adjustment of dynamic range and gradation characteristics (regardless of the channels R, G, B).

In most cases, a standard device driver has very limited capacity to adjust the scan settings. Using the often hidden opportunities specific scanner, VueScan allows you to flexibly configure the image processing, including advanced color correction capabilities and multi-batch scanning hardware adjust the exposure, the choice of the maximum color depth and format of your files. Of great interest is the function of preserving the original scanner data to a file (raw file) and the subsequent processing of this data when device is turned off, eliminating the need to rescan the originals and increases equipment life.

Use VueScan is especially true when working with transparent originals (negatives, slides), as The program contains information on the color characteristics of more than 150 types of films. It is, above all, the mask of color negatives, which may differ in different films and producers. The program has a direct selection of masks from the list of popular films, as well as the ability to manually adjust the color components of the masking layer. Custom settings can be saved in a special file that allows you to create individual profiles for each type of work.
