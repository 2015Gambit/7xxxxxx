Ayn Rand did once vote for FDR, as a lesser evil - based on the egregious lies of his campaign.  And she did take back as ""Social Security"" some of the money that the government stole throughout her life as taxes.  Those two nitpicked factoids have very little significance in the grand scheme of things - to single them out is just as intellectually dishonest as it would be to summarize Hitler as ""a vegetarian who loved to paint animals""!

It is also inaccurate to dismiss her works as just ""fiction"".  Some of her works were what are called ""philosophical novels"", which use a fictional setting for the purpose of presenting serious and complex philosophical arguments.  In numerical terms, the majority of her works were non-fiction, as is this particular torrent.  Other works of non-fiction based on her philosophy were written by other people.

I suggest you study all of them - as well as related subjects in the philosophy of science, political history, and especially economics."
