,JerombaCZ,2012-08-10T23:16Z,"I'm getting ""could not create server: 6"" both on campaign ( after pressing start ) and skirmish

found this line in lognetwork.txt

""PegasusApp: Singleplayer couldn't start because there is no server.""

multiplayer LAN ctd

also alt+tab to desktop doesn't let me back to game"
[V],extremezone,2012-08-10T23:29Z,Update: Legends.of.Pegasus.Update.1-SKIDROW google for it if you need it
,thxforthehelp2,2012-08-10T23:39Z,Slow as fuck so many downloaders! Well as usual an undoubtedly clean and working upload by extremezone thanks for it!
,shinieris,2012-08-11T01:24Z,"Wait, is this the full version? How could you guys get it and crack it so quickly? I thought it's due on 14th August?"
,obliveron,2012-08-11T02:13Z,"game was released 2 weeks ago @ the internets. dumb question is dumb. now que the SEEEDDD OMFG, requests for crap that he cant upload yet because it isnt out or cracked yet - like just because some tard asks for something hes gonna drop everything and find it and upload it for you- he'll get to it when he can hes been uploading stuff for a long time now and doesnt need someone that just downloaded his first torrent to tell him how to do it. also 99% of what EZ ups is perfect and on that 1% most of the time its not his fault and he will post links to how to fix it. anyway tyvm EZ much love for everything you do."
,obliveron,2012-08-11T02:19Z,"but if your ""that guy"" thats the only one having trouble. hint - your doing it wrong. retrace your steps and do it again. if you try more than 5 times to fix it and its still not working either you need to stop downloading torrents and just pay for things because your obviously not intelligent enough or you need upgrade your system. i know alot of ppl cant afford to hence why most of us are here to begin with. but yea you cant play skyrem on Kaliko Vision."
,hhavok,2012-08-11T02:39Z,"Weird, installed the game, patched, cracked. Fired it up, checked the options, can only change resolution and not the quality? What the heck?
Then I tried to start campaign but I couldn't click on start button. I tried skirmish, start button doesn't work even after I click it 10000 times. I'd say it's a broken torrent, considering I've been downloading games from TPB for a very long time with barely any issues."
,thxforthehelp2,2012-08-11T04:17Z,did a full install crack and with update working fine thanks again
,JuggernautOfWar,2012-08-11T05:28Z,"Alright I've been downloading torrents forever and never once had any problems. I am however with this. I installed the game, copied crack, and started the game. I cannot start the campaign or skirmish once in game just like hhavok. Very strange.

He mentioned something about a patch, but I don't see one anywhere. Am I missing something here?"
,JerombaCZ,2012-08-11T12:44Z,"obliveron why you act like angry retard? We all know that you were born in tube with 100% knowledge of everything but all of us ain't as perfect as you are. We are humans, we discover new things in our life and we learn to use them. We like advices and help more then hating and insulting. Remember it next time you will decide to act like this"
,Ch4rr0n,2012-08-11T12:48Z,"thx a lot for the u/l, been waiting for it  BUT... total disappointed right now, the torrent works just fine but the game itself... it's rubbish, i think they released it before they have the chance to finish it... maybe some future patches will solve that "
,shinieris,2012-08-11T12:49Z,"If Obliveron's comment was aimed at me, than I'm very annoyed. What's your damage? Why so confrontational? I wasn't belittling extremezone, I was asking a question.

Steam said it will only be out one the 14th, and even Kalypso website is still only just updating Archrox trailer. It was a valid question.

I assure you that I have been using torrents for over 6 years, before they even used magnet links. Heck, when I started, I don't think anyone had ever heard of magnet links. So I'm not a noob if that's what you're implying.

Regardless, thanks extremezone. Works fine so far. Keep up the good uploads."
,shinieris,2012-08-11T12:52Z,"@ Juggernaut Maybe he meant this? http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7521406/Legends.of.Pegasus.Update.1-SKIDROW

It's not extremezone upload, but he did say to google it."
,ckraven,2012-08-11T13:29Z,installed the game and the update but still I get black screen ..something seems to be going on but not really task manager simple says that loP is not responding .. any ideas ?
,_Zi0N_,2012-08-11T14:56Z,SKIDROW ARE BEST! thank you skidrow and thank you extremezone. keep the good work 
,nokeout,2012-08-11T16:53Z,hey EZ when are u gonna upload sleeping dogs and the amazing spider man 
,Ciupearca,2012-08-11T16:58Z,"For those of you who can`t start the campaign, make sure you click human and episode one (like you would select them). The play button will be pressable. Then you will get a black screen and nothing will happen. Just alt-tab, and alt-tab again back to the game. It should start in a couple of seconds.
You`re welcome"
,JuggernautOfWar,2012-08-11T19:28Z,"Once the screen turned black I just had to wait for ~45 seconds for the loading screen to slowly appear. Don't alt-tab or anything, just sit for a minute and let it catch it's breath.

In other news don't even waste your time downloading this half finished game. I got through the first two campaign missions (barely) and regretted wasting my time.

I really hope they will update the game with future patches. It has great potential, but honestly feels like an internal alpha build of the game. Go onto the Steam forums and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Thanks for the great upload though!"
,notdone23,2012-08-11T19:52Z,After i load a saved game and hit start button i get the same black screen waiting does nothing alt-tab does nothing as well i already installed the Update as well. 
,thxforthehelp2,2012-08-11T20:20Z,Yeah for you 4x fans out here its another sword of the stars 2 you can still play but its not easy camera is pretty wacked
,IzayaOrihara,2012-08-12T02:54Z,"Just a fair warning to all the people getting this: The game is horribly broken and has many problems. Not because of this torrent, but because the people that made it released it in an unfinished state. 

Me, along with many other user reviewers on several websites, agree that the game is currently unplayable and will need many patches and fixes before it's worth playing.

Broken Menu Buttons, Frequent Black Screens, no Graphic Options except for Resolution, and poor UI Design plagues this game currently."
,Pharmit24,2012-08-12T04:43Z,please upload The Amazing Spiderman Full Unlocked version thanks..
,cubit481,2012-08-12T06:22Z,plz extremezone can u upload amazing spiderman...
,xpmule,2012-08-12T06:53Z,"what is with the .jp in your torrent ?
this is like the 30th game i've seen you upload with that in it..

its you obviously because the email address for your GROUP is the same name in the jpeg file name lol"
,xpmule,2012-08-12T06:59Z,"im surprised you havn't been arrested *yet
what you say your group wants sounds like a honey pot lol
And posting msn/gmail add's publicly too ? WOW

FBI or Homeland etc etc makes one call
and they can access your emails in a heart beat and they would be more than willing to give you a seedbox lol

Are you even remotely aware of the risk you are taking to get attention at TPB ?
I'm not trying to be a jerk i just think it looks like your oblivious to the risks involved with PC Game cracking groups and related etc

People REALLY do go to jail you know !"
,JerombaCZ,2012-08-12T07:52Z,"they want 40âŹ for this shit, unbelievable"

,XtraZoom,2012-08-13T03:54Z,"Such a shitty game and buggy as hell even with Update 1. I thought Endless Space was bad this is definitely worse. Looks like n00bs making the game heck some indie games are way, way better than this. I am going to delete the file just not worth it."
,manofwor,2012-08-14T02:51Z,"ok im having trouble starting the game, i have mounted, installed, and copyed over the crack but im getting and error after trying to lauch the game - The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. please see application even long or sue the command -line skstrace.exe tool for more detail-, if anyone can hlep me figure out how to fix this i would be much appricatied, but if tried capibilty and admistrater and everyting can figurei it out plz help"

,FureeTutawk,2012-08-19T17:17Z,"People are being hateful here just because someone says it doesn't work. Well, it isn't working for me either. Instead of calling me an idiot, maybe someone with some REAL knowledge could be of assistance. I am sure it must have something to do with the variety of OS's and other environmental elements. I am windows XP. First it wouldn't work due to a .dll file missing. I found it in the redist. cab and extracted it to the game directory. On that attempt, it said it wasn't a valid game file. So, even though I use net frame 4, and am newer with the C++, etc., I reinstalled and opted to have those items installed (figuring perhaps the .dll and other things needed to be extracted during installation to work). Installation proceeded to tell me I had newer versions of all this stuff on my pc and those parts failed to install. But, when, this time, I copied the SKIDROW folder items to the main installed directory, the game tried to start without saying anything was missing. However, after a moment of a black screen fading and darkening, the error message says the game encountered and error and must close. It doesn't say what kind of error, and it always happens. Now, if you want to call me stupid just because it happens to work on your machine, you must be about 15 years old. Is there anyone out there with some experience in this?"
,komoros,2012-08-19T22:17Z,wow its so buggy its unreal...
,ironymon,2012-09-13T16:23Z,Before you start whining like teens on hormone changes... download latest updates.
