Easy.
Transmission Is Designed For Easy, Powerful Use. We've Set The Defaults To ΓÇ£Just WorkΓÇ¥ And It Only Takes A Few Clicks To Configure Advanced Features Like Watch Directories, Bad Peer Blocklists, And The Web Interface. When Ubuntu Chose Transmission As Its Default BitTorrent Client, One Of The Most-Cited Reasons Was Its Easy Learning Curve.
Lean.
In Separate Benchmarks, Linux Format And Lacrocivious Both Found Transmission To Use Less CPU Than Any Other GUI Client. It Even Used Less CPU Than Some Non-GUI Clients.
Transmission Also Has The Lowest Memory Footprint Of Any Major BitTorrent Client.
Imageshack Chose Transmission For Its BitTorrent Farms Because The Competition ΓÇ£Requires Amounts Of Memory Several Times Greater Than TransmissionΓÇ¥.
Transmission's Small Footprint Is One Reason Why Many Home Device Manufacturers, Such As FON, Belkin, And Networked Media Tank Ship With Transmission. When Belkin And Vuze Inc. Partnered To Write A ΓÇ£Torrent GenieΓÇ¥ To Let People Who Ran Vuze And Owned A Belkin Router Keep Sharing Files Even When Vuze Wasn't Running, They Decided To Use Transmission -- Not Vuze's Own BitTorrent Client -- On The Router.
Native.
Unlike Many Cross-Platform Applications, Transmission Integrates Seamlessly With Your Operating System.
The Mac OS X Interface Is Written In Objective-C And Uses Growl Notifications And Dock Badging To Keep You Informed.

ΓÇ£It's Fast, It's Extremely Lightweight, And ΓÇö Even Though It's Available For A Variety Of Platforms ΓÇö It Behaves Just As You'd Expect A Mac Program To.ΓÇ¥ 
Macworld, Naming Transmission A ΓÇ£Mac GemΓÇ¥
