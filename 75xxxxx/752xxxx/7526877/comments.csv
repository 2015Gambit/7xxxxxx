You have no idea how time-consuming it was to do all that. Finding the episodes to download, try to find subtitles to fit, renaming every episode with its title, checking that subs are in synch for every episode, cleaning up the hearing impaired notations with Kerensky TAC. The subtitles are not complete for either TV rips or DVD so trying to match them up took quite a while and I couldn't find English subs for the pilot anywhere. I had collected all these files for my hard of hearing friend, so I thought I might as well share it since the work was already done. Someone else might like to find a complete set of these episodes without looking all over the internet for them like I had to do, so here they are. 

I only have about 300-400 kB/s bandwidth to share, so it will take a while to get this properly seeded. I am seeing a problem with the pilot episode. In utorrent it is showing I only have 98.9% of that file in the upload folder. I copied in another full file to take care of it and shut down and re-opened utorrent to refresh it, but when I do it changes back to an incomplete file again. It shows the very first segment is missing in the file section of utorrent, but when I double click to play it no problem. There is a complete file there also but I can't make utorrent recognize it. Force recheck is grayed out so that won't work either. 

If the pilot episode can't be downloaded complete I may have to upload it again separately. It does not seem to be available at TPB. I am hoping this error isn't real and it will upload completely. Please post and let me know if it works. TPB doesn't notify me of posts but I will check occasionally.

If !ut is appended to your incomplete files, deleting the !ut on the pilot should make it playable or burnable. Since there are no subs for that episode the missing 8 MB on the very first piece won't affect the playability. "
,Saki33,2012-08-13T20:08Z,"Fixed. I removed the pilot episode from the folder, closed utorrent, and restarted. Now it showed an error and I then moved the file back into the folder and was now able to force recheck. It now shows the file at 100%.

Sorry about the brief interruption while rechecking."

,Saki33,2012-08-16T05:52Z,"For anyone who needs English hearing impaired annotated subtitles, they are available at addic7ed.com for every episode  except the pilot. That's where I got all these before I removed the annotations. You will download dvd or tv rip subs depending on how I have labeled the files. If more than one, and you're not sure, just download all three of them and use the one that synchs. Foreign language subs are also available at the site."

Attention all seeders. Please continue to seed after completion. This d/l is taking a lot of time. Thanks "
,LochDhueDude,2012-09-11T16:56Z,Great post! Thanks for taking the time to get the subs...
