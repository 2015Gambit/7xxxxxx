QC 41 - Nuclei Bonding

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

Building on the residue Electric field geometry of all Baryons the attractive force that instigates the bonding of separate Baryon[ic] particles and their arrangement into know atomic nuclei is revealed.

Insulators and conductive properties are explained along with the electron configuration of elemental nuclei

The forty -first chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
