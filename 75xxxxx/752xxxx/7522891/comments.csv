[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-08-18T19:20Z,"Excellent, thank you. Why does Apple make it so difficult to back up your iPod? I wanted to do a purely iPod backup on my MacBookPro, rather than sync with my main music library on the iMac (which is backed up anyway). This software gives you the option of protecting your chosen portable sounds. Very good, openarena, again thanks!"

Just remember not to upgrade AFTER putting the SN in.
Thank you very much, uploader."
