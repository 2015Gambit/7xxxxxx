,ohess,2012-08-21T21:31Z,"After I just commented on your great uploads, I tried to watch the game, and for the first I have problems. The picture sticks with a lot of pauses continuously, and digital blocking. Really unwatchable. I think anything more than 360p. gives me problems because my computer has very little ram memory. I'm not able to buy a new computer just to watch sporting events, so can you do uploads at 360p. Thanks Bud :)   "
