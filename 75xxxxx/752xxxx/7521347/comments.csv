but when i open the game, its still trying to download 800+ MB data 
did i do something wrong or?
some pointers would help :)
thank u"
,vicky103,2012-08-12T08:41Z,"when i try to install apk file , it shows ""There is a problem parsing the package"""
,vicky103,2012-08-12T08:57Z,@cop3rth   Just rename the sd data folder to 'com.ea.game.realracing2_row' and it will work :)
,vicky103,2012-08-12T09:15Z,"working great on my S2 , thanks"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-12T09:20Z,"@cop3rth

Good day.Did what vicky103 said and you will be fine.If it will ask again to download the data open wifi and download them it takes only some minutes with a high speed connection.

@vicky103

Maybe the apk version isnt compatible with your device."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-12T09:21Z,"@vicky103

You said it says the parsing errors before.Its in other phone or you do something else to overpass this problem?"
,vicky103,2012-08-12T09:32Z,@bobiras22  I downloaded another apk torrent  and it worked
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-12T09:45Z,"@vicky103

So maybe this apk is not for your device chipset because in others galaxy s2 it worked fine.The data is the same of all devices.Happy gaming."
,sen3ca,2012-08-12T17:47Z,"@bobiras22

I've double checked the data is placed /Android/Data/ and the name of the folder is correct, but whenever I boot it requests to download the data again.

Due to a bug with the Nexus 7, even if I am to download the data again, it'll hang at 42%.

The APK installs fine, but it isn't recognizing I have the data installed."
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-12T18:10Z,"@sen3ca

Make the data folder name (com.ea.game.realracing2_row) and run the game again."
,sen3ca,2012-08-12T18:26Z,"I renamed it that without the brackets... same results.

Are you on IRC?"
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-12T18:40Z,"@sen3ca

Wait you extract the rar file that i have in the torrent?"
,sen3ca,2012-08-12T19:07Z,"Yes, I extract your .rar and get com.ea.game.realracing2_OTD_row

I then dragged this folder on sdcard/Android/Data
and renamed it to com.ea.game.realracing2_row

Unfortunately I'm still prompt to download via wifi.

Am I supposed to edit the real racing folder in data/data?

Thanks for the help."
,sen3ca,2012-08-12T19:13Z,weird my comment disappeared..
[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-12T19:35Z,"@sen3ca

In some devices the real racing need to download some extra data.In a high speed connection it will make only some minutes.Download the extra data and enjoy the game."
