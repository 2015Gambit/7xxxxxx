,jmmybttm,2012-08-12T18:33Z,"Thanks MozartFX - glad to put them up but they are not popular enough to generate constant traffic, so after the initial seed, they go dead quick except for one or two of them. Anything in particular you want? jmmybttm"
,NdluvTPB,2012-08-26T22:59Z,"Thanks very much for these classics.  One suggestion i have for you to keep these alive would be to bundle them into one collection. People interested in these might initially just want one or two but if they see them in a bundle theyre likely to just get the whole thing. Anyone wanting a specific one can still isolate it in their torrent client.

Thanks again"
