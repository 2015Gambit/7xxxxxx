,Slendymen,2012-08-14T00:58Z,"Every torrent I have gotten from you has worked perfectly! Until this one unfortunately. It downloads fine, nice and quick, but when I run the launcher and click 'Play', it starts with some music then ends immediately. (Also I allowed Reg Entries) Any help for this? "
[V],gansuk,2012-08-14T09:05Z,"the game is well known for been buggy, even with all the patches installed. your best bet is to try fallout3 nexus or wiki to try find a solution."
,Mechine,2012-08-14T11:19Z,"Put them in this order with Fallout mod manager.

Fallout3.esm
ThePitt.esm
Anchorage.esm
BrokenSteel.esm
PointLookout.esm
Zeta.esm"
,Reilana,2012-08-16T02:31Z,"I seem to have run into a bit of a wall...
Game installed fine, added to registry and all that, starts up fine but on the menu screen my curser is invisible and there's this PipOS error 26
                                   [File not found]"
,crazyman1,2012-08-16T06:43Z,"@Reilana

dude i have the same exact problem like you...no mouse pointer, error 26 everywhere, and crashes after the intro during the baby birth...looks like this time kaos rip is fucked up ....but buddy could u tell me the folder size after installation pls...i think thsi is not ripped fully....mine is 8.33gb wats urs?? and gansuk is this the final size of the installed folder??? your other rips worked flawlessly for me, but expect this one...."
,crazyman1,2012-08-16T06:44Z,and i reinstalled at least 5 times both in may lap and desktop and still the same problem
[V],gansuk,2012-08-16T19:14Z,"the errors are caused by games for windows live.

download the ""Games for Windows LIVE Disabler""
for fallout click enable and then disable. everything should be fine after that.

if you cant find a copy you can get it from our website."
[V],gansuk,2012-08-16T21:00Z,"heres an easier way to fix it.

replace your fallout_default.ini in your game folder with this one.
www-sendspace-com/file/9ppn12

make sure u delete 
""%USERPROFILE%Documentsmy gamesfallout3Fallout.ini""
first."
[V],gansuk,2012-08-16T21:02Z,"if you only just installed the game, replace the file before you run the launcher and it will be fine."
,fluster84,2012-08-18T21:01Z,"Thank you gansuk, I replaced the fallout_default.ini file and now the game works perfectly.

Downloaded, installed and now running without a single problem. Awesome job by the Kaos crew as usual. Thanks guys."
,ArgyleKnight,2012-08-18T21:21Z,"I'm getting error 26, and I'm not sure i understand the solution of replacing the .ini file.  How do i get to your website to download games for windows live disabler?"
,seos777,2012-08-18T22:51Z,game works but getting same trouble that someone posted recently pls help me wanna play this one so badly dunno what to do ??? :(
,seos777,2012-08-18T23:00Z,Uhm pls help i game shows the intro movie everything u here how child is born but after that pitch darkness pressed ctrl+alt+del and it says game isn't responding help me gansuk pls 
,seos777,2012-08-19T07:21Z,Gansuk i am still having turouble after i did everything u said but still game is not repsonding
,Thepclova,2012-08-19T18:22Z,"Everything is totally working.
just Replace the file mentioned by GANSUK and you are all set for play.
Awesome torrent.
Kaos and Gansuk, thank you very much :D"
,Thepclova,2012-08-19T18:59Z,"The quality of the radio songs in the game are very badly coded.
Low volume lot of disturbance.
But radio announcements are very clear.
sound is of 85% quality, throught the game, compared to bigger non ripped versions of the game !!
If small size is the only thing that matters to you, then this rip is for you.
Still i appreciate the Uploaders hard work!!"
[V],gansuk,2012-08-22T11:29Z,"@Thepclova actually the audio sounds almost identical to the original, im assuming this is because its meant to be old radio station.
all the audio was done the same way so if the radio was bad the rest would be the same.

@seos777 if you got the game started there's not i great deal i can do. the games well known for random crashes and freezing on some systems, also buggy and broken in game triggers preventing you from completing certain missions or even progressing any further in the game. your best off trying to google your issue.

p.s playing around with the gfx settings in the launcher also the advanced gfx options did correct alot of issues for some people."
,LachyB,2012-08-22T13:43Z,"Hey gansku
Thanks for this great game, but one problem, no matter how many times i install it again, when i get to the new game loading screen where it talks about vault 101, it then says Fallout3 has stopped working every time. Can you plz help?
Thanks
LahyB"
,Thepclova,2012-08-22T15:44Z,"@gansuk 
oh alright bro, i think you are right.
If all of the sounds in the game are coded the same way,then i dint notice anything bad except for the radio.
Guess i was wrong on this.
But thank you so much for the rip.I will Seed for a long time :D
Superb Rip!!!!!!!"
,Thepclova,2012-08-22T15:50Z,"What does rebuilding mean? 
how distant is it from the original sounds of the game?
Please,it would be kind of you to explain this to me.
Im seeding both the NEW VEGAS rip and this one.
fan of KAOS since the original FALLOUT 3 rip had come out,few years back :D"
[V],gansuk,2012-08-22T23:43Z,"damn that was along time ago lol.

rebuild is a term we use to describe changing from one format to another to save space, an example would be wav to mp3 or dds to jpg.
in almost all cases this means lossy.
its not possible to say what the exactly quality is compared to the original but personally i could barley tell the difference and i knew exactly what to look and listen for."
,Thepclova,2012-08-23T02:43Z,"Right on! you the man Gansuk :D
Now everything is clear to me.thank you again.
The problem with you guys not getting enough seeds is because most people just cant believe a game could be this small and never give you guys a try and think its fake..
for example : Reloaded, he uploads the rip the way it is and he gets all the seeds.
but you are the guys who put in so much hardwork, compacting everything to the last possible size and the torrent fades out..
Your business is tough.I dont know how you guys do it...
But please keep going...!! 
Dont ever get demotivated :)"
,manobal,2012-08-27T11:42Z,well the solution is download unofficial patch from nexus and then as this game does not work well with multi cored processor you would face crashes the solution is making changes in fallout ini. ( after you patch it shld run but if it crash copy the error name and they would tell you how to make it run on 2 cores.) The game works like a charm but yes radio is gibberish apart from announcements .. That is i guess due to compression. But it is an integral part so i would like it to be ok if anyone can help please.. tell me abt the radio... great work compressing game team KaOs
,wanobi22,2012-08-31T20:05Z,"This is a small download in comparison to other games, so it is downloading very quickly.  Just be sure to download the .ini file found in the comments section.

Excellent work to the team for bringing smaller files"
,wanobi22,2012-08-31T20:34Z,45 minutes for a full game download is not bad at all
,JustYourAverageUsername,2012-09-01T23:56Z,"Hey, guys, bit new to this pirating of games thing, I usually only do it with movies or songs but I decided to do it with games too. Anyway, It says after I finish with Install.exe I should run FalloutNVLauncher.exe, the problem is I cannot find it. I probably sound like an idiot, but some help is always appreciated. "
,JustYourAverageUsername,2012-09-02T00:57Z,"Okay, so I found how to launch it but when I do I cannot see my mouse. I am still able to use it, but I hover over something I hear a click, and I am able to perform actions with it I just am unable to see it. "
,matej2903,2012-09-03T21:35Z,"when i click on fallout3launcher it says ""unable to find an INI file.please reinstall fallout""

and then after that when i click on Play in fallout3 menu
it says  ""fallout 3 does not appear to be installed and installer could not br found.""
""try to exploring to your dvd-rom drive and selecting setup.exe to install game.""

any help?
"
,facepalmm,2012-09-09T20:43Z,"When I try running the 'install', it works fine until I choose the file path and click 'unrar' it says that 'there is an error while unpacking the rar-archive -->12' wtf does this mean and how do I fix it?!"
[V],gansuk,2012-09-12T01:09Z,"@facepalmm try a force recheck on the torrent in your torrent client, the error is due to a faulty download and a recheck should correct it.

@matej2903 read the kaos.nfo what comes in this release and the previous comments. your answers are there.
