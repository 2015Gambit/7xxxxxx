,XHaloXX,2012-08-10T17:23Z,"this doesnt seem fake, i looked at the uploader profile and he has legit uploads and he clearly states there is no crack.

So i dont think this is fake, this is the retail DVD i think, but im not gonna download it because i prefer scene releases."

So I'm supposed to believe you, someone who has no torrents whatsoever who is telling me to trust an unknown uploader with pretty much unrated torrents? That's not going to happen, especially with the first instruction: ""Disable Antivirus and firewall""."

,Insomneac,2012-08-11T02:54Z,"Why the fuck would you need to disable a firewall to install a game?
