,.Leto.,2012-08-13T01:01Z,"not a fake, this is a legit release. and about that ""4gb WTF???"" -> 2h39 - 1280 x 720 - 3 192 Kbps = 4GB
so many retarded comments on this site...
anyway, thanks for the upload, awesome main fight!!"
,enonumus,2012-08-13T15:24Z,"A10/V10  It's the real deal, and nice quality.  

The size is correct for a 2.5+ hour, 720P action feature shot with hand held cameras, which requires a high bitrate.  If you want a faster download, settle for one of the standard-def torrents.  Won't comment on the fight itself of course.  Nothing worse than someone leaving a torrent comment about who won, but idiots still continue to do it."
,Meuputo,2012-08-13T20:33Z,"Thank you. Good release, and only release in 720p of this."
,MrFisty,2012-08-13T23:34Z,"Good quality.
This is being tracked by Zuffa."
,SirMoethe1st,2012-08-14T04:57Z,"Thank you very much for the sample! I wanted to play this on the PS3 and for anyone else wondering it didn't show up on my PS3, however it played on my laptop and the quality was very good. So while i didn't benefit from the download i'm glad i didn't waste time downloading, so thanks for the sample and this is a legit file."
,MrFisty,2012-08-14T14:50Z,"@ SirMoethe1st, the PS3 will not display and can't play ANY MKV file natively. You would need to transcode it with a media server like Plex of PS3 Media Server to play MKVs on your PS3."
,hwadsworth,2012-08-19T04:24Z,"Uploaded at 2.1 mb average. Thanks for the post, despite the size. Loaded really fast!"
,hwadsworth,2012-08-19T07:13Z,NOT WORKING - ALL BLACK - THANKS BUT NO THANKS!!!
,solodude,2012-09-05T20:51Z,"So if this is being tracked by Zuffa, is there a way ""cloak"" myself before downloading? I've already had a few emails from my ISP from downloading certain files on TPB. Don't wanna push it."
