Museum Secrets Collection 
On a quest to find the best, and most obscure, museum exhibits and explore the secrets they hold, Museum Secrets uncovers the weird, the astonishing and fascinating wonders of the world. What unexpected device did Catherine the Great use to enhance her sex life? Why did Alexander the Great prefer linen armour to bronze? And how did the falcon hunting of the Habsburg emperors lay the foundations for modern science? Testing out the theories behind the artifacts and visiting the sites they originated from, this series combines pure enthralling history with surprising detective work.




12)  Royal Ontario Museum 
This eye-popping Toronto landmark is a national treasure chest - Canada's largest museum of culture, archaeology and natural history, containing more than 6 million artifacts, and visited by over a million people every year. We unwrap a tiny mummy to find out how an Egyptian baby died 2000 years ago. We won't spill the secret of how the baby mummy died (you'll have to watch the episode) but we will tell you the secret behind the secret: The ancient Egyptians were not who most of us think they were. You might think, in any museum, the only good bug is a dead bug. But in the ROM, below the public galleries we find insects in the MILLIONS. All very much ALIVE!
