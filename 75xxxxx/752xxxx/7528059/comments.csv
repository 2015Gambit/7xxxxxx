,jess_CRO,2012-08-20T15:03Z,"rkstr ignore him, sounds like some turd who is bored and has nothing better to do then bitch about reality tv on this site lol why dont you bitch on your facebook bryentheartist? is it because nobody will respond, have to have friends for a response. What does WOP mean anyway? was it suppose to be Wog, because like nick G says ""better smile when you say that word"" :)"
