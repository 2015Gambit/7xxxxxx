This time Max and Stacy discuss the US empire stumbling into the City of London with a trickle down shakedown, after the British poodle bites the hand that feeds it. They also ask the Obama administration to either arrest the banksters for their crimes or to stop fining them as it only leads to a bigger crime wave to pay for the fines. And notice that a good way to censor the financial news is for banking fraudsters to lace their incriminating emails with expletives. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Karl Denninger of the Market-Ticker.org about high frequency trading and how to stop its use for front-running and fraud.
