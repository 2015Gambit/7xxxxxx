Release Notes....: You will noticed several unnatural cuts in this release starting somewhere in
                   the second quarter. I left the injected commercials/game updates early on but
                   there were so fucking many of them throughout this broadcast, I thought it
                   best to remove as many as possible. The concurrent game updates were 
                   especially unwelcome since they're full of spoilers. I did my best to make
                   cuts considering the audio and video. Don't worry, you won't miss anything
                   important. Also, I removed the full-time ticker at the bottom. Thanks NFL
                   Network for scrolling final scores of the games that you haven't aired yet.
