,pether,2012-08-13T00:52Z,This game is totaly fucked up. The camera will just start going in one direction and nothing is going to stop it. Makes it impossible to play until they release a patch.

Thankfully, we have Pirate Bay, which allows us to test our product before we actually buy it. Yarrr!"
