,BagOfMoney,2012-09-02T20:44Z,"There is a NEW 4.9.6 Loader that has been released for SAM 4.9.6, but when I tested it, it crashed SAM, So, I'll save headaches and leave it where it is. Just use 4.9.0/4.9.1/4.9.2. They work fine!

If anyone wants the 4.9.6 loader, you can just email me at: gemini365@gmail.com and I'll send it to you to test out."
