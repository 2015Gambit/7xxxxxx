SAM Broadcaster is your radio station in a box. Everything needed for operating an online radio station on the professional or enthusiastic hobbies level. SAM Broadcaster delivers professional sound with cross fading, gap killer, beat matching, volume normalization, and 5-band compressor or limiter. You are able to encode aacPlusv2, MP3, mp3PRO, WM9, and Ogg playing on Winamp, Windows Media Player, Live365, and MusicMatch.
Preview tracks before you air them, queue the next song at just the right position, calculate a song's beats per minute (BPM) for better transitions, put the DSP effects on a single channel or several combined channels, encode at multiple bitrates at the same time, and manage a large media library.
