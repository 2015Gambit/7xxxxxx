,TheJackDanuls,2012-08-14T03:39Z,Why so many parts?  This is crazy.
,dididie,2012-08-14T04:31Z,Worst quality PPV Rip I have come across on piratebay for the past three years.  Quality is worse than the live streaming sites you can find.  Video cuts out and jumps around.  Not watchable.  Same quality as his prior one.  Stay away from this uploader.  
,surenlokka,2012-08-18T05:07Z,Quality is OK...
