A Year in the Wild
The breathtaking landscapes and spectacular wildlife of some of Britain's most iconic National Parks, seen through the eyes of people who know them best, Hermione Norris purrs narration over enchanting images of the crags and valleys of the National Parks. The film takes a dim view of the tourists who flock to the area, but sorry, programmes like this will only encourage us.




3)  Cairngorms 
The harsh beauty and surprising wildlife of Scotland's Cairngorms National Park through the eyes of the people who know it best. The Cairngorms is Britain's largest and wildest National Park. A land of Arctic extreme in the heart of the Scottish highlands. Its granite mountains and ancient pine forests are home to some of our rarest and most spectacular animals, including golden eagles, ptarmigan, capercaillie, red deer and crested tits. This lyrical and thought-provoking film reveals the inner secrets of this wild landscape over a year through the eyes of individuals who know and love the Cairngorms: a mountain guide, an artist, a salmon ghillie, a gamekeeper and a nature writer
