,rguy,2012-08-12T02:01Z,tyyyy didnt think it ever was gonna come
,dlawhorn77,2012-08-15T14:29Z,I have an episode that i downloaded called the gypsy hunter which shows up on top of the list before doggin and draggin on the official trutv site...can someone help me out and let me know which episode number that would fall under...i know that it aired before the 100th episode and after doggin and draggin...so that should be ep 10 and ep 10 should be 11...thats what i am thinking but please correct me if i am wrong.
,twijjit,2012-08-16T06:55Z,"I read your comment to a friend over the phone who keeps up with the show with me, and I did a little digging as well. This episode here, has the tattoo-headed guy who shot the office up, getting arrested (by the bounty hunter). The week before that, is when they shot the office up (E09). This episode showed clips of that during the intro, so it doesnt seem like there was anything in between. If there was, believe me, I'd be all over it, cuz I'd hate to miss one :)"
[T],xgimpyx,2012-08-16T07:22Z,"Thanks twijjit for putting this ep up. I was having major power issues in the area the night it aired and couldn't cap it. Anyway just to clear up a couple things from the comments posted. This ep 10x10 is actually titled ""The Gypsy Hunter"" and 10x09 was ""Revenge"" because of all the issues with numbering. ""Doggin and Draggin"" was ep 10x07. The newest ep 10x11 is ""Gypsy Barbeque"". I hope this helps everyone with this very confusing season numbering and thanks again for posting this. :)"
,twijjit,2012-08-16T08:20Z,"I was glad to help, though all I did is grab it from one place and put it up here. :) Hope ya had better luck this week! New one aired tonight, and I'm not lookin forward to diggin through those sites again :)"
,twijjit,2012-08-16T08:23Z,"Oops, I completely forgot I put 'Revenge' in the title. Yeah, thats my fuckup. At the time, that was the only reference I could find for S10E10."
