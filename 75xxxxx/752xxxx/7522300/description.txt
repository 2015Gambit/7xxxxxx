QC 44 - Periodic Elements

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

Covering Atomic Shells, orbital sizes a definitive model of atomic nuclei shell structure is developed.

An exploded model of the elemental atomic nuclei is revealed for the first time to provide a basis for the aufbau process.

The forty -fourth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
