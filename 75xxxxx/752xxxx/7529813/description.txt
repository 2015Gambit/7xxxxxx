While there is nothing that really jumps off Wait for Night that makes it stick in your mind, it is still quite a nice record. Of course, the addition of Elton John's rhythm section and Jimmy Haskell's string work contributes to the album's overall quality. ~ Jim Worbois Personnel: Rick Springfield (guitar, piano, bass guitar, background vocals); Jimmie Haskell (strings); Bill Cuomo, Gabriel Katona (keyboards); Dee Murray (bass guitar, background vocals); Joe Lamano (bass guitar); Nigel Olsson (drums, background vocals); Jim Haas, Les Emerson (background vocals).
