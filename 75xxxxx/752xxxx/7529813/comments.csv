,cfmoran,2012-08-23T12:22Z,Thanks for this!  I used to have it on cassette.  This is the first I've seen the album even mentioned in years.

I lost my old vinyl collection years ago and have never been able to find Wait For Night, Comic Book Heroes and Beautiful Feelings anywhere.
Two out of three ain't bad today.

(I wish there were more seeders though... if it downloads, I'll seed it for a while)"
