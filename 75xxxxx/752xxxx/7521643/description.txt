The 1st Vaccines album is great because it feels like it takes 20 minutes to end.

That's how I think all power-pop-rock albums should be. 

But, on their second album, Come Of Age, I think they tried to refine their songs and ended putting things that just made the whole record sound lazy, even bad and boring.

So I made my own custom edit for all songs cutting all the crap and making the album sound more exiting. 

This is a no fat, 100%red meat and straight to the point version of the album. 

Go for it, it sounds and feels better. 

Lonely World was taken off completely, you won't miss it. 

Enjoy!
