PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS YOU OWN A LEGAL RETAIL COPY OF THIS GAME

PLEASE DISREGARD/IGNORE ANYTHING THAT GETS YOU TO GO TO THE ROCKSTARMODS WEBSITE. THEY DO NOT HAVE FULL SUPPORT FOR THIS MOD MENU SINCE ONLY A SMALL PART OF IT IS ACTUALLY FROM THAT WEBSITE.

PLEASE REFER TO OUR SITE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, NEED UPDATES OR ANYTHING ELSE RELATING TO OUR v3.0;We are working to update the text in the mod menu soon!
-----------------------------------------------------------

This has all the new 3.0 mods u can download from there site, plus optional airport AUTO car spawns (go to airport alone all cars will show up now no need to spawn one by one !)

and more map mods implemented already injected into ISO , just burn and done, 
same as the one u will get from there site right now 

this is the MOD FILE downloads implemented into the iso 
not the purchased mod disc , like the last upload
only difference is freeze cars and such not a big deal

so all files have been implemented, all u do is READ INSTRUCTION included in folder and burn to disc and hotswap thats it!

PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FOLDER OR U WILL FREEZE OR ERROR 
PLEASE DONT COMMENT DUMB STUFF I HAVE VERIFIED AND INSTALLED 

mod controls in there, and remember theres a mod slot 2 under more mods for object spawner 

more info or u want to learn to do it urself 
(u can edit files ur self and add different color headlights and such if u learn ur self!)
