,atndigcrk,2012-08-12T20:56Z,"nvm it actually has a freeze car lol
if u spawn Romeos car u freeze the game and player 
some others do this too jus play ard
ENJOY !"
,atndigcrk,2012-08-12T20:58Z,!!! INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN CHANGED - READ BEFORE U BURN _ DO NOT JUST BURN IT !!!
,atndigcrk,2012-08-12T21:09Z,"My own changes:
added 3.0 script mods 
added rainbow skid marks
all cars auto spawned at airport
new map mods auto spawn 
plus 10 more super new features

its still being developed so dont get mad if freezes or crashes a little more then 2.0 , 

TIP :
because these have auto spawners installed by me u cant spawn as much stuff as 2.0 or u will freeze, 
many factors, location, number of mods running, number of players

u can cut down on freezing when modding by rejoining games and exiting out of menu before modding other stuff "

,HipHopNYC,2012-08-24T17:34Z,"FAKE! This got me suspended for a week on live!!!! -_-

Just popped in the GTA disk, installed and hotswapped and all, started the game, 20 minutes later I get suspended. FUCK THIS! If you really want mods get PC, its easier and better.. or buy them for xbox from a trusted modder (if you have the money...)"
,atndigcrk,2012-08-24T19:51Z,"LMAO!!!
best troll ever 
this isnt a xbox mod u idiot its a hotswap soft mod  
pc? hahaha troll somewhere else"
,rockhardnips1,2012-08-26T03:12Z," Thanks for the upload downloaded it,burned it and it works well all the mods are cool but it freezes like every 20 minutes even if i don`t use the scripts burned it twice still the same problem, just wondering if there`s anyway to fix it or if anyone else is having the same problem."
,blindbeast,2012-08-26T04:48Z,how come it doesnt have common.rpf?
,atndigcrk,2012-08-26T22:39Z,"like i said its still underdevelopment
i freeze if i open too many mods
and nowadays every room has 2-3 modders lol
that all effects it "
,atndigcrk,2012-08-27T02:59Z,"last comment here, 28 likes , 50 downloads a day , over 1500 downloads so far, and no comments how great it is, only wierd poo comments, lol 

guess its bc there too busy playing the game to come back here

if u know ur gonna freeze w.e ur doing in 20 min why dont u just rejoin the game like i said , exit and then go to friends and go to last tab and find the recent players and rejoin session

or do what i do and never play in a big room with many people , never freezes for me then 

anyways enjoy guys fast download still thx seeders

,rockhardnips1,2012-09-01T21:23Z,Ok i figured out why i was getting kicked out every 20 mins. the evades mod has something messed up with it when you put all weapons and armor on fo some reason you get laged out much more often. so just dont put all weapons and armor on and you can play for alot longer.
,atndigcrk,2012-09-04T23:27Z,NEW STABLE VERSION WITH LESS AUTO SPAWNS COMING SOON 
,Markagain,2012-09-05T00:29Z,"Any chance of a pal version? I tried to patch the a pal iso but when I mount it on daemon tools it shows it as a dvd? Should I use a diff program to mount? Also what folder are the mods in on this share? the ones I transfer to pal iso, thanks."

,atndigcrk,2012-09-05T03:15Z,"@rock ...i think ur using the evade menu for that , instead go to extra mods and use the keyboard version , the mod control in there, much more stable "

,badass1215,2012-09-11T07:17Z,this works perfect make sure u clear system cache and make new gta save starting at romans place
,badass1215,2012-09-12T21:11Z,try this exact same plus tons more and nohotswap way easy
,badass1215,2012-09-12T21:20Z,"this works perfect haven froze in like a month i spawnn 200 thousand cars in a lobby full of modders i didnt even freeze i used this one though

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7621687/evade_3.0__deadly_fishes_3.0_and_6_mod_menus__(NO_HOTSWAP)_USB_O

it is the same thing only this one is finished with tons more shit in it and no lags or freezez"
,atndigcrk,2012-09-14T10:15Z,"my method works 100 percent...
and actually downloads ...

http://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/"
,atndigcrk,2012-09-14T10:21Z,"..btw if u use script mods u eventually freeze , theres no way in hell u never freeze no matter how many mods u open , the reason the game and everyone sees it is because ur scripts are going to a server side ,

 if u have auto spawns like these mods have (cars show up autmatically and map mods appear auto,) then eventually adding those to more mods u open will eventually freeze, dont believe other wise...

these mods arent meant for auto spawners i added those so eventually people keep opening mods , then it freezes, but if ur in a small game u never do , scripts on server plus a full game - ull freeze soon, dont believe any mess like script mods plus never freeze for a month lmao..

ill upload a 3.0 without the auto spawners soon , but i really enjoy these ones i custom made plus the eta for download is under 1 HOUR!

enjoy 
http://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/"
,atndigcrk,2012-09-14T10:33Z,"...and thats how those freeze cars work , if anyone wanted to know, 

normal players have normal scripts that the server reads everyone has a number and a slot on the server, when u over load ur player wit 40 mods or alot of mods in a short amount of time u will freeze...

thus the ""freeze car"" fills up the other plays slots full of bogus scripts till they all freeze, and in my research ive never seen script mods be writting onto a real gta disc without the hotswap method, maybe usb is for modded xboxs or something but i never heard of em
