Royal Albert Hall
London, UK

Audio Ripped from the DVD release.  They did not release
a CD of this show.  It's a great SBD/AUD mix.

*** THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL "COVER/TRIBUTE" BAND! ***
THE MUSIC WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF.  IF YOU HAVE THEY COME 
TO A CITY NEAR YOU, IT'S A "MUST SEE".  I'VE SEEN OVER 
300+ CONCERTS AND HUNDREDS OF BANDS (INCLUDING PINK FLOYD 
AND ROGER WATERS), AND THIS BAND'S SHOWS ARE SOME OF THE 
TOPS ON MY LIST. ***

DO NOT SELL!  DO NOT SELL!  DO NOT SELL!

From www.aussiefloyd.com :  Having sold over three million tickets in concerts that have taken place in 35 countries, The Australian Pink Floyd Show is rightfully hailed as one of the most in demand touring entities currently operating, The Times described them as ΓÇ£The Gold StandardΓÇ¥.  This act is so good they were even engaged by David Gilmour to perform at his 50th birthday celebration! 

During an eveningΓÇÖs festivities at the Fulham Town Hall, performing Pink Floyd to the members of Pink Floyd amongst others. Toward the end of the performance Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt joined the band on stage alongwith Rick Wright for a rendition of 'Comfortably Numb'. This was followed by David Gilmour, Gary Wallis, Tim Renwick and Claudia Fontaine along with Guy and Rick, performing a number of edited versions of Floyd songs including 'Money' and 'What Do You Want From Me'. It was an incredible ending to an unbelievable night.
