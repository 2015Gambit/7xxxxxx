Thank you so much for taking the time to upload this.  I always seed, for a long time, so will be returning the favor, thanks again! +1 on quality."
,friendly_donkey,2012-08-13T16:58Z,Is this for real?
,metou,2012-08-13T17:03Z,Is it censored or not?
,hulivar,2012-08-13T17:35Z,the first comment just seems a little contrived lolz....Unfortunately I have to rely on comments because I don't want to update my utorrent due to technical issues so I cannot check/see what I'm downloading on magnet links...wonder if a lot of utorrrent 2.2.1 users have this problem
,Kilroy222,2012-08-13T18:09Z,"It's real. However, it's not widescreen and extremely low-res. Wat for a better copy..."
,Kilroy222,2012-08-13T18:10Z,And it IS censored. 
,Kilroy222,2012-08-13T18:12Z,Thanks for deleting my comments douchebag! Continue to put your crap up.
,injectr,2012-08-13T18:25Z,"Its 4:3  The video is a big grainy. A/V=9/8

Not complaining, just letting y'all know.  Thanks for uploading.  I will still be watching it."
,keenh,2012-08-13T19:53Z,"Seeing as this is the only copy I've found so far, even on the big torrent sites, then big ups to the uploader. I wanna see it, I don't care if the picture is bad, as long as I can still hear the jokes. lol"
,xpmule,2012-08-13T19:56Z,"hulivar
thats how they work.. for everyone
i'm using 2.2.1 also and i have to wait until the hash has been looked up and then the file list gets populated etc
If you think about it for second there is no other way they could work, it makes sense it happens that way.."
,DTake2012,2012-08-13T20:03Z,Uncensored won't come on TPB until it airs during Comedy Central's Secret Stash.
,WuzzlePopple,2012-08-13T22:11Z,"Um...no my comment is not contrived, I'm just not picky on something I will only watch once. The comment was directed to the uploader and not used for recommendation purposes, you dope."
,calvoce,2012-08-13T22:54Z,Thank you ZeroAccend.
,ZeroAccend,2012-08-13T23:14Z,"Yes, this is censored. It's a rip straight from comedy central.
I've heard no word of an uncensored version of this coming out yet but to my knowledge, as of this post, there's no uncensored version available.

Kilroy222, I'm not sure what comment you're talking about getting deleted. Obviously you're not a contributor to the torrent community or you'd know you can't delete comments on TPB thread. Once they're posted, they're posted. Try hitting the refresh button.

If you think this torrent is crap then don't watch it and go find a better copy somewhere else. Or, better yet, get a better copy yourself, encode it, and upload it."
,metou,2012-08-13T23:47Z,DTake2012 Can I ask you when is that going to be? (I'm not american)
,rubyredrage,2012-08-14T02:22Z,Thanks for the upload! Quality isn't 100% but it is the only copy available right now.
,Dwjr1981,2012-08-14T02:36Z,Thank you so much for uploading this. I had set my DVR to record so I wouldn't miss this but somehow the last few minutes during her 'roast back' got cut off...lol. Now I get to see the end!
,bryentheartist,2012-08-14T03:32Z,thank you soooo much some of us appreciate all the work done to UL on here :)
,ZeroAccend,2012-08-14T05:29Z,"To everyone saying ""thank you"", you're welcome.

Like I said, I know this isn't the best quality but it's far from unwatchable and the best I have available.

I would like to note that this is NOT my encode. I grabbed this from some obscure torrent site I've never heard of when I was searching for it myself earlier. Then I uploaded it to TPB b/c I know how many people use this site.

Enjoy and seed it up :)"
,6311,2012-08-14T05:53Z,"Poor image quality
Bad sound quality"
,Psythik,2012-08-14T07:58Z,Is this HD? For the file size it better be.
,6311,2012-08-14T08:45Z,"SD
 horror

"
,Psythik,2012-08-14T10:33Z,"V: 3
A: 9

It's watchable, but it is letterboxed 4:3 and was ripped from an analog stream. I'd say it's about VHS quality. Better than nothing."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-08-14T15:57Z,Much obliged.
,DTake2012,2012-08-14T17:18Z,"@metou - I think it's usually the weekend after the original airdate at 1am on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. 

Maybe 2 weeks after the original airdate."
,RayFinkle25,2012-08-14T22:32Z,"Kilroy222, stop being such a whiny bitch. It's not widescreen...so fucking cry about it. And complaining about it being censored? OF COURSE IT'S CENSORED. It's the version that was aired on TV. At least someone uploaded it. Douche. "
,davejoy2,2012-08-15T18:08Z,Thank you:)
,ghostb25,2012-08-15T18:44Z,they cut A LOT of jokes...
