Animations and interactive content created with MotionComposer for Mac runs on any computer, smartphone, and tablet, including iPhone, iPad, and Android.

MotionComposerΓÇÖs unique technology plays interactive content as Flash┬« in Web browsers that support Flash, and automatically plays a HTML5 version in browsers that donΓÇÖt support Flash. Now your interactive Web content will play in any browser, including iPhone and iPad!

WHAT'S NEW

ΓÇóHTML5 animation engine has been completely rewritten to provide compatibility with all the latest browsers.
ΓÇóBanners, animations, and interactive components made with the new MotionComposer will be compatible with the last generation of web browsers that support HTML5 technology (like Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer 9), in addition to the existing iPhone/iPad and Safari compatibility.
ΓÇóWe want to grant you priority access to the beta version for you to test on your existing animations, and get your comments and recommendations. The upgrade will be free to you.
