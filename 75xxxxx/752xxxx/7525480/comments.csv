I don't just have to retext, as originally planned, because the old english translation had so many errors (like consistently misspelling Claudia's last name in book 2 for example), that I have had to use google translate and check, and possibly retranslate, about every 3rd bubble in the books....that slows it down quite a bit.
And at the moment, I had the Valhallas and Canardos that i just posted, that had to get out first, and got 4 scanlations to proofread for JJ, then I can get back to Click :)"
,txen,2012-09-15T23:56Z,Thanks for Click 1 & 2 ;-) Is the Butterscotch series also coming out?
