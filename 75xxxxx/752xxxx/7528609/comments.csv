,Al-Andalus,2012-08-14T09:45Z,"That I would like to know, why not seeding correctly. I'm sick of reading support forums are attempting to configure the qBittorrent, but nothing, no seeds.
I think all the steps correct: I set the torrent file, adding trackers, I leave my computer running 24 hours a day, I have open ports on the router, removed the firewall ... What else should I do?
Too bad, because I have a lot of interesting stuff I want to share. But I see around here is impossible. I have to use alternative methods. Sorry"
,uradumfuk,2012-08-14T16:26Z,"you've trued to post approximately 160 torrents in 2 weeks. TOO MUCH, TOO SOON. I would STOP them all in your bittorrent client, then just start the oldest 8-10, let them seed until they are properly seeded. Then, stop them and then start the next 8-10. Just 8-10 at a time, not 160. You don't have the bandwidth to up 160 torrents at one time !"
