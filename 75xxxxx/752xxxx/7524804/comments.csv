,WolfPunk,2012-09-02T15:34Z,"Listen, you sniveling sycophants, he chose to upload it.  A man's taste reflects his character. And ChattChitto, you spineless coward,  how typical of you to wait for your ass-kissing fans (fanatics) to fight your battles.  You talking about brains is akin to your silly ASCII skull talking about flesh.  Keep up the grovelling flunkies, and the 'great man'  may really, really like you."
