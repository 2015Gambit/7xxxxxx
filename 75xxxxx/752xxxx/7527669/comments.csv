The cut is NOT in the 720p version or any recodes therefrom. Now you can tell who's doing what ..."
,nursemorph,2012-08-13T11:09Z,"Thanks ettv.

@pc-Gnome: It's entirely possible no-one will do a re-encode/repack given that the cut only misses out 3 words. Annoying yes but tolerable"
,Repotsbog,2012-08-13T19:17Z,"pc gnome beat me to the punch on the skip, was just going to mention it to anyone who would be downloading this. Didn't even try checking the other version this guy posted so maybe that one is legit? But then again, ettv it just a filler for me until either eztv or VTV upload their versions."
,folderol1,2012-08-14T01:34Z,VTV's repack does not have the glitch with Charlie in the library.
