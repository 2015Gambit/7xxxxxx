Great upload! You will change my mind about BMX soon.

Whatever, would you be kind eough to upload Cycling Xcounty Women Final (Yesterday) and Cycling Xcountry Men Final (which is currently running right now).

I use to watch it on French National TV, it sucks damn well and waste the good old sport since incessant cut from retard speacker, adds, handbal, adds, nationnal lottery, retard speacker, and so on, making me think about taxe-money-waste, birth-policy, god, and so on instead of good old sport.

Only you display pure olympics display - and you should be very proud. 

You and consistent green skull related of yours are the only real old good public service!!! 

Please Remember : Cycling Xcounty Women Final (Yesterday) and Cycling Xcountry Men Final (Currently)"
