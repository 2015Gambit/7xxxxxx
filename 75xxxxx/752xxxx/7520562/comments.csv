He will never finish his torrents, even if you see a few seeders.
Try to check his uploads - they all show zero or a few seeders and more than 100 leechers, which is not normal.
He just want you to check his screenshot, so he can get some $ 
DO NOT click on the image link! "
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-08-11T02:30Z,"@tch321: I can confirm that this post:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7512001/%5BUncensored_HD720p%5D_1pondo_080712_400_Drama_collection__Yuwa_Tok

was seeded to completion, because I just finished getting it.  

So before you continue with your trolling campaign, you might want to check out a recent post or two yourself.  Maybe janesteve has changed his seeding policy but you haven't bothered to do anything except complain."

You're right that this torrent was seeded.
It happens now and then, but if you check:

http://thepiratebay.se/user/janesteve/

you will see that from yesterday to now, there are 6 torrents which I do not
think ever will be completed."
