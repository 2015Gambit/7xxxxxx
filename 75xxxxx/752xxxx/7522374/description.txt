QC 57 - Compounds

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The formation of compound molecules through the bonding of elemental Tetryonic geometries is explained.

Numerous examples of compound moelcules are provided to demonstrate Tetryonic bonding of elements into compound molecules.

The fifty-seventh chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
