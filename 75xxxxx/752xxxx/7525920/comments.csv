Again, you don't need to buy the game in order to play. You just need FREE (non-premium) account."

,eyereign,2012-08-12T17:20Z,A job well done again FEarBG!  Am downloading now.  Will test tomorrow and give some feedback.  Thanks for the effort on your side.  This means a lot to me!
,hecrapan,2012-08-14T06:11Z,Simply amazing. That's the only thing i can say about this torrent.
,SoYman,2012-08-17T05:26Z,"WOW! i cannot express my gratitude.

it works perfect!"
,aqdv25,2012-08-18T16:39Z,I can't watch the video that you posted.. any help?
,aqdv25,2012-08-18T16:40Z,I have difficulty installing.. the game opens but with no mods or texture packs..
,aqdv25,2012-08-18T16:51Z,last thing.. can you install texture packs?
,FEarBG,2012-08-19T09:45Z,"@aqdv25

About the video, just YouTube search ""Minecraft 1.2.5 with Technic Pack [FEarBG]"". You will not see anything special anyway. The installation is pretty simple..

About the mods, you are doing something wrong. I do not even know how to help you with that. Just reinstall and try again...

You can add new texture packages, but you need to find the root folder for the packages that you want to improve. I will give you a simple patch : C:/Users/You User Name/AppData/Roaming/.techniclauncher/technicssp/texturepacks

This is for Windows 7 and as you can see is aimed at the Technic SSP pack .."
,oorenotsoo,2012-08-19T17:48Z,"Thanks for sharing FEarGB. The YouTube video was a nice touch.

Will this work with future Minecraft and/or Tekkit updates?"
,FEarBG,2012-08-19T18:57Z,"@oorenotsoo

Yes, but only if you register free Minecraft account and login with it. When there is a new update you will see pop-up window that asks if you want to download it or not. After that everything is automatic.."
,oorenotsoo,2012-08-19T19:49Z,"@FEarBG

Thanks for the speedy reply. I just finished playing a bit after downloading this. I made a free Minecraft account, as per the instructions, and it asked me about updating immediately. It also asked something about ""loose settings"" but I just had it ignore that. The install and setup were very easy. Thanks again for sharing!"
,FEarBG,2012-08-21T19:00Z,"Recently I started getting a few comments under my videos about problems with mods and my torrents in general.

Since YouTube is not the most appropriate site for such discussions, nor ThePirateBay, I made a small forum where everyone can create a thread about his problem.

Please post any problems there and leave only suggestions or simple questions as comments on ThePirateBay or YouTube.

,SoYman,2012-09-12T01:01Z,"it would be cool if you pointed out how to change the mod. it took me a long time to figure out that it was not just bugged but a ""hidden"" drop-down menu."
,MrAssistance,2012-09-12T02:25Z,"Thanks for the great torrent!

I have a problem though:

My Minecraft crashes in Tekkit, claiming that I don't have enough memory or something of that sort. I have tried googling around for a solution, all though the .bat solution that many are using don't seem to be working for me. 

Is there someway to fix this? Thanks in advance"
,FEarBG,2012-09-12T09:51Z,"@SoYman

I'm sorry, but I do not think I understand what you mean. """"hidden"" drop-down menu"" ? 

I can not universally show you how to change / remove mods from here. It depends on how they are installed, to what extent are integrated with the game, etc. 

If you want to remove a certain mod, make a topic in my forum and I'll tell you exactly how.

@MrAssistance

*.bat files allow you to run the game with certain settings. For example - allows the game to use less or more RAM, depending on what you want.

Anyway the ""Technic Pack"" launcher have this option inside him. Take a look at this picture :

,bryk,2012-09-13T14:18Z,"A big thank you to the uploader for this. After struggling for two days with crappy downloads from other sites, trying to add the mods myself and ending up with errors, this one finally works!"
,xdaxcaptainx,2012-09-17T01:06Z,"the option to play offline doesn't seem to work with me. ive got the correct java, and this pc hasn't been connected to the net in a year or so, so its not that. 

anyone have any advice?"
,FEarBG,2012-09-17T16:32Z,"@xdaxcaptainx

I apologize for that. It's my mistake..

It seems that you must at least once connect the launcher to minecraft net with FREE account in order to be able to play offline after. If you don't (or don't have internet connection on this device) the launcher will lock you out and you won't be able to play.

A single login in minecraft net creates a file that is needed for the launcher to run the game without which otherwise can not pass.

So long story short : You need internet connection to login once in minecraft net and then you can play ""offline"" forever (without any internet)."
