YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY THE GAME TO PLAY Technic Pack!!! You just need FREE account inI repeat, Technic Pack work with non-premium account.

If you really do not want to register or have a problem with this, just stop your internet connection before you start the Technic Pack and then click "Offline Mode". Work the same way as if you are registered, but you will not receive updates on new packages.


Install JAVA 7 : http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

I made a small change in the main Technic Pack launcher and now it will not let you play unless you have Java 7.
