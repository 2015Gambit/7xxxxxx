,mentallyours,2012-08-12T12:29Z,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jacksonville Jaguars' starting unit faded after a fast start. The New York Giants were the opposite, scoring on four consecutive series after being stopped on their opening drive.

Eli Manning only played two series and produced three points, and backup quarterback David Carr was impressive with a pair of second-quarter touchdown passes, but the Jaguars used an 18-point second-half to squeak out a 32-31 win over the visiting Giants in the preseason opener for both teams"
