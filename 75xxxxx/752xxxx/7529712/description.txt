    Helen and Madeline hate each other. Madeline is married to Ernest, who is
    having an affair with Helen. Both women rely on Ernest for plastic surgery
    for their continued good looks, so when Madeline finds a cure for ageing,
    Helen gets it too. It isn't until both become immortal that they realise
    that 'life' will never be the same again.
