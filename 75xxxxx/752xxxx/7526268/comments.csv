Verified now and seems that issue is only on Windows 7 x64. Anyway ,I have a new update patch with Drunk Camera fix here : http://www.nosteam.ro/index.php?topic=186.msg2236#msg2236

Install that patch and all will be normal."
,nikman520,2012-08-20T21:08Z,Ok I will check the patch thank you.
,nikman520,2012-08-21T11:08Z,Sorry radurall but it doesn't work. The camera stills bombing.

Are you sure you have installed that Drunk Camera patch in your game folder?? not just copy patch there - install it"
,nikman520,2012-08-21T12:15Z,I will re-install and I will tell you later.
,nikman520,2012-08-21T12:44Z,"Fail torrent man. We cannot type cheats, Camera is bombing and I cannot play multiplayer. I deleted this game. But don't worry still you have the best torrents."

I have tested on Win7 x64 ,Win XP x64 Win XPx32 - working well both multiplayer and no Drunk Camera. If you cannot play multiplayer neither is something wrong on your PC. "
,nikman520,2012-08-21T19:37Z,Look I am not alone. There are other guys who have the same problem.
