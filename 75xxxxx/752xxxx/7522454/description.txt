REO Speedwagon (originally spelled R.E.O. Speedwagon) is an American rock band. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold. Over the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones "Keep On Loving You" and "Can't Fight This Feeling". REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity had dissipated by the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.

Hi Infidelity is the ninth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1980 (see 1980 in music). It went on to become the biggest selling rock LP of 1981, eventually selling over ten million copies. Six songs from this album hit Billboard charts, including "Keep on Loving You" which was the band's first Number 1 hit, and "Take It on the Run", which reached No. 5 on the charts.

In October 2004, the band recorded the songs of this album live from beginning to end for an XM Radio "Then Again Live" special.

On July 21, 2011, Sony Music rereleased Hi Infidelity with Bonus Demo tracks for the album's 30th anniversary.
