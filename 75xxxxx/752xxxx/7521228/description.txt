The Fixx - Built for the Future [promo].VOB


HQ very rare promo music video. "Built for the Future" is a song from Walkabout (#30 US, #26 CAN), the fourth studio album by British new wave band The Fixx, released in 1986. First single "Secret Separation" spent two weeks atop the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart to become the band's second #1 single on this chart in July 1986.

The Fixx is an English rock band formed in London in 1979. Their hits include "One Thing Leads to Another," "Red Skies," "Stand or Fall," "Saved by Zero," "Sign of Fire," "Are We Ourselves?," "Secret Separation," "Driven Out," "How Much Is Enough?," and "Deeper and Deeper," which was featured on the soundtrack of Streets of Fire.

They are one of the few bands to have enjoyed significant success outside their country of origin, notably in the United States and Canada, yet remain almost unknown in their home land. The band is best known for their song "One Thing Leads to Another", from their most successful album Reach the Beach in 1983.

Long-time bassist Dan K. Brown re-joined the band in 2008. The Fixx regularly tour the U.S., and recently celebrated 25 years of making music together, accompanied by the release of the 2 CD set Twentyfifth Anniversary Anthology compilation.

With the classic lineup back intact, The Fixx have just released their 10th studio album "Beautiful Friction" on July 17, 2012.
