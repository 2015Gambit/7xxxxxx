,Soulketcher,2012-08-11T08:30Z,"I think the reason you are getting some criticism from other users is simply due to a lack of clarity in describing the exact nature of this Win 8 Torrent.

Lack of a KMS activation until servers are up again, so these among a few other things, have simply ""turned me off"" to the final build .. a few revisions will be made, the inability to circumvent the ""Win 8 GUI - Formerly Known as ""Metro""  has just tipped the scales to the """"meh"" side of win 8 over win 7.
