http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398373/"
,cujimmmy,2012-08-13T22:18Z,"And what are you @oak415 ? if not a leech also!
Everyone has a right to make constructive comments maybe without the swearing but The TV Team never leave their own info and are best avoided. AS soon as i see tv team on a torrent I get it elsewhere from better uploaders that appreciate their customers by leaving Good Info. "
,Dlurker,2012-08-14T00:52Z,"omg this day's leech is an overuse word o.O

come on learn the meaning of the word ""leech"": a fucker who doesn't seed back the file he download.

Btw it will be nice if TvTeam can add real info
like the audio(dub or sub),  etc. this kind of info can't be find on imdb o.O
