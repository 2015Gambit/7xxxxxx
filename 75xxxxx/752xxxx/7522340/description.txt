QC 51 - Elemental Atoms

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The final, correct quantum model of elemental atoms is revealed.
Atomic numbers, elemental masses, ionisation energies and spectral lines can now all be modelled with one geometric 3D model.

The fifty-first chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
