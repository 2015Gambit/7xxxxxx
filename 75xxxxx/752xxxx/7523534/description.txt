What drove a company of American soldiers -- ordinary young men from around the country -- to commit the worst atrocity in American military history? Were they ΓÇ£just following ordersΓÇ¥ as some later declared? Or, did they break under the pressure of a vicious war in which the line between enemy soldier and civilian had been intentionally blurred? AMERICAN EXPERIENCE focuses on the 1968 My Lai massacre, its subsequent cover-up, and the heroic efforts of the soldiers who broke ranks to try to halt the atrocities, and then bring them to light.
