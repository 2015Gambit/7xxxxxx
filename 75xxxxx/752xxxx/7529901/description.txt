EAC/WAV FLACS of a September 1958 recording ripped from a

remastered CD first released in 1991

If you're into the JAZZTET you'll love this since Golson and Farmer co-led the 

jazztet


Great Horn harmonies to be heard here...Benny Golson is a gifted writer and arranger

A nice gig for Bill Evans who was still largely unknown at the time
