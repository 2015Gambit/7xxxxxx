[V],LegendET,2012-08-11T11:01Z,thanks 
[T],trialNerror,2012-08-11T11:21Z,"no american guns 2x13

was away on vacation this week that's why i didn't upload anything

no meteorite men either. could keep an eye out for repeats of it on tv if they ever pop up on the schedule. they're not showing any time soon from what i can tell. all 3 seasons tho?  jeez mageez. that's gonna take a long time to collect.  i'm still waiting on just 1 freakin ep of ghost adventures from season 4 so i can upload that full 720p season. been waiting about a year now... so... yea... just to give you an idea just how long a long time can be"
,xiaoecho2,2012-08-11T12:12Z,thanx for sharing
[V],psspss,2012-08-11T12:29Z,"OK'

all 3 seasons of meteorite men does exist on usenet in 4gb per episodes.. uploaded as ts.. im surprised
noone has 720p them at least to 1gb
costly of data for news groups to get the set though

i think only 3 episodes were capped by scene ever.. in S01 but the series got better after s01 I hear.. less bragging about the 100K per rock they found :l"
[V],psspss,2012-08-11T12:38Z,think some hit and run as theres liek 30 stuck at 99 percent :/
[V],psspss,2012-08-11T12:44Z,ok seems to be going again now
