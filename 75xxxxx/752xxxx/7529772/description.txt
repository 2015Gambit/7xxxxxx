Springfield grew considerably as a writer between his first record and Comic Book Heroes. Although he is still doing some sensitive singer/songwriter material, it no longer sounds as awkward. In fact, a couple tracks, like "Weep No More," are very memorable. On the other hand, "Misty Water Woman" sounds like an overly-melodramatic attempt at being Elton John. Still, the good stuff makes it worth owning. ~ Jim Worbois Includes liner notes by Ken Sharp. All songs written by Rick Springfield. Recorded at Morgan Studios, London, England.
