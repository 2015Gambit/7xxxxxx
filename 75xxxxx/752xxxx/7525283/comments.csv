[V],psspss,2012-08-13T04:14Z,"plays fine here

suspect you need to do some pc maintenance

often what happens is the directory you download
to has some fat damage.. run scandisk on c: AND DOWNLOAD LOCATION

then go backto utorrent.. right click and say force recheck it will see what chunks are missing

also antip2p will seed bad chunks and can fool some older clients that you have it when you dont

so why you need to install peer block 1.1"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T04:15Z,also try the new 2.04 beta vlc I added a few weeks ago i like it as the blue var is easier to see how far along its played so far instead of the small same color knob moving along
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T10:41Z,"plays just fine for me on vlc.as for the beta it crashes on me everytime I try to play a mkv or flv.idk,maybe it doesn't like things that end in v ;)"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T13:16Z,"nope the 2.04 beta plays mkvs and ts fine on my win 7

depends what beta you tried... 2.1 is not as good"

,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-13T14:28Z,"I just checked & your rite,it was 2.0.1.I still had the installer on my hard drive....until now anyway.I'll check out the other one"
[V],psspss,2012-08-13T15:11Z,"vlc 1.11.1 was the best one.. but had the old interface

what I do is install that one and rename the
install folder to 1.11 on end

and then install the beta 2.04 as per normal

then you can drop back to the true test alpha one if have any problems

just make a shortcut to it etc"
