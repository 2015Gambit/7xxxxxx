Po-po don't fuck around
As the camera take pictures of us
We just laugh, we laugh

Because they can't stop this
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel it in our, we can feel it in our
The future's ours, yes it is
We can feel it in our bones 

We drop the lighter
Into the gas
If the whole world is watching us
Let them watch, Let them watch

Because they can't stop this
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel it in our, we can feel it in our
The future's ours Yes it is
We can feel it in our bones 
We can feel it in our, We can feel it in our bones 

Because they can't stop this
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel it in our, we can feel it in
The future's ours, yes it is
We can feel it in our bones 
We can feel it in our, We can feel it in our bones "
