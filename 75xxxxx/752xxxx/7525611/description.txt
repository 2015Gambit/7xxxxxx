A Year in the Wild
The breathtaking landscapes and spectacular wildlife of some of Britain's most iconic National Parks, seen through the eyes of people who know them best, Hermione Norris purrs narration over enchanting images of the crags and valleys of the National Parks. The film takes a dim view of the tourists who flock to the area, but sorry, programmes like this will only encourage us.




2)  The New Forest 
A portrait of the ancient landscapes and spectacular wildlife of the New Forest National Park, seen through the eyes of the people who know it best. The New Forest is a fragment of the ancient wild wood that once stretched the length and breadth of Europe - it is also one of Britain's newest National Parks. This enchanted forest is like no other: pigs and ponies roam beneath mighty oaks and beeches, and pockets of heath land shelter some of the rarest creatures in Britain - including Dartford warblers, hobbies and sand lizards. People live here too - with a unique lifestyle that has survived since medieval times. This film follows a forest keeper, a coppicer, a storyteller and a farmer as the seasons change, revealing the secrets of an exquisite forest that's as old as England.
