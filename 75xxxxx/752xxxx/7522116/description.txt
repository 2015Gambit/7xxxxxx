The Jerry Garcia Band's Fall 1991 East Coast tour is fondly remembered 
as one of the band's peak moments, a run of shows brimming with energy, 
wit and heart. The Hampton show was particularly enlivened by Bruce Hornsby, 
who sat in the entire night on electric piano.

The Hampton set list is classic late-period JGB, including several newly 
introduced tunes. Brand-new to the repertoire on this tour were "Ain't No 
Bread in the Breadbox" (Norton Buffalo), the Manhattan's 1980 soul hit 
"Shining Star", and Van Morrison's "Bright Side of the Road". Another Van 
Morrison song, "He Ain't Give You None" was also played, having been unearthed 
in 1991 from the Garcia-Saunders Band's early 70s songbook. Chuck Berry's 
"You Never Can Tell" made its East Coast debut on the tour: be prepared for 
a rave-up when Jerry and Bruce trade ripping solos and ascend rock 'n' roll 
Olympus.

The highlight of the show may have been a special new encore: the magnificent 
"What A Wonderful World," originally recorded by Louis Armstrong in 1967. 
Played by the Jerry Garcia Band only ten times, and always as an encore, "What 
A Wonderful World" became an instant audience favorite. Jerry seems to draw 
in his performance from the same spirit of benevolence and grace from which 
Satch drew on his memorable track.
