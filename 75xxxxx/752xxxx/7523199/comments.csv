,CHAOS1972,2012-08-16T23:27Z,"Thanks
Works so far.
Updated fine after install.

,tezza008,2012-08-18T11:14Z,They've stopped this one from updating any more
,CHAOS1972,2012-08-23T21:18Z,"I just updated again and it worked fine.

I even checked the Avast site and my engine & definitions are all up to date."

,rid911,2012-08-24T09:17Z,works fine. the pop-ups have also stopped. thanks :)
,BrunoHerz,2012-08-24T14:01Z,Don't forget guys to put the full crack path into: Real Time Shields - File System Shield - Exclusions as C:Program FilesAVAST SoftwareAvastVersion.dll to prevent any possibility of it being rumbled. Also put the same exclusion into Settings - Exclusions to prevent the Boot Time scan from possibly picking it up as a reported prolem.

,transfact,2012-09-08T00:48Z,"Guys, I couldn't download from Official site, However, I went to www.softonic.com and I downloaded the AVAST Internet security version 7.0.1466 and this Fix still worked ! and My avast is now registered until 2050. But I will have to uninstall because the firewall and other stuff, like the SHIELD won't let me read my emails. So I will stick to a regular AVAST antivirus, I hope this fix will work once again."
,sprenger,2012-09-10T12:39Z,"Hi erverybody. How can I get rid of the ""popup"" which  is telling me that the subscrition is expired and the virus definitions not are going to update ?

The subscription is active until 14.03.2050
I've downloaded from softtonic.com
Thx for answering, if you know :-)"
,toyracer,2012-09-17T16:50Z,"I tried it on 17/9/2012 and it didn't work. avast remained free with the same 2013 expiration I had before. I followed the instructions exactly, and ensured that I logged into safe mode as administrator. The .dll file is where it is instructed to be, the xp registry file was added but avast remains in regular free mode."
