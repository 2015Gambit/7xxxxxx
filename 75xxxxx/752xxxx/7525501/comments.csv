,themanisyou,2012-08-12T14:56Z,The game works perfectly. Thanks !
[V],Sosowski,2012-08-13T13:21Z,"Yay! My game is here! As weird as it sounds I am actually excited about this.

Anyways, I am not any average video game company, I am just one man making games for a living, so feel free to give me all your money if you like the game! 

I get it that in some countries PayPal doesn't work, or the price might seem really high for some of you, so here are some gift codes for you:
028D-FEBA-1197
028D-FEBA-258F
028D-FEBA-2EBD
028D-FEBA-3515
028D-FEBA-3903

Most of all, enjoy the game, tell your friends about it, and throw some coins in my general direction if you like it!
All the best,
Sos"

I have a favour to ask of you! McPixel just landed on Steam Greenlight and it can get on Steam if it gets enough thumbs up!

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=91573598

Help me out and experience my eternal love and dryhumping! I'd really appreciate that!
Also, don't forget to give me Rupees, Coins, Gil's or whatever you have few spares of if you enjoy the game! I won't be buying Ferraris for CEOs for that! I'll be buying food and coffee to crunch on making more cool games for you to play! 

And here are few more gift codes so you don't forget I love you "

,samerdl,2012-09-07T18:52Z,"excuse me, but i must ask what is the purpose/goal in the game? 

i just pressed my mouse and i drank an entire pool, then blew up a plane XD "
,altund,2012-09-07T21:20Z,you sos is the only game maker i know who supports torrents. and that is because you make game for the joy and entertainment while other people make games for money. so you understand the true reason why games are made. LONG LIVE SOS!

,RickyTheFish,2012-09-08T11:48Z,"@samerdl: It is a point-and-click game in which you can interact with various items in each scene. Your goal is to prevent the explosion. Regardless of whether you win or lose, you progress to the next scene. The scenes play in a loop, skipping over previously-solved scenes until all of them have been solved."
,DwarfWalrus,2012-09-08T23:36Z,"The only reason I'm torrenting this is because my ""you paid for it here's the dl link"" email hasn't shown up :)"
,PLZdontJAILme,2012-09-09T00:00Z,"The game is hard and very fun, playing at 35 fps."
,jeremyey,2012-09-09T05:49Z,i'm i the only one here that find it funny that the person who made this game is ok with us pirating it
,proud_monkey,2012-09-09T12:32Z,"waaaa i only wish i could make online payments (no credit cards or such things where i live). if you can, do shoot some money that way. even if you don't particularly like this game we have to show people a pirate freindly bussiness model where people want and will pay.

point is by paying, sharing, and paying mostly. more autthors will want to distribute their work this way. 

think about it for a minute. its has to be worth a few $$. at least as an investement in the idea it self."
,chickenbath,2012-09-09T15:34Z,Thiis gaame.....is hella fkin Epic! i Love it xD great job upload and creator of game :)-/--
