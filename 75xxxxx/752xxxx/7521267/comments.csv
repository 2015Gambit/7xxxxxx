u r welcome and thanks for seeding !!!! cheers !!!!

I will tell u + of win 8 till now i observed
1. i dont have to reboot after installing display drivers for    my  crossfire notebook, it was not possible   with win 7
2.it installed in 10 min quite fast, booting and shut down is also quick
3. explorer is more responsive
4. task bar on my external 24 inch monitor, can be Customized as u wish separately
5..taken all my wifi drivers by default though i reduced driver folder (460 to 140 mb)
in win 7 if i install full os still it never taken wifi drivers by default.i have to install them manually.
DOWN side
1. aero is too ugly, cant change fonts , colour is too dirty, too much eye straining "
