The Chaser NoN-stop News Network was a fun show to watch at least twice, as the content was brilliant, and the scrolling news bar at the bottom was just as hilarious.

it did take some time to collect all of the episodes together, and I hope my fellow Australian torrenters assist in seeding this hilarious show.
