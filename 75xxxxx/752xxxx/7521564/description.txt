The Secret Life of the Rainforest 
Rainforests cover just six percent of Earth's surface yet contain almost half of the world's plants and animals. With a diversity of mammals, birds, and bugs unrivaled almost anywhere in the world, Panama's Barro Colorado Island is the perfect microcosm of nature. Every year, passionate and dedicated scientists gather to this oasis of life, scaling the treetops, from canopy to forest floor, in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the rainforest. Follow them as they explore how life thrives in one of the most complex habitats on Earth.
