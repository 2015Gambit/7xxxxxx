[V],twentyforty,2012-08-12T09:57Z,"@ALL: Due to unimaginable percentage of pure Hit&Runs (people just take and seed shit back) I will go into my well known ""48h rotation"" - meaning how I will seed 48h and then upload new torrents and seed those exclusively.

Thanks ani to point this out (for ""Mockingbird"" torrent).

For example: my ""Pelican.Brief"" was downloaded 544 times in four days BUT - has only two seeders! Some nice soul and myself seems as  only fools who know what sharing and torrenting means.

I will not allow to become target of ""Idiots United"" & Co. who give a shit to people around, fill their own bellies and run back under their own rock.

""You've made your bed, now lie in it""
""It's Not How Much You Make, It's How Much You Give""
and
""Do Not Shit where you Eat

are things to consider.

,supcena,2012-08-12T10:58Z,All uploaders work hard and put in so much effort ripping stuff just so that we can download em for free ....the least one can do for them is seed their torrents and keep them alive ....i seed all torrents i download as long as my PC is active and it doesn't affect my browsing speed in anyway ....i don't understand why people can't do this little bit when seeding does them no harm !!
