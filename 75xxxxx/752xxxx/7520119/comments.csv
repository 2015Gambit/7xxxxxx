,BBfan,2012-08-11T10:37Z,"I love how black people keep saying the President is black. For one thing he came out of a white women and was raised by a white women. His black dad, aka sperm donor, beat the hell out of him and his brother and helped make the President a drug addict when he was younger. So for one thing. He is only half black. White inside and black looking outside mostly. Also, the worst President of all time. "

,TaiTheGuy,2012-08-11T14:45Z,"I didn't even have to read the comments before I just KNEW!
I saw the picture at the top & said ""hmm, I wonder [not IF] HOW MANY racist ass comments their are bound to be"".
It really doesn't make sense that on ThePirateBay, in a community of tech-savvy computer owners & entertainment buffs, I seem to find more hate than anywhere else.
In the domain of millions of people, from all over the WORLD who are SHARING!
Ther r far more sexist, who are against women's rights, than ther r racist in reality... So where are all the Lady-bashers?
Maybe it's just because the majority of the racist users are returning, looking to get a rise out of every1, and maybe talking shit about bitches doesn't get ther rocks off.
I should just start ignoring it. Let em realize that they're wasting there time.
WE SHOULD ALL JUST START IGNORING THE RACIST COMMENTS!"
[V],blaze69,2012-08-11T16:58Z,"WoW, what's with all the Racist Comments ? jeeez.

Thanks for the up extremezone, very much appreciated :)"

,kew87,2012-08-11T22:06Z,"jepp, nigger movie delux.. wtf"
,sorasbestfriend,2012-08-11T23:58Z,"the ultimate nigger movie for niggers. sorry i just had to say it and you all know it. on every imdb board you'll always see them on the front page complaining that there was only one black dude in every single movie, therefor racist. but when i see this crap i can't think it's racist even though there's only one white dude in the entire movie? flawless logic!"
,mjones2012,2012-08-12T01:26Z,Great copy thanks!!!! uh oh now with these harsh comments seem like we have some Wade Michael Page supporters in the building!!!
,NuSeble,2012-08-12T04:09Z,"I just love how most people who don't see their ""hate"" comments post them twice.. thinking that ""Damn, I rage comment didn't go though.. fuck, lets copy/retype it so it will work again"" 
You guys crack me up.. and as for John Hanson? he was white, perhaps you should have paid more attention in History class? 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hanson
as for the movie, its a good movie. nothing wrong with it, or its actors. people just hate for no damn reason."
,chillwill2010,2012-08-12T05:46Z,"i see alot of these comments are racist.get a life! its a movie.if you dont like it no one is forcing you to watch it,or move to colorado with the rest of the deranged lunatics the kill random people out of hate."

,Shan711,2012-08-12T07:16Z,"This movie is great and funny..Kevin Hart is hilarious. These terrible racist comments on here on the other hand, are not funny and quite disturbing. Thank you @extremezone !"
,Shan711,2012-08-12T07:19Z,LMAO @dick9918 !! :D
,ironymon,2012-08-12T08:39Z,"Black movie and supplier/ripper ""Cocain"" This in itself is racist. I just pointed it out. Racist for jokes should be fun and allowed. For others reasons, no. I don't mind being called white cheese, or snowflake or whatever, sure we whites faced genocide lot more than blacks suffered slavery, i just don't care what happened in the past."
,nedzweet,2012-08-12T09:59Z,Why racist people feel compelled to showcase their diminished capacity for reason for all to see is beyond me.

You think John Hanson was black?. So being one percent black and 99% white makes you black? People with purple gums are too funny."

,Sknmissle,2012-08-14T15:26Z,"I am by no means racist but i think i give it a shot

1. Do you know why black people are so tall? == Because their Knee-Grows,

2. Do you know why they put cotton in the top of Aspirin bottles? == To remind black people they picked cotton before they sold drugs.

3. What word starts with an N and ends with an R an it is something you never want to call a black man == ""NEIGHBOR"""
,-WallpaperZ-,2012-08-15T11:30Z,"niggers heaven. hey, if thats what you put on the front cover, thats what your gonna get back. same as if u put a heroin addict with a needle hanging out his arm, the first word that comes to mind is junkie. its human nature, deal with it. we are all racist to some extent."

,toenob,2012-08-20T09:45Z,"""Ignore all the racist comments"" says the guy that just called all women ""bitches,"" also on another note people might be getting their ""rocks off"" by saying racist things, but you can't just ignore those comments. If you don't speak out against things that are wrong they just continue to happen, do think that slavery and segregation would have ended if nobody had stood up and said/fought for what they believed in?

,Abe10777,2012-08-25T15:08Z,"hahah it's so ironic that in the middle east we're not racist to blacks yet they're not successful, I mean I rarely see a black dude as a docter or engineer, while in the US you see them very seccessful! hell obama is proof! so keep hating you racist retards and they will only rise up of hate and stomp your white face. If you can't live with blacks, reds, yollow, etc go live in the moon it's totaly white. I'm white btw"

,CRSARM,2012-09-01T04:48Z,"My son went to see this movie with friends and has talked about how funny it is every since, he kept telling me to get it.

Today I come here to get the movie and I scanned the comments as I always do and was shocked.  I scrolled back up and looked at the cover, the thought never crossed my mind to see if it was black or white acting in it, it did not matter to me.  My son said it was funny so I wanted to check it out.

Base your like or dislike of a movie on how good it really is, the color of the actors does not matter.  I heard it was a good movie so I am going to watch it.

Did I mention I am white AND from the USA?  Don't let these racist idiots be a true representation of MY country that I signed up and swore to give my life to defend.

That is my buck 50 worth of opinion (inflation and all).

Enjoy the movie."

,Proceon,2012-09-09T05:55Z,"I think that humans tend to take note of their differences instead of their commonalities.  Any belief system, ideology. religion, or culture that causes a separation or segregation of the species, or if it divides the species, oppresses the species, exploits them , or places one human above another is a false and  destructive belief or ideological system whatever it may be. Although technologically, we may consider ourselves advanced, humans today still live and exercise the same belief systems that their ancestors did thousands of years ago. in essence, they are living a myth. 
   Ironically, humanity will never reach the epitome of its evolution untill all races meld into one. That human will possess all of the genetic information, immunities etc. of all of the races combined. That will be the most resilient human.  Humans place labels upon themselves in an effort to establish commonalities with others.  It affords them opportunities to make friendships and trusts. What if there were no religions, no cultures, or nationalities, or political parties etc.  What would our differences be then? The human species has suppressed itself by quibbling over its petty differences for tens of thousands of years.    And the very fact that you people are having this conversation makes my point perfectly clear.   
   Perhaps history will serve us best when when we finally learn to leave it where it belongs, which is in the past. History is to be learned from so that we may become wise. History is not intended for us to live.
