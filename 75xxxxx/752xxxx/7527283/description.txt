"16 Hours"

In the aftermath of T.J.s overdose, Elaine finds 
herself torn between staying by her sons side 
and handling the rescue of a Chinese submarine. 
Bud discovers the truth behind T.J.s suicide 
attempt last December, and takes matters into his 
own hands. In exchange for keeping Susan quiet on 
T.J.s overdose, Elaine grants her unlimited 
access to the submarine rescue mission, placing 
her at the front of the action, and leaving 
Douglas to cross a boundary that could jeopardize 
his future.
