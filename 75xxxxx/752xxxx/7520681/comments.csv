[T],SecTPB,2012-08-30T21:05Z,I'll give a review on whether it's working or not after download.
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-30T21:06Z,"@kmstev
Copy it over to your PS3's external hard drive or internal hard drive and open it in MultiMan, just as you would any other 3.55 FW fix."
[T],SecTPB,2012-09-01T01:43Z,"Yes. This game works. I tested it using True Blue, but True Blue is not needed. It works with or without it.

Copy the game folder to your GAMES directory on your external hard drive(internal untested).

Copy the .pkg file fix to the root of your external drive.

Install the fix .pkg.

Enter Multiman.

Start game.

You're done."
