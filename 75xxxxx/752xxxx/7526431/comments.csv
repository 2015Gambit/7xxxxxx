Thereâs no changelog available, but I assume that this release (just like the previous THETA release) includes all the available Downloadable Contents: Cemetery, Deadlyforce, Gorillawarefare, Maxpayne1pack, Silentkiller and Specialed. Not 100% sure on that, so correct me if Iâm wrong. Enjoy guys!"

,Marcosmgt,2012-08-14T04:31Z,"Thanks, really solved some bugs and even comes with a DLC, you and the guy (+1)"
,Dj_Ziio,2012-08-14T06:25Z,"thanks for the update, worked flawlessly!  One request though, could you put the crack in a separate zipped file, my antivirus kept deleting it as soon as it was downloaded and i thought the update broke my install.  Its the gsrld.dll, its a false positive (lots of reloaded games use this dll)  but i'm sure i'm not the only one with antivirus that auto cleans downloaded files.  Just my 2 cents, thanks again for the wonderful upload, time to go back and slow mo kill some bad guys."
,Dj_Ziio,2012-08-15T07:47Z,"Ok game works but one of the files installed a shitload of viruses on my computer, inculding win64/patch.a Trojan, which antivirus is unable to delete, the game works fine but be prepared for hours of manually unistaling a virus"
,dougr944,2012-08-15T19:18Z,"When you say ""copy over the ""profiles"" dir, found in the Crack dir"", do you realize there's no ""profiles"" dir in the Crack dir? I got 87 files but a profiles dir ain't one."
,GustavSWE,2012-08-17T19:38Z,When can you upload the new patch v.1.0.0.49 ? Thx
,GustavSWE,2012-08-20T16:33Z,plz answer...
,MLO89,2012-08-22T00:28Z,"Only way I can play this game is with internet cable unplugged. Windows 7 firewall has all 3 exe files blocked but each time trying to start game with internet cable plugged in, the game tries to update anyway. Don't know what the deal is."
,Scrapith,2012-08-22T06:40Z,"Stay away from this, there is a virus in one of the files, not sure which one... my trend micro and malwarebytes antimalware could not detect whatever it is.

I have the reloaded version of the game that comes with the 1.0.0.17 update. and the game works fine, completed the game awhile back.

however today i reinstalled the game and played through the first level, then decided to see what updates there are that might fix any bugs or increase performance.

just after installing the 3 updates from this torrent my computer started to get slow, i checked resource monitor and saw it was trying to access a crap load of different/random ip addresses.  it also disabled my trend micro firewall, and re-disabled it every time i enabled it.

i also could not access any sites in my web-browser, could not even access my routers ip address, the virus disabled all communications but had access itself to connect to these ip addresses.

nothing worked to get fix the problems until i ran a system restore, there was a restore point created when i installed maxpayne3 so that was a bit of luck."
,br1ng1t0nh0,2012-08-25T07:19Z,i have to problem with game crashing at the loading screen as well. any solution for this?
,TheW1zarD,2012-08-25T13:53Z,why does it detect a virus in the .exe?
,Kin09,2012-09-05T22:43Z,Anyone got a virustotal for this one? Is it just false positive or the other way?
,Tyreneous,2012-09-09T22:40Z,"Now correct me if I'm wrong.. I have been a black beard for quite some time and am fairly knowledgeable on computers and software and comodo detects a viral infection in the gsrld.dll file in the .28, .29, .49, and .55 updates I've downloaded thus far.. however it did not detect a virus in the .22 update that I also have... how is it that the .22 does not show up as positive yet the others do? I have read reports of people's computers going into lock down and the files phoning home to all these random IP addresses... I see that you have the ""trusted"" symbol.. what does this exactly mean? Trusted by who's standards? does this mean that everything you post is tested and scanned by you? and that it does not contain anything bad like a virus? just find it funny how the other updates are infected and .22 isn't....  and now .47 shows up positive.... hard to believe this is a false positive people... call me stupid if it makes you feel better."
