[T],rkstr,2012-08-10T16:07Z,people who complain about the lack of seeders in the first 5 minutes of a torrent being uploaded are the worst!

,WuzzlePopple,2012-08-16T18:31Z,"Hi, will you be uploading episode 6 too? or for the rest of the season? I will seed if you do! "
,WuzzlePopple,2012-08-16T20:02Z,I found out episode 6 did not show this week.  But that don't mean I can't ask if you will upload it next week. I always seed. Thank you for your efforts.
,KitteyMeow,2012-08-19T04:17Z,can you please get ep6
,ihb1988,2012-08-21T23:39Z,Great Quality!!! you are awesome! I noticed you had uploade episode 6 yesterday but there was issues with the video. are you going to re-upload a better version soon?
[T],rkstr,2012-08-22T12:12Z,demanding the next episode is neither thanking me or rating the quality of the upload and is frankly just rude.
