QC 58 - Hydro-Carbons

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The geometry of Hydrocarbons is revealed as one branch of organic chemistry resulting from compound Tetryonic bonding of elemental nuclei.
Methane through to Benzene and a number of Carbon ring molecules are represented

The fifty-eighth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
