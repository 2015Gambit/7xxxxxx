eTextbook of "Mechanics of Materials, 3rd Edition" by R. R. Craig, Jr (c2011). A single largish bookmarked, page-numbered PDF file (57 MB) complete with table of contents, appendices and index. Quasi-native PDF quality.

Description and table of contents: Google the string "Wiley Craig productCd-EHEP001802" (w/o quotes)

COMMENTS:  
- Solution manual for the 2nd ed. available here on TPB (uploader: AbdallahBoOdY1991).
- Every student in civil engineering should have a copy of this excellent text. MEs and AEs? Likewise, IMHO. The procedures used to solve simple problems are a nice introduction to the concepts and computing tools (e.g., finite element method, FEM) that will be used to solve more complex problems later (structural design).
