The film deals with a tradition quite common in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh etc. where, in the event of the death of the husband, the woman has to marry the husbands brother irrespective of the differe- nce of the age. In case there is no real brother, the nearest cousin lays claim on her and the property as well. The heroine of the film -Sanjhi- revolts against the custom and would not allow the younger brother -Chand-of her husband, who was murdered-to have conjugal relations with her and prefers to face consequences.
