But let me remark, that there are more than 300 million people in the US (-with talented people in sports for sure-), meanwhile in Hungary only 10 million. it was predictable that the US we'll be on the first place. but despite of the small number of our country (Hungary) we finished at the 9th place, ahead of Japan or other bigger countries....so i think it's a really remarkable performance from us."

,kj011,2012-08-14T04:48Z,Thank you very much for including the closing credit montages. They are always so uplifting and moving even though NBC's Olympic coverage this time was the worst. 
,kj011,2012-08-14T06:15Z,I can't hear the sound.. Am I the only one?
,SCSA420,2012-08-14T07:36Z,This show has 48khz 384 kbps AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 channel audio and there is nothing wrong with it here it plays fine and sounds great. Maybe you need to install K-lite codec pack on your PC and configure it properly. It has all kinds of video and audio codecs along with media player classic home cinema that can play back any type of video or audio file
