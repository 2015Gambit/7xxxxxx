Black Box do it alot actually, and if it was bs i would send you to one of those stupid survey sites to get the password.

Link to Black Box website showing that there is a password: http://blackboxrepack.com/mirrors-edge-black-box/"

,tuniturntablist,2012-09-07T15:51Z,"EDIT: Sorry about my other comment! I fixed the crash and here is how:  go to ""C:UsersusernameDocumentsEA GamesMirror's EdgeTdGameConfig"" and open the file ""TdEngine.ini"", look for the line ""ResX"" and ""ResY"" and make sure they are set to your native screen resolution, save file and play! thanks for the torrent."
