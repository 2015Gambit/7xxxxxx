,tmntemps,2012-08-11T01:37Z,"its probably a fake anyway, Sumerian is pretty savvy when it comes to keeping their shit under wraps"
,king0pa1n,2012-08-11T04:22Z,"It's not actually a fake. You can partially listen to the songs, even if the torrent is stuck at 5.9 percent right now. The album is sounding good. Also, PLEASE SEED!"
,diminisheddarknut,2012-08-11T13:03Z,"Yeah, its real.. just stuck at 5.9 percent.."
,diminisheddarknut,2012-08-11T14:43Z,"I wonder what will come first. This download, or the actual fuckin release date of the goddamn album."
