,OmniNegro,2012-08-14T03:41Z,"Releaselog and OrlyDB list this as 9.9 MB. Is this modified or just unpacked? 

And if just unpacked, can you explain what is different from this one and the even larger one by the same name posted by mixednuts a while ago?

Yours has less files. I have no idea if this means it is better or worse. Nor even if either of them are legitimate."
