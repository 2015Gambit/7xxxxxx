QC 43 ΓÇô The Periodic Table

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

A new Periodic table reflecting all the quantum numbers of the elements and their relationships to other elements is revealed, replacing the Mendeleev periodic table with a table that is reflective of the true quantum geometries and properties of all the periodic elements.

A table displaying the polar elevation of ALL elemental nuclei is created for the first time showing their true atomic radii dimensions

The forty -third chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
