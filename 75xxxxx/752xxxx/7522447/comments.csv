Burn normally with IMGBUR.  speed should be 2 or 2x not more than that.
It will work. Before burning make sure you check with ABGX360

Make sure you have autofix level 3 
And in Options Tab ( second tab ) 4 first options should be checked mark and also check Use colors Check game partition crc aswell.

Click analyze, if you see green and blue without error go ahead with burning. if you see yellow its warning if you see red then its dead lol"

Just for your response on turncate disc
you don't need any iHas burner or lt2.0 downgrade .
I have created couple of discs with truncate method and they all works fine.
There must be another issue with guys.

I have only issue with darksiders. I tried last night first it didn't work ( no recognized disc ) I tried again and then it work I played nearly 20mins and then there was a bug, horseman can go anywhere even in air dark lol and i coucn't play this way and then I had to reset but it got stuck same as before i tried first time :(
I am going to burn again on another disc just got 20 dual banana disc very cheap and my all games worked on those discs, I have blue ray drive on my HP Core2Quad pc, it runs blue ray discs also burns cd/dvd r/ dvd R DL ( dual layers ) i have made 26 discs in a month :P since i got xbox 360 :D yahoo... and all workd fine except this darksider2, there must be burning issue may be burning speed as I changed to max, it should be 2 or 2x not more than as per the requirements of burning xbox iso on discs.

,rajtalreja,2012-08-17T18:55Z,"@DanQuiros
Game is verifiable now. anyone can verify with abgx360 and build iso again for verification.

What was your speed or burning make sure it is 2 or 2x?

@ sinshixxi
Sometimes it worm motor in xbox360. why my disc working sometimes and sometimes not ? and suddenly gets stuck ? only this darksiders2.
I created darksiders 1 and also finished few days ago. :D"
,sinshixxi,2012-08-18T05:41Z,"@rajtalreja 
Don't make it confusing. The iso is always correct if you verify with AGBX. It is not correct only for your burning method.

I just put it in short for XGD3 games:

If you have Liteon iHas DVD burner or cross-flashable brands flashed with burner max firmware, then you can burn 100% copy with an appropriate setup in imgburn software (need Singapore Verbatim disc). Doesn't matter LT3.0 or 2.0 if you play offline.

If you don't have this DVD burner, then you must burn in turncated (97% data) in imgburn. You must use LT2.0 because LT3.0 won't run the turncated disc. Do not hope to get online later, you'll be flagged with turncated disc even you playing it offline and get online later on."
,DanQuiros,2012-08-18T09:37Z,"I have LiteOn iHAS324 B (AL1B firmware) drive. I burn at 2.4x (because the drive ""does not allow to burn slower"" than that. I still select ""Truncate"" all the time since i have burned a lot of games like that before with no issues at all. Should I try  the ""overburn"" option?"
,sinshixxi,2012-08-18T13:54Z,"@DanQuiros
you're wasting your burner because you can flash it with max burner firmware. You can go to LT3.0 official page they have a link to get max burner firmware. Inside the zip file it has a pdf tutorial that is very easy to flash your DVD burner. For 100% success media, you need Singapore Verbatim DVD+R DL either in media code mkm001 (must burn at 2.4x) or mkm003 (must burn at 4x). You'll find the media code under imgburn. Regarding imgburn option setup, you can find it easily LT official page."
,sinshixxi,2012-08-18T17:34Z,correction: LT3.0 can run truncated disc. Sorry to give wrong info in my previous post. There's no  point to use LT3.0 now
,rajtalreja,2012-08-18T21:29Z,"@sinshixxi 
This is a bit lame to just discard one gamer's opinion.

I only gave another opinion because I did new windows on my pc and i did max speed setting but without verification with ABGX its risk to make any dvd. it will work for some and it wont for many.

In my case what I posted it is real issue with the heck.

I burn another disc today I got 20 new dual layer discs, did everything same way and game installed 100%. I only have doubt that my first disc didn't work proper due to high speed from my burner i chooses. This time i did with 2x only and also did turncate ( imgBurn has this Truncate feature it self ) nothing to do with iHas burning as far as my experience. 
My game is working flawlessly. 

one issue I received after few minutes on Darksiders 2 that Disc faild to authorize.
Then I did play another trick.

Which I am posting in another comment. and this is being used from 2009 dude. ( since i started burning games nearly 30 games so far in a month I faced no issue with Truncate method on my normal BD ROM Drive also without truncate. They all works fine without iHas burner."

Worked on Prototype
Worked on Maxpayne 3
Worked on my Console on Darksiders 2 aswell ( Proof is above )

Instruction XGD3 turncated games through hard drive ( Disc in drive ) without Failed to Authorize.

If you have the latest dashboard and lt3.0+ without an ihas burner, and you get a failed to authorize disc error all you need to do is play a song from a flashdrive before you start the game, after the game starts you can turn the song off. there shouldn't be a problem.
I tested it with max payne 3 and it worked.
try with other games and let me know if it works with them as well.

EDIT:

You don't have to keep the song running after you've booted the game, unless the game has a menu to select a different game (Like DMC HD). Just play song - run game - stop song.
It's just that in some game the music won't play if there's a song running in the background (Again, like DMC HD).

The iso verifies perfect through ABGX360 and burns with zero ""0"" erros, no issue whatsoever with IMGBURN. I burned the game the same way as I burned Max Payne 3, Ghost Recon: FS, Sleeping Dogs, etc. ALL my games play perfect and flawless except this one. :(. I have no clue what's wrong with this particular game. I'm getting frustrated cause I already wasted 7 dvds. "

Buddy what issue are you having with it?

Tell me few things

1. Burning speed?

2. Did you Try ImgBurn ??

3. When your game gets stuck ? 

Note: My 1st disc which was little expensive and i burned with max speed I think i did wrong. every time, first time it started and when I start new game n then it stuck ( my console got hanged ) i had to shutdown manually.

Then game never workd for few days but in between it started but game went stop again and same message on dashboard Unrecognized disc ( the console was not reading the disc at all and it was showing empty )

I burned another disc ( local DL R disc ) today which is working well ( same like all other games I burned so far ) I have wrote above that how I made it work."
,1atera1us,2012-08-19T01:33Z,"@danquiros

dont worry to much bro im using a ihas 324 with burner max (lt3.0) as well and its not working for me either. my sleeping dogs works 100 percent. Its either this rip this game or something to do with the 324 (doubtful sense its the same hardware as the others).

abgx gives me all green and image burn verifies 100%. when i put it in my xbox it says play game but no image appears. when i start it it says dirty disc. if i hit game details from the dash it will take me to the darksiders 2 info page but doesnt give me the option to play or install just rate."

Buddy you can create .dvd file just quick
here is the code
follow the instructions

1. open note pad
2. copy this code and paste in your notepad

Code to copy is below ( just two lines )

LayerBreak=2133520
imars-ds2-360.iso

Note: You can rename your iso and then you have to place the exact name of your iso in dvd file.
DVD file actually read the iso and layerBreak code for burning in imgBurn so don't get confuse. dvd file should contain the proper name as it is you have given on your iso file.

if you have renamed the .iso file then you have to change the name in dvd file that's it. 

now save your notepad file as imars-ds2-360.dvd on same location where your darksiders 2 file iso file is saved. Now double click dvd file it will your imgBurn program will run, check your speed 2x or 2.4 and calculated Optimal check should be checked in the settings of "" WRITE ""tab
If you don't  get this steps then open abgx360 

To create .dvd file with ABGX360 automatically 

In Options tab make sure you have checked mark the Check / Create .dvd file :D

This option check if you have a dvd file correct or not, or if you don't have the dvd file at all then it will create for you .. and we are done."

Buddy, you didn't read me proper i guess.

I am not fan of live games on xBox ( I only verify just to make sure it works without any issue )

I have ps3 250GB slim latest model and I play on that console couple for some live gaming with original discs.

On my xBox I have burned all the game without any issue. New games new techniques to stop piracy nothing else.
Finally I found solution for darksiders 2 which helped others aswell.

buddy abgx360 and Kprobe uses the same methods for checking :D ( nothing to do with burning )

By the way I have not tried kprobe yet.

ABGX360 checks for stealth and fix bad rips so you won't be detected by XBL. ( I am using abgx360 only to check iso so then I can play offline games on my console without any issue) 

Issues:
Its either the discs(wrong speed or no proper instruction followed ) or your burner or a dying laser in your 360 or WARM MOTOR. 

in my case i did wrong speed first time lol

it is also possible that a wrong setting in ABGX360 would make them not play or would create issue time to time. Make sure you follow the latest abgx360 settings can be found in google or youtube easily.

First off, thanks here I found the necessary setting to write the first max Payne 3 cd successfully. Unfortunately the second CD gives me the same problems so I wanted to get an advice if possible. The thing is I am having the same problem with darksiders.

I have Liteon ATAPI IHAS524B using Verbatim mk-003.

1. EEPROM setting are:

Smart burn - on
Force Hyper - on
Over Speed and Online tuning - off
I clear OPC before every write.

2. ABGX - green

3. IMGBurn setting are:

a) Perform OPC check on. 

b) I/ buffer - 512mb as well as build page 2 - read buffer 512mb
c) One last thing - I get this message when I launch it , could it perhaps be the problem - W 14:33:59 Duplex Secure's SPTD driver can have a detrimental effect on drive performance.
(checked online it says to uninstall daemon tools or alchool, but I don't have them)

You must have made some wrong setting or didn't verify the iso file bfore burn
make sure you check before burning
burning speed requirement is 2 or 2x not more than that.

1. Verify your iso with abgx360
2. Burn with IMGburn

You have not mentioned what error or trouble you are facing with darksiders 2?


If your game is not booting at all than you have fucked up the disc burning lol

If your game starts and hangs / get stuck then read back my message and play that trick it will work.

,briebee72,2012-08-27T20:05Z,wow what a bunch of morons. all you idiots telling people they dont need ihas need to shut the fuck up. truncated discs are not supported with LT+3.0 so yes you DO NEED a ihas burner. xdg3 disk images are bigger then a standard dvd-dl and you need the ihas burner with the upgraded firmware to allow the disk to be over burned.  when you truncat a disk image you are removing parts of the original image to make it fit the disk. and as anyone who has done the max payne 3 update can tell you after that truncated disks wont work anymore and your gonna get yourselfs banned. if you think for one sec that microsoft cant detect that you are useing a game image that has had parts removed well then you deserve the ban your gonna get. as for anyone modded to  LT+3.0 it does not support truncated disks anymore for this very reason so that is most likely the reason all of you have problems if your on lt+3.0 truncated disks do not work you have to get an ihas burner and do it right stop being so damn cheap and stop listening to these jackasses on here. for god sakes do things the right way and you wont have any problems.

no offense with your comments and experience.

First thing about getting banned and that is not possible.
I do not play online with my XBOX360
I have PS3 320 for that to play Original games and play online. But I am not fan of online games.
I am IT Guy I get too much work and only love playing games from childhood.
I only did truncate because I needed todo that as I know it will work and I am not using it online.
I have mentioned in my few posts that I am playing it offline, you might have missed it.

I have no complaint with iHas burner.
It was question about the game was not working at all and everyone was posting their own opinion.
Some I guided some I got inform via forums and some from other websites and this is how it works.
I not mode hacker I am not any crackers. I am just a pirated game downloaded for my xbox and make it work with some tricks and tweaks just like darksiders works well and I have ended the game 6hrs ago.

Agree with your point that boobsman got all the xbox collection and I have downloaded most of the games eg latest and some old non of the game had any issue in burning neither in playing until I have finished.


My point was only burning game with a normal dvd writer which support dual layer things.
Many of the guys had no LT3.0 or had wrong settings in burning methods that's it.

Your main point is for ONLINE.
So sorry I am not commenting on that and I never did.

Thank you for telling me how to research and that is actually my first work I do on everyday basis and I do not claim any lame excuses.

Anyway thanks alot.
I only know I helped few people who had issue. I also know that I got help from some sites as I am not xbox moder or cracker. a simple pirate downloader to save some bucks."

I don't need backups, those dvds works well, after finishing the game I don't play again.
I keep them safe and infact you can copy the same disc with nero burning
if you have two dvd roms you can simply copy disc to another
I have did some copies for my friends instead burning with imgBurn again and waiting for another 90mins due to slow speed.

Again no online thing I am or my friend who I made some copies are interested :D

if your console is modded anytime you can get shit so y to take risk
I am very much safe with my PS3 :D

Note: It wasn't any attack on you / your choice or experience or anyone else thoughts.

Truncates games worked for me Gears of war 3 I got from market when I first purchased and I got xbox only for Gears of war as I love it.
I changed nearly 9 discs from market ( people know me so I could return without wasting any money )
After that I burned the first game was gears of war 3 and then it was gears of war 2 and then 39 others I have 44 games in one month and I have not wasted a single disc with truncate method or without truncate.

I only got shit with one disc because I did the full speed burning to 16x speed which it didn't supported with darksiders 2, next I did it will with normal speed. it happened because of my new hd installation on pc with new windows so settings were by default instead my own as per game requirements which is 2 or 2x.
