Jeffrey ArcherΓÇÖs 25 E-Book collection in Epub and Mobi formats with Calibre data (covers, descriptions, etc.)

Jeffrey ArcherΓÇÖs first book, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, was published to instant success in 1976. Kane and Abel proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on the New York Times bestsellers list.

Alongside his literary work, Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, was also a Member of Parliament (1969ΓÇô74), and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party (1985ΓÇô86). His political career ended with his conviction and subsequent imprisonment (2001ΓÇô03) for perjury and perverting the course of justice.
While in prison, he wrote the three-volume memoir A Prison Diary. His prison term also served as inspiration for several of the short stories in his short story book, "Cat O' Nine Tales".

I like to read my books in my kindle, Galaxy Tab or iPad, and pdf is not as versatile as epub and mobi. In fact, I donΓÇÖt consider doc, rtf and pdf as proper E-Books, given their rigidity. However, most of these ArcherΓÇÖs books were in pdf format, so I had to convert them to epub and mobi. I had to write several macros and took me a couple of days to do a proper conversion and cleaning job.  
So please, please enjoy them!
