 Man has long ascribed to fate or destiny      
 the problems he felt powerless to resist,     
 resigning himself to these perceived forces.  
 It is believed that if man commits an act     
 of good or evil, he himself becomes the heir  
 to that action. This is the concept of Karma, 
 derived from the Sanskrit word kri meaning    
 action. In Cape Karma, Manav (Sanskrit for    
 man), played by Rahul Dev, has a strange      
 destiny in store for him. He is a lonely man, 
 perpetually at a crossroad. Willing to play   
 his choices and eager to enjoy his freedom,   
 he is ever ready for one-night stands with    
 strange women, ready for new excitement, ready
 forΓÇªanything. And yetΓÇªlittle does he know that
 he is a on the edge of a dangerous precipice  
 in life. When his car crashes off the highway,
 he stumbles out to discover a mysterious door 
 right in the middle of the highway.
