QC 60 - Nuclear Fission

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

All radioactive decay processes are explained ΓÇô Alpha, Beta & Gamma decay along with the real nuclear processes that cause them and give rise to their by-products. 

Radio carbon dating of C14 isotopes and the fission of unstable atomic nuclei are also explained in contrast to current explanations of the processes

The sixtieth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
