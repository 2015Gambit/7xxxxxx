I borrowed the audiobook CD set from my local library, and ripped the discs using EAC to listen to the audiobook later. I converted the files to flac, each file around 330-360kbps. Most mp3 players can play flac files, but if you wish to have the audiobook in mp3 format, just ask and I'll upload it.

In total, the duration 8:37:46, and the size is 1.26gb, with 7 parts. It is in English.
