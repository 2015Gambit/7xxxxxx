err0001's shitty analoge rip is of course going to be popular because it is 
first and people flock to the first thing they can. That doesn't mean it is 
actually good.  

With the 4th episode of season 1 BBC America wised up and started producing the
show's discussion segments at the same frame rate as the clips from the episodes
are in, 25 fps. But for broadcast it gets all converted to 29.97 fps. And that 
conversion isn't done so well. err0001's rls is full of blended frames because 
of this and consequently a lower bits-per-pixel ratio too. err0001 doesn't give 
a shit. The 2HD digital cap and the AFG and mSD spin-offs of it all also have
blended frames. 

err0001 also doesn't give a shit about actually naming the rls properly and 
neither does anyone else it would seem. It is its own show of specials on BBC 
America, NOT a special that is part of series 7.
