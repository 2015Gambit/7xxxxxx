It is not a first look special, it's just an episode that cuts of 10 minutes into the show. At the end of the video it says ""coming up"" and shows you the scenrio that is going to happen, but that's it, there is no coming back. No ending credits, no title saying ""First Look Special"". And if you can go on The Bad Girls Club's own website and the videos they posted are available in your country then don't waste your time downloading this. Oxygen's own Bad Girls Club web page has little short clips highlighting episode 6, and this torrent is pretty much the same. I downloaded this link and watched it and thought this wasn't worth downloading, I just saw all these scenes on the website! You been warned! Save your computer the space. -1 Quality and F grade."

""The.Bad.Girls.Club.S09E06.First.Look.Special.HDTV-MegaJoey

*NOTE* NOT THE FULL EPISODE. Just a First Look Special

PLEASE SEED 	

But the episode is not titled ""First Look Special"", it's called ""Mexican Meltdown"". All confusing. "

I am sure the uploader is an awesome person. It is in great quality as in picture wise.  I guess the channel itself promoted it as a first look special, I don't know. But they do have the same scenes on BGC website as they do in this video posted."
