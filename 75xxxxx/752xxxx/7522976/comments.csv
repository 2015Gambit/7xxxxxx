,Kneph,2012-08-11T22:45Z,This needs seeding or something..everybody is stuck at .1% and nobody has the whole file
,Kneph,2012-08-12T04:54Z,For crying out...why upload this if you arent going to seed it??? This site says there are two seeders but my client says there isnt anybody seeding at all....SEED YOUR UPLOAD!!!!
,Kneph,2012-08-12T20:22Z,If you are stuck at .1%...delete all data and torrent. Then start the torrent again
,Kneph,2012-08-12T20:29Z,Never mind...still not able to dload cause this fucker refuses to seed this...fuck this torrent
,Marcosmgt,2012-08-13T02:02Z,What is problem of yours?Seed!
,LightSpawn,2012-08-13T14:05Z,"Hey newfriends, here's a useful piece of info for you: No games in the WWE series were released for PC. In other words, you won't be able to play this game. It's probably not even a game at all. Most probably a virus.

You're welcome."
[T],faren73,2012-08-15T20:01Z,"@LightSpawn. you're right, but people still try anyway. i know that when i see WWE that it's just BS and that the uploader strings everyone along for days and they never get it in the end anyway. it's almost always password protected and you will probably only end up with survey pages. my advice if you see WWE uploads is just forget about it!"
