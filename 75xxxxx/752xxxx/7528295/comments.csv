,Neldor,2012-08-13T22:01Z,"This release of the album is playing faster than it should. The songs are speeded up a bit.

For example first song should be 3:42, but is 3:22 instead. Which also makes Adam's voice a bit higher.

Listen to 'Shooting Star' from this release and then from OC's Youtube channel and you'll see the difference yourself."
,redtar,2012-08-14T09:57Z,@Neldor:  That's awful!  Def not downloading.

I definitely appreciate your effort :)
I can't as well wait for the full release. 

I just wanted to let everyone know that this is not the final version of the album (some might dislike OC because of that, for example).

Also, there is another torrent on TPB which contains the album in correct form.

Once again, thank you for your effort :)
Cheers :)"

,id8r,2012-08-15T17:11Z,"Hey NishLakhani thanks a lot for the upload! I'm sort of disappointed in Adam, this is definitely not like Sky Sailing or earlier Owl City songs :/ I do however like Silhouette"
,redtar,2012-08-16T00:58Z,Yeah this album is a huge disappointment.  He's just trying to get radio air time.  It's all dance-y and stuff.  Lame.
