The Top Hits of 1776 is an album composed by John Townley for the 1976 American bicentennial. It features a number of songs commonly sung during the era. Included is the song 'To Anacreon In Heaven' which you may recognise as the song the American national anthem is based on. I hope you enjoy this and I urge you to show your support for Mr.Townley by checking out his other work at http://www.astrococktail.com
