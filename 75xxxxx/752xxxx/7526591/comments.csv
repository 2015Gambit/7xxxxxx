http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6317887/WarGames.1983.720p.HDTV.x264-ESiR
I've played both, synchronized, with the same player, there's no difference at all between the 2 pictures. Good thing though, there's no Canal+ logo on the BluRay rip.
Not a big improvement over the HDTV rip, thanks nonetheless."
[T],VixenofVenus,2012-08-16T01:33Z,"Leto, a lot of the HDTV versions of older films are almost exactly the same as the bluray rips, usually minus a logo or with better audio quality.

The reason is, often the studio will air these older films on their HD networks prior to release on Blu-Ray, to help promote sales.  Not sure why, but trends show that for older films, this seems to actually help sales."
