A wonderful soundboard recording from the Secret World tour: Rosemont Horizon in Chicago. The setlist is pretty near to the official release but there are a few extra gems.

Quote from Jesper Moonen (MUPPET):

"Some extra information concerning this recording: this is the MUPPET05 remaster bootleg. It must have been three years ago already, but this was a long hidden recording, which I got generously donated by an anonymous trader (who's actually very well known, but for obvious reasons wants to remain anonymous). I then remastered this recording and MUPPET05 is what it became.

Apart from Games, Shock and Biko it also includes Joy Askew on keyboards and vocals (as well as Jean Claude Naimro on keyboards) but doesn't have Paula Cole. Blood of Eden is a beautiful version, way better than the official release IMO."
