mVideoPlayer is what I would say the best video player replacement application available for Android, with a lot of useful and handy features and a nice and clean interface it greatly improves on Android's built-in video player.

This app DOES ONLY PLAY WHAT YOUR PHONE ALREADY SUPPORTS so if you were looking for anything else, don't waste your time. It could however be used as a video library browser because it allows you to open videos with other applications.

Features:

    Subtitle Support: srt, ssa, ass, sub/idx, mpl, smi, txt, sub, sami.
    Internal MKV Subtitle (srt, ssa, ass), ONLY usefull on devices that supports playback of MKV.
    On-screen information such as time and battery. 
    Responsive, intuitive controls.
    Built-in subtitle search powered by OpenSubtitles.org, download and pair a subtitle with a video in less than 10 seconds.
    Video library with movie posters & inbuilt poster search.
    Imdb.com search, view information about your movie fast and easy directly within the app.
    Three listing opions: With posters, thumbnails or clean & simple.
    A lot of options for you to tweak to make the app fit your needs perfectly.
