[T],-Gabe-,2012-08-26T19:28Z,Is this in HDTV/Blu ray format? I'm handeling HD formats only. I couldn't find it. If you have some hints just tell me.

Oh, it's a shame! I don't think it's available in Blu-ray format.I lost it from my back-up.And it's no longer available in my country.As a cinemaphile ,I fully recommend it ! Its cinematography is not as beautiful as Ugetsu, but it's a good little flick.Upload or not , watch it if you get the chance.You've got great taste in films. 

Are you going to upload 'In the Mood for Love' by Wong Kar Wai ? its blu-ray version is releasing in Oct.Hope I can pre-request. ;)
Thanks in anticipation.

Yes, Tony will be uploaded in this format x264 / MKV / DVD / 712x460.  You will have it but not sure it will be soon.

In mods of love will be uploaded by me or someone else in 100% (just can't wait to see it)

Also inform my very few fans that I'm doing some lost Buster Keaton movies and Les Vampires (1915) from blu ray."
