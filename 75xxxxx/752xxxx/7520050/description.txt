Review:
A heartless industrialist has an evil plan: to level Arnold's neighborhood and build a huge shopping mall. With time running out, someone needs to save the day. And that someone is Arnold. With Helga, his pigtailed nemesis who secretly loves him, and Gerald, his cool best friend, Arnold takes a stand to prove the real meaning of progress - finding new joys in the old neighborhood he calls "home."
