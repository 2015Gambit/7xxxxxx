QC 45 - Atomic Shells

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

Atomic Shells and their direct relationships with Principle Quantum numbers is explained using Tetryonic energy geometries.

Along with the positions of all elements belong to each atomic shell

The forty -fifth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
