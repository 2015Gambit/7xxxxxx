Looking forward to hearing (and buying) this VERY much!"
,Szymszel,2012-08-17T10:42Z,"Thanks very much, but... why 48kHz?, is this not from CD?"
,beHD,2012-08-17T16:42Z,@Szymszel It is a original download from DCD web store.
,Gallino,2012-09-03T22:31Z,"Hello !
Be warned that this album is'nt verified as lossless by AudioChecker (not even one track).
It may be that DCD on their website are using upmixed flac files from a 192Khz master.
I found another release with 7 tracks verified as lossless, that certainly has been ripped from CD.
Nevertheless, many thanks for this share."

You can also find it in other formats such as Apple Lossless, MP3 and WAVE."
