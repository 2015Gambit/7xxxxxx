I'm not trying to be a winey little jerk that needs constant admiration, but the people who share their files work really hard to offer them to you (and free at that). All I'm saying is dropping a simple ""Thanks"" makes all of us uploader's feel more appreciated. It also makes us more apt to upload more files. Sorry about rant, and thanks for reading this.   "
