I noticed some people stating they were missing the KEYS.BIN file for the game, so here it is. if you want to do it another way:

There's a .iso/.cso to EBOOT converter out there that automatically creates a keys.bin file if the game calls for it. If I recall well, the name of said converter was "Simple PopStation GUI v2.21 BETA"

I hope this helps.
