QC 50 - Atomic masses

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

Atomic energy levels and their relationship to Hydrogen ionisation energies is revealed, in turn providing the basis for the development of a specific weight for all elements and compounds based on the Tetryonic geometry of all EM mass-ENERGY-Matter.

A table displaying the side elevation of ALL elemental nuclei is created showing their true atomic material dimensions for the first time in recorded history.

The fiftieth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
