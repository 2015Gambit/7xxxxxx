,beaujoulais,2012-08-14T07:31Z,pretty nice goodies - thanks as always!
,beaujoulais,2012-08-14T23:57Z,Thanks once again! I really was suprised about those very old but pretty nice pop songs! can't decide which one is my favourite! Maybe the Zombies' song because of strong Hammond organ chords - but the Lemon Pipers' song I missed so long.

As the lead singer of the Zombies,he was one of the greatest '60s rock vocalists"
,dehou,2012-08-16T00:31Z,thanks!
,beaujoulais,2012-08-16T01:03Z,"Wow, I found a link to British group ""Argent"" I know the brillant song ""Thunder & Lightning"" from. It was 1974 when they done their album ""Nexus"" ... is there a video available to see what's about ?
Russ Ballard was the singer there - a name we find at pop music repeated.
Maybe a good theme for a future part of HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC ?!"
,pupovaczlatko,2012-08-16T01:47Z,"a very good song indeed

Thanks for sugestion beaujoulais"
