,eleventy4,2012-08-11T22:19Z,"Haha, I started downloading this because I thought it was the game from last night.  But if I remember correctly, this is the game where Patrick Willis sacks Brett Favre, as the final ""fuck you"" for his game-winning TD the previous season, and the last time he faced the Niners.  Poetic :)"

,Acal57,2012-08-11T23:01Z,"Anyone care to upload this game in *.mp4, *.avi or *.mkv?"
,budallday,2012-08-12T03:46Z,why's it fuckin matter if its a rar?
,tensigh2,2012-08-12T07:25Z,"It matters if it's a .rar because 1. the rars often don't decompress, and 2. because it's totally stupid to make a rar of a compressed file!"
