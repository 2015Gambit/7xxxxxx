This visually stunning natural history book brings the animal kingdom closer than you've ever seen it before!
Dramatically close-up images of animals from insects to reptiles to mammals to birds reveal spectacular patterns and shapes. The colors, textures, and structures of all parts of an animal are presented in breathtaking photographs, challenging the reader's understanding of animals and their habitats.
An eye-catching cover will attract readers to this amazing look at some of the world's insects, fish, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. The focus is on animals small enough to fit in a child's hand. Siwanowicz showcases each creature with a spread containing a full-color, high-quality, close-up photo surrounded by multiple factual asides. A tiny silhouette map indicates where the animal lives, and is accompanied by information on the creature's status on the threatened species list and its scientific name, normal life span, and size. The book is packed with interesting material that captures the author's fascination for small creatures. This is a fascinating browsing title that will also work as a starting point for reports.
