Always spammers saying it's fake or has a password. Stupid*****!"

Noobs: Just look for the green skull and crossbones next to the uploader name to verify a know good uploader. If it's there...it's almost always legit. If not, it's almost always fake.

You can also check the file names by clicking on the number of files and looking at the extensions. MP4 extensions aren't password protected.

In other words, the only fake here is blind1980"
