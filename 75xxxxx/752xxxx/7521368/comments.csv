I notice you have made NO contribution.
Bio, as always a superb collection.
Thank you"

,dragonbandit314,2012-08-12T14:50Z,"No probs Bio. It is getting so hard to leave a comment on TPB that I find it incredible that there are negative vibes. Especially from some people that do not even contribute.
Still, you know you have your LOYAL followers. Be well."
