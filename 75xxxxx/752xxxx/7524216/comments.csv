Roommate and I got ripped and laughed 3/4 the way through it.  I originally thought this had the guy from 40year old virgin, but upon closer inspection and imdb, noticed that its the guy from ""Jeff who lives in the basement"" or something like that.

Anyways,  liked it would recommend."

""...The seen where her and her sister are doing the cookie monster and Elmo voices is pretty hilarious""

Its ""scene"" first of all.  Not ""seen"".

Second of all, your straight eating day old doughnuts on the daily. 

That ""scene"" was the worst part of the whole movie, and the roommate and I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be ""funny"" or not."
,dWdHELLCAT,2012-08-14T09:57Z,"Why are these low quality dvd downloads the most popular? it's 2012 people,theres this thing called 1080p blue ray,sure it takes a little longer to download,but it's well worth it if your a real movie lover with a high definition tv and surround sound system. "
,iamhelix,2012-08-14T11:22Z,"becasue most people like me don't give a fuck about difference between blueray rips and dvd rips, i would rather download it quicker anyway. (i have max download speed of 2.3Mb /sec and have unlimited) and even on my 40 inch tv these 700 mb files play fine and i have surrond sound but can't be bothered using it as i have to go to the lounge room then and i would rather watch it in my bedroom.

,sa_nick,2012-08-14T12:29Z,"I'll grab HD versions if it's something I'm gonna love or if I know it'll be well shot and worth being in HD.

But the 720/1080 rips do just take up more space on HDD's and chew through more bandwidth, which sucks if you're in Australia and limited to 20/50/100GB per month."

,FireIsHot,2012-08-16T04:58Z,"Wow, this is quality is pretty awful, if it looks this bad on my standard def lcd monitor I can imagine how much worse it'll be on my 1080p TV.

DVDs may not be as HQ as a BluRay, but they've come a long way and the Quality of this rip is sub-standard, it's pixilated and blurry. 

Watchable sure, better than a TS? Sure, but not by much imo. If your desperate, download this copy, it'll get you through, if you want an actual HQ DVD quality, wait like me for another rip. And yes there are plenty of much HQ rips out there in this range of memory.

,TornAsunder,2012-09-07T01:53Z,"Ironically, fourteen out of twenty ""professional"" movie critics liked the movie on Rotten Tomatoes, yet the ""critics"" here would disagree. Does this mean that ""real"" critics know a good movie while TPB critics don't or vice versa? No, it just goes to say that the opinions of other people aren't necessarily a reliable source of information that you should use as a basis for decision making. It's understandable if you're going to be making an expensive purchase and don't want to risk the loss of money on a product that sucks, but in this case, you're downloading a movie for free. Life isn't like the movie ""In Time"" where your time is money and very limited. I'd rather die tomorrow and have formed my own opinion about this movie than be a sheep for the rest of my life and follow the words of other people who are possibly the exact opposite of myself. Only you know whether or not you're going to like something."
,JosieQ,2012-09-08T11:13Z,"@TornAsunder

I agree with all you've said, except really life IS sorta like ""In Time"" because we trade our time and lives to shitty jobs in order to buy food and pay for rent and such.  They just made it a literal trade of time and life so we can really see just how much the establishment is screwing us.  (Also the depression isn't quite that bad yet, but hey it's getting there!)"
,JosieQ,2012-09-08T13:31Z,"Okay and as usual, all you nutjobs have crazy comments because this movie is good.  I laugh-out-louded several times, and I hate the idea of marriage and children.  What kind of shit movies DO you asshats like?"
