Placzek 2006 Orthopaedic Physical Therapy Secrets 2nd

We are pleased that the first edition of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy Secrets has become a standard study guide for the orthopaedic certification specialty examination. This text provides condensed, high-quality, preprocessed information that gets to the heart of orthopaedic examination, intervention, and outcomes. Orthopaedic Physical Therapy Secrets promotes the concept of efficient and effective practice and thus has also become a widely used, quick, and well-organized clinical resource guide.
We have included new, extremely detailed chapters covering differential diagnosis
and radiology. These chapters are a direct reflection of the direction in which contemporary physical therapy practice is moving. Likewise, we have added significant detail to the chapters covering anatomy, orthopaedic neurology, pharmacology, and the evaluation of medical laboratory tests. As always, we have emphasized questions founded on sound outcome-based and evidence-based research.

Orthopaedic Physical Therapy Secrets has gathered experts from a wide variety of
disciplines, including orthopaedic physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthopaedic surgery, radiology, rheumatology, spine surgery, sports medicine, exercise physiology, anesthesiology, and obstetrics/gynecology. This vast array of experts has made this text an exceptional, well-rounded quick reference and study guide for not only physical therapists, but also occupational therapists, athletic trainers, and primary care physicians.

We hope this text provides its readers insight into the rapidly advancing field of
orthopaedic physical therapy, and ultimately, benefits and improves the quality of life in those so important to us . . . our patients.
