In this episode Jamie Oliver is in for a surprise: instead of the expected insight into Italian cooking and ancient recipes, he has to teach six unhealthy monks of a monastery (Abbazia Benedettina di Santa Maria di Farfa) - who live of tin veggies and never have learned to cook - how to prepare healthy meals and have a little fun. I think it is impossible not to like this episode.
