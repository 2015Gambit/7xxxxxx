,Tomcat08,2012-08-13T06:25Z,"Thanks, Ez! Fantastic Quality as always!"
,kuronekogang,2012-08-13T07:06Z,It's asking for a password...
,bitchybutcher,2012-08-13T08:50Z,"kuronekogang; that's not even funny, go troll some MLP instead."
,nessinator,2012-08-13T09:23Z,1.5GB? wtf is included
,kuronekogang,2012-08-13T09:31Z,Ummm not trying to be funny. I've never had an Eztv torrent in RAR format and asking for a password. Anyone?
,VicVega,2012-08-13T10:45Z,You must be commenting on the wrong torrent. There's no RAR file in this one.
,Dingatron,2012-08-13T11:11Z,"The file thats being downloaded when i click on this torrent, is named S05E05!? Is anyone else getting that? 1.51GB file size..."
,FluffigtDjur,2012-08-13T12:33Z,"How much do they pay you guys to spread disinformation? Is it like that Chinese thing where you get a cent for each comment or are you like, high ranking anti-p think tank personnel who get 100$/h for fappinng and posting random shit all day. "
,ollox360,2012-08-13T13:36Z,Guys SEED! I'm not getting a download speed on this ..
,blahblahblah73,2012-08-13T15:25Z,"It's a RAR file cuz this person is to lazy to upload the actual show. You need to fish around for a password so, IMO, don't bother. Move onto a different person who can actually UPLOAD THE SHOW. "
,dgrayman13,2012-08-13T18:26Z,"everyone who says this is a rar is either a fucking retard, or a faggot troll from china who has nothing better to do. Click on the magnet retards and it opens in torrent program and clearly says .mkv even before you download"
,xpmule,2012-08-13T22:48Z,"do the lying & spamming retards know that anyone can click on the files number link right below the torrent category ?

Because if you do you will see clearly the file name and extension.. which is MKV !
Not RAR lol

Ultra stupid people or manipulative anti-piracy douches. what you guys think ?"
,nomad1980,2012-08-13T23:26Z,LEEHIGH FOOTBALL RULES!!!!!!!
,roseyang2012,2012-08-14T00:13Z,"thank you, very much!"
,balanced,2012-08-14T04:09Z,"You can see what files are included by clicking on the number next to the ""Files:"" label at the top of this page.  In this case there is one file and its' name is: True.Blood.S05E10.720p.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE.mkv

Obviously not a RAR file.  And you don't even have to start downloading it to find that out."
