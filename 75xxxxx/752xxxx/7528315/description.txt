PowerShell Tutorial - Erik Hjelmås - March 21, 2012

While programming languages like C/C++ are designed for low-level construction of data structures and algorithms, scripting languages are designedfor high-level “gluing” of existing components. Components are created with low-level languages and glued together with scripting languages. 

WARNING!
The following presentation is NOT meant to be a comprehensive/complete tour of the PowerShell language. The purpose is to get you started with some basic program constructions which you will recognize based on some-sort-of-programming-background. At the end of the presentation (Credits section) you will find pointers to more comprehensive material (reference material).
