this is my debut Indie/Folk album. i hold these songs very close to my heart. i hope that they mean something special to you when you hear them. thank you for taking the time to listen.

i know that many of you simply cannot afford to buy music albums, and i want you to know that i care about you. things will get better for you, and i hope it's sooner rather than later.

enjoy (:
