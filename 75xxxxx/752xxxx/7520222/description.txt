Museum Secrets Collection 
On a quest to find the best, and most obscure, museum exhibits and explore the secrets they hold, Museum Secrets uncovers the weird, the astonishing and fascinating wonders of the world. What unexpected device did Catherine the Great use to enhance her sex life? Why did Alexander the Great prefer linen armour to bronze? And how did the falcon hunting of the Habsburg emperors lay the foundations for modern science? Testing out the theories behind the artifacts and visiting the sites they originated from, this series combines pure enthralling history with surprising detective work.



11)  The Louvre 
Once a royal palace, the Louvre is now one of the world's greatest museums boasting 35,000 objects from prehistory to the 19th century, and visited by over 8 million people every year. Jousting is an extreme sport. And on June 30, 1559, the king of France found out exactly how extreme it can be. He took a lance through the eye hole of his helmet. Fragments drove deep into his brain. But he didn't die on the field. And why did a sea tragedy drive a young artist mad? On July 5th, 1816, a French passenger ship went aground off the coast of Africa. Of 147 crew members consigned to a life raft, only 15 survived. The Raft of the Medusa is Theodore Gericault's dark depiction of the sailors' plight, cast adrift in shark-infested waters
