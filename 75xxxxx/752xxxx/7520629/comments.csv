,IonP,2012-08-11T20:12Z,"New imdb note is 5.1. And far closer to the truth. It's actually a pretty good movie. Gorgeous graphics, nice action, good dialogue ... far better than I expected.

Far better than ST2 or ST3 or Warhammer.

I'd give it a 6,5.

Video 9
Audio 8 (clear, feels really low.. had to set everything to max to hear anything)"

,KKKDownlow,2012-08-13T10:03Z,When are they going to stop making these stupid movies? I mean the original was great but every other one has just been awful. Should have just made the first one and been done with it instead of ruining what could have been a classic.
,TaiTheGuy,2012-08-13T14:02Z,"A/V is great

M= I watched the first 8 minutes and then deleted it. So I can't say how much better it would have gotten. If you're willing to sit through more than 8 minutes of crap, you might as well TRY to watch it.

This is more for people who like X-Men, Transformers, GI Joe, CGI & Anime etc.
NOT for people who prefer films like Titanic, Bourne Trilogy, Mission Impossible, Crash, Syriana, The Book of Eli etc."

Video:7 (Some choppy moments on the more intense scenes, but good quality for the size)
Movie:8 

Not the best CGI film made in history, but definitely not the worst. Better then the second and third Starship Troopers movies combined, that's for sure. This is more for the fans of the original movie and book, not really for first time watchers. Still, pretty good, graphics are not FF:Advent Children good, but not to far behind. Worth at least watching. Movie deserves, at the very least, a solid 6.5, but i give it an extra 1.5 points for sticking true to the original and the book, with only slight changes to fit in ST 2&3's to the continuity."

,jompa67,2012-08-14T14:30Z,thanks
,WingZing,2012-08-14T22:20Z,I wouldn't say the movie sucked. It is directed by a Japanese anime director so it will have the feel of a Japanese CG animation feature. It does pay quite a bit of homage to the Aliens movie however. As with most movies you have to suspend your disbelief and just enjoy it.

There is Resident Evil Degeneration and Resident Evil Damnation, and they are WAAY better than the Paul Worthless Shit Anderson flicks.
There's also Beowulf, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Tekken: Blood Vengeance, Appleseed, Appleseed: Ex Machina, and Halo: Legends have a couple of shorts that are high quality CG. "
