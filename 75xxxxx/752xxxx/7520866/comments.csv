I have a problem with the ICE package. I copied the download into the folders in my (legal) Railworks installation, and after starting RW3 the ICE3 shows up in my list of trains and the scenarios on the Route Cologne-Dusseldorf (that route works perfectly), but if I start the scenario I get this error after loading. Does anyone know what to do?

,TheNemmy,2012-08-10T23:56Z,"can't find the train, even though cleared cache? what name does it have in scenarios / train lists ? can't find it with ICE 3"
,mr_ahmad,2012-08-11T05:00Z,"@everyone: This addon wil only work in cracked versn of railworks :)
And there is a slight error in scenarios folder, you need to manually create a 'Routes' folder in 'Content' directory and paste the fiolder with alphanumeric names in new 'Routes' folder.

Then u paste the 'Content' folder in ur railworks directory..

If you have problem accessing the passwords then you need to contact the admin of the site he will give you passowrd.
Since i cant share the fixed scenarios folder on here as piratebay doesnt allow links i wil post the fix in the forum :)"
,Mercyflush64,2012-08-11T18:41Z,It would be most helpful when you post scenarios and such if the required addons needed could be listed with a link to them as well. I did get this to work just fine after about an hour of figuring out what else I needed to install.
,TheNemmy,2012-08-12T10:16Z,"how can I manually create the folder 'routes' while it's already there, I didn't understand what are you trying to say and I couldn't run this addon."
