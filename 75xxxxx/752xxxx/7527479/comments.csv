,MyKrossini,2012-08-13T07:11Z,"Great upload. A/V 10/10... No password needed, that guy is trolling. Always solid uploads from ettv. Thanks ettv! I will be seeding for a couple days!"
,guestroy,2012-08-13T07:13Z,"Seeding my a$$ off, people."
,MyKrossini,2012-08-13T07:14Z,NO PASSWORD NEEDED! Those guys are trolling. Don't believe them. Anyone who knows ettv knows that they are an extremely solid and reliable uploader. 
,ironymon,2012-08-13T07:16Z,"So this airs around 5:00 at night... in my time zone... well, at least this cheers me up on wonderful mondays even more."
,xpmule,2012-08-13T07:24Z,"the password crap is probably from anti-piracy groups.. I can see MediaDefender is on this torrent

ettv has never posted a video that used a password so that user is trying to stir up shit i think."
,xpmule,2012-08-13T07:33Z,"What i find interesting about the anti-piracy scumbags is they are targeting this specific show and every single episode of this that gets released. They come out and start the whole password crap routine + fakes etc.

I have no doubt at all that there are ant-piracy organizations that are employed on behalf of some media companies to disrupt file sharing.
I point this out because obviously a lot of people are unaware of any of this (based on some peoples confused comments)

The morally superior ant-piracy side of file sharing are involved with a lot of shady and deceitful activity no better than any pirate. I guess they figure two wrongs, makes THEM right lol"
,kyla12,2012-08-13T07:46Z,"this is a real deal uploader people i just downloaded true blood ep 10 from this guy, waiting on this one so i can be set for the night"

,wguid,2012-08-13T08:08Z,"Really you guys DO NOT download this, you're wasting your time (and bandwidth) ..."
,g2redgsr,2012-08-13T08:32Z,idk why some people are saying theres a password and some are saying there isnt.  i got a rar file with a password that sent me to a website to fill out a survey if i wanted the password....maybe isnt because im on a mac and ppl on pc dont need a password?  idk but this does not working and im not filling out a survey....
,newtricks2,2012-08-13T08:41Z,no password needed.....The film industry can suck a dick......WE WON THE WAR......bye bye Hollywood......
,stoneartisan,2012-08-13T08:53Z,"thanks ettv, reliable and dependant as usual."

,omgwtfnoob,2012-08-13T09:26Z,"great quality... no password needed (idk wtf everyone else is doing that requires a p/w).

omg at the ending..."
,omgwtfnoob,2012-08-13T09:27Z,also theres clearly no rar files lol
,PirateTroll,2012-08-13T10:23Z,Apparently ettv has gotten a following of spam commenters who feel it's their obligation to attempt to direct users away from ettv downloads by acting as if theres a seedy rar and password. The internet can be so weird sometimes.
,SativaMeAt420,2012-08-13T10:42Z,"Thanks again ettv, I'll post A/V rating once I check it but if its from ettv I can pretty much guarantee its legit. @ everyone who cries regarding seeders one hour after the file is uploaded, are you fucking children with severe cases of ADD or something, BE PATIENT PEOPLE! It takes at least a couple hours for enough people to download the file and then seed, so quit bitching, be patient or I'm going to kill you with my Ricin cigarette, LMFAO!"
,crazyoliv,2012-08-13T12:44Z,"Thanks a lot for that every-monday-morning-summer--Hollyday-upload of Breaking Bad. That is what Summer-Hollyday means to me.

@ettv, I may ring to the wrong adress, but are you able to upload : both Olympics Cycling MountainBike Final Women and Men displayed Saturday noon and Sunday 1pm respectively.

French public service TV coverage suck you cannot imagine, and Sceneline - I respect very much - do not seems to get it.

Thank in advance, keep up the Great Green Skull work ."
,ginnz,2012-08-13T13:01Z,NEED SEEDS!!!!!!
,rockfist,2012-08-13T13:15Z,Cheers!
,cor.hor,2012-08-13T13:35Z,"Guys, I'm sure most of the ""fake"" people are legit.  I downloaded a fake torrent from ettv before for this show.  It's confusing because ettv took it down and reuploaded something that looked exactly the same, making it look like the new torrent was the exact same torrent as the old one, and hence I thought the new one was fake.

I don't know how ettv gets their shit, but it seems like they sometimes get fake shit instead of the real shit.  But I've figured out that they don't get fake shit on purpose, and as long as you wait a little while you'll get the real shit."

,jess_CRO,2012-08-13T14:56Z,thankuuuu another great download! Dont know what you people are whining about. Show was only put on here today! You are lucky enough to have it available to u for free!! If i dont like the wait time come back tomorrow or PAY FOR IT cocksuckers
,Chased911,2012-08-13T15:08Z,"Is this how the movie industry tries to incite people not to download? By having people paid 5$/hour to go online and say torrents are fakes and need passwords?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!

Idiots!"
,natedawg87,2012-08-13T15:57Z,"Piracy is here to stay.  If you want to try to convince people not to pirate/share files, at least be smart about what you say.  Saying that it is a password-protected rar file when we can click the link on top to see that it is an mp4 and a txt file just makes you look stupid and desperate.  I would be ashamed of yourselves.  Is this really the best these corporations can come up with?"
,piratiinho,2012-08-13T15:58Z,Thank you.
,ClickTPB,2012-08-13T16:11Z,"Ignore the retards saying this is fake. This is ettv, real shit. No password, legit file. "
,sony32,2012-08-13T17:32Z,Very clear copy ... download speed 500kb ... as for storyline ... gawd ... what a messed up ending ... and this show is on AMC ?? Comparing this to Dexter ... my wife feels when she watches Dexter it is like watching a train wreck but this show ... Man o Man ...  the violence is intense

,andrewIII,2012-08-13T21:58Z,"Dusted off my TPB account just to make this comment - there's no password for this torrent. However, I've downloaded ETTV Breaking Bad episodes which, in the past, have had passwords. I don't know why all of a sudden Breaking Bad torrents are so fucked, but this particular one is alright. Just sayin', a lot of these posts seem like bots(even though they happen to be right)."

,iCeDmeTeL,2012-08-14T07:24Z,"First of all thank you for the quality upload.  Second please, please proper uppercase filenames!  Yes i have OCD but i wouldn't bring this up if everyone else didn't release in identical filenames for neat storage.  Peace :3"

Instead of saying its fake in one world, describe what you are seeing, post a link to photobucket and the like. 

It's not helping anyone when half of the people are screaming fake and the other half calling them names."
