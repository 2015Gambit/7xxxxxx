Release Notes

For years one of the secret weapons used by Digital Juice
artists and animators has been our custom collection of
seamless textures. Now for the first time, we're letting
this treasure trove of possibilities leave home. If
you've ever looked at a blank canvas in Photoshop, After
Effects, or even in PowerPoint and not known what to do or
where to start, the more than 1000 super high-resolution
textures in the Texture Toolkit collection are designed
just for you. Delivered at a maximum resolution of
4000 x 4000 pixels, most of these textures are also
seamless in all directions and many have a built in alpha
so they can be layered on top of other images for unique
effects.
