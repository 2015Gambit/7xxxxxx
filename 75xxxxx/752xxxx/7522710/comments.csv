,Loopy27,2012-08-12T10:01Z,Great find! this album doesn't even drop till another week and a half! I wish it had the bonus track though cause thats my favorite song so far!
,redtar,2012-08-12T11:17Z,Is this legit?  Anyone know?
,ExecutioneRRRR,2012-08-12T11:57Z,"@Loopy27 
Yeah, it's a great album. Sorry I couldn't get the bonuses...We'll all just have to wait til we're meant to get them :P
@redtar
I guess you'll have to wait for someone to comment or just trust me and my upload? :P"
,redtar,2012-08-12T12:15Z,"Touche.  A clever fellow this ExecutionerRRRR is :P  Well, I suppose I may download and see how it goes lol"
,id8r,2012-08-13T16:34Z,"Hey ExecutioneRRRR, thanks a lot for the upload! :)"
,ExecutioneRRRR,2012-08-14T00:49Z,@id8r No problem! Hope you enjoy it!
,redtar,2012-08-14T09:56Z,"I'll confirm, it is legit.  Only 192 kbps, but good enough.  Nice upload thanks!"
,Neldor,2012-08-14T15:20Z,"Yes, it is legit. Its not 320 kbps, but who cares one week before release :)

There are 320 kbps versions of 'Shooting Star', 'Gold', 'Dementia', 'Good Time' and 'Take It All Away' on the internet, since they were released as single before.


Great job ExecutioneRRRR!
"
,ExecutioneRRRR,2012-08-15T14:40Z,"@redtar & @Neldor Thanks! Yeah, we'll all be able to pick up 320 soon! Plus the bonus tracks! So keen! hahaha"
