,xpmule,2012-08-11T03:13Z,"maybe stop uploading windows 8 cracks that don't work and that you havn't tested ?
Your just pissing people off and making yourself look like a fucking noob lol"
,xpmule,2012-08-11T16:40Z,"lol hilarious
after i posted this i come back later and you posted another torrent same thing but version 1.4 and that don't work and that too is getting people mad lol

Too many *new people are spamming the fuck out of TPB to build them selves a little reputation for praise and attention and i bet a million dollars some of them are the usual guys that occasionally have their torrents removed and account disabled and most of the rest are Demonoid releasers now trying to take over & get them selves a reputation of here.
But bear in mind TPB was already over crowded with a million people releasing the same thing at the same time 24hrs a day.
You'll never see another place with as man dupes and most uploaders can't see the search button.. it's invisible to them. Doesn't matter if its been up'd 15x before as long as you get some ass kissing lol

Procedure is simple download random crap everyone else already got. and then remove any trace of the releaser / group and source then upload torrent to TPB with your name in the title of course and say nothing when people think your a Uber L33T craccker (implying you are lol)

TPB never changes lol

Just bear in mind guys you may be jockeying for a noose ;)
Most of these kids have no clue how close they are to getting them selves jail time lol"
