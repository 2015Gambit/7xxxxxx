Mammo is a nickname given to Mehmooda Begum    
by her sisters. She marries a man from Lahore. 
After Partition, she and her husband           
automatically become Pakistani citizens.       
Although childless, her marriage is a happy    
one until her husband's death. Over property   
matters, Mammo is thrown out of the house by   
her relatives. She comes to India to stay      
with her only kin, her two sisters.            
Unable to extend her visa she has to go back - 
political priorities defeat humanitarian ones!
