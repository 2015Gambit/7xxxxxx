QC 47 - Electron Orbitals

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

The s,p,d & f electron orbitals (and their respective sub-orbitals energies) are explained along with their location in the elemental nuclei.

The mystery behind the motion of electrons in atomic nuclei (which were previously described as electron probability clouds) is solved and the true motion of bound electrons of all energies in the atomic nucleus is revealed for the first time.

The forty -seventh chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
