,zfantasy,2012-08-14T08:50Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE. This is the movie ""WALK THE LINE"". What a bunch of douches. Feeling pity for so many seeders. They have hidden the file extension just to prevent your P2P client from showing screenshots or playing pre-download sample of the file. Do not download if you are asking for what the name of file says."
