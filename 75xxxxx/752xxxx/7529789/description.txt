MISSION MAGIC, an early-'70s cartoon that aired on Saturday mornings between 1973 and 1975, featured time traveling kids and Rick Springfield (who had already had a chart hit in the U.S. with Speak to the Sky in 1972) starring as himself. It was a forgettable piece of fluff that would be forgotten entirely except for Springfield's future stardom and the album made up of songs he would perform at the end of each episode. This great lost treasure of '70s pop was unearthed in 2009 on a reissue featuring Springfield's aforementioned hit. MISSION MAGIC, originally released in 1974, is actually a pretty magical piece of bubblegummy goodness. Unlike the usual procedures for an album like this, Springfield wrote all the songs on the MISSION MAGIC soundtrack, and he proves quite adept at cranking out hooky, fun, and simple tunes that won't tax your brain but will leave you feeling good.
