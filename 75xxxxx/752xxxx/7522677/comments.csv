,M_i_G,2012-08-12T00:18Z,did u follow Installation Process??? patch should be in the folder with the program.
,xteen94,2012-08-12T01:19Z,"Yes, I've done everything based on the installation guide. I still can't use it. Where should I install it? By default, it installs at 'program files(x86)/internet download manager' Every time I was going to patch it, the patch-er says that it can't find the IDM."
