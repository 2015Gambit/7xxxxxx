The tutorial details how to set up a computer to accept a remote desktop connection and how to connect to that computer using the remote desktop connection on another computer. It is important to note that the computer you will be connecting to must have Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Business or Windows Vista Ultimate. The computer you will be connecting from can have any of these versions or a home version of Windows. This tutorial shows how to use remote desktop over your home network. I do not show you how to use remote desktop to connect to a machine that is not connected to your home network.
