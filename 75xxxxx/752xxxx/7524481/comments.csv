,tibird,2012-08-12T20:43Z,yes it is in german but you have to understand that nobody is upping the english version. so everybody is very frustrated with that. the americans suck at making these videos available. I appreciate your efforts though. Your one of the few people who cared enough to even try to up these videos. so thanks again. the olympics are over for another 2 yrs until the winter olympics. hope to see you then.   :)
