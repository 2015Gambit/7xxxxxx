    Firestarter is set in the near future, in the year 2010. A malicious 
    virus has infected a virtual reality machine, the FireStarter. The 
    intruding program has caused the computer to malfunction. The rules 
    of the simulation have been altered in a potentially deadly manner, 
    with the player's consciousness trapped inside. There is only one 
    possible way to escape, by completing the game within a period of 48 
    virtual hours. The penalty for failing to do so is the ultimate one - 
    real death.
