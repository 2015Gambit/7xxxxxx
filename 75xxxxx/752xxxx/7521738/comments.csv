,KawaiHentai,2012-08-17T22:09Z,"@pirateman1283 Sorry man, an uncensored version doesn't exist. Only if its licensed by a foreign studio to dub it, then that's the only way these series are gonna have an uncensored release."
,pirateman1283,2012-08-19T05:26Z,thanks for the info. That's crazy to learn. Do you have anything like oni-tensei? 
,KawaiHentai,2012-08-19T07:47Z,@pirateman1283 First time I hear of these series. So I don't know what's similar to it. Do you have any requests? If you've got questions don't hesitate to go on out Facebook page to ask.
