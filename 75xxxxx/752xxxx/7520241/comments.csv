,KBXX,2012-08-10T14:45Z,"would this work for a ps3?? i thought ps3 is the only platform where only orignals work....
if it does....how would it work? just burning it on a blu-ray disk??"
[V],boobsman,2012-08-10T16:35Z,"@ KBXX you need custom firmware so that you can play these files directly off your hard drive, no burning required."
,CrazyFilmmaker,2012-08-10T21:24Z,Hi @boobsman can you please upload Call.of.Duty.Modern.Warfare.3.PROPER.PS3-DUPLEX ! can't find it anywhere! :)
,Clownman1,2012-08-10T22:30Z,"Thanks boobssman! Your uploads are indeed noted :)

CrazyFilmmaker: google that release name, there is a torrent over at KAT"
,CrazyFilmmaker,2012-08-10T23:24Z,"@Clownman1 yes, i know, but download speed is only about 20kb/s :( "
,KBXX,2012-08-12T13:01Z,"@boobsman .firt of all, i love your name....
 i am new to this stuff....just got a ps3 a week back..,so if u could tell me a lil more about the custom firmware ...anywhere i can download it from or any other thing....
THANK YOU :)"
,blizuntochronic,2012-08-12T20:59Z,Thanks for the upload - but this game wont work on CFW because it requires firmware 4.11 - hopefully a fix will be released at some point
,dududus,2012-08-13T21:32Z,expect a fix in about 3 weeks guys when we have the 4.21 public keys
,ziarka,2012-08-14T06:30Z,The game is actually runnable if you use 4.11 DEX CFW. You're just running the risk of bricking your console if you are not on it yet. 
,iamhelix,2012-08-15T12:42Z,"lol, yeah burn it to a blue ray and shove it in your ps3 it will work.

Come on are you that stupid? do you think sony would make it that easy.

,SceneModz,2012-08-15T16:54Z,"The only way and easiest way to play all the new games is by using ""True Blue"" dongle.Trust me its the only way for guys using 3.55 jailbreak to run 3.55 and up games.This game and Darksiders 2 will have True Blue eboots real soon last eboot fixes were Max Payne and Ghost Recon.

So yes this game will be playable this month on PS3 just get you a ""True Blue"" Dongle and quit waiting for a 4.11 jailbreak that will never come while you miss out.The 3.66 keys were recently leaked so alot of games are coming for 3.55 cfw but True Blue is still way ahead of 3.66."
,dgrayman13,2012-08-15T20:19Z,"Don't listen to SceneModz. He is just another lame promoter of that turd true blue. He commented today and if you were under a rock, today team Duplex actually removed the drm from true blue. There is an eboot that works on 3.55 for max payne 3 right now. Wait a few days or weeks and you won't need to pay an arm and a leg to china."
,snoobler4loof,2012-08-16T00:07Z,"So does a DVD R disc work? Also just download it, burn it to the DVD R disc and install on ps3? Please reply. Also the update. 4.11? What's the current version for ps3. pleaes reply thanks "
,mandruf,2012-08-16T02:06Z,"DO NOT BUY TRUE BLUE.
Those scums made money on the scene with some shit DRM dongle while all this should have been free to the scene all the time. Now DUPLEX broke their DRM and releasing the EBOOTs for free. And no, they're not chinese, they're Indonesians. No wonder they didn't hesitate one second to screw everyone over this, those little rats. Not only their culture sucks, but their country is a rat hole full of gays and little bitches like the TB team ready to scam you over some DRM shit."
,retx,2012-08-18T03:33Z,"Lmao! Lightake is already refunding money because they couldn't release the new true blue. It's stupid to buy true blue now since there is dex, e3, and duplex to the rescue."
,LeoCYH,2012-08-18T07:54Z,Hey I'm new to PS3 jailbreaking can someone tell me what is dex and eboot?
,checkinboarder3,2012-08-20T07:36Z,"LeoCYH: DEX is Debug Mode PS3.
As far as I understand, CEX is the regular PS3 we all have and DEX is for devs.
Since a while ago (month?) there is a simple way to convert a CEX 3.55 cfw console to DEX 4.x, so you can play games like this one (I still don't know if it requires a special EBOOT).
Now, since a few weeks ago the keys to 3.6 fw were found so teams have been releasing patches for 3.6 fw games (circa 2011).
AND, Duplex just fucked up TruBlue DRM (which means they are nothing but people against the scene charging for stuff that should be free) so there is no need for that turd as somebody said before me.

So if you are on 3.55 ofw, you can put cfw (kmeaw) and play all 3.55 enabled games, plus the new ones cracked on 3.66, PLUS the ones with trublue whose patches have been released these days.

AND if you have an original game, you can upgrade to DEX 4.x and play it regularly, or play backups that have released an update (like sleeping dogs), or downgrade to 3.55 DEX to play the old ones (not sure if this last one is required to play 3.55 games).

There is a lot but that's the easy rundown and google is your best friend."

,LeoCYH,2012-08-20T15:00Z,@checkinboarder3 too bad I'm on 4.20 ofw now
,LeoCYH,2012-08-20T15:00Z,But I still want to know about these things.
,jmuckey2,2012-08-21T05:38Z,you need to convert your ps3 to  dex and install 4.11 or higher and use bdemu google is your friend 
,homdizz,2012-08-24T04:30Z,how do i get this on to my ps3?
,retx,2012-08-26T14:52Z,This game is awesome! Can't wait for it to get cracked for 3.55 users.
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-08-28T03:30Z,"People are funny, so much complaining for a ÂŁ40/ÂŁ50 pound dongle (true blue)that gives you all the newest games for free. I have been very happy with it, I have been playing the latest games while you guys keep waiting for patches. Skyrim alone was worth the price of the dongle back when I bought it last year, let alone all the games I have working now. It is the easiest way to play the newest games, just download games that are true blue ready/enabled, and it is that simple."
,retx,2012-08-29T03:52Z,According to rumors the new tb and its eboots won't support the old tb dongle. I also wanted to buy a TB but bought a ps3 move package instead. I'm really glad right now that I didn't choose TB. Waiting really did pay off.
,ivan00z,2012-09-01T22:49Z,"It's not the price of tb people are fed up with, it's the funding through their sales. As opposed to honest devs who require patience and may also need a fraction of the funding a tb dongle would cost to get more hardware to work with or for motivation. I personally would rather get a 360 for cheap and mod it than give the tb team anything and that's what i did after all if tb's support was directed to the real dev's throughout the last year things would be different.

Don't waste your $ by encouraging the tb team. At this point it's only a matter of time before it's obsolete anyway."
