The VicTorV live footage of Carnifex from 2010. If you want to check it out before you download it..it's on YouTube:
I downloaded it from YouTube as well. It's 720p .MP4 format.
Scott sounds fucking awesome.
Shawn however...ehh..some say he's just REALLY sloppy..others say his triggers were screwing up..either way..the drums kind of kill the epicness of this entire show. :/ But it's the best quality footage of Carnifex live. Enjoy.
