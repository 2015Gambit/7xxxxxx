Episode 2 : Tarantulas

The Tarantula has prowled the Earth for some three hundred and fifty million years. A big spider, it's famous for its big teeth which inject paralyzing venom into prey.

They are tough predators and one species has been known to kill birds and raid nests, even South America's most dreaded Pit Viper isn't safe. But Tarantulas have enemies as well and although they take refuge in deep burrows, they are sometimes discovered and ferreted out.

This detailed programme introduces us to numerous species of Tarantulas to prove that they are not dangerous to man and that their private lives are worthy of fascination not revulsion.
