,thinkgeek,2012-08-12T08:31Z,thx for the upload. good quality.. but album sux IMO nothing like planetary duality.. micheal keene ruins it with his love to hear the sound of his own voice
,diminisheddarknut,2012-08-12T21:05Z,THANK YOU FOR SEEDING
,masterkeef42o,2012-08-12T22:26Z,"yeah, lots of singing.. at first i was like ""hm, not bad"" but then it kept happening in every song.. and in the past his singing wasnt very enjoyable at concerts :/"
,Treatz17,2012-08-17T01:02Z,This album is definitely disappointing.
