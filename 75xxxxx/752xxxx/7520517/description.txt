Plot
   In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 
districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each 
district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part 
entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games 
are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate 
their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-
year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female 
representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male 
counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives who have 
trained for this their whole lives.
