,jfsdo3242,2012-08-15T17:04Z,"this torrent works great. files come as .rar files (30 of them), and you don't need a password to un-RAR them. the videos themselves are of GOOD quality, but not the h264 HD quality we've grown accustomed to (like in Kaplan Comprehensive PRep Step 1 2010 edition). But i think its still great and i certainly will be using this for Step 2 prep. 

STAY ON and SEED THIS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL"
,jignesh04,2012-08-16T19:52Z,Thanks So Much!
,kamrananvaar,2012-08-17T11:16Z,"would have been better if not rared 

which one has 
cardiovascular 1.mp4 
or do i have to dwnld all extract them"
,894567,2012-08-21T15:57Z,This file set is not complete. All the .rar files contain the same set of incomplete videos. Is this a trap?
,rayquest9,2012-08-27T22:54Z,is this working
,Catarro1,2012-09-01T00:36Z,Everything works fine.
,Medical.Torrents,2012-09-04T11:51Z,"The files unrared without a glitch. All the videos that were extracted also work. Two are missing from the series, though- Basics of Critical Care and Surgery and Preventative Medicine (I compared the course packet and the videos).

@ Catarro1- Great upkoad. Thanks. "
,Medical.Torrents,2012-09-04T11:57Z,"@ 894567.  I have no idea what you are trying to say. All the videos worked, and ran until the end of the lecture. I have just started it, but; after a quick look at a handful of the videos; they all seem different"
