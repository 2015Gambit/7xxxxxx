As with most Silver-Bootlegs, dates and venues might not be those that are written 
on the artwork or the CDs themselves. I always do my best to give good information, 
but I sometimes just can┬┤t guarantee. 

So, please make sure to update the new information that may be given during the 
presence on the trackers where I have uploaded these shows. You should always find 
the best suggestion about dates and venues in the threads themselves, save them in 
a NEW info-file not to spread wrong details about the shows.

However, many thanks to all those users and collectors that help to work out the 
proper details.


Do not sell this recording.
