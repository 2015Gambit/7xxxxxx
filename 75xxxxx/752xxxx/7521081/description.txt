WhoCares, full title Ian Gillan & Tony Iommi: WhoCares is a music project by Ian Gillan and Tony Iommi and a charity release by the supergroup WhoCares they had formed with the help of other musicians, to raise money to rebuild a music school in Gyumri, Armenia after the destruction of the city in the 1988 earthquake in Armenia.
 
In addition to Ian Gillan (of Deep Purple) and Tony Iommi (of Black Sabbath), many artists took part in the charity music project including Jon Lord (of Deep Purple), Jason Newsted (of Metallica), Nicko McBrain (of Iron Maiden) and Mikko "Linde" Lindstr√∂m (of HIM).
 
The album was picked by many rock critics as a "collectors item" because of the vintage classic songs it contains. The album was released on 13 July 2012 in Europe and scheduled for release in North American markets on 28 August 2012.
 
In addition to the 2-track single "Out of My Mind / Holy Water" released in 2011, the 2-CD album contains in addition to already recorded classic rock materials from various bands, a lot of rarities and unreleased material as well.
