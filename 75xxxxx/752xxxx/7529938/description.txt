Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, August 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Sherry Peel Jackson, the former IRS agent who was imprisoned for the crime of not filing federal income tax forms after she questioned in 2001 if she had to pay the government. Ron Paul became involved in her case after it was reported that Peel Jackson was not receiving proper medical care in prison. Earlier this month, she completed her probation and is now free of the federal government's industrial-prison complex. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including yet another large ammunition purchase by the federal government and mega-banks preparing for imminent financial collapse.
