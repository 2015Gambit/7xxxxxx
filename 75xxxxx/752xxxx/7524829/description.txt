Wes Montgomery was a natural musical talent.  It is commonly believed that he never 

took lessons/completely self taught.  True or not Wes Montgomery is pretty much 

worshipped by other jazz guitarists.  He eschewed the pick/plectrum, preferring to 

use his thumb.  This gave him an extraordinary smooth attack....somewhat like Pat 

Metheney, but I'm quite sure Pat uses a pick.  Pat's birthday tomorrow August 12.
