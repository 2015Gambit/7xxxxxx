EarthView supports different maps that show our planet earth in different ways, like photographic or artistic. Many options allow total customization of all view parameters. EarthView has won many awards for its absolutely breathtaking images.
	

EarthView supports four different beautiful maps of the earth, starting at 10 km resolution, which means that at 100% zoom level, 1 pixel on your screen equals 10 kilometers on earth. If you purchase the full version, you'll get the possibility to download even more detailed versions of some maps, which have higher resolution. This means, they have much more detail, so you can zoom in even further!


The demo of EarthView comes with the first map - all others can be downloaded from the Maps page.
