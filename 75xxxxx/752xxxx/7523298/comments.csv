How come no one will block this jenkey1002 in every file that he upload is Trojan horse virus. Why no one post any virus scans why this guy is still allowed to post this virused crap? I wish I could have unlocked time of gameplay from 5 mins to 15 but I don't want to download another virused file from jenkey while every antyvirus show that it's trojan horse inside."
,skickahit10,2012-08-11T17:57Z,"there's no virus in it, just a ""false positive""."
,SlappyPwnsAss,2012-08-11T19:40Z,"its not a virus dumbass -.- ive downloaded his 50 team patch and it said it was a virus, but it wasnt... im using that patch on my demo"
,Mopsteras,2012-08-11T21:34Z,lol yes it is a virus and you are false profile scammers. Then tell me why skickahit10 upload  the files with his anonymous account and give passwords for the rar in other downloads unless to upload it with his main account? You are retarded I hope no one will trick on your false account little rookie. Scan it with antyvirus someone it's not clear.
,skickahit10,2012-08-12T04:23Z,it's literary thousands of people using Jenkey's patches....you don't think anyone would have rung the bell by now if he was spreading virus? Use some common sense dude.
