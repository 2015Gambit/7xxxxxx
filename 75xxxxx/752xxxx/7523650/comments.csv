Instructions
=========
1. Uninstall any installs of bitdefender, and clean up files.
2. Install Bitdefender Internet Security 2013, and log into mybitdefender.
     (It will ask to download updates during install, DON'T let it).
3. IMPORTANT. Make sure to verify your FAKE e-mail address, and that it
    shows your computer's name in the my bitdefender dashboard web page.
    (If crack says to check bitdefender account, make sure it says PC name
     on the web page.)
4. Boot into Safe Mode with networking.
5. Run crack, choose language, and install.
6. Reboot and update. 365 days!

IT WORKS WOW"
,muniap,2012-08-13T14:13Z,"Downloaded trial version of total .. you know. Created account but never got mail from bitdef to activate it. Seems activated though. Shows my pc with correct name. At safe mode with networking beta 3 and beta 4 says you don' t have account. Uninstalled, ran beta 4 in normal mode, said it cleaned all, started again installed trial, reboot in safe mode with networking but same thing. You don't have account. What am i doing wrong here?"
,watchdogy,2012-08-13T23:28Z,@muniap you must activate using a legit account then open your mailbox for that account and then accept the link and open it it say and show your pc.....i took me a while or 5 mins so to figure it out you must open the bit defender and open my account on the top of windows and accept from there link my account and if this works well the u are good to go....the use step 4-5-6.............TADA it works all updates good
,ThCxProToTypE,2012-08-15T19:20Z,"This did not work for me. I did exactly as the instructions stated. But when I go into safe mode with networking and run the patch all it says is I need to be logged in to my bitdefender, which I was. And yes, I did verify my email.

I don't know what's up but I am just going to try a different anti-virus application."

,the_wuggles,2012-08-16T04:32Z,"@ThCxProToTypE

When you go into the dashboard on Bitdefender's website, not the program, does your computer show up as a 30 day trial? That could be it, I had the same problem. I went in, played around on the site, and it finally came up. Then i booted into safe mode and it worked."
,rdefrancisco2310,2012-08-16T20:30Z,"@the_wuggles @ThCxProToTypE I don't think it has anything to do with the 30 day trial that comes up on the website (It's showing for me and mine is working). Just make sure your computer name/workgroup appears on the bottom of the Dashboard (the homepage for your mybitdefender profile). Once that came up, I ran the crack on 'Safe Mode w/ Networking' and voila! "
