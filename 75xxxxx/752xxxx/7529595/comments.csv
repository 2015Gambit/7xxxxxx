I hate to be repetitious on such a sensitive subject. But is itb possible for you and your team to, please, upload the Olympics MountanBike Men/Women which was rinnung this WeekEnd.

I know I am insisting, and that it might... bother you. But, just like a ton of XCountry addict all over the world, we are looking for this nice piece of Sport and no-one put it on torrent anywhere.
We are counting on your consistent skills to upload such a stuff.

Please Please Please (It seems I'm near pretty near to beg...)."
