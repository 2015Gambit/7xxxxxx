""After I buy this pack, when will I have access to the guns?

    Once the Firefight Pack has been downloaded, players will be able to access the new guns the next time they open their locker.""

based on this information I can't see how this ""fix"" is in any way the legit way of using the DLC since the guns are supposed to be sitting in your locker and not for purchase from a shop. It seems like more of a mod or hack workaround than anything."
