Mass Effect 3 Unlocker
======================

1) This is a modified Coalesced.bin that unlocks you all dlc weapons and armor, Collector Rifle, Resurgence dlc weapons (If installed) and Firefight.

2) To install it you need to paste this file in the following direction:
"(...)Mass Effect 3BIOGameCookedPCConsole"

3) To unlock the pre-order weapons and armor press F12 while you play, don't do it in the middle of a mission: Shepard will replace all his weapons with the ones you've just unlocked.

4) You can buy the weapons from Resurgence and Firefight in the Spectre Terminal.

BUG
===
Once you buy any weapon of FIrefight or Resurgence, a better version will be avaiable to buy in the Spectre Terminal.
DON'T BUY IT!!!! It's price is incorrect, to upgrade your weapon, go to the upgrade terminal so you can purchase it at it's correct price.
