This book give the practically knowledge for understand the topics. This text is very good because it has clearly knowledge about Computer Organization and Architecture and also help to understand the topics. This text on digital signal processing and digital filter theory for seniors and graduate students, it presents the most current information available with computer-oriented projects integrated throughout. With up-to-date coverage of modern architectural approaches, this handbook provides a thorough discussion of the fundamentals of computer organization and architecture, as well as the critical role of performance in driving computer design. Captures the fielders’ continued innovations and improvements, with input from active practitioners. Reviews the two most prevalent approaches: superscalar, which has come to dominate the microprocessor design field, including the widely used Pentium; and EPIC, seen in the IA-64 architecture of Intel's Itanium. Views systems from both the architectural and organizational perspectives. Includes coverage of critical topics, such as bus organization, computer arithmetic, I/O modules, RISC, memory, and parallel processors.
