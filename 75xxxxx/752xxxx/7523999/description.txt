In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews Michael "Mish" Shedlock from the widely read MISHΓÇÖS Global Economic Trend Analysis. He talks about the bankruptcy of many municipalities across America and the role of banking fraud in that.

Mish is an investment advisor at Sitka Pacific Capital.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an
