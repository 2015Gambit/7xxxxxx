First, man, you are awsome, you provide a lot of games and apps, for free, and working. I admire you.
I play this game, Amazing spiderman, but wifi doesn't work in my room, can you set it to work without internet connection? It would be great. 
This works good, sometimes there's a bit of lag, but it's ok. So, don't stop, and if you can do a offline working version.
If you need: i have an android tablet 4.0 ICS, 1gb ram, cpu A10, Cortex A8/1,2GHz, and gpu Mali 400 MP, 4 CORE. 
Thank you ;) !"
