Let me know if you find anything fishy and I'll delete it at once but I've been playing it for sometime now and didn't have any weird issues with the computer and the game plays perfectly fine.

Also, since not many read the torrent info, remember to select just the zip file or the extracted files for the game in order to avoid downloading both. Zip is about 50mbs and extracted it's about 90mb.

Have fun!"
