Age of Empires with Rise of Rome Expansion Res Fixed working per 

This is the version that I had got from Piratebay sometime ago which does not seem to be seeded anymore.

The graphics glitches with the menu are fixed and the whole game works perfectly.


I had uploaded files with another username before but it seems that either the account is deleted or I just can't remember my info.


Scanned thoroughly and it is clean and works great but of course do keep your antivirus running to scan since you shouldn't be taking my word for it.

I have also included the zip version which is smaller for those who want to download it quickly make sure to select only the zip file to download (50mb instead of 90mbs)

I will seed this on a very high speed server for as many years as I can.

Have fun and enjoy!
