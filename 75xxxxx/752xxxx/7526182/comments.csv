Keygen no longer works for me. I get ""Improper registration code"". I think they're using the same keygen for the different versions of Wondershare here. 

From what I've read from other users, After your registration pulls through, you should start blocking WSHELPER.exe because it the one which detects if you have an original copy.

Is there a workaround for users like me? another keygen perhaps?"

info will be much apprecitated."
,vikram1,2012-09-03T02:23Z,Update. found wshelp.exe. blocked it in advanced firewall settings. but to no avail. Also edited the hosts file but that does'nt work either.
