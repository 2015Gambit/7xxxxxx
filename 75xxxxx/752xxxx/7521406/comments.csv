,JerombaCZ,2012-08-11T06:12Z,"changelog - basic game didn't work for me, this update fixed it"
,elDunge,2012-08-11T18:50Z,"Skirdow write ""No Idea!"" more than half of the time. Still, I never download anything not from a trusted uploader"
,LuxiusDK,2012-08-11T20:27Z,"I downloaded this + the core game (Skidrow release), applied the patch (Update 1) immediately after installing the game, but I didn't copy the cracked files from the core game - I shouldn't right?
Still, I have some terrible bugs trying to load a game (opens multiplayer lobby and shit), just wondering if you are having the same problem?"
,thxforthehelp2,2012-08-12T05:10Z,@LuxiusDK Sadly the game was released in a bad build it would appear to be another SOTS
,Timbo6669,2012-08-12T08:16Z,"yeah, but did you install all the updates with SOTS? cause once all patches were installed it is a GREAT game..yeah it took 13-14 updates but hey....SHIT HAPPENS!! ppl make mistakes dude.even dev's...thats a universal rule throughout, well, the universe..."
,nozo123,2012-08-12T10:41Z,@Timbo6669 Actually STOS have until now 59 patches relesed LOL
,LuxiusDK,2012-08-12T10:47Z,Are you guys talking about official patches? The retail version? Game looks like it has potential (I miss the MOO games) - but I don't buy bugged games. It's a matter of principle.
,VegitoDBZ,2012-08-12T12:23Z,"SOTS wasa fun game, don't compare it to this pile of shit"
,LuxiusDK,2012-08-13T08:22Z,"Ah, you mean Sword of the Stars! What a waste of time. But I will have to agree, this game (LoP) is not worth three rounds of game time, if it's not working as intended."
,EndlessRampage2142,2012-08-13T21:39Z,"This is what it updates
