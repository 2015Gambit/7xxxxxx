                          Afghanada Vol. 03
---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Three Canadian soldiers have been shipped out to Afghanistan and
are based deep in the heart of the conflict: Kandahar Province,
where the Taliban insurgency is fiercest. Every day, Canadian
soldiers on the ground confront the chaos and violence of life
"outside the wire". They donâ€™t have the big picture; theyâ€™re not
interested in the policy. Theyâ€™re just trying to help the people,
protect each other...and survive.

Afghanada gives us a gruntsâ€™-eye-view of the conflict . The sound
is edgy and gritty, the impact immediate, pushing the listener into
an auditory journey that is impossible to escape. It is a
reflection of the very real situation Canadian soldiers are facing
every day in Afghanistan.
