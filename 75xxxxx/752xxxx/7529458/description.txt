     Stars: Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and Dana Delany

   

    Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn star in this hilarious romantic comedy about
    the consequences of "stretching" the truth. When architect Newton Davis'
    girlfriend Becky (Dana Delany) turns down his marriage proposal, his
    newly-built dream house suddenly becomes nothing more than an empty monument
    to her rejection. That is, until a chance encounter with Gwen (Hawn) turns
    his life upside-down.

    Intrigued by Newton's story, Gwen visits the house and decides to move in
    on her own. Resourceful and creative, Gwen is soon fixing up the house
    and charming Newton's family and neighbors-all the while passing herself
    off as his new wife! Gwen even befriends Becky, who begins to see a Newton
    she never knew existed.

    Horrified at the deception yet unable to stop it, Newton finds himself
    playing along with her prepostterous stories, her attempts at reconciling
    differences within his family and her campaign for his promotion at work.
    Finally he convinces Gwen to fabricate their "divorce" so he can still
    get married to Becky- until he has a change of heart.
