Wiener and Pinson introduce each of the major data structures with supporting, GUI-based laboratory programs designed to reinforce the basic concepts and principles. These laboratories allow the reader to explore and experiment with the properties of each data structure. All source code for the laboratories is available on the Web. By integrating the principles of OOP and GUI programming, this unique book presents the fundamental issues of data structures within the context of paradigms that are essential to today's professional software developer. The text assumes only an elementary understanding of Java and no experience with OOP.
