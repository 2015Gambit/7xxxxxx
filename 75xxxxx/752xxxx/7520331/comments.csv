,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-11T03:07Z,"Great another movie with feminine males and women who like to control every aspect of a relationship. Sorry but the name of this movie should be ""Think like a Man who Thinks like a Woman"""
,MoviesR101,2012-08-11T17:23Z,"Thanks for the up!

@ B.Torrents - The clowns that work at IMDB are complete Idiots! They judge movies before they watch them! I judge movies after I have seen them, not what someone else thinks!
Hilarious movie! A must see!
