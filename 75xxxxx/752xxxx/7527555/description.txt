Evoking some of the most renowned Czech films of the sixties — Closely Watched Trains in particular — Lunák weaves a spell around his tale of Alois, a middle-aged dispatcher who works at a small railway station in the Sudeten, the mountainous region along the Czech borders with Germany and Poland. It is 1989, and the radio is full of news of border crossings in Berlin as the wall starts to come down. Alois, shuffling around the station, his face grim, looks as if he has seen it all — little excites him. He is used to solitude and getting on with life. But as fog and rain swirl around the station, he finds himself haunted by the past, especially the events at the end of the Second World War. Tortured by these memories, he ends up in a sanatorium. When he is released, he finds that the world has changed: the communist regime has evaporated, and so has his job. But hope arrives in the miraculous form of a woman.
