,sinful1212,2012-08-13T03:51Z,"@S3r4ch You are obviously new here But I'm pretty sure some one has already told you this, if it's a green skull it will not be fake. So there is no point in making nonsensical posts saying ""this better be real""."

,nikolis123,2012-08-13T12:29Z,So when an account has a skull that means that they only have movies with good quality or what cuz no1 comments about a|v rate when there's a skull. can some1 tell what that means. (the skull)
,Kiriyama87,2012-08-13T14:13Z,"@nokolis

a skull means that the uploader is a trustworthy VIP."
,Rush,2012-08-13T20:32Z,"@S3r4ch ,,,,, you freakin troll, this is the second comment you have written dissing a green skull uploader. 

s4a should have your troglodyte miscreant troll ass booted from the site.

If your just to dumb to understand what a green skull is, please do us a favor have no children

If you happen to be a MPAA shill, Fuck You and deal with it. "

A typical shitty love movie.  I would've watched in high-school if i was trying to get laid.

A/V is there for a BR-Rip."
,ironymon,2012-08-14T13:30Z,"Majority who comes back from shit holes like iraq and who knows where either break down mentally or not, the guy in this movie totally broke in his head lol... kudos to guys in the army who will serve it till they die, by a bullet or natural causes. You are UNBREAKABLE!"

,Goonah,2012-08-17T04:37Z,"Hahahaha. Why is this movie so gay? Is love gay? If so, I feel bad for you bitches. 

The faggots who is rating love movies, like this;

Feel for you guys, all of you shooks out there."

,aradiel,2012-08-18T05:10Z,"You just described every Hollywood romance movie ever made, baratbatpo."
,skyvillage,2012-08-18T12:29Z,"Kind of strange how you kids these days think a sappy romance between a man and a woman is ""gay""--it may be a lot of things, but one thing it ain't is ""gay""--and that makes me wonder about YOU"
,kolot182,2012-08-18T13:24Z,i don't wanna download this movie but my girlfriend wants it so i have no choice! haha..
,milkster1984,2012-08-18T15:34Z,"Whats going on with the seeders? currently stuck on 19.6%, never seen the download rate go higher than 20 kB/s"
,ihavesmellyballs,2012-08-19T00:16Z,"skyvillage its time. You may come out of the closet now. Skyvillage is just as gay as this movie. Skyvillage cried watching this and when someone littered the other day. Quit trying to push your weirdo hippie ways on us. Yes, you may smell my balls."
,dsoumelr,2012-08-19T10:49Z,thnx amillion fr the upload
,Tinna_30,2012-08-19T18:30Z,Thanks!
,ciropabon,2012-08-20T16:03Z,"There are no weirdo hippies, only cool ones. Hippies hate romantic movies, smelly balls and people that writes comments in TPB threads. SmellyAbsentBalls is pointing to the fact that USA is a matriarchy, SkyDumbVillage, and its movies show that. Men life is defined by subjecting themselves to the fancies those bitches ask from them. The comment by kolot182 shows the same thing: American has no balls at all, smelly or not. If they smell something they are their external ovaries."
,Dufox,2012-08-23T08:22Z,"@ciropabon

not sure if your trolling or ur just ignorant enough to think you sound smart."
,YardBoy,2012-08-24T07:37Z,"+1 to the UL'er and SkyVillage who sees the knuckle-draggers for what they are.  Re-seeded 4.87X.  You?  

A9/V9.  A good chick flick with a story pertinent to the times."
,Harakiri_,2012-08-24T23:30Z,Super shit movie from gayland
,Phatfish,2012-08-27T07:23Z,"@skyvillage:

You have the word ""village"" in his profile name.
Your argument is clearly irreverent. "
,slanx,2012-08-31T10:15Z,This had better be porno.
,slanx,2012-08-31T10:16Z,I think you mean irrelevant.
,KingMoa212,2012-09-01T00:31Z,smellyballs.. you are too low class and your nick name and comments are smelling like you!
,Movie_Buff84,2012-09-02T10:47Z,scene4all how can I download this file without the subtitles?
,Movie_Buff84,2012-09-03T01:30Z,"Someone please tell me how you can take off the subs.....
Thanks"
,Radiola18,2012-09-04T12:43Z,Great movie ! thanks for share 
,jnastyy7,2012-09-04T20:41Z,"A:9/V:9

M:3 - Girlfriend wanted to see it so I downloaded. First hour of the movie could have been condensed to 10 minutes. Efron's acting is stale. Major holes in plot. Not sure how anyone could thoroughly enjoy this movie simply because of its explicit predictability. Girlfriend even thought it was boring.

Download The Vow if you're trying to get lucky. At least it'll keep you awake long enough to attempt to get some tonight."

,bmacedo,2012-09-06T16:31Z,I agree the movie wasn't great but I will say that the book by Nicholas Sparks ten times better!
