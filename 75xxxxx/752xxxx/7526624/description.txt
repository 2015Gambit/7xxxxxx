This is the song in the New Starship Troopers: Invasion movie.
Boom Boom Satellite are Japanese Electronic Rockers?  I have no idea, I loved the tune, even though it was outside of my Genre of music.

I looked everywhere for the song... and Couldn't find it... As it is NEW (as of the time of this torrents creation).

It is nothing fancy!  So please don't complain about the quality.

I ripped a WAV file from the movie Which I downloaded here on TPB - and then I converted it to a 320bps MP3.

Sounds good enough - IF one of you knows where a better copy is!  Please put it in the comments to direct traffic there.

Hope this'll do for now!

   *Oh and this is my first torrent and first mp3 ripped...
