Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, August 10 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Dave Krieger in-studio. Mr. Krieger is a former radio news reporter, news director, television news reporter and anchorman and investigative journalist who won national and state news awards from Associated Press Broadcasters. He is the author of Clouded Titles, a book exposing the mortgage scandal created by the banksters that has affected millions of Americans. The book informs readers about foreclosure defense, strategic default, quiet title actions and county land record functions.

Alex also talks with "Syrian Girl," who continues to report on the real situation in Syria, the latest target of the global elite as they move to take down adversaries and create order out of chaos. 

Also, Alex airs video and audio he shot on his way to work today after spotting the testing of a drone by a drone operator in Austin, TX.
