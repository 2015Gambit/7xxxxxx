-Game Description:
 As in the original Pac-Man arcade game, the basic objective of each level is to guide Pac-Man through a maze while eating dots, unique food items, and power pellets that make Pac-Man's enemies, the ghosts, edible for a limited time. Some levels contain obstacles such as deadly boulders, animals who delay or kill Pac-Man, and explosive projectiles. After every few rounds there is a bonus mini-game in which the player can obtain some extra points (with every 50,000 points earning Pac-Man an extra life). The levels also feature a variety of shapes and architectural features such as cylindrical mazes, canopies, bridges, pyramids, and even walls that allow Pac-Man to walk vertically. The game features more sophisticated events than its arcade predecessor, such as collecting a certain number of pellets to unlock another area of a maze. The game also includes the ability to see the short intermission videos that come before a new level and allow for an option of non-storyline play on specific levels. The game also has the ability to connect over the Internet for multiplayer mini-games.
