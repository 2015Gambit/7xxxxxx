Seven new weapons for use in the single-player campaign are included in the pack. Gamers who have been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer will be familiar with five of the weapons. They include the Indra and Krysae sniper rifles, Reegar Carbine, Harrier battle rifle, and Geth SMG.

Two completely new weapons are also included in the pack. The all-new Blood Pack Punisher SMG is a sub-machine gun with a second barrel that fires off a round whenever a main barrel burst is fired to take down enemy armor. The Adas Anti-Synthetic Assault Rifle is an electricity-based gun that will help take down robots or enemy shields.
