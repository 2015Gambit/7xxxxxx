Subjects of jokes are based mostly on comparing current technology to the way we'd do things growing up in the past. He also talks about more personal subjects such as his battle with cancer and his hit MTV show simply named "The Tom Green Show." He also brings back some classic comedy from his own past with references to Freddy Got Fingered and various other movie appearances.
