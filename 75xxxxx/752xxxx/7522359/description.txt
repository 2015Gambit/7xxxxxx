QC 54 - Allotropes & Isotopes

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter] revealing the equilateral geometry behind quantum Chemistry.

Allotropic formation and geometries of elemental nuclei is explained.

The mass-Energy relationship behind isotope formation is revealed dispelling the historical notion of extra Neutrons as the basis for isotopic weights.

The fifty-fourth chapter in the third release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of EM mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
