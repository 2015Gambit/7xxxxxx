What's new in Flight Deck 5?

FSX - moving carrier - you'll takeoff and land from a moving surface
FSX - super-accurate launch and recovery using 3WireX technology
FSX - five great missions and 60+ mini training missions
FSX - maverick missle
Aircraft Carrier - fly from the new USS Gerald R Ford

Flight Deck 5 incorporates brand new technology featuring an aircraft carrier that moves and a super accurate catapult launch and recovery system*. You'll experience the thrill of authentic deck operations with AI traffic on and above the carrier. You'll see why cable recovery on the short flight deck is both thrilling and nerve-wracking.

DOES NOT WORK WITH DX10 turned on. This will make all airplanes just plain grey.
