Please filter it some more (lots of grain taking up space) and encode it in a 700MB x264."

,.Leto.,2012-08-17T00:15Z,"Who still cares about the size? We're in 2012 you know. I download 400-500GB every month, 3.4GB is nothing at all. Anyway, picture quality is decent for a cam, audio sound like it's coming from a can but dialogues are perfectly understandable nonetheless."
