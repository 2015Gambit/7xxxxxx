Here you are claiming that you release 1080p to 720p  releases!
Yet the resolution is 980x720 !!!

From what planet are you folks !!!

Don't you know 1080p is atleast 1920x1080 and 720p = 1280x720 !!?

Do i dare to ask what framerate it is  ??

... 90000 >_>"

As your name implies, you are really really dumb. No words can really describe how dumb you are.

Those missing pixels are cropped black bars.

You are so fucking stupid. "

,DumStick,2012-08-14T14:03Z,"@islam and iiaaa ,

Black or white , purple or pink borders is BESIDE THE POINT HERE !!!

First of, despite of any borders the picture Resolution is and alway's has been 1280x720 for 720p and 1920x1080p for 1080p capiche..?

Now, if i hear your correct you say the res of this release = 1280x720 - border = 980 x 720 right ?

Wrong... it is still 1280x720 if that is what you ARE IMPLYING here ?  Else if the picture frame is indeed 980x720 because of the removed borders then my feathered friend...

YOU JUST HAVE UPLOADED YET ANOTHER piece of crap that is not compliant with the current bluray specifications !!

DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR HERE ehhh !!

Pay attention especialy at the resolution this guy has used & indeed is infact the res (borders included i!!) according to media info

now are you 2 gonna tell me that 1328 x720 now day's is the new HD compliant standards ?

I rather take my chance with 1280x720 when i have to play it in stand alone for the obvious reasons...
