Love the game, already played for 7 hours since just installing it last night. Keep up the good work!

Had this for my crappy JB 3GS, now I have it on my unrooted P970 Optimus Black! Fantastic.

Thanks for releasing cracked games that don't need root access to work.

,Kooblukhan,2012-08-22T11:05Z,"uninstalled and deleted twice, then downloaded the bobiras22 files and installed and it worked perfectly.

not sure why since they appear to be the exact same in every respect but hey, if you are having trouble with this version trying to authenticate, you might want to download his.

again thanks for all your hard work .bone, enjoyed many of your uploads.  also dunno why anyone cares whether others re-up their stuff, whether u did or not.  I am always gonna prefer a skull anyways and no one is getting paid, we all do this to hook others up so why care?  no one can measure your dick on the internet.."
