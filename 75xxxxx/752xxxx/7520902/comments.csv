,BrianSeym,2012-08-11T09:48Z,"As a fan of Broken Lizard, I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10.  Screw the critics."
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-11T10:26Z,"I'll check it out cuz it's Broken Lizard,but I can't stand Olivia Munn.shes the reason the old Hollywood saying ""fake it til ya make"" has become ""Munn it til ya done it"".shes nothing but a set of tits looking for a pay check"
,stinki,2012-08-11T12:28Z,"Olivia Munn is talented and she's going to become a better actress. She is an easy target because she looks like a hot girl, but she was as funny, and often funnier, than Kevin on Attack of the Show. She was a fantastic host.  And she holds her own against actors with decades of experience on Newsroom (still, an awful show). 

Broken Lizard rule and they were obviously impressed too. Haters just gonna hate.."
,stinki,2012-08-11T12:34Z,"She tried too hard on The Daily Show, but there's a reason she was given a shot to join The Daily Show cast.....She's actually really intelligent..And shows loads of promise...She's not just another Hollywood starlet with nothing going on upstairs."
,Fritz.,2012-08-11T17:26Z,"Honestly its kind of sad that many women are still making it on a pretty face and a big chest when we all know they are just paying a plastic surgeon for it and 95% of women you see on tv or in movies are all barbie doll perfect.

i mean i like a pretty woman just as much as the next guy, but it is honestly kind of sad how easy it is for a woman to get ahead if she just spends some money for 'augmentations' "

,c_moore47102,2012-08-12T00:15Z,"Hey everyone, I figured since the user had a green skull that the file would be without problems, but I don't seem to have audio? Does anyone else have this problem? Though I didn't try the initial .avi file because I immediately converted it to .mp4 to play on my flatscreen and deleted the .avi without proper verification... But it's not even like the audio is cutting out or out of sync, there is NOTHING! I've never had this problem before when converting with Handbrake..."

,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-12T10:53Z,"@stinki it has nothing to do with her looks,it has to do with her lack of talent.I don't even care if her tits are fake or not cuz shes a fake person all around.as far as AOTS goes the table in front of Kevin is funnier than he is.but at least he knows what hes talking about,its not all just random words on a tele-prompter like it was to her.& if The News Room gets picked up again next season it will be because of the Oscar,Emmy & Golden Globe winners the cast is filled with,not the bitch that failed at her last 2 acting gigs"

,aradiel,2012-08-15T15:52Z,"Mine wouldn't play on my media players, but played fine on PC. Keep your codecs up to date if you're having trouble playing it. That said, for something labeled as XviD you'd think it would have more compatibility."

,Cinesis,2012-08-19T21:07Z,"This movie drags from the start. The actor cast for the main role is boring. The movie is directed by an Indian guy who put a goofy Indian ""gansta""-type character into the plot in a way he hoped would normalize Indians in America, and portray Indians as ""cool"" and even dominant over Caucasians. 

If you don't believe me, pay special attention to the very racist references to Chinese people. I was in India last year for a month, and Indians say nasty things about the Chinese - like they ""Eat their own babies."""
,end77,2012-08-23T22:24Z,"@Cineses Yes we know the china-india connection, india is jealous america is outsourcing work to china instead of india despite how much work is already being outsourced to india ... but as a director (and actor in he same movie) he made fun of indians too.

And what's with 'dominate over caucasians'? That's even more racist if you think we caucasians are special because of our color. The director even made fun of indians, he was supposed to be the mastermind but his plans were all wrong, and then your 'caucasians' corrected him, so don't embarrass yourself saying things like that.

I am european, and I think indians and chinese are both as nasty. The movie is funny regardless."
,end77,2012-08-23T22:54Z,"@Cinesis oh and it's ok when americans make a mock of every nationality in their movies, the mexican, south americans, chinese, indians, everyone except the jews, and you're mad because this movie is little bit racist? ... Stop making ridiculous demands."

,ral7de,2012-09-05T05:52Z,This si one sucky movie.
,ProphetZarquon,2012-09-12T07:37Z,"Plays fine in VLC, but definitely a flawed rip and NOT XviD standard.

V:8 (If it works for you)
A:8
M:...4

I liked Beerfest & Super Troopers was more entertaining than I expected.  This was less.

My thoughts on Olivia Munn:

Loved her on G4TV (Attack Of The Show & XPlay), UNTIL I heard that for all her talk she doesn't actually play games much if at all!  THAT'S fake - working for a video-game network and claiming to be a gamer when you're not...  She even reviewed games without actually having played them herself.

As an actress she's tolerable.  Better than just a pretty face, but certainly no Oscar-worthy performances yet (not surprising given the material).

As a model she's HOT.  And she was willing to go the extra mile to ham it up alongside Kevin Pereira on AOTS, something only Sarah Underwood seemed willing to do lately.

(From what I've seen, now that Kevin is gone AOTS is seeing much lower ratings, and the procession of unfunny awkward guest hosts is getting worse and worse.  Kevin was a sleazebag and not half as funny as he thought he was, but seeing these other guys trip over themselves trying to deliver the same cheap humor is wearing thin.)"
,misjah,2012-09-16T17:47Z,The sound clips every second for me. Like someone is playing with a mute button? Anyone else have this problem?
