Mary comes looking to India for a surrogate mother to bear a child. She finds a poor woman Yashoda who accepts the offer. Yashoda gets pregnant successfully. But during her pregnancy, doctors inform Mary & Yashoda that due to some complications the child would probably be born with disabilities. Mary decides to quit through this and leaves India. Yashoda begs her to not leave. But she is then left alone with a child in her womb. Few years later Mary looses her patience and decided to come back and look for her child. The film shows the story in legal and emotional perspective of who should the child be with; his surrogate mother who raised him or his mother who has the blood relation with him.
