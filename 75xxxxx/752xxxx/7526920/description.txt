Well this is my second torrent guys (not including the first failed Slipknot torrent).

This is the second album from the Scottish "Post-Hardcore" band Yashin, titled We Created A Monster, and it was released in 2012. I won't go into specifics, as a Wikipedia search will turn up all you need to know about them.

I got this d/l from another site, that i can't remember the address of, and can't be asked to look for again, and seeing as it wasn't on here, I've decided to upload it here. Aren't I nice?

Its perfect quality, at 320 bit-rate, if the other torrent description is to be believed anyways. I've listened to it myself a couple times over, and I can say that no matter what the bit-rate is, its flawless, and I personally love the album.

So, enjoy guys, and remember to seed and buy if you like/can afford to!

P.S: I have a YouTube channel, where I'm doing Minecraft videos, but if you wanna check me out, pop PhoenixPyres into Youtube's search engine :)

Enjoy!
