Comments:
Nice Jerry show, Lovely Forever young, Mississippi Moon that brings it on home.  You can just picture Jerry up on stage getting soulful... Sound Quality in my anal opinion is very good, enjoy this one.  Edhead

added new md5 file in main folder, old file was md5 file for .WAV 

Outstanding recording with one major and a few minor glitches -
d1t01 - static @ 07:05 - left as is.
d1t02 - static @ 00:42, 03:49 repaired.
d1t07 - static pop @01:46 repaired.
d2t01 - Lt channel static @ 00:04 repaired.
d2t04 - CUTS OFF at the end...
Clapping (in time) by either Gloria or Jaclyn can be heard throughout.
