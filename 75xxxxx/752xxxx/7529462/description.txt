With summer around the corner, hundreds of thousands of music lovers have started preparing 
themselves for the beginning of the festival season. The growing presence of dance music in 
the charts means that this year, DJs are filling more headline slots than ever before and 
appealing to a more commercial, mainstream audience. Festivals such as Creamfields, Global 
Gathering, SW4, Coachella, Ultra Music Fesitval and Tomorrowland are still going strong and 
are increasingly being seen as unmissable stops on the summer festival circuit.
