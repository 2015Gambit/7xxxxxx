Sarah returns for school after saving Ethan from his vampire bite. Though she has finally accepted that she is a vampire, she is very different. Meanwhile, there is a mysterious green mist that appears to be going around killing vampires, but unfortunately, Ethan is being blamed for the killings. The head of the vampire council (Addison Holley) threatens Sarah that either she has to take the punishment or Ethan does. Ethan, Benny, and Rory find a way to stop the green mist; they race to the vampire council and save the vampires from the mist, causing the council to let them go and lift Ethan's blame. Though the mist is gone, Ethan questions the identity of the person who conjured the mist, concluding that the person must have a strong hatred toward vampires.
