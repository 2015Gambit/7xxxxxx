Guilty By Appearance is a rapgroup from the dark forests of Sweden, born and raised in a country of heathens, far away from the garden of Eden.
Inspired by punk, we deliver anarchist hiphop that criticize the patriarchal system and the illusion of democracy, and bringeth forward a wish for a free, open society and a sustainable, ecological, fair world.
Shaped by our engagement in animal and human liberation-groups and the Occupy Movement we call out to the people to wake up.
