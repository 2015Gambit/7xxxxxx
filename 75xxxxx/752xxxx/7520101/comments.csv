Only issue with this one is no matter what serial number I try it comes up as invalid. Am I doing something wrong? Never had any issues with your other torrents."
,polarbear12,2012-08-11T06:03Z,"Same here, no v2 sn works."
,polarbear12,2012-08-11T06:25Z,"Actually I think the problem is that if, like myself, you had a previous 1.x version installed then you need to 'Upgrade' using an Upgrade SN AND your old 1.x SN as well."
,IRON-J,2012-08-12T06:48Z,Thanks polarbear12. No joy unfortunately.
,Muffin_Top,2012-08-25T10:24Z,"followed ur directions, still didnt work"
,Muffin_Top,2012-08-25T10:47Z,"OH WAIT! i found a link to Screenium 2.1.1 that works perfectly with serial included. and best part is u dont need to upgrade anything and it doesnt matter if u have the previous version still installed. Here is the link: http://lumfile.com/bofa9sc03kgg/Sc211.zip.html

Just click 'Free User download slow speed (it really isnt that slow) then just type in the security code (or whatever u wanna call it) then just wait til the download file button appears, click it and i think u can figure it out from there. if u have any questions, just make a reply to this comment.

#note there may be an advertisement that pops up, in the top right corner, click where it says 'Close' or u can press esc."
