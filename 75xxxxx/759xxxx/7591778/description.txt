HereΓÇÖs a rare treat for those who love Polyrock. This is an ultra rare CD, out of print and impossible to come by. For those who have no clue who Polyrock is: Polyrock was a post-punk-new wave band formed in New York City in 1978. The group was produced by the composer Philip Glass and Kurt Munkacsi. The band, led by singer/guitarist Billy Robertson (formerly of the group Model Citizen), had a keyboard-heavy sound. Polyrock's lineup also included vocalist Catherine Oblasney, guitarist Tommy Robertson, drummer Joseph Yannece, keyboard player Lenny Aaron, and Curt Cosentino. It remains to-date one of the most underrated and criminally forgotten new wave bands of the 80s. Their music and sound is so brilliant and unique.
