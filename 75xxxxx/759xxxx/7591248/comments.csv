,AdiAdrian,2012-09-06T13:31Z,how to create file ico_update.png? 
,AdiAdrian,2012-09-06T13:41Z,"ok ok i answer myself

Any photo editor will create a Portable Network Graphic (.png) file. The new version of Microsoft Paint on Vista even saves in a .png if you choose.

So use either GIMP, Photoshop, Paint, Fireworks, etc. and save it in a .png format.

Thx dude, it really works"

,Adernhael,2012-09-10T00:11Z,Looks like they found and deactivated all the free keys so it doesn't work anymore.
,desss,2012-09-10T10:39Z,@Adernhael look my older post.
,ricklafer,2012-09-11T02:48Z,"worked .... after installation just deleted the file  ico_update.png  C:Usersyour usernameAppDataLocalMirillis  or have the windows search that file. After I created another file ico_update.png in paint,  then in the properties file attributes read only. 
Now just open the Splah pro and put the password.
do not forget to shut off the internet before this whole procedure
WORKED PERFECTLY !!!"
