You may feel the need for speed, but do you really understand it properly? James May does. In this fast-moving mix of animation and motion graphics he tries to figure out how you can catch speeding bullets in your teeth, why the Moon doesn't fall out of the sky, why his cat knows more about terminal velocity than he does and why a six-ton chicken cannot run.

So, if you want to know what's the fastest way around the world, how you can dodge a hurricane and whether you should run home in the rain, let James bring you up to speed.
