,Rokovak,2012-09-05T04:04Z,Why is this being called episode 9 of season 8? This is episode 1 of season 9.
,XiaoXiong,2012-09-05T07:59Z,"Because it was filmed during the 8th season. Once Bourdain announced he was leaving for another network, they held the remaining episodes of season 8 to broadcast during an abbreviated 9th season. That's why season 8 only had eight episodes, and 9 will only have six."
