"Basics of Oncology" provides an easily understood and general overview of the basic medical, scientific and clinical aspects of cancer. Causes, pathology, clinical features, diagnostic investigations, treatments and outcomes are all carefully explained and discussed, both for cancers in general and for the common cancers in individual countries. The reader will thereby be provided with an understanding of how and why people develop cancer, how the body reacts to cancer, what can be done to prevent the disease, and how the various cancers are best diagnosed and treated. The book will serve as a sound basis for the more detailed or specific studies that may be needed in different areas of practice and in different countries. It will be invaluable for students of medicine, nurse oncologists, students of medical sciences and other health professionals in all parts of the world.
