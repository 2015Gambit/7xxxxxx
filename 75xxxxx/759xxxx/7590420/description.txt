DESCRIPTION:
Download web files much faster by using wifi and mobile data at the same time!
Share or open a link from any program, like the web browser, and download it at speeds up to two times faster than usual.
This is the only downloader tool that can download using wifi and mobile data connection simultaneously!
IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Since this program uses mobile data connection, by using it you may incur in additional charges from your network operator.
- To unleash its full potential, this program needs good (and balanced) wifi and mobile reception/bandwidth.
- Using both connections is not supported on all devices / rom combinations.
- Some web servers may provide insufficient functionalities on the requested files.
- The Lite version has a filesize limit of 50 megabytes.
USAGE:
Just click on a link or open a remote file: if the file type is recognised by Super Download, it will start getting it.
If this method doesn't work, try click-and-hold on the link, select "share with" and choose SuperDownload.
Finally, you can copy and paste a url in the "add url" dialog.
PLANNED FEATURES:
- Multiple files
- Pause
- Resume broken downloads
- Other ways of speeding up downloads
- Visual tweaks
