A truly postmodernist movie.Quite rare if we take in account the history of the place (Romanian cinematography !), but really a must.Bold ideas, humour all the way, history and literature intelligent quotes,charming characters and great (most of them) actors, situations the offer you the possibility to choose between a serious approach (e.g.the secret weapon - see what is the real secret and how it offers the possibility to improve, helas, to late, this "deep thinking piece of work") and an easier but still, full of satisfaction one ( the spoon fight or the gifted fairy who's so keen to sing her pathetic little song).Be ready for a good laugh and, if you have the time and will, for a good subject of deep thinking.Don't take it too serious though!
