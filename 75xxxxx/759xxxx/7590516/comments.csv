,Coltbear50,2012-09-07T22:59Z,"I'll never understand why people are not grateful for what IS uploaded (especially in excellent 320 kbps) format, rather than ask the uploader for a different format.

Let me say thank you to the DRT for all the superb quality uploads you have so graciously shared with everyone!"

If the uploader have the time and the CD to upload, I believe he will be glad to do so."
