The most brilliant young economist in AmericaΓÇöthe one so deemed, at 
least, by a jury of his eldersΓÇöbrakes to a stop at a traffic light on ChicagoΓÇÖs south side. It is a sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy Cavalier with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesnΓÇÖt quite shut,  producing a dull roar at highway speeds.
 
But the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets: gas stations,  boundless concrete, brick buildings with plywood windows. 
An elderly homeless man approaches. It says he is homeless right on his 
sign, which also asks for money. He wears a torn jacket, too heavy for the  warm day, and a grimy red baseball cap. 

The economist doesnΓÇÖt lock his doors or inch the car forward. Nor does 
he go scrounging for spare change. He just watches, as if through one-way  glass. After a while, the homeless man moves along. 
ΓÇ£He had nice headphones,ΓÇ¥ says the economist, still watching in the 
rearview mirror. ΓÇ£Well, nicer than the ones I have. Otherwise, it doesnΓÇÖt look like he has many assets.ΓÇ¥
