Ripped from my own TS3 Future perfect DVD, and as I did not see any other versions on here OR usenet I decided to host my first torrent ever

in here is an .ISO and a .MDF, created with DVDRipper,

I have tested this game myself, burned it to DVD and then put it in the PS2, it ran flawlessy, also tested with an emulator (PCSX2) and had no problems at all (atleast as far the general problems go)

Game is multi language, you get to choose english,french,italian and 2 other languages at start, 50Hz and 60Hz is supported and widescreen too..


I'll be seeding this for a while so enjoy people (mind that my seeding computer is not on 24/7 but it will turn on every day....

My upload is around 800KB/S so more people helping seed this will certainly help me
