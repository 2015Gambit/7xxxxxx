"River Rock Inn"

Award-winning chef and hospitality expert 
Gordon Ramsay checks into the River Rock 
Inn in Milford, PA. The hotel, established 
in the 1880s, is falling apart. It's in 
desperate need of a cleaning, there are 
dead bugs everywhere and Ramsay discovers 
a disgusting galaxy of stains on one 
particular bed spread that sends him 
through the roof.

Enjoy :)
