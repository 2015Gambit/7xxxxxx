Features of this Jimbus edition highly compressed:
--------
 
 - The game is only in English and updated to 1.04 version.
 - Every mission can be unlocked.
 - It includes a tutorial, a trainer and the libraries the game requires.
 - The game can only be played online, using Steam and GreenLuma.
 - The cooperative and the multiplayer modes also work.


Notice this is the full game. Do not install it over an existing installation.


Do not say it does not work (because it does). Read carefully the info included in the installer and the .pdf file and, if necessary, update GreenLuma to the newest version.
