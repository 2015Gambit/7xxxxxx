     "Puppet on a String" is the name of the Eurovision Song Contest-winning song in 1967 by British singer Sandie Shaw. It was her thirteenth UK single release. The song was a UK Singles Chart number one hit on 27 April 1967, staying at the top for a total of three weeks.
    "Those Were the Days" is a song credited to Gene Raskin, who put English lyrics to the Russian song "Dorogoi dlinnoyu" ("By the long road"), written by Boris Fomin (1900ΓÇô1948) with words by the poet Konstantin Podrevskii. It deals with reminiscence upon youth and romantic idealism.The song is best remembered, however, in English-speaking countries, for Mary Hopkin's 1968 recording. Hopkin's recording was produced by Paul McCartney and became a #1 hit in the UK singles chart. In the US, Hopkin's recording reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Billboard Easy Listening charts for six weeks. In the Netherlands it topped the charts for 2 consecutive weeks. Paul McCartney also recorded Hopkin singing "Those Were The Days" in four other languages for release in their respective countries: In Spain, Que Tiempo Tan Feliz, In West Germany, An jenem Tag, In Italy, Quelli Erano Giorni and In France, Le temps des fleurs.
