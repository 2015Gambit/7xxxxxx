If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.



Requirements: Android 2.1+
Overview: This is an engineering calculator, with equation solvers, interpolations, wolfram alpha, converter, complex numbers... and more in the future!


This is an engineering calculator, with equation solvers, interpolations, wolfram alpha, converter, complex numbers... and more in the future!

This is an application designed for engineers but can be used by anyone. Once you open the app you'll see a simple calculator with a swipe keyboard but there's much more behind.

This is a powerful application which has the following features:

- Equation Solver: You can solve almost any equation. It supports:
-> Non-linear equations: Any type of equation, such as: 5*x+sin(x^3+2)=8 (up to 10 equations and variables, you can see 2 equations solved in the screenshots)
-> Linear equations: Like 2*x+3*y=8, -3*x+6*y=3 (up to 10)
-> Polynomials: Up to grade 20 (complex and non-complex solutions)

- Interpolation
-> Simple: Perfect for thermodynamic tables with only one variable (for example Temperature)
-> Double: 2 variables interpolation. See screenshots for a preview
-> Points to line: If you have a set of points (x,y) this tool will find the closest line and will give you the R^2 (Just like Excel).

- Converter: It's useful to have a converter inside the app. It's got 19 conversions: length, area, volume, angle, time, speed, acceleration, flow, mass, force, torque, energy, density, pressure, dynamic viscosity, kinematic viscosity, temperature and currency.

- Wolfram Alpha search: Just touch the search button

- Complex numbers: The calculator supports complex numbers in both rectangular and polar notation. Polar notation us useful for phasors in Circuit Analysis.

- Variables: Just save any number as a variable and use it later.

- Constants: 6, more in next updates.

- Radians/degrees

- Easier decimal notation: 1.000000 is 1, 99999999 is 9.999E7 (depending of the decimal precision)...

- And probably more features in the future!
