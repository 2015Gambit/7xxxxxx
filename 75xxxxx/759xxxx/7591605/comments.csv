In the middle of playing, the ""Disc is Unreadable"" error would come up. I burned a second copy and the same thing happened. Verbatims on a flashed iHas on a 3.0 Xbox. So I thought no biggie when the Game of the Year Edition was released. But guess what? Same thing! 

Anyone having similar issues?
