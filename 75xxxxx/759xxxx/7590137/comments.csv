not much loss, an obvious direct cinema cam..too much white saturation and sound distortion

but, better than nothing..lol"

,kentcave,2012-09-05T02:38Z,"as I said..thank you nonetheless

Flow of story and action coherent if followed carefully from the start till end.
Those negative reviews at imdb just didnt give the time and justice deserved."
