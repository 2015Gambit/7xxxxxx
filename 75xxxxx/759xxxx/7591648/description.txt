Last Hope is a single-player side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game for the Neo Geo AES, Neo Geo CD, and Dreamcast systems. It was developed by German indie developer NG:DEV.TEAM in 2006.[1] While the Neo Geo version was self-published, the Dreamcast version was released by redspotgames in January 2007, as an unlicensed title.[2] In 2009 The Dreamcast version received a reprint in the form of a Directors Cut called Last Hope Pink Bullets. This edition features improved on screen visibility in comparison to its 1st print due to pink bullets etc. That and various other features make the game easier to allow a more accessible gameplay experience with emphasis on scoring.[3]

As a response to criticism regarding the game's difficulty, the developer released an updated version titled Last Hope: Pink Bullets for the Dreamcast on September 19, 2009. This edition features improved on screen visibility in comparison to its 1st print due to pink bullets etc. That and various other features make the game easier to allow a more accessible gameplay experience with emphasis on scoring.[5]

Some of the changes are:

This game is still pretty damn hard but still a well-made r-type ummmmm type of game. So glad the Dreamcast is still kicking after all these years.

I use Alcohol 120 to burn CDI files and it works perfectly.
