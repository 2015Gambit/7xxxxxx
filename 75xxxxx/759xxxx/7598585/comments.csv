1. Download NoCD mod here

2. Download the framework file in second point in the website below 
http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files
3. Extract the framework file in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sim 3
4. Extract the NoCD mod and a file should appear
5. Place the file in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Mods/Packages

And your all done. Nothing else to click or do. 
Start your game by clicking
*Where you downloaded your game to*...Electronic Arts/The Sims 3 *(BASE GAME)*/Game/Bin/TS3.exe
The CD authentication should not pop up anymore.
Do not start via the launcher. I tried that it did not work.

Stuff to note:
Should there be a new patch, constantly check that your mod is usable for the new patch level over here
http://nraas.wikispaces.com/NoCD

Nraas also has lots of other mods which you can download using the same method. Check their website!

This works 100% even without the crack but only with some tweaking. It's not even hard. Do this: 

1st Install the game then follow this instructions:

You can get this to work now,
you just have to jump through a few hoops to get there.
Once you’ve installed the game, copy the “Caches”, “Game”, “GameData” and “Thumbnails” folders to the “The Sims 3 Supernatural” folder.
Then go to “The Sims 3 Supernatural” > “Game” > “Bin” and change “Sims3Launcher.ex_” to “Sims3Launcher.exe” and “TS3EP07.ex_” to “TS3EP07.exe”
you have to go into “Default.ini” and “skuversion.txt” and change the line “GameVersion = 15.0.135.018017″ to “GameVersion = 15.0.135.018001″.
After this you can use the nocd mod and play the game (Remember to install frameworks)
Have fun !
More info on how to install the nocd and frameworks:
1. Download NoCD mod here
http://nraas.wikispaces.com/NoCD+Phase+One
2. Download the framework file in second point in the website below
http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files

I did this and it worked! Couldn't even believe it. But so happy I'm going to play all day and night now. Hope you guys use this info! Remember to install the Framework so that you can use the Nocd mod. Follow the instructions on the links carefully. Then do the small changes to the files and copy the folders mentioned over to supernatural folder. 
this step: ""you have to go into “Default.ini” and “skuversion.txt” and change the line “GameVersion = 15.0.135.018017″ to “GameVersion = 15.0.135.018001″"" might give small trouble, drag them to your desktop which allows them to be modified, then put them back. 
Tada!

,CoolasAtorrent,2012-09-05T18:41Z,u can not update your game with crack in it or it will mess up your game. you have to take it out and replace it with original files...Instead Use poweriso mount iso with virtual drive set to automount so when u start up its mounts no need to ever use a crack and it will not mess anything up...

PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FROM 
@zaronon at 2012-09-04 16:39 CET:

You can get this to work now, you just have to jump through a few hoops to get there.
Once you've installed the game, copy the ""Caches"", ""Game"", ""GameData"" and ""Thumbnails"" folders to the ""The Sims 3 Supernatural"" folder.
Then go to ""The Sims 3 Supernatural"" > ""Game"" > ""Bin"" and change ""Sims3Launcher.ex_"" to ""Sims3Launcher.exe"" and ""TS3EP07.ex_"" to ""TS3EP07.exe""
After this you can use the nocd mod and play the game

@zaronon at 2012-09-04 16:46 CET:
ah forgot the last bit.
you have to go into ""Default.ini"" and ""skuversion.txt"" and change the line ""GameVersion = 15.0.135.018017"" to ""GameVersion = 15.0.135.018001"".

sorry 'bout that.

The uploader is a retard. The installer doesn't ""install"" anything and you have to copy over the folders yourself. Also, you have to get the serial numbers from the first page of these comments pages:

BJMM-BT8M-53RN-WKFJ-K2JT
ZHZ9-5RSL-Y8P6-YEC7-3HKW
P89H-8B8R-KC5V-5X5V-8X7R
