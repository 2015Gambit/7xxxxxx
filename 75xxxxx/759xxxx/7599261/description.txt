If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.


Alcohol 120% is the CD & DVD emulation and recording program that will allow users to easily copy a visible and an invisible disc.

Alcohol 120% enables users to create 31 virtual CD & DVD-ROM to play discs without needing a physical disc, it also enables users to copy CD & DVD to CD-R / CD-RW / DVD-R / DVD-RW / DVD-RAM / DVD+RW. Alcohol 120% combines all functions of Alcohol 52% (CD & DVD emulation software).

Alcohol brings a new meaning to the word multimedia! It is without a doubt a leader in its class, bringing the ability to emulate and record CDs and DVDs together into one amazingly easy to use software program.

Using the latest technology the program is constantly being developed and improved to add new features, allowing it to maintain it's position as a leading software package.

Imagine being able to store your most used CDs as images on your computer and just call them up at the click of a button! And then run them at 200x the speed of some CD drives and without requiring the CD itself! How about being able to make a backup of that CD onto another CD either using the CD itself or just using the image you have created? This is what Alcohol allows you to do and much more.
