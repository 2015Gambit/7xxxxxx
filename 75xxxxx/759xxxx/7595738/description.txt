Overview:
In Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara's experiences changed her deeply. SheΓÇÖs become a darker, hardened, imperious version of herself. A desperate phone call from her former mentor Von Croy leads her to Paris. But as she arrives, she discovers that the old man was brutally murdered and a plot to frame her for his death is in motion. Avoiding the people pursuing her, she needs to clear her name and unravel the mystery of an ominous medieval order of alchemists and mystics. Surprisingly, she doesnΓÇÖt have to take on the world by herself this time. LaraΓÇÖs kindred spirit, an adventurer by the name of Kurtis Trent, is there to offer a helping hand. But can he be trusted? 

With a new graphics engine, new moves, new playable character, and a new approach to storytelling, this Tomb Raider game feels more like a Dan Brown novel than an Indiana Jones movie. Be sure not to miss this new chapter in Lara CroftΓÇÖs saga.
