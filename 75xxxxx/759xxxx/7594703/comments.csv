,kmmk13,2012-09-05T02:38Z,@crilla999 What should I do ? pay or ignore it ?
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-05T05:10Z,Ignore it and erase all trace of the program. Don't pay.
,crilla999,2012-09-05T09:04Z,@kmmk13: ACE Translator has stolen my identity by hacking my email client and sent the information to the company. I think it is a crime equivalent to copyright infringement so I'm not going to pay. Have read through what others have done to victims of crime and they have regretted that they paid. Delete the program and ignore all future email threats. Never respond to their emails.
