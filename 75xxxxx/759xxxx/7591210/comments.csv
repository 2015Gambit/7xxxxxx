,rone_181,2012-09-02T04:12Z,"why is ur torrent taking so long to download?

i downloaded all ur torrents last season never had a problem. most downloaded in 15 minutes or less. last week took me almost an hour to get it downloaded and this week it's has been 1.25 hours and it's only 33% completed"
,lucabara,2012-09-02T04:13Z,and yes i am seeding your torrents at least 3 times the size of the download

,SheffGraph,2012-09-02T10:06Z,Are there no fans of lower league teams on PB? Match of The Day appears instantly each episode but we have one Football League Show from 2 weeks ago! Can anyone point me in the direction of the 01 09 12 show? Many thanks
[T],footy,2012-09-02T15:20Z,"@SheffGraph : The show is aired very late at night, so it will only be uploaded the next day. This week's show is here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7592666/The_Football_League_Show_01.09.2012"
,hoaxse7en,2012-09-03T00:08Z,Would it be possible to get it in higher quality? Even if it's double the size I think most would appreciate it?
,John777Berry,2012-09-03T03:08Z,"Footy! You're doing great work, man --- but the sun has risen in the east on Monday morning & we're gagging for MOTD 2.... THANKS in anticipation...!!!"
