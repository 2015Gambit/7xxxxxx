 Introducing Qubes 1.0!
After nearly three years of work, I have a pleasure to announce that Qubes 1.0 has finally been released! To see the installation instructions and to get an ISO, please go to this page.

I would like to thank all the developers who have worked on this project. Creating Qubes OS has been a great challenge, especially for such a small team as ours, but ultimately, I'm very glad with the final outcome ΓÇô it really is a stable and reasonably secure desktop OS. In fact I cannot think of any more secure alternative...

I use the term ΓÇ£reasonably secureΓÇ¥, because when it comes to defensive security it's difficult to use definite statements (ΓÇ£secureΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£unbreakableΓÇ¥, etc), unless one can formally prove the whole design and implementation to be 100% secure.
