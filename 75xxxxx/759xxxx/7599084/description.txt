Episode 14: Slutty Island
Tomas arrives at the 'Wives party, while Aviva also makes her way to St. Barths.
The ladies have invited friends over to the villa for a party, but only two people show up -- Cat, LuAnn's old friend, and Tomas, the "Johnny Deep look-alike" from the night before. The ladies think it was Tomas that LuAnn brought back to the villa the previous night and Ramona takes the opportunity to get to the bottom of it. The next day the ladies head out for a calming and fun day on a yacht. Meanwhile Aviva and Reid are en route to St. Barths, despite Aviva's fear of flying in small planes, but when they arrive, Aviva doesn't receive the warm welcome from them that she was anticipating.
