Thanks you so much my friend.This app isnt cracked yet(i think its too expesive as android app to have a chance to cracked in the future).

But you can try this:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&feature=related_apps

and let me know if this help(it is for blind people too)"

greatful, for the fast reply,
yes indeed, its an xpns app, but we hoped that some of the dev's could freeze the trial v sence its 30 days comp functional.
like in the time stopper in windows.
but what about the acapela tts its free to download in the us & a few other countrys and we cannot download the voices without it.
and about the other apps aimd to the blinds they kinda work but not as MA & the difrince is huge...
and as you know there  is hope always look at jaws for windows its the most xpnsv and cracked 24 hours after the last releace...
my best reguards..."

Yes acapella tts its free but its in beta stage.You cant download it from the market?The country you are in the acapella tts is banned?

Also if you have root in your phone try with lucky patcher to patch the MA

And my last chance for make it work.Use the SD Maid Pro.With this apllication you can freeze an android app/game at its current state.So maybe there is a chance the app will never expire.

I hope lucky patcher or sd maid pro to work with the MA.Because and the blind people have the rights to live as close as we do.And i wish i could help more."

I don't get how you patch it though. I followed the instructions in the folder but when I go patch it, the patch name says it's for 5.1.6. Do I just patch as usual or am I doing something wrong?"
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-03T13:02Z,"@CreamyDreams

Yes mate the patch it same and work with this version too.Just follow exactly my instructions and you will be fine."
