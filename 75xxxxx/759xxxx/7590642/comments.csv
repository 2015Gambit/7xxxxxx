,music60,2012-09-01T23:19Z,"Not you again cyber dog! 
Go to work instead of seeding confusion.
You RIAA agent?"
,cybergodsig,2012-09-02T01:18Z,I had a bunch of problems early on.  Everthing is going now.
[T],jmz619,2012-09-02T03:19Z,You should upload these separate because like myself i'm not going to download each file.. Just saying..
,cybergodsig,2012-09-02T03:50Z,"Thats ok, pick what you want I'll keep it up."
,Bjellesau,2012-09-02T12:00Z,"Thanks for all sharing.
Ok, some seeds take long time, but who's in hurry without beeing demanding."

,cybergodsig,2012-09-03T07:23Z,Good luck getting this one a ha ha ha.  Just like me getting a copy of Queensryche DCC 24k Gold CD ain't gonna happen.  It was fun while it lasted.  If it wasn't for those meddlin' kids.
,jkp159,2012-09-03T10:02Z,"Cyberdogsig ----   Do you think you have won this moment?   By all initial appearances, you were an over-enthusiatic novice doing your best.   You refused to learn how to torrent, and you made promises to seed and learn, and then you quit again.    

Now I see you trashing other legitimate uploads in some sort of misguided revenge scheme.   

Stop.   Shut Up.   Stop being a leach and a lying drunken ass.   Stop wasting peoples' time and bandwidth.     

Go away.   You ruined the last days of lossless on Demonoid, and now you leave your dropping in the bay.   

Was this an elaborate troll?   Did you ""Win""?   Are you happy?      

idiot"

""I'm done with too much bullshit to deal with.""

Oh and here is another little jewel, made on 2012-09-01 in reaction to someone else's uppload.

""Do us all a favor and stop churning out this gaaaabidge.""

Can you believe the balls on this guy? Incredible. And about that CD, I've had that one (and most of the other one's) since the day it came out. Which is waaaay before you were even born. And I bought it. Didn't copy it from someone else taking credit for it.
