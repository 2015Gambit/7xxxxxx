On Trial is a groundbreaking, five part documentary series featuring unprecedented access to major criminal trials in Australian courts. For the first time cameras have been granted full access to the Supreme Court of Western Australian and the District Court of NSW where criminal cases are dealt with before judge and jury. The series features a murder trial, a major assault, and a robbery and assault trial. On Trial takes viewers behind the scenes as they observe the emotional and legal journeys of the accused. Each case provides key insights into often controversial legal processes, our adversarial legal system, and the day to day operation of our courts. On Trial charts the stories of both prosecution and defence as they undertake pre trial preparations in the tense build up before going to court. The series covers the jury selection process, opening addresses, examination of witnesses, cross examination and the summing up to juries and, if found guilty, sentencing. As well as charting the legal journey, the series traces the intimate emotional stories of the characters through observational coverage outside the court.
