,dukeford57,2012-09-05T23:07Z,"Thanks. But 'The Scene' has gone to either Mp4 or mkv which are better quality and smaller files. Personally I prefer the Mp4, so I'll wait. It is good to know that AVI is still a choice though."
,cindy25,2012-09-06T00:02Z,"I prefer avi, and from comments when the switch happens, most people do. as avi works on stand alone dvd players.
I only have to convert MP4 to avi


"
,dukeford57,2012-09-06T07:38Z,"cindy25, I used to feel the same way. but, the so-called scene changed the rules. the way I understand it is, if a download is created using the wrong set of rules or does not conform to the 'scene's' parameters it is nuked. and most of the new stand alone dvd players can play the mp4 format. even so with the higher quality smaller format mp4 I can put more episodes on a single dvd. I watch most programs on a PC monitor anyway. It's just a matter of preference. That being said, this has the following quality A=10, V=10. "
,mwalsher,2012-09-06T22:49Z,"@dukeford57, I donât think that most stand-alone players support MP4 or MKV; certainly not PS3 or Xbox 360. Sure, there may be some new and/or expensive ones that do, but for most people (like my mother), they are limited to XviD.

The main reason for the switch is because of the iPad. Unfortunately they don't realize that not everyone can afford an iPad."
