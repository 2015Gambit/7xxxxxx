                       - Barack Obama, election eve, 2008


Barack Obama is an enigma. He won the 2008 presidential election claiming to be a moderate and  wanting to bring Americans together and govern  from the center. But since he took of∩¼üce, his actions 
have been far from moderate. He has apologized to  foreign dictators abroad for sins he alleges his own  country committed and appointed a self-described  communist (Van Jones) and an admirer of Mao  Zedong to top White House posts. He has used the  economic crisis to take over whole industries and has economic crisis to take over whole industries and has attempted to nationalize the health care system. In his 
∩¼ürst nine months in of∩¼üce, these actions had already  made his presidency one of the most polarizing in  history.
