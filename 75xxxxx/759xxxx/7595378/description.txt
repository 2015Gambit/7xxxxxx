ΓÇó Speaker toggle while in call (just press your phone's MENU button)
ΓÇó Bluetooth audio toggle while in call (just press your phone's MENU button), uses *my* code for BT Audio, so you can try it for mono headsets or headsets that don't work with Skype's original BT support
ΓÇó Camera LED/flash support while in video-call (just press your phone's MENU button)
ΓÇó Advanced Settings:
ΓåÆ Sign-in status picker, allows you to pick your desired status (availability), which will be applied automatically just after logging-in.
ΓåÆ Keep screen alive, disables proximity sensor for calls
ΓåÆ Force-enable video-calling, for phones that can't get video-calling enabled.
*Video-calling needs compatible CPU (ARMv7). If your phone's CPU is not compatible, Skype will keep crashing/looping at login!*
ΓåÆ Force enable camera rotation, will attempt to enable camera rotate option (under the camera selection popup)
ΓåÆ Avoid setFPS, for some users that get black image in video-calls
ΓåÆ Use valid preview surface, for some users that get black image in video-calls (a bit buggy at the moment, but better than nothing )
ΓåÆ Prefer full-screen incoming video, won't allow your back camera image to take the whole screen leaving the incoming image minimized
ΓåÆ Force notification LED/BLN, for users that "Pulse notification light" option (in Skype original settings) doesn't actually enable notification LEDs or BLN!
ΓåÆ Advanced camera settings (resolution/focus/scene/white balance/color effect)
ΓåÆ Ringtone picker!
