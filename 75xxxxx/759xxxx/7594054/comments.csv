1 for an excellent 1 big avi file, no 2 little ones bs. 
and
1 for 5.1 audio!

thanx alot! 

now we just need the blue ray ver for some sweet HD action!
--------------------
and to others not liking mp4,mkv, x264, etc.  WHY?
(vlc/mpc all plays them all just fine)
they are needed if u want anything in HD. 
which is beautiful! 
i normally wont even bother getting a movie if its not HD. (at least a BRRip)
