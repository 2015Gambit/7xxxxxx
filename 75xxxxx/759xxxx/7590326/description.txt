Note: I used the Any DVD COnverter Professional software to rip this DVD. Tried every video file possible to keep original quality. But they all failed. This DVD is very protected. It would make the DVDFab software crash everytime. But I finally got one to work which was the DVD video NTSC movie (.mpg)format. SO download, enjoy, & especially SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
