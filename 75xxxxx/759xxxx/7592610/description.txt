NUT2 Edition: Dual Display works now

Listen, I am not a programmer, I don't have a knack for programming, but I can script a bit.  I run Avira on much of my PC's because it's free and lightweight IMO.

I don't want to buy it, and I hate the popups!!!!!!

So I wrote a program that 1) sets a policy to forbid programs from running
avnotify.exe (creates the huge fucking popup ads), and ipmgui.exe creates the junk-ass tray notification crap.


READ THE NFO

It'll allow you to set the policy

Then run the script I wrote in plain ol autohotkey that kills the policy window.

Works on Win7 X64, prob Win7 X32 and Vistas, like 0.005CPU and 1.5MB RAM




Scan it, check your network traffic blah blah, I dont have a skull and few uploads so some maybe skeptical that this EXE does rogue bullshit, it don't, and I don't blame you, TPB has been known to unknowingly traffic viruses and shit.  That's not the case here.  NUT2 will kill the window now no matter where it appears on a screen or dual-display and shit.

If you have questions, post a comment here and I'll try to help.
If you like it, cool, I like it.  If you want to just slam by meager attempt then fuck you write your own.
