,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T22:58Z,This is what I'm talking about! An avi encoded in xvid/divx! Perfect size! This is the standard for pirating new Doctor Who episodes. Great job! Thank you! :D
,jesusman82,2012-09-02T00:24Z,why does it say 2005? this isnt really that old crap is it? you can get the entire season why would this be up
,judge732,2012-09-02T00:50Z,"jeusman, 2005 was when the new series started, the episode is new"
,iarepants,2012-09-02T01:12Z,"Seeds would be nice, stuck at 10%.   "
,DrTeeth707,2012-09-02T01:53Z,"Unfortunately, many seeders keep putting the year '2005' in the titles. Not only is this wrong and misleading, it is also a PITA to have to rename. Thanks for the torrents, but get with the program guys."
,Eter_Puralis,2012-09-02T02:35Z,How is that misleading? Saves you from mixing it up with the old series -_- It's not wrong.
,bbsux,2012-09-02T05:14Z,"Umm, yes it is.  The episode was shown in 2012.  Put that in it.  Put them in different folders.

They are really technically separate shows, if you haven't figured that out by now you aren't a Dr Who fan.

And for heavens sake I wish we could all agree on a format for episodes.

I always have to reformat mine to seriesname 00x00 epsisodetitle.extension

ie:
Doctor Who 07x01 Asylum of the Daleks"
,1Manic,2012-09-02T07:18Z,the naming for this torrent is correct. the old series was 1963...this new series started in 2005..this is season 7 as stated..work it out...
,clawedthecat,2012-09-02T07:29Z,"Yeah the whole x264 in mp4 format is all fine well and good, just output in .avi format which is way better.

As for file format - S07E01 + file name

BTW thanks for the upload "
[V],psspss,2012-09-02T07:40Z,"the encoding of this avi wont show THUMBNAIL
under win 7
so something is different in the header 
so I fixed mine by recreating the avi xvid

and yes the name is correct... its season 7 of the new dr who.. else it would be called something like
Dr who Season 22 if was joined to the older version of dr who

alas since its new and didnt follow from the old dr who seasons it shouldnt be joined"
,NileQT87,2012-09-02T11:10Z,"Actually, it's season 33/series 7. ;) The latter just doesn't scare/confuse the newbies or marketing people so much (speaking of marketing, remember the nonsense where they were trying to call season 31/series 5 ""series 1""?--LOL).

Oh, thank you so much for .avi/xvid. The earlier xvid made of this has graffiti (ego, much?) and actually chops off a huge chunk of the sides through half of the episode for no reason and then brings it back.

It's missing the next episode preview segment with a blunt cut-off (I imagine that would have brought it up to the typical 350mb file size), which is a bit weird. But it's by far the best standard xvid that has appeared so far.

Thrilled that the BBC didn't do its own logo graffiti this year."
,LG_,2012-09-07T11:33Z,Thanks for avi - my player doesn't do all the other formats  :(
