The video quality is perfect, and so is the audio.
I've included screenshots:

,Growupkid,2012-09-04T18:37Z,This is lagging for me. How can I make it work right? Please help
,detlevwithav,2012-09-07T05:16Z,Great quality but lags for me as well. Could it be my codecs? I have xvid package and have never had any trouble with any other vids. I am using VLC which is the best imo.. any suggestions?

Thank you :)"
,mikeywiz,2012-09-08T23:28Z,"I'm still downloading ...but at 2.62 gb  ...and with comments saying A/V is 10/10 .....My guess would be that the file is higher (nice/clear)quality and therefore requires more resources to play without lagging.

If your machine is having trouble playing it ...try turning off your virus protection and any other programs you have running .... while ur playing this movie .

PS ... if that doesn't help ...it may be time to think about getting a faster computer ;)"
