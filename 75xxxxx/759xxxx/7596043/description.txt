Abelay Garam Bhaat reviews 

Director Subhendu Ghosh, alias ΓÇ£RaajΓÇ¥, has made ΓÇ£Abelay Garam BhatΓÇ¥ which has been released this Friday. Seeing the name of the film one may wonder what kind of film ΓÇ£Abelay Garam BhatΓÇ¥ is? I also wondered, but I thought it might be some thing like ΓÇ£Bikele Bhorer PhoolΓÇ¥, where possibly an ole man will meet a young girl. I was absolutely right, but what I saw on the screen which I never dreamt of. Let me tell you the cast line of the film. Biplab Chttoppadhyay, bibhu Bhattacharya, Paran Bandopadhyay, Chinmoy Roy, Sudeshna Roy, Lama, Dwijen Banerjee and others.
