Do not download."
,TornAsunder,2012-09-03T07:45Z,"Audio is actually seemingly fine until the last four or so minutes where it completely ""disappears."" Tested on VLC Media Player. I would probably try a different torrent if you NEED to hear the last four minutes of the episode. From what I saw, you'll be missing a bit of dialogue if you don't."
,TornAsunder,2012-09-03T07:57Z,"Actually, scratch that. The original audio seems to be messed up. My apologies to the torrent uploader. Hopefully next week's episode will cover some of what couldn't be heard."
,Yaboo56,2012-09-03T13:31Z,Audio disappears at 39th minute
,Doug1986,2012-09-03T15:49Z,WTF? No one does .xvid anymore? Seriously considering going to another site at this point. I want to download quick and watch and then delete not wait all day for a crystal clear video.
