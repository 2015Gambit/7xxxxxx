Never was a big fan of 'boogie' type music,but there are a couple of songs here that are definitely not that.Those are the tracks that make this a must.I have the vinyl,but am looking forward to hearing the cd.Vinyl was on Capitol and was not too fond of their quality at the time.Thanks so much for this."
