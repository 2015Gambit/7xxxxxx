I wish everyone would watch Moyers & Company -- then maybe there'd be a fighting chance to change this country for the better by ending/reducing money and corruption in American politics.

FYI: Video codec is fMP4 at 720p, motion scenes are very pixelated, but not bad at half size. The message is still intact."
,libertaswv,2012-09-06T07:43Z,"^ Well said, upx3. If people would just read his essays (let alone his incredible documentary work), I think some eyes would be opened.

It strikes me as odd that the religious right in America is perpetually enraged about women's reproductive health services and equal rights for LGBT citizens; neither of which are mentioned in the 10 Commandments that allegedly guide their faith. Yet adultery, featured prominently in their commandments, is well tolerated on a daily basis. No call for the criminality of adultery. No call for adulterers to lose their rights. No marches. No bombings at the offices of divorce lawyers (etc)

You'd think more people would find that dynamic rather telling. 

It's depressing that so many people who think they're advocating the 'most freedom minded' politician support people like the Pauls, who legislate their own religion (not to mention hating bittorrent and a free and open internet). Yeah... Turn women into incubators for the state because of your own religious beliefs... Those Pauls are so freedom-y! lol.

Anyway... Thx for the up, FatDragonfly! I had no idea Moyers was back - happy to be catching up.

Thx too to all seeders and leechers - sincerely appreciated, all."
