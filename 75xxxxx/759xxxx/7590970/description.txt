PhotoViva is a powerful application for photo editing and freeform painting. It can help you transform your pictures into expressive and colorful works of art.

In addition to tools for enhancing your photos, there are paint brushes that let you make abstract painted interpretations of photos. You can select a brush and copy image features by cloning or painting. Brushes can track the direction of movement, or you can set the brush direction. You can also change the hue, saturation and blur of brush strokes as you go.

App Hints

    Use large brush strokes to fill the canvas, then use smaller brush strokes to reveal detail 
    Use Brushes in "Clone" mode instead of "Paint" mode to copy the source image to the canvas 
    Use Tools->Blend undo.. to vary the density of your most recent change to the canvas 
    Use the Airbrush in "Clone" mode to blend the image directly to the canvas after painting with brush strokes 
    Try clearing to White, Black or Cream using the Fill menu before painting 
    Add color noise to brush strokes to make a lively variation in the color 
    Use less or no color noise when painting on skin tones 
    Use the HDR correction feature on images that have people in the shadows

What's in this version : (Updated : Aug 31, 2012)

    Now you can select the image size to paint higher resolution images. There is an improved user interface with enhance and paint modes, and the app uses less memory on your device. You can also choose to start painting with a blank canvas when a new image is loaded. Image processing is made faster with OpenGL ES 2.0, and PhotoViva also now links to online documentation.

Required Android O/S : 2.3.3+
