Can't afford or don't want to buy the latest version of vBulletin for $195 on their official website (at vbulletin.com)? Now you can download vBulletin 3.8 for free.

Click one of the above download links (magnet link or direct torrent download) to access the torrent. Then, copy the vb folder in the torrent once download is finished to your web server's root level. Navigate to http://localhost/vb/install/install.php on your browser and follow the onscreen instructions to set up a database and configure vBulletin.
