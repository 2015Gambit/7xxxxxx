This is a dual-purpose, two-in-one book that opens with a strong inspiration section of ideas for garage organization and use, then adds a fully developed how-to section that includes a range of step-by-step projects, ranging from the installation of basic shelving and storage features, to complete follow-along sequences showing the construction of three different garage styles from the ground up.
