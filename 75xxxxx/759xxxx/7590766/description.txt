Here are two sought-after RCA Living Stereo recordings from 1954 and 1956 remastered in Japan and pressed as 24-karat gold CDs. Both are ballet scores popularized in productions by the Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo in the late 1930s and 1940s. The sound is brilliant, especially in "Gaite Parisienne," a patische of melodies derived from scores by Jacques Offenbach. "La Boutique Fantasque" ("The Fantastic Toyshop") is derived from melodies by Rossini.
