,shane3900,2012-09-03T02:14Z,why is this in 2 parts?????? why not just make it as full movie.
,topeak,2012-09-03T02:54Z,"It's in two parts because the original source is still following ancient scene rules from a decade ago, when putting movies onto two cd's instead of one DVD was cheaper. It's outdated dogshit, but some rippers still follow the old rules for whatever reason. 

Search Fast AVI MPEG Joiner. It's a simple drag and drop editor that I use to join these into one complete file. Pretty sure there is a copy here on Piratebay under Apps. "
,tflagger997,2012-09-03T03:59Z,"It also proves that almost all the 'big groups' are just copying the same source, and that they do not even bother to watch it before they upload.  They certainly could not be bothered to combine it, which is easy if you are actually encoding it.

This is not just about S4A, but all the rest too."
,pottermouth,2012-09-03T14:27Z,"stop bitching and say thank you,who cares if its one part two parts or seventy parts its quite simple to put together you ungrateful people and best of all its free.just no pleasing some people.
