Total Commander Ultima Prime is a collection of the software and customized settings sets gathered in one installation package for enhancing Total Commander (file manager) possibilities. Our project differs from official distribution provided by Christian Ghisler on www.totalcmd.com site. If youΓÇÖd like to see and try our solution, you can download it from our servers and discuss about it on our forumΓÇÖs board. We provide our customization work as freeware in the form as it is but please remember, that Total Commander itself is distributed as shareware. Please keep in mind, that other contained applications licenses might differ and not be proper for commercial purposes too. Detailed descriptions of the software can be found on the forum board.
