During setup you'll notice some program installation, like Open Office, just click "Accept" "OK" "Next" etc... 
It needs nothing more than one minute. Then close all that stuff and leave the full setup to complete normally. 
Once done the system will ask for your windows CD to seek for some system files, just ignore if you want and continue.

Please remember after setup finish to download and install an antivirus of your choice.
