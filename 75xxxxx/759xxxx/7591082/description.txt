The Dating Guy is a half-hour animated comedy about the single life of twenty-somethings in the city.

Meet Mark, Woody, Sam, and VJ. They live in a sort of in-between world. TheyΓÇÖve finished school and are living on their own, but they havenΓÇÖt settled down yet or even accrued much of a bank account. TheyΓÇÖre essentially living life day to day. Kind of broke. Kind of directionless.

Each week, one or more of them find themselves exploring the dating world in one way or another. Sometimes itΓÇÖs twins, sometimes itΓÇÖs conjoined twins (which is way less awesome than it sounds) and sometimes itΓÇÖs a shameful night at home with the palm twins.
