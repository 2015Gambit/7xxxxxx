Thank you very much my friend."
,hotdog159,2012-09-04T23:09Z,"@bobiras22

Will make a detailed list tomorrow. This is the main stuff we will need:
alarm clock,
audio player,
calculator,
backup app (Google drive, dropbox etc.),
eBook reader,
office/note taking apps (there is a difference between the two),
audio/video players,
content apps (Wikipedia, wolfram etc.)

May think of more and as I said will put out a detailed list tommorow.

[T],bobiras22,2012-09-05T12:45Z,"@hotdog159 

Most of the stuff you will find them in my torrent.Just make a search and you will find anything you want"
,hotdog159,2012-09-05T21:22Z,"@bobiras22
While you have a point there it's a pain in the arse to search for and download 20 apps. The list is almost finished. Will post it here in the morning. "
