The story is set in a multiverse where many parallel Earths exist, one of which is Higher Earth: a world that has conquered 99 other Earths from alternative timelines. It is a follow on from Humphries's 2011 comic series, Our Love is real. The story revolves around a girl named Heidi and a rogue soldier called Rex. Rex is present from the opening scene where he is falling from the sky onto an alternative earth which has been designated a "junk" world. He is introduced as being committed to a quest of vengeance against an unspecified opponent. Heidi is introduced as a tough young woman who so far has only known the "junk" earth, where garbage is continually falling out of the sky.
