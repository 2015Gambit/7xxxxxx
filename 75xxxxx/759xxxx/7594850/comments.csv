,thedarkhadoken,2012-09-03T23:11Z,Hey Yify could you start uploading your 3D movies in full SBS? I recently dl Fright Night 3D from someone else and the 3D quality was amazing because it was full SBS and not HSBS. Also could you explain why you upload your 3D movies in HSBS? I thought HSBS and full SBS were the same until I googled the difference.

,Sneakerky,2012-09-08T18:53Z,"Yifi, your uploads are always awesome!  This one however, does go totally off sync mid-way through.  I cannot adjust it out with my LipSync option on my TV either. 

Could you try again?  Thanks for putting this up.  I am continuing to Seed regardless as others may can adjust this out. "
