Peter Tosh, founder member of the original Wailing Wailers, needs little in the way of introduction and â€˜Talking Revolutionâ€™ is one of his most outspoken releases ever.

This two CD set covers Toshâ€™s live concert at the One Love Peace Concert plus an extra bonus CD of live acoustic tracks featuring rare radio station performances. Recorded while Tosh was touring the USA they show another, more reflective, side to Peter Toshâ€™s fiery personality

The background and build up to the 1978 One Love Peace Concert was about as â€˜dreadâ€™ as it was possible to get. Guns, politics, music and, most importantly, reconciliation as Jamaicaâ€™s warring factions were brought together in an effort to stop the violence.

Tosh, no stranger to the islandâ€™s volatility, seized his opportunity with both hands. With Jamaica's most important political dignitaries seated in front of him alongside the world's press and media Tosh played what was probably the most dynamic set of his life whre, in between songs, he launched into fierce attacks on Jamaicaâ€™s political system.Nobody was spared from Toshâ€™s explosive invective.

Unique rare pictures of Tosh from the period, excellent artwork and Harry Hawke's sleeve notes that contextualise the troubled times and place the background to the concert in its historical context together make a stunning package essential to any music lover. Real rebel music!!
