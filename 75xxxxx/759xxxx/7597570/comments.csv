,STONEDSTONER,2012-09-04T13:21Z,"psspss xvid/avi files DONT WORK on xbox360 ...... hes still doing this bs you may as well use x264 like the rest for PC

Also saying play it on PC or convert is stupid, All Xvid should work on 360 or you doing it WRONG"
[V],psspss,2012-09-04T14:57Z,"i havent a xbiox or PS

vlc360"
[V],psspss,2012-09-04T16:26Z,"i think avis playing on xbox is hit and miss some work and others without changing anything on the encoder

I might go back to adv profile L5 again
it will add bvops back over L3"
,STONEDSTONER,2012-09-04T18:13Z,"Yes there are many programs like VLC360 (that one requires windows media center) that stream to xbox...

But thats not the point, Xvid should (and 99% time will) play on 360 with just a usb HDD

I use my PC mainly also, but all my Computer illiterate friends and millions of other use 360 with usb hdd

Xvid is becoming more rare these days so it would be good if you adjusted it to work

i think its something to do with the sound, Xbox cant play AC3 5.1 audio in MP4 containers

Maybe just get some sound settings from AFG stuff and use the video quality you already been using, ill test it out for you if you want

Your Video selection/taste is very good by the way"
[V],psspss,2012-09-05T03:28Z,"i only use mp3.. as many dvd players cant player a mix of divx with ac3 only divx.mp3.. since xvid
is compatible with divx 5 after all

Im wondering if its the frame rate xbox may only like 30fps for xvids going back that link above?

but reallly you should be using mp4 for xbox the quality is better over xvid.. xvid is more for older
dvd players and laptops with single cores that struggle with mp4s and mkvs espc if they are
1gb or bigger"
[V],psspss,2012-09-05T03:34Z,"this might be handy as well.. makes you wonder if somehow MS spys on what you play and prevents it playing
