Enjoy!"
,parkerdc,2012-09-03T05:19Z,Thanks for the upload.
,dellefs0,2012-09-03T23:33Z,"Thanks good quality, great show"
,Windoze321,2012-09-04T02:01Z,Where did this come from?  I don't see it online and it's not airing until the end of the month.
,elementasquee,2012-09-04T02:28Z,"@Windoze321 There was an event where a handful of people signed up to have a Sherlock Holmes-themed dinner with grubwithus and got a free CBS Elementary screener DVD. People leaked it, and here it is."
,steaz55,2012-09-04T17:14Z,"This is not 720p. It's 720 x 480. It's 480p.
It's a DVD screener not HD."
,elementasquee,2012-09-04T22:29Z,"I put DVD quality, but the server probably made it highres by itself. Oh, well. You're not going to get better quality until the show actually releases on the 27th, so--"
,billbad,2012-09-06T20:29Z,"I only got this because it has ZOĂ Keating's bad-ass cello soundtrack. CBS used it without permission, but I think I just turned into a fan of the show. :)
