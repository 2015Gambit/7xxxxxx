,charlie_lee,2012-09-08T20:48Z,"thanks for the upload, after the completion of this file i tried to install the game but after the installation whenever i tried to launch the game, my windows says SOF.exe was not found. Should I download the game itself prior installing this ? "
,evilan,2012-09-11T02:07Z,"No you shouldn't, this is the fullgame Soldier of Fortune, its just tweaked with fixes to work on windows 7 aswell. 

Your problem is a new one, add me on msn.messenger, irshaad.suri@gmail.com and I will support you to solve you issue, we can both learn from it."
,evilan,2012-09-11T02:08Z,"No, you already got the fullgame: This one.

Check if your sof.exe can be found in the folder you installed to it. If not, then something is blocking you from installing the game."
,charlie_lee,2012-09-13T14:25Z,"I tried checking the installation folder but I believe that some of the file is missing, including SOF.exe
I then tried the other torrent and it crashes on startup and I managed to fixed it by using the mohaa.exe solution. 

If it helps, the other torrent I meantioned earlier is bigger than yours, it is 1GB+ in size. 

Thanks for your help anyway, much appreciated :)"
