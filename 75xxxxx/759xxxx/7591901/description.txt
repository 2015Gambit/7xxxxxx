Here's another torrent I saved from Demonoid because I didn't have enough disc space.

This is a collection of songs from British TV during the late 1960's.  Most are black & white.  If you want to see what artists and songs are included, just click on the number next to "files" above, and all will be revealed.  Enjoy!

Please, let's do our best to keep this thing alive for as long as possible. Seed, seed, seed, and give a big "Fuck you!" to all the corporate bastards in Hollywood who have taken Demonoid,and others away from us.

Long Live TPB!
