Awesome, can you please make it more user friendly e.g. at least 10TB worth of upload, divided in about 50 parts(untouched or who cares) and then part1 to 20(at least) rar/zip  and then don't forget to prepare an other upload 100 times more useless then your previous masterpiece!   "
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-09-03T14:12Z,It's easy to say that in words but it's bit difficult not impossible. But I can't. :)
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-09-04T08:20Z,Should i stop seeding? Did anyone completed?
,asqw9,2012-09-04T11:44Z,Senseless upload. Who wants to download all these if they just need one version. WASTE OF BANDWIDTH.
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-09-04T16:03Z,Senseless? ah?. If you don't know how to download torrents then stay back from commenting on my uploads. It won't take much time for me to throw back the words in a different manner.
