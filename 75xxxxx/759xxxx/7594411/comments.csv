ElbyCDIO.dll and as such quarantines it making the program unusable."

Sorry, but trial versions are not allowed to use the update server!

The AnyDVDHD trial is intended for functionality testing only and,
for business reasons, updates for processing some new discs are not available.

And to be sure, always make sure your computer isn't connected to the internet before installing and cracking."
