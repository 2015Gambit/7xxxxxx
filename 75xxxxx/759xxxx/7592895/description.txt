The definitive analysis of the events, ideas, personalities, and conflicts that 

When Barack Obama took office, he brought with him a new group of foreign policy advisers intent on carving out a new global role for America in the wake of the Bush administrationΓÇÖs war in Iraq. Now the acclaimed author of Rise of the Vulcans offers a definitive, even-handed account of the messier realities theyΓÇÖve faced in implementing their policies.

 In The Obamians, acclaimed author James Mann tells the compelling story of the administrationΓÇÖs struggle to enact a coherent and effective set of policies in a time of global turmoil. At the heart of this struggle are the generational conflicts between the Democratic establishmentΓÇöincluding Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton, and Joseph BidenΓÇöand Obama and his inner circle of largely unknown, remarkably youthful advisers, who came of age after the Cold War had ended.

Written by a proven master at elucidating political underpinnings even to the politicians themselves, The Obamians is a pivotal reckoning of this historic president and his inner circle, and of how their policies may or may not continue to shape America and the world.
