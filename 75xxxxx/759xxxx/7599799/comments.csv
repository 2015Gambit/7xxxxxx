,dhod4ever,2012-09-07T14:29Z,"1. First of all you need the BASE game ""The Sims 3""

2. If you have a MOD items or MOD programs, remove them before installing a Sims 3 expansion pack or stuff pack.

3. turn off your internet when installing a Sims 3 expansion pack or stuff pack.

4. DO NOT INSTALL THE ORIGIN! a.k.a Electronic Arts Download Manager (never ever ever ever!)

5. When cracking the Sims 3 w/ expansion and stuff pack installed, always paste the crack in ""Sims 3 BASE GAME""

Follow this instructions and call me liar if it didn't work! :))"

,dhod4ever,2012-09-08T01:33Z,"@shka003

update you say? when you are installing Sims 3 supernatural it will update your SIMS 3 base game.. as I already told do not install origin.. once you install it.. your'e f*ck up! even if you uninstall the origin you still have to clean your registry so your'e still f*ck up. ORIGIN = PIRATES ENEMY ^,..,^"
