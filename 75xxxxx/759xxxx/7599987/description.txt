The First 48 Hours - Season 2  


this is not a tv rip or a xvid rip from scene, good luck finding a torrent or rapidgator link from that season lol, this is a amazon video on demand rip so dont get mad if the quality isnt to ur liking , its very watchable , but i wouldnt say ur getting dvd rips , and its very rare, since this is the season that has joe schiliaci in it,the best detective ever, he just walked up to the dealers and said wats up lol 
enjoy 

hopefully the speed will make up for the less then dvd quality 
on a fast seedbox for months - will be fast in few hours
