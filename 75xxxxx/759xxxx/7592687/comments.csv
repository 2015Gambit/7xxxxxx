So, if someone didn't want your entire HUGE torrent, they'd be forced to go through and manually check ""don't download"" for every title they didn't want.

I don't want to seem ungrateful, but lumping all of these different shows together seems breathtakingly lazy and destined to result in few people actually being able to download and seed the entire torrent.

But I've only been doing this for a year or so, maybe there's something I'm missing."
