,pjones452,2012-09-04T06:54Z,can you upload the new episode from today thanks
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-04T07:27Z,"i watched this on tv and it's kind of the same as the last two eps of season 3 but combined into one long special plus a little more;  there's added notes from crew members and fans plus some bonus footage of the meeting between Sr. and Jr.

if you're a casual watcher of the show this will look familiar. if you're a big fan of the series you will definitely want to check this out.

oh yea and a major difference is this is 720p and anything else out there for the end of season 3 is low resolution xvid."
[V],psspss,2012-09-04T07:42Z,i dont think asking for the new season will help they just upload the stuff they find else where Im sure not the rippers right?
,pjones452,2012-09-04T09:47Z,Im definitely thinking the same thing but by some off chance he doesn't I asked anyway. Im a member of speed.cd and they dont have the new episode either and they usually get things first. If i had a damn clue how to rip shows and upload them I would but till then I guess ill be downloading.
[V],psspss,2012-09-04T10:28Z,"i did a google search the S04E01 is up in 720p else where just not one has added it yet to tpb LOL

its been up  for 2 hours now I wont say where here though

but since I dont do 720p I prob look at a xvid"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-04T12:48Z,"@ pjones452 -

I've been considering putting together a guide on how to rip and convert tv shows.

First thing is do NOT waste any $$ on a capture card. All you need is the HDTV box, a firewire cable, and somewhat newer PC with firewire inputs.

Second thing to keep in mind is getting a reasonable seedbox. Upload to the seedbox once and let that spread to peers instead of wasting bandwidth sharing to a 2, 3, 4.0 ratio. A seedbox will spread much quicker and leaves your IP out of it.

A VPN would be handy as well when uploading the .torrent file to popular sites like TPB which are under constant scrutiny and uploaders run a risk of being monitored and tracked... Heh, or the poor man's method: just have someone outside of the USA upload the torrent on your account for you. ;D"
[T],trialNerror,2012-09-04T12:58Z,"Hey psspss why won't you say where else people can find latest releases?

If TPB is going to ban me for suggesting help, that's fine. No sweat off my ass.

I won't give any URL's, but will suggest searching the web for something like rls p2p and that should give a couple of the release sites as results.

If you want to know if something has been released even if you don't see it as a torrent or on a release site you can always search for  dupe check and that should direct you to a site which lists almost all of what has been released by scene groups."
,lontrus,2012-09-04T13:05Z,"by the look of it , it is the episode what was released yesterday .. at least in facebook it's up and by the comments in there it is what was showed yesterday
