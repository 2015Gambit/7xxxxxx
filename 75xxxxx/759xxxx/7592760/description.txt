Russia: Land of the Tsars
It is the largest country in the world; a nation famously described by Winston Churchill as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma , and the scene of some of the most chilling and bloodthirsty political plots and conspiracies in history. This is the full story of the Tsars that ruled the land of Russia, some with an iron fist, some with progressive notions of reform, but all with absolute power. They are names that live to this day: Ivan The Terrible, the troubled tyrant who as a child witnessed his violent deaths of his family, and who as Tsar would wreak hideous vengeance on all who he imagined would oppose him; Peter The Great, a giant of a man whose vision of Russia s future changed the country beyond measure, and can still be seen in St Petersburg, the city he built in his own name; and on to the early 20th century when war, family secrets and the influence of The Mad Monk Rasputin would seal the fate of the Tsars forever.
