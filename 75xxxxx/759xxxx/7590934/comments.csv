,hypnotoadtrance,2012-09-01T22:27Z,"I do not know how much longer I will continue to upload future versions of Xsplit. I have begun using a program called ""FFsplit"", which is a program still under heavy development that aims to make a free, high quality broadcaster. It is ultimately going to be designed to do most of the things Xsplit currently does. I must note however that FFsplit is still in early stages of development. If you experience problems with it, just keep an eye on it as it develops and see if it's worth switching to. ;)   In my own personal tests with FFsplit, I find that it outperforms Xsplit by a great amount. You results may vary. :P"
,CaranthiZ,2012-09-01T23:05Z,seed pls! :D
,CaranthiZ,2012-09-01T23:17Z,"i can still only use the first 4 scenes even with the crack?
any probs with it?"
,hypnotoadtrance,2012-09-01T23:39Z,"As stated above in the description, Scenes are restricted by some other, unknown means which I cannot unlock.

As I have said time and time again, I have extremely poor ""cracking"" skills, so what you see is what you get. 

As far as I can tell, all features are unlocked save for FPS, Resolution, and Scenes, which some may argue are the most important. I am happy enough just getting the damn audio above 48kbps. -_-"
,infamous_j,2012-09-02T15:46Z,"I for one thank you for this.  I think their pricing methods are absolutely absurd and cannot understand why they charge a per month for usage of a program that still has so many issues and flaws and bugs in it.

That said I really appreciate your releases as the only things I like that are missing from the free version is just slightly better audio (I use 96k) and the gamesource.  However gamesource has been so buggy now, I have been using Dxtory instead which works way better, is easier to use than the gamesource and it actually gives me better frame rates for playing than using gamesource.

I look forward to your future releases as I hope you continue to do so until ffsplit reaches an acceptable points that warrants switching."
,MxZeal,2012-09-02T19:10Z,"Works perfect, i made a piratebay account just to comment.. Thanks man."
,SR666,2012-09-02T20:11Z,"Just curious, why is it that previously cracked versions had the same inability to do 1080p and FPS, but ALL the scenes were enabled?"
,hypnotoadtrance,2012-09-02T21:46Z,"I do not know, SR666. It is likely because they changed the way the program validates scenes."
,LimpNoodl,2012-09-03T04:50Z,How come when I install it I cant use all 12 scenes?
,naughtydogmom,2012-09-03T23:18Z,"Works just as described
thank you"
,NoPistons,2012-09-04T22:04Z,"As toad pointed out, FFSplit is a good alternative. My problem is that FFSplit doesn't support capture devices so for console capture xsplit is my only option (for now)"
,CaranthiZ,2012-09-05T00:55Z,"works great..!
i hope you're uploading a new crack for the next version :D"
,CRUSADER_IV,2012-09-05T11:20Z,So do you get the delay server with this crack. what  are you essentially getting from this crack?
,Littla,2012-09-06T13:32Z,New version (1.1.1209.0401) is out already :(
,MationMac,2012-09-06T14:34Z,Does FFsplit have Game Source? If it does im almost sold.
,hypnotoadtrance,2012-09-07T08:17Z,"Uploaded newest version.

,whoisshaun,2012-09-08T23:31Z,"The hugest issue with FFsplit is that it uses a constant stream of what bitrate you choose. So for example I stream 720p at 3500 Kbps now when im sitting idle or at a loading screen Xsplit drops that upload rate down to lets say 500 or so because it doesn't need to stream a 3500 Kbps stream to keep full quality on a still picture. 

FFsplit on the other hand maxes out your bitrate no matter what your doing and I suspect a lot of people will have issues with this because they may only have a 1-3 Mbps upload and they're setting their video Kbps to 2500-3000 alone which won't fly with FFsplit. However they might get away with doing that on Xsplit it would just cause slight lag now and then but still watchable. "
