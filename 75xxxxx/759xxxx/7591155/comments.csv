Those of us who have been around for a minute have always rated movies with HD quality in mind.  So this upload compared to what the DVD quality would be is a 4 and a 6, which is very good for a bootleg, regardless of what some of the newer downloaders may think.  So yes, its very watchable.  

P.S.  A big shout out of gratitude to all the skulls for bringing these movies to us.  You are greatly appreciated by the majority of downloaders who use TPB. Thanks and keep em comin!"
