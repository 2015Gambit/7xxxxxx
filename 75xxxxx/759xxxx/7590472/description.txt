1040: Christianity in the New Asia
NR  

1040 is an explosive documentary about the rapid changes in Asia and the dramatic shift of spiritual landscape in the "10/40 Window"- the regions between 10 degrees and 40 degrees North Latitude on the eastern hemisphere.

Artist and minister Jaeson Ma takes us on a journey through Asian countries in the window, including China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. Through incisive observations, intimate interviews with prominent leaders and celebrities, and powerful, never-before-heard stories, 1040 dynamically explores a part of our globe that is now nothing less than the frontier of world Christianity.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
