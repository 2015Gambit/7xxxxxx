Information
------------------------------

In this remarkable full color film, we relive the last months of the war, with scenes from the heady drive of the U.S. Army across Germany. In the final days of WWII, as American armies closed in on the remaining German troops scattered throughout the country, Eisenhower executed a sweep of the German countryside. The First Army's push towards the Rhine yielded the capture of Cologne and an intact bridge in the city of Remagen, which signaled the beginning of the end for the Nazi regime. As Allied troops closed in on all sides, the American president maintained his objective of capturing or destroying all remaining armed German forces, flushing out isolated pockets of resistance. This culminated in the meeting of British, American, and Soviet forces near the Elbe and Mulde Rivers, as Berlin fell to the Russians. Hitler's suicide on April 30, 1945, foretold the end of the Nazi regime, the final days of which are captured in this illuminating documentary, which includes footage of the Allied advance that has never before been seen. Get behind the glossy images of war put forth by Hollywood studios, and experience the true story behind its closing days.
