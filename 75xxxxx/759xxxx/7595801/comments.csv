,ijam_j,2012-09-08T16:53Z,"thank you. this is a great release. easy to use(default settings in installer confirm works), unlocked all wasteland mission.

highly recommended if you want to coop rage. just make sure you have steam friends."
,ijam_j,2012-09-15T06:13Z,"i dont know how to reach you. but could you release latest mw3 teknogods coop? with collection 3 dlc. as patch if possible.

thanks."
