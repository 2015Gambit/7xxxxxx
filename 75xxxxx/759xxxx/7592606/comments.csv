Thx for the upload tho..."
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-10T00:58Z,"Any flicker in this ver..? In my opinion, the worst thing about a cam/TS is if it has flicker.  

The most important thing is probaby the audio. i.e. good audio w/ a mediocre picture is better than great video where you can't understand what they're saying. "
,michaelrwatson,2012-09-10T01:45Z,And WHY no sample?? You can't tell if there's flicker from screens (jpegs).
