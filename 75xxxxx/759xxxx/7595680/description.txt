Brand New Arc! Great Jumping-On Point For New Readers! Ten years after the events of last issue, the world has changed - humans seemingly have learned their place, and the utopia that Voice Alaya sought for her people has seemingly arrived at last. Or has it? Rumbles of a revolution begin to shake through ape society, but for once, it isn't human! Writer Daryl Gregory and artist Carlos Magno continue their critically acclaimed run and kick off a new year of ape mayhem!
