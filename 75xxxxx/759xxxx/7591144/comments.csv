This is Dave from Retro Affect, developers of Snapshot. We think it's awesome that you guys are all interested in playing the game.

However, we just wanted to let you know that we're a SUPER small indie studio and we've been working on this game for over three years. We don't have a publisher, or anything else along those lines, so the entire company has been running off of our own savings.

If you enjoy the game, consider giving it a purchase on Steam. How well Snapshot sells completely determines if we'll be able to continue making games in the future.

Also, look forward to OSx, Playstation Vita and PS3 releases in the next few months.

I always look up about a torrent and see if it is worth getting and then torrent it to test it out. Probably 100% of the time I will buy the game. This is one of them :)"

Just FYI, the reason I'm here for the torrent is to try out the game before buying.  I prefer to try a demo, but if one is not available, this is how I test drive. ;)"
,DoomsterD,2012-09-07T22:33Z,"Okay, this game is freakin' brilliant.  Definitely buying it.  You guys REALLY need a demo."

hope my 10 euro helps you make more awesome games in the future. Cheers."
