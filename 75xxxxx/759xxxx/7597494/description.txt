I used skidrow version 1.4 updated with the skidrow update to 1.5
then copy and pasted these files into game directory enabling all DLC
no need to have steam running in the background or all that junk...
i dont remeber the site i got this from but credit is not mine...
also id assume it would work with any version (3dm or otherwise) as long as its v1.5

here is the reference to which file is which dlc
 1E6323E1 (Top Dog GOLD).dat
 EE3FEA1 (GSP).dat
 576E446C (Top Dog SILVER).dat
 67EE992C (Martial Arts).dat
 8C79ECFB (Retro Triad).dat
 AC8D6F78 (High Roller).dat
 BCF931BB (Police Protection).dat
 C8F81F7D (Triad Enforcer).dat
 D500D5B5 (Deep Undercover).dat
 E58008F5 (Red Envelope).dat
