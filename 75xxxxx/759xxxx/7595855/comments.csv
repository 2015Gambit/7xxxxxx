,antianto,2012-09-12T14:26Z,"The installation (64 bit) works fine, but when I run the activator I get this error message:

---------------------------
SW2010-2012.Activator.SSQ.exe - Entry Point Not Found
---------------------------
The procedure entry point CoCreateInstance could not be located in the dynamic link library E:_Crack_swactwiz_libFNP.dll. "
,antianto,2012-09-14T01:22Z,Never mind my previous comment. It works flawlessly. Thanks!
,lolcats9000,2012-09-15T04:55Z,antianto: how did you get around this error? I keep getting it
,lolcats9000,2012-09-15T05:00Z,Figured it out. Here is a protip if yours doesn't work: replace swactwiz in your setup/i386 folder with the supplied crack (must rename it I found...) and it will work. May give you error messages on startup but still runs! Derp!!
