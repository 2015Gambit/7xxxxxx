Box Office Poison is a series of comic books (originally published by Antarctic Press) by Alex Robinson. It was published in collected form by Top Shelf Productions in 2001. The story concerns the life and trials of a group of young people in New York City.

Box Office Poison has been translated into Spanish, titled Malas Ventas, Portuguese, titled Fracasso de Publico, French, titled De mal en pis, and Greek. It won the Prix du premier album (Prize for First Comic Book) at the 2005 Angoulême International Comics Festival.

The A.V. club named it one of the best comics of the decade.

The collected Box Office Poison is over 600 pages long. Robinson has stated that serializing such a long story in black-and-white form was inspired by one of his cartooning heroes, Dave Sim (author of Cerebus.)
