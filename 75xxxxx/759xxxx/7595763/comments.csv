[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-03T18:55Z,"Sicanddisturbed, The Story?  So it's a Various Artist compilation then?  Are you talking about ""Music Inspired By The Story?"" The 6th track on Disc #1 is called ""Bring Us Home"" and features Lecrae. If so, it has already been included in one of my previous 2012 bundles.  Have a look, it's in there somewhere. :)"

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-03T22:04Z,"Thanks soggal! I've only listened to The Old Paths once.  I'll have to play it again soon.  And as for the other artists, I've been keeping an eye open since you last mentioned it.  Nothing so far.  I'm particularly interested in checking out IV His Son.  :)"
