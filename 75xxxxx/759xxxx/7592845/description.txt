2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Including today's 35th bundle, we're now up to 917 releases on the year for everyone to sample.  As always, please buy after you try.  It's the only right thing to do if you enjoy, and intend on keeping the music you're listening to.

There's a lot of hip-hop and rap in this bundle, but perhaps none better than "Xist Music Presents."  I can't remember the last time a finer mixtape was assembled.  Rapper Bumps INF has also dropped his latest "Pain In Paragraphs" album as well.  If you're a southern gospel fan, check out The Booth Brothers tribute to Bill And Gloria Gaither.  How about blues?  Boyd Rivers has a nice little project called "You Can't Make Me Doubt" that is included in this bundle today.  Lead singer of Third Day, Mac Powell, has just released his first ever solo project.  Scripture11 has a nice little self-titled rock album you might enjoy.  And if you like a quieter, more relaxed sounding hymn, be sure to check out "Relaxed Fits" by Roby Duke.
