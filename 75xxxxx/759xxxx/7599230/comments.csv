This is the correct --> Aspect ratio:2.35 : 1

Very often it is obvious that the makers have made the movie to be croped for television."
[T],314r,2012-09-04T17:55Z,"Excuse me, this movie I have put in a letterbox to keep the original AR and to put some of the hardcoded subtitle under the movie."
[T],314r,2012-09-04T18:11Z,"My comments disappear, so once again, that AR is for cinema. In a tv-version you can crop the movie or let i be with black borders to fit tv (16:9=1280x720) . You can put black borders directly in the movie like I did here to make the hardcoded subtitles fit better."
