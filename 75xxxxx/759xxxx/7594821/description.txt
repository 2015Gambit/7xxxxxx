This is another torrent from Demonoid that I saved because I didn't have the disc space.  This one's pretty big, and I'm amazed it's still alive.  I just completed downloading it, so I haven't watched it yet.  I know nothing about the quality.

I tried to find some info about this DVD on the net, but there wasn't much.  It looks like it's an unreleased product, but I'm not sure.  If anybody knows anything about this performance, please comment.

Please seed this as long as possible and help keep the memory of Demonoid alive.  Fuck you IFPI & MPAA!

Long Live TPB!
