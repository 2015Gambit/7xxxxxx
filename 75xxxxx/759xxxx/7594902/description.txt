Trust Kennedy, Tipps and Johnson's market-leading text, GUIDING CHILDREN'S LEARNING OF MATHEMATICS, Eleventh Edition, to give you a thorough introduction to mathematics methods and to provide you with a practical resource guide to teaching pre-school through sixth grade level mathematics. Activities are rich in mathematical content, formats, contextual information, and representation formats, which offer wonderful teaching ideas for pre-service teachers. Each of the activities is accompanied with objects (and other components) and the objective is stated in terms of students' terminal observable behavior indicators. The most appealing part of this book is its approach to explaining how to teach mathematics to pre-service teachers, and its well-balanced focus on both conceptual and procedural aspects of teaching and learning mathematics.
