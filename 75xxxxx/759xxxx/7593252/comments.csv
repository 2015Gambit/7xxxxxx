,Bali2011,2012-09-02T19:59Z,Thanks dude... I was worried that you might have family stuff going on that prevented you from uploading.
,silito5,2012-09-02T20:01Z,"YES!!!

Thank you!

(please seed)"
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-02T20:06Z,Thank you!

Can you please upload BBC post race forum too? "
,strouf3,2012-09-02T20:15Z,"Oh God, this is skysports! Where is BBC?? Oh footy, you 're such a nice chap, how did you do this to us?"
,sksahu.62,2012-09-02T20:25Z,"Thanks footy, u r the BEST !!!

,Incognito2781,2012-09-02T21:24Z,"5K/sec
anyone care to seed ?
Thanks footy, always count on you for F1"
,LimmetED,2012-09-02T21:26Z,how about the seed then!!
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-02T21:33Z,"Please seed! I have 0 seeders, 0 health and a 1 day completion time. "
,arbkcin,2012-09-02T21:58Z,"The seeds are ridiculous... 125 seeds to 2785 leechers? Fuck sakes. I get spikes up to around 300kB/s and then it just dies to less than 0.5. Do people not understand the concept of ""sharing""?"
,Djurovic333,2012-09-02T22:09Z,"Guys please seed, i have a 5 day completion time..... really need to watch the race!! 0.2 KB/s"
,mizer_69XXX,2012-09-02T22:10Z,"Something is wrong with this torrent, all fine from client/network perspective and speed is crap, i cannot see any seeds, altough TPB shows above 100, speed is like 5-10, sometimes throttling to 180 and goes down asap.
Looks like all seeds are dead and we are just exchanging scraps of data from the files between each other - that`s why the speed is so bad"
,mizer_69XXX,2012-09-02T22:13Z,"also - seed counter on tpb is going down - there are probably no seeds already but since tpb is such a busy site the refresh of seeds count is delayed a bit.
Damn.
I WANT TO WATCH THIS RACEEE !! :) :)"
,brownman02,2012-09-02T22:49Z,f*&k(*& Leechers
,IAMH67,2012-09-02T23:06Z,"Stop complaining about not getting any speed. Do you people understand the basic way torrenting even works?

Footy is not one of the major torrent sharers like EZTV etcetera with unbelievable uploading speed. He has limited bandwidth (internet speed) like the rest of us have. 

When he uploads these torrents it takes him a while to distribute the file completely to enough people to create Seeds who can then share the file. After that it spreads faster and faster.

Why are you all even complaining about Leechers too? You are leechers right now.  Leechers are the F1 fans trying to get the torrent right now. Exactly like you are!

Want to know what the problem is?

Footy has limited speed and will take long to spread the file to about 500 people who can then spread it faster after becoming seeds. At this time there are only 200 people with the complete file while 4100 people are trying to download it. See how that creates a problem? 

Just shut up and provide full bandwidth to the upload side of your torrent. No one will get max speed unless enough seeds are created. You will get maximum speed though at certain parts of the file which have been downloaded by fellow leechers. 

Also only a couple of people will connect to seeds because 200 people have the complete file (seeds) while +4,000 are trying to download off them. Most of you cant connect to them.

There is nothing wrong with this torrent. The only problem is that this is currently the most downloaded Torrent in T.V show category of TPB. There is nothing you can do and seeds cant just magically appear. Stop whining because it wont do one thing. Those who will seed the torrent cant seed unless they get the file, those who wont don't give a rats ass even if you beg to them."
[T],footy,2012-09-02T23:19Z,"BBC Version: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7593824

Race in HD: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7593209"
,g8gwg,2012-09-02T23:40Z,"IAMH67:
Isn't that tirade just a load of crap? Something is definitely wrong with this torrent. Quite a lot of people are getting ZERO connectivity to the now 500 (five-hundred) + seeders.

I have no connections to anyone over 39%. But I have about 40 connections to people with about 38.9%. This is NOT how a torrent usually spreads.

The NEWER and YOUNGER torrents - also from Footy - are showing me both 100% seeds and everything between 0-100% ppl sharing. This torrent just doesn't. Even though it's been ""live"" a lot longer.

I'm bailing and deleting the files. Getting 8Mbps on the other, newer torrent."
,g8gwg,2012-09-02T23:44Z,"BTW... Footy - many heart-felt thanks for this. (!!!)

You're doing excellent work, and I'm really appreciating it. But for once, one of your torrents (this one) isn't working for me, and many other are experiencing the same. No blame on you, I suppose - at least not from me."
,g8gwg,2012-09-02T23:47Z,"BTW, many thanks to Footy - who is doing excellent work!

For once, one of your torrents doesn't work for me, and it seems not for many others either. Note that I'm not blaming you."
,iluvjumpz,2012-09-02T23:52Z,Cheers!
,redfixx,2012-09-03T00:03Z,"Thanks footy, without you I wouldn't be following F1 the way I love to."
,Viciously,2012-09-03T00:03Z,"Footy, that HD is only race from start to finish. No pre and post race. Get it off box.bz and share here. "
,mizer_69XXX,2012-09-03T00:20Z,"@IAMH67
Now seriously - how old are You ??
Thanks You for curing You complexes by teaching the imaginary crowd of TPB how torrenting works ( for dummies i must say ).
this torrent is not working the same way the other current footy`s torrents are.
They have smaller demand then this one, but trust me i am downloading footy`s stuff for a lOOOOng time and seen mroe demand than this, with smaller numebr of seeds going like a light.
And i`m not going to go with technicalities: the basic concept and how the actual protocol works to proove on how many points You are ( even on basic concept ) wrong above since my days of killing trolls are over now soak Yourself in Clearasil and go to sleep


THANKS FOOTY !!!"
,EVO_hand,2012-09-03T01:12Z,"Footy, You Rock and Roll Bro!
:-) THANK YOU for ALL that you Do Man!!! :-)"
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-03T02:50Z,7 hours later and I'm still downloading. I have never had to wait this long to DL a race from Footy. Imagine how many days the HD version will take to DL.
,BIvens,2012-09-03T02:59Z,Thanks race-meister.
,nardoswiss,2012-09-03T03:39Z,"Same is here...Has been 6.5 hours and I'm still downloading...
If anyone cut his max upload rate - he/she is a shuck! 

And many thanks to those who keep uploading it as fast as possible. 

Cheers "
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-03T04:55Z,"Finished. DL Time : 8:40min. Avg speed: 102kb/s. Never once got a seeder, but TPB says there are 17. I'll have to watch it tomorrow because it's 11pm here and that means I won't be able to seed because my PC will be off. Will seed 1:1 on Monday."
,modena12,2012-09-03T04:59Z,"When I finally finished the download it immediately said ""error:readfromdisk the system cannot find the file specified."" I cannot seed this and perhaps this is why everyone is having seed problems"
,modena12,2012-09-03T05:03Z,nvm i fixed this problem and am seeding. thanks footy
,osvolaine,2012-09-03T08:17Z,"Thanks for the upload!

I was there sitting in Eau Rogue. Can't wait to see what a certain thing that was awesome to see live looked like on TV (don't want to spoil)."
,aasimp,2012-09-03T09:31Z,Seed Ppl!! download @ 30 kB/s on a 5 MBPS connection :( very sad!
,cvonc,2012-09-03T09:53Z,"@Viciously, the SkySports HD encode on theboz.bz is also missing the build up. badluck!"
,Viciously,2012-09-03T10:37Z,Really?. lol what a luck. Got intro and post race from here and race 720p by FTP. That is the only option afaik. Already downloaded and now I am gonna watch... FINALLY!.
,IAMH67,2012-09-03T11:46Z,"@mizer_69XXX 

If the Torrent really was broken then you would never download it. This torrent is different because of it's larger size.

Why did the torrent magically fix itself now if it had something wrong with it?

Everything I said happened and now the Torrent is working fine. Meanwhile you cannot even construct a proper sentence. 

It is a good thing kids like you will disappear from TPB as soon as summer vacation ends because you make this place much worse with your incompetence. "
,frostbite88,2012-09-03T14:47Z,waitin for 720p ver
,Candyman75,2012-09-03T20:42Z,"Footy u rule mate. Thanks for all your efforts brining us the races in such nice quality. 

P.S. Dont pay attention to trolls mate."
,chem_101,2012-09-04T01:56Z,"footy, you're simply the best.  Great work!"
,13hoot,2012-09-04T08:48Z,I am gonna skip it for BBC race on 720p. But i do respect footy for giving good quality races at the earliest. Thumbs up already. I will be back if i dont find the BBC uploaded by the weekend :)
,jr6513,2012-09-05T14:50Z,is this only the race or pre and post show?
[T],footy,2012-09-05T18:00Z,"@jr6513 : This torrent has pre race, race and post race"

by the great footy.. :D"
,Abawcom,2012-09-08T17:49Z,"okay, something is def wrong with last weekend and this weekends F1 torrents. First off THANK YOU so much for uploading these footy, you give me access to the sport i love. Second ive been downloading from you for a long time and have never had this much trouble connecting to seeds. At this point in my download i should be connected to at least 1 but i have none. I'm not educated on torrents enough to know what the problem is, just to know that there IS a problem."
