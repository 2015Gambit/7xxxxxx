River Rock Inn

Award-winning chef and hospitality expert
Gordon Ramsay checks into the River Rock
Inn in Milford, PA. The hotel, established
in the 1880s, is falling apart. It's in
desperate need of a cleaning, there are
dead bugs everywhere and Ramsay discovers
a disgusting galaxy of stains on one
particular bed spread that sends him
through the roof.
