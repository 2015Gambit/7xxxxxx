Keep up the great work! 

That said, I was disappointed in this collection, it was def not worth the 17 GB download that took 5 hours. 

For people thinking about downloading this, please know that a lot of these are mostly generic clips of people racing cars and skydiving, mixed in with a few poorly done 20 minute documentaries on dinosaurs and deep-sea diving. 

The 3D is very lacking, it's discernible but it's too subtle to really hold your interest in watching such boring, generically-produced clips. You won't be busting this collection out to show off your new 3D TV, that's for sure. "

The bluray player says File is corrupted or unsupported. I don't understand. Can someone please tell me whats the problem and is there any way i can resolve it. Thanks a lot."
