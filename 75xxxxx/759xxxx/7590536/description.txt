This rip is a (DVD-5)

- What I mean by (DVD-9) this ISO is a 1:1 rip and is not compressed in any way if you are burning this you may need a double layer disc.
- What I mean by (DVD-5) this ISO has been compressed to fit onto a single layer disc, the main film has been touched as little as possible and unless you are watching this on a high definition projector at over 60 inches you should not be able to notice any difference. Nothing has been taken out of the original DVD.

SYNOPSIS:  
A singular work in film history, Chantal AkermanΓÇÖs Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles meticulously details, with a sense of impending doom, the daily routine of a middle-aged widowΓÇöwhose chores include making the beds, cooking dinner for her son, and turning the occasional trick. In its enormous spareness, AkermanΓÇÖs film seems simple, but it encompasses an entire world. Whether seen as an exacting character study or one of cinemaΓÇÖs most hypnotic and complete depictions of space and time, Jeanne Dielman is an astonishing, compelling movie experiment, one that has been analyzed and argued over for decades.
