Just a .Bat file that removes unnecessary windows files. No virus or shit. You can right click and press "Edit" and then you can see the text/what the commands in the file are. Nothing special just something little i made that i hope can help. :)



FIRST TIMES MAY BE ABIT SLOW BUT WHEN YOU HAVE RUN THE .Bat FILES SOME TIMES IT WILL BE SO FAST YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE WINDOW (if you have SSD)

And run it more than one time to get it all cleaned.
