Pandhar'takes a hard look at how poor farmers are conned into giving up their lands to make way for a five-star hotel project. The movie seeks to present a true picture of the disconnect that exists between village farmers and the system. It also criticises the role of the media, the local village representatives and the legal set-up prevailing in Maharashtra and India today.
