,Scrapith,2012-09-03T01:00Z,"@Taliyuna

sounds like a codec install issue... cant be sure however.

couple weeks back I formatted my pc, I installed the full K-Lite Media Pack, as I do after any clean install... and never have a codec issue since I have been using it a few years ago.


On a side note, warning for anyone with a g110 keyboard or similar.. that damn freeze bug exists in this game **sometimes the keyboard will freeze and last key press will stuck constantly until you unplug/replug the keyboard**.  should be able to continue playing on after that, however its still bloody annoying.

same problem existed in dirt3, not had the issue again until now, trying to find a way around it... with dirt I ended up using my ps3 controller along with the motionjoy/ds3tool drivers, might need to do that again :/"
,nysfire,2012-09-03T01:29Z,"@Scrapith
yeh about that; motion joy doesn't seem to solve the controller problem entirely, IDK if its from my version, but the right analogue stick is apparently un-useable for camera, and it seems menu navigation is inactive too. so i'm kinda stuck with the keyboard controls...   "
,Taliyuna,2012-09-03T01:45Z,"@Scrapith

after playing around with the games settings file, i managed to get the right stick working for camera ingame, and direction pad working to navigate the menu and Triangle to accept in menus.  however the other buttons are not mapped right, so working on that.

UserSettings.ini in the games directory.

scroll down near the bottom and change these lines.

UseXInputByDefault=True
to
UseXInputByDefault=False

and

XBoxControllerAxis=false
to
XBoxControllerAxis=true"
,Scrapith,2012-09-03T03:07Z,"@Taliyuna

Strange, try a couple things..

1st, might seem too obvious.. but try restarting the computer if you have not done so.

2nd, delete the bink file you downloaded and reinstall the game.

3rd, make sure binkw32.dll is located in I Am AliveSrcSystem folder along with IAmAlive_game.exe

4th, try moving binkw32.dll to windowssystem folder.

This next step I'm unsure if it will work, but is worth a shot.

5th, edit UserSettings.ini and change RunValidation=True to RunValidation=False"

,Scrapith,2012-09-03T06:41Z,"@nysfire

Np, not sure what else can be done with the config file, seems like nothing else i changed effected the bindings.

I did manage to get the controller working though, its not perfect but it works.

create a custom profile in MotioninJoy/ds3tool, have all buttons set as keystrokes except aim and fire which will be mouse buttons ( i chose right trigger to aim weapon, square button to fire ). set other keystrokes as you like.

change left analog stick to keystrokes and bind them to WDSA

change right analog stick to mouse axis up,down,left,right

as i said, its not perfect (although much better than i thought it would be) but it works.

@Cerebral222

Try setting your buttons up like i mentioned here.

maybe someone who knows how to get the bindings working properly can give it a shot, that would be much smoother.

I'm going to just put up with the keyboard issue i think for as long as possible, i hear its a really short game anyhow.

Good luck."
,Scrapith,2012-09-03T06:50Z,"update to my previous post...

@saidinho

http://www.motioninjoy.com/download

i am using Version 0.6.0003, however there are newer versions there which i only just noticed after checking up the link for you.

@people who are saying use keyboard for whatever reason.

i agree 100% that games on pc should be played with keyboard and mouse, however there are times where that might not be the best option.

in my case i have a logitech g110 keyboard, these keyboards have some sort of bug which lucky i've only encountered twice, first with dirt3 and second with this game. and the bug makes the keyboard randomly just stop working while until you unplug/replug.

it is really annoying, just glad its only those two mentioned games effected so far that i have found.

in times like this a gamepad can come in handy, although i ended up sticking with the keyboard and dealing with the issue since this game's gamepad settings do not seem right, at least for me.

other reasons are kind of obvious where a gamepad comes in handy, dirt3 was like 600% better with a gamepad, due to having analog sticks for stearing, and even analog buttons for acceleration.   and then there are flight simulators. lol, but that's going way off topic."

Once you begin the game, you will see objects strewn on the floor (like kid's toys) on the inro screen and this means it's worked (no need to enter the game proper for testing).

Checked this repeatedly and it works for me 100% using HD Radeon 4670 (1GB) and the problem reoccurs when switch back.  So ""MIPMAP"" must be higher than minimum for this game.

,b34tz0r,2012-09-07T08:48Z,"good torrent, fast and reliable. the game works fine but takes a bit to install. unfortunatly, in my opinion, i think the game sucks (quite easy, boring storyline) and its a waste of time to play/download it. anyway, download if you want, torrent's legit!  "
,amonlb,2012-09-07T09:59Z,"Guys I have a problem here. When I'm trying to install this game I can not unack it because of low space on C drive. Even when I changed path to install it on D drive installer is still trying to (temporary?) unpack on my C which is impossible.

So the question is - Can I somehow change directory of unpacking?"

,The012Freak,2012-09-08T13:32Z,"Works perfect without any problem, but installation takes while thought you have to wait, and to which ever drive you install the game, you should have at least 6 to 7 GB free space in your C drive."

,Xazbot,2012-09-10T04:19Z,"Ubisoft this is why we NEVER buy you'r game!!!
This game is a wrecked shitty port, and have the same issue Assassins Creed 1 had for christ sake!!! The controller support is broke. I don't know how many months untill you make this port and still nothing better in a graphic stand point of a game that already had poor quality graphics to begin with.
I ""pirate"" your game I saw it sucks and guess what never gonna play it again!!! See if don't even invest in your game why should we. 
Thats why you don't give us any demo because it would turn us off buying. Thats why we pirate and don't come to buy it. You had more trouble make the DRM than porting the fucking game?!?!"
,Muzikants,2012-09-10T23:17Z,Shit game! I cant believe people are paying money for such crap!
,jagz21,2012-09-11T15:56Z,"for anyone having the disk space issue when it tries to extract to your windows drive but runs out of space , you need to change the value of your TEMP variable and set it to a drive which has lots of free space. Because before installing it extracts the temp files to the path pointed to by the variable TEMP and from there it installs the game to the path you provide. So change the value of that variable. For doing that go the the properties of ""My Computer"" by right clicking it.
Then go to Advanced and then click on Environment variables .
Here you will see TEMP and TMP (in the User variables section) defined to a path on your windows partition. Change that to point to a directory on a partition which has lots of free space. 
If you dont find the variables there then create them under user variables.
Once done, reboot your PC and then try installing the game again."
,Viciously,2012-09-11T21:29Z,"Seriousfkngly?. You fkn morons should know that it only consumes 2gig of space, installed. Cocksuckers are lying with all that 6 to 7gB shit.

Game itself is pretty taxing on GPU. "
,goran92goda,2012-09-13T01:05Z,"Can anyone confirm is this a full game? Takes some time to install, be patient.

,simon2510,2012-09-13T22:05Z,"Its funny to see how many people complaining about the requirement of space. When you unrar the file, it gets bigger. This game is in fact much bigger than 1.97 gb."
