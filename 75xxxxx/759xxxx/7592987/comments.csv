,1bad966spdz,2012-09-15T06:30Z,Works perfectly.. Thanks.. I wish more people would get the idea that MOST ppl are with 3.55 not True Blue and just go ahead and put the fixed game together the fixed eboot or whatever is needed per game..Just seems it would make more sense that way.. I guess that is why they don't do it very often... Again Thanks..
