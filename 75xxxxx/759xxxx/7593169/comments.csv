,remy1492,2012-09-03T21:29Z,"Viruses? lol, I think somebody doesnt want others to see this.  No Viruses, its a media file.  I dont have cable/GBTV at home, and can't afford to see 2016 in the theater so I really appreciate this upload.  Will try to wait for a matinee netflix or redbox release soon.  "
,ldj1938,2012-09-04T01:18Z,This file is crap.  I didn't say it had a virus it just is a wonderful display of a rainbow on your screen.  It's total BS!!
,cowboy1966,2012-09-04T05:18Z,"This just works fine. I downloaded day before,,"
,NoMoreAVI,2012-09-04T19:21Z,Download mpc-hc or vlc if you can't play FLV files.
,strat77,2012-09-04T21:34Z,The torrent is fine.  Just need to download a stand alone flash player.
,Watatat,2012-09-04T21:48Z,It works fine-

,otbros,2012-09-11T04:55Z,"This is really weird...  There seems to be a complete blackout of ""2016 Ob*ma's America"" - the movie!  On other torrent sites, there are 20 or 30 of them and they're ALL FAKE!!

It seems as if someone does not want us to watch this movie.  I've never seen any kind of censorship on a torrent like this before!"
