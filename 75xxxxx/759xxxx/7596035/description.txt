XFlow is a next generation CFD software system from Next Limit Technologies that uses a proprietary, particle-based, meshless approach which can easily handle traditionally complex problems.

The XFlow approach to CFD enables complex modeling and analysis in a straightforward way, minimizing the presence of algorithmic parameters and avoiding the traditionally time consuming meshing process.

For engineers and analysts who require quick and accurate feedback on flow, thermal, and acoustic behaviour, XFlow is a CFD software system that provides you with the ability to solve problems involving moving boundaries, free surface and fluid structure interaction on complex geometric domains.
