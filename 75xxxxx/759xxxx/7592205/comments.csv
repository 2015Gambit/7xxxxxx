Did you actually look at any o what you downloaded before wasting the time to make a torrent out of it?"
,dhanu3,2012-09-02T20:30Z,"Yah i looked i read i checked then i thought to make it a torrent. There is nothing javascript or css.
All are saved html pages of chapter 2 to chapter 17...
Click on the html page and read. Leave the few folders which contains some pics,etc..
Just click on html save page."
