Raison d’être

Jacobin is a magazine of culture and polemic that Edmund Burke ceaselessly berates on his Twitter page. Each of our issue’s contents are pored over in taverns and other houses of ill repute and best enjoyed with a well-shaken can of lukewarm beer.

Published in New York City four times per year, we feature a wide-range of writers and artists who aim to inspire critical dialogue in the age of Fukuyama.
