Preetham (Ganesh) is a modern guy who has no future plans for himself and is cunningly taken to Malnad by his mother for her friend's daughter's wedding. There he meets Nandini (Pooja/Sanjana Gandhi), the girl of his dreams (of course, love at first sight) who he had seen in a mall in Bangalore. To his immense surprise, he finds out that she is the bride who is getting married within the week and leaves because of heartache. But, Nandini jokingly challenges him to come back and win her heart. Preetham accepts the challenge and returns. There he befriends her father, Col. Subbaiah (Ananth Nag) and her mother. Will Preetham win over her or will she marry the other guy? The tagline for the movie is "Love is Sweet, Sacrifice is Immortal".
