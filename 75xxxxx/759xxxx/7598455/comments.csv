Hey, just make up some BS about his ineligibility to hold office! I thought this shit would go away long ago until I realized it's not about the birth certificate at all."

Second, we need to remember that mostly Republicans and some dimwit Demos wanted to relax the 'native born' clause to allow Henry Kissinger and Arnold Schwartzenegger to be able to run/act as president. But then, they weren't black, they were just Austrian or German...

Third, we need to remember that George Romney was born in Mexico, the product of a polygamous family. This is Mitt's dad. 

And last, but not least, we might be having this same discussion if McCann/Palin (LOL) had won. Why? Because McCann was born in... what for it... PANAMA!"

They they clarified that it will be because of the growing (and Democratic) Hispanic population that will become the majority soon. If you can't beat 'em, outbreed 'em. Enjoy your new sideline status, Hitler Youth!"
