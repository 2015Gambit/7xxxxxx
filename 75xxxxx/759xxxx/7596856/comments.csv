Why you scared to root?Its take only 5 minutes and the benefits from this are way too much.I can help you if you want.Most free games/apps have ads and there is no ad free version(only in app billing not playstore) and the adaway is here to remove all the ads from the free versions."
,dspot,2012-09-04T16:36Z,I read that if rooting goes wrong something like bricking may happen...where the phone becomes useless...cos i just recently bought a smartphone...paid a good few bucks...so yes i'm a bit scared...but any help and assurances from u r welcome....
,dspot,2012-09-04T16:45Z,I read a few articles...rooting can cause bricking...can make phone useless...i just recently bought a smartphone...spent a few precious bucks...so i'm scared....but any help is welcome...i need detailed info about rooting and its advantages & disadvantages....

I recently bought this phone and so its under warranty..the article link u have provided...just read it...it says there that once rooted u lose ur warranty...thats a scary thought for a newbie like me..."
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-04T18:50Z,"@dspot

Dont worry about the warranty.If you have root you can uroot it too.

For root your device its simple.Download this:

http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1032490&d=1335783005

Unzip it.Connect your phone to your pc with usb and run the runme.bat.It will rooted in a minute"

ok....but what do i do when i need to unroot it...."
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-04T22:37Z,"@dspot

When you want to unroot tell me and i will help you again.Its 1 minute to root and 1 minute to unroot."
,dspot,2012-09-05T03:39Z,"@bobiras22

thx for ur responses...but in the xda forums and wherever on the internet i read, they say phone must be off and then we have to press the key combos to go into recovery mode and then root it...but u say just to connect it to comp and root thro usb...sounds so simple...is it really true...and what about the others...
also pls give me the unroot details too....so i just dont panic after rooting when i wish to unroot and scramble into the wrong places...thx anyways..."
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-05T12:08Z,"@dspot 

For unroot you just follow the same processing with this file:
