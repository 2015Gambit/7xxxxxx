Soundtrack for the movie HIDDEN. 

Soundtrack was created by Thomas J. Holmes, Marcin Klonowicz and Adam 'Ender' Waclawski during last months of post production. We asked them to do something that will help bring up the mood of the movie, but on the same time stay in the background. We were amazed about the final result. Some of the tracks available below were not used in the movie, but all of them are part of the creative process around HIDDEN and we decided that they should be a part of this soundtrack.
