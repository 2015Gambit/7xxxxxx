----------
The great B-3 organ master and conjurer of sound, Doctor Lonnie Smith, has made some great studio recordings, but he'll be the first to tell you that his music needs to be experienced live. The release of his brand new live recording 'The Healer' marks the Doctor's first live recording since his landmark 1970 album 'Live At Club Mozambique'. It showcases the great bandleader reinventing the possibilities of sound along with two young stars - guitarist Jonathan Kreisberg and drummer Jamire Williams. The Healer puts the listener front row center at a wild ride of a show that seamlessly blends jazz, fusion, hip hop, world music, and of course the B-3 funk that Doc helped create.
