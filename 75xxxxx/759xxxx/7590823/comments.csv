,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:40Z,Enough with this x264 crap! Please encode an avi with divx/xvid around 350-430 MB's and the MP3 audio should be around 128Kbps! 
,OnlineOni,2012-09-01T21:51Z,"Well, at least it's not a RAR."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:53Z,Spicy Placenta!

,khillik,2012-09-01T23:08Z,"Dear BUTT_SEX, 

     STFU. if you arent happy with the torrent dont download it. if you want it in a different format do it yourself. i dont understand how people like you think ""oh well this free thing that someone else put time and effort into isnt right. so im going to download it then im going to complain and tell them to do it differently."" 

yours truly.
"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T23:53Z,"Khillik: Eat my anus! I didn't download this torrent you fool! 

I'm downloading the 1000MB file in x264 and the 350MB-ish file in Xvid! Here is the link for your convenience..

,Julyisdancetime,2012-09-02T02:06Z,Fastest download I've found. (out of 9 other torrent files) still took about 45 minutes.  But you can't complain about that. So far Video and Audio: 9 
,kaosturtle,2012-09-02T06:19Z,Why would someone not like x264/H.264 itss a way better codec then Xvid. Way higher resolution in a similar size file. People need to get over Xvid
