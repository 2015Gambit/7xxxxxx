MeSSY presents Gorillaz's debut album, "Gorillaz", compressed with FLAC.

Ripped with CDParanoia, using "-vsfzX -B" options and encoded with FLAC 1.2.1 command-line tools with "-V -b 2048 -M ~ -e -l 12 -p -r '0,8' --no-ogg" options and double-verified after encoding.  Completely conforms to FLAC subset streaM ~ standard while maximizing compression - you only compress once, so why take shortcuts?

Tagged with ReplayGain and other tags, which have been checked for grammar. Caution: Tags contained within these FLACs are encoded with UTF-8.  Check your systeM ~ support.

Proudly produced using Linux.

Enjoy!
