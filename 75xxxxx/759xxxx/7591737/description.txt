Synopse: In this romantic comedy-drama, Mike (Mark Kassen) meets Lola (Ara Celi) at a dance club, and for Mark it's love at first sight. Lola thinks that Mark is a wealthy and successful author, while Mark thinks that Lola is a professional dancer at the top of her field. Actually, both have been stretching the truth to the breaking point; Mark is a writer, but he's still struggling to get his career off the ground, while Lola has just arrived in the U.S. with dreams of a career in show business and is still looking for a job. Can their budding romance survive learning the truth about each other? Looking for Lola was also released under the title Macarena. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
