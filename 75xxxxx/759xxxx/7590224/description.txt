Description
That Kevin Smith? The guy who did ΓÇ£ClerksΓÇ¥ a million years ago? DidnΓÇÖt they bounce his fat ass off a plane once? What could you possibly learn from the director of ΓÇ£Cop OutΓÇ¥? How about this: he changed filmmaking forever when he was twenty-three, and since then, heΓÇÖs done whatever the hell he wants. He makes movies, writes comics, owns a store, and now heΓÇÖs built a podcasting empire with his friends and family, including a wife whoΓÇÖs way out of his league. So hereΓÇÖs some tough shit: Kevin Smith has cracked the code. Or, heΓÇÖs just cracked.

Tough Sh*t is the dirty business that Kevin has been digesting for 41 years and now, heΓÇÖs ready to put it in your hands. Smear this shit all over yourself, because this is your blueprint (or brownprint) for success. Kev takes you through some big moments in his life to help you live your days in as Gretzky a fashion as you can: going where the puck is gonna be. Read all about how a zero like Smith managed to make ten movies with no discernible talent, and how when he had everything he thought heΓÇÖd ever want, he decided to blow up his own career. Along the way, Kev shares stories about folks who inspired him (like George Carlin), folks who befuddled him (like Bruce Willis), and folks who let him jerk off onto their legs (like his beloved wife, Jen).

So make this your daily reader. Hell, read it on the toilet if you want. Just make sure you grab the bowl and push, because youΓÇÖre about to take one Tough Sh*t.
