,footbear,2012-09-04T21:53Z,"It's having an issue with The Hunger Games;
It wont load the blu ray Redbox release. Keeps giving me this message:
""An unknown error occurred. Please check if there is a newer version at dvdfab website"". 
Everything seems to have installed properly, I copied the replacement .dll file over, and all the licenses say ""Never Expires"".
Am I doing something wrong? Anyone else have this or a similar problem?
Other than that, definitely want to express my gratitude for this and all the other awesome stuff you provide to the community ChattChitto. Thank you :)

There were some leftover registry entries from the uninstalled older version I had to hunt down and delete. Now everything seems to work tip-top!
Thanks again ChattChitto :)"

I followed the instructions EXCACTLY as always!

I even used REVO Uninstaller Pro to remove the previous version, which I've never had to do!

Any ideans anyone???"
