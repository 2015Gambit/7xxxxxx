,atndigcrk,2012-09-03T18:32Z,"almost jumped out my seat when i saw those major sites have ur release, cant say im not a lil jealous lol"
[T],rkstr,2012-09-03T21:49Z,"I can't believe I got ""TRUSTED"" status on here!!!If anyone involved in granting this is reading I really appreciate it.It means I hopfully won't see ""is this legit""? in the comments anymore  and I hope and pray it means no more capcha 'cause I effing hate that thing :-)"
[T],rkstr,2012-09-03T21:57Z,"@atndigcrk - LOL! Yes I'm famous for being a Pirate!! :-)
I'm used to seeing my files pop up everywhere however some sites have taken upon themselves to change the file name and most never give any sort of credit. I always give a thanks to the cappers and posters and have actually become friends with a few cappers due to my mentions of them in my torrents.Seems like everyone just wants to get their hands on the hot uploads and doesn't care where it came from:
On a positive note - trusted uploader status...YAY!!!!"
,atndigcrk,2012-09-04T01:14Z,lol someone recommeneded u awwww u should celebrate today !
[V],mdprosser,2012-09-04T03:05Z,Congrats on the Trusted... you definitely deserve it!  You'll be a VIP in no time!  THEN you won't have to worry about the capcha :-) 
[T],rkstr,2012-09-04T04:10Z,"I was a bit premature hoping there would be no capcha or as I like to call it ""The Devil's Writing"""
[H],politux,2012-09-04T05:02Z,Enjoy your skull.  I recommended you.
,netrek,2012-09-04T08:30Z,"thx for this and RHONJ! congrats on your skull! 
3 cheers for THE PIRATE BAY! woo hoo!"
[T],rkstr,2012-09-04T14:48Z,"@politux - thanks for the vote of confidence.
I think the main beneficiaries for my trusted status are the users of the site as I have read that 1/3 of all torrents on TPB are fakes which is an astonishing number."
,atndigcrk,2012-09-05T03:33Z,99 percent fakes of this show on google thats why
