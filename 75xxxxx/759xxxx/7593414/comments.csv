matovicqwertz, there are two cds.  That is not going to change.  It is what it is.  Why do you censor yourself?  This is The Pirate Bay.  You can say ""fucking"" if you want to.  Why not use the shift button to capitalize the word at the beginning of a sentence instead?

,iamchrislechat,2012-09-03T09:42Z,the way i see it for 2 CDs is if someone wants 2CDs they can split it themselves. the majority of people do not want movies split into 2 parts.... that being said you can still rejoin them so meh i guess.

,mcrowley,2012-09-03T21:17Z,"  I should know better than to feed the trolls but Adamdudeman, how many goddamned chromosomes are you missing?  Hackulus has over three hundred active torrents at the moment and is a valued member of TPB.  It was his choice not to merge the files into one after downloading them.  For better or worse you'll just have to live with that.
  It is far less time consuming to merge the files than leech the entire fucking thing off of someone else and still be surprised that it's in two files because you can't be fucking bothered to look at the file structure of the torrent.  If you don't understand how you could maybe search the internet for a fucking solution.
  As for your retarded question, I don't think anyone uses SVCD's anymore (or ever has).
  I hope the Flying Spaghetti Monster wipes the shit from your eyes with his blessed noodly appendage and convinces you not to drink from the bowl of yellow semen at the next MPAA gangbang.  

  Sincerely,
         mcrowley."

,mcrowley,2012-09-08T05:13Z,"nofarting, it is possible that 

a) Your torrent software is out of date.
b) The file type isn't set up properly in your browser.

I'm not a scientist and my answers are shitty, but I hope you get it figured out.  I just use firefox and tixati or utorrent.  On linux I think that transmission(or whatever the default torrent utility is) should work fine.

For now I'd recommend just right click the link, 'save target as', and open it that way.

Or open your torrent program and put the link location into the ""add torrent or magnet link"" function.

I don't remember ever having to set it up at all."
,Sikkwolf,2012-09-08T07:13Z,"You mouthy motherfuckers are all niggers, it's lazy of an uploader, who stole this from another uploader to begin with, to not just fucking attach the files before his UL's to the fucking website. People that demand satisfaction are not the problem, you piece of shit sycophants are. Fucking cunts, you all run your mouths like you're computer programmers, or scene workers, and you espouse all this bullshit ""netiquette"" nonsense like it's gospel that you adhere to. 
Meanwhile you filthy cunts are mouth running about low quality or grainy mp3's that are put out before the fucking release date, or bitching that someone didn't clean the files well enough for your pirated video games and it crashes. 

I, as well as everyone else, have the right to bitch, warn, or otherwise deride something that's provided to me in a shabby condition. You cunts. And a video file that's broken into two pieces fucking sucks if you have a large secondary monitor and a couch in your computer room, and you want to sit back and enjoy a movie while getting over a hangover you fucking tossers. 

So fuck yourselves. Niggers.  "

,nofarting,2012-09-08T11:25Z,well i didnt have problem since last 1 week. i tried every torrent client every browser client. everything!!! all clients r full update. when i click to magnet link the torrent client opens and the file has 0 bytes and never start.
,JoXiii,2012-09-08T12:20Z,"@nofarting
I have the same problem. Whenever I download a movie or a game and click on the magnet link, I get a popup in uTorrent, and there is nothin there. Just click ok and the doenload should start. If not, just start it manually!
Hope it helps."
,mcrowley,2012-09-08T12:37Z,"nofarting, shitty.  Hope it fixes itself.  You never know...

Sikkwolf, some of us are white.  I'm not even tanned really.  In fact I look kind of pale and sick.
If I'm too drunk, stoned, lazy or hungover to stand up I'll use my phone to change up the playlists of whatever movies or music I've got on.  I'd totally recommend one.  Mine is five years old and cheap as shit.  Oh yeah, use playlists if your mouse is too far away.  If you can spell and punctuate properly chances are you can learn how to select two files and play them in the correct order.  I'm not too sure what sort of tinker toy piece of shit you're using, but on mine it's the right mouse button.  If I'm feeling all kinky I might even drag and drop or even add it to the library.  Besides, if you have a monitor larger than 24"" or a TV, why not just get a high definition release?  This one's obviously DVD quality.  Maybe worse.
Also, the uploader included all the information that you find so terrible.  The fact that this version of the popular kids film, Men In Black 3, is split into two parts.  And the bitrate.  And the resolution.  It's there.  In the little information box.  By the way, if you really demand satisfaction why are you watching this movie at all?  It's okay, but not really that good.  A bit lame.  Predictable.  Just what you should expect from a Will Smith movie."

,badbod,2012-09-08T18:22Z,"+1 for the 2 CD ,  great quality too.
THX Hackulus, you da man"
,noirfan16,2012-09-08T19:54Z,"If you are having a hissy fit over 2 CD's then there are 2 things you can do. 

1) simply join the files together as one(which doesnt take long)

2) put them in a playlist in your media player

3) find a different version

I swear you guys would get a free horse, look it in the mouth and complain it has bad teeth."

,Klatu666,2012-09-09T21:35Z,"I think the movie was a bit dull. Not as good on the comedyside as the first one (MIB2 was terrible)
Best part was Josh Brolin who did a great job.
Tommy Lee Jones looks so old in this movie.."
