,chadms2,2012-09-04T02:27Z,Looks like there may be some chapter skipping or repeats.  Or is that just me?

I see it repeating scenes too. For a minute I thought that was the direction or layout of the movie. I wonder how that happens?
Something to do with the coding process?"

,decoypop,2012-09-10T19:29Z,Hi IceBane please repair the repeating scenes. It ruins this fantastic movie. May be something wrong with the coding/ripping process?
