The Demon has been to hell. Now he's back, ready to take revenge on the person who sent him there: Sara Pezzini. As the Demon continues to taunt and test Sara with a horrific series of murders, Sara's fragile grip on her home life starts to slip. Meanwhile, the Witchblade screams for justice against another sadistic criminal who has been set free. Sara must struggle to control her own desire for vengeance. When ghosts from the Witchblade's bloody past invade Sara's home, she may finally lose control altogether. The road to hell beckons, with the Demon as Sara's personal guide.
