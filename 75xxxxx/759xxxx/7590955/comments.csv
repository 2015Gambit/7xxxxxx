I am The TimeLord and are going to travel to the originated time of Daleks and wipe it out from the Time.
Hey! You can not do that. We have a years long TV show to make."
,larssss,2012-09-02T09:24Z,k81689 You're breaking the rule of not crossing your own timestream. That would cause a paradox.
,Azrael_the_Cat,2012-09-02T12:39Z,"k81689 - you do realise that one of the perenial contenders for 'greatest Dr Who serial ever', the 4th doctor gets sent by the Time Lord high council to do exactly that (in response to discovering that one day the Daleks will obtain time-travel tech)? It isn't like the show didn't think of it.

It's just that Davros wtf-pwns the Doctor despite coming from a society of mostly WW1-era tech, realises he's a time-traveller, almost makes the Daleks invincible by torturing the Doctor's companions until the Doctor gives him a detailed account of every single defeat the daleks will ever have, and how it could be averted if put into their programming, and completely outsmarts the doctor until the doctor is lucky to escape with his mission a complete failure.

It's also unfortunately why they kept insisting on re-using Davros, except without the clever writing on his complete outwitting and defeat of the doctor, as though it was the guy in the silly suit that made him cool, rather than the fact that it's one of the few stories where the doctor gets his ass kicked, not by overpowering force but by a smarter foe."
