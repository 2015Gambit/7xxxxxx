Microsoft Small Basic - Simple Programming For Kids

Small Basic is a simplified version of Microsoft's programming 

language Visual Basic, suitable for kids and beginners. It includes 

dozens of lessons and exercises that explain basic programming 

concepts in detail.

For any child that has an avid interest in computers, one of the 

most magical experiences is when they write their first program. 

Microsoft seeks to introduce that amazing experience to students as 

well as adults with an impressive new programming tutoring tool 

called Small Basic.

Small Basic is essentially a "small" version of Microsoft's well 

known programming language called Visual Basic. Visual Basic itself 

is anything but basic, so by offering Small Basic, Microsoft can 

make inroads with younger students. Small Basic may be a training 

tool, but it is a powerful enough programming tool so that some 

users have even created highly functional and intricate games such 

as board games or even simulations.

However, the real value of this software comes from its use in the 

classroom or in a home-school setting, where each lesson is laid 

out by Microsoft in a series of instructional lessons followed by 

exercises where the student can put what they've learned into 

practical use.


ENJOY AND SEED!!!
