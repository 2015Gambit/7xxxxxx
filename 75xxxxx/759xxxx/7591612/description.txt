                                  STORY
  
Lara is on one of her earliest adventures. Lara is full of adrenaline and ready for action. She is looking for a rare and powerful artifact called The Hourglass of Eternity. The item is really intricate and worth a fortune. But Lara is not after the wealth. The Hourglass can show the past for those with pure hearts. Lara needs to find the artifact to help Winston to recover his lost childhood memories after being locked up in the freezer for too long...


It's been noted in one of my other TR torrents that these levels don't work with 64bit OS; I can't verify that, but apparently DosBox can get it going.
