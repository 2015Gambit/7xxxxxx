Look at this thread. You will see how I've created the wave image, and whereas the previous bin/cue file I uploaded on http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7569616/Santana_Abraxas_(in_Quadraphonic)has many problems as described in this Suprbay thread I've now created a workable image of the quad version of this album.
