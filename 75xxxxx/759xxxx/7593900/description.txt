--Please Seed--

What is seeding? Well, when you download a file I've uploaded
you are leeching. This means that you are receiving the file from my computer. 
When your torrent is done downloading, let it stay on. It will automatically seed. 
This means that everyone who's seeding is uploading the file, 
whilst everyone elses download will go faster.

Leeching is the exact opposite.

--Buy Original--

If you enjoy the torrent and have enough money to buy them, please do.
