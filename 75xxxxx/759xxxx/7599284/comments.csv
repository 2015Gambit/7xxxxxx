This neet the lucky patcher to work properly.You must use it for remove license verification.Lucky patcher needs root."
,rocketeroz,2012-09-05T21:07Z,"thanks, aside from lucky patcher I'm using droid wall to block Google Market while booting up, that prevent SBP shell from sending requests to Google Store to check for verification of license."
,rocketeroz,2012-09-06T23:53Z,"oh man, this app is a tough cookie to crack. Even after running Lucky Patcher and making it remove the licence verification, is still kicking back and removing itself form the list of launchers. This happens because when one leave Google Play Store access the Internet. After installing Droid Wall to prevent Google Play Store to access the Internet it works fine, but the minute you enable back Google Store from Droid Wall this SPB Shell finds the way to disable itself. I run Titanium Backup and the way to place it back is first uninstalling SPB shell, then re-installing it and finally Restoring the one from Titanium backup so all the previous changes come back alive. If anyone knows of a better way to crack/enable this tough app please let me know asap."

Lucky patcher should work fine if you do remove license verification.Droid wall block all the play store.Lucky patcher block only the program for check the license."
,brock9920,2012-09-08T19:10Z,"Patcher doesn't work.  Tried multiple versions of your torrents, none pass verification process.  The most it passes is Patch N1, N5, and N7.

Patches N2, N3, N4, and N6 all fail, everytime."
[T],bobiras22,2012-09-13T00:08Z,"@brock9920

With latest lucky patcher it work fine 100%.It must pass only some verifications not all."
