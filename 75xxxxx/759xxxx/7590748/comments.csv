,oldtimer48,2012-09-02T01:55Z,Over 6500 leechers? doesn't anyone comment or say thank you anymore? The numbers prove Yify's popularity/quality of work is way up there.

thanks a ton ,"
,zeondunst,2012-09-02T09:13Z,thanks YIFY......
,tpboss,2012-09-02T09:13Z,"seedandtorrent: to watch on your computer I would use VLC music player if you search it in google its really obvious, easy to install & use. as for playing it on your tv, you would need either an hdmi or vga cable, depending on how new your devices are. if both are within a year or two old, probably hdmi (looks like a bigger usb port) and when the two connect, change the input on the tv to hdmi (or vga if you have to use that) and it'll connect automatically. hope it works."
,tpboss,2012-09-02T12:40Z,"Quality is appropriate for the size. If you don't want the stupid 5 or 7 gig release thats true 720 but want a clean picture just wait till yify comes out with 1080.
V/8
A/7 (Quality ok, low volume though)
M/8.5 (Kristen Stewart makes it.)"
,jesse.pinkman,2012-09-02T14:29Z,"This is below YIFY standards for a 720p. Dont get me wrong, I am a fan but this is disappointing."

,Alaerys,2012-09-04T03:31Z,"Can I ask why the sound on these things vary so much. Half of the downloads I get, either br or dvd rip, have sound I have to crank to hear anything - the other half is perfectly fine. Mostly. There's that percentage that you have where you crank it to hear the dialogue, then have to quickly lower it for action scenes. "
,Ali_bhai,2012-09-04T05:48Z,Thanks bro! you are my man
