Genesis is the story of stories, an eloquent telling of the first book of the Bible, a theatrical tour de force. With remarkable energy and a gift for storytelling that can prickle the back of your neck, McLean captures the humor and pathos in Genesis' dramatic sweep from Eden to Babel, from the immense flood of Noah to Abraham's heart-cleaving sacrifice of his son Isaac. Passionate, fallible men and women spring to life in a story that has inspired children and baffled scholars. You've never known Genesis like this. Chapter points are provided for the 133 minute color film, for easy access to the Book of Genesis.
