Hi everyone:
 
Since I am of Obama, I wanted to share a recent article in the SF Chronicle which said that Obama has appointed the same people at Citibank who caused so much financial havoc to play a big part on his economics team and economic recovery efforts.  This reporter thought that he could see the feathers flying from their mouths and that this to him was evidence that it didn't matter which party won because financially it would still be business as usual.

 
I'm feeling slightly sad for all the NESARA people who worked so hard to bring
about change within our government, and now they're swallowing a very bitter
pill, while a Harvard-trained, "man of the system" is sailing in and reaping the
rewards of their hard work.  Go figure it out yourself.
 
With regard to David Icke, I never did "get" him and his spiel.
