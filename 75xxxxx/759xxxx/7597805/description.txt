Written in part to promote Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign, Schlafly's book is also an astounding revelation of back room politics. For decades, groups of industry leaders created a web of influence specifically designed to defraud the American people of free elections at the highest level. This book provides shocking insight,an important history lesson, and is a must read for anyone (of all political affilliations) interested in liberty and the right to a free society.
