,RumInMyHand,2012-09-03T20:10Z,"One year after, a worldwide cataclysmic event that wiped most of the human
race, a man struggles for survival in a desolate city as he tries to reunite
with his long lost wife and daughter. In this post-apocalyptical tale, there
are no supernatural threats, just an everyman who faces a decaying and
hazardous world and humanity's darkest inclinations. Will you hang on to
your humanity and help strangers or are you ready to sacrifice others in
order to survive

The dead city of Haventon, immersive and treacherous

Explore the destroyed, crumbling city across different atmospheric levels,
climbing your way to safety. Environments tell the story of the world as it
stood before and of what has happened to the city and its people

Unpredictable encounters

Survivors will adopt different behaviors and adapt to your actions. Some
are friendly and need assistance, some are scared and others are hostile
and will use group tactics to take you down. Will you go out of your way
and sacrifice your few precious resources to help those in need

Intimidation-based combat

Combat is deadly and ammo is scarce. Players will have to use deception to
deal with enemies. Cowards may bow down fast to the threat of an empty gun,
but aggressive enemies will put you to the test

Stamina and resource management

Every effort has its cost. Manage your stamina skillfully to gain access
to hidden. Look for resources and supplies scattered throughout the city:
water, food, gas, medicine, tools, climbing gears, weapons, ammo and
anything else that you can salvage from the destroyed city could prove
helpful in your quest
