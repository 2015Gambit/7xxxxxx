eBuddy is an Instant messaging (IM) service that allows you to...
- New major version 3.0!
- Now uses Google C2DM (push) for battery efficiency - only for Android 2.2 and higher.
- Simultaneously chat or IM with your friends on MSN, Windows Live Messenger, Facebook, Yahoo, MySpace, Gtalk, ICQ, AIM and Hyves.
- eBuddy runs in the background, so you are always online and ready to chat! Never miss a message again.
- A chat / IM message will be sent as data over the Internet, not as a SMS or text message. So, chatting with your friends is free!
- Full featured: set your avatar, send and receive emoticons, group your contacts and swipe through your chat screens.

- Please note eBuddy works more battery efficient on Android devices which run Android 2.2 or higher. Go to 'Settings' -> 'About phone' -> 'Android version' to check the version you have .
