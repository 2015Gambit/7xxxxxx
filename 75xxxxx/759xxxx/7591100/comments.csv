[T],n2kmaster,2012-09-03T01:59Z,"Thanks for the AVI copy as well,  im a fan of MP4 just not the great big ones, this was a nice toss off to a 500 or 1000 meg download. I'll probably whip off a smaller rip for those wanting the quick speedy download of the smaller mp4s. As for Mp4 reading, never an issue for me, them damn 1080 and 720 mkvs tho are the worst luck for me personally, they always play for me no matter what the os and player like a satellite signal on a rainy day."

The ""x264.MP3*.avi"" CC2AVI products are all mine.

No frame rate or even a single pixel was harmed in the creation of these files - they are exactly the same video as the original MP4."
