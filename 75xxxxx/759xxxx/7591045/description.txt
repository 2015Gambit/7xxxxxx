Show Description:
Based on the hit A&E format, Intervention Canada, is a one-hour documentary series that takes the viewer deep inside the roller coaster of addiction.

With the help of  interventionists Andrew Galloway, Maureen Brine, Joey Marcelli and Sue Donaldson, each episode culminates in a dramatic intervention where the subject must make a life-and-death decision ΓÇô continue their descent to rock bottom alone, or accept the offer of a clear path to recovery in one of CanadaΓÇÖs top addiction treatment facilities.

Capper note:
