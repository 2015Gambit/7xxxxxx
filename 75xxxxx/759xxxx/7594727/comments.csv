I use to love your work now all you are is a cookie cutter."
,mass55th,2012-09-03T16:21Z,Would appreciate an .avi version if possible. Thanks.
,mike22656,2012-09-03T16:59Z,Hey Dude if you want .avi  why don't you convert it yourself or are you to lazy to do that too. You need someone to baby you all the way through cause you can't even do something as easy as convert the format. U 1 of them people who cry about everything cuz 2 lazy to do things 4 ur self.
,Doug1986,2012-09-03T19:21Z,Hey Mike how about you mind your own it was always done in .avi in the past. Now just because everyone and their mother are doing it in mp4 he has to. No worries I've found another site that has no problem doing it.
