[T],prathaprabhu,2012-09-03T11:13Z,"I don't think there is anything to explain. Please look around the ISO names it has all editions and so the file size is around 100GB and i couldn't upload 100 GB as one torrent.

Thanks"

[T],prathaprabhu,2012-09-03T19:47Z,No problem - please google for msdn along with my nickname :)
