What is that, some kinda pc weird no-good shit?
Whats wrong with mp3?
And dont gimme no ""its all 'bout the sound-quality"" crap!"
,fidel_funk,2012-09-03T20:09Z,"Fuck this shit flac II
So you say what lossless quality, gimme a frickin break, this dope is from the mid fifties,- the quality has always been - and will always be - shit!
Only thing is that you up stuff that instead of 300 megs,- takes up 2.2 gigs..
Screw you, Josh Coalson!"
,albresc,2012-09-03T21:26Z,"Just logged in to say this: How ignorant can people be? And there's no need to be rude!
FLAC is the best codec ever, and
recordings made in the fifties can be as good or better than many made today.
As least they had no compression, no over-production,  etc.
Of course you'll never know that, listening to MP3...
Here, Fido, Fido...
Get a life (and a good stereo...)"

,selfloadingpistol,2012-09-04T05:14Z,"Quit whining! You want this in mp3? Download it and convert it! It's not that difficult. There are easily a dozen applications that'll do it for you.

One of the nice things about Flac and other lossless formats is that you can convert them to mp3 or any other lossy format if you want. The opposite, however, is not true. Post something as an mp3 and you're forcing your limited view on everybody else."
