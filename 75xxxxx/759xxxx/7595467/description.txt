If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.

Requirements: for all Android versions. THIS APP IS INTENTED FOR ROOTED DEVICES! Without root functionality is limited.
Overview: A maid for your android, to regain precious memory and keep it clean & tidy.


NEW:
THIS APP IS INTENTED FOR ROOTED DEVICES!
Without root, functionality is limited as SD Maid won't have access to all necessary directories.
This is a powerful tool! Use at own risk!

Nobody is perfect and android neither.
Apps you have already deleted sometimes leave data behind.
The system constantly creates logs, crash reports and debug files you don't really need.
The market leaves temporary files of downloaded apps behind.
Lets not go on here...

Why not get a maid to clean it all up? SD maid will help you keep your device neat, clean and tidy for you :)!

Choose a tab, press check and then either click a single item to delete or press the clean all button. It's just that easy.

The explorer is a full fledged filemanager, use it to crawl through your androids files.

What's in this version:
v2.0.1.5(206)
-Updated translations
