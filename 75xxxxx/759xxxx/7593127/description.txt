"Love This Giant is a studio album made in collaboration between David Byrne and St. Vincent set to be released on 4AD and Todo Mundo on September 10, 2012 in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States. Byrne and Annie Clark of St. Vincent began working together in late 2009,[1] using a writing and promotion process that Byrne had previously used on his 2008 collaboration with Brian Eno Everything That Happens Will Happen Today.[2] The duo had previously played together live at a St. Vincent show and on the album Here Lies Love.[3] The performers enlisted a variety of brass musicians to augment their songwriting and have planned a tour to promote the music."
