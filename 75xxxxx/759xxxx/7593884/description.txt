United States of Equanimity (USOE) is a platform for the creative expressions of Roy Layer, who was born in Toronto, Canada and currently lives in Ottawa. 
 
USOE began in an analogue home basement studio in the late 1980s. The results of the early recordings were released as a series of five 90 minute cassette tapes and eventually as a CD collection called The Basement Tapes in 2003. 

The second home studio has come together almost a quarter century later. Inquisitors of the Crimson Hexagon is made up from an initial set of recordings laid down during April and May 2012. The album is inspired by a short story written by Jorges Luis Borges entitled, The Library of Babel.
