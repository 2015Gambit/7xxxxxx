If you have a new smart phone, you'll presumably have a gyroscope sensor in it. Planet finder + makes use of this sensor (in combination with your accelerometer and magnetometer). This implies that planet finder + responds quickly to your movements and provides you with stable image and accurate readings!

The application can be installed on the phone sd card in order to save phone storage.
(open settings -> programs -> manage programs -> PlanetFinder+ -> move to sd)
