cheers!"
[V],twentyforty,2012-09-04T08:30Z,"@funpigj: Merlin wasn't aired nor shot as HiDef till last season, and that one I encoded just because of request from good friend. Honestly, I don't have good opinion about that series and combined with inability to encode regularly, as I did before, I am afraid how Merlin would stay out... Sorry, my friend. Regarding your ""Where?"" question - I have not exact answer. I know how much my small-sized encodes of TV series mean to some of you - but I cannot do it as I have done before and you should look for alternatives. My computer is too old and I must prevent loosing it because it's only thing I have."
