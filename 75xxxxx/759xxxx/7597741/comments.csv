,ITFPB,2012-09-04T07:20Z,"Thanks TorrentTracts, any chance u could upload a Cd titled: The Best of Both Worlds by
Pastor Charles Jenkins & Fellowship Chicago "
,tommycool88,2012-09-04T16:58Z,"TT, Many thanks for Bundle 35, lots of Hip hop....Really appreciate the collection. Also, Ben Tankard....am a big fan of Jazz. Can we have more jazz album?  Thankx again."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-04T19:43Z,"ITFPB, because ""Best Of Both Worlds"" is Pastor Jenkins one and only album, I can't make a discography for it. I also try and stay clear of uploading single albums. But that doesn't mean you can't still download it today.  Do a search for Bundle 22 and the album will be included in there for you."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-04T19:44Z,"Tommycool88, more Jazz, huh?  I can't think of many Christian Artists who release Jazz music.  So if you've got any ideas, I'm all ears."
,tommycool88,2012-09-04T22:06Z,Will do some research as per jazz music. and get back to you
,phil215,2012-09-04T23:02Z,"Hi! I would just like to say that I love your torrents, especially your ""Year in Christian Music"" bundles. I was wondering if you could upload the entire discography of The Swift, and if not the whole discography then at least their 1997 self-titled album? That would be wonderful! God bless!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-05T01:38Z,"Phil215, to my knowledge, The Swift has released three albums: ""2002 - The Swift"" ""2004 - Today"" and ""2006 - Singing Back To You.""  Unfortunately I only have the latter two, and not the self-titled 2002 release.  Sorry.  :("
,ITFPB,2012-09-05T03:42Z,"Thanks Again, TorrentTracts really appreciate the uploads."
,phil215,2012-09-05T04:35Z,"no worries! thanks anyway for the wonderful music you DO put up, it's much appreciated!"
,clardx1,2012-09-05T19:11Z,TorrentTracts thanks for all of your work. Were you able to find Marvin Winans The Praise and Worship Experience yet?
,clardx1,2012-09-05T19:12Z,TorrentTracts thanks for all of your work. Were you able to find Marin Winans The Praise and Worship Experience yet?
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-05T22:26Z,"Clardx1, that Marvin Winans has been a really tough one to find.  The only occurrences I can locate end up being fakes.  I checked again just now.  Nothing.  I will keep an eye out for it though.  :)"
,kbb81tn,2012-09-06T06:13Z,Thanks for the torrents and uploads. Do you think you can upload J'son Discography and Sho Baraka Discography. Been looking for those for the longest and no one seems to have them. Thanks again.
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-07T02:39Z,"Kbb81tn, they're not going to be complete discographies, but I'll have a J'Son and a Sho Baraka discography up for you momentarily."
,kwelity,2012-09-08T02:23Z,Thanks for all the great uploads any chance of getting a Israel Houghton discography including all his Newbreed stuff?
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-09-08T12:48Z,"Kwelity, I tend to keep my Israel Houghton and my Israel And New Breed stuff merged together.  And with about a dozen Israel Houghton releases in my collection, it'll make a nice little discography.  Let me put that up for you right now.  :)"
