,turtlex,2012-09-03T20:35Z,"I love your torrents Mr. Spock!  You've uploaded some great stuff.

One question:  a lot of the restored comics have an ad for GonVisor embedded in the file that pops up when you open it.  Why do you include this? Do you use that program to convert jpgs to a .cbr file?  I just use winrar and then change the .rar to .cbr.  Also, in case you didn't know, you can remove the ad by deleting FileInfo.txt file from the compressed comic.  

Again, I love the stuff you're contributing!"

Yes, I use GonVisor, and the pop-up has never really bothered me because I feel it's a superior comic book reader that more people should know about. However, in general I'm not a real fan of popups, but I have no idea how to remove the FileInfo.txt file from the compressed comic. I'm pretty advanced pc/software wise, so If you think you could explain that here I'd be most pleased to give it a try. 

Lastly, I have winrar, so I'll probably try your suggestion and see if they create files of a similar or exact size/look."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-03T21:14Z,"Also, I'm assuming the ad only pops up for people who are NOT using GonVisor. Because I never see the popup on any of the pcs I use."
,turtlex,2012-09-04T02:05Z,"I've never tried Gonvisor... I'll have to see if they have an Android version for my tablet.

To get rid of the popup, just right click on the .cbr/cbz file and select ""open with"" then chose ""Winrar archiver.  That will open the file in Winrar and you'll see a list of files that make up the archive.  Just highlight FileInfo.txt and press the delete button on your keyboard.  That's all there is to it.

While I have you here, you don't have any Cheech Wizard, Weirdo, or Xenozoic Tales by any chance, do you?

Thanks!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-04T02:49Z,"Hey thanks again. I've been working on some files since I posted the last comment and I think I'm going to go with your other suggestion. Turns out I have WinZip, not WinRar, but it works out the same in the end. I'll 'Restore' as I have been, zip them with WinZip then change the extension to cbz. It's been working out just fine and should do away with the GonVisor popup.

Yeah, actually, I have all of those. I have a complete Vaughn Bode collection, I believe (far more than just Cheech Wizard, anyway), I have Weirdo 1-28 and I have 1-14 of Xenozoic Tales, plus the Cadillacs & Dinosaurs TPB. Can't say exactly when I'll post them because I'm working on a few projects at the moment, but if you keep an eye out I'll get all of them seeded at some point in the near future."
