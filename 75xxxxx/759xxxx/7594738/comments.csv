I dont cap these.
SOLARiS is planning on picking up where Eclipse left off and cap them in better quality, but for now these are all that's out there."
,no123one2000,2012-09-04T05:12Z,"I'm REALLY glad to see Solaris and Alex picking up on these. The quality isn't great, but it's something, so I'm happy. And to hear that the quality will improve is GREAT news!!!

THANK YOU!"
,no123one2000,2012-09-04T05:13Z,"SO glad to see these back again! THANK YOU!

Can't wait for the higher quality to come!!!"
