This is not Blu-Ray. This doesn't even look like DVD quality.

My score on DVD scale is 7/10 for dvd quality.

BlueRay, hell naah - how laughable. lol

Decent quality, fast download.

If you want a better quality then get the 3gig+ version that is available.  It will just take 5 times as long to download, and take up five times as much space on your HD.

It's a fluff movie anyway. Save your HD space for the Classics!"
