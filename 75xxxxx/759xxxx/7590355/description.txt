This is my first autorun ever, please comment it. I didn't use any tutorial, it's totally made by myself! 

This .iso file contains the following programs:
-Ccleaner V3.22
-CyberLink Youcam 5
-Daemon Tools Lite
-ImgBurn V2.5.7.0
-Total Video Converter HD 3.71 + serials

Hope you like it, it took half an hour for me to understand and make the autorun with AutoRun Pro Enterprise. Made it to keep the common software I use in an *.iso file.
