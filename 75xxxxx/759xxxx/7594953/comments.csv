,Performer81,2012-09-03T14:45Z,I have the Vansik release with HD Textures. DOes it work with that. Are my HD Textures still there after the update?
,Maher90,2012-09-03T16:19Z,"@Performer81

even if you copy nd Paste,HD textures won't work it's a problem in the update itself so don't bother annoying your hands and your processor in copying big files for nothing :P"

2. Right-click and add hkship.exe in Steam Library.

5. Come out of Steam and navigate to your NVIDIA control panel. (Mine is in my taskbar.)

6.Go to “Manage 3D Settings”

7. Go to Program Settings, then 
select a program to customise and add hkship.exe (located in installed folder)

8. Now, under “Specify the settings for your program,” scroll down to “Threaded Optimisation” and change to ON.

9. Apply these setting

10. Reattempt to run Sleeping Dogs from steam. You will see  the HKShip.exe window, within a few seconds, it will appear to over-ride itself and the opening credits for the game will begin.
Enjoy the game !!!
