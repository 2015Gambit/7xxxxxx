I have scanned this odd illustrated magazine for you. Do give it a try. The editorial runs like this:

"There was a boy in my school who passed gas like his life depended on it. Sure, we all farted a few times a day, bl!t this guy farted as if he were being propelled through the day solely by the power of his wind. His farts weren't always noisy: their silence and smelliness were in inverse proportion (he fed his belaboured intestinal bacteria a huge daily breakfast of rice and boiled eggs). In our geeky cruelty, we dubbed him H.S (a la Hydrogen Sulphide).
It was a good thing for H.S that he was super at studies and a talented pace boweler. .. er. .. bowler, which cancelled out the unpopularity of his flagrant (and distinctly non-fragrant) flatulence. Also, we found him hilarious. H.S's farts were designed to break tension and spread laughter in our otherwise mirthless classrooms. If there's an H.S in your class, be extra nice to him or her. They aren't farting around intentionally or with malice, you know. Besides, without their friendly eruptions, imagine how dull school life would be!
I'm told that Albert Einstein (whose birthday it is this month!) was also a sucker for gassy humour. He laughed the most at someone letting a loud one rip through his lecture sessions. In this disgusting new Brainwave, we mimic other such historic nerds and stick our noses in the expansive business of gas. We also sniff out moonlighting starlets, misleading mayors, hungry birds and a horrifying, noodly Lurker at the Threshold, so tread lightly, fellow farter!"
