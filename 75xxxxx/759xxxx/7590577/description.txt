ΓÇ£IDWΓÇÖs Smoke and Mirrors concluded this week with its fifth issue.  Since it started, this has been my go-to book for fun.  ItΓÇÖs a reasonably simple story, but itΓÇÖs well told and is full of wildly creative ideas.  It doesnΓÇÖt make you think too hard, but it sets your imagination racing.  ItΓÇÖs comic book comfort food.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£ThereΓÇÖs a few mini-series ending this week, but one that I will definitely miss each month is Smoke and Mirrors. The story of a magician lost in a world where magic really exists has not only been an entertaining story, but a heartfelt one at that.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£If you havenΓÇÖt been reading this fantastic story issue-to-issue, then youΓÇÖve been missing out on the best show in town.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£IDW has been doing a lot right lately with its new books. Night of 1000 Wolves, The Hypernaturals, ExterminationΓÇª theyΓÇÖre quietly putting out some of the best comics in the business right now. But even by that standard, Smoke and Mirrors is something genuinely special: a new twist on an old idea.ΓÇ¥
