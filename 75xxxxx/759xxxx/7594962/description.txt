Book Description

ΓÇ£This is a must-have work for anybody in information security, digital forensics, or involved with incident handling. As we move away from traditional disk-based analysis into the interconnectivity of the cloud, Sherri and Jonathan have created a framework and roadmap that will act as a seminal work in this developing field.ΓÇ¥
ΓÇô Dr. Craig S. Wright (GSE), Asia Pacific Director at Global Institute for Cyber Security + Research.

ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like a symphony meeting an encyclopedia meeting a spy novel.ΓÇ¥

On the Internet, every action leaves a markΓÇôin routers, firewalls, web proxies, and within network traffic itself. When a hacker breaks into a bank, or an insider smuggles secrets to a competitor, evidence of the crime is always left behind.

Learn to recognize hackersΓÇÖ tracks and uncover network-based evidence in Network Forensics: Tracking Hackers through Cyberspace.Carve suspicious email attachments from packet captures. Use flow records to track an intruder as he pivots through the network. Analyze a real-world wireless encryption-cracking attack (and then crack the key yourself). Reconstruct a suspectΓÇÖs web surfing historyΓÇôand cached web pages, tooΓÇôfrom a web proxy. Uncover DNS-tunneled traffic. Dissect the Operation Aurora exploit, caught on the wire.

Throughout the text, step-by-step case studies guide you through the analysis of network-based evidence. You can download the evidence files from the authorsΓÇÖ web site (lmgsecurity.com), and follow along to gain hands-on experience.

Hackers leave footprints all across the Internet. Can you find their tracks and solve the case? Pick up Network Forensicsand find out.
