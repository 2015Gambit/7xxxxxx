High Diner is a Boston-based psychedelic rock band based primarily upon the songwriting of California-born 22-year-old John Murphy. High DinerΓÇÖs retro pop music refuses to be confined by any categorization with the band experimenting with different sounds and instruments and going a completely new direction with each song.

The band first started getting attention when they shared the energetic and upbeat tune ΓÇ£C.K.F. ΓÇ¥ but didnΓÇÖt really start turning heads until the the release of their self-produced and self-released debut LP ΓÇ£Purple CreekΓÇ¥ in July 2012.
