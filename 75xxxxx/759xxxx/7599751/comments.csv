There are also songs that are more spiritual in general than specifically oriented toward American liberty, like ""Amazing Grace"" (Willie Nelson's version) and the Carter Family's ""Can the Circle Be Unbroken."" And there are songs that are more a celebration of freedom than anything else, like Sly & the Family Stone's ""Stand!,"" Martha & the Vandellas' ""Dancing in the Street,"" and Bruce Springsteen's live cover of ""Chimes of Freedom."" Some of the more interesting cuts are ones in which the compilers obviously used their noggins and dug up cool items that weren't expected clichĂŠd classics, like Count Basie's ""Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?,"" the Golden Gate Quartet's goofy post-nuclear ode ""Atom and Evil,"" the Almanac Singers' version of Woody Guthrie's ""Union Maid"" (with both Seeger and Guthrie), Kay Kyser's ""Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,"" and Gene Autry's ""The Death of Mother Jones"" (yes, he really did sing a song with that title). There's still, in the end, too high a quotient of the earnest feel-good breast beating imbued in much American patriotic music. There's nonetheless, to be sure, also much classic and seminal American popular music, though it might be better heard by sampling individual favorites than getting through the whole melting pot at once.
