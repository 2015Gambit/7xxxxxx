Jon Stewart is funny, but Rick Mercer is FUN. Season 9 starts here.
Ep 8 Installing 200' electrical tower & Power WheelChair Soccer.
And don't forget about the rants! Nice grafitti too ...
Spread the net.
From the web site, converted losslessly (see below for how to).

Anonymous no longer, I increase fortitude to put my head above parapet ...

CC2AVI stands for - "Container Conversion To AVI".
Lots of options, lots of choices - if it all goes wrong for you, leave a comment ...

Cool toys:

FLV Extract 1.6.2
DVBPortal MP4Muxer 0.9.3.0
MP4Cam2AVI 2.98
AtomicParsley win32-0.9.0 {not used in this example}
VirtualDub 1.(whatever floats your boat)

Container changes galore!

Here's:
*.FLV (demux) to:
*.264 + *.AAC (remux) to:
*.MP4 (CC2AVI) *.AVI {W/MP3}
Restore correct frame rate.

And all COMPLETELY lossless!

On older (non x264/AAC) FLVs, the AVI creation is a one step process.
Run FLVExtract and drag your FLV onto it ...
And a complete AVI plus a seperate MP3 audio file are created directly.

Many current FLV files are x264/AAC (codecs of choice for MP4)
The ones I've tried so far show a frame rate of 25 - they are wrong.
The real frame rate is 29.970 (so far).
So, I use VirtualDub 1.4.13 (had a bad audio experience with 1.5)
But any version should work just fine.

Run FLVExtract
drop (one or more) FLV file(s) onto it & wait for the green check mark(s).
Run MP4Muxer
add *.264
add *.AAC
hit "multiplex"
Run MP4Cam2AVI
recommend converting audio to MP3 (VLC can't find AAC inside AVI),
from the drop down menu upper right.
Select file left pane then press "Start" lower right.
Returns "videoOut.avi" - can't do the name, but retains time/date stamp.
Drop "videoOut.avi" into VirtualDub - set video to "direct stream copy".
pulldown video - Frame Rate - Change to - 29.970
Save as (filename).AVI

Tada! you now have an AVI, just like the Goddess of all reality intended!
