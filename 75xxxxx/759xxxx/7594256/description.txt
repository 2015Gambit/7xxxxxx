Storyline:
A brutal and realistic war film focuses on the lives of a squad of 14 U.S. Army soldiers of B Company, 3rd Battalion, 187th Infanty Regiment, 101st Airborne Division
during the brutal 10 day (May 11-20, 1969) battle for Hill 937 in the A Shau Valley of Vietnam.
As they try again and again to take the fortified hill held by the North Vietnamese, and the faults and casualties.
The battle was later dubbed "Hamburger Hill" because enemy fire was so fierce that the fusillade of bullets turned assaulting troops into shreded hamburger meat.
