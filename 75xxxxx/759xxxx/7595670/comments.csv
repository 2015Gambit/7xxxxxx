,klamb213,2012-09-06T19:25Z,"Worked once, then started asking for a license, don't wast your time :("
,XerliX,2012-09-07T12:28Z,that's bullshit. Why only your comment? LOL It's working fine for everyone else with no hitches or nags.

,klamb213,2012-09-07T19:45Z,Dude I dom't know what your problem is or why you're all defensive. Just stating what happened to me.
,XerliX,2012-09-08T00:31Z,"i'm using win7 64-bit with all the latest updates & there are no issues & no one else is reporting problems. 

All i know is that some people will discourage its use in order to promote sales. Yet 50 usd for this program is stealing $ from people. You can download isboxer for free, and pay $15 for 3 months of usage, and it smokes pwnboxer 100 % as multiboxing software.

This is a good free alternative for those that do not have $50 disposable income for something as simple as raf."
