If you appreciate my work you can leave a commnent and seed this for as long you can to help me upload more.


If you get abnormal playback results, even with the Normal voice effect, your
device may not be able to record properly in stereo mode. To rule this out, within the app, try selecting the 44100 mono (or 22050 mono) recording mode, via Menu->Prefs.

Note: Dalek voices are actually labeled as: Cyborg I, Cyborg II, and Cyborg III in the actual app.

NOTE: When recording, try using different recording volume levels (look for the recording volume control within the app) in order to find the levels that work best for your device. The default recording level of 1 may not be optimal for your device, so you may need to play around with that setting to get good recordings..

If you hear excessive static during playback, try lowering your recording volume and make a new recording using this lower recording volume setting.
