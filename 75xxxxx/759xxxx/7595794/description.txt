Ni Hao Macau!

This is the Macau International Airport from Thai Creation converted to FSX by A_A Sceneries.

It is very detailed and it looks superb at night.

I urge you to try and buy, because it is one of the most recently released afordable sceneries in simMarket (about 19Γé¼), and because the guys that made this deserve their credit.

The installation is very easy. Just drop the folders inside your main FSX folder and add manually within FSX. Make sure that you add the landclass folder first so it stays below the scenery folder. A small manual is in the Docs folder.

Nice landings and have fun!
