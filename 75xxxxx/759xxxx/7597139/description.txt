Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this special Labor Day 2012 broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with broadcaster, film-maker, former Wall Street stock broker and financial television program host Max Keiser, former special agent of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service and IRS whistleblower, Joe Banister and his attorney, Robert Bernhoft, and pharmacist and GCN host of the radio show The Bright Side, Ben Fuchs.

In this case "special broadcast" means consisting entirely of previously aired material.
