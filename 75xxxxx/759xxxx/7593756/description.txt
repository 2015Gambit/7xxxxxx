Anonymous no longer, I increase fortitude to put my head above parapet ...

Lots of options, lots of choices - if it all goes wrong for you, leave a comment ...

Cool new toys:

FLV Extract 1.6.2
DVBPortal MP4Muxer 0.9.3.0

And old favorites:

MP4Cam2AVI 2.98
AtomicParsley win32-0.9.0 {not used in this example}
VirtualDub 1.(whatever floats your boat)

Container changes galore!

Here's:
*.FLV (demux) to:
*.264 + *.AAC (remux) to:
*.MP4 (CC2AVI) *.AVI {W/MP3}
Restore correct frame rate.

And all COMPLETELY lossless!

Many current FLV files are x264/AAC (codecs of choice for MP4 also)
The ones I've tried so far show a frame rate of 25 - they lie.
The real frame rate is 29.970 (so far).
So, I use VirtualDub 1.4.13 (had a bad audio experience with 1.5)
But any version should work just fine.

Run FLVExtract
drop (one or more) FLV file(s) onto it & wait for the green check mark(s).
Run MP4Muxer
add *.264
add *.AAC
hit "multiplex"
Run MP4Cam2AVI
recommend converting audio to MP3 (VLC can't find AAC inside AVI),
from the drop down menu upper right.
Select file left pane then press "Start" lower right.
Returns "videoOut.avi" - can't do the name, but retain time/date stamp.
Drop "videoOut.avi" into VirtualDub - set video to "direct stream copy".
pulldown video - Frame Rate - Change to - 29.970
Save as (filename).AVI

Tada! you now have an AVI, just like the Goddess of all reality intended!
