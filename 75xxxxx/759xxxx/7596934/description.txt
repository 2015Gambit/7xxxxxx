FOX Fall Preview 2012

A sneak peak of new and returning shows on FOX's prime-time lineup for the 2012-2013 season. Hosted by Ike Barinholtz of The Mindy Project.

Shows briefly featured:
- Bones

- Raising Hope
- Ben and Kate
- New Girl
- The Mindy Project
- The X Factor

This aired on FOX HD in Canada. This was recorded using analog, and the video quality is poorer than normal. So overall something like V7, A8: watchable but not great.
