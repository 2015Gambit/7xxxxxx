,arthasftw1,2012-09-03T20:56Z,"this torrent file has been up since the 19th of Aug (albeit on different sites) aka it's been there over a week before the books release and in none of those sites has it had any seeders, my guess is that the files a fake.

It'll be a bit longer before we get a real version but an audiobook version is available on audible which gives you a free audiobook when you sign up for them under some promo code thing upon which you can just stop the account and you've got yourself a free uploadable book

I'd do this but I've already made an account with them for a different book"
