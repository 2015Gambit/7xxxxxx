The story is symbolic ,as to how marriages are being misused in India since 1938,whence even the independence of India stands threatened and that is why the movie was released in 1974.The 1947 "Tryst with Destiny",stands reverted due to men doing second marriages on the sly and previously in 1757 too the country's independence was taken away by attacking its economy,its women and its religion.Rekha plays an heiress and Navin Nischol ,the forest conservator with the tribals.The backdrop was chosen due to the environment based religion of Hinduism.However in this movie Navin Nischol only plays the role of doing several marriages ,to reveal the modus operandi of crooks playing with the sacred institution of marriage.
