,danwat1234,2012-09-09T21:05Z,"@subph, what are you talking about? On any of the images you can zoom in to a single word in the text and it is still quite eligible. This is not a low quality scan. Great for viewing on a PC, tablet, smart phone, printing it out, whatever."
,danwat1234,2012-09-09T21:07Z,"But I have noticed that pages in the book are not in the same spot in the image. You'd need to crop each image so that it would print nicely, but otherwise it's a great copy of the book, I think"
