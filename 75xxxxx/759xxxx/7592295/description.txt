 Inside Out is the Edgar Broughton Band's fourth album,

 following the success of 1970's self-titled release.

 Although the humor and novel attributions of the group 

 aren't quite as prevalent here as in the band's first 

 few albums,Inside Out still has plenty of distinguishing

 characteristics, both musically and lyrically,to hold it

 together."Chilly Morning Mama" and the tawdry "Gone Blue" 

 add crass humor to instrumental improvisation in perfect
 
 Broughton-like style, enriched by Edgar Broughton's vocal

 snarl.The group's bizarre and sometimes creepy brand
 
 of rigid, sonic blues-rock is anything but structured,
 
 which makes halfhearted attempts such as "The Rake"

 and "Totin' This Guitar" relinquish some appeal.

 "It's Not You" is a singable chant which drips with campy
 
 theatrics, while on the other side of the coin 

 "I Got Mad" and "They Took It Away" make for a couple of
 
 the album's more conventional cuts.
