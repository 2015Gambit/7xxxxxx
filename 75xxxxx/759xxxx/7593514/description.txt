The Hunger Games (2012) Your Grandkids will never know such bounty...

...unless you STAND AND UNVIOLENTLY FIGHT FOR THEIR FUTURE, NOW.

Plan Armageddon business as usual?  Or,

Plan B - close coal plants now?  Uh, NOW, by 2022 in US, UK, Germany, and 2032 in China, India, the rest.

How?  Consumers of global warming fuels no longer get to dump for free - Fee and 100% Dividend to all tax payers.  See Dr. James Hansen's "Storms of My Grandchidren,"  or read the proposals of Reagan's Sec. State Geo. Schultz, or Rep. Cong. Inglis.

No, but HOW?  Oh.  Well, the same way loving parents, older brothers, older sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents... got rid of Mubarak in Egypt so the young would have a future.  Simple.  You get off your ass, stay off your ass, place your ass in the way of the harm, take whatever consequences including death are dealt you, without returning inhumanity for inhumanity, insanity for insanity... until you get what is rightfully yours, and your children's.  And you keep doing it till you win.

"First they ignore you.  Then they laugh at you.  Then they fight you.  Then you win."  Gandhi

That's the way human progress throughout human history.  

The question is, are there any 'human' adults left to repeat the process?

If it's to be, it's up to thee.
