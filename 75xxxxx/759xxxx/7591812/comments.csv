[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-02T21:35Z,"Hey biodevice, I have 3 or the 4 issues of the original Mystery Men series and the two-part movie adaptation. I left them out because one is incomplete and I just didn't care for the other one. I believe I have the missing original issue in a box around here somewhere. If I run into it at some point I'll scan it and post the complete mini-series.

Glad you dig the Carrot. Definitely an original, even unique, book."
