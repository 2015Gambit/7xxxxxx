,777plus111,2012-09-04T04:43Z,Can you provide slightly more detailed instructions on how to use the patch? Preemptive thanks. 
,ZombieWarez,2012-09-04T05:22Z,"Can't get any more detailed lol But I'll try...Ok so after you have downloaded the RAR file you Extract it to where ever you want it...your desktop for example so you know where it is or create a new folder on your desktop and extract it there. Once you have extracted it double click on the file and once again extract the file in the same location then you should see two file one is the WinZip Registry Optimizer 2.0 Installation and another folder labeled ""Crack"" Run the installation first and once that is done and it starts up just simply stop the registry scan if it starts and close the program. After that Open the ""Crack"" folder and right click on the exe and select ""CUT"" then go to where winzip installed which would be somthing like  Computer/OS C/Program files or Program files (x86)/Winzip Registry Optimizer and you'll see a bunch of different  files and simply right click and select ""PASTE"" It may ask you if you are sure if you want to continue with that action or ask for admin right and select ok.Once the crack exe. file is there then double click on it and a programe should start up and then simply hit PATCH and that's it! close the crack and go back and open WinZip Registry Optimizer and you'll have the full program. Make Sure to have antivirus turned off wile you do this or it wont let you install it"
