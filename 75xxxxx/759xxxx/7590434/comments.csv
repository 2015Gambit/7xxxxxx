,misspellar1,2012-09-03T10:12Z,No offense meant but I thought this didn't come out until Sept 14? 
,ofpirate,2012-09-05T08:34Z,Totally legit - flawless to all but the most highly of trained eyes!
,HAZE612,2012-09-11T18:14Z,"Personally I love these flawless files.  No matter what the size I want it to be crisp.  Especially when you can buy a 2TB HD for about 100 bucks.

Thanks for the upload!"

,harvee021,2012-09-16T03:23Z,The File is Too Big! =(
