Up with Chris Hayes; Saturday, September 1, 2012.

Chris and the panel dissected Mitt Romney's speech to the Republican National Convention Thursday night. They also discussed the theme of nostalgia that seemed to permeate the entire RNC, and Chris and his guests delved into the role of fact-checkers in the presidential campaign. Plus, they examined the rise of single-newspaper towns and the changing local media landscape in the all-important swing states.

Joining Chris on the panel were:

Josh Barro ("writer of Bloomberg View's "The Ticker"), David Sirota (writes a nationally syndicated weekly newspaper column and hosts a radio show, "The Rundown with Sirota and Brown"), Ana Marie Cox (columnist for "The Guardian" and founder of the political blog Wonkette), Bob Herbert (distinguished senior fellow at Demos and former New York Times columnist.)

Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell (D), (NBC News political analyst and CNBC contributor, author "A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great") joined later via satellite to talk local media.
