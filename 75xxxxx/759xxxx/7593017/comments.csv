,oneneo,2012-09-02T20:36Z,"Something seems to be wrong in-game. The controls are kind of out of whack when you use a controller (X-box 360 controller). 

Even after enabling gamepad, I have to use the keyboard to move around menus, and the onscreen guide for using the gamepad are completely wrong.

Hoping for an update or something to make the game more playable.

However, thanks for uploading it anyway, man. Appreciate it."

However after like 5-10 minutes, my whole keyboard locks up.. Even if I manage to close the game by shutting down the computer then canceling the shutdown, the keyboard no longer works until I restart.

I don't recommend downloading this one.. it's either a virus, or a bad crack! It smelt kinda fishy right from the start tbh.."

Having an issue with a laggy mouse though, haven't found a fix yet.  Probably just need to enable hardware mouse, disable smoothing or some bullshit in an ini since the in-game options appear lacking.  Considering what I've read about this not being released on PC, a patch seems unlikely."

At some point it writes ""CPU performance might be too low"" in it and stops. The game doesn't launch, and there's nothing I can do even to change the size of the window. Partion of the text there is invisible due to the size... maybe there is a button there? Anybody had similar issues? "

I truly scanned this with 3 programs Malwarebytes, Kaspersky and Trojan Remover. This game is different and unique. It is well worth the DL if you want something new. The game is 3rd person running and first person shooting. Simply put, brilliant. Thanks again for the awesome torrent.

How I install my games: 
1: scan file first with everything I got!
2: open with magic iso
3: extract to a new folder
4: run setup as admin
5: crack game
6: scan game once more
7: enjoy the free game & buy it if its good"

,Mysterious2k10,2012-09-03T22:36Z,"okay I decided to mess around with this a little more. The installation still freezes, but works if you just let it do its thing. As for my keyboard locking up: seems I can fix that by re-inserting the keyboard during game play, until it happens again at which point I just repeat.

It seems like I'm the only one facing this issue so far, so it may be something wrong on my end, but still.. just a heads up :P"

**ATI VIDEO CARD TEXTURE GLITCH SOLVED!!**
==================================

Go into Cataylst Control Centre > go to the ""MIPMAP (Detail Level)"" parameter > set this to SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE MINIMUM SETTING.

Once you begin the game, you will see objects strewn on the floor (like kid's toys) on the inro screen and this means it's worked (no need to enter the game proper for testing).

Checked this repeatedly and it works for me 100% using HD Radeon 4670 (1GB) and the problem reoccurs when switch back. So ""MIPMAP"" must be higher than minimum for this game.

No need to thank me, I know I'm universally loved ^_^"

I'm not new to torrents, ISOs or installing software on a PC, so I'm fairly certain that the problem is with the installer and not at my end. Is there a work around to this, or am I going to have to download a different ISO to be able to install to a custom path?"

It's definitely not a ""free roamer"". You can take only one path, everything (!) is already thought for you.
Another thing, this game is ridiculously buggy. For example, there is a scene with first fight. Sometimes the enemy is scared, sometimes not. You have to push him off the ledge - but sometimes you can't, you have to move from left to right to find a ""perfect"" position.
Another thing, it's a really bad console port. It looks bad, works bad, feels bad.
