Classics is a greatest hits album released by Hybrid. The album contains songs from 
Hybrid's previous studio albums and also contains a cover of "Enjoy the Silence", 
originally done by Depeche Mode. The cover was a result of a fan poll, where fans 
could suggest songs for Hybrid to cover. The album was originally due for autumn 2011, 
but ended up being delayed until July 30, 2012. The album was released, both as a 
standard CD, as well as a 4-disc box set, which contains previously unreleased 
material. The box set was originally limited to 300 copies, however the number was 
increased to 500. Distinct'ive stated that the deluxe edition will see a digital 
release at some point in the future, due to public demand. A 5th disc was only 
made available to the first 40 orders of the deluxe edition.
