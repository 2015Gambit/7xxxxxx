This is a hardcoded version of Yify's 720p release of The Sum Of All Fears. I take NO credit for sourcing or
encoding the original film. The only thing I did was add hardcoded subtitles for the non English speaking
parts. (To me it looks like the audio at the end is literally off by a fraction of a second and I can't seem
to fix it. But every where else it's perfectly fine.)

I am well aware that my encoding skills are NO WHERE near as amazing as the Yify teams. The quality
is still there. The audio is Stereo 96KB. I also realize my 720p is the size of their 1080p.

I hardcoded these subs for myself out of need. I decided to upload this because I figure I cannot be
the only person out there that streams videos to their TV and hates it that the SRT sub files do not get 
picked up.

I appreciate anyone that downloads and seeds. Please remember, sharing is caring. Thank you.

Original encode done by Yify himself!

Any hardcodes I do, are only done with the explicit expressed permission by Yify himself or his
team members. I will ALWAYS give the credit to the original encoders unless I use a source of my own.
