,admz0r,2012-09-03T00:40Z,"^oh and forgot to say if u have already Sunlit Tides dont download the following two: -MassageTableClassic
-saunaClassic
Since they r in that new neighborhood already (deluxe version), you can download it from here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7574761/Sims_3_Neighborhood_-_Sunlit_Tides"

,admz0r,2012-09-05T18:16Z,@xboxuser11: sure you can use packs from the previous years ;)
,xboxuser11,2012-09-05T22:19Z,"@admz0r
Thanks for answer .... just to be sure, if I compare ex. the June pack from other poster, that's really not the same size, and if I compare the sim3pack, that's not the same ...I  just dont't want to do a mess with the game...!!"

,BillA1016,2012-09-06T00:52Z,Thanks for uploading this! Does anyone know where to put these files? I've never used any of these fixers before.

,admz0r,2012-09-06T02:53Z,@xboxuser11: im sure its gonna work.
,xboxuser11,2012-09-06T14:24Z,"@admz0r
Thanks for answer! so if for any reason in some package I find duplicate item, the game will take care of it right? I don't use the sim3pack anywayz, just the pack exept for the building and the neighbordhood (sorry for me english, i'm french!) 
Just curious.... in some other poster (rachel), why this poster don't have a fix folder, when your torrent have one? just trying to understand!!
Thanks again!"
