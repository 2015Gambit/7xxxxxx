Ya know, my introduction to comic books was Cerebus and Elfquest in the early 80s (1982 to be exact). Shortly after that I got into Savage Sword of Conan and Heavy Metal (because they were magazine size like Elfquest was at that time). After that I never really got into ""regular"" comic books. I've always been an underground, independent, alternative reader and collector. Sandman got me started on the Vertigo stuff (my LCS guy recommended Sandman for me right around issue five, I believe). So when I realized I could have some of this stuff in a digital format, I naturally started collecting what I was familiar with (be it a publisher, artist, writer or just a particular style). I couldn't really say where I got them from, because it's been many, many years of collecting from a variety of sources. "
