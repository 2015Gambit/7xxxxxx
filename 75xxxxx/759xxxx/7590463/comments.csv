,madkillerabdo,2012-09-13T18:05Z,"""The procedure entry point GetThreadedLoadLibraryFunc could not be located in dynamic library tier0.dll"" and a message follows up by saying ""Failed to Load DLL Launcher: The Specified procedure could not be found"" 

This is the second torrent of L4D2 I download from Bruss and both had the EXACT same problem. Anything wrong with my installation? All I did is run the Setup, follow in-setup instruction, and then launch the game when done. 

Please Help :( 14GB downloaded twice IS a big deal :( "
