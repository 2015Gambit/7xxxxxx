*** 
I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
A companion piece to the Film Noir Classic Collection: Volume 3, this documentary examines the shady genre that brought us such classics as On Dangerous Ground and Border Incident. Coined by the French and literally meaning dark film, film noir has come to embody an essence all its own, a gloomy shadow world peopled with private eyes, femme fatales, losers, drifters and dames. The video also includes five bonus short films.
