um… no.
if you notice that film is listed under “Stuff I Want”, I have been looking for it for a while now."

The bonus films look like noir shorts . . . they were included in the disc.

Rounding out the bonus DVD are five shorts from the MGM film series ""Crime does not pay"":

""Women in hiding"" (1940) on unwed mothers;
""You, the people"" (1940) on a rigged election by a crime boss;
""Forbidden passage"" (1941) on illegal immigration;
""A gun in his hand"" (1945) on the murder of a policeman by a robber;
""The luckiest guy in the world"" (1947) on embezzlement."
,baybeh,2012-09-03T05:44Z,"Auge, can I request you to upload Straw Dogs, then? It would be lovely if you could."
,russell1nash,2012-09-03T12:53Z,"Auge, what's your email addy? Will try to hook you up :)"
