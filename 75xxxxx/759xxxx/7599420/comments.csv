,markofbear,2012-09-06T16:38Z,"For anyone that feels like downloading this, please and i cant stress this enough, turn it off in pvp, if youre going to invade people with inf. hp really destroys the game for people, if you like to go against a boss with a trainer, go ahead, but remeber for a lot of people pvp is the thing youll do after youve done everything else"
,otg21,2012-09-09T19:22Z,The trainer says game is not running. I have started it before and after starting game. Any idea whats wrong?
