This video is only 12 minutes long and its 430 Megs.
It is 1920x1080 so it should be in the hi-res category, not regular TV
And its not an XviD, its an H264 in an avi container
Mr.Uploader, you are supposed to show basic info when upload a video.
(The scene doesn't have to show info because they have standards.)
BTW: There is no sense uploading an avi if it isn't XviD.
But thanks for at least trying to share some content.

I found a better version here that I could play on my DVD player

Kind of drunk on Dr. Who all day.
Wasn't paying attention ...

It does say ""x264"" right in the title, tho'
The description shows why this is so.
Plenty of people seem to like it just fine.

Sorry you had to download it twice."
