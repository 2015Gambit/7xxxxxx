Workdone:
Video is the same as we released last time. Now for the line audio we had a few issue as it was missing 10min 43sec of the beginning and needed some major fixing and needed to be shrinked and sync to fit the R5 video which took us awhile. After that was done I would say it turned out pretty nice. I know its a bummer on the first 10mins but better then nothing. The Cam audio was cleaned up from the previous version we released, so its not to bad. ENJOY!
