Go to Hell! (1997) 

Based on the premise that "God" is actually an alien called G.D., who wiped out the dinosaurs and populated the Earth with apes from his own planet (who eventually evolve into us). "The Devil" is actually his son, "little Red", who disagrees with what he is doing and pops up throughout history trying to upset G.D.'s plans.
