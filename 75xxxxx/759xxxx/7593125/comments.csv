Otherwise, very nice releases."

[V],twentyforty,2012-09-03T07:10Z,"@8ax_: Nope, it is not, that is not the purpose of it. Sound is perfect and perfect things shouldn't be changed. And [quark], as my specific format (quark had mono sound) is dead from 2010.

@critic89: Thank you. So, you haven't seen SU forum list what was lost? Good news is that I re-uploaded pretty much everything what was gone. WC would be released."
