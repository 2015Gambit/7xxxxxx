Thanks a lot, man. Really appreciate your commitment. "
,wakeabake,2012-09-03T06:57Z,Just saw it on AMC and I'm impressed by the speed of your upload xCrazy. No spoilers here but it really sucks that we have to wait 10 fucking months to see the last 8 episodes! AMC ARE FUCKING GREEDY BASTARDS!
,mrtbngr,2012-09-03T07:14Z,"Thanks for the quick upload!!!

Please Seed!!"

,el_asesino,2012-09-03T07:30Z,hey man are you gonna have the walking dead season 3?
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-09-03T07:49Z,"Yes i will upload walking dead as soon as the season starts :)
"
,fieldof,2012-09-03T07:55Z,"""Proudly guaranteeing .Avi file torrents!""

Yet this is an MP4?  

Yes, I see your other post - I'll guess that one is an Avi."
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-09-03T08:17Z,"Ouch i been getting a lot of ""criticism"" lately..


I say i guarantee avi files because that is what i usually upload but for some TV shows like Breaking Bad i also upload MP4 versions because many people like it that way if YOU MUST know"
,fieldof,2012-09-03T08:59Z,"Easy there, dude.  I didn't mean it as a criticism.  I like MP4 files just fine.   ;-)"
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-09-03T09:06Z,ok :)

,OliverTwisted,2012-09-03T12:42Z,Is there an eco in here?
,Government10,2012-09-03T14:19Z,"10 months for next 8 episodes?  Thought they might have only made it 3-4, like they did with season 2 of the walking dead.  10 Months is fucking ridiculous. "
,sutil1,2012-09-03T14:22Z,"XCrazy your the man!! Thanks for your marvelous uploads..All ways on time..Really appreciated..

,ns2hplayer,2012-09-03T18:19Z,"much thanks xcrazy, quality, quickness, and consistency.  by the way government 10 if that wait is fucking ridiculous for you, then kill yourself, and it won't be a problem anymore.   "
,fieldof,2012-09-03T19:18Z,The degree to which you can't stand waiting for the series to resume is directly proportional to how great the series is.
,tverlaine,2012-09-03T22:24Z,"Thanks for giving me the chance to see this season's episodes in perfect quality.Looking forward to resuming in 10.I can wait,what's the alternative? Thanks again."
