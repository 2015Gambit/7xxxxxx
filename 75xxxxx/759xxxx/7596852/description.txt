It's Origins Are Secret.

It's Technology...21st Century.

It's Existence...Completely Disavowed.

...but it's presence; Undeniable.

Viper!


I feel I should go into some back story on this torrent.
1999 Sci Fi syndicated the Viper series as reruns shortly after it's Fourth and Final season wrapped up.  Every day at 7pm it aired until it cleared all episodes.
I was 15 at the time and recorded every single episode onto VHS.

About five years later I had gotten the urge to watch the series again.  However, while I did, I live-recorded them to DVD with a VHS/DVD Combo box.
Later I added a small menu system on each DVD.

Recently I ripped them all down to .avi and put them together in this torrent for all of you to enjoy.

The show is still not available on DVD, and I encourage all of you to get over to tvshowsondvd.com and vote for Viper.

That aside, due to this show being recorded to VHS over Coaxial and the tapes being about 6 years old stored in a dusty attic:
THE VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY IS TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRENDOUS.
I did what I could; and while most of the episodes are watchable, you may want to use VLC to clean up the image a bit and adjust the audio/video sync.

*Season 4 Episode 4 - Holy Matrimony - was too far gone to include in this torrent.
