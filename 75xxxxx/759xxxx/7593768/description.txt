Book Description

Ubuntu is a complete, free operating system that emphasizes ease of use, community, and support while enhancing speed, power, and flexibility. It is designed for everyone from computer novices to experts.

This title serves a wide audience: novices who just want to test the waters and give Ubuntu a try, intermediate users, and those who want to take the next step toward becoming power users. It is not intended as a guide to highly technical uses like professional systems administration or programming, although there is some technical material here; the focus is on learning the landscape.

New in this edition is deep coverage of the groundbreaking, user-experience-focused Unity desktop, an innovative new style of humanΓÇöcomputer interaction that has undergone extensive development and testing to provide powerful, industry-leading usability.
