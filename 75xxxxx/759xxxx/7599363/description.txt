In Brain Rules, Dr. John Medina, a molecular biologist, shares his lifelong interest in how the brain sciences might influence the way we teach our children and the way we work. In each chapter, he describes a brain ruleΓÇöwhat scientists know for sure about how our brains workΓÇöand then offers transformative ideas for our daily lives.
MedinaΓÇÖs fascinating stories and infectious sense of humor breathe life into brain science. YouΓÇÖll learn why Michael Jordan was no good at baseball. YouΓÇÖll peer over a surgeonΓÇÖs shoulder as he proves that most of us have a Jennifer Aniston neuron. YouΓÇÖll meet a boy who has an amazing memory for music but canΓÇÖt tie his own shoes.
You will discover how:
    * Every brain is wired differently
    * Exercise improves cognition
    * We are designed to never stop learning and exploring
    * Memories are volatile
    * Sleep is powerfully linked with the ability to learn
    * Vision trumps all of the other senses
    * Stress changes the way we learn
In the end, youΓÇÖll understand how your brain really worksΓÇöand how to get the most out of it.
