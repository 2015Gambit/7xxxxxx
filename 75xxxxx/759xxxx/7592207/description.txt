New Orleans Funk Vol.2~The Second Line Strut (Soul Jazz) [320KB] {MKOP}

An incredible follow up to the first New Orleans Funk compilation on Soul Jazz ΓÇô even harder-hitting than the first, and filled with funky rare gems! This set took nearly a decade to follow the first, but it's been well worth the wait ΓÇô and the crew at Soul Jazz have clearly used all that time to dig way past the obvious on the New Orleans scene, and come up with a really incredible batch of all-funky cuts all the way through! Even if you've got a dozen other New Orleans funk collections in your collection, you'll find plenty here to win you over ΓÇô as the package goes out of its way to pull cuts from rare singles and under-reissued material ΓÇô then wraps the whole thing up with the usual extra-thorough Soul Jazz approach to liner notes and details. And while some of the names are familiar here, they're nicely interspersed with lesser-known folks who keep things fresh ΓÇô making for a winning lineup that really sets a new standard for this sort of set.
