The Amazing Spider-Man is the story of Peter Parker (Garfield), an 
outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, 
leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field). 
Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how 
he got to be the person he is today. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand 
his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab 
of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man 
is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter 
will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny 
to become a hero

other things and then synced our fresh line to 
it all in all not bad at all apart from the slight
flicker in places enjoy till better arrives
