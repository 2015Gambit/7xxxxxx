,cinemania21,2012-09-04T14:32Z,"Hi Auge,
Thanks a lot for your uploads. I donÂ´t live in the USA and this is the only way to get movies I wonÂ´t find where I live. Do you have any of the following criterion or anchor bay dvds that you could upload: Flesh for Frankenstein, Blood for Dracula, the BRD Trilogy, Kind Hearts and Coronets, the Blood of a Poet, Testament of Orpheus, And God Created Woman, Mario Bava's Black Sunday or Black Sabbath? Well, anyway, thanks a lot for the movies you have uploaded already. Sorry to bother you."
