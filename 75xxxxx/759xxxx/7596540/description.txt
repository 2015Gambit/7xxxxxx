I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
Astrophysicist David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and wife Amy (Susan George) move to England to get away from the violence in America. But the Sumners learn that things are no better on the other side of the pond when local construction workers intimidate and exploit the couple. The trouble turns into a bloody battle when David -- who discovers a feral and vicious side of himself -- is forced to defend his home after Amy gets raped.
