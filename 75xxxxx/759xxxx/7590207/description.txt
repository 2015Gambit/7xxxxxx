Straight from Rivington Street in the lower east side of New York City, The Dirty Pearls tell their stories about sex, drugs and rock n' roll. They deliver rock anthems that make you roll down your car window, turn the stereo all the way up and just drive!

They've supported KISS, Bret Michaels, Scott Weiland, Jet, New York Dolls and Andrew WK (to name a few) and perform regularly up and down the east/west coast. Their high-energy live shows make your heart pound, feet stop and if you don't leave singing a 'Pearls song, then you were never there at all. Real rock nΓÇÖ roll has returned, now wipe that smile off your face!
