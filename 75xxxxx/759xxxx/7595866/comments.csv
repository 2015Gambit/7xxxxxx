,javierwan,2012-09-03T23:09Z,what version is it.. DVDRip? BRRip? HDTV?
,mf-den,2012-09-04T10:06Z,"@javierwan: I have mentioned it everywhere on this page, but here I go again "" This is a 720p Web-Dl rip"". Web-Dl has the same length as that of a 720p HDTV but significantly improved a/v quality and also has the ending credits. So the quality is somewhere between that of a 720p HDTV rip and a BrRip. Hope u got it"
,croise,2012-09-04T21:12Z,"@mf-den - thank you!  That's what I've been looking for. Small size and fine quality.

@people - seed! :)"
,nexusCFX,2012-09-04T21:15Z,I'd seed the fuck out of this if I could even get it. When someone wants to unfuck it and seed enough for me to download it I'll seed 112GB.
,croise,2012-09-05T21:13Z,very slow.... Damn! Seed! 
,llah,2012-09-06T01:58Z,"Chill guys, its a damn new torrent. I'm getting reasonable seeds, and once its done, ill see this for a good long while."
,llah,2012-09-06T08:18Z,"Actually no, it seems that everyone only seems to have about 52% of this torrent, and we can only share that much, TPB is showing between 4-6 seeders at any one time, if we can just get a few more complete downloads, this can work."
,mf-den,2012-09-06T15:17Z,@EVERYONE: Its currently showing me 111 seeders and 530 leechers in my torrent client which means ppl are seeding but its not reflected. So pls be patient with this torrent. I'm seeding my max speed out here.
,croise,2012-09-06T22:24Z,"ok, I've finally downloaded the first episode...!!! 
A/V looks like = 10/10

cheers"
,willcollbert,2012-09-08T16:05Z,Awesome dude! I've finished the whole torrent in 1hour! Thanks!
,Danko8321,2012-09-13T03:21Z,"Great Release! Thank you very much.

PD: It can actually be a bit weaker in quality than the rips, but mostly it is above them; also, it is 720p in 300MB, what more can you ask for?"
,ani12,2012-09-15T04:05Z,guys rate the torrents :) pls :) thank u :)
