Always the same pattern!

Win XP -> Winshit -> Win 7 ->Winshit"

,murphy78,2012-09-05T06:42Z,"I do not have a lot of experience with 64 bit integration.  Most of the tools are different.  Some directories are different.  I'll see what I can do.  I cannot promise anything for 64bit until I get a little more experience, but I'll work on it; as far as I know, the method used would work just fine as long as I obtained all the appropriate 64 bit files.

Anyway, here's to hope :)"
,Kick4U,2012-09-05T08:43Z,"It needs to also be done on a 64- bit computer and DVD.  I am still using this install on my HTPC tho!

Sweet job"
,omgmusti,2012-09-05T08:57Z,"Hi, i just had to say that people like you make the internet as awesome as it is. Thanks so much for putting the effort into this. I'm reinstalling windows on a friends laptop (it's quite old, only 2GB RAM. But it has a HDMI port so go figure) but I'll keep a look out for your future releases. Thanks again"
,murphy78,2012-09-05T12:38Z,"OK folks, I put in the effort and it was relatively painless.  The 64 bit version is at:
