A great album from a great musician. Released in 1975 it is full of experiment from a Bob Dylan who was still trying to find his own sound in the world of electric rock music. Full of great lyrics, wonderful guitar work, and an all around feeling of FUCK YES this album is a must have for the avid Dylan fan. Or just anyone who likes to listen to a cohesive album with great transition and a chill vibe. Enjoy!
