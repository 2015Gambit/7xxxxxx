,netgrazer,2012-09-02T22:08Z,"SWAXXON I appreciate the upload n all but what's with the RARs?

It's just such a demented way of torrenting. Can't play & seed at the same time, every downloader needs to unpack instead of just you, and there are no (NONE!) pros to RARring torrents, just cons.

No gain in terms of file size or error correction (which is built in with torrents). Scene release verification? BS, anyone can make a multivolume RAR out of anything, and nobody gives a damn.

I'm going for the unrarred version, which is here:

You actually beat scene4all by half an hour, and their torrent has already overtaken yours by a thousand leechers. You could have unRARred the whole thing and still be the first to up this baby. FYI."
