"...the most authoritative and trusted source of pharmacological information, has now spawned a portable pocket drug guide....This manual extracts the essential core drug information from the eleventh edition of the parent book, referring the reader to the online version of the parent book for historical aspects, many chemical and clinical details, and additional figures and references. This makes G & G a very useful book. This will be of use to individuals in training or practice in the fields of pharmacy, medicine, nursing, or allied health disciplines where knowledge of drug actions are important....Each chapter provides the core essential information provided in the parent book in a very readable format. Readers can use this easy to handle and read manual for essential information along with the online version of the parent book as a reference for more in-depth specific information on drugs."--Doody's Review Service
