,Mahdi96,2012-09-04T13:44Z,do I need the original game or do I just launch this ?
,h3ro,2012-09-04T15:13Z,U need to download the walking dead episode1 and 2 and after that download this...
,evilkat2010,2012-09-04T20:46Z,ei h3ro can you help me? I just finished playing this episode and when I try to rewind it instead of the chapter's name and thumbnail there's just a picture of Lilly in every square and when I click any of them I end up in the beginning of episode 2. Can you help me fix this? 
,Eshu,2012-09-06T09:50Z,"Works great for me, but I seem to be having trouble with the end. The part where you need to (quickly) pick up the wrench at the door seems to just make me look at the wrench instead of use it. Anyone have a suggestion on how to pick it up? I've tried everything and I'm starting to think its actually a bug...weird."
,g4laxy,2012-09-11T02:31Z,I'm having the same problem as evilkat2010.  Is there any way to fix this?
,g4laxy,2012-09-14T19:24Z,"All right, so I'm having some trouble with this. I was playing through ep 2 and quit out of the game. When I came back to it later, the game had some trouble loading, so I restarted my computer and the game loaded fine, but my save was gone. It doesn't even recognize that I've played the game at all, it's like I opened it for the very first time. How can I get my saves back so I can continue with the game?"
