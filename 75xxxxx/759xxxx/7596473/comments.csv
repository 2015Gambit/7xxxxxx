,pow.r.pop,2012-09-04T07:44Z,"Dude ! 
Howard is a fucking cocksucker . 
Another week off ?!!!?!
And he never even lets people know.
I wouldn't mind if he at least told people whats up.
And I don't even pay ! ! !
Imagine how pissed off you would be if you were looking forward to it AND YOU WERE PAYING FOR IT ! 

Fuck him. Retire already. "

,Fitzy727,2012-09-04T13:07Z,"LOL...  Pretty sure you can find howards schedule on his website...  And LOL @ getting mad over it even though you don't pay for Sirius!

AGT is a terrible show even though my man Howard is on it.  Sharon Osborne is a cunt and nick cannon should tell the world he has a vagina already LOOOOL"

[V],wushdishmeen,2012-09-05T08:45Z,"@pow.r.pop - The angriest guy ever?  It's just a radio show... not a political stance.

WDM Network has vacation schedule and also the Sirius website page for H100 lists the schedule so you know what's coming up 7 days in advanced.

Howard himself rarely mentions it so people will still tune in expecting a live show and hopefully get sucked in to the special instead.  Rather than people knowing he's on vacation and not tuning in at all.

That's my only guess for his logic... but if you truly wanted to know the information is out there and easy to find."
