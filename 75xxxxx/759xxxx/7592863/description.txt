Hello it's "me" again, this time for yet another countless update to show how easy it truly is to install Doom 3 and its Expansion Resurrection of Evil!

I have updated my old torrent but for various reasons I cannot delete the old one so if this one works better for you consider the old nuked!

0.)
Prepare your PC by disable Anti-Virus and terminate Internet connection.
Also copy and paste this information for easy reference during install process.

1.)
Mount the downloaded file:
DOOM3_ULTIMATE.iso with Daemon Tools, or whatever you use.

2.)
If you have two slots for mount:
then also mount the Doom 3 Expansion ISO found in "Extras / Resurrection of Evil".
(Some prefer to copy it outside of Doom 3 ISO and then mount it).

3.)
Install Doom 3 first and save the Expansion for last, during install choose and insert serial:
4C2Q-3J34-U5KH-UBCT-58
XPZB-S6E4-E2CW-5QF5-64
3LBA-NB6Y-VZT5-EAL4-48
YRFE-W324-WDKK-P32H-B8
LHW9-UTV7-SKL3-EAUQ-FB
G4ST-PPPF-W7H2-E6GY-2C
DCLR-BQP7-J3R7-SVHV-2E
CAYR-T4QF-UZPR-DG4W-AD
9SXK-55AL-D6DE-AAWP-C2
X3N7-6WBC-4WQ3-8NVL-61
YRDE-SBQB-QMS3-UXD9-D1

After Doom 3 completes, don't register the game or install DirectX- just finish and quit!

4.)
Start install for the Expansion "Resurrection of Evil" which we mounted earlier.
Follow the same process as before and insert serial:
PSBC-TASC-33WB-PH7L-C0
T7LB-BD27-TWLC-SDGD-F6

It will need to patch the original Doom 3 before install continues, follow the procedure it presents.
After you're done, don't install DirectX- just finish and quit!

5.)
Also install included patch v1.3 (this is just 1.3(0), nothing more nothing less).
Find it in the folder "Extras / Doom 3 - Update / Doom 3 v1_3.exe".

6.)
Finally I also applied the included CRACK... Yes, I did!
It's located in "Extras / Doom 3 - Key & Crack / DOOM3.exe".
Use it by overwriting the original found in your install destination folder, do a backup first if you want.

DONE!)
Now play the awesome game and stop complain! :D
