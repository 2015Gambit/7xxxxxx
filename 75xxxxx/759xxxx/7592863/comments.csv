So I apologize if the current seeding speed is low for you people, this torrent is kind of new.

Thanks for your patience until we have plenty enough seeders! :)"

You are like those silly religious people who scream down the street ""omg, the end is near and judgement day is upon us!!""

I recommend you to use anti-virus that is free and one of the best out there:
""microsoft security essentials""

This torrent doesn't contain any viruses or trojans at all because it's not first time in history that anti-viruses ever liked those keygens.

Reason is that ""keygens"" are never liked by any legal company and considered a threat ;)

This torrent has been confirm many times to work before, want some source then read the main description to my old link."
