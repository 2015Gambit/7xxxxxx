,xboxmodman7369,2012-09-04T22:34Z,"This is a movie for all the Republican and Democrat voters to see! We all(Notice I said ALL)need to take a stand for our country and it's beliefs! No matter what side your on, we must all do what is right for this country! 16 Trillion dollars in debt by our current president? Come on people lets Rise Up and Fight to end this crisis America is facing by electing an AMERICAN president this time. If you happen to watch this in a Obama supported town and they start to chant ""Obama"" throughout the movie just tell the manager you want your money back! Then try watching it with people who are not ignorant and really care about our country. If you still think Obama is a ""good guy"" after watching this movie you fall into the ignorant group I spoke of before:) 

""GOD BLESS AMERICA""

PLEASE upload this movie so I can pass it to everyone I know who can't go and see it!"
,CSTUTES,2012-09-05T04:29Z,"I've heard a lot of positive reviews from both Conservative and Moderates. One thing that everyone that has seen it  agrees on, is that you come away knowing your President and his views a lot better. And contrary to what Pro Obama folks might be saying, it is not an Anti-Obama  documentary, it is the true background into why President Obama thinks as he does.... And Yes, God Bless America!  "
,basama,2012-09-05T22:18Z,Plz upload the movie. 
,KingDiamondMine,2012-09-06T19:48Z,If anyone has the full-length movie.  Please upload and seed!  EVERYONE needs to see it.
,xboxmodman7369,2012-09-07T00:24Z,"The things in this video are a little too far out there, and allot of it is made up. But the fact is that this country is in worse shape than when Obama took office, and if he gets another 4 years we probably will be more like a socialist country than a democracy! You can not, with an honest and humble heart say that Obama has been a good president, and that he deserves another term. If you do, your a hardcore leftwing radical who has been raised to think that conservatives are evil, and you just can't accept the fact that your candidate has failed and is NOT the man for the job! Community organizer! Yeah right. If he had brain one he would open up the oil pipeline. That would create enough jobs, and lower gas prices enough that he would definately win again. Thank God he's not smart enough to do that. Now, all the hardcore radical liberals can go ahead and start flaming me and giving me numbers and stories, that you have NO proof of, to let me know how misguided I am! Show me the ""right"" way! "
,krdonnell,2012-09-10T20:45Z,"WOW, maybe Americans are stupid. Especially if you believe in this. Don't read the FOX news reviews, I'm sure they love it. And by the way hes done a lot, ((Please Read This) http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/what-has-obama-done-since-january-20-2009.html) were are better off than 4 years ago, Freddie Mac, Fanny May Ring a bell??? Sept 7 2008 *cough* Bush era *cough*, we bailed them out. Go look at a graph, at the end of Bush everything went wrong, then Obama took office and slowed down the implosion. And now things are slowly coming back to normal. He cant wave a magic wand and make everything OK like your mother kissing you boo boo. If he could he would of. Doesn't help that the GOP fought him every step of the way. Sarah Palin screaming ""lets make him a one-term president"" ring any bells. And BTW its impossible for any president to do the dramatic socialist change you talk about. Its called checks and balances, read a history book once in while, and give credit to our founding fathers to write a almost perfect Constitution that allows for change in a forever changing world.

,otbros,2012-09-11T04:53Z,"There seems to be a complete blackout of ""2016 Ob*ma's America"" - the movie!  On other torrent sites, there are 20 or 30 of them and they're ALL FAKE!!

It seems as if someone does not want us to watch this movie.  I've never seen any kind of censorship on a torrent like this before!"
,oneslider,2012-09-11T05:02Z,"Jeeezus Kole97, you really are a dumb arse.
I thought you'd all died out.
"
,Calvin1334,2012-09-11T08:44Z,"Look how dumb americans are people!!! lol A film done by a man who knows and studies politics, backed by facts that is hidden from mainstream media, and all of a sudden it's the dumb Jersey Shore, sports watching morons who decide it's not true! lol Seriously most americans are so ignorant to politics they can't even name the full administration of the candidate they support!!!!! Yet all these dumb idiots deny out of egotism insteadďťż of realizing we are in trouble.

thanks Kole97"
