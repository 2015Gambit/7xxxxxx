Curious about Ubuntu, but not sure where to start? Start here: ΓÇ£Ubuntu: An Absolute BeginnerΓÇÖs GuideΓÇ¥, by author Courtney Loo, is the latest free guide from MakeUseOf and will teach you everything you need to know about Ubuntu in easy-to-understand language.

Ubuntu is a free/libre, open-source computer operating system with 20 million users worldwide. But itΓÇÖs also so much more than that: it is an ethos, a collaborative project and, first and foremost, Ubuntu is a community of people.

If youΓÇÖre reading this guide, youΓÇÖre probably interested in moving away from proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X; perhaps youΓÇÖve already installed Ubuntu on your computer but are not sure where to start.

Migrating to a new operating system can be daunting, especially when faced with unfamiliar words like ΓÇÿFLOSSΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿcommand line interfaceΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿkernelΓÇÖ. Many people are intimidated by the technical jargon of a non-commercial operating system and believe itΓÇÖs too advanced for them.

Well, that is simply not true.

Ubuntu is easy to install and simple to use. Best of all: itΓÇÖs completely FREE!
