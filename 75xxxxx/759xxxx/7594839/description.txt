NBC Primetime Preview Show (2012)

A sneak peak of new and returning shows on NBC's prime-time lineup for the 2012-2013 season. Hosted by a very lame Matthew Perry.

Shows briefly featured:
- The Voice
- Go On
- Revolution
- The New Normal
- Animal Practice
- Guys with Kids
- Chicago Fire
- Grimm

This aired on NBC HD in Canada. This was recorded using analog, and the video quality is poorer than normal. So overall something like V6, A8: watchable but not great.
