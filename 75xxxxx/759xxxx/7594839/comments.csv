It's suppose to be re-aired either this week or next but you have to check your local listings.  I'd like to try and catch an HD version but I already have an SD version from TV.

I caught FOX today but on SD. However, it appears they compressed the WS to fit SD. If nobody uploads a copy I might use that one.

I tried ABC's but the signal fell out, however there's a couple other copies here already. CBS is the only one I don't have so far in some form.

And I'm reseeding my upload of last year's 2011 shows at the moment.
