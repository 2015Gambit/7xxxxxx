As Pakistan and India celebrated their Independence Day with glittering fanfare on 14th and 15th August, respectively, all public  squares, bazaars and streets in Indian-administered Kashmir were  deserted. A curfew was imposed by the Indian Army, unsuccessfully  as it turned out, public protests by millions of Kashmiris swelling the  valleyΓÇÿs streets calling for an end to Indian rule. In less than a week,  Indian forces killed more than thirty unarmed civilians including a  prominent political leader  ΓÇô  Sheikh Abdul Aziz. The public protest  started as the Indian government transferred 40 hectares of land to a Hindu trust that manages a local shrine, Amarnath, amid fears that  India is trying to bring about slow demographic change as the number of Muslim population has dwindled significantly over the last six dec-ades. What started as a public protest against a small land issue soon  turned into massive civil disobedience movement and demands of  freedom from India. However, once again the political dispute was  transformed into a communal confrontation as thousands of Hindu  militant extremists supported by the government joined the violent  anti-Kashmiri protests who were labelled under categories like Islamic terroristsΓÇÿ,separatistsΓÇÿ and of course communalΓÇÿ, once again putting the religion at the heart of a struggle that is mainly political.
