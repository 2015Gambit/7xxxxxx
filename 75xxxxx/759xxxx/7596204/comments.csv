I recommend Dawkins, Hitchens and Harris to immunize you against this rubbish."

You should change your name to BOZOfan since you're a fan of the three biggest non-thinkers and bozos of them all. I don't know where you get your definition from, but you need to spend more time reading if this is what you believe. Actually, your definition of faith fits perfectly well with your evolution religion. You believe something that is a proven fairytale for dummies, non-thinkers, and science haters. Science by definition means knowledge derived through the sense, through observation and experimentation. Which part of this fits with evolution? You can’t observe it and you can’t test it. You can only believe it. There is not one shred of evidence to support it, so that is not even faith, that’s a delusion and simply fiction.

Now, let me correct you on your definition of Biblical faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Notice you have evidence, but not the end product itself. We have evidence, not proof for what we believe. If you don’t know the difference between evidence and proof, again, read more books of value instead of listening to the three stooges you mentioned. Here is an example of the faith and logic of a Christian compared with an evolutionist/atheist: If a Christian just arrived on a deserted island and saw what appeared to be human footprints on the beach, he would logically conclude that the island was not deserted and that there was at least one human on it. On the other hand, an evolutionist/atheist would conclude that the footprints were either caused by erosion or that there was an animal with human feet that caused the footprints. Check out the incoherent, illogical arguments, and lack of scientific reasoning offered by evolutionist and see if I am wrong.

Now, try Hitchens, Harris, and DUH-kins? DUH-kins is perhaps the dullest so-called scientist on planet Earth. He should have his PhD revoked or recalled. He knows nothing at all about Biology. He simply makes up stuff and no one argues with him since he is defending his religion.

Get on the side of true science, logic, and reasoning and leave your evolution religion of nonsense alone. Evolutionists and atheists don't believe in Science, so get with it!"

i really have no desire to argue on tpb but i just wanted to say that you must legally retarded. 

just so you know the process of evolution (speciation specifically) has been observed in the wild.  just because you dont understand evolution and know nothing about it doenst mean it isnt true.  youre right there is not one shred of evidence to support it, there is actually a mountain of evidence supporting it that you deny exists."
