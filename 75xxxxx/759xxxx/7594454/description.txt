The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On this Sunday, September 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with leading trends forecaster Gerald Celente about the still unfolding economic collapse and the social unrest designed to accompany it. 

In a health blitz, Aaron Dykes and Alex discuss the benefits of weight loss, energy and vitality available through Youngevity and other vitamin supplements. 

Martial law researcher Doug Hagmann unveils warnings from his insider sources that the Obama administration is preparing to go "hot" with a false flag event, possibly timed for an October Surprise. 

Finally, Congressman Walter Jones talks about his resolution HR 5925 to safeguard Americans against unwarranted drone surveillance, while also highlighting high levels of troop deaths in Afghanistan, even as public attention shifts away from the long war.
