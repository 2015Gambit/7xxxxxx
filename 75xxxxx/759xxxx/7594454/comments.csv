,Phat-Tony,2012-09-04T07:28Z,this torrent is damaged it only gets to within a few kb of complete but I downloaded the file zipped from sebaygo1 blog site and unzipped it and rechecked it in utorrent and the same thing happened so all you stuck at 98% have actually got 100% some of you may need to remove ut from the last file name.
