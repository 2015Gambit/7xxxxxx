,loledujo,2012-09-01T21:23Z,"he is vip so yep, most likely."
,MoRaja,2012-09-01T21:23Z,"This looks legit based on the 5 second preview my VLC is giving me.  V10 A10. But again, based on 5 second preview. "
,cs4life,2012-09-01T21:24Z,@hank: ofc!

,slaboteur,2012-09-01T21:31Z,"Good old DibyaTPB! Thanks, very much appreciate this. :D"
,chipset31,2012-09-01T21:33Z,It's legit
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:33Z,"Hey DibyaTPB, can you upload a version that is around 350-450 MB in avi format encoded with divx/xvid? MP3 audio around 128-256kbps too. That's usually how the episodes are done on here. I wonder if MadMartha or Albiondean are still alive. Where are you guys? Lol.."
,sallyts,2012-09-01T21:34Z,"yes, it's legit, watching right now"
,jessyang,2012-09-01T21:37Z,Please seed! My torrent has 300 seeders and 1000+ in swarm and only ONE person is connected?!
,chris[mufc]150,2012-09-01T21:38Z,"DibyaTPB never dissapointed me so yeah, it's legit."
,JA266194,2012-09-01T21:40Z,FAKE dont even try There's a reason it has so many leeches
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:44Z,I also noticed you upload a lot of other tv shows. I'd like to suggest all episodes of The Eric Andre Show. That show is fucking hilarious! 
,zombiekat,2012-09-01T21:45Z,THANK YOU!!!
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:46Z,"JA226 I think you're fake. I'd download it but I'm waiting on the avi encoded in divx. I know x264 is better quality in a smaller size, but I prefer divx because it is more versatile. I don't want to have to rely on a computer to watch this, with divx it plays in most dvd players. :P"

,eklypsedmind,2012-09-01T21:48Z,What is the password?
,Mustnot,2012-09-01T21:50Z,"yes, it's legit."
,MoRaja,2012-09-01T21:50Z,Ok this is legit. About 20 mins till I can seed. 
,OnlineOni,2012-09-01T21:50Z,"Well, at least it's not a RAR."
,TARDISblue,2012-09-01T21:51Z,Any good?
,eklypsedmind,2012-09-01T21:52Z,Nevermind. Maybe I'm losing it but I swore the torrent I downloaded was from this thread. It's 550MB and asked for a PW. I'm re-downloading now. 
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:55Z,eklypsedmind: Are we playing porno password? Wtf are you talking about? lol
,BradleyHatch,2012-09-01T21:57Z,"Great! Will seed this one when I get it for a while, so excited! Thanks all."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T21:58Z,The password is... TAINT!
,hasteur,2012-09-01T22:01Z,"The Torrentz must flow!.  Seriously, open your upstream people.  Sooner everyone gets their copy more seeds we get."
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T22:07Z,Albiondean where are you?!?! 
,clint-barton,2012-09-01T22:11Z,"This is shit. 
To have the password you have to give your number to a website with a download.

Damn you "
,Windoze321,2012-09-01T22:17Z,Totally legit.  The reason why it has so many leechers is because it's a GREAT show... 
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T22:27Z,"Where are these people getting this password crap from? I'm downloading this anyways, but if I must I'll convert the file to avi/divx if nobody else does. I prefer to have a copy burned to disc that can be played in any dvd player as I have friends with compatible dvd players and no HDMI for laptops/desktops. Just wish this was already in DIVX not x264! Fuck x264 in the butt with a Dalek plunger!"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T22:39Z,"It's the best show of all time! But enough of this x264 crap! I don't want to have to rely on a computer to watch Doctor Who. I like doing it the old fashioned way and being able to watch it on my dvd player and tv, where I can fit half the season on a DVD in avi/divx format. 

UPLOAD A VERSION OF THIS FILE ENCODED WITH DIVX! File size should be around 350-430MB with the audio at 128kbps. I'm downloading both though. I just have a lot of friends that don't have the technology to watch x264 encoded files!

If I must I'll convert the file myself, but divx is pretty much standard. I don't see why nobody has uploaded any copies in divx like usual. :("
,erraticchevy,2012-09-01T22:41Z,"DOESNT HAVE/PLAY SOUND.
ALSO WONT WORK ON PS3"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T22:48Z,@ErraticCherry: That's because it's x264 and not DIVX! Read my previous comments! Just wait there should be a proper avi encoded in DIVX coming out soon and not this x264 bullshit. 
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T22:49Z,"Sorry, erraticchevy.. lol"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T23:00Z,"Over here for the traditional Xvid encoded upload that will play on most dvd players and ps3! Great job Dibya!

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7590950/Doctor.Who.2005.7x01.HDTV.XviD-FS_[PublicHD]"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-09-01T23:08Z,"Divx/Xvid are pretty much the same encoder. Download the Xvid encoded file chevy, that will work for your ps3."
,MOUTH_SEX,2012-09-02T00:13Z,"XviD & DIVX have pretty much the same decoder, & almost every program or bit of hardware that can decode one can also do the other, but the encoders are significantly more different. H.264 has taken the limelight since x264 really got good, but back when Apple & Nero had the best H.264 encoders, XviD was king of the pile. Its encoder can just shove a whole lot more quality into a given filesize than DIVX's can. Go XviD if you can."
,MOUTH_SEX,2012-09-02T00:18Z,"Also, WTF do you live in a Mexican slum or something? Buy a fucking cable & hook your comp up to your TV. DVD players are like VCRs or gramophones or some old dude who blows in with the night & regales you with tales of olde, asking nothing but to sit by the fire & sleep in your barn. Sheesh."
,totonana,2012-09-02T03:51Z,"Guys, a torrent of the episode that came out before, it was 550 MB and named almost like this one, but it was fake (rar + passwd), and it got out around 30 minutes before the episode was aired (so, obvious fake)

Anyway, it got deleted, and this one is the real deal. Good video/audio."
,piratebuddha,2012-09-02T05:53Z,"This torrent is legit. 10/10 for audio/video. I have already watched it on my HDTV and my Android phone. The few people who keep complaining need to familiarize yourselves with VLC player and get a laptop which connects to your TV with a simple HDMI wire. It's 2012 kids, catch up already."
,islandinthesun,2012-09-02T10:23Z,very nice but next time get all the end credits ?
