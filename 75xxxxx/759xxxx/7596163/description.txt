Emperor was a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1991, regarded as highly influential by critics and emerging black metal bands.[1][2][3] They dissolved in 2001, but reunited in 2006 and again in 2007 for a few festival dates and brief US tours. The group was founded by Samoth (drums) and Ihsahn (guitar/vocals).
