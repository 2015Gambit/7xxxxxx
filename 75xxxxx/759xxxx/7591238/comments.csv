,5-click,2012-09-04T03:15Z,"@steevo: This was a little bit 'easier', i had only to remove the bikini. It took only six hours. =) 
""Sandra VI - in my town"" was harder and took ~18 hours. I had to turn the light from front to back. Yes it can. All a matter of illusion. Draw a corona around the Object and paint the edges brighter, it would seem as the light came from behind."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-09-05T12:39Z,"Thanks for reply 5-c , ( only 6 hours ) phew , I would give up after half an hour , I defo wouldnt have the patience . So well done for all your time and effort mate . "
