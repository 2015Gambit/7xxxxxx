Notes: The first letters of the songs of this show spelled out "Fuck Your Face" before Fuck Your Face itself was played. Before You Enjoy Myself, Page said, "We're so happy to be here, we love this place, we really do...We love Dick's". Trey and the band then led the crowd in a "We Love Dick's" chant. During the You Enjoy Myself vocal jam, "We Love Dick's" theme emerged with such lines as, "Page loves Dick's, Mike loves Dick's, Trey loves Dick's, the band loves Dick's". Ocelot included a Crosseyed and Painless tease. Prior to the second set, Trey wished Matty from the Waterwheel table a Happy Birthday. Runaway Jim and Chalk Dust were unfinished. Emotional Rescue was played for the first time since September 30, 2000 (236 shows). Fuck Your Face contained an Emotional Rescue quote.
