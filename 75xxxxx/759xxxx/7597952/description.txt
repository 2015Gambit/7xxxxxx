Discovering the Life Span  provides students with a strong balance of research and applications.
 
Many instructors would like to cover the entire life span in a single term and help their students see the big picture. They want students to understand how the domains of development work together and perhaps, most importantly, have their students truly connect to the material. This remarkable text does all of this. Its balanced modular format treats each stage of life and each domain equally throughout the text. With 10 chapters, 3 modules per chapter, and only 576 pages, Discovering the Life Span is more manageable for instructors and students. It allows instructors to cover all areas of the life span without having to sacrifice content during their one-term course and students get a better sense of the entire process of development. Interactive resources like MyDevelopmentLab and MyVirtualChild produce a meaningful learning experience and prepare students to apply content to their personal and future professional lives.
