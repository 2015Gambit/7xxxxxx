This time Max and Stacy discuss what happens when ersatz money heroin stops working and Treasury bonds are sold by hucksters and everything is guaranteed by the state. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to John Rubino of DollarCollapse.com about fiat currencies, how they collapse and how fast it happens.
