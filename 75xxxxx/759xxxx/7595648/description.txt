CUETools 2.1.4 (Full Install Pack 32bit) - 2010kaiser





INFO:

CUETools x86 (32bit):

CUETools is a tool for lossless audio/CUE sheet format conversion. The goal is to make sure the album image is preserved accurately. A lossless disc image must be lossless not only in preserving contents of the audio tracks, but also in preserving gaps and CUE sheet contents. Many applications lose vital information upon conversion, and don't support all possible CUE sheet styles. For example, foobar2000 loses disc pre-gap information when converting an album image, and doesn't support gaps appended (noncompliant) CUE sheets. 

Install Instructions:

1. Install .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 included in the torrent.
2. Visual C++ 2008 runtime included in the torrent.
3. Open the CUETools 2.1.4 folder and run the CUETools .exe
