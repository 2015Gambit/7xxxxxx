,actorman46,2012-08-09T00:45Z,It looks like a good one. Just thought I'd let everyone know since we got a lot of fakes yesterday. Thank you so much! It got spoiled for me last week since it took so long for others to put up. I love you!

,izzybel,2012-08-12T01:19Z,Thank you rubylove :-)
,Dakota85,2012-08-15T11:09Z,"Thanks again Rubylove (My prev thank you comment didn't appear on here strangely lol I must have hit the wrong button) - lets hope we don't have to struggle to see the final one =D so excited. I agree though Ruby - some of us have paid donations to websites to upload these shows and they randomly pick and choose when and if they cover them without ever saying anything :( makes what you do all the more important, thank you so much rubylove!"
,jaybeebrad,2012-08-15T13:04Z,RubyRubyRuby! :D I am counting on you to upload the finale! XOXOXOXO
,Dakota85,2012-08-15T14:29Z,"Me too Jaybee *fingers crossed* its 10.30pm here in Oz on Wed night and all the other shows loaded around 10.5 hours ago (Not aimed at rubylove but the other uploaders) so here's hoping it comes soon - having trouble avoiding spoilers, doing well so far lol!"
,BeautifulFreak,2012-08-15T18:25Z,"Awesome file..but..
Y no season finally up yet?:("
,jaybeebrad,2012-08-15T20:11Z,"I as well Dakota! Every time I load Facebook I hold my hand up to make sure no spoilers appear! Of course RubyLove owes us nothing at all, but s/he has been my hero for weeks now and I am DYING to find out the results! Hopefully the live aftershow video will also be posted!"
,MissKnoxie,2012-08-15T21:09Z,"Love your work, rubylove. Lights up my day! ;) Waiting in exhitement for the final..."
,Dakota85,2012-08-16T04:00Z,"14 hours after my last post and still nobody has the final :( not aiming this at rubylove, just disappointed as its not like Glee Project is a small random show. Its so frustrating to see shows like Flowerpot men and gold diggers or whatever get uploaded straight away but this show completely gets forgotten lol. *fingers crossed* that its here soon =D"
