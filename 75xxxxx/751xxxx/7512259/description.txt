Long description:

I have spent about two weeks gathering mods for this game, spent many days of playing, many more days of uninstalling unwanted mods, uninstalling mods that don't work very well. I've been going back and forth until I had the game just perfect for my taste. I've fine tuned all the mods, the install order and everything.

If you are looking to play this game and have great fun, this torrent might be for you. I have personally made a mod that will give you the best u-boat, equipments, upgrades, weapons, torpedo's and emblems from the very beginning of the campaign. So you can play through the game using the best u-boat from the start.

Among the 41 mods that comes with this game, I can mention a few of them. intro screen logo removed, accurate german flags, dynamic environment, low color exterior, better terrain, better fog, better waves, better underwater green atlantic effect, smaller trees, see through wake fix, deck spray, new crew uniforms, more and better crew commands, speech fixes, New user interface with silent hunter 5 original style kept intact, mano scope, Irai artificial intelligence, hydrophone fix, CO2 fix and many other unofficial fixes, corrected depth charge projector, improved hull wetness look, new audio mod, new sound for deck cannon with empty shells too, realistic ammo amount for guns, new diesel engine sounds, new large map tools for accurate map operations etc. etc. etc.

Mods have been carefully selected to avoid memory resource hogs, even though I have a fast computer, I have avoided just that.

Extract using 7zip.

Please seed as long as you can, this torrent was hard to do.
