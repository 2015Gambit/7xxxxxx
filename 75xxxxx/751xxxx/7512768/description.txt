The Zoo: Series 2
This nicely observed series brings us the highs and lows of the zoo staff and their attempts to breed their creatures. Reptile keeper Ian does incredibly noble work with frogs on the edge of extinction called mountain chickens. He holds one up. "Look at those eyes, Beautiful, beautiful eyes," he says dreamily. Working so closely with animals every day means all the keepers at London Zoo and its countryside counterpart, Whipsnade, are besotted with their charges: Alex even admits that her gang of sea lions are her best friends. When you see the bond she has with them, you'll understand. Sarah Lancashire narrates.


1)  Part 1 
The first in a two-part follow-up to the 2010 series charting life at London Zoo in Regent's Park, beginning as the keepers play matchmaker to their animals. Head bird keeper Adrian is under pressure to deliver a healthy number of chicks at the zoo's newest exhibit, Penguin Beach, while head reptile keeper Ian tries to raise awareness of a devastating plague affecting frogs and save one particular species from extinction.
