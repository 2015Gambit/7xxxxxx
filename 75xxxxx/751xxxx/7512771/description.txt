In this ZBrush tutorial, we will talk about some of the painting, rendering, and fiber workflows in ZBrush. This tutorial was designed to evolve your workflows, and give you some concepts to keep in mind as you paint and render your creatures in ZBrush. The objectives for this fast-pace tutorial include looking at several updated workflows and techniques for quickly painting your models and adding hair, fur, and feathers. We won’t be going step by step, but rather talk in broader terms about some of the tools and methods you can use and what options you have for dealing with some of the issues that may arise. It is recommended you have experience using ZBrush as we cover a lot of information in a shorter span of time.
