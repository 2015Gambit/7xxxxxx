For the last 40 years, Syria has been ruled by a tyrannical, unelected family, the Assads. They have stolen, jailed, tortured, abused and killed the people in their own country to maintain power. March 15, 2011 marked the first day of the current protests against the illegitimate country.  Peaceful protests that were met with force, bullets, shells and death.

This torrent is just a small sampling of the songs sang during the protests. The songs are included in both video and mp3 format, you don't need to download both folders if you don't need both. Hopefully this is the first of many releases like this.

Please remember the brave citizens of Syria in your thoughts and prayers.
