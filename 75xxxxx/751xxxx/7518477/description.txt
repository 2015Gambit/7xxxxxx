Description
As with most PC game downloads, you will need a program such as PowerISO or Daemon Tools to make this work properly.

In the download, there is the .iso, two good patches, the serial code, and four FAQs for the game.




Instructions to install:

1.) Mount or burn the image from the .iso
2.) Run the setup.exe
3.) Install the game. Do not change filepath (I could never get around errors whenever I changed the filepath), and enter the serial code. I tried to put the serial code visible enough in notepad, but follow the instructions on how to see it better if you have your notepad set to automatically have a certain font.
4.) Install the patches.
5.) Enjoy and purchase the game.
