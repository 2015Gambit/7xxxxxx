=====================================================

This is THE best and most comprehensive and important documentary made about the WTO meetings and protests. It delves deeply into the reasons people felt it important to take part in those historic proceedings. Essential viewing and still extremely relevant.

======================================================

Trade Off tells the story of the five days in Seattle that shook the world--November 29 through December 3, 1999--when the World Trade Organization's first meeting on U.S. soil was met with protests of tens of thousands of people from a broad coalition of diverse communities never seen before. Violent media images of "The Battle in Seattle" captured international headlines but did not answer key questions about what was at stake.

Shot entirely on location, this balanced overview of the protests moves through rallies, marches, street actions, and press conferences providing a voyeuristic exploration of this important week of protest and the people's movement that continues to build across the United States and around the world.

The issues raised by Trade Off are those faced by civil society--the effects of global trade policy on the environment and health, food and agriculture, labor and human rights, and the future of democracy around the world.
