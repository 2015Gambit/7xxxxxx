he show has some initial up-tempo numbers to get the audience set up, but then she delivers pure, undiluted, top-drawer 'furacão'. The 'Best of the Best' begin with the Lô Borges/Ronaldo Bastos title track,' "O Trem Azul" (The Blue Train) which is delivered near the beginning of the show and is repeated at the very end. Both versions are touching mid-tembo renditions of one of her favorite songs, which harkens back to the landmark CD by Mr Nacimento & the Clube da Esquina'. "Vento De Mao" (Winds of May) is pure joy to hear. The 'voice with guitar' waltz, " Valsa De Euridice", is overpoweringly beautiful with Elis hitting those incredible mid-range notes that only her voice could produce. "Menino do Rio" (River Boy) is hilarious. "Caxangá" (Crab) & "Maria, Maria", as a ballad that accelerates, are excellent. And the final recorded performance of her career, "O Trem Azul," is the show closer, pushing the envelope as Elis is overcome with emotion. To some Elis Regina was an acquired taste, but to me, and all of Brazil, she ranks with the finest female singers of all time: Maria Callas, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Sarah Vaughn, Ella, Kiri Ti Kanawa, Angela Gheroghiu, Alessandra Coletti, Jessye Norman, whoever: consider Ms Regina for your personal list. This performance is very reminiscent of the current shows by her daughter, Grammy-winner Maria Rita who has 100% of her mother's vocal DNA: unique, high energy, touching, nuanced, and very personal. All sung in sensual Brazilian Portuguese. HIghly Recommended as an ESSENTIAL recording for Elis Regina completists with the caution on the sound. Four OVERALL Stars for the CD, Five REMARKABLE Stars for Elis. She truly was Furacão (the hurricane).
