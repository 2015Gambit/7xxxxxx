,rajtalreja,2012-08-10T14:42Z,"Hello @Boobsman, I tried to download many times but its not downloading: Error: The system can not find the specific path., there are no peers are trackers.. can u plz suggest what could be the wrong ? beside i have already download ur NTSC version of this game and that download in couple of hrs, is there any way of convert that to PAL or region free? that one showing the error on ABGX360 which i have posted on ur ntsc version page."
[V],boobsman,2012-08-10T15:23Z,"@ rajtalreja sorry the issue must be at your end, the torrent works fine and i've just tested TPB magnet link on my home client with no issues. If you still cannot download just google the info hash at the top of the page to see where else this has been posted and download the actual torrent instead of magnet.

As for the other version that is NTSC/U only, you cannot convert it to work on PAL or Region Free and you'll need to download this version."

,secondwave89,2012-08-11T11:10Z,"hey boobsman, thanks for the great upload! i'd like to know whether will this work on LT 2.0 if i patch using 'final fantasy xiii-2 patch LT3.0 to LT2.0' which proves to be working on other titles as well? also, i tried truncate burn with imgburn and it says disc unreadable. help!"
[V],boobsman,2012-08-11T12:09Z,"@ secondwave89 i think the loop hole that allowed that patch to work has been fixed, not too sure though as i never really used it.

You should really update your firmware to LT3.0, i think this is why you've got the disc error as this game palys fine when truncate burned ;)"
,abdul86,2012-08-11T14:42Z,"@ boobsman thanks but actually, i already know it. i'm just informing the others."
[V],boobsman,2012-08-11T15:20Z,@ abdul86 why bother? its the same for all games when they first come out so no need ;)

,haseo0730,2012-08-11T18:36Z,"@boobsman It seems so. I've already wasted quite many discs just on trying to burn these XGD3 titles and so far only FFXIII-2 was successful with patched topology 2.0 
Guess I'll have to flash to 3.0"
,rajtalreja,2012-08-12T05:48Z,"Hi boobsman, this is first time it didn't work for me :( this time I used expensive disc just because of wonderful title :( 

I followed same steps like I used to do on other iso games..

I have LT3.0, I have made 33 disks for in a month since I purchased xbox360 :D
What is XGD3 ? "
,rajtalreja,2012-08-12T05:50Z,"following my above comment: This disc is unreadable ( burned process was successful also same steps as in PDF you wrote ),

,jankula,2012-08-12T12:31Z,"This upload works great!Must have LT-3.0,use img burn/turnicate metod,in case *disc is unreadable* leave burned disk overnight and Bingo works like charm! "
,rajtalreja,2012-08-12T13:50Z,"@jankula, buddy I am not new in burning, I have burned 35 in few weeks, did the same way and didn't work. I did truncate as well also used speed 2x like on all other games, i checked with abg360 as well, may be didn't support on my console or something went wrong but the disk was burned successfully and verified as well.
I don't want to take risk to waste another expensive disk as they are for data backups only, will buy some normal disks tom n try again."

what do you mean by this ? "

,Noitee,2012-08-12T14:34Z,"Game downloaded and burned just fine, but I couldn't install, it got to a point where it'd say it was unreadable. 
Burned another disk, same thing. Tried loading the game and it loaded just fine, then when I was given the task to go check the market the screen goes black and won't advance from there for some reason.

Any idea what happened? even verified the second time I burned just to be sure it wasn't a problem on my end. (using LT+3.0 ofc, no problem with other XGD3 games)"

I've never encountered this problem before with ISOs and hard drives. Has anyone else had problems playing from the ISO file using JTAG?  As I said before, this is the 'only' time I""ve had this problem. "
,carmelo7,2012-08-15T15:38Z,Are there polish subtitles in it ?
,SceneModz,2012-08-15T16:48Z,"Ok guys if you have a Jtag its alot easier to just extract the ISO using xbox360Iso extract.Then put the ""Sleeping dogs-SWAG"" folder on your hard drive in the ""Games"" folder.Then launch the game using Xexmenu or FSD.Get you an external hard drive to move files from PC to your 360 this process is easier than burning discs and it works almost every time.

Right now this and Darksider 2 are working perfectly on my Jtag I don't bother using my flashed drive at all.No updates or anything were needed the games just booted and play perfectly.Thanks Boobsman your ups are always legit.

@Friendlyguy 70 are you extracting the ISO to get the Sleeping Dogs-SWAG folder with all the files in it? Thats the only way cause 360 don't read ISO if you are extracting the ISO using 360ISOextractor and putting it in your ""Games"" folder then it has to work.

You guys can also try using ISOTOGOD and just convert the ISO to GOD format and put the GOD file that it makes with numbers in your ""Content"" but you need to use USBXTAF GUI to inject it to ""Content"" folder. "

,-Yuki-,2012-09-18T03:35Z,"For those who can't get the game working,remember that you have to patch with topology if you are using LT 2.0,no need of ihas burner,just truncate the damn thing,and it sould work(it will work,unless you're doing something wrong),it worked for me,i burned the same way i burn all my XGD3 games,and remember,you have to run through ABGX first,then you can patch with the topology,because the ABGX removes the patch,and also,don't forget to truncate"
