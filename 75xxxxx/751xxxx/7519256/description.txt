I converted various large formats of these episodes found on the net
some were 4gb in size for one episode! and others 1.5gb

so it cost me like 10gb and 5 hours to make these into a smaller

xvid 640x360p mp3 128 cbr 1000bit format

so gave problems with out of sync and the uploader of some of the sources
hasnt a clue what hes doing and uploaded interlaced flickering mpeg2s LOL

hows thats meant to be better quality beats me.. if only they could learn
how to use some video editing tool and at least make a non-interlaced mkv

oh well you have them now.. all I could find.. Ive blown my data cap of 120gb per month now


Info the show is about various families who hoard stuff and the children etc
try to help to get over their junk collecting habits and live in a house
like a normal person 


ENJOY and HELP SEED !!! .. dont limit upload speed and if you do you may be blocked by me.. stay off if your a bad seeder until it has atleast 20 seeders
otherwise
