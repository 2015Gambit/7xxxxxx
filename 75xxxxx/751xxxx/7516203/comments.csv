It takes them 45 minutes to even get to the ""haunted"" house the story is about. It gives you literally 2 scary scenes throughout the entire movie and they can be seen in the previews. Other than the girl behind the one guy and the other one getting snatched up into the attic, there are NO scary scenes whatsoever. The 2 that were supposed to be scary didn't even make my facial expression change. It was so non-scary because of the fact that they showed those only 2 parts in the trailer! The ending is so whack. At the beginning you hear a 9-1-1 call that one of the guys made to the cops, well at the end when they show him making the call, HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE CALL! Someone called HIM and he said all that 9-1-1 crap to the person who called HIM. lmao They don't show a single one of the guys dying. Everytime one of them disappear or die, the screen goes black! Just a stupid waste of time watching this movie. Don't waste your time.
