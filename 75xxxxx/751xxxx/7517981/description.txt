I specifically went out and paid the $5 for this album not because it was good, but because I hated their music so much that I felt the need to make sure it got out there so that no one else would have to buy it.

Had it up on demonoid before it went down so there's already a copy of it here but I've also got their other album, The End of Irony on TPB.

It's always a pleasure to deny the makers of shit-music a sale.
