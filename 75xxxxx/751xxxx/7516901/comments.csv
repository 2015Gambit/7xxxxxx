,xpmule,2012-08-10T00:44Z,"i don't know about these shows..
I like paranormal ones even that god damn douche bad from ""Ghost Adventures"" (they need to replace that guy lol)
But shows like this one where people just tell their stories seems kinda dumb..
People are not credible period. Its been proven scientifically that are perception of reality is limited and our memory degrades instantly. I don't trust eye witness testimony at all. Although i guess ii could see some entertainment value in these shows but i can't be bothered.."
[V],psspss,2012-08-10T01:56Z,"you can see the full investigation on the docu called the worlds most scariest ghosts most have seen it


this gave more insight in to the background and lead up to the haunting.. obviously some legal stuff happened as they could only  show some parts of the real Para team

I actually love this episode after all

its more like a_haunting though"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-10T08:07Z,"I'm with xpmule on this one....exept the GAC part,Zack makes the show.nothing funnier than a big bad tough guy freaking out over a floor creeking,thou he's gotten better about that over the years.as far as this show goes its just hollywood trying to cash in on whats hot at the time.most people watch this kind of stuff just to hold them over til Ghost Adventures or Ghost Hunters start their new seasons"
,m8-t,2012-08-13T03:13Z,"This story and footage was on ""Sightings"" almost a couple of decades ago. It was fishy then too."
[V],Masterzilla,2012-08-15T11:40Z,Thanx
