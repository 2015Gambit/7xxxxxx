,{me},2012-08-17T06:48Z,"Despite the previous commentor's attitude he is absolutely correct. You should NEVER password protect an upload on The Bay (or anywhere else for that matter). You should also NEVER upload a multitude of content, such as multiple individual files, in a single container (i.e. .iso, .zip, .rar, etc.) Also ANY torrent that results in you filling out a survey IS COMPLETE JUNK. Do not do it, or do so at your own retarded risk. 
This download has way too many red flags and should not be trusted by anyone. The uploader should be ashamed but he probably doesn't speak enough English to understand the level of filth he inhabits. Poor 1993svean gave them all of his info (hopefully all false info). Avoid this download at all costs. The risk is not worth it. There are other torrents (with far more seeds) with the same content that don't hide it from you. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD

Unhappy pirating on this torrent unfortunately.

A far more reputable alternative:

But do not take my word for it. Investigate it for yourself thoroughly first. DON'T TRUST ANYONE :) 

Happy Pirating"
