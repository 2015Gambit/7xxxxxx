,mountainsAnachronistic,2012-08-10T13:46Z,The original pdf that's been around for some time was all images and therefore not searchable. I had to extract the  955 images. Then I used OCR to change them to text. The scans were 300 DPI and were not accurate. So I converted to 600 DPI. Lastly They had to be recompiled as epub format (AABBY finereader). The result is a much smaller searchable epub. While not perfect recognition it seems pretty good. I hope it works for you.
