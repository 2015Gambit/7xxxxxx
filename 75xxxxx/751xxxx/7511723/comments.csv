If you cannot play this version you cannot play other versions listed on Piratebay too ,because all versions use the same crack"
,jackal195,2012-08-27T23:51Z,"Works great. Only problem was it said Audiox2 did not download correctly and to install directx 9 or higher and reinstall the game. This caused me to have no sound for the game. I checked and i have directx 11. I'm sure its just a problem with my computer that I will have to work out. Other than that, kudos on a great torrent!"
,Jawa8,2012-08-31T04:25Z,Does this have all the dlc or just the mercer skin? =O
,Titley,2012-09-02T15:27Z,Does the DLC works or not?
