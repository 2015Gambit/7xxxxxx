Stanza 3.1, WeatherEye 2.3.9, These two apps are impossible to find if you are still running iOS 3.1. They work well before all the updates happened. There was no need to upgrade. I backed up these apps and want to share with anyone who needs it.
These were FREE apps, but no longer can be found in iTunes.
