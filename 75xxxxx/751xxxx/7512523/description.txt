This ISO includes the first 200 issues of Linux Journal.

Linux Journal, currently celebrating its 17th year of publication, is the original magazine of the global Linux community, delivering readers the advice and inspiration they need to get the most out of their Linux systems.

In-depth information provides a full 360-degree look at featured topics relating to Linux, giving a comprehensive source of everything readers need for creating and completing their own projects -- not just tools they will use today, but relevant and encompassing information they will turn to in future months and years. In addition to how-to content, Linux Journal includes opinions, new product information, profiles of leaders making major contributions in Open Source and product reviews. It also covers business, social and technical news and developments in order to fulfill its mission as the central forum and advocate for the greater Linux community throughout the world.

Linux Journal was first published in April 1994 by Phil Hughes and Bob Young, co-founder of Red Hat. Hughes went on to continue publishing Linux Journal for more than a decade, and in 2006, he handed the reins to long-time LJ employee Carlie Fairchild. Fairchild is the founder of Belltown Media, Inc., the current publisher of Linux Journal.

Today, Linux Journal's very own superstar Doc Searls, recently named one of the Top 100 Most Influential People in IT by eWeek, executive editor Jill Franklin and associate editor Shawn Powers lead the way with inspiring editorial direction for the magazine. Regular LJ contributors include a list of Linux luminaries, such as Kyle Rankin, Reuven Lerner, Dave Taylor, Mick Bauer, Zack Brown and Bill Childers, just to name a few.
