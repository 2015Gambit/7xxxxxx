peace from hawaii"
,just1aim,2012-08-07T20:29Z,first torrent srry
,Matinator10,2012-08-07T22:41Z,Its not even needed to run the game...it gives me the error every time it starts but I have played for hundreds of hours without any crashes etc
,wsg1991,2012-08-08T05:02Z,but for a game that old it's strangely slow on my PC ; perhaps because of that file 
,just1aim,2012-08-10T22:17Z,@wsg1991 this is a dynamic link library file it does not make the game slow
,just1aim,2012-08-10T22:22Z,this file may not be required to play however it completes your .dll files so there are no graphic or gpu unhandeld exceptions i.e. game crashes do to graphic card failure adjust game play through options in game also this file belongs in system32 i believe thanks to seeders its appropriate for it to be on the pirate bay so i figured id help
