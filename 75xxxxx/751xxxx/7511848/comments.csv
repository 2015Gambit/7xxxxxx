,asarokk,2012-08-08T20:31Z,"Hey xbt, I can already do combat while horse riding, so this torrent will work and I can play Dawnguard?

I don't have to go through any complications, just install and play? "
,-xbt-,2012-08-09T13:12Z,"Yes, just install and play, should not have any issues."
,NeToXXX,2012-08-10T01:41Z,"Fighting while on a horse works for me, but i can't get the damn quest to start. No hold guard is talking about dawnguard, and i cant find the guy named Durak either. any sugestions?"

,asarokk,2012-08-12T03:36Z,Yay! Workes great! I haven't encountered any glitches or bugs so far. :) 
,americant1984,2012-08-12T23:02Z,"I can use weapons while mounted but the quest wont start. None of the guards are talking about it and durak has not appeared. I am a level 33 and I have gone on foot to the location its supposed to be and there's nothing there. 

Any thoughts?"
,americant1984,2012-08-13T00:15Z,SUCCESS! It turns out you have two separate ini files to edit.
