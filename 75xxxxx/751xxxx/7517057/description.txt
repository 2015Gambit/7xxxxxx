Description:
The film concerns the sexual awakening of Billy (Rex Roman), an inept teenager who undergoes a series of humiliating, but nevertheless arousing experiences. His Aunt Opel (Jacque Hanson) introduces him to oral sex. His teenage cousins handcuff him and rape him.
His peculiar traumatic experiences cause him to develop an insecurity about his ability to have a sexual relationship with a woman, as well as a fetish for peanut butter. A young John Holmes, affecting an Irish accent, plays a seeming friend who piles further humiliation upon Billy.
Finally Billy meets a soul mate in Priscilla, but we are left with an ambivalent conclusion. The non-consensual situations may leave some uncomfortable, but watching Billy's bumbling early sexual experiences be even more trying.
