Supreme Ruler 2010 is a real-time strategy game that combines elements of politics, military sims, and economic sims, in order to create a very in-depth and remarkably complex game.

Version 4.61 has many performance improvements but unfortunately the multiplayer will not work without a second additional valid key.  One valid key is included.

The game was originally released in May, 2005, and no one ever came up with a working keygen to defeat the protection on this game.

I would tell you to buy the game if you like it but I wasn't thrilled with Supreme Ruler 2020 or the newest one.

Enjoy.
