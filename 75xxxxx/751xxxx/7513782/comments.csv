[V],psspss,2012-08-08T08:22Z,"I checked E16 all seems there to me.. credits show its the full 21minutes.. so I dont know what
your talking about

I dont think my files were damage or fat error

i think you have been got by the anti p2p crowd
as 45 seeders were fake right off

prob didnt have Peer block 1.1 installed right?

quality is as good as I normally do"
[V],psspss,2012-08-08T08:25Z,"either that all you need to scandisk your own pc
and have a bad drive your downloading too
reboot

and then reclick on the torrent again and do a force recheck to recheck the chunks against the HASH file"

[V],psspss,2012-08-08T10:56Z,"perhaps someone can confirm both are ok
and tick quality as I dont believe the first poster
as I watch both and saw nothing wrong"
