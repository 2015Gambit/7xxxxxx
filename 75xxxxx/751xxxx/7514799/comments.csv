If it isnt at any changelog then maybe it will encrypt them fine or it will be added in the next versions."
,Alpha.Omega,2012-08-08T17:14Z,"i have tried both activator v1.1 and 1.2 but just the same in the end it says ........cannot be activated... error blah blah....., the watermark btw was removed by the watermark auto remover.

Why do you upload useless stuff?"
,bert16,2012-08-08T20:10Z,I can't open the KMS activator files. Even when typing in the PW I get error messages. Why use a PW when it's there for everyone to see?

That site is where Windows Loader by DAZ is originaly released.

i say this because apex2000 is right 100%
I couldn't agree more !"
