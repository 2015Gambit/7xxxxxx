,frstimr,2012-08-17T06:23Z,"I bought this game after playing the 0.8.5.2 that you uploaded. I wouldn't have if I just played the demo, I need more time to make that decision because of the limited time I have for games. So thanks! Maybe the dev should thank you too, but I wouldn't count on it. =P"

I bought the game too :) Devs are getting enough support, they're not complaining and if they start I'll donate them. Anyway, new(0.8.9) version was just released and I will seed it as soon as it reaches Desura. Stay tuned!"
