,Chugalugg,2012-08-26T18:33Z,"ingr.osei, you were already told what to do and you've done nothing and how long has it been now? Your a fucking douche and that's all there is to it. Personally, I think your enjoying this shit. As for contributions to this community, I've done my share. I've had to keep changing accounts as Comcast has pulled my service more than once or throttled my connections. I've been around here when you were still pissing in your diaper. Now close that big set of African plate lips, you cunt. "
