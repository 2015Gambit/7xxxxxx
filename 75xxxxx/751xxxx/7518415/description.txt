
Plot: Veteran actor Michael Beihn (The Terminator, Aliens) follows up his 2010 directorial debut The Blood Bond with this neo-grindhouse thriller set in the deep woods. Annie (Jennifer Blanc) and her friend Mary (Danielle Harris) were just looking top party in the great outdoors when they hooked up with a pair of Sheriff’s Deputies (Ryan Honey and Denny Kirkwood) who like to play rough. When Mary dies at one of their hands, lone witness Annie makes a narrow escape. Upon encountering Kyle (Beihn), a grizzled ex-con who lives alone in the woods, Annie begs for help in escaping her sadistic pursuers. But who is the real victim here, and how far will the two crooked cops really go to cover up their heinous crime?
