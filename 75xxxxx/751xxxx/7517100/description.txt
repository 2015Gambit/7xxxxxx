Members of Fred's soccer team are attacked by the Dark Lilith on Mount Diabla and lose the team's lucky soccer ball. As the gang begins to investigate, the monster attacks them and a band of hillbillies at their camp in nearby Scorpion Ridge. One of the hillbillies, named "Ugly Jimmy," catches Daphne's eye as, unlike the rest of the tribe, he is handsome and muscular. Jimmy decides to help the gang solve the mystery. The gang falls into a cave and meets an amnesiac explorer calling herself "Boron" who is holding Fred's soccer ball, believing it to be her lover. She leads the gang to the Dark Lilith's hideout after the monster attacks Jimmy; the hideout turns out to be an old Spanish galleon. After solving the mystery, the gang drives off unaware they're being watched by the ghost of a Conquistador, which fades away as they return to town.
