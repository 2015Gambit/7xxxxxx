,notouchx,2012-08-08T02:09Z,"I can confirm that this is episode 67, the nomination episode.  We are missing episode 66, the day before nominations, because all of the posted episode 66 torrents were actually episode 65.

Ignore dascratch; it is a bot that posts to all of sceneline's torrents.  Notice that only sceneline posts the 720p version of BBUK."
