thanks a lot"
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-11T01:26Z,What a RELIEF! Finally a movie that I could like. I am surprised it didn't get a higher rating. Probably because a couple of DOOFUS Characters. They could have made this movie a HECK of a lot better. But I am still happy with what I got. It was so much better than those Major Flying Turds from Hollywood that must've hit a Galaxy sized Fan and dropped TPB. Enjoy the movie.

V/8

Quality is superb and only on a very high-end system could I notice lower audio fidelity and every so slightly muted picture. Probably would not be noticeable on an average HD system. Decent lower budget movie, kept me interested but nothing spectacular. "
