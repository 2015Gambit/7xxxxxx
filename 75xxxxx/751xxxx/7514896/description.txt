comments:
This concert is the last of a 5 week, mostly club and small venue tour 
before they started playing some slightly larger places. it was featuring
music from "the bends" (their 2nd album release), but their biggest hit
was probably "creep", not to be confused with Stone Temple Pilots song
of same name that came out soon after Radiohead's (completely different song).
not long after this, seeing Radiohead in a club gig became impossible, as they 
became a major concert attraction in many parts of the world. Fake plastic trees
became a pretty big hit too. 

this is the whole rebroadcast of the concert.
the tape was flipped after lucky ended, before creep started so none of the
music is cut.
