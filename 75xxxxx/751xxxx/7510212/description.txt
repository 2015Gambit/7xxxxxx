Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Monday, August 6 edition of the Alex Jones Show, host Mike Adams dissects the Sikh shooting in Wisconsin, its telltale military attributes, and the attempt by the government and the corporate media to connect it to supposed white supremacists and characterize it as domestic terrorism. He looks into the eerie similarities between this shooting and the Aurora, Colorado mass shooting two weeks ago. 

Mike also talks with Michael Schmidt, a Ontario farmer who has been in a protracted legal battle over selling and producing raw milk. Schmidt's co-op farm was recently raided by federal inspectors. 

Mike also covers a scam by Susan G. Komen For The Cure to oversell the supposed benefits of mammography.
