,skullhill,2012-08-09T03:18Z,"A 8

V 8

best one so far"
,Reyter2007,2012-08-09T04:12Z,"A little dark, some flicker and cropped a little too much but by far the best copy yet. A7 V6 or for a cam, A9 V8."
,faroe323,2012-08-09T04:15Z,v6 a6 better than the first copy
,klip1,2012-08-09T09:54Z,"thnx so much for this man!

hopefully not to much of the actual picture is cropped.

from samples i see:

A/V = easy 7's"
,chewy446,2012-08-09T10:09Z,"A-8 clear and synced
V-6 Blurry but watchable"
,baelferuz,2012-08-09T13:26Z,"I'll wait for a clearer copy , I want to see those triple boobs clearly lol"
,vickypep,2012-08-09T16:07Z,eyxaristw!!!
,SchichtimSchacht,2012-08-09T17:35Z,"Boring Movie.Original one was a lot better!

But watchable ;)

V: 6
A: 7"
,Neraforesta,2012-08-09T21:37Z,"Just finished watching all the way through. ehh.... Very watchable compared to the file before. Cropped a lil to much, but ild still give it a A/V 8/6 for a cam. Contrary to what other critics are saying about the movie. Considering it from an objective side, it is completely different from the original, and that is the only chance it had with a gayfag like collin farrell. The movie was actually pretty awesome imo. Check it out for yourself, and don't sit there thinking you are gonna be watching some daft remake of a Schwartzemheimen movie, cause there isn't even one iota of Mars or Aliens or even the greatest man on the planet Micheal Ironside, BUT...This movie does have two of the hottest bitchez on the planet atm with vampire chick and the other cockholster hottie. Give it a try with a mentality that you are watching something completely new, and you wont be disappointed. :).... p.s. I still don't have any idea what I would do with a 3 tittied chick... do you?"

,darkko,2012-08-10T04:03Z,"Neraforesta made me LOL.

Seriously though, when is ""The Cabin In The Woods"" going to come? 

thanks to the uploader!!

TITTIES for EVERYONE!!! 

keep Demonoid in your thoughts folks!"
,GRbahamas,2012-08-10T04:31Z,SEED!!!!!!!
,klip1,2012-08-10T05:34Z,"came back to say i take my earlier 7 ratings down to a 3 or 4.

cropped fucked me in the face, turned it off after ten minutes.

:-(

waiting for a better copy...  and im usually a cheap date."
,Neraforesta,2012-08-10T07:35Z,Klips is obviously a hater of movies w/o midgets. 8P
,Fritz.,2012-08-10T08:09Z,"neraforesta review is amusing a vulgar and moronic way, but realistically it just shows how sheltered his life really is to think these are the 2 hottest bitches on the planet. They are attractive women, but not even close to the hottest women on the planet.

just goes to show how much media influences small minded folks.

"
,Galtar0420,2012-08-10T10:27Z,"I just checked it out
A=7
V=6
to blurry for me. Ill wait 
thanks to the uploader"
,numse,2012-08-10T10:49Z,another desperate upload! srsly some people needs to get a fucking life instead of downloading or uploading shit like this...
,Mshake,2012-08-10T11:13Z,"Fritz. sounds like he's trolling pretty hard. Take no mind. I'm not sure why this A/V is getting such high ratings. It's very much too blurry and too cropped. 
A 8
V 5 (maybe a 4 but recorded with HD camera)

Still very watchable. Thanks to Illuminati and scene4all again for having the best copy as usual too.
Long live pirates of the bay...Me thinks its time to donate to this site, Arghhhh (pirate noise)"
,ufalum88,2012-08-10T13:51Z,"Very dark, very hard to watch.

A - 7
V - 4

Mehhh."
,saint84,2012-08-10T15:44Z,"movie disappointing . story too flat . i found the first one with the martians and mutans so much more in the sci-fy . this is too plain. 
as far as the video,  the other copy from unique was better when i compared both , more color and sharper "
,Fritz.,2012-08-10T18:16Z,"@mshake ever seen a swimsuit edition, or a playboy, and those come out all the time...

while i would like to point out how if a person gets out in the real world they will see beautiful women every day, i think that point would be lost on the basement dwellers who would read this comment."
,zmogusnr1,2012-08-10T20:20Z,I'd suggest everyone to wait for a dvd rip.
,Flamestrike,2012-08-10T21:17Z,Wait for the DVD rip. this movie is good but the cam doesn't do it justice.
,THEnrique,2012-08-10T22:28Z,"V>4
A>6"
,Ljepone,2012-08-10T23:26Z,"I find the ""Total recall"" from 1990 with Arnold Schwarzenegger & Sharon Stone much better!"
,talia_burke,2012-08-10T23:49Z,Thank you for sharing!
,skullhill,2012-08-11T04:05Z,Sharpen in VLC works wonders. Use it. Fixes the slight blurriness.

,starsprite3,2012-08-11T09:52Z,Very different than first Total Recall.  Blurry but watchable.  Echoes.  Cropped quite a bit.  A:7; V:7  Share ratio: 1.7  seeded 2.35gb. 
,tomo2005,2012-08-11T22:31Z,"can normally watch cams or whatever but this ones 
unwatchable for me  but nuf respect to uploader as always n will seed"
,TiznaraN,2012-08-12T03:42Z,"""three tits"" it's a remake of an older movie you realize?  from like the 80's or early 90's, the govenator was in it.  anyways that one had it too except it was make up , this bitch actually had it surgically done"
,Chased911,2012-08-12T03:49Z,"In all honesty, it's very high quality.

I give it:

V = 8
A = 8
M = 9

Well worth the download."
,psychoticbitch,2012-08-12T04:08Z,"Audio 8
video 2"
,...TPB...,2012-08-12T06:08Z,You mean like YOU Fritz
,K1bbler,2012-08-12T13:32Z,Why do people keep thinking this is a remake and comparing it to the first total recall. This is an independent adaptation of the book just like the first movie. Saying the first total recall is better just makes you look like an idiot.

,legio9,2012-08-13T23:08Z,"Best quality that this uploader has done so far.

Based on simple quality of viewing, no matter the format:

V: 5
A: 6

Passable,  worth a download, but can get better.

As per the movie itself: Aside of the name and the ""memory suppression"" idea , this ""remake"" has nothing in common with the original; so the less of 30 year old will appreciate it, while the contemporary of the original will find it  an ""empty vessel"" when all the special effects are tossed aside.

Taste is of a personal nature; some will like, some don't."
,YardBoy,2012-08-14T02:18Z,"+1 to the UL'er, thanks for being a contributor.  
Re-paid in kind 12.0X.  You?
Very watchable for a cam right of center screen: V7
Audio from the TS is even better: A9
Sure beats waiting months for the DVD rip."
,patolya,2012-08-14T11:36Z,"Great Quality for a CAM
I give it a good solid 8 for ""Audio"" and ""Video"".
Few second of blur here and there but really good movie to watch. Do not listen to some people, you can download this movie and enjoying the movie!"
,Bohr999,2012-08-14T12:31Z,The only reason for seeing this movie must be Kate Beckinsale.... She is total vixen!! 
,44mdcc44,2012-08-14T15:07Z,"Fritz. ..
 always with the sardonic comments.. you cracked me up this otherwise slow tuesday .. and neraforesta ... thanks for the review, helpful but have to agree with fritz, i have travelled the world extensively ( army brat ) and i have seen some women that would make justin beeber turn straight.. "
,missworld,2012-08-14T22:52Z,"TiznaraN You cannot be that big of a moron to believe that the working actress in question, Kaitlyn Leeb, actually had cosmetic surgery to gain an extra breast? Double digit I.Q? chromosome issues? Maybe just dumb as fucking soup?"
,waldoe,2012-08-16T00:54Z,"""Contrary to what other critics are saying about the movie. Considering it from an objective side, it is completely different from the original""
Although I have not yet watched this movie, I have read plot summaries and seen the screenshots.... How is it completely different, I mean, I still see a chick with 3 tits in the screenshot. I'll have to wait and see for myself your review might be completely spot on Neraforesta. I hope it's not completely the same.... there's no imagination left they all just copy older ideas..."
[T],Djofullinn,2012-08-16T05:09Z,I think itÂ´s a pretty decent effort. Thanks and good luck.
,apirateslifeforme,2012-08-18T01:57Z,"^ sanelama ^

really? for fuck sakes be a douche somewhere else!

Cam but Totally watchable on a laptop size screen for sure
bitch if you want but it was free which in my book tends to add a bit of curve on the critique

Thanks scene4all"
