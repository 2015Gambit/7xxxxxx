Any chance you have Anthony Bourdain's Get Jiro?  

Also sorry for maybe putting up too many requests, but I'm also looking for Fury Max #5, Planet of the Apes #13-16, Extermination #2, Space: 1999 - Classics Remastered #1, Godland #32-33 Judge Bao Vol. 1 #2-4, and Mumbai Confidential #1 or #2 to see if its any good.  Any help in finding these would be greatly appreciated."
