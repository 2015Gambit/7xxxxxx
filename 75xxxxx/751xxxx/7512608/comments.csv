Why not install KMEAW 3.55 CFW?

You will get the best compatibility.. 3.41 is outdated."
,super1313,2012-08-07T23:57Z,"beacause it took me 2 years to collect over 300 games, I dont want to redo all of them"
,dududus,2012-08-08T00:45Z,"You don't need to redo a single game.. 

3.55 will play any game that works on 3.41 or lower.

I was on 3.41 with my dongle, installed 3.55 and every game that worked before still works, plus all the new ones."
,super1313,2012-08-09T22:49Z,You dont have to go back through and replace all the eboot fixes from 3.41 to 3.55?
,dududus,2012-08-12T01:19Z,"super

no, i can promise you that every eboot that runs on 3.41 will also run on 3.55"
