,AlastorSX,2012-08-18T22:50Z,"Wow, didn't expect to find a torrent for this so easily. I have played it twice on the PS3 and never finished. Was a fun game, and this time, I plan on finishing it."
,AlastorSX,2012-08-21T19:55Z,"By the way, if anyone is having trouble opening the .dvd in IMGburn, open the properties for both files, and look where the (2010)-- is. One of them has a space ""(2010) --"" and the other doesn't. ""(2010)--"" I had this problem, and just putting a space between the (2010) and 2 dashes fixed it. It is a legit torrent. Thanks again Smallz94!"
