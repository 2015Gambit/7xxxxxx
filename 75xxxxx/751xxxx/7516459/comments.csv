,Gegia,2012-08-09T10:51Z,No the latest version as of now is 0.9.6
,Gegia,2012-08-09T10:53Z,"Here is whats in this version
  UPDATES (v0.9.6)
----------------
*  Fog now starts out almost non-existant, and gets more dense as more pages are collected.

*  Enabled the enemy to appear more often in areas you just can't see (previously, he would avoid appearing in
areas you weren't facing, so this will allow him to appear, for example, in front of you but behind a tree).
*  Added a 1-second cooldown after jogging/sprinting before your stamina starts to recover.  Your flashlight
also swings back up in front of you a little bit slower than before.

*  Reduced the enemy's speed slightly to compensate for the above two changes.
*  Added more to the Options menu.  You can now change the mouse sensitivity, and tweak a few extra graphics
options (which should hopefully help with framerate issues).
*  Fixed a bug where the enemy would sometimes appear partially inside a wall.

*  Fixed a bug where tree leaves would light up if the flashlight was anywhere near the tree.  Also added a small
amount of wind movement on the leaves.

*  Removed ""Map"" button from input control list (there was never a map).
