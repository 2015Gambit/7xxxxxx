Naturopathic physical medicine incorporates a wide array of methods, techniques and modalities, many of which are explored in this text, along with the evidence and rationale for their use in health care. As explained in depth in this book, the use of physical medicine in a naturopathic context may focus on the treatment and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal dysfunction, or it may be employed in treatment of both major and minor health problems in order to enhance and encourage self-regulatory functions.
It is important to note that naturopathic practitioners in different states, provinces and countries practice physical medicine as part of their clinical care of
patients, in accordance with local laws and licensing regulations which are anything but uniform. For example, in North America and Canada naturopathic education results in qualifi cation as licensed primary care naturopathic physicians through state or provincial boards of medical examiners.
In contrast, in Europe and Australia (as examples), a naturopathic qualifi cation leads to a more limited scope of practice, unless additional qualifi cations (DO, DC, PT, MD, etc.) are also held. To an extent these differences are refl ected in the physical medicine (and other) methods utilized and, in some instances, to the conditions treated.
The continuum of manual methods employed in naturopathic clinical practice may (depending on licensing variations) incorporate both static and motion palpation, as well as a wide variety of soft tissue techniques, joint articulation, mobilization without impulse (joint play), as well as mobilization with impulse. Mobilization with impulse is also referred to as high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust technique and, because of concerns as to safety, this modality is deserving of some explanation (Hurwitz et al 2005).
