Here is 2004 Olympic Gold Medal winner Alina Kabaeva in a Japanese video which highlights her training and Rhythmic Gymnastics routines.

Alina Kabaeva RSG Training & Demonstration 2004: This 88 Minute video was made in 2004 following the Athens Olympics for the Japanese Market and features Alina training, demonstrating 4 apparatus and an Interview.

The dialogue is in Russian with Japanese subtitles hard-coded in the video.

The RG routines had the option of 3 different camera angles on the DVD. I took the footage from each angle, so you will see each routine three times (Medium, Close-up, and Full-floor angles).
