,linakhlewi,2012-08-06T23:02Z,please breaking bad season 4 :( i'm waiting :( when are you gonna upload it ? please tell me :(
,mike953100,2012-08-06T23:13Z,"@linakhlewi 

It is on my list, but there is a thing or two in front of it.  I did not encode seasons 1-3; they were done by VisionX.  However, his encode of Season 4 was from HDTV rips, and I do not want to download/watch/upload HDTV rips when there are BluRays out there.  However, I will need to download the BluRay of it (big size ~25-30gb), which will take a while.  I will then need to encode it (13 hour or so episodes=a couple days or so to encode).  So, do not expect it anytime soon, although I will try to have it done in a two weeks or less, hopefully earlier."

@ mike953100

Your presentations of your uploads are really great, especially 
when you can't go back and re-edit anything

.... And you started up some 8 weeks ago .... I have a feeling that 
you had some kind of history before that .... ( ha ha .... Don't answer ) ....

Anyway great to see ""the new kids on the block"" doin so well !"

Thank you!  And actually I have only been doing this for 8 weeks.  I got annoyed not being able to find most TV Series/Mini-Series in 720p at sizes smaller than 2.18gb or 1.45gb for an hour.  So after some googling, I found out about video encoding and a program to use.  I also was annoyed with there being no info on video and audio in most torrents.  So, after some more googling, I found the program Mediainfo, which shows video/audio bitrates, codecs, etc.  Throughout the weeks, I have just figured out how to do all this stuff and here I am.

By the way, if you read this again agentbay, how do uploaders get to be Trusted or VIP?

Thanks again!"
,andrei.92brb,2012-08-07T07:45Z,thanks for this

Obviously you really are a fast learner, and media-info ( by the way ) is really a great little program !

Has saved my _ _ _ a lot of times when downloading from 
russian Uploaders, because my ""Kyrillic"" is not that good ....

( Just download the IFO - file connected to the VOB's in VIDEO_TS uploads., and 
most of the info are available from that tiny little IFO file )

==========================

Pink and green skull's : 

VIP-skulls are 100 percent up to the Moderators, and i understand that they don't 
want to ""negotiate"" about that .... ( I tried to ""bribe"" them once , but .... No, just kidding ) ....

Pink-skulls are the same since the last year or something ....
( Before 2012 you could ""suggest"" Uploaders at the ""Forum"", but thats not OK today )

Mods are tough guy's, but i guess they're keeping an eye on you ( Ha Ha Ha )....

Definitely the best copy for its size.  Great job on the audio, usually 6 channels are at least 2.5gig so thanks for small size"

Thanks for the response-that's good to know!  I'll keep my fingers crossed I got one of them some day.

@ zeroheritage

You are welcome!  And thanks for commenting!"
,Bren0,2012-08-08T08:56Z,"Hey Mike, just checked the first few mins of your rip and it looks to be of great quality for the filesize/bitrate. Well done! 
I typically go for higher bitrates (around 2Mbps or a smidge higher) for movies containing a lot of fast moving imagery (eg action type stuff) but for this type of film, the chosen bitrate and encode settings appear to be spot on. 
I'll be back to comment on A/V properly once I've watched the whole thing. 

Cheers mate. "
