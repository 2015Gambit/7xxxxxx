,sputnikwood,2012-08-13T01:27Z,"will have liked to get this but the audio bitrate is way TOO LOW 68.5, thats like half the bitrate of a standard 128kbs mp3 song.

there are lots of artifact in sound when bitrate is that low."
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-08-13T08:32Z,"@sputnikwood 

You cant compare MP3 with AAC !

Read study and learn before you make a fool off yourselves."
,DPic,2012-08-14T10:26Z,"Actually you can. And 96 is considered low for both of them, nevermind "
,DPic,2012-08-14T10:29Z,"nevermind less than 70*

,DPic,2012-08-15T00:45Z,"Yes, it is better than MP3. That doesn't mean you can get the same quality with less than half the bitrate. It's better, it's not magic. "
,DPic,2012-08-15T02:11Z,"Just because it is better doesn't mean you can't compare the two at all. They are of comparable quality. 

If you really want to use a quality audio codec, you would choose Ogg Vorbis. It's great because it is an open and free format. The quality is better than AAC: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis#Quality:_Codec_comparisons
http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/AAC_vs_Ogg_Vorbis#Sound_quality

But that's not the point. The point is that all of these lossy codecs are comparable, and that anything below 96kbps (which is already low) is unacceptable for quality sound from any of them. "

Take that here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=11

And FEEL FREE to NOT DL anoXmous rip!"
,DPic,2012-08-15T21:39Z,Sorry. You seemed happy discussing until I provided proof. I appreciate the upload. I'm just trying to let you know about audio compression and codecs because you were yelling at people that were trying to tell you the same thing. 
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-08-16T03:52Z,"@DPic  You have NO prof ! 

And you just a trolling spammer now! 

This is a another prof : 

DTS-HD Master Audio is better than .ogg !

And stop think that you can learning me a shit !

First off, would like to thank Zen for the download, fantastic quality. 

Second, how do I turn on the subtitles?

Thanks in advance for any and all help."
