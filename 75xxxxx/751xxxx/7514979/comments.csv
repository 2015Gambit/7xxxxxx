,DanielRibeiroMarinho,2012-08-09T21:46Z,"@dawnfx well, in that case i don't know how to answer you, but boobsman said :  this is NTSC/U only, it will not work on J or PAL consoles, those will be posted as they become available :)
i don't know how you can run ntsc games in your console, never worked with me, even old games and i patched then with a program to convert ntsc to pal. i guess you really have to wait just like most of people.
Cheers.

 There is no verified rip of Xex CRC 079B6601 in the online database,
Failed to find a verified ini file for this Xex,
Verification failed is it something to do with ONLINE?"

[V],boobsman,2012-08-10T15:33Z,"@ rajtalreja as i have already said in comments for the region free version you cannot convert, you must download the version that's correct for your console!

As for the Xex this is a pre release game, there will not be a verified version in the database until its released in the shops."
