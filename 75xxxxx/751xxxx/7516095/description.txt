Very colorful playing by Brent who is playing on a generally effect-less keyboard circa 82' style. He dosn't need effects, the man was brilliant.

The second set especially is sweet!
Touch>Throwing Stones> Franklins. I think this is the only time they did that. Nice to hear that spacey early Throwing Stones space.

Everyone is in good form. Up there as one of the better shows of 82' along with some other hot shows mainly August thru October.
