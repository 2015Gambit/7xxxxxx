Ubisoft: Making your kids comfortable with genocide 1 video game at a time. And don't forget to enlist in the military! Oil prices are getting higher and we will need to invade another country soon."

Blocking any program from accessing the internet


In order to block the game from having access to the internet from Windows Firewall, follow these instructions (if you are running a Windows 7 OS) :

Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Advanced Settings (on the left) > Outbound Rules (on the left) > New Rule (on the right)

-- Make sure Program is bubbled in
-- This program path: (guide it to the .exe directory)
-- Block the Connection
-- Domain, Private, and Public should be checked
-- Name it whatever you want (description is optional)


And you should be done!   Have fun! And please remember to SEED! Even ""if"" the game isn't good or not!"
