,Eter_Puralis,2012-08-17T14:49Z,"Wow, talk about a stab in the dark that payed off! :O Thank you! Do you have it the other way around, too? I have a friend who has seen it 5 times  in the cinema, and she preferred Benedict as Frankenstein and Lee Miller as the creature. Kinda makes sense to me too.. Tho i want to compare too! :D "
,Zooey_Cross,2012-08-24T11:38Z,"Wow, I can't believe this version is finally up, too!  THANK YOU!!!

Eter_Puralis : The other version was the first version shared here so it's already up.

Also, I saw both versions too, but me and my friend actually prefer Benedict as the Creature. He's taller, has a more unusual face and most importantly, his Creature seems deeper, more emotional and more intellectual. Not to mention his little movements which were absent in Jonny's version.

I think it's a matter of preferation on how you want to look at the Creature."
,Eter_Puralis,2012-08-25T23:39Z,"Zooey_Cross Ah, so it is. I was searching for it wrong.

Of course it's a matter of opinion. Watching Benedict's creature now... So.... cute. Ehm. Loving it :D"
