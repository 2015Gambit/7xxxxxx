,jnikolow1,2012-08-26T22:23Z,"I messed around with other torrents for SO LONG and couldn't get the game to work!!

Then I downloaded this torrent and it was so unbelievably simple ... just install and play!!  

Thanks so much for this!!  The game would crash everyone once in a great while but I just saved continually so it wasn't a big deal.

As for suggestions ... maybe Riven or Exile next ?  =) thanks!"

Welcome to your new home, and thank you so much for your great uploads, and I'll seed whatever  I download, and I'm looking forward for more great uploads, and the trilogy of fallout as you promised. "
