Pure Pwnage is an Internet-distributed mockumentary series from ROFLMAO Productions. The fictional series purports to chronicle the life and adventures of Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale), a Canadian self-proclaimed pro gamer. Originating in 2004, eighteen episodes of the series have been released to date. In 2007 the creators of the show estimated their current viewer base to be over three million. The series is filmed primarily in Toronto but has also included scenes filmed in Calgary, Montreal, and the Netherlands.


Inspired by the style of Trailer Park Boys, the show has now migrated to TV on Canadian channel Showcase. This TV series is somewhat separate from the web series in that is does not strictly follow on from it's story, instead re-imagining some episodes from the web series for the new TV audience. The web series is also still in production and new episodes of that are forthcoming.
