,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-10T04:00Z,"@krechadaninja
Bullshit.. every track on every cd works 100%.
torrenting isnt always perfect, sometimes torrents dont download properly, has happened to me plenty of times before.. just redownload the tracks you claim dont work, & i bet they work perfect.."
,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-10T04:06Z,"@zero423
its not as weak as the torrents in your list..

ya know i didnt have to upload this, & if i didnt, you'd still be waiting for the bonus cd's.. but i did out of the goodness of my fart.. yes fart.. so take a whiff & enjoy the fact that you're broke ass didnt have to pay for it.. don't whinge when your getting what you want for nothing..
"
,JerzSiam,2012-08-10T04:30Z,Shadow is this only a magnet torrent cuz I can't get it to work 
,sHaDoWeXiLe187,2012-08-10T05:41Z,"all you gotta do is click ""get torrent""
then it should give you the option to open torrent with whatever torrent program your using. such as utorrent, works best with utorrent. if nothing shows in the list, click ""choose"" then browse ya program files for the exe of whatever torrent program your using.. maybe just get utorrent if you dont have it"
