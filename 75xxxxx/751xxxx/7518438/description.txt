Synopsis: Dejan is a great Macedonian bicycling his way to France. He is traveling alone with only his bicycle and his prosthetic leg, but he knows no fear and wishes to overcome any limits by the power of his will and the pleasure of challenge. In the summer of 2009, Dejan "defeats his fears" and departs with his bicycle, from Skopje, Balkan's Macedonian heart, towards a long and lonely trip to France. For Dejan this is a big effort, a new challenge against his own limits, and a search for internal balance but also for proving that life could still be the same from before his accident, after all. That is, Dejan wears a prosthetic leg due to a banal accident that took away his feet, 4 years before, whilst working in an organic farm, in France.... However, as Dejan states, ΓÇ£Nothing can stop my desires.ΓÇ¥ He is an inspiration to others.
