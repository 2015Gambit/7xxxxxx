,ionicuji,2012-08-09T22:53Z,again thank you your the best really and truely i will trust no one else's minecraft uploads ^_^
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T23:18Z,perfect really it is just perfect thank  you again for all the hard work and thought placed into this i hope others that download it will realize that this probably took a very long time to put together
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T23:28Z,"Since this client contains a large amount of mods that can satisfy almost all, I think to approach a little differently with ""Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods V3 [FEarBG]"".

A few hours ago I wrote a list here with different mods and different packages that they will be included. Yes, but the idea of ​​""The DNS TechPack"" is much clearer. Divide on whether mods are for single or multiplayer. Who cares about tons of mods witch are only for singleplayer and you want to play online. They will not work there and the whole idea become pointless.

Because of that I decided in new client V3 to reduce the number of packages only to 2 - Single-player (SSP) and Multiplayer (SMP). Each one of them will also have Deluxe version with fancy stuff like graphics shaders and sound effects.

About the mods, I will do a little personal approach and choose the one I really like. If you do not like my choice you can always download this torrent. 

And V3 will be the end with the 1.2.5 updates and later I will continue with 1.3.1 V1, 1.3.1 V2 and so on...

P.S. If I have more time I can make and upload fully cracked Tekkit client for those who want to try it, but for now I do not promise anything..."
,ionicuji,2012-08-10T02:03Z,never heard of tekkit to be honest but like i said i will seed them all and i personally thank you because you went through alot of trouble and well i hope everyone else does the same and thank you for your hard work and effort
,eyereign,2012-08-10T03:17Z,"This is freaking awesome!  Thx FEarBG!  I didn't expect your next installment to be up and running so quick!  Quitting my job now to play!  Will comment after testing out.

And BTW the cracked Tekkit client would be a dream come true for me personally after watching scores of people doing a let's play with Tekkit...but with DNS TeckPack I think I am very (VERY) satisfied.  Kudos to you man!"
,eyereign,2012-08-10T06:34Z,"Hi FEarBG.  The minecraft instance pack (DNS_TechPack_SSP_v4.12) with Mo Creatures mod was crashing.  So I unpacked the Mo Creatures zip into the Mo Creatures folder (in the mod folder), then deleted the Mo Creatures zip (in the mod folder).  Now no crashing.  Awesome man!  Thx so much for your effort!  Will report any more crashes if come across them."
,FEarBG,2012-08-10T09:33Z,"@eyereign

With so many mods is quite possible for something to go wrong. I had the opportunity to test it fully, but I'm glad that you found the solution.

Creation of this torrent was quickly, because everything was pre-configured by ""The DNS TechPack"". All contributions go there. 

I only update Power Craft from 3.4.8 to 3.4.9 (in DNS TechPack SMP) and integrated every package in pure Minecraft client. 

I did not create the ""MultiMC"" Launcher too (if anyone thinks that is my software). The original author is Andrew Okin.

Thanks to him and ""The DNS TechPack"" team creation of this torrent was possible. I just helped a little along the way."
,FEarBG,2012-08-10T10:00Z,"P.S. BTW The ""Technic Pack"" is ready, installed and tested. Even yesterday I played a few hours with Hack/Mine. For now this package is my favorite.

I will not be home for the next two days so I will upload it when I come back around Sunday (12th).

Torrent itself will contain a complete and cracked ""Technic Pack"" with the following packs :

Technic SSP - Тhis is a singleplayer version of Tekkit. Even had more mods than Tekkit. You can see them here : http://technicpack.wikia.com/wiki/Mod_list

Tekkit - This is the most popular package, which all use to play online. 

YogBox - This is some kind of an adventure pack. Have quests and various other tasks. Mods here : http://yogbox.wikia.com/wiki/Yogbox_Wiki

The VoxelModPack - I do not remember what was this  exactly, but you can see all mods here : http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/The_VoxelModPack

Hack/Mine - Yeah, my favorite. It's something like RPG Minecraft. You can choose a different race when you start and then the type of weapon. I used a bow and he has a lot of special skills - fire arrow, lightning strike, arrow jump, Multi Arrows and so on. More info here : http://hackslashmine.wikia.com/wiki/Hack_Slash_Mine_Wiki

And finally, they have Vanilla pack witch I think it was just pure minetsraft but who knows.."
,eyereign,2012-08-10T13:44Z,Amazing FEarBG!  Be exteremly looking forward to the future releases! Have a great weekend ahead!  DNS TechPack rocks BTW!
,ionicuji,2012-08-10T17:04Z,yupyup minecraft god a.k.a FEarBG ^_^ only had one issue with dire techpack if anyone else can confirm it i'd be happy for some feed back i was messing with the elvators and minecraft crash'd on me anyone else have this problem had to uninstall and reinstall just to be able to play it again
,stormcloak,2012-08-11T21:40Z,"This is great. I'm having some issues, though. The 83 mod client keeps crashing, and the other clients are just laggy as hell. Anyone have any tips on how to solve this problem?"
,ionicuji,2012-08-11T22:11Z,i get no lag honestly with any of them you could go to the DNS home page and talk to others in there IRC channel to help hammer stuff out 
,FEarBG,2012-08-12T15:13Z,"To be honest, I think The DNS TechPack have too many mods. That way there is big chance of conflict between them and the game becomes kinda slow.

I respect the work of these people who created The DNS TeckPack, but I would not say that this package is my favorite. But still worth playing..

Anyway, I would recommend my next ""Minecraft 1.2.5 with Technic Pack [FEarBG]"" torrent. Technic 7.2 there have almost the same mods as  DNS TechPack SSP v4.11, but is much lighter and proper. And Tekkit 3.1 can replace DNS TechPack SMP.

I will shortly give a link here..

You need to register in the official minecraft website. Just register, you don't need to buy it. For more info look at the torrent description."
,GuysNick,2012-08-18T05:14Z,"Hello FEarBG, i'm part of the DNS team (if you need proof, look at the credits page on the site). I myself want to say thank you, for getting the pack out there on The Pirate Bay. Come on the IRC anytime :)   P.S.  You're awesome."
,FEarBG,2012-08-18T11:08Z,"@GuysNick

Well, one thing is certain - I did not expect such a positive response. Especially since I said that I personally prefer other technical package.

I just wrote to ""GuysNick[A]"" on the DNS IRC to confirm that this is indeed true. 

My intentions with this torrent was just to create an ultra easy way for people to play with DNS TechPack. If everything above is real I'm glad that my intentions were interpreted correctly."
,FEarBG,2012-08-21T18:59Z,"Recently I started getting a few comments under my videos about problems with mods and my torrents in general.

Since YouTube is not the most appropriate site for such discussions, nor ThePirateBay, I made a small forum where everyone can create a thread about his problem.

Please post any problems there and leave only suggestions or simple questions as comments on ThePirateBay or YouTube.
