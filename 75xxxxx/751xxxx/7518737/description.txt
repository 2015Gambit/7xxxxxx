::: Important :::

INSTALL JAVA 7 : http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

Run the game after installation and when you see a popup window that requires login information, just type only your username. I repeat, do not enter any password, just your username and then press "Play Offline". That's it.

You can play in any pirate/cracked servers with this client.
