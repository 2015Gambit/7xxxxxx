I am not responsible if you brick your phone, but if you have problems i will help however i can

If you use an overclock app like tegrak, it takes a bit for tweaks to get used to that, i overclocked with tegrak paid version to 1600 mhz, 1350 core voltage, and 267 ghz, phone rebooted halfway through stability check, tried again after reboot to settings listed above and it's stable at that now with no reboots(just fyi)

Thanks:
