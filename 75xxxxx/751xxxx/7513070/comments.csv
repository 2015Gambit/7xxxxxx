Per WIKIPEDIA for Initial Seeding( aka Super Seeding):
""Rather than claiming to have every piece from the outset, the seeder claims to have no pieces. As peers connect, the seed will inform a peer that it has received a new piece, one that has not yet been sent to any other peers. The seed then unchokes the peer and allows it to download the piece. The seed will not upload another piece to the same peer until the seed receives confirmation from other peers that the piece has been uploaded again.""

So, in effect, as you seed, so shall you receive."

The reason is this: I use 1 file as a sort of template for the description, in this case I think I used the Confidential video as a reference, now, while ALL the actual episodes are 448kb audio, the VIDEO bitrate does fluctuate from episode to episode, that's just how it goes from disc to recode,but they are all within the parameter of the posted video specs. The audio bitrate does also fluctuate according to encodes, as mentioned,all episodes are 448kb but the Confidential and.or bonus videos may be different than the posted specs,thats cause I use 'same as source' features during encoding. Anyways, enjoy!"
