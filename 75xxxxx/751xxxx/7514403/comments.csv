,marcoleetan1980,2012-08-09T01:23Z,"nikesoccer21: you may use vlc player which is available on the web by searching at google.com it plays most movie formats.
you may also use divx which is the one im using... here's is the link to download it and download the dfx for better surround sound.
these players work very well on your inquiries...
