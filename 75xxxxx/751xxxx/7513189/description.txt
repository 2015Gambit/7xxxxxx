This is the collection of K.A. Applegate books i have found by looking many places, she is a great author and i have been a huge fan of her work for some time now.


NOTES-
The original person that ripped animorphs made some mistakes that may place the top line of a page in the middle, not too difficult to sort through though, and only in the later books.

The 'megamorph' books are included by number where they would fit in the story line, therefore, the numbered books may be misnumbered, but it serves a greater good.

PLeASe seed. i have put this collection together after having a very hard time finding a torrent that had even 1 seed on it that included everything. i will seed for a very very long time, but i can't do it forever. please help.
