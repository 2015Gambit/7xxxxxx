Lorna (Gina Gershon) is a strong-willed Texas woman who's had enough of her untrustworthy husband Dale's (Val Kilmer) criminal acts and lack of husbandry. Fed up, she enlists the help of her old friend, Tiny (Kelli Giddish), to help her figure out what to do with Dale after his latest double-cross involving the theft of $100,000 from a bank.

 As the girls brainstorm for a "neat" solution, they medicate themselves with only the best of prescriptions - Tennessee whiskey - which leads them to even bigger problems. When Sheriff Cooley (Ray Liotta) inconveniently enters the conundrum, the story evolves into a tale of revenge and survival that resolves in true Texas fashion: bold and ruthless.
