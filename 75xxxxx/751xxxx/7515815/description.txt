While watching a free screening of an old Vincent Van Ghoul movie with half the
town at Crystal Cove Cemetery, the gang is attacked by the Graveyard Ghoul!
Wanting to investigate, the gang heads back to the cemetery the next day.
The first person they see is an absolutely perfect suspect, Gorak the caretaker.
He looks just like the Graveyard Ghoul and even hisses at them. But, not wanting
to commit "villain profiling," they broaden the investigation to include
the Bjorklund house on cemetery grounds.
