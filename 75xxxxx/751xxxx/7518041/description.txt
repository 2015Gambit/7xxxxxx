official ruler of the Libyan Arab 

Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then the "Brother Leader" of the Libyan Arab 

Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Gaddafi seized power in a bloodless military coup 

from King Idris in 1969 and served as the country's head of state until 1977, 

when he stepped down from his official executive role as Chairman of the 

Revolutionary Command Council of Libya and claimed subsequently to be merely a 

symbolic figurehead.[8][9] He styled himself as "Leader of the Revolution"; in 

2008 a meeting of traditional African rulers bestowed on him the title "King of 

Kings".[10] A leading advocate for a United States of Africa, he served as 

Chairperson of the African Union (AU) from 2 February 2009 to 31 January 2010.
