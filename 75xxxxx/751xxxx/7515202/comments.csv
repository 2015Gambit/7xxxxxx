Search for ""Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods V3 [FEarBG]"".

I will include absolutely all mods from this torrent, plus a few more to my taste :

- OptiFine

- SinglePlayerCommands

- NotEnoughItems

- World Downloader Mod

- ClockTime

- WorldEdit

I think everyone would agree that they are important.."

,ionicuji,2012-08-08T20:54Z,thanks again i'm sure this will work for me thank you so much words cannot truely express how greatful i am
,ionicuji,2012-08-08T20:56Z,i thank you so much for this i am very very greatful for this torrent it was way to hard for me to do on my own 
,ionicuji,2012-08-08T20:57Z,thank you very much for this for some reason its not letting me post my comments i dunno why 
,ionicuji,2012-08-08T21:10Z,i know this is going to sound gay and its cool and all but i think i got a man crush on you no homo though = but you rock if you upload any other type of torrent let me know i will seed that shit :D
,FEarBG,2012-08-08T21:15Z,"@ionicuji

Takes time before ThePirateBay to show you comment. I am glad that I I can make you happy and hopefully you will have no problems with this client. Works perfectly for me.

I think to upload a video on YouTube about how to install this torrent correctly in case someone does something wrong and this causes the problems.

Far as I know here is not possible to post direct links from YouTube, so I will use the same name as the torrent when I upload it there and you can just google search it..."
,freakyMatt_,2012-08-08T21:41Z,Does this work for multiplayer? if two persons have the same game mods?? (I know how to play with hamachi and so but i want to know if the mods work for multiplayer ;D
,FEarBG,2012-08-08T22:19Z,"@freakyMatt_

There is a difference between client mod and server mod. These here are client. If you want to play online with them you have to make server and integrate these mods there."
,FEarBG,2012-08-08T22:23Z,"Already made a video on YouTube about how to install this torrent and to show that it works properly, but unfortunately ThePirateBay does not allow me to give a direct link here.

If you want to see it you will have to search at YouTube or Google with the same name as here : Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods (Request by ionicuji) [FEarBG]"
,ionicuji,2012-08-08T23:53Z,yes it works perfectly for me and i'm very greatful for that now i can build till my hearts fill with this mod and the magnet pistons just make it so much more fun to make hide away items think i may make a house that pops up from the ground out of no where now ^_^ and its possible now thanks to you :D

,ionicuji,2012-08-09T00:27Z,run the MultiMC as admin that should fix issue give it ago ^_^
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T01:47Z,"@Thenoodleguy

""Instance started with command: C:Program FilesJavajre6binjava.exe...""

You are still using Java 6. Open MultiMC.exe inside the installation folder, go to ""Setting"", ""Advanced"" and type the new ""Java Path"" for 7 there (jre7 instead of jre6).

About the video, YouTube was not able to convert it to make it playable (it was Xvid AVI). I will make another one and upload it as soon as possible."
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T02:14Z,"Just re-upload the video. You can see the link from this picture :

,eyereign,2012-08-09T07:06Z,Just a quick question...is Equivalent Exchange a future possibility?
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T10:07Z,"@eyereign

Actually, yes..

I will also test PhysicsCraft and some other mods.

I can do 3-4 clients in the next torrent with different mods. Would be something like ""люinimum"" version, ""Normal"" and ""Full"".

And I can add another one - ""Deluxe"" or ""Ultimate"" with something like ""The DNS TECHPACK"". It contains almost all the mods from this torrent and much more. Just google it.

These are all ideas for ""Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods V3 [FEarBG]"". I do not know when it will be ready, but I will try to finish it as quickly as possible.."
,eyereign,2012-08-09T10:47Z,Thx for the reply and update FEarBG.  I certainly will be looking forward to your V3 creation.  Still enjoying this one at the moment.  No problems with it I might add!  =)

,freakyMatt_,2012-08-09T11:59Z,"@FEarBG

can you give me a premade server? with these mods installed ? please because idk how to do  it :/ :D"
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T12:44Z,"@freakyMatt_

Sorry, created a modified Bukkit server is very different than just creating client. Some mods don't have server side, others need both server and client side.. And servers need also Essentials plugins, AuthMe, Lockette, WorldGuard, Residence, PermissionsEx and a lot more. And each must be configured.

I was doing a private minecraft server project last summer with 1.8.5 and found that it takes too much time to be worth it. Also you must have very nice hardware and a lot of RAM to be able to run a proper one.

If I were you I'd wait for version 1.3.1 with Mods. There you can use LAN Play and if your friend have the same client with the same mods, they should work for both. But this is only theoretical.. I'm not sure about it .."
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T18:13Z,been trying to find a crack version of 1.2.5 to install the DNS tech pack have yet to find one doing to this to hopefully help save you some time ^_^ i'll post if i got any luck so far i keep gettting stuck at downloading updates no idea why its doing that though 
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T18:22Z,i found one that works with the DNS server but you must make sure you use the rollback app thats on the DNS teckpack site
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T18:31Z,lol nevermind i spoke to soon as soon as i went to open up my inventory it went to saving chucks and that was that lmao
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T19:01Z,"@ionicuji

Look like you have API mod there who is not integrated directly into minecraft.jar. Forge can't load those mods as ZIP archive from the ""mods"" folder.

Anyway I have working ""DNS TechPack"" client. It will be included in next torrent V3."
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T19:21Z,if you can install one with DNS techpack i think thats all anyone ever should need i am unable to do so myself as i stated before i'm stupid lol 
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T19:23Z,and as always i will countine to seed forever since you been such a big help to me and to others 
,FEarBG,2012-08-09T20:26Z,"@ionicuji

The DNS TechPack is very easy to install. I guess you do something wrong.

Here's a picture of all installed 83 mods with DNS : http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/6972/60702515.jpg

If people really want it so much then I will upload it here asap. 

Btw, ionicuji check your YouTube Inbox. I sent you a message there with an idea for a future video of the V3."
,ionicuji,2012-08-09T20:28Z,yea i would love the techpack one just to play around with some of its features if you don't mind that is
