Minecraft 1.2.5 with Mods (Request by ionicuji) [FEarBG]



::: Instalation :::

Install it wherever you want. This is completely independent Minecraft client. That way you will be able to have two (or more) clients with their own mods and they can run simultaneously without interacting with each other.



::: Important :::

Run the game after installation and when you see a popup window that requires login information, just type only your username. I repeat, do not enter any password, just your username and then press "Play Offline". That's it.

You can play in any pirate/cracked servers with this client.

- Minecraft Forge

- ModLoader 1.2.5
