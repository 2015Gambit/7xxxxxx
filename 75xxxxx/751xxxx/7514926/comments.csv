Big HUG!"
,Chris2027,2012-08-10T15:51Z,"I second what Willravel said... everything is perfect, except in that part, where at around 26 minutes, the picture freezes, but the audio continues."
,spphre91,2012-08-10T20:12Z,"Thirded to Willravel and Chris2027. Beautiful looking, and wonderful to see this made available as I'm saving up to buy the set, but the third part of the new extras is corrupt around that 26 minute mark. VLCPlayer is able to soldier on, but my settop box freaks out and ends the file. Maybe a replacement rip would be possible?"
