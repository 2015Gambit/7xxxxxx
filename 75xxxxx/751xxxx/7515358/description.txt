Vive L'Ecole [Classic 1980].avi

Madame René is the headmistress of a young ladies boarding school. Unfortunately the school is burdened with debts and the bailiff, Maître Après-Dieu *, seizes all furniture.
To help the young ladies have only one idea in order to raise funds: to prostitute themselves, of course! But as they lack experience (do they??), they need professors. Therefore Royer and Aveline are called to lend the needed experience. After some practical lessons, when the bailiff is back, he is harrassed by the schoolgirls. Finally Madame René manages to convince Maître Après-Dieu to marry her and everything ends well (with the traditional orgy)!
