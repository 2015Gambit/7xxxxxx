,Dimmis80,2012-08-07T18:48Z,Hey girl how are u doing.Always on time to give us our favorite soap.To be honest one of my 2 favorite soap.The other is Days of our lives.And i was hopping for a finale to the Liam-Hope-Stefy trio but i will have grey hair when this storie finaly comes to an end.!!lolIts very simple.Liam deserves a girl like Stefy and Stefy deserves a dude like Liam.Hope ok kinda unlucky and stuff but she must forget all about this guys and moves to better things that are truly for her.!The soap right now needs more stories.Anyways have a nice week and c u tommorow.:-)))
