P.S
For those wanting ep08 there is no official scene release out there is a version on TPB and some sites by a person called BF1. I'm sure that this is his own rip and as he is a real person ans not a bot, i will not take his work as is is already on TBP. If you want it feel free to search for it. :)

If a scene/group release becomes avalible I will post that. :)
