Description:
Jamie Gillis plays the psychotic enema bandit in this memorable porno horror. He is a sexual pervert -- an enema bandit who accosts women in their apartments, ties them up and before he rapes them gives them an enema.
Thinking about his first victim, an airline stewardess whom he has watched screwing through a telescope in his apartment, he says: "She's dirty. Just a toilet. If I cleaned her out she would be clean again. She'd thank me. She'd be glad I cleaned her out."
Warren Evans gives this nasty film a long, scary build-up with Jamie discovering that he is orgasmic when he watches an enema being given to a woman in a sex palace called Garden of Eden. Suspected by a policewoman he captures her and tortures her in a long frightening sequence. The agony of the enemas is written on his victims' faces.
"Waterpower" is a shocking stuff, but the acting is pretty good and the cinematography is great. The film is filled with gritty atmosphere of urban decay. A must-see for fans of bizarre hybrids of porn and horror.
