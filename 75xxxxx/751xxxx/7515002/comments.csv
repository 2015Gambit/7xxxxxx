[T],MrDowntown,2012-08-09T04:09Z,"I havent read this yet, the art style is bizarre but looks right for the subject matter (wonderland) - Im commenting to say the Scan quality is legit, so I dont understand the -2

If something is not SEEDING fast enough - WAIT!

The +1/-1 is for Torrent Quality!!!! Is the torrent accurate and of quality - in this case - YES!

If you dont like the torrent contents (ie you think this comic sucks) say so in the COMMENTS

Thank You"
