Towards the end of colonial India, Shahid    
Khan loots the British trains, impersonating 
the legendary Sultana Daku. Now outcast,     
Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh's  
colliery, only to spur a revenge battle that 
passes on to generations. At the turn of the 
decade, Shahid's son, the philandering Sardar
Khan vows to get his father's honor back,    
becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur.   
Staying true to its real life influences, the
film explores this revenge saga through the  
socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar   
(North India), in the coal and scrap trade   
mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of
a place obsessed with mainstream 'Bollywood'.

Notes:

Source is very very BAD.
- Blocking artifacts in almost all fast motion scenes.
- Ghostings every where.
- Pixels flying as you want and where you want.

All has been taken care of with 24 hours encode on fastest PC you can get.

Cuz I think this movie deserves spending time to correct these artifacts and give you a better viewing experience.
