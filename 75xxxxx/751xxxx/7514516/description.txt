The story is about Sunil Dhariwal (SD) aka Sonu Dilli (Emraan Hashmi), or as most people refer him to "KKC (Kutti Kameeni Cheez / Scoundrel Rascal Thing)", a street-smart, small time arms dealer in Delhi who has the gift of gab. When he is interrogated by a tough cop, ACP Pratap Raghuvanshi (Randeep Hooda), he turns informer for the latter. Although helping ACP Pratap puts Sonu in Jail for a little time, he continues to purvey the ACP with information about illegal arms racket as he has no other choice.

But when Sonu falls in love with a doctor, Jhanvi Tomar (Esha Gupta), and manages to woo her, he wants to leave the life of crime and settle down. ACP Pratap is hell bent upon finding who the leader of the arms racket is, as they were the ones who had killed his wife and made his life gloomy and miserable, persuades Sonu to continue being his informer by promising him protection and a good life afterwards. Sonu, without the knowledge of his wife, joins a bigger gang of arms traders.

Sonu, caught between the devil and the deep sea, starts playing a double game. He neither gives information to the ACP, nor tells Mangal the truth about him being a police informer. Secretly he plans to run away with Jhanvi, so that he can live a peaceful life with her. The climax unfolds into one deadly crime caper!
