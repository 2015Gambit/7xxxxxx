,nemsist221,2012-08-09T05:12Z,Thanks Nepotu! Keep up the good work. I can't watch the US men's basketball because DirectTV is a piece of shit. Thanks again and please keep uploading the US games as soon as you can. I wouldn't be watching the games if it wasn't for you.
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-09T05:22Z,"You are welcome my dear friends! 
Try this: h*t*t*p*:*/*/*w*w*w*.*r*t*v*e*.*e*s*/*l*o*n*d*r*e*s*-*2*0*1*2*/ 
-delete all * (stars). I don't know if it working for you but worth trying."

@loverbob: u r welcome!"
,ChasUGC,2012-08-09T15:23Z,"Great video for three quarters. In the 4th, I got a lot of dropped frames and ghosting again. But, the first three were perfect, and I guess that's 3 for 4, or 75%. Not a bad shooting night.;-)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-09T16:15Z,"Sorry man! This source has some kind of problems! If you don't like it, you can try another source of mine at 60fps. Cheers, mate!"
,TBHnoobie,2012-08-09T18:19Z,"it was good for first three quarters,
then when it came to the best part of the game,
thats when the video started going crazy with stutters and dropped fps.
thx for upload tho! better than nothing haha"
,ChasUGC,2012-08-09T18:19Z,"@Nepotu-Maybe you can pass the information to your source because its getting better and better. By the medal round it should be great.*fingers crossed* Really, really appreciate the effort mate.

I, maybe we, need our basketball fix during the NBA off season. It's a guy thing. lol."
,nikita566,2012-08-09T18:39Z,"Hey Nepotu,

You know I love you, man, but what the hell happened with these files? My speakers almost exploded. I had no voice, only some screeching. My wife almost had a heart attack. I saw the first three quarters on TV, so maybe it's just the fourth quarter, but man, that was painful.

For everyone else out there, Nepotu is THE MAN, best in the world. Just download a different version from his uploads.

Be cool, fools."
