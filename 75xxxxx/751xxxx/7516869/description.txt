I converted the books from text to speech using a female program voice. It's not perfect but it's pretty much how it was written; mistakes and all. This is the books from 1-5 from the Jaz Parks Series aside from the prequel, last books and mini stories in the series (Which I will convert and upload in time along with the e-books in varies formats), which was put out after the author supposedly killed herself not long after writing the last book in the series. She will be missed, regardless of how her death came to be. R.I.P. Jennifer Rardin.
