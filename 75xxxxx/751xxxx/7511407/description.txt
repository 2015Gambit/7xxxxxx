
Like Audiosurf, Symphony allows you to search your music collection in order to create a unique game experience for every song. Instead of a rollercoaster puzzle game, however, Symphony creates colorful 3D arcade shooter levels based on your musical tastes. A slow song might transform into a slow, relaxing shooter experience, while a fast electronic track with heavy beats morphs into something much more challenging.
