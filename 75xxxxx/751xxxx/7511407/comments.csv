1. You'll find ""gamelanguage.txt"" inside game folder
2. Type ""english"" or ""russian"""

,BlackEyedJester,2012-08-07T18:53Z,"Works great, seeding for atleast 75%"
,archblue1206,2012-08-07T18:54Z,thats because its inside program files..copy it to the desktop then change it there then replace the one in the program files..btw works!the game's so good..:D

,kensuke77,2012-08-08T11:42Z,"I saw it on Steam and was like ""Meh, it's probably not cracked yet, but what the hell.""  Thanks for putting this up, big ups."
,TrueW0RDS,2012-08-09T15:34Z,"-Great Upload 
-Great Game

If the gamelanguage.txt isn't allowing you to change the text... Then go to the folder properties and allow your PC profile to modify the folder."
,AdvaitDanke,2012-08-10T14:33Z,"for changing ur language u can directly delete the gamemenu.txt.so tht the language restores to default language..

BTW the game is amazing.....thanks for the great upload....."

,qrty9,2012-08-11T01:12Z,"Noticed my ship tends to ""snap to"" and ""warp"" around when I move it fast, makes fine control nearly impossible. Anyone else having this problem?"
,Bennemann,2012-08-11T02:01Z,"@qrty9 I had this issue last night, but I'm not having it today.

The mezzo-piano difficulty is not unlocking for me even though I beat the first boss. Is anyone else experiencing this?"
,Bennemann,2012-08-11T06:17Z,"Oh nevermind, I misinterpreted how it works. Each demon page actually has 3 parts, so I have to defeat the same boss twice more to mezzo-piano difficulty."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-11T06:36Z,"I just searched for this about a week ago, once I found out about it on Steam. Thanks! My wife will love this, seeing how she is a HUGE, GINORMOUS music fan and is just starting to play all kinds of games. =) By the way man, do you think you can crack Scott Pilgrim vs The World for me? I know a lot of people would play it, plus they do have the new dlc coming very soon. It includes Wallace Wells and online playability. Idk if it's a 4-way fighting online mode only or if you can actually play the Story Mode, Boss Rush Mode, Beachball Mode and Horror Survival. But that would be nice. That would be so awesome if you did man! =D I haven't seen that game up here yet, and I know for sure it's for pc."
,Bennemann,2012-08-12T07:24Z,"The ""warping"" problem described by qrty9 makes playing this game very frustrating. This has nothing to do with my hardware (core i5 2500k and GTX 560) and toning down the graphics details does not help.
Would be great if this matter was investigated and a fix released!"
,qrty9,2012-08-12T10:55Z,"@Bennemann

I was going to post on the official Steam forums to see if this is a known issue, but part of me wonders if this may be some sneaky form of DRM. Similar to how pirated Mass Effect had disabled galaxy maps, or another game (I forget which now) had a very specific level crash for unlicensed copies.

Anyone else have this problem, or found a fix?"
,Bennemann,2012-08-12T16:09Z,"@qrty9 The devs are launching betas to fix a ""stuttering"" issue. That's probably the issue we are having!"
,adambond,2012-08-16T01:53Z,Thank you for this download. It seems very good but the game keeps randomly crashing. Has anyone else had this problem? Also when it scanned my iTunes folder I noticed that it missed a bunch of songs? Has this happened to anyone else as well? 
,cyberchief100,2012-08-16T14:27Z,"Actually, most of THETA's releases have trojans. I downloaded a few games and found some viruses."
,BMO_15,2012-09-12T17:40Z,"Why when i ever open the game it says that ""This application has failed to start because MSVCR100.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem and i already re-installed it twice. PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO FIX THIS, I really want to play this game"
