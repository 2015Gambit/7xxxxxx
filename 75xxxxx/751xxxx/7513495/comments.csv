,HipHopNYC,2012-08-24T17:39Z,"These mods are outdated... :/ That's why they I uploaded them. I tried to download the 3.0 from TPB but it suspended my account for a week... If you want the 3.0 mods then don't waste your time on TPB. Most of them are fake, or get you banned...

These mods are fully legit and I have used them for over 6 months and never a problem... I do however sell the 3.0 mods now because my friend bought them from the modders and customized it for me to sell it.."
