I've tried quite a few methods...also..the tracks from the cue file appear out of order.  With 18 seeders working my guess is that I'M doing something wrong.  Please double check the files (ccbg)......try to listen to them and then reply here if you would be so kind.  I'd love to hear these."

Mine is ok! These files is in ALAC format, so may be you need a suitable program to play it such as Itunes or VLC .....
Hope that you can solve your problem."
