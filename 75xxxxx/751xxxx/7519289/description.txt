    It's 1990, Nelson Mandela is being released from prison, and 13-year-old
    John Milton has just won a cricket scholarship to a prestigious private
    school in South Africa. Nicknamed Spud because of his small size, the boy
    lives in a dysfunctional home with a senile grandmother and a father who
    thinks Mandela's release means an imminent Communist takeover. Somehow,
    Spud's not quite prepared for his new life in an elite boarding school
    full of rich kids with cool monikers like Rambo, Boggo, and Mad Dog.
    Bullied by two older boys, Spud seeks solace in the school's production
    of Oliver! He wins the lead role-and the hearts of both Mermaid and
    seductive Amanda. Luckily, Spud can always get advice from his friend
    Gecko; his hero, the head of house Luthuli; and his eccentric, alcoholic
    English teacher, The Guv. Based on the popular comic novel by John van
    de Ruit, Spud marks the welcome return of John Cleese as The Guv, while
    Troye Sivan (young Logan in X-Men: Wolverine) is perfectly cast as Spud.

    This affectionate, sometimes embarrassing, and oft-hilarious coming-of-age
    story opens the viewers' eyes to strange worlds, first love, and true 
    friendship. ...Spud
