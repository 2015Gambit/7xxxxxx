Now outcast, Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh`s colliery, only to spur a battle that passes on to generations. At the turn of the decade, Shahid`s son, the philandering Sardar Khan vows to get his father`s honor back, becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur.Staying true to its real life influences, the film explores this revenge saga through the socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar, in the coal and scrap trade mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of a place obsessed with mainstream `Bollywood` cinema.
