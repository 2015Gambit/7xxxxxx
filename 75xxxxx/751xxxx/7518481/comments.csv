,jersson,2012-08-10T00:02Z,Can I use the activator on the standard free real player that I have installed or do I have to install this one first ?
,pezhvak,2012-08-10T16:51Z,How can I open this file? Windows 7 does not recognize it! Thanks.

,signman1,2012-09-02T16:16Z,"WHoa....how do you get this activator to work with Win7 Pro x64?? It wont let you move the file to the destination folder nor will it run even as ""Run as Admistrator"". Keep  getting ""Can't access file, you need admin rights....???"
,Bmassive92,2012-09-03T03:03Z,@pezhvak you may need to download winrar to extract files
,RicardoMadMan,2012-09-04T13:09Z,"It would be a excelent upload, unfortunely, the activator doesn't work...
I've tried to install it both online and offline, and when i ran the patcher, the result was always ""access file error"" - ""0 of 20 files patched"""
,Stonerg,2012-09-05T07:48Z,RicardoMadMan is right the activator dont work.
