Originally airing on HBO, this powerful documentary examines the legacy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States during World War II. Along with compelling interviews with survivors and Americans who were involved in carrying out the attacks, you'll discover how the bombings forever changed the face of warfare.

I'm sharing this for Hiroshima Day. War is evil. Don't do it.
