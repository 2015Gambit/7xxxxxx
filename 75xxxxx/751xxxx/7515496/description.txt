Notes:
We got some nice vobs for this one, but they had their weaknesses, top left corner perspective was off, tried pulling it out and correcting it but to no avail lol, the ar changes throughout but only slightly so you will see black bars and barely notice it, its no big deal i didnt want to overcrop it  anyways onto the filtering .... denoised, yuv, hue, sat, chroma, levels, contrast, resize and sharpen. 

Audio is nice line synced, cleaned and muxed.

Enjoy another UNiQUE release.......
