Description:
HyperBlade introduces the 3D battlesport of the future. Players engage in a futuristic street-hockey style game played out in the interior of an elongated ellipsoid arena. Body-checks go for blood in this game as players can be gruesomely eliminated. Power-ups, speed boosts, ramps, and simple team management are all part of the experience. Some strategy is required for play, but it's mostly pure action. The game also features multiple skill levels, 12 teams, and head-to-head network play.
