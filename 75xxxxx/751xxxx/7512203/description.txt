Our lives are all affected by three hugely powerful and well financed, but undemocratic, organizations: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. These institutions share a common ideology. They aggressively promote "corporate" capitalism, neoliberalism, giving free rein to the interests of a small number of transnational corporations. This book presents the history and fundamental ideas of this economic ideology. Describing each member of the "unholy trinity," it shows how neoliberalism hijacked the IMF, World Bank and WTO in relation to their global financial, development and trade management roles.
