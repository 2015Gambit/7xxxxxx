,PhantomSteror,2012-08-16T12:04Z,"Didn't really see any misspelled stuff so I just put them there and I didn't replace any files that were already there and it worked, I'm going to try out playing this on multiplayer with my friend but so far I did about 8 missions in the campaign and everything  worked, so it looks good."
