,strikeseven,2012-08-08T21:02Z,"Hey whorepig how are you able to rip the videos from teennick (can you tell me)? I've tried everything and nothing works :/

Or are you just using screencap software?"
,pg167,2012-08-08T21:33Z,"hey, thanks, but do you have episode 13 or 14 ? if you have can you post, please :)"
,strikeseven,2012-08-08T22:26Z,"Nevermind, I figured out how to rip the videos myself, can't believe I couldn't figure it out before.

Thanks a lot whorepig for the uploads.

Hopefully I'll be contributing soon, I'll be downloading from TPB a lot less now! m/"
,yurune,2012-08-08T23:08Z,"Those are are my files, lol.  You removed my tag from the filename, are you trying to take credit for my work, whorepig?"
,yurune,2012-08-08T23:44Z,I will be ripping & uploading the next episodes.  Go to livingonvideo-tv(.)blogspot(.)com
,JoePhiles,2012-08-09T00:07Z,"Yurune, you sound like the MPAA or RIAA, You don't own anything you share. Get over your ego!
Tags or groups have no place in sharing."
,whorepig,2012-08-09T01:57Z,"sorry yurune, wasn't trying to take credit so much as shorten the very long filename...was just trying to share the goodness! apologies if I offended."
,mightythankful,2012-08-09T02:59Z,"Thanks for the upload! Keep em coming ;)

,amanda10,2012-08-09T12:17Z,THANK YOU!! This made my night :D.
,yurune,2012-08-09T14:24Z,"I'm glad everyone is enjoying my rips/uploads, so you're welcome!  Hopefully people snatching them from my blog and uploading them here will give me credit next time."
,JoePhiles,2012-08-10T01:39Z,"shutup assnozzle, or I'll strip your name off every file and up them to every major torrent site.

You douchebag!

YOU DON'T OWN Degrassi content!"
,JoePhiles,2012-08-10T01:43Z,"Yurune makes money off piracy by getting a commission on filelocker downloads.

This hypocrite has back years of Degrassi files that others ripped, and HE put his site name on them.

Hypocrite assh0le!

"
,yurune,2012-08-10T10:13Z,"I get literally just a few pennies from spending HOURS and hours ripping and uploading tv shows that people ask me to upload for them, so I'm hardly in this for the money.

I am not a hypocrite.  I personally ripped Degrassi seasons 5 thru 10 from my own DVDs, that's why they have my name on them.  2hd ripped season 11, so they do NOT have my name on them.

I never said I owned Degrassi content.  Most people are appreciative of what I do, but feel free not to download them if you disagree."
