This is a multi-threaded multi-pool GPU, FPGA and CPU miner with ATI GPU
monitoring, (over)clocking and fanspeed support for bitcoin and derivative
coins. Do not use on multiple block chains at the same time!

This code is provided entirely free of charge by the programmer in his spare
time so donations would be greatly appreciated. Please consider donating to the
