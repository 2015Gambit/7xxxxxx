,japrage_s,2012-08-08T21:41Z,"I'm gonna call this bluff and raise with a FAKE.

User reported too. This isn't meant for windows 8 rtm 9200."
,bry68,2012-08-08T22:37Z,hey japrage r u sure? hes got a pink skull?
,japrage_s,2012-08-08T23:57Z,"windows 8 build 7850 as said in the torrent.
its for beta product

final windows 8 is 9200 rtm. it dosnt work on rtm."
,botakal,2012-08-09T07:56Z,"ok, this is useless. Why do we use a beta product when the final version has been released. We just have to wait the ""Windows Loader"" for 8. "
,gozando,2012-08-09T11:50Z,"Not Fake, just an older activator  but this torrent is just what it says, so look also that pinky skully, means trusted"
,gozando,2012-08-09T11:57Z,"@japrage_s    STOP WHINING DUDE !!! you are the bluff and raise and stop bitchin , or go buy the real deal,  re-read your comment and read the main title of this torrent, so shut the hell up,,what you post here ? nothing right ? so stop whining"
,japrage_s,2012-08-09T17:30Z,"gozanda, u crazy"
,techme21,2012-08-09T23:14Z,"I made a simple batch file that will connect to all three known kms servers
and attempt activation with them automatically
It does all commands silently so you don't have all of those annoying popups from every attempt
and it will loop infinitely
My goal is to make it stop Automatically when An activation server has been reached,
And Echo Windows Successfully!
Just paste the below code into a notepad and save as Activate.bat to C:    root directory
Then make a shortcut to that file on your desktop.
Then right click the shortcut and go to ""Properties""
Then go to the Shortcut Tab
Then click advanced
Then check the ""Run as Administrator"" box
Hit OK and OK again
Now run it

Maybe this could be a base idea for a Windows based KMS Activation Program
Then you could add the option of adding your own KMS server.

Here's what I got so far


[CODE]
@Echo Off

Echo Attempting Windows Activation
Echo Please Wait...

cscript //B ""%windir%system32slmgr.vbs"" /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688

Echo Activation will Retry in 10 Seconds

It will just keep trying until it does work."
