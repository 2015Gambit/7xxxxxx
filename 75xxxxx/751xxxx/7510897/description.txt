"The Messenger"

When a young man in a cult claims to be 
hearing the word of God, Pierce must 
determine if its actually the word of 
God or a life-threatening neurological 
condition. Pierce and Moretti must also 
figure out if his murder is linked to his 
drug past or his new life with an 
organization that may be scamming people 
out of their life savings. Roger Bart 
guest-stars as Ethan Kendrick, a high-
powered IRS agent looking into the 
finances of the organization. Meanwhile, 
the university gives Pierce an award for 
his research.
