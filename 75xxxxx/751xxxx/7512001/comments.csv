He will never finish his torrents, even if you see a few seeders.
Try to check his uploads - they all show zero or a few seeders and more than 100 leechers, which is not normal.
He just want you to check his screenshot, so he can get some $ 
DO NOT click on the image link! "
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-08-08T05:33Z,"@janesteve:  OK, it has been about 24 hours since you posted this torrent.  It is now only 6.3% complete, or 41 MB.

At this uploading rate, it means you will have to seed it for at least 22 days in order for it to complete. 

22 days!!!!  You said already that you seed for 3 days only.  That means I will get a total of only 120 MB out of the 887 MB in this post before you stop seeding.  And that means that I (and everyone else) will never be able to complete this post.

Are you going to do that?  Or are you going to continue to be an asshole who claims to be seeding when in fact you don't care at all whether anyone can get the files you post?"
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-08-11T02:27Z,I can confirm that this one was seeded to completion.  Let's hope the poster has learned how to seed and that the rest of his posts will also complete.
