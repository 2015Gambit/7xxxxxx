,Arcossi,2012-08-09T19:28Z,Anyone gets a virus reported in the attached rar-file? Kaspersky found a Trojan Dropper Win.32 Dapato Bona. Any Help??
,SuperAndrew78,2012-08-09T19:36Z,"Arcossi, Kaspersky being notoriously overprotective. You can't get a virus from a picture - just ignore it. Scan the archive with Anubisscan if you don't trust me, it will show you everything it does."
,RL269,2012-08-09T22:18Z,"If there is a 'folder' nearby it could be a shortcut that can be set to run the jpeg. You can't get a virus from a picture that's being used as a picture, you can get a virus from a virus file that has been given a false file type and the run."
,RL269,2012-08-10T01:10Z,"There is a virus hidden as a picture. If you see something that looks like a folder but has an arrow on it right-click and check the properties, if you see the words 'cmd exe' followed by a file name, delete both the folder and the picture named."
