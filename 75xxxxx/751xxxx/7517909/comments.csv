,Mr.Lucifero,2012-09-16T07:56Z,"Hey 20-40, this is a very nice HD rip man....Sharp & clear with nice tonality. Black is black & white is white....Beautiful....Anyway, here's my rating criteria...I only give out video rating of 9 & 10 for Blu-ray like quality or HD like quality and 8 & 8.5 for DVD like quality. I don't rate the audio unless it's either really bad or really good. ...This nice HD RIP gets a very strong rating of 8.5 or possibly a 9 from me. Very much like top of the line DVD quality & almost like Real HD quality to me!! This is an astonishing result considering the fact that this is a very small size HD Rip.....Thanks 20-40 & keep up the good work man..... 8)"
