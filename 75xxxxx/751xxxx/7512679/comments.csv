,opaleg,2012-08-08T03:39Z,"The first ten minute or so has good english.. after that for some reason it turns into a hilariously BAD translation... I'm talking almost gibberish!

Pathologic has a better translation than this! I am serious! And that game has a notoriously awkward english translation.. but even that game reads better and is infinitely better with gameplay."

Yes the game is terrible. It LOOKS amazing, the graphics are surprisingly good and the lighting is great. But the translation is so bad it alone condemns the game. I'm serious, it's actually worse than I can say.

Setting that aside though it's very clunky. Give it a try, you may end up liking it. Pathologic was another badly translated game that was dated but I ended up loving it.

If you have some bandwidth free you don't know what to do with give it a try. I mostly don't listen to other people. Sometimes I regret it lol"
