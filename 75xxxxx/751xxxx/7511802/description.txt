The Very Best of Indie Alternative Rock Playlists- First Half 2012
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a collection of The Very Best in Indie, Alternative & Rock music taken from various playlists posted on the internet for The First Half Of 2012 (Jan-Jun).

Thanks to Criznittle, BIRP, Cut The Crap, Shankly, and Dakradha and Samy (Snipe the Hype) among others (I added a couple of tunes too) for their contributions. 



I have taken the various songs released by the contributors, and put them in a big musical blender-what came out is a 'super compilation' made from all their playlists. I am just the editor....they are the producers.  


Thanks to everyone who took a few seconds to leave me comments last time.  I'm glad you enjoyed the playlists, and hopefully this batch will add to your digital music collections. 
 
Hope you Enjoy,

Be Cool To Others...seed for a while, they did for you.
