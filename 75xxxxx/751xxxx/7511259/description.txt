Crystal Cove welcomes artist Randy Warsaw, who presents his latest work in the Art Museum, entitled "Junk." However, this latest work comes to life and attacks patrons of the museum, swallowing members of Warsaw's entourage and working staff and turning them into gold statues. The gang is asked by Mayor Nettles to solve the mystery so the Art Museum can be saved, but this becomes easier said than done as the gang are employed as part of Warsaw's exhibit, leaving Daphne to work the case alone. After solving the case, Mystery Inc. receive a radio broadcast from Cassidy Williams warning them of evil in Crystal Cove.
