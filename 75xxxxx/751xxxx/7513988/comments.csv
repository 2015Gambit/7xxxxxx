[T],SecTPB,2012-08-14T11:54Z,"Whoever downsized the BluRay source with such a low bitrate has defeated the entire purpose of this movie being released in BluRay to begin with.

Encode at a much higher bitrate in 1080p please if you're going to upload at all. The HDTV Rip quality is better than this version, guys. Skip it and wait for a proper encode.

Unless someone's kind enough to give me the BluRay disc source files, then I'll happily encode this to perfection ;)
