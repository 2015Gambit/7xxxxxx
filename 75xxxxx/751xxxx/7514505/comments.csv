How come no one will block this jenkey1002 in every file that he upload is Trojan horse virus. Why no one post any virus scans why this guy is still allowed to post this virused crap? I wish I could have unlocked time of gameplay from 5 mins to 15 but I don't want to download another virused file from jenkey while every antyvirus shows that it's trojan horse inside."

Perhaps because it isn't a virus - but a so called false positive - you asshat?"
