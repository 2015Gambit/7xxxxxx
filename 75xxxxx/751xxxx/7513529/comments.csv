,tgrphnx,2012-08-08T05:35Z,"ironic of you to say much of this.  This isn't in rar format. You might want to check your downloading settings as I can see AND connect to these seeds and peers.  Never had a problem with sceneline (not on of my favs though as I usually get eztv or ettv but they don't release certain types of shows) Almost never the first to release?  This IS the first release of this show.  eztv and ettv don't do cartoons (most of the time).

TLDR= Thank you sceneline.  you may not be the best out there but I appreciate your work."
,tgrphnx,2012-08-08T05:39Z,"My apologies, yes this one is rar'd. Which is sucky but is really no different (despite what previous ""ranter"" states) then downloading the parts all together.  just takes a few seconds put put them back together.  Get a comp that isn't running a pentium III and it'll only take a min or two to deRAR them."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-08-08T13:18Z,"@:tgrphnx The point is it should not be up to everyone who downloads a file to have  to unrar the file hundreds or even thousands of times instead of once b-4 uploading. I could show you hundreds of torrents from sceneline that never finish and because they are rared even at 99% complete there is no way to play the file. There is no reason at all in this day and age to rar a  release. I totally agree with what dascratch states in his comment. Just because you have a green skull and are a group, it does not mean that all your releases are great."
,Sheldon131,2012-08-08T16:09Z,Why in the hell they put them in .rar format?!
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-08-09T02:15Z,The original comment (The First comment in this post) from dascratch  seems to some how have been removed as if someone did not like what was said.
,tgrphnx,2012-08-10T04:04Z,"@thetorrentlord: I agree that it being in rar format is crappy.  I never stated otherwise, but his no one forced him to download this torrent (which, I have a feeling he didn't do) so there really is no good reason to go on the kind of rant he went to. The download is fine, he should have been a little grateful as it was the only one for a short bit."
,BoonesFerry,2012-08-14T03:41Z,Complaining about the flavor of FREE stuff served to you by unpaid hobbyists and enthusiasts is rather asinine. If you dont like the offering then move along without spewing your bullshit.
,Froglet,2012-08-18T14:07Z,"Thanks dudes. Now my only problem is do I watch it on the train tomorrow or wait a week until my daughter gets back from Switzerland. Decisions, all the time decisions."
,gdogfolife,2012-08-27T07:56Z,the only problem i have with rar files is that i dont know which format the video is in. it could be avi or mkv so its a gamble on what player ill use in the end. *sigh* first world problems
