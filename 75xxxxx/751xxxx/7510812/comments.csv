The series use to be pretty good, but now its just an excuse of a bad series. They are starting to act bad and the special effects are pretty bad, many times you see that a whole scene is just generated on computer. I liked this series but I have lost interest, sadly."

,TreeBean,2012-08-08T06:22Z,I feel the show is going down too.

There for awhile the Pete/Myka interactions were priceless. (Huge Myka crush, hnngh) But it seems since the end of the Sykes story arc it's kind of meh'd out. Hopefully it'll pick back up and whichever writers were responsible for late S2's and S3's near perfection will get the reigns again."
