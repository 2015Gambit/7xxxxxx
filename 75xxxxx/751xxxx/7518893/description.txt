Terry Jones History Collection
 Three "History" documentaries from 2002-3: The Surprising History of Sex and Love, The Hidden History of Egypt, and The Hidden History of Rome. Even though these docs are a little old, the historical record hasn't changed much since then, so they're not made up of stale info. Terry Jones has definitely put a unique spin on the historical documentary in the past decade. While Medieval Lives and Barbarians are still the best of his work, these somewhat-hard-to-find documentaries are also quality additions to his canon. They are well worth a look for fans of Jones' historical adventures.


1)  Surprising History of Sex and Love 
Exploring the radical change in social and religious attitudes towards sex, this award-winning documentary takes a look throughout history and traces the shift in social attitudes and practices. Terry traces an unexpected route of how sex got from strict social repression to the full-frontal glossies of today.

2)  Hidden History of Egypt 
Bringing to life the everyday details of the ancients Egyptians - bizarre, hilarious or shocking - this wonderfully entertaining and factually revealing film is packed full of surprises. With Jones throwing informed yet sometimes crazed light on the subject, a previously hidden world of the ancient Egyptians is wonderfully brought to life.

3)  Hidden History of Rome 
Who better to scrutinise and investigate the quirkier achievements of the impressive and expansive Roman Empire than co-creator of the brilliantly accomplished question; 'What have the Romans ever done for us'? Terry Jones is in search of an answer. Unearthing the secrets of the Roman world in his own idiosyncratic and bizarre way, he reveals how ordinary people really lived in ancient Rome.
