Description:
Drake of the 99 Dragons (also titled Drake) is a cel-shaded third person shooter video game. The clan of the 99 Dragons has been wiped out and the artifact they had been guarding has fallen into the wrong hands. One of the clan members, Drake, is brought back from the dead to avenge his clan and recover the lost treasure. This stylistic adventure offers a world no longer limited by the trappings of humanity. Drake now has the power to run up walls and perform backflips, somersault over furniture, and whip out dual pistols to enact the only form of justice that can satisfy his lust for vengeance. Draped in a black trench coat, the title character must travel across Neo Tokyo's dark indoor and outdoor locales while confronting enemy thugs, avoiding searchlights, and finding helpful pickups along the way.
