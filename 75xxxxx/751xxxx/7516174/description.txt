The central theme of Introduction to Electric Circuits is the concept that electric circuits are a part of the basic fabric of modern technology. Given this theme, this book endeavors to show how the analysis and design of electric circuits are inseparably intertwined with the ability of the engineer to design complex electronic, communication, computer and control systems as well as consumer products.This book is designed for a one-to three-term course in electric circuits or linear circuit analysis, and is structured for maximum flexibility.
