,gnomad,2012-08-09T21:49Z,"Thanks for the up, but the scan quality is terrible!"
,brazerok,2012-08-11T09:55Z,"Yeah, apologies for the scan quality; it's probably the worst I've ever produced. While I think the text is readable, some subscripts are blurry."
,mlech,2012-08-24T05:13Z,Many profuse thanks!
,Lixler,2012-09-17T19:38Z,"Am I wrong, or are there no problems? 

If so, this is hardly useful."
,Lixler,2012-09-17T19:47Z,"Correction: I'm wrong, problems are there."
