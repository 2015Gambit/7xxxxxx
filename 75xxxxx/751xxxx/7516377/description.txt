The Lost Audition Show (33:05) - This episode was filmed on a 16mm Kinescope as an audition show and was never broadcast. It comes from the Nat Hiken Collection at the Wisconsin Center for Film & Theater Research. This rarely seen live show was previously included on the 50th Anniversary Edition release. It's in pretty poor shape compared to the regular episodes. There is lots of dirt, debris, scratches and other video problems. It is certainly watchable. It will just make you appreciate how much better the regular episodes look. This show follows the "New Recruits" episode plot pretty closely, but there are a few additional scenes. It doesn't have Allan Melvin or Paul Ford in it. Jack Warden plays Cpl. Henshaw. There is a vintage CBS Television Network logo at the end.
