Comments:

Picked this up from a record store in Chappaqua,NY in 1995 or so.
An overall stale show from this tour.
Probably sourced from video. 
Not the complete show.

The complete show was recorded on film by Godley and Creme. It was planned to 
release this show on home video, but only shots of the public of this show were 
used for the official video (Synchronicity Concert) recorded in Atlanta.
Parts of the Montreal show were shown on TV in Canada (at "First Choice Rocks" 
on 31-12-1983), France and Japan.

Backing vocals by Tessa Niles, Ray Schell and Sandy Owens.
