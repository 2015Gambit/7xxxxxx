Learn from Dice!"
,faaaaq,2012-08-09T19:01Z,"Everyone?  Im like, halfway thru the game and I got the game before release day...  Not ""everyone"" can sit around all day and play video games.  Also, this DLC is bs, it only gave me ONE of the weapons."
,a0l4ni,2012-08-09T19:17Z,I have 1.03 version and I canÂ´t find the new weapons ingame.
,Pakundo,2012-08-09T19:31Z,"Copied over the content in the right folders, resumed a save...
And nope, no new guns ANYWHERE.
Not even in stores."
,Pakundo,2012-08-09T19:34Z,"The files of the DLC are here, but something's missing.
Something that allows the game to use the DLC files, maybe?"
,Sinio1988,2012-08-09T19:39Z,not working
,Adam_21,2012-08-09T20:18Z,"game is asking to log into EA account associated with DLC. refuses to verify it otherwise. any way to circumvent it without logging into Origin?  (I have an uncracked, registered copy of the game)"
,Pirat47,2012-08-09T21:03Z,@faaak The game was released almost half a year ago! I don't play games all day. I played it even more rarely than other games to cherish the moment and finished after a month.
,The4X3R,2012-08-10T05:22Z,I think DLC Unlocker required
,Serpent360,2012-08-10T16:02Z,"It's missing updated Coalesced.bin file. Withou it, it will not work"

,dondamov123,2012-08-17T20:14Z,"Once i go into the spectre terminal to purchase the weapons, there seems to be 2 blank slots there, only displaying the cost, and even when you purchase them, nothing happens.

Also there only seems to be 6 / 7 of the weapons that are suppose to be there."
,Fantomnz,2012-08-18T09:00Z,"Hi All :)

Iv done some checking & from what I can tell the 2-blank spots are weapons from the Multi player resurgance DLC.

I could be wrong so if anybody knows the info would be appreciated :) Thanks.
