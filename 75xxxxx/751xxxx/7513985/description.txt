USB Write Protect is a tiny but very handy tool that can enable write protection on all USB flash pens and thus prevent your data from being modified or deleted.

Although it may sound very useful indeed, it's not so revolutionary because protection is only enabled on the computer you used to turn the feature on, so you won't get a permanent protection on all machines.

Still, USB Write Protect could come in very handy if you wish to avoid those embarrassing moments when you accidentally remove personal data.

Enabling Write Protect on a given USB flash pen is easy as pie. Plug the device into an USB port, wait a few seconds until it's being displayed in the USB Storage Devices list, check the ΓÇ£Enable Write ProtectΓÇ¥ option and hit the Apply button.

Close the application and that's it. Windows 7 users will have to unplug the device and then plug it back again in order to fully enable Write Protection, otherwise they won't see any major modification.

Although there's no help file included in the application, the main window comprises all the information you will ever need when working with USB Write Protect, including detailed explanations of every section.

Once you're done with Write Protect and you wish to disable it, there's an option for this as well, so you just have to reopen the application and choose the dedicated tool.

Of course, the application runs on all Windows versions out there without hampering computer performance at all, which means it can be safely used on older machines too.

All things considered, USB Write Protection could prove to be very useful if you wish to avoid deleting your data accidentally, but don't expect it to do wonders. It's still worth a chance though.
