 The Briefs is a documentary series which looks at the world of criminal law. The 
 series has been given unprecedented access to Britain's busiest legal aid 
 practice, as it follows the solicitors at Tuckers in Manchester, as they look 
 after their clients on cases ranging from blackmail to murder.
