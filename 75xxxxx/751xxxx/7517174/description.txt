EAC was used to rip audio from the following albums:

 * 2000 - LemonJelly.ky
 * 2002 - Lost Horizons
 * 2005 - '64-'95

Encoded as high quality VBR MP3. Please see the comments for a link to the FLAC version.

I couldn't find high quality versions of these anywhere, so I bought the CD's and made my own.
Enjoy, and please seed.
