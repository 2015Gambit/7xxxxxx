Episode 10 : SAS Mission Impossible 

As six British soldiers sat imprisoned in a hut in the jungles of Sierra Leone, their captors - a heavily-armed militia group known as the West Side Boys - were mostly asleep. But unknown to either group, the SAS were about to engage in one of the boldest rescue missions in modern history. They were flown deep into the jungle of Sierra Leone in an attempt to release the hostages who had been held for more than two weeks.

What happened as the rescue attempt unfolded has always been a closely guarded secret. Now the story of this SAS mission and the terrible days of captivity endured by the hostages is told for the first time by the people who were there. For one of the hostages it is a story of survival in a living hell.
