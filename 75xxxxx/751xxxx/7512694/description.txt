Plot: When David Lindholm, Sweden’s most famous police officer is found shot dead in bed, Annika Bengtzon quickly identifies the crime with his young wife, Julia. She is threatened with life imprisonment for murdering both, her husband and her missing four year old son, Alexander. But Julia refuses to confess and maintains her innocence. She claims another woman shot her husband and kidnapped her son. While life collapses around Annika, she digs deeper and deeper into the murdered policeman’s violent past. Finally, there are only two fundamental questions remaining. If Julia is lying: Where has she hidden Alexander? If she speaks the truth: Who keeps the boy captive?
