Oxy Morons review Director Johnny Hickey takes the helm for this semi-autobiographical crime drama centering on a fractured Charlestown family torn violently apart by the emerging Oxycontin
trade. Oxy Morons DVD Jason and Danny were mere children when their father, a notorious bank robber, was killed in cold blood. Years later, when their ailing mother is prescribed a powerful new pain-killer known as Oxtcontin, the Hickey brothers see a potential for major profit. Before long Jason and Danny have become the two biggest players in Boston's burgeoning Oxycontin black market. Now the more powerful they become, the greater their chances of being targeted by the police, or rival drug dealers seeking a piece of the profit.
This is the only Johnny Hickey video...
