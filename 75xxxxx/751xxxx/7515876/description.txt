Time's Tapestry is a four-volume alternate history and science fiction series by British author Stephen Baxter. The four novels are Emperor, Conqueror, Navigator, and Weaver.
The narrative begins in 4 BC and ends in 1943 (in a different timeline than our own).
In short, the science-fiction premise of this alternate-history epic is that our timeline today, i.e., history as we know it, is the result of a series of interventions from an alternate future into its past, the last of which occurs as the story ends, resulting in our own timeline.
