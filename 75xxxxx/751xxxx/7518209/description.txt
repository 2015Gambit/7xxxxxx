Dagenais 2012 Evidence Based Management of Low Back Pain

The concept for this textbook was initially proposed in 2006 by the North American Spine Society (NASS), one of the largest associations of health professionals involved in caring for patients with spine conditions. NASS has more than 5000
members in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and around the world. Its members include primary care physicians, medical specialists, spine surgeons, chiropractors, physical therapists, nurses, physician assistants, researchers, policy makers, among many others. Although they come from varied backgrounds, members of NASS all share a common interest of wanting to improve spinal health.

NASSΓÇÖs scientific publication, The Spine Journal, was created in 2001 to provide its members and others in the scientific and health care communities with a medium to share important scientific discoveries, disseminate study results, and discuss important concepts and opinions related to the management of spinal conditions. Although most of its members are spine surgeons, NASS recognizes the importance
of a multidisciplinary approach to spine care. The Spine Journal has always attempted to include a variety of articles related to all aspects of caring for patients with both common and rare spine conditions that may be of interest to its readers.

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for consulting with primary care, specialty care, and allied health professionals involved in the management of spinal conditions. The number of treatment approaches available for the management of LBP has grown rapidly in recent decades following advances in surgical techniques, discoveries of new medications, and focused interventions developed in response to a greater understanding of the etiology of LBP. This constant growth in the number of available treatments has made it challenging for those involved in the management of LBP to select among these myriad options.
