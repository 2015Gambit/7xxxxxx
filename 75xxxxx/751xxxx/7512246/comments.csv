WORKDONE:

First off readnfo .....basically to tell ya the video is pretty poo and is missing a few mins :(

The was a low res crap mpeg file,so first off we needed too crop borders ...upscale the max we could 
then clean it up.
Audio was some nice line ....and thought what the hell we'll sync it anyway,gives users a little taste of
what th film is like :)
Pita to sync aswell ...but we got there in the end.

,Neraforesta,2012-08-08T01:58Z,"Harry Kim needs an A/V for his comments. I rate em 0/0 or rather, a big fat stink shit...you should die for such insolence."
,Reyter2007,2012-08-08T08:34Z,"Overall A7 V3. For a Cam, A9 V5. Unless you are really desperate I suggest waiting for a better copy. "
