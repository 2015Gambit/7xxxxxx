ATTENTION DANGER, don't blame me if anything bad happens to your computer.



Hello, I just found this and I don't want to try it because I don't want to mess with my official licence for Element 3D.

Can anybody try it and tell me if it works? You probably need to copy the dll file to your windows folder.

I checked it with AVG and there are no viruses.

Here the link to the "autor". In my torrent the missing DLL is already included.
