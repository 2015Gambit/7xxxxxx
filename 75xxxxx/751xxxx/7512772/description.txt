GamesRadarΓÇÖs weekly interwebshow is a tasty stew of drunkenness, cursing, inappropriate sound effects, hilarious audio clips, special guests, contests, interviews with people too important to be on our show, compromising personal stories, and, oh yeah, videogames. The editors of GamesRadar US converge every week over booze and buffoonery for a spirited arguescussion on gaming culture, news, reviews, deals, industry b******t, and general miscellanea. If youΓÇÖd rather hear two hours of dry discourse, look elsewhere.
