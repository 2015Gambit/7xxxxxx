Notes:
I've had this matrix in the can for over two years, but I was waiting
to do the the whole run before releasing it.  There seemed to be some
desire to have the PCM source of the SBD used for the matrix, so here
it is.  Both sources are digital making the synching rather easy.  I
removed a few baloon pops in the AUD.  Light Waves L2 was used for 
limiting (-0.7 threshold), and no EQ or other processing was employed.

One of the favorite shows I attended - the crowd freaked on the
Hey Jude rezi.  Loser - Dupree's, and Shakedown -> Fingers were great
Jerry suites.

Thanks to Charlie Miller for the PCM source on the SBD, and to Doug and
Jim Oade for recording the AUD - a great combination!

Enjoy!
