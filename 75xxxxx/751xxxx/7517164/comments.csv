,techme21,2012-08-09T23:09Z,"I made a simple batch file that will connect to all three known kms servers
and attempt activation with them automatically
It does all commands silently so you don't have all of those annoying popups from every attempt
and it will loop infinitely
My goal is to make it stop Automatically when An activation server has been reached,
And Echo Windows Successfully!
Just paste the below code into a notepad and save as Activate.bat to C:    root directory
Then make a shortcut to that file on your desktop.
Then right click the shortcut and go to ""Properties""
Then go to the Shortcut Tab
Then click advanced
Then check the ""Run as Administrator"" box
Hit OK and OK again
Now run it

Maybe this could be a base idea for a Windows based KMS Activation Program
Then you could add the option of adding your own KMS server.

Here's what I got so far


[CODE]
@Echo Off

Echo Attempting Windows Activation
Echo Please Wait...

cscript //B ""%windir%system32slmgr.vbs"" /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
cscript //B ""%windir%system32slmgr.vbs"" /ato

,techme21,2012-08-09T23:16Z,"P.S. If the servers are down then my above script will not work.
It will just keep trying until it does work."
,Thrakazog58,2012-08-15T21:20Z,"@techme21 Love the script and am trying it out now. Thanks for putting it together :) 

One question: I don't see an end condition. How will the script know when to stop looping?
"
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-26T09:45Z,microsoft is seriously winning at this time over piracy. this so-called KMS Automated Activator isn't come as far as standalone KMS like used to be KMS for OFFICE2010 and WINDOWS 7 enterprise. this is just a method of contacting kms server online.
