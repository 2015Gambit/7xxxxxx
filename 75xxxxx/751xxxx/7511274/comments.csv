,brown_turd,2012-08-07T22:40Z,"@000rich - the uploader Nepotu is busy enough just trying to get his hands on all these games for us.  Asking him to spoon feed you a certain format of the game is a slap in the face.  Why should he have to spend 2 hrs converting this huge file into .flv just because it's easier for you??  The rest of us don't want the game in a cruddy .flv file.  FLV is an Adobe thing & is mainly used for online streaming and embedding media into web pages, and anyone trying to utilize HD will not be able to as H.264 and AAC compression formats in the FLV file format has some limitations.. that's why Adobe is implementing F4V format that will bring FLV files out of their streaming nature and make them more useable for HD media players & clients.  We're lucky enough to have this source.  So bite the bullet, and download this source, then you can do whatever your little heart desires with it.  Just get a program to convert .mp4 to .flv then you will be happy.  If you do that, I would convert it to F4V instead of FLV as why would you want a less quality game to watch, and besides you're not streaming it, which is what FLV was invented for due to it's high compression.  Thanks a bunch as usual Nepotu, you're a Saint!!!  :)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-08T00:42Z,"You're all welcome and thank you all my friends, for your comments! Now, some particular answers: @nikita: I'll try to but I can't find anything for the moment. @ChasUGC and @brown_turd, thank you guys for your help, especialy brown_turd. @000rich, I can't do that sort of things. Sorry! You get your answer from brown_turd. Thank you all!"
,tibird,2012-08-08T11:46Z,thanks for all your hard work nepotu. I really appreciate it
,bassposaune,2012-08-09T02:09Z,"Thanks Nepotu!!! VERY MUCH!!!

I've been wanting to say thank you so much for so long but been having login problems forever.  Now, I'm finally in.

So glad you are doing these games.  I hope you don't get too burned out on this cuz that's a lot of work dude.

I hope you at least do these until the gold medal game?  I HOPE!!!!

Also, is there any way you could upload the women's football games in 720p?  Particular the USA vs. Canada (THAT WAS A KICKASS GAME!!!) & ALSO tomorrow's gold medal game?  Especially in 720p?  PLEASE!!!!!"
,000rich,2012-08-09T16:13Z,"hey nepotu sorry bout that

my laptop has very limited capabilities. i would convert it if this baby could haha my laptop's just too old. and if im not mistaken i downloaded an flv file thru one of your older torrents so i just took my chances

my apologies to anyone who got offended. still, thanks nepotu. im amazed with how much work you put into doing all this, just so we can watch."
,000rich,2012-08-09T16:14Z,"oh yeah, you recommend a video player that can accommodate the videos you put up? maybe that will help me out. thanks man"
