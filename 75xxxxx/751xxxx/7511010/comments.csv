,raenkae,2012-08-10T14:54Z,"Elimgazou: Now Im not so much for slandering people who are since long dead (or even if they have existed in the first place), but you wrote that muhammad was ""pure"" in life as in death..

It is highly immoral to bestow mere mortals supernatural characteristics as islamists often do regarding the ""profet"" Muhammad. This lead me on the thoughts that regarding muslims, their profet is a god in all but name. As they also ""godly"" cover his face in all depictions of him.

Kim-Jong Il and Mao Tse Tung are also people like Muhammad that are in the eyes of their followers ""perfect"".

There is NO perfect human, not even the ""profet"" Muhammad, or even ""Jesus of Nazareth"" or even Siddharta Gautama. We must ALL stop living in our bubbles of ignorance! First then we can hope for an better world!"

Islam is a religion of intolerance, contrary to the islamic propaganda! The muslims have only one answer to any critisim to their precious prophet and anything else which the consider holy, VIOLENCE!

Try to criticize mohammad in any islamic country, even in the slightest, and u better be prepared for being executed or killed by the angry mobs or have som sort of imam put a death fatwa on your head! That is the true face of islam, oppressive, violent, intolerant.

The true face of islam is not very pretty, neither is the true face of it's prophet, that is why no criticism is tolerated, otherwise there is a huge risk that they both will be seen for what they truly are!"
