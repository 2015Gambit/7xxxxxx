RTM = Release To Manufacturers, this means that it is the final Windows 8 that is going to be in stores the 26th of October 2012. They released it to PC manufacturers early in August, 2012 so by October, 2012 you can buy new computers with Windows 8.

Windows 8 RTM Build 9200 is the same version that is going to be available in stores in October 26, 2012."
