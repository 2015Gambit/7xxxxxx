Giacomo Puccini's most beloved opera -- the inspiration for the modern Broadway hit "Rent" -- blossoms in a memorable production in Beijing's Tianquiao Theatre. This performance was filmed during the Genoa Opera Company's historic tour of the People's Republic of China in 1986. World-renowned tenor Luciano Pavarotti sings the role of the poet Rodolfo, with Fiamma Izzo D'Amico performing the part of his tragic love interest, Mimi.

La bohème is an opera in four acts, by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on Scènes de la vie de bohème by Henri Murger. The world premiere performance of La bohème was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio and conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. Since then, La bohème has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is the fourth most frequently performed opera worldwide. In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was eventually released on records and on Compact Disc. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.
