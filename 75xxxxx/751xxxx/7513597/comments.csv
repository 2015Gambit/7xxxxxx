,TH4N4T0S,2012-08-12T11:12Z,"Awesome. Thanks! The download is rather slow, though. I hope you keep seeding."
,PowerOfThePoor1992,2012-08-13T01:58Z,"good torrent mate :)

And thanks you for fixing it for those guys mate... "
,Vee-Man92,2012-08-13T12:18Z,@ SashiMurai ... is this the complete workout with everything I need or do I need to download another torrent too?
,SashiMurai,2012-08-13T20:22Z,"Vee-Man92,

This is the supplement to the torrent listed in the description. It is the total ""insane Home fat loss"" program, but the rest of the program (six pack shortcuts, along with the videos for the zero willpower eating system, and the workout vault) are all located in the other torrent."
,SashiMurai,2012-09-01T16:45Z,"Note: In order to incorporate IHFL to the original program (the one detailed in the workout guide), replace original workout days 3 and 4 with two days from Insane Home Fat Loss. IE,

Week 1.
Day 1 of SPS
Day 2 of SPS
Day 1 of IHFL
Day 2 of IHFL
Day 1 of SPS 
Rest
Rest 

Week 2.
Day 2 of SPS
Day 3 of IHFL
Day 4 of IHFL
Day 1 of SPS
Day 2 of SPS
etc."
