Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, August 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with the critically acclaimed author of psycho-political thrillers and former State Department official, Steve Pieczenik, about the rumored selection of CIA director General David Petraeus as Mitt Romney's running mate. Pieczenik's books include State of Emergency, Pax Pacifica, and a number of fiction titles under Tom Clancy's imprint. 

Alex also talks with researcher and author Webster Tarpley about the latest developments in Syria as the push to depose Assad intensifies. Webster also addresses the Petraeus issue.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
