  Taking their cues from '80s synth pop, new wave, and the bedroom electronica of the Postal Service, Paper Route make their full-length debut with Absence, an album whose quiet grandeur is strikingly reminiscent of Stars of Track and Field's Centuries Before Love and War. At its strongest, Paper Route's twittering, textured music is both melodically and structurally engaging, its riffs flanked by electronic blips and speaker-to-speaker pans that help widen the band's palette.
