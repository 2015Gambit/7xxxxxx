ITV's 1997 "Reckless" and 1998

"Reckless, The Sequel" (or "Reckless, The Movie")

starring Robson Green, Francesca Annis and Michael Kitchen
written by Paul Abbott

100 mins 720x480 x264 aac mp4 684MB per 'episode'

DVD rip from the US PBS discs, so there are 3x100 mins parts for the original series and 1x100 mins sequel. I have removed all the annoying PBS talking-head intros, spoilers, and DVD sales pitches.

The DVD case warns of poor quality source material (i.e. old broadcast tapes), and it occassionally shows, but not too badly. In any event, good fun to watch.

Plot: Young doctor returns to Mancherster via train, meets attractive older (than him) woman and falls for her. Unbeknownst  to him, she is...(I don't want to spoil it for you).
