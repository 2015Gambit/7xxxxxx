Denver Post:

"Charlie Sheen ranted his way through his tour's 18th show Thursday night at the Wells Fargo Theatre, admittedly "pacing like a caged lion" on the lecture hall's expansive stage.

Was Sheen's event a concert? A stand-up gig? Story hour with Charlie?

No, his latest "Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour stop was more like a therapy session, with Sheen taking the mike, spotlight and couch to unload the last few months of drama on a half-full, yet totally jazzed, crowd."
