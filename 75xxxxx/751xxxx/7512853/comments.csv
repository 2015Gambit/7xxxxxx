,infamanious,2012-08-21T08:10Z,Why is it constantly stopping?  Hits 1 kb/s and then shit cans...whats going on here. As i understand these are the torrents for anime but fact is the trackers are none existent? Am i mistaken..
,infamanious,2012-08-22T06:12Z,thanks for this... :)
[V],horrorhound,2012-08-28T21:14Z,"the torrent files inside this torrent are directly from demon seeing the demon tracker is dead now the secondaries will take over but it will show red data bar, that is normal just means the tracker is dead. They all have backups."
,infamanious,2012-09-12T07:23Z,"any insight on demonoid and it's possible alternate?  If not perhaps more anime?..thanks in advance am looking forward to it, and seeding as well."
