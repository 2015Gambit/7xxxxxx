,dawnguard767,2012-08-11T01:13Z,I've been stuck at 99.89% for the last six hours. No one is seeding at 100% we all seem to be stuck.
,dawnguard767,2012-08-11T01:18Z,Stuck at 99.87% like everyone else
,pzulo,2012-08-11T02:25Z,well why dont you seed it feklhr????
,pzulo,2012-08-11T02:26Z,its rather assumable that you have already downloaded it your self and it works
,sold2sci,2012-08-11T03:08Z,So painful.... 24 hours at 99%
,dawnguard767,2012-08-11T03:19Z,"@ feklhr7, can you continue to seed? It seems that NOBODY has reached 100%. That means that until you finish seeding, we are all SOL."

,bxbliz05,2012-08-11T08:03Z,please seed!!!!! 3 days now still at 99.8% does this torrent really work? is it updated?
,bbogie,2012-08-11T09:19Z,"Can you seed this, even if you seed it for like 20 min max you will have about 30 people at 100%. And most people like myself will seed. Thank you."
,KGBmonster,2012-08-11T09:25Z,"yea, ill seed too when its done"
,ToughRu,2012-08-11T09:27Z,"No, damnit, it's not updated & every one is stuck at the same point. I've uploaded over 40 Gb of this crap before I deleted this shit :("
,pzulo,2012-08-11T15:38Z,ill seed but everyone just keeps bloody getting stuck so right now i just restarted and im back on 20%...
,pzulo,2012-08-11T15:55Z,yo guys quick question i got a version of skyrim without dawnguard is there a way to transfer saves from that skyrim to this version with the additional dawnguard? cause i like my character a lot and i don't want to lose all my progress...
,dawnguard767,2012-08-11T17:51Z,"@ feklhr7, please be considerate enough to let us know if you intend to help finish the seed or if you've abandoned it.  I'd rather not delete the 8.53 gigs that right now are totally useless to me and everybody else if I don't have to. Please?"
,pzulo,2012-08-11T18:08Z,if anyone does get this done and please please please seed this for all the other mac players who want this
,sebolito,2012-08-11T18:23Z,wtf im stuck!!! 
,posixoddity,2012-08-11T20:45Z,"@sebolito Welcome to the club pal.  Feklhr7 I don't know when you will read through this comments if at all, most likely you are out of town or your computer went down or something, making it so you couldn't seed.  Great of you to upload this torrent though, should save me a lot of time getting everything installed and update manually."
,Willembvd,2012-08-11T23:10Z,Can you seed for maybe an hour and then all of us can seed for you and enjoy the game? Thanks in advance!
,pzulo,2012-08-12T01:16Z,@ williembvd feklhr7 is hopeless personally im about to give up on him...
,Willembvd,2012-08-12T04:44Z,"@pzulo I'll give him a day or two, Skyrim is worth the wait in my mind..."
,lasteno,2012-08-12T06:09Z,"well I have download from ""pallthetold winskin wrapper"" and just put my skyrim dawnguard windows folder in set it, and I playing it on Mac Lion 10.7.7 without any problems so far =) 'cos this torrent is a fake ยก"
,lasteno,2012-08-12T06:26Z,"sorry anot 10.7.7 is Mac Lion 10.7.4 =) anyone can do it is simple, allready updated to Skytim 1.7.7.0.6 
runs better than using Parallelsdesktop or Haaving to reboot to Bootcamp =)"
,pzulo,2012-08-12T17:04Z,@ willembvd agreed its worth the wait and lasteno what are you talking about using bootcamp on mac to play skyrim????
,Goleas,2012-08-12T20:29Z,Don't download. Im the only one seeding... uploaded over 15 gb's but its stuck at 99.9% :
,posixoddity,2012-08-12T20:37Z,"@Lasteno would you upload your stuff then?  Totally worth the wait, I still have faith in this guy, he is probably just away from his computer or something.  He hasn't been responding to any of the comments, so either he is just being a douche or he can't respond."
,lasteno,2012-08-13T01:01Z,"posixoddity: yes no problem, i have never upload a torrent but I'll do it for you, give me just 30 min =) to figure it out how to upload a torrent, "
,posixoddity,2012-08-13T02:49Z,"@Lasteno, go to browse, then upload. Shit man you are a badass."
,lasteno,2012-08-13T03:59Z,"Ready if you want to download it, just one thing My internet upload speed is very slow 100 kb/s so I suggest that someone that has a Fast internet upload connection download it first and then share it with the rest =)

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7527231"
,lasteno,2012-08-13T04:26Z,posixoddity: what's your ip adrees so I just let you upload my torrent fisrt and then we both start sharing it ? do  you have a fast internet upload connection? 
,orestis.x,2012-08-13T12:56Z,"I have the skyrim.
Is there any way to upgrade it to dawnguard without lost my current games?"
,notrose,2012-08-14T00:32Z,"For those of you still stuck at 99%, I think it's safe to assume Feklhr has abandoned the torrent. But lateno has a new one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7527231"
