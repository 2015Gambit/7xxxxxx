A=3
V=-3"
,legio9,2012-08-08T03:15Z,"Another re-labelled copy of the Hindi first copy with English overlay.

Based on QUALITY no matter the source:

V=1
A=1

Extremely sub standard and a waste of bandwidth.

Another idiot who take a shit source and think he can make shit better than shit...and end up with shit. (no surprise)"
,legio9,2012-08-08T03:18Z,"Same hindi shit source with  an English overlay.

Based on QUALITY no matter the source:

V=1
A=1

Extremely sub standard.


When you take SHIT..no matter what you do with it, it will still be SHIT.

No free or not..do you want SHIT?"
,JustThaTip,2012-08-08T17:22Z,"now legio9, youre getting off topic, and offensive.
all you trolls and troll feeders need to bend over so we can play a game, its called
Just the tip   Just for a minute....

now to rate i would say a/5   v/3 for a cam
if youre looking at quality in general and not taking this being a cam into factor... yes  a/1   v/1, but if you have EVER used this site before then you know any movie still in theatres is gonna be a cam... so plan accordingly on how and what you D/L..."
,DreaD151,2012-08-08T17:27Z,"please everyone realize i am trying to get the word out so you know the facts.....everyone gets the same copies and they do their thing and maybe make a torrent or have someone else do it the tweaks are what set them apart for each other when a new copy is released all the same people will get that as well and re release it with diffrent tweaks and/or a update of the quality (TS,R5,PPV,DVDrip,BRrip,etc) so other peoples work its not being stole the tweaks maybe to light of a touch or too little to notice and may seem to be copied but all the editors,scripters,pirates alike usually get the movie from the same source.....thanks for all the hard work they do or dont and the risk they take.."
,DreaD151,2012-08-08T17:31Z,emphasis on the sarcasm......it gets old looking at the comments accusing each other of theft or lack of orginality ..been on the underground for sooo long back when u used accoustic modems and windows 3.1 beta to get a bootleg copy of doom hhahaha
,DreaD151,2012-08-08T17:32Z,thanks @justthatip finally i am not alone
