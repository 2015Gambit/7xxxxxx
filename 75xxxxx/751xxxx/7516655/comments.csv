,Giobemo,2012-08-11T19:04Z,tried playing this with 5 different media players but no joy. video is super slow and skips every 10-15 seconds.  :(  Thanks for trying anyway though!

Use LAV codecs and Media Player Classic Home Cinema. If you can't play it still because your computer can't handle it, then just re-encode it yourself using something simple like Format Factory or Total Media Converter and make it 29fps/720p or 480p/lower bitrate."

p.s. it does play sporadically, but skips throughout and pixelates often..."

It works fine for me with windows media player windows 7 ultimate 64bit.  Get rid of the HIPSTER MAC SHIT!!!!  Thanx for the vid, great quality SecTB."
