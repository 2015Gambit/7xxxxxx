
In the biggest official files leak in history nearly 400,000 Iraq war logs 

reveal the massive scale of civilian deaths and new torture allegations 

following an investigation by Channel 4ΓÇ▓s Dispatches.

Channel 4 News has accessed the data in the classified documents via The Bureau 

of Investigative Journalism and WikiLeaks.

The only TV doc to have advance access to the biggest Wikileaks release ever. 

This is what really happened during the Iraq war, not what the US PR machine of 

the time wanted us to believe. The reality behind the civilian death count; al-

QaedaΓÇÖs fictitious presence; torture, torture and more torture. A wall of truth 

revealing unprecedented levels of unwarranted aggression.

Dispatches, Channel 4ΓÇ▓s flagship current affairs strand, exposes the full and 

unreported horror of the Iraqi conflict and its aftermath, revealing the true 

scale of civilian casualties and allegations that even after the scandal of Abu 

Ghraib, American soldiers continued to abuse prisoners.

And that US forces did not systematically intervene in the torture and murder 

of detainees by the Iraqi security services. The programme also features 

previously unreported material of insurgents being killed while trying to 

surrender.
