Please note that my ISP provider only allows 75kbps upload speed. So be patient as I will seed this for as long as it takes.
If you complete this download please seed for the benefit of others."

,yohnivek,2012-08-10T05:51Z,"Thanks dude,
However I have read in the comments on this download that it is just an english translation of the Russian commentry. Not The BBC1 version.
I will download the tools you suggested for future use.
When anyone completes this download please let me knpw if it works for you.
