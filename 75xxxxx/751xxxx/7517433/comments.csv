,kund84,2012-08-09T14:41Z,"This works for sure, ""Alpha Omega"" why is my windows 8 activated then?  I don't think that you have tried this, otherwise you have failed big-time trying."
,Alpha.Omega,2012-08-09T15:24Z,"i've tried both. none works. the question is when did you use it.. all of us this past few days trying to activate with all sorts of activators and kms methods failed coz MS itselt stopped & blocked activation temporarily.. Windows8 on setting itself says no activation, try later.
anyways congratz if ur one of the lucky few who are able to have yours activated. "

All activators not working, because KMS Servers are offline. Tested in Enterprise."
,techme21,2012-08-09T23:21Z,"I made a simple batch file that will connect to all three known kms servers
and attempt activation with them automatically
It does all commands silently so you don't have all of those annoying popups from every attempt
and it will loop infinitely
My goal is to make it stop Automatically when An activation server has been reached,
And Echo Windows Successfully!
Just paste the below code into a notepad and save as Activate.bat to C:    root directory
Then make a shortcut to that file on your desktop.
Then right click the shortcut and go to ""Properties""
Then go to the Shortcut Tab
Then click advanced
Then check the ""Run as Administrator"" box
Hit OK and OK again
Now run it

Maybe this could be a base idea for a Windows based KMS Activation Program
Then you could add the option of adding your own KMS server.

P.S. If the servers are down then my above script will not work.
It will just keep trying until it does work.

Here's what I got so far

[CODE]
@Echo Off

Echo Attempting Windows Activation
Echo Please Wait...

cscript //B ""%windir%system32slmgr.vbs"" /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688
