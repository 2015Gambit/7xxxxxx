  Blending digital-age pop/rock with ambient electronics, the Nashville-based Paper Route had their start in the summer of 2004, when Chad Howat began staying up all night in his apartment while making music with a variety of instruments and programmed samples. Former bandmate J.T. Daly joined the effort, followed one month later by the arrival of another former bandmate, Andy Smith, who added vocals, guitar, harmonica, and synthesizer to the mix. Following some further contributions, the trio soon completed enough material for an EP, which was issued in August 2006 though Drama Club Records. Faced with the challenge of translating their sound to the stage, Paper Route enlisted the help of drummer Gavin McDonald, who joined in time for the creation of the band's debut album, Absence.
