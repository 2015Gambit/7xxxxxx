On a quest to find the best, and most obscure, museum exhibits and explore the secrets they hold, Museum Secrets uncovers the weird, the astonishing and fascinating wonders of the world. What unexpected device did Catherine the Great use to enhance her sex life? Why did Alexander the Great prefer linen armour to bronze? And how did the falcon hunting of the Habsburg emperors lay the foundations for modern science? Testing out the theories behind the artifacts and visiting the sites they originated from, this series combines pure enthralling history with surprising detective work.




7)  Metropolitan Museum of Art New York 
New York is one of the most metropolitan and busy cities in the world, and right in the middle of it is The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Known informally as the Met, it is one of the world's largest art galleries. Boasting over 2 million works from prehistory to the present day in galleries visited by over 5 million people every year, the Met houses artefacts that hide tales of tragedy, madness and even murder. A suit of armour on display belonged to King Henry VIII. Believed to have been made towards the end of his life, what stories can the armour reveal about the infamous monarch?
