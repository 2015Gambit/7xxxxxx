Storyline:
It is the 23rd Century. The Federation starship USS Enterprise is on routine training maneuvers,
and Admiral James T. Kirk seems resigned to the fact that this may well be the last space mission of his career.
But Khan is back. Aided by his exiled band of genetic supermen, Khan--brilliant renegade of 20th Century Earth--has raided Space Station Regula One,
stolen a top secret device called Project Genesis, wrested control of another Federation starship, and now schemes to set a most deadly trap for his old enemy Kirk.
