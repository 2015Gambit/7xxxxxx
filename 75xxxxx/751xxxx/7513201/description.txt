Hearing Ginsberg is the way to know Ginsberg, the most well-known poet of the Beats. His questioning, analysis, and forgiveness of human frailty are fully heard as he calls out his indictments. Drunkenness! Ashcan rantings! Cigarettes in boxcars, boxcars, boxcars. To hear Ginsberg name emotions and experiences is a warm mosaic of poetic immersion. The lilting twang of the way he pronounces "love," the satisfied way he says "kabala" will make the cosmos vibrate at your feet. Ginsberg's poetry is about pronouncements, and this recording captures their joyful spirit. Ginsburg roars, chants, and recites with a bard's presence.
