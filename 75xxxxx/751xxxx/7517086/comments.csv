[V],psspss,2012-08-09T15:12Z,never heard of it.. I only share stuff I watch or may watch plus im not in usa 
[V],psspss,2012-08-09T16:44Z,"i have found sources.. will need process them and bundle in a S04E01-E05

so how about sharing all of S01 S03 and S02
for everyone.. as no one is seeding them

seems a few want the S01E10 and S01E05
if have it.."
