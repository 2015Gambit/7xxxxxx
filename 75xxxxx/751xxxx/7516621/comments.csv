,nbrazil,2012-08-09T12:13Z,"Nope, ran on NBC at 11 PM tonight. Couldn't see it in my area because the cable crapped out."
,gilknut,2012-08-09T12:24Z,"@BlackandBad: ""joey from seinfield is in this one"" -- what the fuck are you on about?
First of all, there is no Joey in ""Seinfeld"" (not ""Seinfield""). There was a Joey in ""Friends"", but that's Matt Le Blanc who now stars in ""Episodes"", which is a different show from this one. There was however a Chandler in Friends, played by Matthew Perry. HE is in this one.   "
