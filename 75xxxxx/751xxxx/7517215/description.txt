Museum Secrets Collection 
On a quest to find the best, and most obscure, museum exhibits and explore the secrets they hold, Museum Secrets uncovers the weird, the astonishing and fascinating wonders of the world. What unexpected device did Catherine the Great use to enhance her sex life? Why did Alexander the Great prefer linen armour to bronze? And how did the falcon hunting of the Habsburg emperors lay the foundations for modern science? Testing out the theories behind the artifacts and visiting the sites they originated from, this series combines pure enthralling history with surprising detective work.




6)  Topkapi Palace Museum Istanbul 
Once the palace of the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire, Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul is a vast treasury of Islamic culture, science and weaponry, visited by over 2 million people every year. In this episode, at the foot of Istanbul's ancient walls we discover how a Muslim invader bested Christian defenders by using their superstitions against them. In the city's famed spice market we seek a poison to assassinate a Sultan, and then in the Sultan's private residence we investigate how a Harem slave rose to rule an empire. On the sea at the museum's doorstep we discover how a Turkish admiral got his hands on the lost map of Christopher Columbus, then unearth a forgotten civilization that fought the mighty Pharaohs of Egypt to a draw. And finally, we test Islamic scientific theories to create a working model of the world's first robot.
