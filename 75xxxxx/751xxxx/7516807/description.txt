Notes: Enjoy this sexy little romp in the woods a little early. Titties and
gore, from what I'm told. And Michael Biehn with his sexy wife. Oh... And
Danielle Harris. The watermark, as you can see, lasts throughout the movie. It's
not an identifying marker, so it hasn't been blurred. If you prefer it blurred,
do so yourself

AXED! We do this better
