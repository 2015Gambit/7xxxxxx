,finalfate62,2012-08-18T22:15Z,"@bboss93, it is 256 kbps. It doesn't sound like it but if you download a 128 kbps, you will notice the huge difference."
,dover1993,2012-08-20T10:50Z,I will be honest the free download that axe is offering has better quality. but i wouldnt have known about the song if i had not found this. so i still thank you very much!
