,bidawi,2012-08-07T04:54Z,Why is this file almost double the size of the ML intaller? Thanks.
,pryingeyes,2012-08-07T06:14Z,"Yeah, that's one question. Some others:

What ""older machines"" will it work on? What are the system requirements? What concessions (graphics? functionality? others?) were made to allow this to work? Where did you get it? And, best of all:

Why aren't you seeding???"
,fiskekatta,2012-08-07T12:28Z,"Come on seeders.... Wonder why there is only one here, but in the app it says 11 seeders, but still 0 connectable... Please seed!!!!"
,sebolito,2012-08-08T04:30Z,fake shit
,bidawi,2012-08-08T05:33Z,"It'll take years to DL. So, how do u know it's fake?"
,lowed,2012-08-08T06:27Z,"I uploaded this for a friend that has a 2005 model that has lion on it but is not ""allowed"" to upgrade to ML so i added his model to the alowed list as well as other other machines. the reason it's 9 GB is becaused its uncompressed iso instead of dmg which is encrypted. if this doesnt work for you i can always add your mac number ie mackbook 6,1. however you should do back ups before using this untested build. this was never meant for the public to try. I never thought people would try it."
,lowed,2012-08-08T06:30Z,"ill let you know if it works soon on older models apple deems not worthy. it will work on newer models, this was just for the older machines. if you're looking for ML for a newer machine look for a torrent that has more seeds."
,fiskekatta,2012-08-08T17:24Z,"But why don't you share /seed it then? We are plenty of people how is looking for a release like this? Does it support the Mac Pro 1,1 (2006)?"
,fiskekatta,2012-08-09T10:31Z,Why don't you share and seed this copy then?
