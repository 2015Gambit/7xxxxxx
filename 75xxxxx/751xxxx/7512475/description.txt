New features in Picasa 3.9
Picasa 3.9 lets you share directly to Google+ and offers a much richer selection of editing tools. Check out the Picasa 3.9 guide for more details about the latest Picasa version.
Share to your Google+ circles -- If you've joined Google+, you can use Picasa 3.9 to share directly to the circles you've created in Google+. They'll see your photos and videos in their Google+ stream. People that don't use Google+ aren't left out. They'll get an email to view your album in Google+, and they don't have to join to do so.
Picasa name tags on Google+ -- If you've joined Google+, you may have noticed that name tags have become more social. With the release of Picasa 3.9, you can now upload and share your name tags on Google+. Note that if you choose not to join Google+, name tags won't change at all.
New photo editing effects -- We've added a plethora of new editing effects like Vignette, Duo-tone, Borders and more.
Side by side editing -- Compare two different photos side by side. Or compare the original and edited versions versions of the same photo simultaneously as you apply edits in Picasa. Learn how to edit side by side.
