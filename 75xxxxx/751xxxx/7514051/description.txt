Day 62 of Big Brother saw Deana and Ashleigh clash, the housemates watch their launch night profile videos And Deana apologise to Luke S. It had been 2days since Conor beat Luke S to winning ┬ú50,000 and it seemed that the events manager was still feeling low about his lost opportunity. Deana may have patched things up with Luke S but later on it was time for her to lock horns with his other half, Ahleigh.
