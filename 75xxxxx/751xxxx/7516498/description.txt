Back in the 1950s, when most people didn't know what stereo was, RCA decided it needed a spiffy demonstration record to show off stereo, something the owner of a new RCA stereo player could put on when the neighbors dropped by and to make them green with envy ... and rush out and buy a RCA stereo player of their own. Those droll radio comic Bob & Ray were brought in to create some skits to scatter among the tracks, and the result was "Bob and Ray Throw a Stereo Spectacular." It's long been a sought-after rarity, not just by crazed Bob and Ray fans, but mostly because this endearing bit of tomfoolery showcased some of the most thrilling (and offbeat) tracks from RCA's earliest "Living Stereo" catalogue. In the 1990s, Classic Records briefly reissued the album in an audiophile vinyl edition and Classic Compact Discs did a gold CD, from whence these files spang.
