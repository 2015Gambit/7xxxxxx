If we wanted to go to scenetime's web site we wouldnt come to TPB's site.

If you cant post the proper info in the box above,than why bother to post at all?"
,giggedyguy,2012-08-09T18:02Z,"This is basically the same copy uploaded days ago.  Missing right portion of the video, askew and hard to even recognize the actors due to distortion in the video. Don't care what group takes credit, a bad cam is a bad cam. I've seen several REALLY good cam jobs over the years but it's such a rare occasion I can never remember who did them (I watch a LOT of videos). "
