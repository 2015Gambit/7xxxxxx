"Basics Typography: Virtual Typography" addresses a fundamentally new form of typographical communication. The book explores the visual arrangement of words and letters in the context of multimedia. Here, this arrangement is not simply a spatial positioning of text information it is also bound by time. The increasing use of moving, virtual type can help to harmonise this time-based presentation of words on screen. The book touches on work from a variety of designers, including Channel 4 and Pentagram Design. This will provide an excellent introduction to the latest methods in typographical and visual communication.
