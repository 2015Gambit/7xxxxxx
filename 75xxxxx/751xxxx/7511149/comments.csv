When they recap it later in the day, it's usually this truncated, abridged package where they skip all but the winners. I really appreciate all of TvTeam's hard work. Cheers and many thanks."
,prinlm,2012-08-07T14:49Z,Not gonna up Men's Artistic Gymnastics Individual Finals mate?
,OpatheOne,2012-08-07T20:24Z,I was so impressed with the Germans today. Nguyen and Hambuechen did excellent
,NTA-Pro,2012-08-08T08:03Z,A little confused about this. What exactly is the mixed finals? I'm a little new to the format
,aquaninja,2012-08-08T09:11Z,"Mixed finals is another way to say ""Event Finals day #"" where they show both men's and women's finals over three days"
,ati.bug,2012-08-08T16:15Z,Can someone tell me which events are in this final? I have watched them all on the TV and now want them for my hard drive but I'm worried I am going to download what I already have of the finals. Thanks in advance.

The Men's Rings, then, the Women's Wuneven Bars, and finally, the Men's Vault.

The events of the third and final day are in this torrent:

It has the Men's Parallel Bars, the Women's Balance Beam, the Men's Horizental Bar, and the Women's Floor Exercise.

The events of the first day of apparatus' finals and the individual all-around for men couldn't be found any where. I hope we can have it any time soon."
