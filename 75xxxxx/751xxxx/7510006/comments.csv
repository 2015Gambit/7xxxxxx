,SrMLove,2012-08-08T03:48Z,to avoid fakes make sure you check the torrent before d/l it.... b/c EZTV has been putting out B/S passcoded rar files.... not just for this show either... and glitched files and just overall poor quality of work and relying solely on their name. which doesnt mean what it use to( this is from multiple experiences/downloads.... just don't assume  b/c it says EZTV)........... FYI......
,SrMLove,2012-08-08T03:52Z,i personally suggest getting their torrents only if they are in MP4 format... b/c that is the format of the files of quality that ive gotten from the EZTV team since this password/RAR shit.
