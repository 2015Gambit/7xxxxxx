,ccbg,2012-08-12T10:30Z,"I upload this torrent about 10 times the size of it but I see that nobody get over 93.1%. Then I force recheck and now my torrent is 93.1% too. My source files seem ok. I have no idea what is happening.

Can any body help me to fix it. If not, maybe I have to upload it again but I am not sure whether this will solve the problem "
