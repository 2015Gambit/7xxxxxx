Multi award winning (Australian) guerrilla independent documentary.

It undertakes a highly entertaining tongue-in-cheek investigation into the impact of the sudden discovery of Magic Mushrooms growing in an 'Enchanted Forest', near the tiny rural town of Balingup, in south-West Australia. Pop 397.

The Aztecs and many other ancient peoples used Magic Mushrooms in the worship of their deities. Vikings went berserk after eating them. Hippies across the planet have been using this 'forbidden fruit' for years. 

Meet the 'Shroomers, The Police, The local Balingup residents: Angry, nervous, & sometimes supportive; medical professionals & a Mycologist (biologist specializing in the study of Fungi) who studied alongside Sir David Attenborough at Cambridge University (literally).

This film leads us far beyond the picturesque vistas of Balingup and into the international politics of 'The War On Drugs'

Fact Is Often Stranger Than Fiction...

ENJOY!!
