The recording is simply amazing. Crystal clear soundboard (although some sources mention this may be sourced from radio).
Either way it sounds like an official release so if you don't have it, don't wait! This is Radiohead in the middle of their 
2003 tour and this show is really moving and inspired. Actually I still have no opionion on the new album, it's too new to
really have a judgement on it. But Radiohead have always been a source of surprises for me. So, looking forward for the new
tour, here is some vintage stuff (kind of...).

Enjoy!
