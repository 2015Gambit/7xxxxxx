Can I activate my copy of Windows 8 through a publicly accessible KMS Server?
An additional KMS server has been allowing people to successfully activate Windows 8.
Make sure your computer's clock accurate and your time zone is correct, then run the following commands in the Command Prompt as Administrator

For Win 8 Enterprise:

slmgr /skms 91.149.135.121
slmgr.vbs -ato


For Win 8 Professional:

slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms 91.149.135.121
slmgr.vbs -ato


For Win 8 Professional With WMC:

slmgr.vbs -ipk GNBB8-YVD74-QJHX6-27H4K-8QHDG
slmgr /skms 91.149.135.121
slmgr.vbs -ato

Key to install Media Center(after you've installed Win 8 Pro):
RR3BN-3YY9P-9D7FC-7J4YF-QGJXW

Don't forget to add this in admin command prompt after KMS activation

slmgr /skms localhost

The command will set KMS address to localhost and will prevent unnecessary pings (every 30 days) to internet KMS server after activation.
