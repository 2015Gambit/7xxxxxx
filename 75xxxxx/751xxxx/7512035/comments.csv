,dhedge,2012-08-09T04:20Z,Thanks XBT you are the best. Could you add Idemdall's Folly from Steam to the list? It has a really well voiceacted remake of lilacor from Baldur's Gate like the sentient sword mod from morrowind. I must have!!! Thanks!
,insane_goofball,2012-08-12T05:35Z,"one of your other nexus mod managers a guy posted about it being a windows 64 bit app. he says that because in uninstall folder has a setup/remove exe. you run that, and it gives you a only run in 64bit error. I try to run nexusclient.exe and I get this: The Application failed to initialize properly (0x0000135) click on OK to terminate the application. Is anyone else getting this error ? I am using Razor1911 version of skyrim, and windows xp pro sp3 32 bit. I do appreciate all the effort XBT, not knocking you by any means."
,isilox,2012-08-12T14:23Z,Could you please upload your Skyrim directory? Personaly I'd much rather play Skyrim already modded by someone else than spend endless time modding it.
,Etg50,2012-08-12T17:33Z,Have you already uploaded skyrim realistic overhaul if you have than please tell me in which torrent.If you post a link of the torrent that will be really nice thanks.that mod is really big and i don't have the speed to download it from nexues.:P 
,Etg50,2012-08-12T17:41Z,Could you please upload skyrim realistic overhaul mod if you already have then please post a link to the torrent i really want that mod but i dont have the speed to download it from nexues.
,amindro,2012-08-15T23:34Z,"I just recently saw your mod uploads and they're pretty awesome. I wanted to request the Adoption Service Mod, as its the only one I wanted off the workshop that you didn't have yet. Here is the link to the workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10338&searchtext=Adoption+Service
I looked for it on the Nexus and other sites but its not anywhere but the workshop -.-"
,Jona198102,2012-08-16T11:21Z,"Thank you for this.

Can you please do an update for Dragon Souls to Perks? I believe he's at 2.1 or 2.2 now and allows for upgrades to Health, Stamina, and Magika as well as configurable options for perk costs.

Thank you very much!!"
,herpaderpadoo,2012-08-25T19:17Z,"Would you kindly add Zelda Audio Conversion?

,elmowithagun,2012-08-27T12:28Z,"Hey -xbt-, could you please add the Sweet Roll Hut mod. It's a pretty dumb mod, but who doesn't love sweet rolls? Here's the link http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=72151175 If u can can do it would be super greatly appreciated :) thx anyway and keep up the good work."

,deaderweterdog,2012-09-09T06:26Z,sry thought it might be worth mentioning i need SKSE for 1.7.7.0 (dawnguard update) thanks again even just a link to an explination of how to do it myself would be apreciated      may steam rot in hell
,dhedge,2012-09-09T09:51Z,You get SKSE from here http://skse.silverlock.org/  and just copy paste it into your main skyrim folder 
,CatGT,2012-09-10T07:52Z,"Hey, XBT. Can you upload the ""Here there be Monsters"" mod in your next mod compilation please? I've looked all over and can't find it anywhere."
,amindro,2012-09-12T22:25Z,"Haha, nevermind my earlier request about the Adoption System, turns out they're adding one to Hearthfire anyway ~.~"
