Just started torrent and there is more people than what tpb reports and they all have diff clients..

rar's are there for a reason and if you don't know why then google it or something.. besides do you think he packed it ? of course not...
he delivered it as he got it.. wanna rant and rave at someone go and bitch at every scene group that ever existed.
They made the rule not sceneline.

Also about rar's, At TPB 100% of scene releasers are originaly rar'd  or they are scene nuked and its the TPB uploaders that are tryingto me nice and kiss ass to people like you and unpack them before uploading torrents.
And as far as i'm concerned i would rather have releases rar'd for many reasons.. again google it.
Although i don't mind if video's are unpacked.

Your rant and accusations are baseless
and you said it your self buddy.. go download from someone else and quit bitching, the scene groups arn't going to change their rules because of your TPB comments after all these years"

Oh and before you think your gonna give me a little condescending lecture on P2P.. bear in mind of been at this since the 90's and i have coded my own file sharing program !
What is it called ?
xpMule
And i started that program about 7/8 yrs ago"
