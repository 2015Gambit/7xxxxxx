,gs_p,2012-08-11T20:33Z,"On my Galaxy S3 (unrooted): Installed the APK, copied files to the correct folder, as soon as the game launches, asks for internet connection, ""waits"" for 20 secs and starts downloading 2Gb. The thing is that it actually worked in the end, validated the license and voilรก! Restarted, and everything is fine. Before this I tried the date change (as suggested for the batman game) but had the same result, the files on the folder were deleted, with the date change the whole folder, without changing date, there was 816Mb eft on the folder, and was continuing to download from there.
Hope this feedback helps, keep up the good work my friend!"

,lerijiso,2012-09-05T09:22Z,"It works. I thought it didn't at first. When I first started the game (after doing everything according to your instructions), It stays in the loading screen for like forever. Me having no patience keep restarting the app. I also restarted my tablet (sony tablet s). It still idles at the loading screen, so i gave up and let it be. After about 5 minutes, i checked back and to my surpirse, its starting to download the additional file. and the rest is history. Good job."
