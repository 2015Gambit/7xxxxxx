The all-new literary masterpiece from the creator of Essex County is finally here! As an underwater welder on an oilrig off the coast of Nova Scotia, Jack Joseph is used to the immense pressures of deep-sea work. Nothing, however, could prepare him for the pressures of impending fatherhood. As Jack dives deeper and deeper, he seems to pull further and further away from his young wife, and their unborn son. But then, something happens deep on the ocean floor: Jack has a strange and mind-bending encounter that will change the course of his life forever.
