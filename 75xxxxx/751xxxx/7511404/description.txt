Episode 8 : Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster 

By 2003 NASA was under extreme pressure to launch the shuttle Columbia. A number of previous missions had been aborted due to technical problems, but it would proved to be a decision that precluded the biggest disaster in NASA'S history. As the world watched, the unthinkable happened. When the shuttle re-entered the earth's atmosphere, a small undetected hole in the wing, caused by a small piece of foam dislodged during the launch, caused the shuttle to disintegrate into a screaming fireball.
