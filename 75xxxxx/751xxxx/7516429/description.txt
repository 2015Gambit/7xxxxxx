Synopsis:
 
Karl Vladimir Lennon J. Villalobos, aka Intoy, is secretly in love with his friend Jenny, the most beautiful girl in the campus.  Jenny is rich and quirky;  Intoy is street-smart and ordinary.  But this friendship is not simple, since Jenny has bestowed on Intoy some perks and privileges, including going to bed with her on the condition that they will not fall in love with each other.  Before graduation, Intoy feels that he has to shed his pretensions of being astig and finally profess his love for Jenny.   But he is devastated to learn that Jenny is pregnant.  Worse, Jenny tells him:  “Don’t worry, this is not yours.”  Based on the bestselling novel of Eros S. Atalia,  Ligo na U, Lapit na Me is an examination of postmodern love and relationship and the way this generation deals with their love and fear.
