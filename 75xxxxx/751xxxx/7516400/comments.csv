,shamanist,2012-08-10T02:01Z,"So you know that Glennboy probably had this ghostwritten, since few members of the tinhat/aluminumhat crowd can even write their own names. What a black hole to have on your resume..."
[T],AncientRome,2012-08-13T09:23Z,"Debate about whether Glenn is a loon or not, isn't going to take place here. The reason I enjoyed this book is because I got to see and learn about things I never imagined about George Washington.
It was interesting to find out that George loved ice cream and I was surprised to find out that ice cream existed back in the 1700's."
,shamanist,2012-08-13T19:50Z,"@AncientRome: So you are invoking a censorship on Glenn's IQ and/or emotional IQ? It is a fair point to raise, though... The book may be of very limited value if it is anything like his boobtube presentations, where he give a fact and then follow it with a solid hour of crap, including his single-digit IQ insights.

Out of mild interest, are you a mod that you can edit out free speech (comments) or is this just a vain threat that we cannot mention Glenn's alledged IQ?"
[T],AncientRome,2012-08-14T08:07Z,"@shamanist
The point is that this isn't a good place to debate whether someone is crazy or not. If you think this is a proper place to do such a thing then you are just as crazy as someone in the Loony Bin. There are forums for a reason.

It doesn't matter who is a mod, since I provided this torrent I deserve respect. Before trying to force your opinions on other people you should check to see whether your opinions are something you've created yourself and not what other people  simply told you."
,shamanist,2012-08-17T10:53Z,"@AncientRome: 

Where to begin. You presented me with a whole field of cow patties...don't want to miss a single one. 

1. First you say that debate about Beck's alledged IQ ""isn't going to take place here""--your dictatorial assessment. Yet, it is. And that is freedom of speech.

2. You set yourself up as judge and jury as to what is the proper place for this type of discussion and what is the proper place to have that type of discussion. Whoa, Miss Manners! Agreed that a forum might be a preferred place to discuss Beck's limitations, but that is preferred, not better. Again, the free speech thing. After all, I am not yelling 'fire' in a crowded theatre, correct?

3. Where did you get your degree in psychiatry? Or psychotherapy? You managed to mangle the logic process quite a bit there, son! To assume that because I offer a criticism and a caveat about Beck and his work and I don't get your approval for it then I must be the crazy one? By that twisted logic, all investigative reporters should be committed.

4.Thank you for pointing out the obvious that there are forums for a reason. Quite an insight. Congratulations...

5. Deserve respect for providing a torrent? Excuse me, but how many times did you icepick yourself in the head to come up with that one? You had a book you wanted to share and thought it was worth sharing. That is the primary motivation for anyone at TPB--to share what we value. You deserve thanks for sharing. You apparently mistake my criticism of Beck for criticism of you. Well, it isn't. As for respect, that is something I reserve for people I know, or people committing random acts of kindness. Posting a book is not an immediate good star.

6. And by that flawed logic, you demand that we should 'respect' avowed fascist like talmudtimmy who posts his anti-Semitic literature at TPB. He has posted a lot more than you have, all of it filled with lies and venom. Does that mean he deserves more respect than you?

7. I simply expressed an opinion about the merits of Beck's alledged IQ, and the opinion that he probably could not write a readable book on his own. BIG SURPRIZE for you, but a lot of 'personalities' have ghostwriters. At no point did I force my opinion on anyone and if you saw expressing my opinion as forcing an opinion on you, than I worry for you, son. Just how well do you handle criticism when it is directed to you? Because it seems you come unglued when I criticize an author you seemed to have enjoyed.

8. Lastly, my opinions originate with me. Others may express opinions, but I prefer to do my own investigating and deciding.

9. Back in the late 60s, while in college, I went through a truly great book that covered the correspondence between Washington and Ben Franklin. I believe it was a Uni of SC press volume. Amazing reading, and in their own words. One great piece of advice Franklin gave Washington was to marry a rich widow because she would be so grateful. Guess what? Yes, son, Martha was a rich widow. Don't know if she was grateful, but they never divorced... Anyway, if you can find the book, you will be rewarded tremendously by the reading of it."
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T03:03Z,"Hey AncientRome...

You're arguing with an idiot - you are aware of that right?  Don't answer the drive by's on Beck.  They are spewing crap out of their mouth that they know nothing about.  

The people who hate Beck, never listened to his show, never watched him on TV, never read a single book of his...  they are either glued to video games in their mothers basements, or have MSNBC feeding them their marching mantra's...

Glad to see you read this book.  Its one of the best I've read on George Washington aside from ""The Real George Washington"" - which is ALSO a fantastic book by the way, I read it early last year.   I highly recommend it...

You can find TRGW in the ""Patriot Bookshelf"" if you search here on TPB...  you'll find it, along with a wealth of other great HISTORICALLY ACCURATE books...   (you'll also find a bunch of other ""lightning rods"" in there as well for the left, along with some of the left's best as well...)

*** MERIT ***"
,shamanist,2012-08-22T09:59Z,"I see theamerikanpatriot did a drive-by himself to share his single-digit IQ. And he comes to share his intolerance of other opinions that don't meet his approval. And so quick to get into the fracas, just like any teenager whose ego has been wounded.

BTW, the kneejerk dismissal simply sidesteps the points that I made, and valid they were. But thanks for giving AncientRome your permission to ignore me nomatter how right I might be... Sure it means a lot to him."
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T22:55Z,"@Sham...  Really...  you are an idiot...  and you've pretty much proven yourself by rummaging through every Glenn Beck post you can find to harass those who read anything by him.

You are a very closed minded individual who has no better purpose in live but to harass others who actually want to open their minds and build upon their intelligence...  However, you have proven once again - you are lacking intelligence in many ways... 

So with that... I bid you ado...  Enjoy life knucklehead. "
,TheAmericanPatriot,2012-08-22T22:56Z,"All you have done is proven that the more the truth gets out there...  the more you lefty libtards start to froth at the mouth!  

I think its time to upload a few more great titles and watch you foam some more...  LOL  Its fun!"
