On July 31, Phish will release Chicago '94, a brand new 6-CD box set, showcasing two complete shows recorded live on June 18, 1994 and November 25, 1994 at UIC Pavilion in Chicago, IL.
 
By 1994, Phish was well established as an international touring act and already well known to a growing group of hardcore fans. Amidst a tour packed with highlights - it was this summer that convinced the band to start multi-tracking their live shows - this show was recorded for posterity on 2-track DAT. Lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place but Chicago '94 is an example of just that.

Paul Languedoc's stereo soundboard mixes re-mastered by Fred Kevorkian carry the intensity and intricacy of these special shows to listeners' ears eighteen years later. Chicago '94 contains nearly six hours of music performed at both shows for a total of 43 songs, including material from the UIC soundchecks. The shows are presented in a 6-CD box set with new artwork by longtime collaborator and Chicagoan, Jim Pollock.
