This book is the second in a series tracking the stories and identities of those who claimed to have survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn. It details the claims of thirty-three such ΓÇ£Lone Survivors.ΓÇ¥

Because of the extraordinary nature of CusterΓÇÖs Last Stand, extraordinary confirmation should be required of the account when assessing the validity of any claim to survivorship. If someone is able to reproduce the elements of the fight, it does not qualify them to the distinction of having lived through the event. There must be corroborating testimony, either by another person or through descriptions of an event that are undeniably accurate and largely consistent with other accounts of the battle.
