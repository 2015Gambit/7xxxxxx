Storyline
A factory worker, Douglas Quaid, begins to suspect that he is a spy after visiting Rekall - a company that provides its clients with implanted fake memories of a life they would like to have led - goes wrong and he finds himself on the run.

iMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386703/

Notes:
The Source had small res and has a pulse effect, colors were crap and it needed alot of work to bring it to life, I did what i could with it, so i just tweaked gamma, yuv, hue, sat, contrast, chroma, levels, deblock, denoise, crop, resize, sharpen and thats about it.

Audio is nice line synced and muxed.

READNFO is because we are doing a better video which were just fixing up good and proper, just thought for those who cant wait then here you go its better than nothing lol

Enjoy another UNiQUE release.......
