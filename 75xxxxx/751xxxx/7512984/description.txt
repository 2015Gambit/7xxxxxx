The Zoo: Series 2
This nicely observed series brings us the highs and lows of the zoo staff and their attempts to breed their creatures. Reptile keeper Ian does incredibly noble work with frogs on the edge of extinction called mountain chickens. He holds one up. "Look at those eyes, Beautiful, beautiful eyes," he says dreamily. Working so closely with animals every day means all the keepers at London Zoo and its countryside counterpart, Whipsnade, are besotted with their charges: Alex even admits that her gang of sea lions are her best friends. When you see the bond she has with them, you'll understand. Sarah Lancashire narrates.



2)  Part 2 
With limited space at the iconic London site, keepers constantly have to move animals around. Among the most popular animals are the playful Californian sea lions. However, their pool is being refurbished, forcing them and their keeper Alex to move temporarily and preventing Alex from teaching her charges new tricks. In the mammals department, monkey keeper Andrea is surprised to discover a newborn baby in the colobus enclosure. Elsewhere, butterfly keeper Mark is helping rare species hatch, bird keeper Adrian tries to rein in his naughtiest penguin, and reptile keeper Ian welcomes back Tank, the giant Aldabran tortoise who is ZSL's oldest animal.
