,nakislive,2012-08-11T00:04Z,"THANK YOU. BUT PLEASE TELL US.
WHAT IS THE SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE TO USE TO UNCOMPRES THAT PAK'S?"
,El_Kabong1,2012-08-11T00:18Z,"Only 90% downloaded, but alarm bells going off:

ISO image contains 'setup.exe' and 800+ .PAK files - WTF? This is *not* the way to share image files.

Has anyone checked this out yet? If so, please let us know what you have."
,El_Kabong1,2012-08-11T01:01Z,"OK, finished the download. 
Mounted the ISO. 
Read the 'readme.txt' file - it's in Russian. 
Ran the setup.exe program (in a Windows XP VM, not risking my working OS) and got the message 'Windows Vista/7 only'.

Not good. I'll see if there's any way to unpack the PAK files, but I'm not optimistic."
,viniro,2012-08-11T01:03Z,"it's ok, this is FastStone Image Viewer v4.6 license

look readme.txt"
,El_Kabong1,2012-08-11T01:11Z,"No luck - none of my archive programs will read the PAK files and didn't find anything useful on google.

@jerrykk88 - your previous upload was good and much appreciated. What on earth are you trying to do with this one?"
,unreal,2012-08-11T03:21Z,smells like one big trojan!!
,mwyoung,2012-08-11T08:16Z,"These are NOT VALID PAK FORMAT FILES...

So, you put this shit out there and then tell every one to FUCK OFF by not explaining why it is NOT what you say it is.

WE will not forget you..."
,jerrykk08,2012-08-11T13:14Z,use unpaker on disk / it's work
,jerrykk08,2012-08-11T13:17Z,can make of copy..
,nakislive,2012-08-11T15:04Z,"jerrykk08 Why you make an upload using a software that you don't give it in your torrent.
you give fast stone software and not the unpacker.
are you trying to accomplished something?
Is there anyone that use this unpacker and work for him?????"
,jerrykk08,2012-08-11T16:58Z,I downloaded a paid copy of the disc. Why spend too much space on your hard drive?
,viniro,2012-08-11T17:34Z,author! you where you take an exclusive? GIVE ELSE? I would have for a long time licking those pussies!
,viniro,2012-08-14T16:03Z,it's good
,El_Kabong1,2012-08-15T23:44Z,"I still can't get the images. The setup.exe program only works with Windows Vista/7. I've tried every other option I can think of but no luck.

Has anybody been able to unpack the files in WinXP / OSX / Linux? If so, please help!

TIA"
