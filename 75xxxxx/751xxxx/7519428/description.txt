PLOT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shakes plods about his duties as party clown, and uses all of his free time 
getting seriously drunk. Binky, another clown, wins the spot on a local kiddie 
show, which depresses Shakes even more, and his boss threatens him with 
unemployment if he can't get his act under control. When someone murders Shakes' 
boss and makes it look like Shakes did it, he goes undercover, posing as a 
hated mime, and tries to find information that will clear his name.
