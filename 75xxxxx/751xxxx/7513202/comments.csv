,clear009,2012-08-08T02:34Z,One more thing. If anyone has a problem running it from the folder let me know and I will upload the game exactly as it would be on a cd so you can install it yourself.
,clear009,2012-08-08T03:43Z,PLEASE SEED... As soon as someones download completes they delete it and I'm wasting alot of my monthly bandwidth... Tanks!!!!
