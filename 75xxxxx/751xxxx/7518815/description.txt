What to do if it doesn't work ?

- Be patient. Do not take drugs
- Make sure you ran it as Administrator (Right Click 'Run As Administrator')
- The KMS server might be down, more servers will be included in future releases
- Make sure you have the proper KMS key that you need installed, more keys and auto OS detection will be added in future releases
- Getting error saying something about non-core, you're inserting a key not for your version
- If you have any other issues, post below
Note* if this version doesnt work, be sure to set the date/time/time zone correctly.. Smile
and try again (and also try with v.1.1 also)
