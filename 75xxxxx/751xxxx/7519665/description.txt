This is a self=extracting RAR file containing all the needed XP drivers fro a Compaq Presario R4000 laptop.All the drivers were gotten from the HP/Compaq Driver support website.Includes audio,Wireless,WIFI,LAN,Video and BIOS updates.

I got these after the men who installed a new Heat Pump at my sister's home, had their Laptop go down because of a bad Hard drive.Upgraded the HD,RAM and reinstalled XP,which needed all the drivers to function correctly.
