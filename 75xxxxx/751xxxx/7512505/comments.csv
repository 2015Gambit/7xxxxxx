Die in a fire."
,Machine4578,2012-08-08T00:39Z,"OmniNegro is 100% correct!!! this uploader injects viruses into his torrents by modifying the iso file!!!!!

 BEWARE TO ALL WHO HAVE DOWNLOADED THIS.

He is trying to trick people that this is extremezone's torrent by adding the piratpedia sucks.txt with his virus filled iso but if you do a 1:1 check of the md5's compared to the real extremezone file they are different.. 
P.S. YOU are one son of a bitch blackBear2 and I hope you BURN IN HELL"
