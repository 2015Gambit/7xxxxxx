The Comedy Central/Viacom Flash Player is just a mess, I sometimes get advertisements twice, they are at 150% volume etc etc. Too sad that viacom is still refusing to adopt a modern form of web distribution, whilst VTV is strictly orientated after the users satisfaction. And that from a noble sharing motivation! WE DON'T NEED NO MONEY LET THAT MOFO BURN!"
