,_boeder,2012-09-09T02:31Z,"NOT 720p but decent quality for the size. I can't believe only one person noticed that the video/audio are OUT OF SYNC. This is trademark CharmeLeon, I had the same problem on his ""Vicky Donor"" torrent. The encoding is garbage!"
,neel101,2012-09-09T07:23Z,i really appreciate your work.....but pls dont let the quality be degraded for a little less size....in this movie.....things blur when some object moves....and audio and video are a little out of sync...so pls have a look...
