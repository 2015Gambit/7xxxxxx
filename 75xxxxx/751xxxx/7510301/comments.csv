,jmcc84,2012-08-07T00:10Z,is there a way to activate it already? how can i do it?
,brucie36,2012-08-07T01:02Z,"This activation method is for 180 days only! It means you have to rearm it every 6 months or until a better activation method comes up in the next few weeks. Good luck!

1. Install Win8 offline.
2. Start Windows.
3. Set the time properly according to your region. Additionally, click Internet Time tab > Change Settings > synchronize with ""time.windows.com"" > OK
4. Point your cursor to the lower left hand corner of the screen. Right click. Open CMD as Admin.
5. Type this (without the quotes): ""slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4""
6. Press Enter.
7. Type this (without the quotes): ""slmgr /skms kms-c.no-ip.org:1688""
8. Press Enter.
9. Type this (without the quotes): ""slmgr.vbs -ato""
10. Press Enter.
11. Click OK.
12. Restart your computer.
13. The End.

PS. Connect to the internet and download the updates that you want and hope to the fucking spaghetti monster that Steve Ballmer doesn't find you ;)

Sorry about that. The Russian KMS server went offline the whole day yesterday that is why you are getting that error.

Fortunately, the server went online just an hour ago. Repeat the step-by-step procedure in my first post and you're good to go.

I ran it in PEID and it is not packed.

I ran it in PeExplorer and nothing looks unusual.

So where are you getting your information from ?

Found th virus your self ?
Gimme the RVA where the malicious code starts and I'll debug it with OllyDBG or IDA and confirm..

Also its been stated publicly by W.Z.T
that when MSDN releases their images that none of the images from W.Z.T's RTM's releases are going to match.
This is no secret, Its a note from the releaser.

Just follow the instruction


 Clean Your DNS Cache

1) Open CMD with Admin rights.

 ipconfig /flushdns

2) Reboot system

3)Set TCP/IPv4 server addresses:

  Preffered DNS server: 8 . 8 . 8 . 8
  Alternate DNS server: 8 . 8 . 4 . 4

4). Restart the system. (restarting PC is important)

 5). Run cmd as administrator.

6) Enter following commands one by one: 

 slmgr.vbs -ipk ng4hw-vh26c-733kw-k6f98-j8ck4

 slmgr -skms benderrodriguez-1-pt.tunnel.tserv28.waw1.ipv6.he.net

 slmgr -ato 

Restart the system

it is done your computer will activate for 180 days,
if is not activated repeat last step again.

1.Do a clean install for phone activation.
2.Wait for a fucking solution e.g. STANDALONE KMS for windows 8 and likewise that would come in 100 years later. DAZ tool for windows 8 is impossible since since no master key ever existed and OEM uses unique key for every machine that has windows 8 installled.

REMOVE WAT method will not be possible in win8 even if you are able to remove activation, the shitty windows 8 will not going to work until it thinks it just activated. important/administrative settings in control panel will not be saved and reverted to default unless you had your copy activated now u see how smart Micro$hit preventing future version of REMOVE WAT."

on a lighter note, micro$hit is seriously winning at this very time over piracy. the so-called KMS Activator that has been floating around tpb isn't come to as far as at least a standalone KMS like the used to be KMS for OFFICE2010 and WINDOWS 7 enterprise. It is just a lame method of contacting kms servers via online. such pity since it never worked for fucker like me and the rest of fuckers who wont be buying the OS.

To clarify as well, when using Skype (I recommend this, as it's the only way to dial the UK number for Microsoft, you HAVE to dial UK number) you need to use the UK country code, aka 44.  So dial it like +44800018xxxx can't remember the rest, but you get the idea.  Got mine activated and running quite smooth ;) thanks Thumper, props to a legit torrent."

So I have Win 7 and Win 8 both, and it shows them and asks at boot.  As long as you have a separate partition ready, just select it, and the install disk does the rest.  Take in mind, this only works when you boot the DVD, NOT if you install while in existing OS."

As I don't have a mick, I pluged a earphone from my mobile on the pink slot (mick plug) and it work.
That's the only way to activate the keyboard on the skype.
Well done for everyone which has win8 activated.

Isso realmente funciona.
Como não tenho um microfone, eu conectei um fone de ouvidos do meu celular no slot rosa, (entrada p/ microfone) atrás do pc e funcionou.
Essa foi a única maneira de ativar o teclado no skype.
Parabéns a todos que tem o win8 ativado."

is the edition of Windows 8 the same on the desktop and laptop? not sure if this will work, but you can try this: on your desktop pc which is activated go to C:/Windows/System32/spp then copy the store folder and they try to paste that in the same directory on your wife's laptop. try to see if it gets activated."

,FuckSholihin,2012-08-30T00:31Z,"Sanitizer,

no you cannot try a different country only UK but some keys work for USA too.

as for the installation ID, better switch to another MAK key so it will definitely change the installation ID to a new one and less hassle than doing another fresh windows installation. more keys from either the previous comment from previous page# and also here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7542182/

sorry for my fucking enlish.

inferno,
finally, nice to know you finally activated. cheers:)"

,bebe407,2012-08-30T17:17Z,"How to activate your Windows 8 Pro:

 1. Run cmd as admin. Enter slmgr /ipk J7JBD-2NTPH-HXFHK-3FXFP-TMQG7 (Only for Pro)
 2. Turn off your internet connection
3. Open activation window and click ""Activate"". It'll show your an error.
 4. After that you'll see ""Activate by phone"" button.
 5. i chose united kingdom for the country, Call microsoft and enter code from message, which you will see.
 6. you should choose for personal, If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1

 this should work and your w8 should be activated for good. goodluck!

Pro: Your own unique key
Con: Spend $25
Pro: It won't be blacklisted like the ones being leaked on here and on Google, meaning you can reactivate it without the worry of it not working, it will always work so long as you don't share it with anyone.

Only one con I can think of lol

ls;dr

Wait for free keys, maybe get it activated for life, but if you ever need to format your PC and reinstall with that FREE key it will more than likely be blacklisted.

,hazeblaze420,2012-09-03T17:39Z,"Ok guys, after about 15 failed activation attempts over the last couple of days, I have finally been able to activate via the FulcrumX method. Everyone needs to give FulcrumX as he most likely has a life outside of this thread. His method works, nothing has changed about that and nothing will change about that. The only thing that will change is the validity of certain activation keys. That being said, it is important to note that the KMS servers for phone activation do go offline from time to time and you must be cognizant of the time-zones. I was able to activate on the UK server @ 10:30 AM Eastern Coast time from the US. When you call the UK server from the States, you must first dial out internationally, then dial the UK country code. The number you will call is 011-44-800-018-8354. Dial (1) for personal use, (#) to skip the rest of the prompts, and begin to enter the 9 blocks. The worked for me and the blocks I received are as follows:

1) Run CMD as Admin, and type:
slmgr /ipk TNHV9-74XMY-QVT69-CV8W6-RRDHC

2) You will receive a message that your key has been installed. Close the prompt. Hit (Windows key + R) and run ""slui 4""

3) Select the United Kingdom from the drop-down list and hit next.

4) The next screen will provide you with your 9 blocks. The ones I received were:
1 - 6608591
2 - 2734533
3 - 1437241
4 - 9971795
5 - 4937716
6 - 5862174
7 - 0873665
8 - 3201512
9 - 3368246

Use the phone method that I explained above and enter the blocks you are provided with.

5) After you have dialed your blocks, you will be asked how many computers this key has been installed on. I selected ""1"". Then you will be provided with the corresponding numbers for blocks ""A-H"". The ones I received were:

A - 402433
B - 822445
C - 921102
D - 197753
E - 920594
F - 894885
G - 370955
H - 260022

6) Click ""Activate"" and your Activation will be complete!!!!

7) Make sure you thank @FulcrumX.

If this does not work for you initially, don't worry, just keep trying different keys as they continue to be posted on this thread daily and eventually you will get it!!!

Big thanks to @FulcrumX for his diligence and patience with the THB community. It is very much appreciated."

,ow42x1,2012-09-06T05:48Z,If you still can't activate Windows 8 add me on Skype I still have many legit retail keys for sale that will activate your copy for life via the internet so you don't have to activate it via phone. ADD ME ON SKYPE: ow42x1
,JesterDev,2012-09-06T06:00Z,"It's really easy to activate. I did it myself with the following instructions and skype. To type the numbers in skype simply press the icons that looks like dots. Here is the number to call:

44-0 800 018 8354 - Follow prompts from recording. No live person to deal with.  

It's a toll free number so no charges apply, at least there was none for me from the US.

From @hazeblaze420 @fulcrumx

1. Press Winkey + R type in: slui 3 - enter product key. Press activate. Ignore the error, or any issues talking about the key being used to much, blocked etc. Don't worry about this. Just close the window.

2. Press Winkey + R type in: slui 4 
Select United Kingdom: Number again is: 

44-0 800 018 8354 

3. Dail the number in skype, or however you want. Enter the 9 blocks as asked to do so. 

4. You will receive blocks to full in black sections. 

5. Click ""Activate""

If your blocks are not valid, try another Key. 

You will not be talking to a human person, just a recording. "
,JesterDev,2012-09-06T06:03Z,"Black = Blank

Excuse the typos. :) 

dial 1 then the number: 

1 44 0 800 018 8354 "
