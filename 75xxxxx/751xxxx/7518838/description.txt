From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, August 9 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the latest news and hosts in-studio special guest reporter David Knight covering news of a federal appeals court upholding the creation of ΓÇ£no demonstration zones,ΓÇ¥ effectively prohibiting free speech in certain public areas. 

Alex also welcomes host of the Free Mind Report Holland Vandennieuwenhof.

Mr. Vandennieuwenhof dissects the history of government staged terror and exposes the telltale earmarks that give them away.
