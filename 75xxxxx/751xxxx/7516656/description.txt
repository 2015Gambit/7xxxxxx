"I'd do the same thing all over again, only I'd do it legal. I learned too late that you need just a good a brain to make a crooked million, as you need to make an honest million.

They fixed the World Series. They build Las Vegas. They terrorized America with their vicious murders and fearless robberies. They are men named Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Lucky Luciano, and Meyer Lansky.

The American Gangster tells the true story behind their ruthless rise to wealth and power. Filled with vintage film and actual photographs, it takes a gripping look at the birth of organized crime. From prohibition to prostitution, from gangland massacres to gambling empires, their most infamous deeds are chronicled in shocking detail. Even more explosive than the movies they inspired, such as Scarface and The Godfather, these are the true histories of the brilliant, brutal gangsters who turned the American Dream into an ongoing nightmare.
