,Tom5555,2012-08-07T19:24Z,Seriously? Zero replies to this amazing torrent? A WEB-DL version right after the broadcast. Just as I like it. It starts to look like the newsgroups. Thank you so much! I love this series!

FYI DibyaTPB, watch those IMMERSE releases. A lot of them have been truncated lately."
