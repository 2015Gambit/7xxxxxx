,ChillOutSurfing,2012-08-30T15:58Z,"Hi, just a quick comment, i realise that we can't really do a specific search on this certain item from this certain uploader, so i would like to request that comic uploaders please include the link for the previous and next issue's download link in the comment, that will certainly help alot! Just like New 52 Justice League, it's so darn hard to search for them and i still can't find it!!! Please consider my suggestion, thanks! and GREAT GREAT uploads from you."
