""My Father's Place"" was a club near NYC, USA which became legendary as a venue for groundbreaking new music.  Todd made frequent artistic contributions to the albums he produced.  XTC; SKYLARKING and the TUBES; REMOTE CONTROL albums come to mind. "

Meatloaf doesn't pull any punches,  he goes for the high notes just like on the album.  Great stuff,  thanks."
