Live from MY FATHER'S PLACE.....Roslyn NY (Long Island)..29-NOV-1977

Although these are EAC/WAV FLAC files there's quite a bit of generation loss here 

so don't be too critical of the sound quality which, quite frankly...sucks.

Pay attention instead to the guitar player who uses his flanger quite a bit.

The crowd is into it fully. The lyrics are somewhat modified from the LP 

release. 

I quite prefer this noisy archive recorded off the radio onto cassette tape 

in 1978 to the classic chart busting LP release.  My main reason for this judgement 

is that the producer of "Bat out of Hell" is probably playing guitar here....helping 

to promote the album.  I've found this recording on line elsewhere but I didn't

find Todd Rundgren credited with the lead guitar anywhere.



SO I ASKYA?

Is it Todd or is it not Todd?
