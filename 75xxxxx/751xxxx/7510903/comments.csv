RARed files are a poor reason to avoid downloading a file. I've never had any problem downloading sceneline files. 

I can't say anything about the rest of what you said, because I'd have to look into that for myself.

Seriously though, who at sceneline hurt your feelings, that you'd want to take the time to write all that hate towards them?"
