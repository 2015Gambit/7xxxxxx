,s_pljuc,2012-08-08T10:04Z,do you have a 32bit version?
,Blast_field,2012-08-08T20:32Z,"My apologies if you cannot download the torrent I uploaded earlier this morning.  Every time someone attempts to download my computer refuses the download request.  Yet, I downloaded a version of Systat from another torrent site and I can seed.  Systat and Matlab are stored in the same directory.  Please help.

Regarding the version, I only have the 64 bit version.

Sorry
