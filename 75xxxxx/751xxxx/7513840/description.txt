I included a zipped 64 bit version of Matlab r2009b.  In the event you do not have 7-zip, I included the setup for it.  I also included the setup for Virtual Clone Drive so you can mount your ISO, and an ISO burner. The PDF contains part of a blog from a member.  He/she provides a list of instructions for installing Matlab.  The final file is an MSWord doc that contains the File Installation Key (FIK) provided by this member.
