PC Tools File Recover v9.0.1.221 Multilingual-CRD ~HuNtEr~

Scene group CRD released the lastest version of File Recover. It is a safe, affordable and easy-to-use file recovery solution, designed to recover and restore deleted files from hard drives, floppy drives and other types of fixed media. File Recover allows you to recover critically important documents and other files that have been lost by accidental deletion. These files may be lost by emptying the Recycle Bin or using other deletion actions that bypass the Recycle Bi altogether. Such actions include Windows Shift-Delete, command line deletion, deleting excessively large files or using applications that delete files without the Recycle Bin. When a file is deleted from the Recycle Bin, or if the recycle bin is bypassed altogether, the file can no longer be recovered by the Windows Operating System. However, the content of the file still remains on the drive, relatively intact, until the section of the drive it occupies is overwritten by another file.
