,virtualmatrix258,2012-08-06T23:22Z,"Horrible quality...I won't even put a number on it. It's blurry 90% of the time, the audio sucks and it's filmed on a 30 degree angle. This retard must've used a goddamn potato to film this..."

enough for me,i think I'll wait to there's one filmed with a better cam or wait till DVD rip, looks like to good of a flick to suffer bad quality. but have to give props for all the hard work to all who clean up the cams to give us early flicks to watch, but some are just beyond help"
