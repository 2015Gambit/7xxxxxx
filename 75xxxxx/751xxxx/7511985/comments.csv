,epsilon_bel,2012-08-08T13:47Z,"anybody know how to get the enroute charts working in FD? Terminal charts work with no problem just the enroute part does not show.
I copied/replaced everything in the documents/data/Enroute folder.
Any idea?"

,Budah76,2012-08-09T13:06Z,"This is what I did to install Jeppview FD on iPad 3 (I will only describe FD because TC has been previously commented):
-Jeppview FD:
1.- Once downloaded this torrent, open the file, and select to 'copy' the subfolder ""data"" of the folder 'Documents' (all the folder 'data', not only the files of the subfolder termcharts), paste into the iPad using iExplorer, following this route: apps>jeppfd>documents (into this folder, in order to replace the old data folder).
2.- Be patient, the process takes almost 2 or 3 minutes. A good signal of a correct procedure is a multiple messages of 'would you like to delete xxxxx file?', of course, confirm all these messages.
3.- Once you've finished of copying the folder 'data', personally (but this's optional, but extremely recommended) I rebooted the iPad.
4.- Before opening the application JeppFD, go to Settings>Location and allow the use of GPS for the application.
5.- Open the application and enjoy of full world coverage.
6.- Just a little thing more, if you want to add VFR Charts, just copy only the files of the following torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7494859/Jeppview_Cycle_1216_VFR_charts_and_airportlist.dbf into the folder 'Termcharts' (as I mentioned before, confirm all the messages of deleting the old files contained into the folder).
I hope this would be useful for some of you. "

@uvmc
delete and reinstall the app again. after install, open app and play around the charts. do not close, then copy the files over. i use ifunbox. hope this works for u."
,epsilon_bel,2012-08-09T14:56Z,Thanks for the help guys but still no luck with the enroute charts. I am using version 1.1.0(101) of the app. Followed the instructions to the letter. TC charts are there but no enroutes.
,precursor1188,2012-08-09T15:53Z,"@epsilon
could it be that you are still on older ios version?"
,epsilon_bel,2012-08-09T16:33Z,On 5.0
,Razgriz.MX,2012-08-09T21:44Z,"@epsilon

I have issues with 1215, now with 1216 are all solved, i do the following: First unistall and install JeppFD, running one time, then without closing it, copy the contect of termchart overwritting all, then delelted the enroute folder, copy from the torrent via iExplorer, and then restart the app (i assume u know how rstart an app on iPad), then wuala!! work like a charm!!
Regards!!"
,JAB69,2012-08-10T08:56Z,PC version contains all needed data for PC and Mobile FD so would be a much better post that this patchwork
,precursor1188,2012-08-10T12:59Z,"@jab69
can the PC data updates Ipad FD enroute data?"
,JAB69,2012-08-10T15:07Z,"precursor1188: yes the PC version contains everything, with the PC version i update my laptop and my Mobile FD (terminal and enroute), the airports list is created with a small exe file that exists amongs previous post. In my view the ""iPad only"" posts are a waste of time and i dont trust them, they often contain errors and the aiports lists are often faulty. The 4Gb PC update sorts out all requirements."
,precursor1188,2012-08-10T16:08Z,"@jab69
I think most of us knows how to update the terminal charts using the pc data and some of us got the exe to create the airportlist. But I have not seen anybody providing the guide to do it with the enroute data. Can you enlighten us. I looked into the pc enroute data and the file names are different from the ipad FD. Only advantage of the Ipad data is that it comes in 14 days and the pc data comes in 28 days. Thanks."
,Budah76,2012-08-10T17:07Z,"@JAB69

what you are saying, sounds very interesting, could tell  us how to do that?. Thanks (please a little tutorial, how to create the airport list). "

,bar182,2012-08-13T08:37Z,some one have the PC codes?
,hellinero,2012-08-13T10:14Z,PC version please.....
,JWRBlack,2012-08-13T17:16Z,Easy guys. Word is that the original seeder on the 1216 pc version is traveling. Once he's home he should be able to upload faster. Also once it is fully seeded we should be able to get the codes.
