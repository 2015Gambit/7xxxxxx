Mahler's powerful Second Symphony has had many distinguished interpreters, notably among them Otto Klemperer. Klemperer recorded the work several times, most famously with soprano Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, mezzo-soprano Hilde Russl-Madjan and the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus in 1962. In this live, late-1960s recording (which I doubt you guess was recorded live), the tempos are a little quicker and the piece is perhaps a bit more dramatic. In any case, it's a stunning performance and was beautifully recorded. The disc is prized among collectors and is relatively rare. It was released as part of EMI's "Klemperer" Legacy series and went out of print after a relatively short time.
