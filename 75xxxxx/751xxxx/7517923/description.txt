In this original graphic novel, Batman meets his foe The Mad Hatter for the very first time - landing The Dark Knight in a Wonderland he could never have imagined, hot on the heels of a white rabbit.

But is this strange place real or a hallucination? Robin and Alfred believe he's deep in delirium - but if that's the case, how does he manage to resolve several mysteries that have plagued Gotham City for decades...

This fantastic tale is spun by renowned comics writer Bruce Jones (THE INCREDIBLE HULK) with surreal art by Sam Kieth (THE MAXX, BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM - MADNESS, 
LOBO).
