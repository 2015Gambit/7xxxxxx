Elsevier now offers a series of derivative works based on the acclaimed Meylers Side Effect of Drugs, 15th Edition. These individual volumes are grouped by specialty to benefit the practicing physician or health care clinician.

Herbal Medicines are popular with consumers and patients who often assume that they are natural and therefore safe. However, herbal medicines undoubtedly have adverse effects and patients often do not discuss their use of herbal medicines with their doctors, and the risks are not always addresses.

This book summarizes the adverse effects of a large range of herbal medicines and the active ingredients that they contain. It includes extensive lists of the families of plants that are used as herbal medicines, including the Latin names of genera and species as well as the common names of individual plants. It features not only herbal medicines but information on important compounds such as tropane alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, nicotine, and pyrolizidine alkaloids.

The material is drawn from the 15th edition of the internationally renowned encyclopedia, Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs, and the latest volumes in the companion series, Side Effects of Drugs Annuals.

This volume is critical for any health professional or homeopathic practitioner with an interest in herbal medicines.
