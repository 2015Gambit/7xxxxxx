I uploaded another torrent for this version of Matlab.  My hope is that you can now download it.  Before, the port was not open and piratebay was rejected as a tracker by my computer. I fixed the port problem and I think that the second is also fixed.  Hope you can download.  As before, I included a zipped 64 bit version of Matlab r2009b.  In the event you do not have 7-zip, I included the setup for it. The PDF contains part of a blog from a member.  He/she provides a list of instructions for installing Matlab.  The final file is an MSWord doc that contains the File Installation Key (FIK) provided by this member.
