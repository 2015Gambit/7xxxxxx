Resistance 3 Fix

This will work if you have either the US version or the EUR version, but if you have the US version it will now show as EUR version on
mM or any backup manager you are using, dont worry this is to get it working.

First and foremost you must delete all Resistance 3 DATA from your PS3, you might have installed some before while attempting to make it work,
we need to start from scratch so just follow the steps. Make sure you back up your original files (EBOOT and PARAM)

DOwnload the required files:

1- EBOOT.BIN, PARAM.SFO, 1.05 MODDED UPDATE (FIX) - all in torrent

2- Update 1.02

3- Update 1.03

4- Update 1.04  
http://b0.ww.np.dl.playstation.net/tppkg/np/BCES01118/BCES01118_T4/c58477cdab6b3977/EP9000-BCES01118_00-RESISTANCE300001-A0104-V0100-PE.pkg

5- Update 1.05  
http://b0.ww.np.dl.playstation.net/tppkg/np/BCES01118/BCES01118_T4/c58477cdab6b3977/EP9000-BCES01118_00-RESISTANCE300001-A0105-V0100-PE.pkg



First Replace the EBOOT and PARAM on your PS3_GAME and USRDIR Folders (Backup your originals)
Second is to install the updates in order (1.02, 1.03, 1.04, 1.05)
Last install the 1.05 Modded update (FIX)

If you followed this steps correctly it should run with no problems and istall Data while running some video explaining
the story.

I Followed this steps and the PARAM and EBOOT I posted are my own from my ripped original game.

Good Luck
