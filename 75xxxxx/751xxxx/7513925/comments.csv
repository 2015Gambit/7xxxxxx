,Urvek,2012-08-16T03:47Z,"Pretty solid overall - I was surprised, to be honest - I normally avoid anything that requires I read subtitles but this was pleasant. (Spacey fan, so mileage may vary)"
,GeorgeMak,2012-08-17T04:27Z,"@rush dude because i've seen a similar ""comment"" of yours in another film, i have a question. Why the fuck do you presume we give a rat's ass about the imdb. Honestly i have among my favorites films considered mediocre or bad by them. Why should anyone COMPLY and CONFORM to a bloody rating. That's sheep mentality something that this site stands against..."
