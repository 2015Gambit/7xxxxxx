,slowquin,2012-08-10T09:32Z,you can't delete torrent but you can stop seeding...
,5-click,2012-08-10T09:51Z,Still does not work? Previously you could even edit.
,slowquin,2012-08-10T10:31Z,they disabled both the edit and delete feature because if an acount gets hacked a person could lose all torrents and such. but the Mods on the forum will clear a hash and/or delete torrent if you have have a good excuse.
