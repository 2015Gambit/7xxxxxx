opinions that p2p and downloading arent as evil

OK many hit and runs and non sharers
happening

ive shared over ratio 2,0 now and over my data cap

hope the few left will KEEP it seeded for the
last few as THESE are worth the watch

and spread the counter views opposing gov and movie and music corruption taking away internet freedoms"
