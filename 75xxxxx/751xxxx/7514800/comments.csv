[H],shirepirate,2012-08-09T01:58Z,MKV files belong in the Video > Movies category. Your torrents were moved and once again please post in the correct category
,asdfkjjj,2012-08-09T12:15Z,"not to mention the size of the MKV,  must be a high res movie right? Wrong cat again. Upper should post information on the files like resolution. -1"
,AFSCN,2012-08-10T15:15Z,"DVD to MKV with no audio or video changes, i figured most people would understand (720x480) reso, DD 5.1 and or DD 2.0 Audio...

The size varies from each movie, extra features included and audio quality from each release.

Will remember to post in Movies section, was incorrectly told a while back to upload in DVDR section, my first uploads on TPB were under the Movies section."
