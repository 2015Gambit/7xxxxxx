[V],Nepotu,2012-08-08T02:09Z,"It's soccer, like americans use to say. In the rest of the world it says football because it plays only with that part of human body who it calls foot. Football (in american way) it plays an insignificant part of the time with the foot (I don't know why it calls like that) and it isn't an olympic sport. I have nothing against this sport, only against the name, because it isn't a foot-ball, it is a hand-ball or a hand-foot-ball. :)"
,fabricio-os,2012-08-08T03:07Z,"""american football"" is a gay version of Rugby and shouldnt be called football it should be called ""gay rugby"""
,smokkedog2,2012-08-08T05:29Z,You have to be a superMAN to play american football kid. Rugby is for for girly men.
,smokkedog2,2012-08-08T05:30Z,"Thanks for this nepotu, I hope you are gonna finish seeding the mexico game. We are all stuck at 95%."
,carliment,2012-08-08T10:34Z,"To be fair Nepotu, the term soccer was created by the English in the 1800's as an abbreviation of association football as to not confuse it with the many other games of ""football"" that were played at the time, mainly rugby football.  So as a result of that many of the old English colonies use the term soccer as well as football.  No Idea why American football is called that, maybe because the ""ball"" used in the game resembles a foot more than an actual ball."
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-08T11:57Z,Thank you and you are all welcome! Is not my fault for the stuck. Is the ripper's fault. @carliment: thank you for the decent explanation.
