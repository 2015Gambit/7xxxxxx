At turns, a transgressive artist in the purest sense of the term, the spiritual son of Kenneth Anger and John Waters, or leader of the Queercore movement, one thing is certain : Bruce LaBruce makes small budget movies full of hardcore sex, political messages and containing as much violence as tenderness, in which he happily crushes any gay attitude clich√©s while practicing ironic self glorification, mocks any horror movie or dramatic set ups, and avoids all fashionable art trends. Bruce maddens, irritates, enchants, charms, fascinates and mostly keep the LaBruce mystery very much alive.

The Advocate for Fagdom unites the puzzle pieces one by one. Testimonies are combined with rare archive images. Writers, film makers, art galery owners, actors and actresses, photographers, producers, friends and loved ones all join in a game of interpretation, analysis or simple anecdotes. John Waters, Bruce Benderson, Harmony Korine, Gus Van Sant, Richard Kern, Rick Castro and others deliver their impressions, theories and confessions. Everything blends into the fascinating portrait of a singular person blessed with singular talents. A complex personality at war not with a system but all systems. The portrait of a man constantly moving between his punk attitude and extreme sensibility.
