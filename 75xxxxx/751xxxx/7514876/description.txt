A truly great old release if you are into traditional rock and roll.   Marshall has been an extremely good interpreter of that "vintage sound", the stuff out of the late 50's and early 60's that made rock and roll a radio staple.   One of our modern day masters of the 3 minute rock and roll radio song.   Don't miss this one.
