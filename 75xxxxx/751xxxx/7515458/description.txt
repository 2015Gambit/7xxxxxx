*NOTE:  This venue only held 700 people, but someone printed at least 
300 counterfeit tix.  It was so crowded that I could pick BOTH feet off
the floor.  The band was pouring with sweat (along with everyone at the 
show), but somehow they managed to pull off a really long show.  I remember
John Bell leaning off the stage soaked and had this evil grin on his face
during parts of the show.  Definitely my favorite Panic show that I've
been to.
