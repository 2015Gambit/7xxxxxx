My 1st suite of software, it contains the first version of my browser, brawza and my calculator. As this is the 1st version, it is basic, but you will find them useful. Please leave comments below, or on my Facebook Wall. 

I will issue manual updates every few months. for this you will first have to find it either by searching TPB with the following keywords:
iChallenge, Utilities, 1.0, Brawza 1.0, Calculator 1.0 or iChallenge Utilities 1

or by following the link i will post as a comment here and on my Facebook Wall. Also, you will have to uninstall the software before you can install the updated version.

PLEASE SEED, AND Enjoy
