went through the tracks quickly (will enjoy them later), quality seemed great."
,autumn81,2012-08-07T21:38Z,Thanks for stealing this record.  They're not on a major label anymore so your only hurting the band.  They appreciate it I'm sure.  Fucking pieces of shit
,Jacksn87,2012-08-08T01:13Z,"Oh get the fuck over yourself Autumn. No one is trying to hear that shit. Great band, quality is high, ID tags are legit, great upload."
,ialeixo,2012-08-08T02:51Z,"Jacksn87

Actually, autumn has a point....."
,Jacksn87,2012-08-08T05:53Z,"Yeah, alright, I might have been unfair. I apologize. I guess it just struck me as odd seeing that post pointing out the flaws of bootlegging music on a site that deals exclusively with intellectual property. My bad, sorry Autumn. "
,Hottwing,2012-08-08T06:07Z,"@Autumn

I understand where you're coming from. But ranting about something like that on a massive site of people who do this everyday, isn't going to get you anywhere. So basically what I'm saying is fuck off or calm down, you're influencing NOBODY. You have an account on pb, so i'm going to assume you have torrented something atleast, which means you have stolen something too. Please, be a hypocrite somewhere else."
,ps2player4u,2012-08-08T13:15Z,"Thanks all!, Glad you're enjoying

There are three songs missing from this album that was released on the deluxe edition.

- Baptized In Fire
- Backlash Acoustic Version
- Soma Acoustic Version

Anyways, I wanted to comment and let everyone know

And please take the arguing elsewhere. This is for commenting on the Torrent, not for discussing or arguing what is right or wrong. "

Wrong. I started this profile to comment on here. Whether you want to believe it or not I play in 10 Years. My name is Lewis and I would be more than happy to discuss this with you at a show. We are not on a major label any more. We put our own money up for this project. You call yourself ""fans"" and you STEAL what we worked so hard to create for you.  It cost us a lot of money to do this. We built a studio with our OWN money. We are marketing this with our OWN money. This is how we make a living and we are not millionaire contrary to popular belief that all ""rock stars"" are millionaires.  Again I don't care if you don't think this is me but I have made my point. Keep stealing and we'll stop making records. I can guarantee that. "
,autumn81,2012-08-08T15:37Z,The major label system is flawed. They make millions and pay the artist nothing. Steal from them and bring them down. Don't bring the artist down. Your only hurting yourself
,GoBlue03,2012-08-09T03:56Z,"@autumn81 

U MAD BRO?

I digress...you kept saying they/them/they're then you say your in the band, never once mentioning our/my album. Come on man! 

Yeah I'm in the band too my name is Tater."
,GoBlue03,2012-08-09T03:59Z,"Not saying your argument is wrong or that this isn't right, but come on."
,autumn81,2012-08-09T04:21Z,Oh yea goblue?  Go check the 10 Years twitter. I left you a message. 
,GoBlue03,2012-08-09T05:58Z,"Haha. Well, I  was wrong on you actually being in the band. 

Never said that this was right, only questioned your validity. "
,Mock00,2012-08-09T05:59Z,"I have to say, this is probably the last thing I expected to see when I checked the comment section on this torrent.

Autumn - I've been a 10 Years fan from the very beginning (cough before TAE cough), and I've bought the albums, caught every show I can manage to make, and have a few shirts. I'm in love with the new material.  That said, I don't see where coming on here and arguing with people is going to help anything. Hell, it might put some people off from going out and buying the album when they're already here to torrent it (for anyone wondering, Best Buy has it for $8 right now). You'll catch more flies with sugar than you will spitting in their face and calling them ""fucking pieces of shit"", regardless of how (maybe validly) you feel that way.

Just my two not-really-all-that-important (but it's the internet, so what the hell?) cents."
,Mock00,2012-08-09T06:01Z,"And because it took out my ""self-righteous super fan"" self-jab (can you not put things in brackets?), I want to do my best to not come off as such a prick...so I'll mention it again. ;)"
,autumn81,2012-08-09T06:48Z,"You know what man I'm tired of everyone making excuses about losing fans and what not. Why don't you walk into a record store, take our record off the shelf, and walk out the door with it. See how that works out for you. I'm glad you've come to shows and bought shirts and what have you. But I'm sure if there was a way for people to steal our Merch and tickets to shows they would do it just the same.  Again we aren't millionaires and try our best to maintain artist integrity and honesty in our music.  The exact reason we started our own label and took the road less travelled.  If this pisses people off I don't give a fuck. When you steal our music your not a fan your a thief.  I don't sugar coat this topic so if people don't want to listen to us over this than so be it.  Our record hadn't been out for 8 hours before I saw some asshole upload it and make it available for the world to steal. It's just bullshit.  "
,24indria,2012-08-09T18:49Z,"I apologize autumn if you are who you claim to be.  In the age of artists/studios shelling out garbage to the consumers I have taken it upon myself to invest my money more wisely.  Should the album be as good as all of 10 Years' prior albums I will be purchasing it right away, however, if I don't like the album I will delete it never to listen to it again and the artist/studio will not get my money.  It's too bad more people don't do the same...  Maybe we would have a lot less auditory vomit running amok. "
,mglimpse2,2012-08-10T08:22Z,"LOLumad?

it's a shame everyone (including myself) is stealing this cd cause its really REALLY friggin good. I posted Division about 4 years ago. I think the only real 10 years cd I've purchased was TAE. If you guys weren't such arrogant assholes to your fans at shows then maybe your record label wouldn't have dropped you and you could spend your money other ways. And by the way you say you arent millionares... oh honey. If you woulda saved your money like your mommy and daddy taught you, youd be millionares. so im not hearing that bologna. "
,dannydro,2012-08-11T12:19Z,"I consider myself to be a true fan I bought the cd and have a receipt to prove it. Comon guys its 10 bucks at best buy,support real music. I myself did have to test the cd out 1st as you would any thing. If you like it buy the fucking cd .10 bucks votes for more REAL MUSIC to be made.


"
,Programmor2012,2012-08-13T23:08Z,"@autumn81

What of those of us who don't have the extra $8 to spend on your album? Those of us who would rather put food in our children's mouths and live paycheck to paycheck to make it in this shithole of an economy. Would you deny us listening to your music just because we don't have the ability to pay for every cd you release? 

I have bought every album with the exception of Minus The Machine. Recently I have had surgery on my heart and had a pacemaker installed and am trying to support my family and pay off medical bills. And you would talk down to me because I have downloaded your music because I can't afford to spend money on the album?

I understand you aren't made of money, but keep in mind a majority of your fanbase are fans just like myself struggling day to day who have to download a copy because we can't afford a legit copy. So before you decided to rant and rave think about your fans and what some of them may be going though before you decided to judge. "

,shtupnob,2012-08-13T23:23Z,@autumn.... if you really are lewis... who is roach then?? You would have to know who he is.. 
,kreyvic,2012-08-17T23:22Z,Thanks for the upload!!!
,Hottwing,2012-08-20T06:46Z,"@Autumn (Supposedly Lewis (bullshit))

Hah, you think you can just come to a torrent site and troll saying you're in the band and want people to stop? LOL, man I've been rickrolled in my days pretty bad, but that's ridiculous. My statement still stands from before. And you're Lewis Cosby? Ok sure, well I'm you're previous label's owner, please please come back to us!"
,trhauser,2012-08-21T04:04Z,"LOL @ I'm in the band...

Palehorse which is 10 Years current label, which the own...  Is part of Warner Bros.  Hardly a small label...  How ever, bands make most of their money doing gigs and selling merch...  Music is just a means to do such..."
,Middge,2012-08-21T21:56Z,You guys do realize that that probably really was Lewis Cosby. Read all his comments and look at 10 years Twitter for August 8th.
,trhauser,2012-08-21T22:38Z,"Well if it was, then he needs to realise that I discovered 10 Years by downloading their albums, which I ultimately purchased...  And he then has to understand that calling people pieces of shit isn't the way to go either...   Kinda sad that he doesn't have better things to do with his time other than police the internet...  But hey, whatever helps him sleep at night.  Simply put, there is no such thing as bad exposure, even if you're album is being downloaded online..."
,zeWeaver,2012-08-25T05:37Z,"Figures the bass player, the most negligible member of any band has time to bitch and moan. 

Torrent quality is good, different from old 10 years music, not to say is bad but not what I was expecting.
"
,AwwwSnap,2012-09-08T01:07Z,"Autumn, if you're really Lewis...go worry about your wife and kid. You know you don't make your money from album sales. Your income is from the Merch and shows. Now go back to signin titties, gettin wasted, and sleep it off in the trailer.  I don't see your other band mates getting their panties in a twist. "
