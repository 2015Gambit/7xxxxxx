Also, folks who require ENG subtitles, I read somewhere the movie is (titled) about a little song that one of the characters sings at the beginning , for which the srt accompanying this DL doesn't have the translation. There are many srt files out there with varied/no translation but I found the below one most suitable cos it appears perfectly in sync and seems to have the translation for that song (Cant verify if its accurate cos I dont speak Japanese). Try it if you think it appropriate:
