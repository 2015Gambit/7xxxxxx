Photomatix
 
Create stunning photographs of high contrast scenes
 

Have you ever photographed a high contrast scene? If so, you know that even the best exposure gives you blown out highlights, or flat shadows, or both. The solution is High Dynamic Range (HDR) processing: 

Take multiple photographs at varying exposure levels
 
Merge the photos into an HDR image 

Adjust the settings to get the look you want: from natural-looking with Exposure Fusion to painterly or surreal with Tone Mapping
 

Photomatix Pro and Photomatix Essentials are stand-alone programs running on Windows and Mac OS X.
 
Photomatix Essentials focuses on simplicity and easy of use. Photomatix Pro offers more option and includes advanced features such as batch processing and selective deghosting, as well as a Lightroom Plug-in.
