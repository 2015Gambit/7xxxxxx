,Seefer,2012-08-29T08:00Z,"If you smoke cigs and drink alcohol, its the same shit. Who grew hemp in american culture? George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe and Andrew Jackson to list a few. 

The paper industry profited from making Hemp illegal, as it was generally cheaper to use hemp rather than shaving down a tree that has been around for 40+ years. "

,EliteBeast,2012-08-29T22:58Z,"not a movie, not a play, not even stand up comedy. Just 2 losers talking about nothing. The last 8 minutes was amusing though."

,YardBoy,2012-08-30T03:38Z,"+1 to the UL'er and other contributors.
Re-paid in kind 4.73X.  You?
This isn't a movie, it's more of a symposium:
Kevin and Jason sitting at a table on stage in front of a live London audience.  It was funny to a degree."
,duke1976,2012-08-30T13:33Z,"EliteBeast, if you think Kevin and Jay are LOSERS, why the fuck did you download one of their DVDs???????

To the rest of you worthless fuckheads.......HOW COULD YOU THINK THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MOVIE????? Kevin has been doing live shows live this for years!!! Are you all brain dead?? You all act like you never heard of his live shows before. He has even released TWO other DVDs with live shows just like this. Jesus Christ, you all are idiots."
,mac_user777,2012-08-30T15:15Z,"MOVIE = SHIT-one big pile of smelly poo,If you watched Clerks or Mallrats it really will disappoint you,they don;t even stand up,their just epically boring MOVIE Negative-10 "
,vatel88,2012-08-30T19:13Z, Downloading something and having expectations without knowledge and then getting upset after the fact is like eating a shit sandwich and getting surprised it takes like shit. Open your eyes before you open your mouths! 
,Fritz.,2012-08-31T05:20Z,"@seefer preaching about things doesnt change the fact that drugs are illegal and drug tests can get you fired or prevent you from getting a decent job.

however i do know for a fact that if people remain sober they will be sharper and more intelligent than when they get intoxicated, even occasionally. there is a big difference between a person who has been sober for a couple days and someone who has been sober for months.

on a personal note though i dont really care if you want to do drugs so can get wasted and laugh at moronic things. It doesnt really affect me at all, so do whatever you want.

when you look around at upper educated professionals the vast majority of them are sober almost all the time. the proof is in the pudding so to speak."
,tkeys356,2012-08-31T10:04Z,Watching this high makes time fly by
,ThxAlways,2012-08-31T12:52Z,"@ Fritz, ""upper educated professionals"" are infested with the dreaded money bug and ""if we're over generalizing"" I would say they are the reason this once beautiful world is now a slow dying shithole. So you have that life and let everyone one else have theirs...."
,tiz2,2012-08-31T14:44Z,"@ Fritz: You know nothing for a fact. Lots of smart people have taken drugs. You should get high tonight, sobriety clearly isn't helping you."
,J3rryKo42O,2012-08-31T16:41Z,"@Fritz the only person preaching stupidity here is you. you are clearly an uneducated american. Go spew some hypocritical garbage somewhere else.

Thank fucking god im Canadian."
,J3rryKo42O,2012-08-31T16:53Z,STOP DELETING MY COMMENTS THEPIRATEBULLSHIT.SUCHMYCOCK
,FenrirsWrath,2012-09-01T09:06Z,"@Fritz every ""upper educated professional"" I know is either addicted to painkillers,prostitutes or a raging alcoholic. Maybe you need to open your eyes."
,krill123,2012-09-01T15:02Z,"thanks @ scene4all for great upload.

@trollz commenting here - stop fighting girls. 
Turn off computer and go do your nails/wash your hair."
,zooski,2012-09-01T22:51Z,Terrible movie! Don't waste your time!
,balrog814,2012-09-02T14:44Z,"Lafresh, you got some balls, writing here, that you have drugs. This site is watched by the police too, and they can surely track you down. Aren't you afraid?? I advise you to be more careful, man! BTW some drugs are really delicious :)"
,balrog814,2012-09-02T14:51Z,"@fritz. U 17 year old little douche, R U still alive? 3 months ago, the last time I was here, you were the stupidest entity on TPB. Those 1000's you pissed off, haven't killed you yet? "
,arakasi,2012-09-03T20:02Z,Hah! To anyone who thinks you can't use drugs and still be smart go research Carl Sagan.
,PurityDeath,2012-09-04T05:06Z,"I read everyone's comments that it was boring but DL'd it anyways because I really like these two guys. I'm glad I did, that was fucking funny. For what it is, just a sit down bullshitting it was really good. I'd give it an 8. Not hysterical but laugh out loud funny a lot of the time."
,joegreg13,2012-09-04T20:06Z,it's a tour dvd
,bvickery,2012-09-05T09:40Z,"balrog814  You are dumb.....if those cops or ""whoever"" were watching this site and could crack you down dont you think that people would get busted for all the Pirating going on here?  I am smoking weed and smoking some pur. And I am compleatly confident that NOTHING will happen as a result of this text. "
,balrog814,2012-09-05T13:01Z,"Vickery, smoke less. It might have made you miss getting the jokes:) I was just trolling you dippedwit:)"

,Shadow_Dwellis,2012-09-07T10:50Z,"Commenting about drugs guys.....come on.I'd rather read what quality this is and if it's worth downloading or not, I think you all are a bunch of dip shit's commenting about drugs and cops, grow up people!

Oh except the guys commenting about the download itself........Thank you :)."
,ust2,2012-09-10T06:06Z," Aw damn I got so excited when I seen this on here, never seen or heard anyting before now and thought it was actually gonna be another jay&silent bob movie :("
,jfhjr,2012-09-11T08:24Z,Ugh - more of the whoring of KS and JM - same old stories they've been telling for 15 years. I can barely watch Clerks anymore. No thanks. A/V great - movie? Fail.
,Frank525,2012-09-11T21:16Z,This is mostly Jay trying to tell bad stories while Kevin occasionally interrupts to say something funny/interesting. They admit at the end that Kevin is doing this to try to keep Jay off drugs.  
,EXE_cutioner,2012-09-14T00:12Z,This was sad! Old comics should just slip away quietly like old models!
