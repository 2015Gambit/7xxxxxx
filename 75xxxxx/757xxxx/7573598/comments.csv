,vujkee,2012-08-31T02:04Z,"i downloaded game, installed it with no problems...but now problems come...1. When i hit ""Esc"" button inside game it closes the game. 2. When i shoot or fight sometimes it glitches my commands and he start running around like crazy. 3.When i shoot sometimes i cant aim, and suddenly he change aim position so fast i cant even see it. 4. I come to the mission for police, drug location or something, and when i come to location, black screen pops, and exit game. This is most anoying game i have ever played, so not good work black box!!"
