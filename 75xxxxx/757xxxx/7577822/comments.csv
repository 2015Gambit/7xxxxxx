,ALAINPAIN,2012-08-28T14:06Z,BOZX- you are spoiling us again - i think this must be the remastered version that was recently re released - thank you 
,pjones452,2012-08-28T14:18Z,great work! Do you have the 3D version yet? And I believe snow white and the huntsman should be available today that would be great if you had it up today. thank you!!
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-28T14:59Z,IMBD states aspect ratio to be 1.78:1. In the description it's 2.35:1. Is the picture cropped from the top and bottom on this upload?!
,kelleytoons,2012-08-28T15:19Z,"As nice as this is that it's available, I'm holding out for a 1080 version."
,wise_pirate,2012-08-28T15:35Z,"AR to be 1:85 to 1 according to Amazon pre-order page for both new BR versions, which is still different from 2.35 to 1.  However, previous versions had been released in 2:35 to 1 format.  So, it's a bit intriguing to say the least..."
