This book was a favourite growing up.   So last year, I bought the book, scanned in, and created the ebook.  It was originally posted on Demonoid.  Since of the Demonoids demise, I have decided to repost on PirateBay. 

So for any fans of Encylopedia Brown, you might like this.  Plus some sad news just found out the the author Donald J. Sobol died on July 11th, 2012.  So this post is dedicated to the wonderful children's author who entertained and mystified many young kids with his books.  

Rest in Peace.
