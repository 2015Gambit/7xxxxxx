Not worth the download for me"
,Chugalugg,2012-08-26T09:46Z,"Felidae17, Think before you type! This is version 1.07 the very latest, not 1.01 or 1.02. Great up nam, thanks."
,Felidae17,2012-08-26T11:20Z,Sorry for the mistake.
,Night_Flyer,2012-08-26T12:19Z,Thank you !!!
,Jikul,2012-08-26T13:55Z,Thanks for the upload namco. Unfortunately I'm having a bit of a problem: my PFD and MFD screens are completely black. Any idea on how to solve this?
,Chugalugg,2012-08-26T18:01Z,"Jikul, First, do a complete uninstall of the Mustang. Then Follow the read me instructions exactly.  At the end when you apply the patch, you will command it twice as, there are 2 dll files that need replacing, mstngsvc, mstng. Have the patcher load them to your Desktop. Then place the mstng into the flight1_garminG1000_AUX folder, which is inside the FSX Gauge folder, overwrite the original dll. Then place the mstngsvc dll directly into the FSX Gauge folder itself, overwrite original Dll and your done."

,Jikul,2012-08-26T22:11Z,"Thanks Chugalugg, I was putting both files on the Gauges folder. It's working fine now."
,Taco92,2012-08-26T23:26Z,Thank you very much!!
,teekster,2012-08-27T06:30Z,a multitude of malware inf related files are now on your computer in many various locations of your windows program data folders if you ran the path.exe file included in this rar. tsk tsk...run your scanners on path.exe for heavens sake
,namco-nexgen,2012-08-27T14:03Z,"Of course it has ""trojans""... Think for a bit, it's a damned patcher which antivirus love to label as malware."
,teekster,2012-08-27T14:32Z,"if you carefully read what I said then you'd understand that ""patchers"" do NOT do what I say it's doing. Good luck with that."
,teekster,2012-08-27T14:47Z,"tell ya what then...why don't you simply repack this without the ""path.exe"", and instead simply include the 2 dll files that it gives you to overwrite. Because this patcher is not simply a patcher...it is installing all sorts of shit on your machine that it should NOT be installing simply to give you 2 dll gauge files."
,aarque,2012-08-27T14:57Z,"teekster, you are a tweakster. Go figure, namco-nexgen spent nearly nine months establishing an esteemed reputation for the microscopic Pirate Bay FSX sim community by uploading quality software, just so he could zing the few hundred of us with this latest up? Not terribly ambitious for a hacker, might you agree?
 Go smoke some more crack, then click on his name, click on each torrent, read the comments, then come back here and tell us what a fool you've been. "
