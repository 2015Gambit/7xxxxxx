,skoxpress,2012-08-27T03:05Z,How exactly does that work ? The mat files are .emf and these .jpg's aren't going to show. 
,skoxpress,2012-08-27T03:16Z,"I see...I was looking in ""Presets"" instead of ""Edit"" column.  Double click in the Diffuse slot and then load from file.

Thanks for the heads up."
,skoxpress,2012-08-27T03:51Z,"Wow-what a trip! You find your ""Models"" file. Mine was D/users/myname/My Documents/VideoCopilot/
and load the files there.
  The models show up in the ""Model Browser"" and from the ""Edit"" column double click on ""none set"" and get the material by clicking down arrow and ""Load from File.."""
,kostandinangjellari,2012-08-27T10:27Z,Yeah I think it was many times easier than finding a crack..

,skoxpress,2012-08-31T02:31Z,A better question is why the 100 leeches  aren't seeding. 
,Patil92,2012-08-31T05:58Z,"Where Are the seeders.......
Please seed....."
,r3dr00m,2012-08-31T18:10Z,"can we get someone to seed? it's stuck on 99.3%. I don't mind seeding myself, but need to have it first. "
,theblackthumb,2012-08-31T23:32Z,He needs to enable initial seeding :
,r3dr00m,2012-09-01T00:38Z,"Leech my pretties, LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!! I fiexed for all of us:) You are all welcome. "

,r3dr00m,2012-09-01T01:14Z,"@kostandinangjellari,

I've fixed this torrent, but I can see all the leechers that were crying to seed are finished downloading and are gone:)"
,epicshit,2012-09-01T04:24Z,"anybody know how to get this to work correctly?

In the ""Presets"" box to the left, I get ""Pro_Shaders"" (a blue folder) and ""Pro_Shaders_maps"". If I click the blue folder, it says that it's unregistered. If I go into the Pro_Shaders_maps"" folder, I get the materials with the jpgs applied, however, they don't have any other settings applied - everything is just the default. Is this what everybody else is getting?"
,kay1124,2012-09-04T14:28Z,"thanks kostandinangjellari

but still few files are missing...like in kramer's metal folder shows 32 files where as here it only shows 22 files...
