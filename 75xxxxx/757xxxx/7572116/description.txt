Steven Wright Live 1985...A VHS Rip so the quality is low at best, but still worth 

the download to hear the one liners from this funny, stone-faced man.



Steven Wright must be one of the most unique comedians of our time. His humor is 

dry, clean, and different from the storytelling comedy stylings of George Carlin, 

Robin Williams, Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, and the others. I still use some of his 

"quips" all the time. 



Especially:  "I like to leave messages before the beep." "If sometimes you can't 

hear me, it's because I'm in parenthesis." "Why is the alphabet in that order? Is it 

because of that song?" "The other day I...no that wasn't me." "You can't have 

everything, where would you put it?"
