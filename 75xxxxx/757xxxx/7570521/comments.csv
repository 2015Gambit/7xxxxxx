[T],trialNerror,2012-08-26T09:27Z,"psspss, I've already commented a few times on some of your uploads but apparently you missed it, so I'll post it here since I'll know you be stopping by to get this new original release of mine... you don't have to put tNesrc or whatever in the file name. I'm flattered you'd do that, but it's unnecessary. Mentioning the source in the description is plenty.

Also, be thankful.  If all you have to say is ""ta"", save it...  If all you have is criticism about file name, size, or when it was/wasn't released; save it. We don't care. A lot of times you act very ungrateful and it gets very annoying. "

[V],psspss,2012-08-26T11:38Z,"i know i dont have too but if theres multiple sources i could use I add it.. as some people like to know which one I used

I wont unless the name gets to long

did you read my other comments on your torrents
about the sci chan show? and AGH?

seems chads got a few docus and will be airing his ghost one about his life on 30oct

they milking cash on it.. only been showing it on a tours .. they must be making a million a year easy I say

now they want to charge $14 for one viewing on a crappy webpage of the docu instead of releasing on a dvd

think they got corrupted but the dark side :)"
