The Football League Show 26.08.2012

With three games played in eight days the season is well and truly up and running and this week we have a chance to take a closer look at the three clubs relegated from the Premier League in May. Blackburn take on Leicester at Ewood Park, title favourites Bolton meet Nottingham Forest and Wolves entertain Derby. All the action brought to you by Manish Bhasin.
