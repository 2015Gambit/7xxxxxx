,Tyreneous,2012-09-09T21:58Z,"Now correct me if I'm wrong.. I have been a black beard for quite some time and am fairly knowledgeable on computers and software and comodo detects a viral infection in the gsrld.dll file in the .28, .29, .49, and .55 updates I've downloaded thus far.. however it did not detect a virus in the .22 update that I also have... how is it that the .22 does not show up as positive yet the others do? I have read reports of people's computers going into lock down and the files phoning home to all these random IP addresses... I see that you have the ""trusted"" symbol.. what does this exactly mean? Trusted by who's standards? does this mean that everything you post is tested and scanned by you? and that it does not contain anything bad like a virus? just find it funny how the other updates are infected and .22 isn't...."
