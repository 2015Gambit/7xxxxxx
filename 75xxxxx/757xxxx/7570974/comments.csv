,Rush,2012-08-26T21:45Z,"I'd settle on a decent cam of this in English, before I'm going to suffer through Russian w/ Spanish subs
 Any up-loaders out there got a lead on a cam of this?"
,trippinballs,2012-08-26T21:53Z,Spanish would be a relevant language if it was 1750. That's not the case. English is the world's language now.
,beemer2012,2012-08-27T02:31Z,"good video, wish i could speak spanish though."
,horsesavvyJo,2012-08-27T03:00Z,PLEASE one of the great uploaders-you know who you are. Upload this movie in English. I am not one of those talented people who speaks another language fluently enough to decypher this one. Thanks for the UP though.
,betchael,2012-08-27T19:26Z,any english language or even translation please :(
,pdrpdr,2012-08-29T07:25Z,"@trippinballs: Obviously this is an english spoken movie, so it must be see in english. But what you said about spanish isn't true, spanish is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, after mandarin (1st) and english (2nd). Spanish (in different versions )is spoken in all latin america, spain and even in US (if you only count native speakers, it's used by more people than english, obviously a lot of are secondary speakers of english). I travel a lot, and even as I know spanish, french and english i visited a lot of places where those 3 languages weren't enough, the world is bigger and more interesting than you think.. "

,Rush,2012-09-01T20:29Z,"@pdrpdr..... ummmm sort of, Mandarin by far the most ""native spoken language"" (first language) but English is spoken by 1.8 billion people (overall) vs. Mandarin 1.3 billion(overall)... this is one reason why English is still used as the only language required for international airline pilots.
You're correct that Spanish is spoken more (natively) than English 325 million vs approx 400 million, but Hindi (several versions) also beats both of them (natively) too at 460 million.

When are one of you up-loaders going to find us a decent English cam or a hijacked DVDrip of this movie?"

,Merkel_is_nazi,2012-09-04T22:44Z,"Bastante es tener que tragársela en rusky, espero que al menos los subtítulos estén en castellano y no en panchito."
,Merkel_is_nazi,2012-09-05T00:47Z,"Es castellano, pero la traducción es lamentable y tiene tantas faltas de ortografía como si lo hubiera escrito un panchito tercermundista."
,MariaVRealM,2012-09-05T10:08Z,Muchas gracias por esta peli tan inspiradora!!!
,cowfucker,2012-09-07T04:29Z,Someone go a film this or rip it at risk and personal cost to themselves so I can watch it for free.
,manya,2012-09-07T18:56Z,"@Merkel_is_nazi parece ke el nazi aca sos vos gallego careta, tercer mundo? y tu pais de mierda se esta llendo a pique, seguro ke se viene la segunda invacion a america, apronta el bote roña!"
,genx2012,2012-09-07T20:12Z,Not clear copy & Yes it's russian only
,browncow2,2012-09-07T20:19Z,"cowfucker is right! Someone needs to post a top quality English speaking version of this at great personal risk, so we can enjoy this movie for at no cost."
,ndb888,2012-09-09T03:13Z,surely someone could record audio in the cinema and then add it to this release. Less chance of being caught and with minimal quality loss
,magznolia,2012-09-11T21:36Z,This is better than nothing and thank you for it. There are no theaters where I live. Be aware that the Spanish subtitles are mostly wrong. Some of the dialogue can be read on the official site. V=8 A=shit but I GOT TO SEE IT!
,sj_bloushi,2012-09-16T12:00Z,It's been 4 f*cking months and all i have is a Russian/Spanish subtitled crapped? omg please! i am literally dying to see this movie! :(((
