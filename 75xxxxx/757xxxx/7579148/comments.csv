Why don't you get off the computer for a bit and get a life, you come across as a lonely desperate loser. People can upload WHATEVER they want WHENEVER they want, it doesn't matter if you have just loaded the same file previously.

Seriously, sort your shit out.

Peace"

,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-08-30T00:49Z,"I', not 'spamming' your torrents kid, I'm just making a comment on ONE. 

LOL, YOU are the one who SPAMS everyone elses torrents telling them not to post certain files, that your files are better, directing people to go to your files when they ask other uploaders about things.

Some people like to download off certain uploaders, and seeing you SPAMMING their torrents with advertising for your own is just annoying.

You've already been reported AND warned.

Grow up."

you must grow up.When the others uploaders don't do anything never about the users ask their help I helped them.Do something usefull I reported you before don't spam my torrents.Finally as you can see I always help the users that ask something about my torrents.The other android uploaders don't give a shit about them.Just check the reply to users questions in their torrents.A good uploader must support their uploads and answer the questions.Someone that ignore them it means he/she doesn't know anything about the torrents he/she uploads.

Ended here...."
