Up with Chris Hayes; Sunday, August 25, 2012.

Chris was joined by:  Katha Pollitt (columnist for The Nation). Esther Armah (author, playwright, and radio host of WBAI-FM's "Wake Up Call"). Michelle Goldberg (senior contributing writer for Newsweek/Daily Beast and author of "The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power and the Future of the World"). W. Kamau Bell (comedian and host of FX's "Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell.")


Kristen Day (executive director of Democrats for Life) joined via satelitte a little later.

They examined the moral and political aspects of the controversy surrounding Missouri Republican Senatorial Candidate Rep. Todd Akin's abortion comments, and  the history of a spurious myth that has somehow persisted in many far-right circles: that women cannot become pregnant if they are "legitimately" raped. 

Later on:

Ta-Nehisi Coates (senior editor at The Atlantic and author of "The Beautiful Struggle: A Father, Two Sons, and an Unlikely Road to Manhood") replaced Katha Pollitt. Melissa Harris-Perry (host of MSNBC's "Melissa Harris-Perry" and professor at Tulane University) took the spot of Michelle Goldberg. Jay Smooth (host of WBAI-FM's "Underground Railroad") replaced Esther Armah.

They discussed racial politics with a blockbuster panel that included Ta-Nehisi Coates (author of the riveting new essay "Fear of a Black President" in The Atlantic).

Michelle Goldberg came back for "Now we know" because MHP had a gig.
