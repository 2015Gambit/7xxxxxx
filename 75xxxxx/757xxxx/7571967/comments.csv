I've already downloaded this torrent and I can't get Sega Rally to work with Null DC or when I burn it.  The only playable copy I was able to find doesn't have music.
I recently did find a working copy of Armada, but it only works on the Dreamcast, not on an NullDC which is strange."

Thanks for the upload !!!!"
