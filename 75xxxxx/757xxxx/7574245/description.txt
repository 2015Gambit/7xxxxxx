Bionic Woman is an American science fiction television drama that aired in 2007, which was created by David Eick, under NBC Universal Television Group, GEP Productions, and David Eick Productions.

The series was a re-imagining of the original television series, The Bionic Woman, created by Kenneth Johnson.

The storyline is based upon the novel Cyborg by Martin Caidin, and retains its forebear's premise while taking on a more contemporary setting. David Eick also serves as executive producer alongside Laeta Kalogridis and Jason Smilovic. Production of the series was halted due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America, and following its failure to be included in the Fall 2008 schedule it was announced that the series was canceled as the result of low ratings.

The series revolved around bartender Jaime Sommers, who is saved from death after receiving experimental medical implants. While adjusting to her new bionic powers and raising a rebellious younger sister, Jaime agrees to work for the Berkut Group, a quasi-governmental private organization that performed her surgery.
