[V],twentyforty,2012-08-28T19:43Z,"@ani12: It was uploaded when S1 has finished, and it is well seeded. In two torrents, as normal collection of my weekly episodes - Homeland.Season.1.480p.HDTV.H264 (2.14 GB) and encodes of On Demand (better quality) in 4.32 GB Homeland.Season.1.OnDTV.480p.H264. Not here, for now. Go you know where and take your pick."

[V],twentyforty,2012-08-29T06:31Z,@019815: As 720p only. Hulu premium is not cheap. Encoding again two seasons is maybe a week. I really thought how you figured that out after absence of my answer week ago.
