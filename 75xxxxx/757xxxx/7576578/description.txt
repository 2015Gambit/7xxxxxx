is nothing has changed in way i convert the stuff it should play
on all devices


To avoid problems with some Ahole sharing bad bits with you which
may be the problem or maybe its a BUG in the client your using
so I recommend

you do the following as what I use

1) download peerblock 1.1
2) use client Utorrent 2.2.1
3) and scan disk you download partition and C drive (where log files and hashes
are kept)
4) at end right-click on torrent in UT list and do a force recheck to be sure you have all the parts
properly 
5) invest in a VPN as well. but not needed unless you want privacy and ideal
