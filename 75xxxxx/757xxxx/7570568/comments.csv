,clear009,2012-08-26T10:13Z," I plan on uploading blitzkrieg antholgy as well later. If you like this, I have 2 dvd's (8 gigs) more of files for all the games that use the blitzkrieg engine..   Also for those who don't know you can click my name at the top of this page ""clear009"" for my uploads........"
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:21Z,Also I may need to turn my computer off for awhile for a lil maintenance. But keep your torrent program on cause I will continue seeding until there are at least 7-8 other people seeding it.
,clear009,2012-09-06T00:29Z,Going to seed all my torrents for awhile since some people are getting it and not seeding and helping others who want it.. Plus I will post some more files for the blitzkrieg series.. If anyone is interested in any other WW2 games let me know I may have it.
