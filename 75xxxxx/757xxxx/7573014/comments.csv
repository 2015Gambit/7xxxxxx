,trntz-man,2012-08-27T05:47Z,"Thanks! 

To other users: Why AVI? MP4 and MKV are lossless quality, once converted to AVI it looses video quality."
,brad101,2012-08-27T05:51Z,"Thank you for another fine release ettv.

To those waiting for AVI, stop. Upgrade your client and get on with the program - XVID is dead. x264 is the future (mp4)."
