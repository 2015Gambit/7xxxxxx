The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday, August 26 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the FCC's internet tax and takeover plan, the arrest of activist Antonio Buehler, and the unprecedented and outrageous ammunition purchases by various government agencies as the economy slumps further and analysts warn about social chaos in the streets. 

He also runs down the state of gun rights and the Second Amendment as following the shooting outside the Empire State Building in New York and takes a look at the shooting of U.S. embassy personnel in Mexico by trigger-happy federales.
