Sir Mark Elder conductor

Sir Mark Elder honours Ivor Novello - the tunesmith and matinee idol who dominated London's stage musicals in the 1930s and 1940s.

Remember such time-honoured favourites as `We'll gather lilacs'? Tonight we acknowledge that patriotic First World War plea to `keep the home fires burning' in a tribute to a silent-movie actor, West End playwright, composer and star of a string of stage musicals hugely popular in their day.

Ivor Novello, the most consistently successful composer of British musicals before the advent of Andrew Lloyd Webber, nowadays tends to be unjustly neglected. Sir Mark Elder is a committed advocate, as is tonight's master of ceremonies, Simon Callow.
