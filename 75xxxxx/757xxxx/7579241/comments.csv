See the ""MP4"" in the name, well it should be ""MP3"" and is in fact the name of the file if you look.

Not going to be monitoring this torrent, but if you download the correct one (with ""MP3"" in the name), it'll point to the same source file.

Sorry all around ... wish this place let us delete mistakes before anybody noticed.

So much for ""anonymous"", huh?"
,pc-Gnome,2012-08-29T00:40Z,"No, that's not quite right either.

You're file will say ""MP4"" just like the torrent.

Rats!"
