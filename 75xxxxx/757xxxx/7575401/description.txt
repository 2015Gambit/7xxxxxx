As professional disk encryption software safeguarding data on any type of drive, Cryptic Disk will be a reliable defense for your files regardless of where they are located. The program can create virtual encrypted disks as well as encrypt physical hard disks (in their entirety or just certain partitions), USB drives and memory cards.

Data are encrypted using the most reliable modern algorithms (AES/Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, Blowfish, CAST6) with support for XTS mode, which was specially developed for encrypting data on disk drives. Transparent encryption allows working with an encrypted disk just like with any other one, without the computer's performance being impacted in the slightest.

Cascade encryption (the use of multiple algorithms in sequence) allows disk encryption software to improve cryptographic strength, in the case of Cryptic Disk by increasing the encryption key size from 256 to 2944 bits. For additional security, Cryptic Disk has built-in protection from brute force password attacks and keyloggers.

Thus Cryptic Disk is the most reliable disk encryption software today for protecting personal information and secret corporate data from hacking attempts. Not only does the program meet all generally accepted security standards, but it boasts a number of innovative technologies and solutions unique in its class.

Highlights 
ΓÇó Creation of virtual encrypted disks from container files and mounting them as separate disks 
ΓÇó Encryption of whole disk partitions (internal and removable) as well as other drives (memory cards, pen drives, USB drives, and more) without losing information 
ΓÇó Transparent (on-the-fly) data encryption which takes place in real time and does not affect computer performance 
ΓÇó Deniable Encryption so that encrypted volumes do not contain any signatures which could be used to prove that they are encrypted disks or containers 
ΓÇó Plausible Deniability, which allows creating hidden encrypted disks multiply nested inside of each other (steganography) 
ΓÇó Support for using key files together with a password or instead of a password, offering users flexibility in how they deploy the disk encryption software
