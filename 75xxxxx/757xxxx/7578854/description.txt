Description: Madchild of Swollen Members, was on a kamikaze run with the drug oxycontin that had pushed him to the brink of oblivion. Madchild had finally hit rock bottom. His drug addiction had spiraled out of control and destroyed everything the successful emcee had worked so hard to build with is platinum selling hip-hop group Swollen Members. The fancy cars, lavish houses and rock star luxuries were all gone, as his addiction had consumed over 3 million dollars worth of assets and finances in just over four years. [...] Not only is ΓÇÿDope SickΓÇÖ a story of triumph over adversity, but it has allowed Madchild to be reborn creatively. Unshackled from the chains of his past indiscretions, Madchild has confronted his darkest emotions and used them as a source of inspiration to create one of the most insanely captivating hip-hop releases of 2012.
