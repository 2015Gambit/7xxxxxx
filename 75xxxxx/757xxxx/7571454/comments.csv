What Must I Do To Update An Application In Android??"

If you have root you can backup your old app.Then unistall it and install the new and then restore only the data.With this way you will have the new version with your old data from the other version."

Sorry To Trouble You.

What Exactly Is Root??
And Cant I Just Update My Prev Version Directly?? If Yes Then How?"

The root gives you full super user permissions to your device.You can use titanium backup for backup your games/programs or lucky patcher for patch some apps/games that work only with root.My opinion is all android phones must have root.Try to install the new apk that you downloaded over your older.It must work fine with your old data work and the new features."
