This is the first ever movie Heath Ledger starred in.
An extremely rare tape.
He played the orphan clown in the cut scenes at the train station.
Shot on location in Perth, Western Australia and Paris, France.

In and out of foster homes for most of his life, 14-year old Sim wants nothing more than to be a professional circus clown. His new foster parents, however, have other plans for him. But Sim won't let go of his dream and sets off on a series of exciting adventures taking him from Australia to Paris. With the support of friends collected on the way, Sim learns the art of clowning is more than just clowning around.
