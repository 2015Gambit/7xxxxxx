Release Notes....: As I'm sure others are, I'm fed up with IMMERSE/ASAP ivtc. It's
complete crap, leaving annoying dupe and missing frames throughout
every single release. Here is a short list of the ones I caught in
the first seven minutes. There are many more later in the show but
I thought this would suffice

Missing Frames: 2m03s 2m16s 2m55s 4m29s 4m33s 4m41s 4m42s 4m49s
5m30s 6m06s 6m58s 7m06s

Dupe Frames: 2m15s 2m17s(x2) 2m52s 4m28s 4m33s 4m34s 4m35s 4m41s
4m42s 4m43s 4m52s 5m03s 5m29s 7m03s 7m05s 7m06s

I probably missed some too. The missing frames are difficult to
spot in low-motion segments

IMMERSE/ASAP please let this be a wake-up call that your filters
are not good enough. Fix your tool
