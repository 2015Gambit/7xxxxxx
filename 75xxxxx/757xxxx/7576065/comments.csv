This release is strictly for reviewing purposes only. aPC does not condone the use of peer 2 peer networks for file-trading. If these files continue to reach peer 2 peer networks, aPC will take action and if need be will stop distributing releases.

Peer to peer file-trading is irreparably damaging to the record industry.
= Is it? Any proofs? Again, couldn't care less, 
Releases which become widely distributed can be replicated on a massive scale and may fund terrorism. This must be prevented.

=Don't tell me what to do, and I won't tell you where to go. Alright?"
