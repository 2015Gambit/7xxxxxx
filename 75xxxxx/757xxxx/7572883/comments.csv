,tymature,2012-09-15T14:06Z,"I tried to install Windows 7 64bit on a third computer.  It accepted the Product Key and installed okay.  When I checked in Control Panel, System & Security, System and clicked the Verification Check Now box it went online to check with Microsoft.  I got the message Unacceptable OEM.  This was the same OEM displayed on the other two computers that Verified okay.
I downloaded the Remove WAT file with the registered computer, put it on a USB stick and copied it to the desktop of the computer that would not Verify.  I doubled clicked it and it said it would Restart Now.  After restarting, the computer desktop opened up and I checked in Control Panel, System & Security, System again.  The two lines asking me whether I wanted to Verify Now were gone.

I presume Windows 7 64bit is now Verified.  Anyway, it seems to be working perfectly."
