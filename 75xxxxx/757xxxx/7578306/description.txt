The Dixie Hummingbirds~A Christian Testimonial: Their First Album Plus Bonus 45s (Shout) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Its severe title notwithstanding, Christian Testimonial captures the Dixie Hummingbirds at their most daring, drawing on secular R&B hallmarks to push their breathtaking harmonies in appealing new directions. Backed by little more than simple guitar accompaniment, the Hummingbirds evoke the clarity and purity of a cappella, but their harmonies also boast an elasticity unmistakably rooted in street-corner doo wop; alter the subject matter from Jesus to the pretty girl next door, and Christian Testimonial would fit comfortably alongside the best of the Drifters or the Clovers.~Jason Ankeny (Allmusic)
