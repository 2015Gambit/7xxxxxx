Deluge 1.3.5

Open Source BitTorrent Client 
http://http://deluge-torrent.org/

"Deluge is a full-featured  BitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows"

you can download it from it's website, i'm just trying to promote it, given the adherence to uTorrent client by some many users

in their words: "Our GPL nature allows you to be 100% sure that our program will never ΓÇ£spyΓÇ¥ on your activities. Closed-source BitTorrent clients cannot make that same claim. "
