Credit scoring aims to quantify the likelihood of a prospective borrower defaulting on payment over a specified period of time. The credit score is calculated using increasingly sophisticated statistical models, which vary considerably between individual cases. This clearly-written and comprehensive text covers the scorecard development process and provides a practical how-to guide for those wanting to use and develop credit scoring techniques.

Assuming little prior knowledge, the text includes the relevant statistical and mathematical tools, numerous real-life examples, and discussion of the credit risk management cycle and the importance of credit scoring in business and regulatory environments, including Basel II.

An extensive glossary and bibliography make this an indispensable desktop reference for graduate students in statistics, business, economics and finance, MBA students, credit risk and financial practitioners.
