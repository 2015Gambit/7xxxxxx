CrystalDiskInfo monitors HDD/SSD health status and temperature, and does all the usual monitoring/graphing of S.M.A.R.T. information. It also tells you how many times the hard disk has been turned on and how many hours it's been on for.


rystalDiskInfo monitors the status of hard drives that support SMART technology Monitors and provides an overall assessment of "health" of your drive. Also displays detailed information about the hard drives installed in your computer (flash, serial number, a standard interface, the total time, etc.), and also displays the attributes of the parameters of SMART self-test (read errors, performance, start/stop spindle, seek time, the number of on-off cycles, errors and many other sectors).
