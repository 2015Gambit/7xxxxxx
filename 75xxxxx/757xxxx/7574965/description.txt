Pictured Within was the first studio album from Deep Purple's Jon Lord in sixteen years. It is considered Lord's most adventurous concept album, largely instrumental and contemplative. It features performances from Sam Brown, Miller Anderson, Pete York and Thijs van Leer among others. Pictured Within was released in October 1998 by Virgin Classics. "Wait A While", one of the few non-instrumental tracks off the album, performed by Sam Brown, was issued as a single in 1999. In addition, Jon Lord played a short tour of Germany in May 1999 to promote the album.
