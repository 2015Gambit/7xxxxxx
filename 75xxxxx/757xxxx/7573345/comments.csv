,Fallerup,2012-08-27T07:14Z,what? 1.87 GB? there has to be some mistake or the quality of this is super good... thats almost 5 times the normal size
,umsebastian,2012-08-27T07:59Z,"fallerup, eztv has uploaded this size for 11 episodes and you question it at the season finale, go back to season one and start over you retard"
,LaninhoSC,2012-08-27T08:04Z,"Fallerup, this's 720p version, the size is cool, nothing wrong with that. And the uploader is eztv, just look the green skull"

,tollertoller,2012-08-28T02:45Z,"1.87 gig? that should be the season, not one show. What's the deal?"
,vxcp08,2012-08-28T09:33Z,EZTV u should do the hole 6 season in a pack
,balanced,2012-08-29T16:03Z,1.87GB would be enough data for the entire season if you were watching it on an ipod nano maybe but if you want to watch it on any 720p screen or higher 1.87GB is pretty much correct.
