This copy of Quake III Arena is the latest you're going to find
It runs the IoQuake engine, bypassing the 1.32c update patch.

This will work on all normal Quake 3 Arena/Team Arena servers.
For versions older than 1.32 you will need a Q3 Version Changer.

Use "ioquake.x86.exe" to start the game, OR, create a shortcut
and place the shortcut where ever is easy for you to access later.
