[1] Crosseyed tease from Trey.

Performers: Trey Anastasio, Page McConnell, Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon

Notes: During Alumni, Fish stated he didn't have a degree and later said he did. After Alumni, Trey said that Fish did have a degree, adding that they met in 1983 at UVM and that Fish held a very interesting record: the lowest grade point average ever recorded at UVM. Fish added "for a non-fraternity student" and both Trey and Fish joked about Fish's GPA (giving low numbers). Trey added that they were both saved by Page at Goddard and that Page earned $100 for recruiting them to Goddard. Trey introduced Tube and My Sweet One as Fishman songs, asking the crowd to count the number of times "you" appeared in the song. There was a delay in starting My Sweet One until Page said they have a lot of interesting stories (about Fishman), prompting Fishman to immediately start the song. Mike's and Suzy contained a Crosseyed teases from Trey.
