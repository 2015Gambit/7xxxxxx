been an incredible ride that Ive been riding and now
viewers will be able to come along ont ride with me.

"Until the day NASA invents a Keith Lemon simulator then
this four-part 45-minute show is the only way people will
be able to experience being me, without actually being me.
I hope me bird dont mind cameras int bedroom."
