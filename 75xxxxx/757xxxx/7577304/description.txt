Episode 13: Pirate Booty Call
 The 'Wives arrive in St. Barths and party with a local named Tomas.
The ladies arrive in St. Barths, without Aviva who stayed back due to her phobias, and head straight for their beautiful villa and realize it's first class all the way around. On their first evening Russ, Carole's boyfriend who is on the island for a blues festival, shows up just in time to meet the women and save the conversation and the rest of the evening. A night out at Le Ti has the ladies enjoying tequila shots and a pirate-themed performance, led by the ladies' liaison, Tomas, a hot Johnny Depp look-alike. The next morning, rumor has it LuAnn kept the party going much later than anyone else.
