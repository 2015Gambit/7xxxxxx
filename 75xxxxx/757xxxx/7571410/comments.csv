You have installed Live Gaming for Windows ?? and open game from desktop shortcut (windows XP )"
,Anroid869,2012-08-29T07:38Z,"Which version of GamesforWindowsLive does it need then?
I had version 3.5.50.0 installed a while back.

You mention in the text the version is so critical (which for most games it isnt?!)

Excuase me for my remark (junk/fake) but Piratebay seems to sworm with fakes and imposters nowadays."
,radurall,2012-08-29T08:28Z,"@ Anroid869 

uninstall that version and install version included in torrent or keep your version but you need an offline account activated to play game"
,Anroid869,2012-09-02T13:24Z,"Ok, manage to install it and started to play, but it seems like it only a trail version of the game, because I'm asked to re-insert the disc after the initial level ???
Have I missunderstand something here or is this just because I' using WinXP?? "
