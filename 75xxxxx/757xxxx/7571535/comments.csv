NYTDDS is a pizza faced nerd with nothing better to do than to bitch and whine about how every single video file ever uploaded to TPB is broken.

He is a moron and a feeble idiot who sends the average IQ skyrocketing when he walks into the room due to it being the same number as a carrots and by comparison everyone else looks like a genius.

He doesn't know how to operate VLC media player and will bitch about anything he can.

Don't even get him started on his Nintendo DS (with the right mods) LOL

He is a new user though so I went easy on him, our first days were always hard too.

Someday he will figure out how to 'do computers' like a normal child."
