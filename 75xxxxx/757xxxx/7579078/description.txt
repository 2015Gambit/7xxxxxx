The Scott Horton Show

Scott is back home after his appearance at PAUL Fest. He plays the audio of the speech he delivered there, as well as the one by Anthony Gregory [Independent Institute, Future of Freedom Foundation, LewRockwell.com].

Scott's guest today is Mark Sheffield of PolicyOnPoint.com, whose most recent article there is "How to Blow Up the World: EverymanΓÇÖs Guide to European Missile Defense."

I usually divide Scott's shows on the points at which he takes a break and plays some music. Today, that would have resulted in a 54 minute segment followed by a 4:30 segment, followed by a couple of medium-length parts. Rather than that, I decided to just go with two 50 minute+ files.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
