This is a brand new show to be aired - it was originally scheduled to be shown late 2011, but was deferred by Channel 10 in Oz to now.

It's not a game show, it is not a UK production, the BBC is not the network that ran or commissioned it, and it did not premiere in 2002. "

IMDB lists the 2002 show as the only entry."
