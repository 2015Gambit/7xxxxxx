So these are just the stripped preset files. Because the other torrents didn't have this for me, i extracted this from the DL of the trial from izotope's site. So that's all it is.

To get this to work automatically with OZONE:
go to Documents/Izotope

put the torrent's files in there. If you don't find it immediately upon opening ozone, there's a button to search for the files.

voila!
