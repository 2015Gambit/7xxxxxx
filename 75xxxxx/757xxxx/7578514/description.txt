ΓÇÿDamulΓÇÖ (Bonded until Death), produced and directed by Prakash Jha under his own banner of Prakash Jha Productions, is a stunning comment on the happenings in contemporary rural India. The story of the film, which is set in Bihar, dwells on the all-round exploitation of the backward communities and the atrocities perpetrated on them by a handful of powerful men who operate the ΓÇÿPanhaΓÇÖ system, ΓÇÿPanhaΓÇÖ meaning shelter and protection. The landlords trap potential bounded labourers into committing petty crimes (mostly planted) and then grant them shelter and protection when the police arrive. The labourers are left with no choice but to do the landlordsΓÇÖ bidding ΓÇô they steal for them and pay back the loans, the stealing being mostly confined to cattle.
