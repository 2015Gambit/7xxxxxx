The yard looks just like my brother-in-law's back yard, and he lives in a middle-class neighborhood.  Their fence is old, beat up wood, and the BBQ and chairs look like something from a flea market.  The early UK BB Seasons were also low budget - and the surprising thing about UK is they allow any and all cuss words.  Anyway - as to BB AU, I remember that on or about the 3rd or 4th Season . . . suddenly they had a ritzy, shiny new House, large plush yard, and even a small stadium for the competitions.  BB Australia just got better and better with each Season.  Season 8 was my Favorite"

,PCdoc7,2012-08-28T15:36Z,"I AM SOOOOO SORRRY.
I reviewed some clips today and have found that they are MIS-NUMBERED !!!  

I am renaming them all - and when done will post up a link to a batch file to allow you to rename all the files in just a few seconds.  Will post up the link later today ! !   Again - sorry."
,PCdoc7,2012-08-29T01:39Z,"OK Guys - the file numbers were messed up but ALL files are there.  This batch file will instantly rename them all PROPERLY !!  
NOTE:  goto the link, and unzip the file.  Make sure that the Batch file ""renameBB.bat"" is in the SAME folder where the BB files are and then run it.  

DONE !!

,lifeson98,2012-08-29T04:19Z,Worked like a charm !!!!!!  Scared me for a minute when I saw the order was screwed.  But the batch renamed all the files in about 1 sec.  I checked a few of the shows and the order was correct.  Awesome - thanks for the quick fix.
