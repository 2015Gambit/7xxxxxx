Failed States
Propagandhi

Celebrating three decades of life in the political and musical hinterlands, Propagandhi will release their sixth studio album, Failed States, on September 4th. The albumΓÇÖs first single ΓÇ£Failed StatesΓÇ¥ debuts today and can be heard now by going HERE. Fans can pre-order Failed States now at The Epitaph Store. Additionally, Propagandhi will kick off a North American tour in September with support from Comback Kid. Dates are listed below.

Failed States willfully careens between brazen metallic tendencies and the ragged punk rock roots of Propagandhi's earlier work, further raising the lyrical and musical bar set by their critically-acclaimed 2009 release, Supporting Cast(e).

ΓÇ£Our goal is always to create a no-holds-barred, forward-thinking, tip-of-the-hat to the giants -- Voivod, Rush, NoMeansNo, SNFU, Sacrifice, Razor, Guilt Parade ΓÇô that have gone before us,ΓÇ¥ says vocalist and guitarist, Jesus H. Chris. ΓÇ£We are in their debt and take the mission seriously. Even when we're singing about liking Kurt Russell as Captain Ron, we take the mission seriously. Failed States is our most formidable ΓÇô and to me personally, our most surprising -- attempt at conjuring the numinous from the quotidian. Yes, I had to look those words up.ΓÇ¥

The result is one of the bandΓÇÖs most forward thinking and musically varied albums to date. Failed States is not simply proof of Propagandhi's continued dedication to pushing their musical boundaries, but an evocative (and provocative) meditation on human nature, meaning and life under an expanding, planet-wide technocracy. Ranging from dynamic, progressive rock of ΓÇ£Note To SelfΓÇ¥ to the accelerated heaviness of ΓÇ£Duplicate Keys Icaro (An Interim Report)ΓÇ¥ and blazing thrash cuts like ΓÇ£Hadron CollisionΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Things I Like,ΓÇ¥ Propagandhi has created a truly monumental sixth album.
