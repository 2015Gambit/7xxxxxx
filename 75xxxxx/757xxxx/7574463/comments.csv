,macpape,2012-08-28T19:02Z,only black screen with some music...
,xanonymous,2012-08-29T09:16Z,"Only the very first launch takes a long time and video may not come up right away. When you hear music for a while but have no video just quit the app (cmd & Q) wait a few seconds and then relaunch. After that it starts quicker and works fine. And yes, multiplayer via LAN and internet works!"
,friaug,2012-08-30T23:23Z,it opens up the app icon with the blue light spot underneath it but it won't open. please help?

,LNG33,2012-08-31T22:51Z,"wont work for me either, app bounces then docks as app not responding. 
Unzipped and installed xquartz, updated it then copied app into app folder as instructed in the zip. Do we need to do anything in xquartz to get the app to play? Have rebooted, reinstalled etc but still non responsive. Help?
On a mid 2011 Mac Mini (2.3GHz Intel Core i5) if that makes a difference. (mountain lion 10.8.1)"
