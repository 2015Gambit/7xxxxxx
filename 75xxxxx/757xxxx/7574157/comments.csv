,xXxmtdoomxXx,2012-08-29T00:37Z,"finally, a legit torrent of this surfaces. i couldn't wait, since i'm a such a big fan of pentagram, so i bought it on itunes a few weeks ago (which was probably the right thing to do anyway, i have no problem spending money on anything pentagram) this documentary is pretty awesome, it's almost unreal that he actually got back on stage and out of the funk he was in. at the beginning he looked almost like he could die at any time. i have a lot of respect for this man, so parts of it was really sad, especially when they were focusing in on his heavy drug use. i just hope he can stay on the path he was headed down by the end of the movie. i give it a 9 out of 10, i'd say it's interesting even if you know nothing about pentagram or bobby liebling, though i can't say so for sure."

It's a heavy story and at the same time a beautiful lesson of life. Bobby Liebling is one of the most talented musicians that has walked on earth. THANKS! PENTAGRAM FOR LIFE! DOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ALSO SUPPORT THE FILMMAKERS THAT SPEND 4 YEARS MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE OF UNDERGROUND MUSIC CULTURE THAT HAS INFLUENCED EVERYTHING HEAVY WE LISTEN TODAY."
