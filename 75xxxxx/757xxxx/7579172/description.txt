This is a hardcoded version of Yify's 1080p release of The Last Samurai. I take NO credit for sourcing or
encoding the original film. I recompressed the 1080p version to 1280x720 and hardcoded the English
subs for the Spanish speaking parts.

I am well aware that my encoding skills are NO WHERE near as amazing as the Yify teams. The quality
is still there. The audio is Stereo 96KB. I also realize my 720p is the size of their 1080p.

I hardcoded these subs for myself out of need. I decided to upload this because I figure I cannot be
the only person out there that streams videos to their TV and hates it that the SRT sub files do not get 
picked up.

I appreciate anyone that downloads and seeds. Please remember, sharing is caring. Thank you.
