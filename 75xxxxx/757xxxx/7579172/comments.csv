,Sanchez101,2012-08-29T07:16Z,"Could you upload Point Break, Carlito's Way, The Sopranos and Entourage T.V Series please. 

You're doing a fantastic job, love your work!!"
,AMidgetAndAClub,2012-08-29T16:05Z,"Sanchez101 - I'm sorry. I generally only do things that I need or want. If there is enough demand, then I upload it."
,CullenEd,2012-08-29T17:33Z,Don't use YIFY name...
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-29T22:12Z,"^ Why? The uploader clearly stated they're not part of YIFY team. They added subtitles to a YIFY rip, which I'm sure some people appreciate so they don't have to hardcode the subs and remux themselves."
,AMidgetAndAClub,2012-08-30T00:36Z,"To clear up confusion, YIFY hardcodes are only being uploaded with explicit permission by Yify himself and his team. And I agreed to display their name, the original encoder, and so forth prominently in the title, file name, description, and read me file."
,CullenEd,2012-08-30T01:08Z,Okay. Chillax and sorry mate.
