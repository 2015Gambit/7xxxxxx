Cherie's therapy is evolving...She has something she needs to get off her chest, and until she does, she realizes that she cannot progress and be whole. She's thought on it long and hard and has decided that the time is right to open up to her doctor. She's buried the incident deep down for a long time and with good reason...But now, the time is right and Cherie opens her soul as she recounts every sordid detail. As her story unfolds, we learn that we are only beginning to see the darkness that has absorbed her world
