and when you can download from a faster mirror why download it as a slow torent?

-Just a simple search on google for ophcrack will take you to their homepage"

My hope was that this would become a well-seeded torrent with better download speed than the http mirror, which maxes out at about 100kB/s during peak times, often going much slower than that.

The XP version is also available here. I have the same goal for it."
