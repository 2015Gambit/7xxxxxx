This torrent is for those who want their kids to experience an awesome show!
Or just for those who want to take a trip down memory lane (like me).

I couldn't find any good torrents for this show, so I found it on my own, labeled and re-encoded and am bringing for your enjoyment.
THis is just Season 1, as I get the other Seasons I will upload them, and eventually mush them all together.


Quality is very decent.

Info:

The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon is a children's television series which aired in Canada on YTV and the United States on public television stations. It was a live-action show incorporating actors, full body costume characters (notably the titular dragon) and puppets. The story follows Dudley, a dragon who's recently woken up from centuries of hibernation and his new ten-year-old friends Matt and Sally. The two kids would guide Dudley around the modern world and the trio would learn about environmentalism, friendship and pro-social values.

Besides Matt and Sally, Dudley was later joined by other kids, Julia, Terry, Laura, and Mickey. Other recurring characters included a grouchy apple tree named Mr. Crabby Tree, a laid back frog named Sammy, a lovable caveman, and the Robins.
