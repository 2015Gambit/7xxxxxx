I have a question, and i know this is off topic, but this is the only place that i can think off, as where i may get an answer, as its mostly aussie's here.

Anyone know of where i can get AFL (australian football league) Torrents,
there is a huge market for them, but know one that i know of uploads them? 
Help would be appreciated.
