,droid05,2012-08-27T01:39Z,"i just downloaded this and its not a bad video but the audio is terrible

a:-3
the audio only worked for the first 10seconds and the last 10 seconds. i tried with vlc media player, windows media player, windows media center, and winamp and all did the same thing."
,skullhill,2012-08-27T02:03Z,"first 9 minutes in Spanish

V 6

A 6"
,skullhill,2012-08-27T02:10Z,"VLC played it in spanish for 9 minutes

quicktime didn't

V 4

A 4 "
,Binks92,2012-08-27T05:01Z,"So far I watched the first 4 minutes. Audio is worthy of a 7. As for audio, there are too many sources changes so far to be able to tell and I just reached the spanish entry point. I will try the quicktime player (VLC and WMP, both play the spanish).

I'll recomment afterwards."
,Binks92,2012-08-27T05:17Z,"Ok, so 1-> I fukcing hate quicktime. 2-> quicktime works like shit. 3-> quicktime doesn't even play the audio OR the video.

So that's for the quicktime tryout, fuyck apple.

As for the spanish, it starts at 3:19 and stops at 9:11, so that's 5 minutes and 52 seconds of spanish. Not 9.

once it comes back to english, the audio is pretty neat and like I said in my previous post, video is great for a cam.

Overall:

A: 6 (would be 7 if not for the 5:52 minutes of spanish)
V: 7

Thx scene4all, it's a shame there's only 2 torrewnts of this movie."
,Binks92,2012-08-27T05:19Z,"What happened to my comment?

A: 6 (7 if not for the 5:52 minutes of spanish)
V: 7

Thx, Scene4all"
,Phntzm79,2012-08-27T08:28Z,"English audio starts at 1:38 when the grandmother says ""what's happening now""? I use Quicktime but you must install the correct XviD codecs into the quicktime library on an intel mac. For PC users use VLC or GOM player which already have most of the popular codecs already installed! Peace, Phantazm"
,Phntzm79,2012-08-27T08:37Z,Correction English audio changes to Spanish and back to English at  9:14! Phantazm

,ipyngo,2012-08-28T05:56Z,"first off, endless thanks for the upload, as always. Uploaders (and seeders too!) are truly the modern day robin hoods and my own personal heroes. 

Anyway, when I downloaded the torrent I was having the same audio issue as a few others mentioned having in the comments where despite trying a ton of different media players (windows, quicktime, VLC, divx, ect) and speaker/headphones combinations, I could not get the majority of the audio play at a volume I could actually make out. However, I did manage to find a solution that worked for me so I wanted to share it with everyone.

So: If you are are encountering trouble with the audio being too low in volume, one way to fix it is enable graphic equalizing and spatializing on the audio. I used VLC (which, if you don't have, is awesome and free, btw ^_-) but I imagine other media players should have similar capabilities. To enable those settings on VLC, go to Tools->Effects & Filters->Audio, click the graphic equalizer tab and check the box marked ""enable"". Next, go to the Spatializer tab and check the box reading ""Enable Spatializer."" You should be good to go!

Hope that helps! I know at first I was a little confused."
,scorpiongirl86,2012-08-28T07:46Z,"good job!

1 problem was that there was background radio or idk what was playing which made it hard to understand audio. 

rest is great! thx."
,prez408,2012-08-28T19:45Z,my splash player works fine 
,bismarket,2012-09-02T14:20Z,"FOR - twrntg2 I expect it's something about Bullfighting or throwing donkeys off'f tall buildings, that's what ALL Spanish is about, isn't it?:Ă  Many thanx UL, after brightening it up a bit with VLC it was fine!"
,swo0sh,2012-09-04T23:54Z,"Hi, I didn't find video quality good hence I deleted the whole file from my HDD.

I would rate V - 4, A - 8.
Not worth to download - Its my personal opinion."
,morepunkthanu,2012-09-06T18:08Z,"Video-6
audio-3, really bad
thnx for the upload, but besides the Spanish beginning the sound's horrible. its got some noise like a tv or radio talking in it. how does that even happen? whoever made this first didnt know what they were doing"
,Gacy8Gein,2012-09-07T08:53Z,"V: 6
A: 5 to 4
M: 8

The Audio is very strange. In the silent parts, you can hear a radio playing music and stuff. It seems like a very cleaned up cam audio, or audio thats been captured over an FM Signal.

Its Watchable though.
The Spanish bit is awkward, and would have needed subtitles really."
,celmario,2012-09-07T23:18Z,To:bharatirajesh36? why don't you say this wonderful site you went on to watch this movie is a PAY_Site? which is one of the worst!! Scamming ripp-off sites you could give your cvc number to..?Are you A Pakistani with that name you apply yourself to here??
,michaelmotes,2012-09-09T01:43Z,"Denoised the audio, made it bearable. But like someone else said, how did the FM radio interference even get into this?
