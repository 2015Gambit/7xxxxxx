,Soulketcher,2012-08-28T01:47Z,"Dude - Seriously .. There is NOTHING about this torrent that is any different that the plethora of others posted here, there and everywhere in the last few days, with the one exception being that most of those were posted by trusted(skulled) users and not by a nobody who dares to state ""New Update 100% Work All bugs"" possibly causing all kinds of wasted bandwidth for the desperate noobs who are frothing at their collective mouths to have someone hold their hands while they click their heels together and say "" there's no crack like this crack, there 's no crack like this crack."" For those wondering, the poster DID opt to use multiple files allowing for the crack file to be viewed and compared to existing releases which has lead me to the conclusions I mention in this post. For those of you still clinging to hope that I am wrong, see for yourself or read it here - The torrent consists of the preload/full version & the crack included, while genuine, (based off of some quick file stat comparisons) is also the ""crack fix"" version that would have been downloaded by anyone having issues that sprung up from the initial crack offered by ""skidrow."" .. the bigger, seemingly unsolvable issue is the startup error using Windows 8.   

OH, and for the record: The ""Buddha.dll"" file present in the latest round of cracked games is NOT a FRIGGIN Virus, the real virus of plague like proportions is the one spread by the IDIOTS that insist it is and try to warn others allowing this ""Stupidity"" to spread more like a cancer than a virus.

  end rant.."

""The ""Buddha.dll"" file present in the latest round of cracked games is NOT a FRIGGIN Virus""

You may be right? I shut off my ESET AV and the game was fine. I turned it back on and it was still fine. I don't have my AV set for scheduled scans. Two days later I got a warning from ESET that it stopped a trojan (the copy on my desktop) and quarantined it. Since there was no scan going on, I'm led to believe that the buddha file actually is a self starting program. Am I missing something here?"
,HiDef1080p,2012-08-31T18:23Z,"Almost every time a developer will develop a library, a separate application will be created to use it. But at times, the logic in the GUI is so simple, there is no need for it. By using the RunDll.exe utility provided with Windows (generally under System32 folder), a developer can automatically provide the required GUI inside of the DLL itself. This eliminates the need to write a separate application to use it. Such DLLs don't need to be programmed only with Win32 API, you can also use MFC/ATL/WTL library if you wish to do so."
