,Machine4578,2012-08-27T01:58Z,THIS RELEASE IS ANOTHER PIECE OF SHIT FROM SHITROW!!!! IF YOU UPDATE YOUR GAME WITH THIS IT WILL CRASH!!!! DO NOT USE THIS AS IT WILL SOON BE NUKED!!!!!
,omnimodis,2012-08-27T07:02Z,"Doesn't work!  Fatal error (appcrash) at startup.  Game worked perfectly before updating with this.  Also, what is this new Buddha.dll crap?  The original crack doesn't have it, this update does have it, and I've noticed that most new releases now with that Buddha.dll shit are all problematic."
,SuslikM,2012-08-27T17:54Z,"It's because new CEG protection perfectly good at all.

Any memory patches has very short life-time itself(until Steam decides to update some files...).
VMProtect makes harder to reverse engenering dll's and exe. But also makes debuging impossible, so there is no support for cracks like duddha.dll or mahatma.one   :)"
,LeoSky,2012-08-27T20:34Z,Damn bruh...skidrow fuckin up wit all these bullshit releases
,giggedyguy,2012-08-28T09:12Z,"Hearing about this causing crashes on other sites, too. Too bad reloaded or some other group hasn't offered an update to this game. If they have, tell where, please. Skidrow has given me a lot of joy over the years but they've been messing things up a lot lately (instructions that don't even apply to some of their cracks for instance)."
,topk,2012-09-01T02:06Z,"I am on Core i7, 8 gigs RAM, HD 6990 video card and I am having MAJOR graphics issues with this game, it keeps lagging and freezing like if I was on Pentium 4 or something"
,-Natars-,2012-09-07T14:18Z,"Pour ceux qui ont un problème comme:
""le jeu n'a pas pu démarrer car le fichier nvtt.dll est introuvable [...]""

La solution est simple: il faut aller sur ce site:
fr.dll-file.com
vous tapez le nom du fichier recherché, vous le télécharger sous format .zip (deuxième onglet > deuxième moitié)
vous l'installez votre .dll comme indiqué dans le fichier texte dans votre .zip"
