,ambroz24,2012-08-28T15:13Z,is this the full package??
,Espana25,2012-08-28T17:39Z,to the date i still wonder why the people have been able to get their hands on this beautiful bird released by the captain sim a long time back even when it was just an exterior without any functional panel configs to it ...and even now today also we see there are many great flight simulation products been handled pretty nicely but just this one not even a single attempt to the crack i suppose ..lets have fingers crossed and see what goes in future.!
,boinga,2012-08-28T20:23Z,you make me feel very good and thats why i thank you but I have to say that my system is a bit low end and i think that I will get 3 FPS in the VC if I download this beautifull bird :( but still thank you very much good man
