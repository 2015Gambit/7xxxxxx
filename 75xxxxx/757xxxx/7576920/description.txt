Slave owners justified their actions by saying that black 
Africans were savages, vastly inferior to whites and 
little better than animals.

Here we have a slaver, of all people, who while engaged 
in his terrible but profitable business visits a community 
of black African people well before colonization by 
Europeans (beginning of the 19th century) and after 
describing how they lived, writes that they could teach 
contemporary Europeans a lot about honesty, morals, 
humane ways.

Seek in the text the chapter XIV about the Bagers and 
learn from the least sympathetic source the truth about 
that horribly wrong institution and the kind of people 
it enslaved and described as being little more than animals.



I can only seed for a short time, please continue seeding 
to keep it alive. Thanks.
