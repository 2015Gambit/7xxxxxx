SEED if you like this torrent."
,Fluffyandre,2012-08-27T15:08Z,Does any1 know how to make this work with http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7548157/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_DLC_RePack-VANSIK? because copy + paste doesn't work...
,tufel,2012-08-27T17:30Z,^^@Fluffyandre..I was about to ask the same question? Can someone help?
,asafmiara,2012-08-27T21:00Z,Fluffyandre and tufel just use this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7573616/Sleeping.Dogs-_All_DLCs_Cracked
,Stroncium,2012-08-27T22:06Z,"Works perfectly even with the Vansik version. I have a question though, I really hate the top dog packs and red envelope pack,which give me insane boosts, could you write me down which files are those so I can delete them and play without them? There are just code names like AC8D6F78 so I dont know which is which."
,scyris99,2012-08-27T22:39Z,WoW they really milking the hell out of it with dlc's aren't they.. 10 already?
,nignug,2012-08-28T00:03Z,"@scyris99 Don't act surprised. The future of gaming is day 1 DLCs followed by 50+ DLCs. All this time they are creating these shit DLCs they could be making a new game.

At least we have TPB!"
,Fluffyandre,2012-08-28T00:23Z,"Tufel, I think all that was needed is Steam installed.
After I installed it the game just worked ( you don't need to be logged in)."
,JayemWTF,2012-08-28T02:27Z,Will this work on a BlackBox repack?
,FeniXrisN,2012-08-28T03:06Z,"How can one go back to before installing the DLC's?  Why don't uploaders describe the DLC's too?  I don't want all these boosts to my game that I did not earn, that takes away the fun of playing it through."
,FeniXrisN,2012-08-28T03:14Z,"This DLC just ruined my whole game, unbelievable... hours of playing down the drain!"
,dvd918n1,2012-08-28T10:50Z,"^ indeed.. good thing it only messed up my autosave..

for reference.. Here you go..
1E6323E1 (Top Dog GOLD).dat
EE3FEA1 (GSP).dat
576E446C (Top Dog SILVER).dat
67EE992C (Martial Arts).dat
8C79ECFB (Retro Triad).dat
AC8D6F78 (High Roller).dat
BCF931BB (Police Protection).dat
C8F81F7D (Triad Enforcer).dat
D500D5B5 (Deep Undercover).dat
E58008F5 (Red Envelope).dat

the GOLD and SILVER dlcs spoils gameplay a lot, while the high roller and red envelop spoils early gameplay with easy money.. all others may or may not destroy gameplay as long as you do not wear the boosting outfits in missions IMO.."
,dvd918n1,2012-08-28T11:14Z,"since my comment deleted itself.. here you go again.. pardon the double post if the initial comment shows up.. 

for reference..
1E6323E1 (Top Dog GOLD)	   2EE3FEA1 (GSP)	
576E446C (Top Dog SILVER)	67EE992C (Martial Arts)	
8C79ECFB (Retro Triad)	AC8D6F78 (High Roller)
BCF931BB (Police Protection) 	C8F81F7D (Triad Enforcer)	
D500D5B5 (Deep Undercover)	E58008F5 (Red Envelope)

the GOLD and SILVER dlcs spoils gameplay a lot, while the high roller and red envelop spoils early gameplay with easy money (so does Cockfighting - no dlc required) .. outfits destroy gameplay if used in missions"
,suckerp,2012-08-28T13:39Z,"hi guys, sleeping dogs works for me without the dlcs, im using unlocked version 1.4 and now i overwrote with this dlcs and the game wont start. i click on hkship and it just wont start. nothing happens. can u please tell me how to make this work?"
,Deik,2012-08-29T03:14Z,will this work with the nosteam release?
,dandalis,2012-08-29T12:04Z,does this work with NOS Team release ?
,arjay45,2012-08-29T15:52Z,Doesn't work with Sleeping Dogs 1.4
,riposate,2012-08-30T13:27Z,anyone have an idea how to make it work for VANSIK's release?
,OmniNegro,2012-08-30T15:03Z,"Anyone know what versions of the game this *Does* work with? What release, and what version number and whatever else?

Thanks in advance."
,OmniNegro,2012-08-30T15:12Z,"Also, on another note, DLC is pure excrement. As an idea it is purely to make insane profit with minimal work by basically letting people cheat.

Also, the very term DLC is ambiguous. It can mean little shit that helps you cheat, or it can mean an expansion to the actual game. Usually there is much of the former, and only a few tiny smidgens of the latter.

As nignug said, this is the future of gaming. You buy an overpriced game for more than a days fair wage, and then you spend a weeks wage to get the little cheat shit that makes the game super-easy.

Try them if you want. You should have the self-control to avoid using them if they are too easy."
,T3st1fy,2012-09-02T23:51Z,got it to run once after adding the dlcs though my 1.4 trainer stopped working then so i dont know if it changes the version? but now the game wont launch anymore gonna try putting old crack back in
,T3st1fy,2012-09-03T00:05Z,after i copied and pasted using the skidrow version 1.4 it ran once with dlc working just fine i closed game re-launched and then it would not work anymore.... 
,gerald9087,2012-09-03T13:26Z,does this work with version 1.3??
,gerald9087,2012-09-03T15:59Z,why does my sleeping dogs crashed when im putting the DLC in the directory can someone please help me :(
,F1Z1KAL,2012-09-03T18:41Z,Does this work with the STEAM version?
,T3st1fy,2012-09-04T01:00Z,and by the way why the fuck would they put a autosave in there and not mention that copying and pasting everything like it tells you to do will overwrite your last autosave so ya better have some other saves...
,T3st1fy,2012-09-04T01:44Z,this only works with version 1.5 i finally got it to work after doing a fresh install of skidrow version then using skidrow update to 1.5 then using this now i have all DLC and it works everytime just dont forget to save your savegames if you feel the need to start fresh like i did....
