,gravitysewers,2012-08-27T19:25Z,Thank you. You're awesome for uploading all of this!
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-27T20:23Z,"You're most welcome, gravitysewers. Just doing my part to keep paying the shares forward."
,whaletail935,2012-09-01T20:22Z,"I actually registered with TPB so that I might properly thank you for uploading such exceptional material.  Really looking forward to reading this, the Warren Dracula and the Ott books.  

Finally, as a horror comics fan, I'd love to see you delve further in that direction with future uploads.  Insofar as you're obliged, of course.

Thanks again for for all of your efforts."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-09-03T09:57Z,"Hey, thanks whaletail935! Makes it worth the effort to know that people appreciate some of these old and unusual books.

Yeah, I've got plenty more horror, but not a lot of very OLD horror. More 80s up to current. I'll pick some stuff out (already got some ideas), but if you have any suggestions I'm happy to upload 'em if I've got 'em."
