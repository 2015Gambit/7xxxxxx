,jj_13,2012-09-02T11:18Z,It works! At first it didn't though. I followed the instruction but the serial didn't work. So I disabled my internet again then right click on tmaster8.net and checked the read only attribute and click on apply. Then open the program and tried entering the serial again and serial finally went through :) Thanks!
