It's a little disingenuous for me to ask you for anything, since you've been my sugar daddy all year long, but could you upload a lower-res version of this game?  My lowly little GeForce 5600 can't handle HD video."
,drew1972,2012-08-28T17:33Z,"nut4f1 eats his words.  I downloaded this version, intending to move it to a better computer to watch it, but, lo and behold, it works fine on my GeForce 5900.  Thanks once  more footy, and I'll never doubt you again."
