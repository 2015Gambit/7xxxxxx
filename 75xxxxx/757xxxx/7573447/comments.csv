[V],psspss,2012-08-27T10:16Z,"theres some pixels for a few seconds in 2 places.. 
the tv sources werent as good as the web sources
from last week but its very watchable for the size"
,xpmule,2012-08-27T12:34Z,"i was thinking about creating some torrents for the dvd rips for season 1,2,3. dynasty101, created the only dvd rips i can find but i think they are slightly over-sized and more importantly the quality is awful !
It has taken me days to convert the videos of his but its worth it, they look way nicer !

Here is a list of things i fixed.
- Size (now there exactly 350mb each)
- Picture quality (removed scanlines 95%)
- Aspect ratio (corrected to 4:3)
- Picture (cropped out random uneven small black bars)
- Resolution (resize to 640x480 bicubic for sharpness)
- codec (xvid 955kbps + packed bitstream)
- Audio (lowered bitrate to 128 cbr joint stereo)
And i have verified that they are running smoothly no stuttering that happens with avi's sometimes (had to run them through Divx++ to repair the container after Avidemux)
other wise they were spiking the cpu up and stuttering.
Also i verified every episode's audio is synced properly. Lastly the audio/video streams were re-encoded 1 single time. I hate re-encoding videos unless its obviously needed all it usually does is degrade the content.

So what do you think sound interesting ?"

[V],psspss,2012-08-27T12:43Z,"I have all the episodes as they came out as xvids
they do me fine. 

dvd is better if the tv rips have too many big defacing logos but cant remember as been a while
since I was the 3 seasons.

im sure someone will want better dvdrips if they
want to replace their tv rips or new to survivor man"
[V],psspss,2012-08-27T12:45Z,"meGUI freetool will do it all in one

and can sync audio or fix headers with
avimuxgui"
[V],psspss,2012-08-27T13:23Z,"Get the full details what les is doing on his website here.. you notice he even calls them specials not new season
http://lesstroud.ca/news/survivorman-returns

however not sure by the heading if hes filming more 10 day specials .. which would be good if he was.. must be a good money maker for him.. run low of cash,.. go out make another special :)"
[V],psspss,2012-08-28T03:08Z,"

Note SEEDING THIS NOW.. noticed many hit and runs...

I shared ratio 2.0

and I got40gb left ot last 20 days!"
,xpmule,2012-08-28T11:43Z,"almost done repairing 3 seasons.
not sure if i will upload them but i probably should. the 1st dvd is 4:3 and the 2nd and 3rd dvd's are 16:9 and the ripper fucked up the aspect ratios bad on every episode. combine that with scanlines, their just aweful looking. the scan lines are so distracting to me its unwatchable.
But the deinterlace filter works shockingly well. they look and run great and match the scene standard exactly (350mb xvid/mp3/avi)"
,clikaroo,2012-09-01T04:43Z,"Gotta take some time to thank you psspss for upping all the obscure stuff I'd never otherwise get to see. And you're comments are always worth the read as well, I remember TNE giving you grief in one thread for bothering to explain what his torrent actually was - was not cool IMO. 

Any word on when the second part of his ""stranded in a car"" scenario (or episode 4) is coming?"
[V],psspss,2012-09-10T12:31Z,"I see they still calling them season 4 even though
Ive explained it.. LOL

but yeh the last p2 of car one is coming out in 10min stay tuned

tne is ok.. I just pay attention to him half the time is all some people worry to much and egos etc

but I like to name a show correctly els eit gets messy like some many scene numbering for shows like storage wars texas pawn stars etc
and rolling back names"
