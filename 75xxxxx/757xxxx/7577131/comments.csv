But i'm getting old and lazy lol

2nd I tested this a few ways with and with out a key in the registry and it made no difference the reg key settings are ignored and so is the name field.. so it says registered to (blank space)
I used Nirsoft RunAsDate to try and test the trial period time bomb and that seemed to work but i can't know for sure unless i roll my bios forward or something and again i'm too lazy for that.. Actualy i'm too lazy to crack software so people should be surprised this got me off my ass lol
I like this program though and I'm a cheap bastard muahhaa lol"

But....

If anyone wants to re-share this ANYWHERE or make their own crack / patch out of it then please do. If you simply copy and paste my cracked .exe then please let people know i cracked it so they can find an update etc later if needed.. aside from that i don't care what people do.. go nuts :)"
