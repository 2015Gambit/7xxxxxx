=====================================PART 1==========================================

Forewarned and with a sense of foreboding, The Doctor races to return to Earth fearing that The Master will somehow return. He has good reason to worry since The Masters minions have in fact found a way to reconstitute him. Re-united with Wilfred Mott, The Doctor desperately tries to locate The Master only to find that he is being held by Joshua and Abigail Naismith who are using alien technology to create a new future for Earth. It's too late however, for The Master has now turned everyone on Earth into his own image. Little does he realize the greater danger that awaits them all.

=====================================PART 2==========================================

With almost everyone on Earth now recast in his image, The Master controls the world. He's shocked however when he realizes that one person hasn't changed. The Doctor soon realizes that the Time Lords are trying to return and re-establish Gallifrey. If they succeed, it is the end of time and the Doctor as we currently know him. Realizing that the Ood's prophecy will come true, he visits friends from the recent past.
