,MISFIT---420,2012-08-27T04:26Z,the Avast keys are for DEMO and TRIAL versions. why upload this bullshit dude ? do you not check you shit? obviously not. If you dont check simple shit like this my guess is that a lot of you software torrents are riddled with viruses 
,NepsterJay,2012-08-27T05:57Z,"I dont use avast antivirus. I use kaspersky and it is working about key i don't have all antivirus loaded in my computer and taking about other torrents i do check them if there is virus or not. And all torrents i have uploaded does not mean i use all the software  i upload them because i think that might help other user who use them.

Peace!!

I can vouch for NepsterJay - some of his keys DO work, and others don't for obvious reasons. The most obvious being it has been already used."
