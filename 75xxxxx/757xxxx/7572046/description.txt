To Complete PSX Vol B part 5 (originally from tim2251337x)

Are you like me? Been stuck at 99.1% for nearly a year with this torrent? Time for an alternative.  Simplest thing to do is post the files that wonΓÇÖt complete, eh? In Vol. B part 5 there are small fragments missing from the following games:

Bugriders - The Race of Kings
Bust-a-Move 2 - Arcade Edition
Bust-a-Move '99
Buster Bros. Collection

Unfortunatley, I cannot replace the files in tim2251337x's torrent because these are different rips than his (believe me I tried, utorrent comes back with huge errors).  At least this way you can complete the collection for yourself, and if just maybe, someone could repost the entire torrent?!?! (I lack the bandwidth to do so). If YOU have the bandwidth and some time, please consider it for the rest of us.

Also, please remember, you will still need the rest of Vol. B part 5 if you want all the other games and emulator files.  This post only has the files that will not complete.
  
One more inportant point: If you have the other 99.1% of the original torrent YOU MUST CONTINUE TO SEED BOTH his and mine, until someone reposts a new complete torrent!  Don't down it and run, share the love, man! : )

Of course, if one of you do actually repost a new complete Vol B part 5, please come back here and tell us all!

Just for reference, the original torrent is here:
