Hello Fine fellow pirateers! Here is my first upload ever! It's a collection of what I believe to be 50 Cent's best songs to bump loud! I've compiled them from various of his albums and others he was featured in. It's up to date as of 8/27/2012. I hope you enjoy this effort...I know you will. Please seed! This file is in Mp3 format and are all great quality! I've also included an album cover I made for all you iTunes buffs!
