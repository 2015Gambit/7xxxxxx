------------------------------

Jimmy's Forest 
High up in a spectacular tree house, Jimmy Doherty develops an intimate understanding of the inner workings of a British forest. Country boy and farmer Jimmy Doherty is as happy as a pig in... Well, in a very nice pigsty. Holed up in a spectacular tree house, he's charting the seasonal changes of a Norfolk wood. Which means dissecting woodpeckers, eating roadkill, drinking sap from a tree and tracking deer. There are some brilliant nuggets of information and Jimmy's enthusiasm for the great outdoors is very infectious.


1)  Spring 
Spring is in the air and Jimmy delights in exploring his wood and showing us how the forest is coming to life. He finds out how to get a drink straight from a tree, gets to grips with a woodpecker, squabbles with squirrels and makes himself roadkill badger ham. He even creates his own 'hands-on' experiments to help him reveal what blue tits and butter icing have in common...
