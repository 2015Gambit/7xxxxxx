If you're gonna go through the trouble to rip to FLAC, please spend an extra 5 seconds and compress to level 8.
Like many people, I have thousands of FLAC files that will be kept for many years, so it makes sense to make them as small as possible for everyone.
It's not like going 2 more steps degrades the sound on a lossless format - smaller is better!"
[V],Kitlope,2012-08-29T19:21Z,does it really fucking matter?
,eroticburps,2012-08-31T17:09Z,"haha.. joke of the day. why don't people download 128kbps audio if they are so specific about filesize. infact Iron Maiden is a band to be owned on Original Cd's. why do these people even listen to metal??? sounds cheap, does'nt it?????

no offence iPlunder..
