Who is Sonia Gandhi?? There is officially NO Sonia Gandhi. 

Her real name in passport is neither Gandhi nor Sonia. Its Edvige Antonia Albina Maino. 
Sonia is a Russian name and not italian. However, Antonia is an italian name and her passport is italian. Though she has married Rajiv Gandhi* she never accepted change of title officially. ( recall the time of turmoil in indian politics when Sonia Gandhi was trying to be the prime minister, but ultimately ManMohan Singh became her toy)
