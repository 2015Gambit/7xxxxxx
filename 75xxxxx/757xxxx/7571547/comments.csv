,tonytiger01,2012-09-15T22:35Z,"Why can't you use rar like everyone else on the planet? Wia is a bunch of crap. its saves almost nothing in space and is a pain in the butt to unzip.
You aren't helping anyone when you use wia you are just making more unnecessary work "
,dt7ll5op,2012-09-15T23:39Z,"youre wrong, there is at least one man on the planet im helping - myself.
