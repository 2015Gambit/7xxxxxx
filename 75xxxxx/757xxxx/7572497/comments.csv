A Touch of Cloth is an all-encompassing parody of every police procedural ever written. It stars John Hannah (The Mummy, Spartacus) as DCI Jack Cloth - a maverick, heavy drinking loner who has thrown himself into his work following the mysterious death of his wife. The damaged, haunted Cloth is teamed with plucky no-nonsense sidekick DC Anne Oldman, played by Suranne Jones (Coronation Street, Unforgiven). Together the pair investigate a series of increasingly grisly murders and find themselves on the trail of a devious killer. As you do. If youâre a detective. (Source: Sky Entertainment)
