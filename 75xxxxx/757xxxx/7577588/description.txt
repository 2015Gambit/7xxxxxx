"Keating Hotel"

Award-winning chef and hospitality expert 
Gordon Ramsay takes on another struggling 
hotel. This week Ramsay checks into The 
Keating Hotel in San Diego, CA. The 
Keating, located in the city's iconic 
Gaslamp Quarter, is a 35-room boutique 
hotel in debt and in crisis. The owner 
looks to Gordon to help him turn the hotel 
around. Gordon immediately sees issues 
with the dcor, the room service, the 
laundry service, hotel restaurant MerK 
Bistro and the owner's own managerial 
style. Will The Keating's boss swallow his 
pride and agree to the changes that Ramsay 
suggests or will he push back.
