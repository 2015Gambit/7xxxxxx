The third in Gilbert HernandezΓÇÖs line of original hardcovers featuring Love and RocketsΓÇÖ ΓÇ£FritzΓÇ¥ (Luba's half-sister) in her guise as a Z-movie actress (the first two were Chance in Hell and The Troublemakers) is a trippy thriller that stars Fritz in no fewer than three roles.

A beautiful waitress (Fritz, of course) and her hospital nurse brother (also Fritz) visit their estranged father, a once successful but now retired writer (amazingly enough, also Fritz), in order to find out the true reason why their mother committed suicide. When dadΓÇÖs health fails, the siblings are then more concerned with the money he might leave them.

The story weaves in and out of reality and hallucination and possibly back in forth in time, and to complicate things further, the sister is sexually obsessed with a mysterious man throughout the tale ΓÇö or is it her brother (at one point posing as his sister so that he might gain his and her inheritance) that is so hot and bothered by this mystery stud? And thatΓÇÖs only the tip of the iceberg. ThereΓÇÖs also a venture into ghost territory, with frauds bilking the gullible and FritzΓÇÖs character(s) right in the middle.
