Lemon said: "Really excited for Lemon La Vida Loca. Its been an
incredible ride that Ive been riding and now viewers will be able
to come along ont ride with me.

four-part 45-minute show is the only way people will be able to
experience being me, without actually being me. I hope me bird
dont mind cameras int bedroom."
