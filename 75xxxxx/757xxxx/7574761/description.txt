It's a decrapped .Sims3Pack file, just put it into the Download folder, start the launcher and simply install!
Don't forget to update to latest patch before you install!

Enjoy!

ps.: it has got two premium items, since it's the deluxe (gold) edition, which does not work because of decrap, so please do not post u got problems with them, just wait for my August store pack, you'll find the fix there! It's coming in few days!
