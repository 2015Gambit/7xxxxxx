,srg1974,2012-09-03T03:27Z,Stupid question. For some reason this shows up simply as FILE after downloading. Not a .package or Sims3pack. How would I open this? Thanks
,admz0r,2012-09-03T13:32Z,Its a sim3pack......
,philoz494,2012-09-04T20:05Z,"I have a problem, when i installed sunlit tides sims3pack, it says that it requires the latest software update. I've installed your The_Sims_3_Store-August_2012_Update-admz0r (.sim3pack/.package) already"

,admz0r,2012-09-05T18:07Z,:DD then install the latest update lol just try to read&understand next time:D
,Cameron1124,2012-09-05T21:01Z,admz0r could u please help me. I downloaded sunlit tides and it shows up as a file. So i put it in my download folder and it still doesnt show for me to install. My game is upto date also. Could u please explain what im doing wrong and how to do it correctly? 
,admz0r,2012-09-06T13:16Z,"First u have to put it into the downloads folder and then open ur sims 3 launcher and install, or if this somehow doesnt working just simply double click to the file u downloaded and wait until it installs"
,540howdy,2012-09-06T22:51Z,"Could you upload in .package file?
I think in this format, it conflicts with the august update.. I mean if you use .package for that and use installer for this. The game won't launch and you have to delete this to run it."
,admz0r,2012-09-08T13:02Z,No lol. Read the god damn description in the august upd torrent.... It contains two premium items and the august upd also has this two item.. Its for the ppl who dont wanna install this neighborhood.. Simply dont download and read the desc lol
