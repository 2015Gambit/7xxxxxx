When Homicide Detective Jacob Striker discovers that a string of recent suicides might actually be covered-up murders, his investigation quickly leads him to the Riverglen Mental Health Facility. The victims were all patients from the support group overseen by psychologist Dr. Erich Ostermann. And when Striker discovers Larisa Logan - a dear friend of his, and a patient of Ostermann - has gone missing, his investigation goes into overdrive. Time is running out. And the evidence tells him one very important fact: that Larisa knows something about the murders. Even worse, she is trapped. She can't return to the hospital because her own life is in danger. Larisa's only chance for living is to escape. Racing against time and a chilling adversary, Striker searches desperately for Larisa. It is a dangerous game they play. Where one right step can catapult you to a place of dominance - and one wrong step can leave you sliding to your doom. It is a game of psychopaths. It is Snakes & Ladders.
