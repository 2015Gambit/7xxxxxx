,Grindcorejihad,2012-08-29T02:45Z, PURE ART!
,Dave8986,2012-08-29T06:15Z,"Horrible ending, fast forward through half the movie or you will fall asleep and then delete the file after you say WTF I WASTED MY TIME!"
,gabriel1475,2012-08-29T08:42Z,"dave is right, you will indeed hate this movie,

if you are a complete idiot, I mean.

if you have the attention span of a gerbil, and like dave probably assume that Transformers is one of the greatest films ever made, then yes, you will be angry after seeing this.

also, if you have a learning disability, live in Alabama, shop at walmart, drive a truck that your mom cant get into without help or a small step ladder, live in Alabama, love action films, live in Alabama, love how cozy it is on your trailer, and...

Live in Alabama!

then you most probably will find this to be a slow and boring film."

That said, I'll probably have to watch this when my wife isn't asking me questions every ten seconds and then waiting till we're 30 minutes in to announce she's bored and this is too slow for her."
