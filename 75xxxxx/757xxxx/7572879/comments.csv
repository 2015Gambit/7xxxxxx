,nickie1801,2012-09-07T19:25Z,"just a question: after the activation, is it good to update the office, or will it break the activation? can it re-activate after an update as well?"
,VerifiedFiles,2012-09-09T23:14Z,"@nickie1801
If you update the office it will break the activation.. but after you finnish the update, if you run this again, it will active again."
,REOSpeedwagon,2012-09-11T00:16Z,"I cloned my hard drive which contained Office 2010 which was permanently activated.  After opening Outlook on the new drive I got the dreaded ""hardware change detected"" message and was unsuccessful in getting it re-activated when I called Microsoft. Anyway, this activator worked but when I checked the license info, it states valid for another 180 days.  So it appears the activator will have to be run again in 180 days.  "
