,maxmaxpayne,2012-08-28T15:49Z,"bloody one hit wonders that right comments to say there going to right a comment that they dont right, friggin one hit wonders."
,klip1,2012-08-28T16:10Z,"too grainy, imma wait.

thnx anyways tho hackulus"
,machv5,2012-08-28T17:01Z,Thanks for all the work you guys do. I know that it takes a lot of time and effort to tediously tweak and adjust picture quality and enhance the audio+sync. Keep up the good work. And to all those out there that may whine about this and that with the TS's don't watch it. Go buy the DVD or CAM your own then try to make it look nice enough to watch. After you have tried to make one yourself and create something that is better you have no right to get pissy about something you got for free.
,piranical,2012-08-28T18:26Z,"ok, i'd been looking forward to this movie & so i have dlded illuminati's - good v6a5, topsider's (aka anonymous) better v8.5a7, 26k - v8.5a6, NEW SOURCE CAM x264 AAC-UNiQUE - better again v9a7.5 and finally this one - best so far, although not as large screen resolution as unique's, but far better audio than the rest thanks to the ts,  v9.5a8.5."
,jason69bourne,2012-08-28T19:30Z,"OK i have seen all the other bourne movies, and read the books(all the books) and this movies is so fare off base from the book its like a whole new movie away from the book."
,jason69bourne,2012-08-28T19:35Z,"why call this a bourne movie, they should have called it the cross legacy had nothing to do with the book"
,Galtar0420,2012-08-28T20:21Z,"A=3

,cutiebugme2,2012-08-28T22:42Z,can you please get....What To Expect When You're Expecting! thanks
,Pmoney559,2012-08-29T00:03Z,Lol cam is far from shit. V-7.5 A-7 very watchable thnx for upload
,Mister08,2012-08-29T02:16Z,"A very nice cam. The video was quite watchable with only a small amount of fuzz occurring in darker scenes. While I found the audio quiet, even with good headphones to block out external noise; it was respectable quality.
So to all the people that have worked so hard on this *ESPECIALLY YOU HACKULUS!!!* Thankyou!

A6.5/V8 for a cam
Seeding but quite frankly my internet has atrocious speeds and I cant contribute as much as I would like!!"
,pxpierre,2012-08-29T02:21Z,Thank you Hackulus and seeders!

,tattoovic87,2012-08-29T12:38Z,to those of you who upload cams and call the telesceener you need to get a fuckin life
,Flyboy09,2012-08-29T12:42Z,thanks Hackulus as always you do good work
,YardBoy,2012-08-29T15:11Z,"+1 for the quality [and quantity] of so many contributors.  Re-paid in kind 4.10X.  You?
V7/A8 and very watchable for a TS."
,stevogaleb,2012-08-29T19:45Z,"Watched it last night.  Pretty decent cam.  Thanks again to Hackulus for another good upload.

V7/A7"
,Frank525,2012-08-29T21:13Z,"I'm pretty sure that hacks from the mpaa are purposely posting poor a/v ratings to discourage downloading. This is far from crap.

a:6
v:8"
,tops.c,2012-08-30T03:15Z,re-encode over and over WHY ?
,Galtar0420,2012-08-30T04:52Z,"Im not a hack for anyone. I downloaded it. I tried to watch it but the quality is just to pore to tolerate. The sound is like a phone on speaker at the other end of a tonal. The picture is dark and blurry. I rate it at 
V=4 A=3
Unwatchable in my opinion. "
,vatel88,2012-08-30T19:22Z,"STFU with all your comments of this is unwatchable video/audio ratings. Its TS of a movie not even close to DVD release so why complain you're getting it for free!

Lastly there is a sample file so download it and decide for yourself, that's why Up Loader's put them in their torrents."
,OHNO_Its_Johnny,2012-08-30T19:40Z,"you dont even know how to spell tunnel ""tonal"" or poor ""pore"" and i think you might of meant to write too instead of some of those ""to"" and your opinion sucks, so shut up and enjoy the movie, if it sucks so bad...then dont download it, all your doing is freeloading, you cant complain about free stuff you jackass."
,imbusy36,2012-08-31T04:22Z,PICTURE  IS  HORRIBLE
,imbusy36,2012-08-31T04:23Z,SORRY  WRONG  COMMENT
,blueskullking,2012-08-31T17:13Z,"All this guys torrents are filmed with a 1985 Sony cam corder, then burned from a potato to thepiratebay for ya'll. rofl"
,Sikkwolf,2012-08-31T19:49Z,"You people are fucking stupid, ""you don't have a right to complain about free stuff""... It's not FREE anymore you fucking niggers, every time someone downloads a torrent they run the risk of getting in trouble, so uploading shitty cams like this causes people to take a needless risk. It's one thing if the cam is a decent cam, it's another to upload total shit like this. 

So fuck every one of you pussy motherfuckers with your ingratiating niggershit, the uploader is not your fucking friend, he doesn't care about you licking his asshole, he probably didn't even watch this before he re-uploaded it. SO FUCK YOURSELVES RIGHT IN YOUR NIGGER ASSES YOU BITCH FACED CUNTS. 

PS - This is a fucking terrible copy, don't DL it. "
,Ssgtmcnasty,2012-09-02T10:28Z,"@Sikkwolf  Hey, your mom said to watch your mouth. Also, knock next time you go in her bedroom. I dont appreciate you tryin to peek in when my big black dick in her mouth....pervert.

As for the movie, I watched it all the way through, but it had to be done with headphones, and it was tough....barely watchable...barely.

A:3
V:3

Thanks for upload though."
,cynder76,2012-09-02T19:24Z,not watchable....... very grainy
,makreza,2012-09-13T12:21Z,"We all want Bourne, but this is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and Weisz were great, but I think the scripting has been derided by many as terrible. I had no issues with anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation.  I saw it with great quality on latest.haxshells.us and i recommend this movie to all, totally worth watching."
