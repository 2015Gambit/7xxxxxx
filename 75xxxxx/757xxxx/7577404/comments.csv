,jebusforlife,2012-09-03T01:44Z,Thumbs up :)
,777plus111,2012-09-04T04:59Z,"What does ""mont"" mean in the readme? Or can you provide more detailed instructions on how to install?"
,faisechelon,2012-09-04T13:04Z,doesnt work..the iso file opens a disc burner.. what should i do next?
,fashion1nako,2012-09-04T14:34Z,"@777plus111
*mount means when you open Daemon Tools and put in a virtual drive..you mount the .rar file..or .iso
you can also burn the .iso image on a disk and install it ;)"
,fashion1nako,2012-09-04T14:35Z,"@faisechelon
open Daemon Tools and mount the .iso image there
it will start the installation proccess on its own
if it doesn't, go to My Computer and run the virtual drive..."
,777plus111,2012-09-04T17:49Z,"Mounted the Iso file, installed the program. Got an "".net framework initalization error"" when I ran the ""toolkit"" but Office seems to be working fine, so i am not worried right now."
,Wehmer,2012-09-07T08:51Z,Absolutely flawless. Worked like a charm. Don't fret about the 'mounting' business. Just open the ISO folder with WinRAR and extract it :)
,Antarte,2012-09-07T21:02Z,Includes x86 and x64? Includes Visio too? thanks.
,vajesus,2012-09-09T19:58Z,"1. Extract Microsoft Office Enterprise 2010 Corporate.iso using Winrar
2. Run Setup.exe
3. Open MS 2010 Activator/Office 2010 Toolkit
4. Click EZ Activator (May Take A Few Minutes)
5. Enjoy."
,jbrandon12,2012-09-13T04:43Z,Works perfect!
,jbrandon12,2012-09-13T04:58Z,"perfect, but it is 32 bit or it installs by default that way.  How do I get it to install 64bit?"
,dredboi,2012-09-14T03:11Z,Thanks so much.. Everything installed perfectly just as you said. The only deviation for me (clean Windows 7 install) was I had to install .NET 4.0 to run the Activator. 
,babidoo,2012-09-14T15:16Z,"When I run the installation, and its done (the bar is completely green) it just gets stuck.. Nothing happens and it says ""Installing Microsoft Office... etc"" Just me?"
,TheFrankAttack,2012-09-15T01:42Z,"100% LEGIT. I love you, Anon. "
