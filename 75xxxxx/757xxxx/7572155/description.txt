Information about the game:
HALO takes place in the future, where humans are fighting a losing battle against the technologically superior "covenant," a group of alien beings driven by radical religious beliefs to destroy all humans. To make things worse, it appears they have found a new weapon of incredible power: "HALO," a mysterious and massive ring/space station orbiting a foreign world. As the game progresses, the player discovers an enemy even worse than the covenant: It would seem that while the covenant was attempting to activate halo, they inadvertently released "the flood," a vicious alien life form that survives by taking over the body of an organic host and then spreading to the next victim. Once released, "the flood" immediately begins possessing the covenant and humans alike, and the player realizes "the flood" must be stopped to prevent the destruction of the entire galaxy.
