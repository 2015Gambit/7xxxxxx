Flash Video Browser v1.10.0

Requirements: Android 2.1+

Feel free to update Flash. Should now support ICS, I hope. PLEASE EMAIL ME IF IT WORKS OR DOESN'T FOR YOU. Upon reading the flash player reviews for the official version of Adobe Flash Player it appears that full screen is broken on some galaxy nexus devices.

Please don't use full screen mode, I'm releasing a version soon that should make it so you don't need to, anyways.
Requires Flash Player 11 to be installed on your phone / device! Requires Android 2.3+. This browser will play any flash video as though it was on your computer. No more android being blocked, or "Video not available on mobile"! This should, in theory, let you watch any video that is normally blocked to mobile devices such as certain Youtube videos and probably even Hulu.
Now Fullscreens:
Youtube
CollegeHumor
Vimeo
Hulu

Great for pesky youtube videos that don't appear in the youtube app as well as other sites that block android devices outright.
