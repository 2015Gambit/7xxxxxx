,clear009,2012-08-26T10:13Z," I plan on uploading blitzkrieg antholgy as well later. If you like this, I have 2 dvd's (8 gigs) more of files for all the games that use the blitzkrieg engine..   Also for those who don't know you can click my name at the top of this page ""clear009"" for my uploads...."
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:20Z,Also I may need to turn my computer off for awhile for a lil maintenance. But keep your torrent program on cause I will continue seeding until there are at least 7-8 other people seeding it........
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:30Z,One more thing.. I mainly play WW2 games..100's... You name it I probably have it. So if you cant find one let me know and I will post it if I have it.
,motley666,2012-08-26T19:22Z,Does this pack include the movies of the game? I have TOED's version and movies are out to keep the size small. 
,clear009,2012-08-26T22:24Z,It's the Full version.. I bought it. This is straight from the cd.. Well except I found a crack for it and added it so others can play it.
,clear009,2012-08-26T22:32Z,"Also I have all the blitzkrieg 2 games with alot of extras as well. Blitzkrieg 2, Fall of the Reich, Liberation, and Frontline fields of thunder. With all patches, cracks,misc. files for example one makes the vegetation and vehicles look better, and mods with campaigns and missions. Also some files that make the harder blitzkrieg games easier like barbarossa, Kursk, liberation, fall of the reich and frontline fields of thunder. Some missions for those games seem impossible i have files to make them about as hard as the blitzkrieg 1 & 2.... "

,clear009,2012-09-06T00:29Z,Going to seed all my torrents for awhile since some people are getting it and not seeding and helping others who want it.. Plus I will post some more files for the blitzkrieg series.. If anyone is interested in any other WW2 games let me know I may have it.
