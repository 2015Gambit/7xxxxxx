If you want us to use the 777 you uploaded: 

1. You first have to delete your registry settings concerning the 777 (should be in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software(((/Wow6432Node----ONLY x64 SYSTEMS)))/CaptainSim/x770) (do this only if it's actually activated and you have 1 or 2 online registrations left)

2. Enter in the setup of the 777 and generate a code for an OFFLINE activation

3. go there with the txt file generated h**p://www.captainsim.com/activ/offline.php
(http)

4. follow the instructions 

5. upload here in tpb the .key file generated by c*ptain sim. With this .key file, you'll be able to reinstall the 777 a thousand times and that, even if you activated online 3 times the product! And so, us, leechers, can use the product too!
