[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-28T15:00Z,not sure what Jack Wagner and Leslie Anne Down are doing right now..!! ItÂ´s a shame they have been let go..I totally love Leslie Anne Down...!! So gad I got the chance to meet her last year at the B&B fan event in Los Angeles...such a wonderful Lady...!! 
,bleslie1,2012-08-28T17:08Z,"Both Jack Wagner and Leslie Anne Down were fired by B. Bell months ago because he's trying to attract a younger audience for B&B. He's doing away with all the veteran actors of the show and putting the all focus on Hope, Steffy, & Liam :(

He also fired the guy who played Owen, and the girl who plays Amber has been demoted to recurring status...

,Dimmis80,2012-08-28T17:42Z,Wow MsFenmore lucky u girl that u manage to meet Leslie and to see the event and stuff..I totally ungree Leslie is one of my favorite in bold and in other series and stuff that did and does in her carier.To be honest i would love one day to meet in event like this Susan Flanery and Katherine-Brook witch i totaly find 2 of the most beautifull women and talendet of the show world.Very difficult to happen for me again to be honest but u never know what plans have the life for u..bleslie1 mate thanks for the info and i have thought about that they were fired and Owen and Amber to and thats is sad because the Marone family and Amber was lovely guys and stuff..And about younger people i am kinda young in my 30s but i still like the most the 4 musketeers the 4 oldest of the show and the older guys play and have more fun than the new ones like Stefy-Hope and the poor Liam kid.!!LOL.Anyways what can we do if u watch soaps for a very long time u can't just stop watch it for stuff like that only just if the soap goes down so we are done about this show.!We will see.Cheers to u all guys.:-)
