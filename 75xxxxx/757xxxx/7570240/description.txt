* In an interview I read back in Summer/Fall of 1993 (think it was 
RELIX magazine), the interviewer wrote that he told Jerry and Bobby 
a couple days before the show that a 'cassidy' > 'uj band' > 'cassidy' 
would be a good pairing.  He wrote how surprised he was that the band
actually did it.  Apparently it didn't work as well as the band intended
and never paired them together again.
