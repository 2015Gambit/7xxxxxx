Thanks Yif"

A 5 for the movie is still a bit generous. The main reason this movie should be seen is that it stands as a warning of what catastrophe can occur when marketers technicians and background artists are given access to the script. And it's so easily and cheaply avoidable. Walk into any pub in London and you can find at least a dozen starving writers trying to drink themselves to death. Buy any one of them a case of warm beer and they'll write you a script a thousand times better than this one."

Well yeah but I fell for the love couple in the movie. I also liked the animation and environment. But it is nothing compare to Ghiblis films. "
