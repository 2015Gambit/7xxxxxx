,kingda74,2012-08-30T22:13Z,"@TvTeam   You are the shiznits for having this before Sept 18..  I mean you deserve a high five, something that hasn't been given from me since '97..  This copy is wonderful, and I can only say that word twice a month without being called gay..  Consider yourselves lucky :)

Audio/Video=7/10
Movie: 10  Katt Williams is the best since Dave Chappelle.  Kevin Hart is okay but lets face it, he's not one of the best.  Katt talks about real shit the entire show, everyone laughs not knowing he is putting his livelihood and life on the line discussing these topics.  Few will know what I'm talking about, so to those with ears..  Our flight to heaven should be leaving soon :)"
