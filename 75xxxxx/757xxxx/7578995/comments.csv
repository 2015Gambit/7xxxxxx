,Fantomnz,2012-09-03T13:33Z,"First Many Many Thanks to scene4all!!!!!!!

Iv ben playin ME for almost 4yrs!!!!

Latest update bit gutted with the leviathan dlc (dosnt deserve capitals!!!)

So finished another run through game play 35mins guess others are slow but had all the achivements sucessfull at the end so that was it then!!! Sad hoped for alot more.

Anyways the dlc installs fine and after palaven you can access it on your private console :)

If your good at this game its over to quickly but cant nock the quality movie animation all the way.

I do have another question any info or variables to get the TIM ""The Ilussive Man"" to shoot himself at the end?

Unless there is more which suspect there is as there are planets I cant access on the map Im now gona do the Leviathan part once more and move on :)

Maybe another dlc just to bug the fark out of me coming soon LOL

Bio have let us all down in the end with the wishy washy endings (leaving a opening for another sequal alltough it would have to be FFFFFFFFFNNNNNNNN good to better the last two IMO) The pack changed nothing at the end, was hoping Shep mite have at least rised!!

Fantomnz, you have to use paragon options in every conversation with the Illusive Man through the game to get him to do that.

People having the ladder problem, try changing your game resolution to 800x600 and constantly look up while using the ladder (so that you don't see the ladder at all). This worked for me, although it took a few tries."
