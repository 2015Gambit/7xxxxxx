.much appreciated"
,dt7ll5op,2012-08-29T13:27Z,"download WIT from http://wit.wiimm.de/download.html (assuming youre using windows: http://wit.wiimm.de/download/wit-v2.07a-r3955-cygwin.zip ), uncompress the downloaded .zip file with something like winzip somewhere in your path (that means somewhere where can and usually you run commands from), open a command shell from where you placed the downloaded .wia and type quote: wit copy ""Williams Pinball Classics [RWCP6M].wia"" --wbfs %X
or use the word convert instead of copy if you dont want to keep the original .wia file"
,winkywoowaa,2012-08-29T15:44Z,"thanks for the quick reply dude...I struggled abit with your method (I told you I was thick), anyways after a bit of googleing I came across a program called wii backup fusion that sorted it for me..hope this helps any other dumbass out there...and again thanks for sharing man"
