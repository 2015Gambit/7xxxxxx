Polyamory: Married & Dating S01E07 - We Are One

In the season finale, Anthony, Lindsey and Vanessa have their commitment ceremony with the pod attending.

This episode aired on Aug 23, 2012. As far as I know, this is the only release of this episode at the moment. Unfortunately, I didn't record S01E01.

Series Info from the show's website: "This provocative reality series takes an inside look at non-monogamous, committed relationships that involve more than two people.  Lindsey and Anthony are married and live in a triad (three-way relationship) with their girlfriend, Vanessa.  Husband and wife Michael and Kamala (who have a young son) are adjusting to having two of their lovers, fellow married couple Jen and Tahl, move in with them.  This explicit look at modern-day polyamory follows characters grappling with the emotional and sexual drama of sharing their hearts, as well as their beds."
