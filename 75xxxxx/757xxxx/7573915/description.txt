The Laughter of God, and More Laughter are two books of philosophy by John Roland Stahl, including many essays on a wide variety of subjects: social, economic, and political philosophy, in addition to the metaphysics drawn from Pythagoras, Hermetic Alchemy, the Kabbalah, and the I Ching.  Tetragrammaton is an outline of the Keys of the Mysteries based on the insight of Pythagoras that the Numbers of Mathematics are the most abstract and original symbols of the Mysteries of Nature, illuminating the meaning of the Tree of Life of the Kabbalah and the Tetragrammaton, the four letter Name of God, the meaning of which has been assumed to have been lost.
