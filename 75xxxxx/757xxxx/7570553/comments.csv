,clear009,2012-08-26T10:12Z," I plan on uploading blitzkrieg antholgy as well later. If you like this, I have 2 dvd's (8 gigs) more of files for all the games that use the blitzkrieg engine..   Also for those who don't know you can click my name at the top of this page ""clear009"" for my uploads.."
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:20Z,Also I may need to turn my computer off for awhile for a lil maintenance. But keep your torrent program on cause I will continue seeding until there are at least 7-8 other people seeding it...
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:30Z,One more thing.. I mainly play WW2 games..100's... You name it I probably have it. So if you cant find one let me know and I will post it if I have it....
,motley666,2012-08-26T19:23Z,"Is this game good? I am a big fan of the BK series, i have the Anthology and i still play it. Thanks for uploading all these games, i appreciate it mate."
,clear009,2012-08-26T22:22Z,Yea  its pretty good. As I'm sure you already know.. Its the successor to Burning Horizon. Plus I have About 10 more gigs of Blitzkrieg files mods  etc.... 
,motley666,2012-08-27T20:10Z,"I think the other name of this game is panzerkrieg, am i right? If so, i know i have seen some screenshots but the game is in german language?"
,DarkJediLV,2012-08-28T18:16Z,"i remember there was a mod called silent pacific storm for blitzkrieg. ;) it would be awesome if you could upload it, if you have it, since i am a big buff of pacific theatre.
btw, will seed most of your torrents for a week or so. much appriecieted."
,clear009,2012-09-06T00:26Z,Going to seed all my torrents for awhile since some people are getting it and not seeding and helping others who want it.. 
,clear009,2012-09-06T00:31Z,Plus I will post some more files for the blitzkrieg series.. If anyone is interested in any other WW2 games let me know I may have it. 
,clear009,2012-09-06T08:16Z,Yes motley666 it is also called panzerkrieg. But this is the english version.
