[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-26T15:20Z,"Enjoy Sleeping Dogs, repack by BlackBox! :)

Seeding with 200mbit/s but would be happy if you continue seeding too so people can DL faster! :)"
,sami_nasri,2012-08-26T15:46Z,So nothing's ripped.not what we expect from BB but thanks anyway
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-26T15:54Z,"@sami_nasri, well all languages are removed except english, so this got English only.
And as usually on BlackBox releases, their own installer is very compressed :)"
,rxanp,2012-08-26T16:24Z,"to be honest, its a little too good to be true...
1.4 update and the skidrow fix..??"
,mching,2012-08-26T16:30Z,"I have to say, the significantly reduced filesize (compared to what others are uploading) is really something. I do hope you haven't compromised anything that might affect the quality of the game.

Also, I have to commend you guys for releasing this torrent. There has been a number of fragmented torrents without the patch, or crack, nor the hd packs. So It's nice to see all the stuff in a single package. More power to you guys."
,tufel,2012-08-26T17:38Z,Do the DLC's work in this rip??
,The012Freak,2012-08-26T18:29Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister
Thank you for uploading this torrent really quick after the release, was waiting for black box repack of this game for so long.. :)"

,xnate128x,2012-08-26T19:31Z,"Time and time again I am unable to download this game, and others recently. It keeps telling me that the buddha.dll file is missing and can't run the game. Can anyone help me with this issue? Please and thank you. "
,Aoishiro,2012-08-26T19:58Z,"anyone who already download this, could you please confirm whether this worked or not. i really wish for a no headache version of this game. previously ez and skidrow combo always present itself as a no headache version. install and copy cracked and it worked, but this game is an exception. theres a lot of people who said oh i got it to work this way, but there's always someone who dispute that. i haven;t download any version of this game yet, limited bandwidth prevent me to do so. kaos, blackbox, skidrow, repack vansik, limited editon, dlc, 1.4. crack fix, NEW crack fix. 3dm, TFK guy's upload fix, there's one by user aviara. .dude's upload, heromaster one. which one is it? please advice, thx."
,The012Freak,2012-08-26T20:39Z,"@xnate128x
Probably your anti-virus is blocking or deleted buddha.dll, Anti-virus picks up buddha.dll as virus but it's not.... The game needs buddha.dll to run..So trying blocking u'r anti-virus on buddha.dll, if the file is deleted so copy budhha.dll from crack folder(not included in black-box ver) and paste it in the game installation folder..."
,The012Freak,2012-08-26T20:46Z,"@Aoishiro
This version is probably working, Black box does not release the games without testing it, if the game works then only they will do a repack, that's why it took them this long to release the repack of this game, i have downloaded plenty of games from blackbox all works without any problem, I presume this is also working, but you can wait till someone confirm that this repack is working. Usually BB repack works like a charm without any problems..."
,Hugotoxx,2012-08-26T20:57Z,"@Aoishiro I have downloaded this and it is not working for me like all those torrents (I have tried each release), patches and fixes you  mentioned, none of them worked for me, I could make the game run, but there is so many bugs that is not worth to play otherwise you will ruin the game experience.Im dissapointed because I usually make work like 99% torrents .THis one I really want so  I decided to buy game tomorrow"
,paperboy666,2012-08-26T21:57Z,not working
,damonj,2012-08-27T03:03Z,it doesn't even start
,piraatbreker,2012-08-27T06:22Z,Mr. Stifmeister your the man I'll always wait for the blackbox release confirm it's working fine so far no crashes encountered to those who complained the game is not working just buy the fucking game to support the company you asshole or may be time to upgrade your ancient Hardware ha ha ha ;-)
,mching,2012-08-27T12:51Z,"Downloaded and playing. 

Issues:

1. buddha.dll is still recognized as a virus so it is always automatically deleted or quarantined. (Which may be the reason why the game won't launch for others) Simply add it to the exclusions and restore the deleted/quarantined dll.
2. The game crashes when you hit the ESC key. So you can't pause the game or go to the main menu. "
,hammer2085,2012-08-27T15:42Z,Can anyone confirm if it includes patch v1.4 & is working? 
,abhishek551,2012-08-27T16:11Z,"works like a charm

,xnate128x,2012-08-28T00:36Z,"I am unable to start the game as well.  I click on the hkship file and the launcher.  A window pops up for both, but it just disappears.  Can anyone help me?  Please and thank you."
,xnate128x,2012-08-28T00:40Z,"I was able to play transformers fall of cybertron after deactivating my antivirus, so I know that isn't the issue on why this game doesn't even start up.  Any suggestions? "
,krityaros,2012-08-28T06:11Z,"THE GAME DOESN'T START BECAUSE YOUR ANTIVIRUS DELETES THE DLL, RETRIEVE THE DLL FROM THE QUARANTINE? AND THEN ADD IT TO EXCEPTIONS.
This release works perfectly, if you can't run it, buy the game."
,Cerebral222,2012-08-28T07:30Z,"Thanks Mr.Stifmeister, excellent torrent, works perfectly, +1 from me, cheers."

,xnate128x,2012-08-28T18:26Z,"There has to be another reason there bud.  I have my firewall, and antivirus programs turned off when I install the game and try to launch it.  My .dll files are still there after launching."
,demon_man,2012-08-28T22:41Z,"Same problem here, game doesnt start up at all :/"
,The012Freak,2012-08-28T23:01Z,"FOR ALL THOSE GAME IS NOT LAUNCHING FOLLOW THIS(this one worked for me).

Alright i downloaded the game and installed it, Blocked HKship.exe in firewall and added exception buddha.dll from my antivirus, unfortunately game didn't launch for me at first :(, so i did the following(this worked for me).

1.I Downloaded  steam and update it(not so sure the game requires steam, but i read somewhere that it does.)

IMPORTANT
2. I Downloaded 10 DLC pack+Crack fix( google for it) by Skidrow  and copied all the files from 10 dlc pack folder to my game installation folder.

Then i double clicked HKship.exe, the game got launched(finally :) ) and so far the game works perfectly without any problems. 

This method worked for me i hope it does for you too... "
[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-28T23:43Z,Crack fix is already included in this.
,rxanp,2012-08-29T09:12Z,"Did Everything I'm supposed to: Deactivated antivirus, blocked with firewall... The HKship.exe launches a white window which crashes in a few seconds... Mr.Stifmeister please help, Blackbox repacks have always been good to me in the past..."
,The012Freak,2012-08-29T16:19Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister 
I know that crack fix is included in BB repack, but for some even though crack fix is included game is not launching, So i tried 10 dlc pack(it also includes crack fix) after downloading and copying the game worked for me."
,SlimJim420,2012-08-30T05:58Z,"This one actually worked for me, all the others didnt, although i spent more time trying to fix this than other so that might be it as well, but just install, and deny internet acess to HKship.exe or w.e it is, and allow buddha.dll as an exception in your firewall."
,smartyhem,2012-08-31T03:21Z,"after installing the game does not started nothing happens on clicking the sleeping dogs shortcut then i used this  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7565370/Sleeping_Dogs_-_SKIDROW_(crack_fix#filelistContainer

just copy all the contents in the installed directory dont forgot to copy .pandora too and the game worked like a charm for me any way thanks mr.stifmeister and black box :)"
