Why do otherwise brilliant and successful leaders fail ΓÇô and often do so dramatically? How can you prevent your own career ΓÇ£train wreckΓÇ¥ by learning from their experiences? This book distills the core causes of executive failure, demonstrates how to identify them in your own behavior ΓÇô and helps you to eliminate or avoid them. Bill Lane, Jack WelchΓÇÖs long-time colleague draws on his own experience as a GE insider as well as from extensive interviews with former GE executives now running their own companies, including Dave Calhoun (CEO, Nielsen); Jim McNerney (CEO, Boeing); Lloyd Trotter (retired Vice-Chairman of GE), Frank Doyle (ex-Executive VP at GE), Kip Condron (ex-CEO, Americas, AXA Equitable); Andrew McMahon (President, AXA Equitable), and many others. Together with these elite executives, Lane demonstrates how to avoid arrogance, recognize when you must micromanage, learn how to communicate far more effectively, maintain a relentless focus on what matters most, and avoid the temptations to sacrifice your #1 leadership asset: your integrity. Along the way, he offers hard-hitting insights on everything from choosing your battles to cultivating the ΓÇ£rightΓÇ¥ forms of paranoia. Losing It will be an indispensable resource for everyone aspiring to become a more effective leader, including managers at all levels, and all MBA candidates and executive education students.
