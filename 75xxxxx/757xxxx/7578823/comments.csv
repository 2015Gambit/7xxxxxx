,Ogre717,2012-08-28T20:47Z,Does this work with a retail copy of ME3????
,Ogre717,2012-08-28T20:55Z,If so can someone give me a idea on how patch this. I know i need to make a file copy and patch that but yeah I need the file for that as well a link would really help.
,Darth_Revan0811,2012-08-28T20:56Z,does this come with 1.03 and if not where could I get it ? 
,Darth_Revan0811,2012-08-28T21:00Z,"okay found 1.03 here on the bay and I already had it installed anyway. 

Thanks for the fast upload man."

,Mimiux,2012-08-29T02:37Z,"Works like charm, thank you so much n_n
At least it did...there´s a weird glitch in a certain part of the game, where I can´t climb down a ladder and I can´t continue forward and finish the mission, the character is just shaking on the place, it´s weird, restart didn´t work. 
Does anyone here have the same issue?"
,Ogre717,2012-08-29T02:57Z,I haven't started this dlc tho I have it setup. My issue is with other dlc content I have from my retail copy not working. I don't have any of the armors weapons from ash's and probably the rest of it working so I have no clue if this will work either. Some help would be greatly thanked.
,jockstewart1992,2012-08-29T04:06Z,"@Mimius, that's not the DLC that's a common probably with the game (most notably on the Ardat Yakshi planet). Keep clicking the 'use' button on the ladder repeatedly until you slide/climb down it. 
Oh and props to the uploader!"
,jockstewart1992,2012-08-29T04:11Z,"@Ogre717,
Try this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7081986/Mass.Effect.3.DLC.Unlocker-RELOADED It should work for the majority of the ones you already have, as for Leviathan I'm not sure."
,Ogre717,2012-08-29T08:50Z,"@ jockstewart1992 Thanks man

@ Mimiux Yeah I'm having the same issue on the dlc even rapid tapping the use button with no affect. Then I get killed by harvesters."
,Fantomnz,2012-08-29T09:15Z,"Ok as usual Ill prob work this out myself & post a 1000% install working guide!
Iv got the DLC is there a certain mission to activate? 

(Gamers)"
,Unknown16,2012-08-29T13:32Z,"Fucking amazing DLC, kudos to Bioware for releasing something that should of been ingame. Got chills when talking to Leviathan anyway and the things he said, actually made the ending make sense (Which I thought was impossible). Thanks uploader by the way, quick download and thumbs up from me.

@Mimius - had the same glitch when reaching the Doctor. Just keep moving using WASD keys and keep pressing Space till you jump down, worked for me"
,Mimiux,2012-08-29T15:27Z,"Thank you all, I finally got it working. I almost broke my spacebar, but it´s ok now ;) The glitch keeps on happening (I tried it many times), but pressing W or spacebar repeatedly can fix it."
,zuxn,2012-08-29T17:15Z,"Did anyone had problems with getting a email from Hackett? I tried to reinstall 1.03 patch and DLC, but it didnt helped"
,Ogre717,2012-08-29T17:24Z,Ive tried a cycle of wasd and space with nothing
,Ogre717,2012-08-29T17:59Z,I think it is the dlc seeing on how I have never had this issue till i got a pirated crack so I can play this dlc.
,Bluemartian,2012-08-29T20:58Z,"I added the files to my directory. I can open the game but to when I go to load my file the loading screen is infinite and I have to manually end the process.

Same thing when starting a new game. The load screen just lasts forever. The image is moving, like one is a starship and one is a cup of coffee.
The image is moving but nothing is happening."
,Adam_21,2012-08-29T21:38Z,"this DLC breaks the sound for me.  Game goes completely silent. I ran installation repair through origin (after removing cracked files/executables), added everything but Leviathan back in, sound was working.  Added Leviathan?  Sound is gone.  Any idea how to fix this? I already tried configuration utility, making sure that sound is on. The last sound I hear when turning game on is the EA omniblade logo. Then nothing."
,Mimiux,2012-08-29T21:50Z,"@Bluemartian - Do you have the 1.03 patch and DLC unlocker? (unless you bought the game)?

@Ogre717 - Trust me, just try it again until the glitch fixes itself. Keep circling around, press spacebar repeatedly, try climbing down the ladder from various angles and it should work (after some time) I asked my friends who downloaded this torrent too if they encountered the same issue and it worked for them."
,Ogre717,2012-08-29T23:28Z,After some time.....Is about 2 hours good enough I can't sit here forever getting shot and getting killed by harvesters. It doesn't work. All ladders in this area are bugged I can't go back either. There needs to be a fix.
,Bluemartian,2012-08-29T23:29Z,"I added the 1.03 patch to specified directory, and I use the DLC unlocker to open the game."
,Ogre717,2012-08-30T02:20Z,Try putting this in http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7523214/Mass_Effect_3_DLC_Firefight__%5BFix%5D
,rawtoni,2012-08-30T04:02Z,This worked like a charm for me. Just copy the files in the right folders and you're good to go. 
,johnnii,2012-08-30T04:06Z,"There is a requirement for the dlc mission, apparently. You need to complete the Priority: Palaven Mission. Before Palaven, the only places you have access are the Hospital and Embassies. I downloaded the DLC and installed after I had just started my 2nd playthrough. I had just finished Mars mission and the dlc wasn't available. After completing Palaven, I got the e-mail from Hackett."
,Adam_21,2012-08-30T22:22Z,"Bandaid for getting stuck on the stair.  
If it is the last stair down before the elevator to rescue Ann, save right before it, open that save with gibbed editor, go to raw, player position.

input these coordinates:
x=8037.369
y=12831.5869
z=26533.2246

Abusing spacebar didn't work for me, so I calculated coordinates bellow the stair, through trial and error.  It was the only thing that worked for me.  Good luck!
P.S.  Fixed my sound issue by starting ME3 directly from binary/win32 folder. Not sure why desktop shortcut is not working properly."
,rawtoni,2012-08-31T01:09Z,"Played it, and it was meh. Not worth $10, not by a long shot. Pirate this all the way, people. "
,evan1991,2012-08-31T14:27Z,"@Adam_21 i tried save editor too and it works just fine 
thanks for the coordinates man 
they saved my life :P"
,Ogre717,2012-08-31T18:02Z,I finally got by. Not through w and space tho. I would make my way down the ladder and as I sat I hit alt + tab clicked the game and wham when I went into the game again I was at the bottom of the ladder.
,johnnii,2012-08-31T18:14Z,"I still didn't finish the dlc, but i believe the bugged part you guys are talking about is on the second planet you visit. When you rescue Ann Bryson and you have to head to the shuttle for evac. If yes, I didnt have trouble at all going down the stairs. And btw, you dont need to press space to go up/down the stairs. You only need to walk/run towards it."
,Sunderas1,2012-09-12T22:43Z,Works like a charm.
