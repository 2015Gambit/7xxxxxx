Notes: Missing Encores (Dream Song > Red Beans)

* I'm not sure why I see encores missing from
wsp shows here and there.  I think somewhere
down the line someone put it as filler on 
another disk due to disk capacity limitations,
but who knows?  Nonetheless, this show sounds
AWESOME in both quality and performance.  - Dooly
