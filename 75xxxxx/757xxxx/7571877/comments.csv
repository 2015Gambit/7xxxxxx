,TheHackPig,2012-08-27T04:21Z,"I have had problems with the DVD reader not liking certain disc brands. Everyone swears that TAIYO YUDEN brand is the best. Second best is the Verbatim brand, with the purple bottoms. 

If you can't get a disc to read that you burned, try a  different brand or buy one of the ones mentioned. This is why a lot of people get frustrated with the copied disc process. Also it is recommended to burn at the slower 4x speed. Not sure why, but they think it reduces the likely hood for errors. Doesn't make a lot of sense, but for what it's worth. Your mileage may vary.
