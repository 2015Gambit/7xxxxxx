This nifty program almost vanished; its homepage is gone, but I found a copy, and here it is for you to enjoy! It also includes an EPS to PNG converter. Simply install it, then drop a restricted PDF onto its icon to create a new PDF in the same location as the original with _no_PW added to the name. It will have restrictions such as prevent printing removed! You must be able to view the PDF in the first place, however. If you can't see anything at all, this may not work.
