,josesntgo,2012-08-26T20:43Z,"Activation Problem:

First, delete these two folders:

?:/AllUsers/Users/TreeCardGames/SolSuite
and
?:/ProgramData/TreeCard/Games/SolSuite

or, if you're using Windows XP:

?:/Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/TreeCardGames/SolSuite
and
?:/Documents and Settings/USER_NAME/Application Data/SolSuite

Then, go to the registry (regedit), and delete the following key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/TreeCardGames/Common/ABSol

After doing these two steps, I could finally activate SolSuite without it getting back to the Trial mode. Thanks to the original provider of this information!"
