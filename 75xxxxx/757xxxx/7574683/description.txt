Anahat is set in the 10th century B.C, in Shravasti, the capital of the Kingdom of Malla. It revolves around two individuals ΓÇö the king of Malla (Anant Nag) who is unable to father an heir, and the Queen, Sheelavati (Sonali Bendre), who is forced to choose a potent mate for one night. But, while the queen is ordered to merely produce an heir through the prevalent custom of Niyoga, she ends up enjoying the sexual act. Her overt demand for a repeat act thickens the plot.
