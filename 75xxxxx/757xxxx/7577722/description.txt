Promise, Texas, has lost all hope. Businesses are failing and the young people can't wait to grow up and move away. Just when things are at their darkest, a mysterious boy wanders out of the wilderness with nothing but the clothes on his back---and a very special message for the townspeople. But will they listen? Dove approved. 93 minutes. 

An unforgiving sun, a parched earth, and a failed economy have left a small Texas town desolate. For ten years Promise, Texas has known nothing but one curse after another. ItΓÇÖs barren, broken, and dying, leaving a town full of despair. When a couple finds a boy walking along a dusty road, alone in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but a mat tucked under his arm, they pick him up in hopes of helping him. What they donΓÇÖt realize is that he has come to help them and the residents of Promise.

No one knows who he is or where he came from. Some think heΓÇÖs an answer to prayer. Others think heΓÇÖs a runaway or a false prophet. And the only thing this boy will say about himself is that heΓÇÖs here to help. The townΓÇÖs sheriff, Brody, is determined to uncover the truth. But Brody has his own problemsΓÇªtrying to hold a dying town together.

Miracle after miracle takes place and the residents of Promise embrace the boy. But when the beloved town doctor dies, it is time for the truth to be revealed. The boy pleads with Brody in front of the whole town to believe that heΓÇÖs come to help, not to hurt anyone. Finally, with his back against the wall the boy reveals his true identity.
