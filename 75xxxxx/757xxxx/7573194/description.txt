Description: Two Teenage brothers, Howard & Guy Lawrence, are taking a more user-friendly and soulful approach to the breakbeat and "soulstep" genre, often drawing influences from similar musical acts such as James Blake, Mount Kimbie, and, to a certain extent, Burial. If you enjoy any of those acts, then you'll feel right at home with this EP. While it doesn't go over any new grounds, the EP should feel fresh and exciting to quite a few.
