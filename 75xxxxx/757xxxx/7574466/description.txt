Tizzie Hall has gained an international reputation as a baby whisperer and miracle worker. Even from an early age, Tizzie knew how to read babies body language and cries, and from that auspicious beginning she has developed a series of sleep routines that have provided parents and babies with a good night's sleep the world over.
 
Save Our Sleep is the book that parents asked Tizzie to write, and with over 100,000 copies sold in the past five years it has rapidly become the only book parents need to cure their own sleep deprivation! It provides specific routines for sleeping and feeding for all stages from newborns to two years, as well as addressing issues that can affect a baby's sleep pattern such as colic, reflux through to accommodating daylight saving, travelling and moving house.
 
New material includes new routines, integrated feedback on routines, dummy use, express feeding, dealing with premature babies and twins, more information on teaching your baby to self-settle and brand new case studies and tips.
 
Save Our Sleep is a must-have for all new parents. Practising Tizzie's routines is the solution to having a baby who will sleep through the night!
