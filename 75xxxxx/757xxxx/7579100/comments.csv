,phinazh,2012-09-07T15:59Z,thanks...where is the SRT sub?
,bangar91,2012-09-10T16:18Z,"For those who might be wondering, this is the real deal. The quality is awesome v9/10 and a10/10. The only minor problem is that the dark scenes have slightly more noticeable pixelation than i would like to have but still, they are very slight and not immediately noticeable to the eye (I am saying this when i have downloaded only 68% of the movie so could be something with the player itself). The commentary tracks are a very welcome addition. Kudos to the uploader for getting us the bluray rip even before the official availability. 

Anyone else beginning to download may wanna give a chance to the open matte version by the same uploader.

Personally I would download both of them as the open matte version has more of screen space and is not cut off to the academy ratio as this one.

@phinazh The subtitles (multiple) are embedded in the video file itself and can be optionally turned on by an appropriate setting in your player."
