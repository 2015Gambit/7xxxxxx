**NOTE FROM DOOLY-WZMB - I DESPISE POSTING INCOMPLETE SHOWS!!!

"Send Your Mind" was the first tune of Set 1.  "Hope In a Hopeless 
World" was the last tune of the show.  However, for some reason 
my source never included either of them!  Despite the show opener 
AND closer missing, this is a STELLAR show and superb sound quality.  

IF I can find those 2 missing tunes, I'll note the torrent and reseed 
it so you can download those 2 missing tunes. For WSP shows, it's VERY 
difficult these days to get SBD's unless WSP posts them for download 
on their site, which are not too many "classic" shows.  On occasion
someone will reseed torrents on etree if you're lucky.  

I'VE TRIED FOR A FEW WEEKS TO FIND 'HOPE' AND 'SEND' ONLINE WITHOUT
LUCK, BUT THIS ONE IS WORTH DOWNLOADING DESPITE THEM MISSING.
