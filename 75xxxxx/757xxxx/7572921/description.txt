feedbay is a php script which fetches torrent comments from the piratebay website and makes an atom feed of new comments.

you can specify many torrent ids in one run, the comments of these torrents will be written into one feed. comments newer than 2 days will be used.

you should take caution of torrents with a lot of comments as the script downloads all comments of a torrent. i could use paging (by using pages and page post variables) but the comments arent unique-numbered and there are removed comments (spam, etc) and i dont wanna watch huge torrents, so i didnt.
