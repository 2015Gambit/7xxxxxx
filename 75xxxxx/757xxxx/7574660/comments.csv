,shane3900,2012-08-30T08:21Z,little bit of a waste of time and download limit. will only play with vlc player and has hard coded english subs and they speak english anyway so why have sub titles. great effort tho. 10/10 quality.

Lol, your English is fantastic!, and the subs you probably can't read anyway, so just turn them off (if you know how ;-).
Besides vlc is the worst player possible for playing 1080p mkv-s. Try MPC and see the difference."
