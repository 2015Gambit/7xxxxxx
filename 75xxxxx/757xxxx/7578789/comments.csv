,barbenoire75,2012-09-05T10:18Z,"1 - Install ""splash_pro_ex_1_13_0_setup.exe"" and close the utility once the installation is complete.
2 - Shut off your Internet connection settings in Windows.
3 - In the settings of your firewall active (Windows or your anti-virus), prevent access to the internet to complete the application Splash Pro EX).
4 - Run the application ""Splash PRO EX"" normally from the desktop icon.
5 - In the application, enter a name for the license key and paste a file ""Serials.txt.""
6 - Turn your Internet connection settings in Windows.
7 - Restart the computer, if necessary.
8 - Enjoy!"
