,Dimmis80,2012-09-01T19:01Z,"Hey friend.Is there a change about this game to upload it in 480p-720p and in English.I mean i like 1080p more ofcorse even better but i am very cool with the 480p or 720p becuase of the very nice quality to but more smaller GB to download.And i don't know why the guys that download this just one care to seed,i don't know if is only u who seed it..so it would be kinda imposible to have it in some days or if i would very lucky and goes to my maximum with my speed or at least half of my speed..Btw for this game future Bundesliga-Bayern games and Barcelona-Real games of the season can u upload it in English to or the games to have the option to have more than one language to choose and ofcorse English and stuff.??My friend u might remember me for the NBA games that gave us for the previous Season and playoffs and i like your work and ofcorse your friends the Rippers great work to.So i am a folower at least here and a believer.And finaly btw if u read my previous message in one of your Torrents in the nba section here and u can't find a game like this or u can't have much time to upload it i totaly understand so if u read it and u just can't do it no problem but becuase u did not answer my back then about a game with Bulls 90s period Jordan-Pippen and stuff against Pistons with Grand Hill rookie back then and the others.I would love to just remember how Grand back then that was great did against the best player my opinion of all time Air Mike and stuff..Again no presure mate.Keep up the awesome work.Cheers."
