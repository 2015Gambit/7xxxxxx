[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-29T04:30Z,"You're welcome bkblatino. 

The reason why it bugs me is because if somebody searches for Fantagraphics, or clicks on Fantagraphics in the Tags section of one of my other uploads, this book won't show up. I know it's not a big deal. It's just a total facepalm moment to get something like that wrong after getting everything else about the upload right."
