NOTE:  Dick's Picks 34 was actually a combination of just 7 songs from this venue in Toronto, Ontario combined with their show on 11/5/77 across the National Border and shores to the East of the Great Lake of Ontario in Rochester, NY at the Community War Memorial. DP 34 was only a 3CD set that could have crowbarred in at least this show's Sunrise and Good Lovin' along with Ship of Fools, Scarlet > Fire, and Terrapin Station on a fourth disc.

I apologize for the single track for Scarlet>Fire and a couple of the others.  That's how I received it and I didn't want to alter it.
