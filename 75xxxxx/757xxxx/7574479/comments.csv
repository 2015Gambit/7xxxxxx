To me this kind of uploads are suspicious files I wouldn't even consider downloading."
,fullmetal1337,2012-08-27T19:25Z,"antignor if u dont want download this, why you come here? , maybe they not know how to download this program only for torrents or not know where they can download it. So..."
,pir8s007,2012-08-27T19:41Z,"@fullmetal1337

Its not a issue for me whether its open source or can download form developer's website. but I want you to advice something, please try to mention which version you are uploading and avoid to set password....  "
,fullmetal1337,2012-08-27T20:33Z,"pir8s007 sure man, no problem with that thx for the advice, i did that cuz i upload this for others 4 websites and I do not want others to steal my publications ,but i will do that for THP"
,fullmetal1337,2012-08-27T20:37Z,AND IS Notepad++ 6.1.5
,antignor,2012-08-27T22:35Z,"I came here because the name was misspelled and it made me curious. If you want to make people known with Notepad++ (it is a good program after all, I agree with you if that's your opinion as well) you could have said that in your description as well that it can be downloaded from the official website as well and create a torrent with only the link to the website in a text file. That people don't know they can download software from other places than torrent and that most developers have their own websites is ridiculous and those just downloading stuff like this from torrents are ignorant. Maybe that's what you're trying to exploit?

This is just a strange file with password, no matter what excuse you're trying to make up for it. I can say anything I like in any torrent. Try to stop me..."
,fullmetal1337,2012-08-27T23:07Z,"antignor kkk i wrong writing the name xD, but idc what u think about this torrent if is  suspicious files o whatever other i uploaded this cuz i wanted do it, if any people dont wanna download it well i cant do nothing.say all u want I will not stop you and I will not continue this conversation that leads nowhere"
