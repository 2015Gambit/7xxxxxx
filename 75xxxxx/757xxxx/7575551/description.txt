The depiction of Tim Hunter's life continued in a five-issue mini-series called The Names of Magic, in which Tim learnt his true name (Timothy Hunter; Tamar, son of Tamlin; the Opener; the Merlin; Magic) and was accepted into the school of magic, known simply as White School, which exists across the Multiverse of Worlds in DC.

This mini-series follows many other issues telling the tales of the life of Tim Hunter. It's posted here, seemingly at random, due to it's connection to Mister E (he appears in this mini-series). Should you wish to download the other Books of Magic comic books they are presently available within other, larger torrents (such as the Books of Magic, Neil Gaiman or Sandman torrents).
