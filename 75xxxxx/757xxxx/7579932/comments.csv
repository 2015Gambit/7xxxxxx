,Weston0175,2012-08-29T16:04Z,Ever hear of the christian rock band Hokus Pick? They're like the christian version of bare-naked ladies. They're music might be hard to find nowadays since they were only active in the 90's and early 00's.
,PooterP551,2012-08-29T23:57Z,"Great work again. I do have some request if you have them. 
Bishop Noel Jones: Welcome to the City.  
Jahaziel: Ready to Live. 
Vashawn Mitchell:Created4This
Anything from Charlie Peacock
Thanks again"

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-31T22:29Z,"Weston0175, yeah I've heard of Hokus Pick. Unfortunately I only have 2 of their 10 releases. And that hardly makes a discography.  :("
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-31T22:30Z,"PooterP551, you're asking for a lot of single albums there. I try to not torrent single albums, but rather discographies.  That said, let me work on a Charlie Peacock collection for you.  I must have close to a dozen of his releases."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-31T22:32Z,"PooterP551, one more thing. I put that ""Vashawn Mitchell - 2012 - Created4This - Deluxe Edition"" album in my 34th bundle for you today. So be sure to grab it when you get a chance."
