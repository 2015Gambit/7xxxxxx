Sex, lies and Wikileaks: Has the media lost the plot? 

This July marked two years since the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks released the Afghan War Logs. Since then, the path for its founder Julian Assange has not been a smooth one, and it has led to an extradition battle between the UK and Ecuador.

When the war logs first came out, major newspapers like the New York Times, Der Spiegel and The Guardian collaborated with Wikileaks, but two years on those relationships have changed. 

Once friendly media outlets are now reporting Assange's story - the allegations of sex crimes, his extradition and now his asylum - far more critically. But is this all fair comment or is Assange part of a media witch hunt?

In this week's News Divide we ask if the media have lost the plot on the Wikileaks story.  LP continues with items on Myanmar press freedom, a Japanese journalist who died in Syria, plus, an interview with one of Egypt's most influential voices, Yosri Fouda, and a video feature look at the Paralympics.
