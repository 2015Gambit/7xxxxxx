Long before the events of the movie Ôki, who was approaching middle age, had a relationship with 16-year-old Otoko. She got pregnant, but the child was stillborn. Their relationship ended then. Much later Ôki became a famous writer, and Otoko a famous painter. But she never overcame the trauma and instead became a lesbian. Her favourite student and beloved one is the beautiful Keiko. 24 years after their initial love affair Ôki goes to Kyoto to meet Otoko. Their meeting is polite with secret emotional shadows. Keiko devises a plan. She intends to seduce Ôki, become pregnant, bear Ôki’s child and give it to Otoko. She hopes that Otoko may thereby be rid of her trauma. But she also wants to take her revenge on the man who had harmed her beloved. Secretly she gets acquainted with Ôki’s son, invites him to Kyoto and seduces him. Then she calls his parents and tells them that he have promised to marry her. Horrified, they take the first plane to Kyoto. Meanwhile, she takes the son boating and arranges an accident.
