The community of physical and occupational therapists has responded to this text in an overwhelmingly positive way. Although many health care professionals from a
variety of backgrounds will find this an appropriate text for study and reference, whenever possible, the terminology and concepts of the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice (referred to as the Guide), developed by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), have been integrated into this third edition.
The Guide was developed as an expert consensus document by panels of clinicians and then reviewed by over 1000 therapists across the country. Three conceptual models are integrated throughout the Guide: the (Nagi)Disablement Model, the Integration of Prevention and Wellness Strategies, and the Patient/Client Management Model.
The Disablement Model extends the scope of the medical model of disease with its primary emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of disease by placing the focus on the functional consequences of disease. Both the medical model and the Disablement Model are reflected in this text. Diagnosis and treatment of disease in this text are presented following the medical model along with the Disablement Model's assessment of the impact of acute and chronic conditions on the functioning of specific body systems (impairments) and basic human performance (functional limitations).
Thus the reader will see terminology reflective of these two models, such as "etiology," "pathogenesis," "diagnosis," and "prognosis" from the traditional medical model  and "impairments," "interventions," "desired outcomes," and "functional limitations" from the Disablement Model.
