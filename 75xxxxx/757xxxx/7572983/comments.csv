You show how it is to be a muslim: always on the defensive.

The description is not from the uploader but literally quoted from the Amazon page and you starts 'accusing' the uploader without any knowledge as if being an atheist mean being a criminal. Look around and you'll see the most atheist and secular countries have the lowest crime rates, so morals have nothing to do with religion. And what are good and bad morals is most of the time subjective anyway. Btw, I'm an atheist and I don't drink alcohol either and nobody ever told me to fornicate, I do it because I want to. And I've read the quran.

And everybody could have uploaded this. You just don't want to know what others think of your religion, because you might start to have doubts when you read solid reasoning and then you'll have the most severe punishment in the 'afterlife'.

I'd say, read the book and think of it what you think, but don't be a bigot and inform yourself."

This movie does not mean anything to Islam at all, or even for Muslims,
At least we do not make movies like this from you,
No thanks to lift a film like this"

1- Learn proper English . If you want to make a point, the least you can do is to write a decent sentence. Punctuation is as important as correct spelling and correct grammar. ( BTW, This is even worse when you remember the fact that current web browsers have "" spell check "" built in )
2- You're saying that your a Muslim, yet you used words like "" Fuckin "" , "" Ass-hole "", and "" shit "" in an offensive non-scientific context . That doesn't sound very religious to me.

I'm a Muslim, but before that I'm a HUMAN. Look it up in a dictionary.

@antignor : +1

@hassangfx: It is a BOOK !
and for heaven's sake Learn some ENGLISH !!"

I'm talking about western European countries where 'God' doesn't really play a roll in the lives of most people and their politics. But Buddhist countries do fit that category as well. You only need to compare some demographic maps on religion and crime and you'll see. And to make myself clear, I don't mean that religion is the cause of crime, I say that the causes of crime are other than religion.

@hassangfx
It's already been said, but this is not a movie, it's a book.
It doesn't matter what movies you make (there are very inflaming movies made by some Muslims as well). How non-Muslims are treated in most Muslim countries shows how the quran is interpreted. Many Muslims don't need any film or any other book than the quran to treat non-Muslims are some lesser kind of humans. Churches are being burnt all over the world in Muslim countries and non-Muslims are threatened until they leave their homes and even their countries. Even the various branches within Islam tend to fight each other by violent means.

What many Muslims still don't seem to understand is that freedom means that people may criticize each others ideas and beliefs and that when you're being criticized you don't just say ""shut up"", but come with reasonable arguments why what your opponent says is not true. But then at first you shouldn't shut your mind to the arguments by not reading the book criticizing your beliefs. I haven't read this book yet, the writer may be full of sh1t, maybe even from my atheist point of view, but to know that I must first read the book and so do you. Don't just criticize a title without knowing the argument used to come to that conclusion."
