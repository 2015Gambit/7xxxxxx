to Cybergodsig,  we can't seed this, only you can.  It is your upload.   Until you have seeded it 100%, or even more, all we can do is leech.   Stop and think the situation though.   

Also, please refrain from referring to us as ""bastards"".   You could cause hurt feelings. "
,tverlaine,2012-08-27T02:26Z,Do you think you are suppose to upload for a few minutes then we're suppose to take over to finish it?
,flacdude,2012-08-28T04:25Z,"Excuse me Sir but you have to stay online and seed until you see the number of seeder equal or exceed the number of leechers. That way every one of us ""critical bastards"" will be happy and, who knows, might even consider thanking you."
,cybergodsig,2012-08-29T21:25Z,get the other guys version its the same as mine
,cybergodsig,2012-09-01T03:57Z,not seeding this anymore
,hal4000,2012-09-03T14:34Z,Wow. Seems like you've learnt something in the end.
