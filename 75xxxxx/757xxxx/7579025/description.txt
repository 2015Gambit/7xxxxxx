I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ.
Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in ΓÇ£The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.ΓÇ¥ As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survivedΓÇôand famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers whoΓÇÖve long forgotten her.
The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for detailsΓÇôproof they hope may free BenΓÇôLibby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, sheΓÇÖll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club . . . and maybe sheΓÇÖll admit her testimony wasnΓÇÖt so solid after all.
