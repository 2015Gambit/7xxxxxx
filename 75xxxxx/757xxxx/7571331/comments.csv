,xCirrex,2012-09-05T22:15Z,How the fuck are a normal person supposed to understand how to convert this file to an iso file!?!? Its fraking rocket sience in my eyes! !? HELP! GUIDE!?! DERP!?
,xCirrex,2012-09-05T22:17Z,"Oh wait.... i think it might have worked now... BUT STILL, just upload a freaking iso file next time. Please."
,xCirrex,2012-09-05T22:24Z,"Nope, it didn't. I might be retarded, but so is this torrent."
,dt7ll5op,2012-09-05T22:41Z,"i didnt upload an .iso because:
1) thousands of other people ALREADY did that before me so that would be useless (torrents works best if many people are downloading them - if you upload more torrents of the same content, less people will download each separate torrent, leechers split, less seeders, torrents become slower. so never upload a torrent which is already on the internet.)

2) as i wrote in the description, wia files are smaller enough to be WORTH storing your wii collection in that format.
smaller size means smaller downloads

3) i myself keep my collection in that format, so this is what i CAN share. if i would use iso, my collection would need 585 GB space which is 380 GB more than it is currently.

for help with .wia (assuming youre using windows) please refer to http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571586/"
