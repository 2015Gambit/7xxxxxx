Notes from MOTB: This is one of those OMG recordings... we wish this was the quality all of our releases.


Notes from Jim Goldman: In 1990 or so my uncle was going to throw out a big box of reel to reel tapes and since he still had the machine he bought to play them on I wanted to go through the box. Most of the reels 
were WLS top 40 for 6 years in a row not missing a week. I found a diferent type of tape (Ampex) and it said GD Huntington and that was it. I of course wanted to transfer it as best could and there were no real 24/48 
recorders out there except for computer recording. The computer room was on the complete other side of the home so we did a transfer in real time on a Phillips "super CD" recorder which meant 24/48. What may have happened 
is we ran out of room on a CD and had to stop the recorder very quickly to change CDs and that may also make the missing verse question answered. I started again at the wrong place.this was a huge challenge and I think 
we did OK.
