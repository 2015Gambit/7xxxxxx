yes,you can ,but is hard to find servers with ""NO CD-Key"" "
,Deathbyname,2012-08-28T22:51Z,Seed Please!
,RMJ113,2012-08-29T08:59Z,"FYI , DAYZ, uses a sepreate .exe to play , it realy has nothing todo with the LEGIT game , so yes DAYZ should work with this , I suggest using ""TUNNGLE"" Google it . and play DAYZ lan there more then 10 lobbys with over 1,000 DAYZ players.

DAyz is Server dependant! so you have to play on a  DAYZ , server ! 

Dayz is not made for single player!"

,Cartonofmilk,2012-08-29T21:41Z,"Ok is this the Jimbo version? I need to know this before i dl because the copy that's been around most recently, i can't install. It'll go through  the whole extraction process but won't actually ever extract the exes. I REALLY Want to try dayz but haven't been able to so far. I hope this one is different."
,radurall,2012-08-30T17:43Z,"easy to install ,and containing latest updates .and no ,is not Jimbus version"
,RMJ113,2012-08-31T15:39Z,"FYI , the expansions will not work with the Regfix! The regfix will only allow arma 2 and AO to work!"
