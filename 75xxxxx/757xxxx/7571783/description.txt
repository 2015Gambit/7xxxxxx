Bio

Led by producer/vocalist/songwriter Jazzie B., Soul II Soul were one of the most innovative 
dance/R&B outfits of the late '80s, creating a seductive, deep R&B that borrowed from Philly 
soul, disco, reggae, and '80s hip-hop. Originally featuring Jazzie B., producer/arranger 
Nellee Hooper, and instrumentalist Philip "Daddae" Harvey, the musical collective came together 
in the late '80s. The group had a residency at the Africa Centre in London's Covent Garden, 
which led to a record contract with 10, a subsidiary of Virgin. Two singles, "Fairplay" and 
"Feel Free," began to attract attention both in clubs and in the press
