Hi,
I'm so tired of all the costs that you need to bare with when having the dream of becoming a pilot. I hope that this reduces the costs for you. This is the Nordian ATPL (all books) version 6.


The CD is valid until august 2013, after this it is possible to extend it by paying some more cash to the capitalistic bastards. 

Also, if anyone is really good at computers, can  you please tell me how I can print some of the pages of the e books? The books are in the form of applications and when I start the program it is even impossible to make a printscreen and then print it.

This is my first torrent so please give me advice if it does not work.

Keep on flying and don't let the dream fly away from you, unfortunately I did that some years ago and now I'm trying to be a pilot.

Piiis out bitchez!
