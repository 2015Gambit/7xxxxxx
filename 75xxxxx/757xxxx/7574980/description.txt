Review

"This is a succinct, easy-to-follow and well-illustrated guide to the orthopaedic medicine approach to diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal disorders. "Physiotherapy, October 1993 found the book very informative with clear and good illustrations throughout. The authors went to great length in demonstrating and emphasizing the importance of history taking clinical examinations. It is a good book since it contains excellent text and illustrations."Saudi Medical Journal, July 1983 is a very handsome book that clearly illustrates careful and accurate soft tissue examination and treatment. It would be a welcome addition to the library of a pirmary care physician and also of great use to sports physicians and to physicians providing acute care to injured patients." Susan Vanderberg-Dent, MD,, Doody's Health Sciences Book Review Annual, December 1993 book will be a precious help for all physicians who come into contact with non-surgical lesions of the locomotor system, mainfested by pain. It will serve doctors from a broad spectrum of specialities, orthopaedics in their outpatient clinics, neurologists, physiotherapists, doctors dealing with industrial and sports medicine and also all... general practitioners."
