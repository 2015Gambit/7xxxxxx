,rmm1245,2012-08-27T23:12Z,I just find it funny that this post is sandwiched between a post of jap porn and a post of heavy metal.
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-28T00:49Z,You might find it just as funny that there is also some heavy christian metal included within this torrent.  No japanese porn though.

,Weston0175,2012-08-28T22:53Z,"Hi-ho Torrent Tracts! Do you happen to have any music by the band First Call? They were a christian group from the 70's and 80's. If you don't that's fine, I don't want to bug you."
,Weston0175,2012-08-28T23:23Z,Or Gary Chapman?
,ucresultz,2012-08-29T23:57Z,Hey TT...do you have Maurette Brown Clark's discography? Or Amber Bullock's Thank you cd? 
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-31T22:25Z,"Ucresultz, I only have a few Maurette Brown Clark albums.  But come to think of it, I think she's released less than 5 in total.  Let me work on that, and an Amber Bullock collection for you soon."
