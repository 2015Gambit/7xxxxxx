2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Ever nearing that goal of sharing 1000 titles for you to sample by the end of 2012, we're now up to 864 releases on the year.

There are 25 more titles jam packed into this 33rd bundle today.  Some of my personal favorites include TobMac's brand new "Eye On It" release, the always soulful and gospel sound of Troy Sneed, Impact Nation Choir's "The In Times" upbeat gospel album, singer and songwriter Bill Fay's "Life Is People", and rapper and hip-hop artist Mr John Duncan's new "Closure EP."

As always, please seed for as long as you're able to.  Support those artists you truly enjoy.  And always give the glory back to God where it rightfully belongs!
