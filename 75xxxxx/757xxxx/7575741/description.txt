

After many a sleepless night we've finally managed to put together a composite print of Lady Frankenstein. 

We redubbed the German widescreen broadcast print to English and then added the missing scenes from the Swedish VHS. 

The end result runs at aprox 95mins PAL/99 mins NTSC which is the longest print we've seen. Please note the inserted scenes are of much poorer quality but will not spoil your viewing of this eurocult classic.

Most of the audio and the missing scenes have been taken from the old Swedish VHS, a small part remains in German and has been subtitled in English. 

The German print had quite a few differences and some scenes were longer than the VHS version, also a few scenes were notably missing. 

Whether this is complete i'll leave to the experts but judging from and comparing all released versions this is now intact. 

A few frames here and there were shorn to help the video flow better. Anyway i hope someone out there enjoys it, after so many repeated viewings over the last month i've really come to love this film.
