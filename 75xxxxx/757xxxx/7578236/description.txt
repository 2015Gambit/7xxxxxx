There are dark bloodthirsty monsters hidden among us. They stalk humanity at will, stripping off the weak and those foolish enough to stray into their path. One vampire has broken free and seeks to save that last bit of humanity he has left by taking down the master of all the vampires and his own creator. It all transpires in a small town in Massachusetts and a group of the towns citizens are caught in the crossfire.
