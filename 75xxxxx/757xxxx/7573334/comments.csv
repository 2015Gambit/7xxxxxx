[T],trialNerror,2012-08-27T08:17Z,"thanks sceneline and dhd!

hah. that guy there. the ever-ungrateful-never-good-enough for psspss... lol always something to complain about and won't ever give a ""thank you"".

he spent an hour looking around for season info on this series...? wow, super slow typing or easily distracted, i hope.  i found out all the info in 15 minutes.

yes, his link, wiki, and tvguide will say it's specials or it's own spin-off. however, i already explained scene seems to use the ""majority rules"" rule and all these popular places list it as season 4...

5 over 3. s04 wins. quit your whining and be thankful you're getting this episode - free - without commercials - in HD.  oh yea, since it does have a network logo on it psspss says that's defacing the video.  could one be any bigger of a twat? jesus, man...

annoying. "
,xpmule,2012-08-27T08:54Z,"holding out for a lower res x264 scene rip. Which will ofcourse come from DHD's source so yeah big thanks to DHD :)
I can't express enough how grateful i am for the effort you and other groups
go to cap, encode and release etc

Sceneline sometimes forgets to seed a torrent but whatever ..still a solid uploader !

@psspss
i kinda agree with buddy i have noticed you posting that a LOT over and over.
i'm not bothered by it though lol

@trialNerror
i'm gonna take the opportunity to bow down to you sir !
In my random searchs for videos i always end up seeing some of your rips that fill in the gaps nicely.
Thanks big time !

According to TPB staff its none of our business what people upload and watch out or your comments could viewed as an attack LOL
See the topic in the forum if you wanna know why i said that ;)"
[V],psspss,2012-08-27T13:13Z,"Seems people dont listen is the reason I posted it again.,. too many egos at TPB

tne your being silly again

I spent a hour not just figuring out the confusion
on the naming
but also if I could find the missing episodes as streams as it aired back in nov 11 in canada

I wasnt the only one confused if this was really a new season or just a relabelled ver however USA did.. rename seems discovery change the name of the title for mexican island

most of us were hoping it was either the 10 days repeated again so get ot see the missing part 2s or perhaps more episodes made but alas no more then 4 :*(

plus if people know this is 10 days special and not a new season they could watch ep3 as its already up on TPB"
[V],psspss,2012-08-27T13:24Z,"Get the full details what les is doing on his website here.. you notice he even calls them specials not new season
http://lesstroud.ca/news/survivorman-returns

however not sure by the heading if hes filming more 10 day specials .. which would be good if he was.. must be a good money maker for him.. run low of cash,.. go out make another special :)"
,Napalmm,2012-08-28T10:12Z,"Thanks a lot, sceneline.

Also, I don't see what's the fuss about the name, it comes up as long as you search for survivorman, and anyone with half a brain can figure out what it is regardless of the name, wether it says ""10 days"" or ""season 4"". "
