,clear009,2012-08-26T10:14Z," I plan on uploading blitzkrieg antholgy as well later. If you like this, I have 2 dvd's (8 gigs) more of files for all the games that use the blitzkrieg engine..   Also for those who don't know you can click my name at the top of this page ""clear009"" for my uploads.........."
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:21Z,Also I may need to turn my computer off for awhile for a lil maintenance. But keep your torrent program on cause I will continue seeding until there are at least 7-8 other people seeding it.....
,clear009,2012-08-26T10:29Z,One more thing.. I mainly play WW2 games..100's... You name it I probably have it. So if you cant find one let me know and I will post it if I have it.
,7cjbill2,2012-09-02T08:09Z,Can someone pls seed?  I've been stuck on 77.63% for days!  I'll seed for a wk at full b/w in ret.  Thx.
,clear009,2012-09-06T00:30Z,Going to seed all my torrents for awhile since some people are getting it and not seeding and helping others who want it.. Plus I will post some more files for the blitzkrieg series.. If anyone is interested in any other WW2 games let me know I may have it. 
,clear009,2012-09-06T08:27Z,"This is about all the blitzkrieg 1 stuff I have, I have all the games that use blitzkrieg 2 as well. Also alot of people that like blitzkrieg also like the sudden strike series. I have all those as well including hidden stroke. I also the last sudden strike 3 patch released that work correctly. If you go to any website and download the final sudden strike 3 patch its screwed and makes all units in game not able to be destroyed. Took me 2 years to find 1 that works right."
