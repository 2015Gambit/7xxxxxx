If you like the conservative, positive, American values of this content, consider reading (and buying) his other books, including Right Turns and the 10 Big Lies About America. I am not affiliated with Michael Medved, just want to share some of these critical, valuable, and intelligent ideals with others."

However, the haters are likely to have some nasty things to say.  But who cares, so longs as the US can make a course correction and start growing the economy I say, let 'em scream."

""Conservative values"" = bigotry, racism, xenophobia, elitism, sexism.

Declaration of Independence (1776): ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal""

Animal Farm (Orwell, 1945): ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others"".

Which one sounds to you more like today's ""conservative values""?  We're all equal, but the more equal ones really need an additional tax cut, don't they?  And the less equal ones don't really need help with education and health care because they're too stupid to learn and they'd be better off dead.  Or going back where they came from.

,mantikor777,2012-08-27T07:34Z,"Yep, LemonJ-Lo, you are one of the ignorant haters.   Created equal does not mean everything should be equal.  Those who try harder and work harder should enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Your quote from Orwell is describing the ultimate liberal utopia of a totalitarian communist state.  Your ignorance does not allow you to understand that IT JUST DOESN'T WORK in real life.  Great fantasy, however."
