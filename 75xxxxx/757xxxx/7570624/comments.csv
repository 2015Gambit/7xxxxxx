Any idea why this version here won't load up? It starts up for a brief second and then just shuts down. Looks like the screen resolution on this one you have here is set for a small device..  

I really wanted this one...   :)"

Yes this version is for android phones only.Tablet version isnt released yet.But you can try with chainfire 3d with plugins and options for textures.Maybe it will help with the problem"

Thanks for the info on the chainfire 3d. Never heard of this app until today. I did download it and test it out but it doesn't seem to make much difference...."
