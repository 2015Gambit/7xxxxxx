Learn to Speak German--the Dirty Deutsch Way!

If you think German is all brat and no wurst, you need to think again. German is sexier--and dirtier--than you might imagine. (Think Hamburg!) From hearts and violins to pigs and dogs, Goethe's native tongue is ripe--and rank--with creative obscenities, including:

Kuck mal diese geile Schnitte!
Look at that sexy chick!
Literal translation: Look at that sexy slice!

Alle wissen dass Klaus sehr gut geigt.
Everyone knows Klaus f**ks well.
Literal translation: Everyone knows Klaus plays the violin well.
