Juanjo Mena conductor

Juanjo Mena presents a major world premiere before offering his acclaimed reading of a sonorous yet dangerously eruptive Bruckner symphony.

First though, there's the emblematic love of Tristan and Isolde, expressed through music dark in sound and revolutionary in harmony. James MacMillan's works have enjoyed regular success at the Proms since the first performance of The Confession of Isobel Gowdie was given here in 1990.

As with Bruckner, MacMillan's communicative power is often associated with expressions of faith, and the unveiling of Credo, has been keenly awaited.
