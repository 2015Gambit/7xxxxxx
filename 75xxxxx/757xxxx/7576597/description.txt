This video was captured in the downtown area of Lake City, SC, which is the "center of a thriving agricultural area, but has added a number of other diversified industries as well." (From the Lake City website.) The South Carolina Tobacco Festival will be taking place in Lake City again this year, from September 13-15th, and will be home to many fun events. Please consider visiting the Festival so you can get a taste of our unique cultural heritage! Check out the Lake City website for all the info -
