Boot CD does not contain the installer program, is created by the program."

,JRaiden,2012-08-31T01:35Z,"Thank you so much, nikita200. I was actually installing the 2013 trial (220 MB+) just to make this image and uninstall. Thanks again nikita, and seeders. Will seed aplenty when new image is up and running on new SSD. :)"
,Joe.Tauch,2012-08-31T10:00Z,"If you need Acronis True Image for drive backuping, restoring and cloning purposes, this torrent is right just for you. Simply download this .iso, burn it to CD/DVD and boot it at system startup. You’ll be able to create/validate/restore backups and clone drives fast and easy without the need to install, crack and activate regular Acronis True Image.  I’ve tried Acronis True Image Home (ATIH) 2012 and had some problems activating and using the program. By the way, regular ATIH install creates various virtual devices and .exes which run on system startup and some users might dislike this fact. Therefore, before installing ATIH, I suggest trying this Acronis rescue boot cd."
