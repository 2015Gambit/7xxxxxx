 Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting,
 filtering and encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI,
 DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs.
 Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting.

 - Free software :)
 - Released on Aug 8th 2012
 - Final non beta official build by "Gruntster"
 - This torrent contains the binaries for Windows x64
   So it does NOT have an installer. So if you want other versions
   with or with out the installer please see the official site.

If there are issues with this version consider using the experimental versions found at the same download locations. Personally i think they suck right now. Most of the XVID encoder options are missing :(

I like Avidemux but it has a lot of bugs / issues
I advise people to double check their conversions etc
But its free so i can't complain right ?

Changes: 
http://www.avidemux.org/smf/index.php?topic=10881.0
Same 2.5.6 codebase but all dependencies have been updated (libx264, etc).  An issue where the 32-bit version would crash for some users on start up has also been resolved.  ZoneAlarm is most likely still an issue though.

So that means for example the x264 encoder was updated

I think posting stuff like this is dumb but i almost missed this update !
So posting it will hopefully get the word out to my fellow Avidemux users.
They don't put out non beta updates too often so this is rare.
