[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-08-27T17:19Z,"It's really quite emotional, this last episode. I have been lucky enough to be in China three times, and also, briefly, to meet Ken Hom some years ago. I really recommend the book of this series, Amazon is selling it for half the ÂŁ25 cover price. Final observation: when can I marry Ching? I'm so glad all you people out there appreciated these uploads. The BBC comes out with some real gems, eh?"
[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-08-27T17:36Z,"Welcome, guys, so glad it is so much appreciated."

[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-08-28T20:50Z,"Mark111757, I'm afraid I don't have access to the new Hairy Bikers series, I'd love to see it myself but I don't have satellite TV, sadly it's not a BBC show. I'll keep an eye open for feeds, though."
