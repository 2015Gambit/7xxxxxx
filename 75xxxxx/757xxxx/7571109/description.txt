 New Hampshire is home to a variety of time-honored music and dance traditions. This 1999 studio recording is a collection of dance tunes played by six New Hampshire groups. Built upon a blend of English, French, and Celtic influences, the music features fiddle, guitar, flute, piano, mandolin, and hammered dulcimer. Some of New Hampshire's renowned dance callers invite you to "choose your partners" and join in New England contra dancing, barn dancing, and singing squares. Produced in collaboration with the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts.
