What up Pirate fam? I had to take this torrent down because I found 3 songs that I had to add to this collection. This is a serious collection spanning from 8 Mile, Mobb Deep, G-Unit and 50ΓÇÖs own commercial LPΓÇÖs. This is my first torrent ever done and I hope to do more as I am noticing some sick collections that I know people would love missing from the Piratebay collections. Please comment and I also added a custom album cover for you iTunes buffs!
