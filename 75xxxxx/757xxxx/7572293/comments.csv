CYBERGODSIG  --  you have to seed a file until people have the entire thing.    Asking other people to seed things they don't have doesn't do any good.    Read up on torrents.   Are you a troll, or mental defective?     Other people who may have the files from the places you got them can't help you seed, because you have changed the files,  obscuring the sources and other relevant information.  

Your uploads are worthless to the community. "
,flacdude,2012-08-27T01:08Z,Thanks to jkp159 for trying to straighten out the situation. I suspect that CYBERGODSIG is an RIAA agent.
,canadianice,2012-08-27T02:36Z,I suspect he is a MORON.
[T],rjordan21,2012-08-28T01:47Z,"I've got some great VH vinyl seeded in my torrents if anyone needs or wants.  I haven't searched here for more but I've got the Steve Hoffman remaster of I and other good vinyl rips.  If you can't find let me know and I'll upload.

Cudus to cybergodsig for his taste (if they're in fact real) but he either doesn't get how to seed a torrent or can't given his bandwirh/location/etc...."
,cybergodsig,2012-09-01T07:08Z,"download the new one, this one doesn't seem to be working."
