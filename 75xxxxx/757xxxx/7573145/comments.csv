i am Muslim n live next door to afghanistan and i have seen the devastation that Neurotic idiot caused in our country along with the loss of our prestige as a peace loving country.

during the afghan war against USSR, USA n its Allies (read poodles) like UK damned this region just to satisfy their stupid ego n thirst for human blood, gathered the worst murders of all the world in this region and armed them with a militant ideology and  (University of Nebraska prepared books for children of class 1 to 5 in which simple calculation was taught like this: 
""if there are 7 infidels and you behead three of them, how many infidels would remain?"" and; ""If Five muslims can send 10 infidels  to hell by killing them in 1 day, how many muslims it would take to send 120 infidels to hell in 3 days"")...

People like Laden are not freedom fighter because they claim to fight to Palestinians and arab land but are too afraid to go their and fight. they have found the unfortunate countries and people of afghanistan and pakistan to wage their idiotic and infidel jihad. 

he and his kind would have been  freedom fighters were their fight in middle east and have they sparesd afghanistan n pakistan."

Goldberg's point largely is that, while some Liberals Ideas may be quite good, the way they ARRIVE at these ideas is often very broken. I just finished it, and there is a lot of truth in it. However, I think he overreaches a bit."
