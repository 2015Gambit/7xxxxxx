Book Description

Use CoffeeScript to Write Better JavaScript Code Than Ever Before!

If you can do it in JavaScript, you can do it better in CoffeeScript. And, since CoffeeScript ΓÇ£compiles downΓÇ¥ to JavaScript, your code will fit neatly into virtually any web environment. In Programming in CoffeeScript, Mark Bates shows web developers why CoffeeScript is so useful and how it avoids the problems that often make JavaScript code buggy and unmanageable. He guides you through every feature and technique you need to write quality CoffeeScript code and shows how to take advantage of CoffeeScriptΓÇÖs increasingly robust toolset.

Bates begins with the absolute basics of running and compiling CoffeeScript and then introduces syntax, control structures, functions, collections, and classes. Through same page code comparisons, youΓÇÖll discover exactly how CoffeeScript improves on JavaScript. Next, youΓÇÖll put it to work in building applications that are powerful, flexible, maintainable, concise, reliable, and secure. Bates shares valuable tips for better development, illuminating CoffeeScriptΓÇÖs hidden gems and warning you about its remaining ΓÇ£rough edges.ΓÇ¥ The book concludes with a start-to-finish application case study showing how to code back-ends and front-ends and integrate powerful frameworks and libraries. Coverage includes
