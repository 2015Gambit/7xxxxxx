Summary: High school music teacher Beth Landon (Julie Mond) puts herself on the line when she invites world-famous country singer Jason Keith (Trevor Donovan) to perform at her rural townΓÇÖs Strawberry Festival. A one-hit wonder with a horrible rep for cancelling shows and copping an attitude, Jason isnΓÇÖt what BethΓÇÖs mother, Eileen (Shelley Long), considers a reliable musical act for the beloved festival, which she is proudly hosting with her good friend Ruth (Cindy Williams).  

 Beth, reigning as Strawberry Queen, attempts to stick up for her favorite singer, until she finally meets Jason face-to-face and itΓÇÖs obvious it wonΓÇÖt be easy. But behind JasonΓÇÖs rock star image, heΓÇÖs hiding a secret about his past that could turn around his tanking career.  Along with his manager Ray, Beth convinces Jason that the festival gig is a  great way to revitalize his career and win back his audience appeal. As Jason spends more time with Beth, his attitude starts to fade as they each encourage the other to realize their deepest dreams as talented musicians.
