CalcTape is a revolutionary new kind of pocket calculator. With CalcTape, also extensive calculations remain clearly structured. CalcTape makes the arithmetic process visible - you can generate intermediate results and subsequently correct or change all numbers and operations. 

Features

Enter many calculation terms in one turn and still keep an overview - like on an adding machine.
Use intermediate results to check and structure your calculation.
Comment your calculation terms, to give sense and context to it.
Enter "normal" text for extended comment on your calculation.
Change any term afterwards and CalcTape will refresh the whole calculation automatically.
Save your calculations into files. Open the files later and you can change the calculations. CalcTape will refresh the whole calculation automatically again and again.
Use your existing CalcTape files as templates. Only adjust some of your calculation terms and the new result is displayed immediately.
