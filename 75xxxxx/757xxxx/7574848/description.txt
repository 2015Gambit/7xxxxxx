Sinbad finds himself at sea having fled his home - and had a curse put on him by his grandmother - in his hometown of Basra. Of course, it's not plain sailing and his ship, Providence, soon stumbles across a storm which forces the unlikely band of travellers together. The 13-part series promises "a 21st century take on the classic 8th century iconic hero" for Sky1. Newcomer Elliot Knight plays Sinbad while his nemesis Lord Akbari is played by Lost's Naveen Andrews.
