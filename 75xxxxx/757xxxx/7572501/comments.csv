but can you plz plz upload in English plz! "
[V],Nepotu,2012-08-28T02:19Z,"You're welcome! I don't have the highlights. And I think that La Liga has more passion in spanish (like NBA in american english, Serie A in italian, Premier League in english, Bundesliga in german, Ligue 1 en french). I don't like the english commentators for La Liga. For me, the first option for FCB games will be in spanish, english second. Sorry!"
