,motley666,2012-08-27T20:01Z,"I had uploaded here a torrent, txt file only, that takes you to a site with all BK goodies, maps, mods and everything, even the total challenge was there! That torrent still floats around and is seeded but there is not here anymore because tpb didn't want txt files. I will post the link in case you need something from there. "

,motley666,2012-08-28T02:35Z,"The page will close in a few days, shit, i just noticed."
,clear009,2012-08-30T18:43Z,Yes motley666 Thats where I got alot of these files.. But some are ones I own.
,clear009,2012-09-06T00:26Z,Going to seed all my torrents for awhile since some people are getting it and not seeding and helping others who want it.. 
,clear009,2012-09-06T00:30Z,Plus I will post some more files for the blitzkrieg series.. If anyone is interested in any other WW2 games let me know I may have it. 
,clear009,2012-09-06T08:28Z,"This is about all the blitzkrieg 1 stuff I have, I have all the games that use blitzkrieg 2 as well. Also alot of people that like blitzkrieg also like the sudden strike series. I have all those as well including hidden stroke. I also the last sudden strike 3 patch released that work correctly. If you go to any website and download the final sudden strike 3 patch its screwed and makes all units in game not able to be destroyed. Took me 2 years to find 1 that works right."
