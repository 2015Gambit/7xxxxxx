This is for the Studio version of c4d...
There is one for the broadcast version but i suggest its the best you upgrade your c4d to Studio version anyway.
You can find serials for it here at TPB.
If someone needs the broadcast version too then let me know in the comments i upload it.

on vista sp2"
,mistarz,2012-08-29T20:06Z,"At rayquest9.

Well it will work on Vista I'm 80% sure cuz i use a mac.
But still you need to have Cinema 4D installed.
As for photoshop CS6 in a way yes it will work.I mean you can export your composition you made whit this plugin to make a PS 3d file and then import that in Ae.
But i will not work for Photoshop as a standalone plugin.

I hope this helped.

All the best.
