An amazingly tasteless production, Andrea Bianchi's sordid masterpiece of Mafia revenge is legitimately available on Italian DVD from Flamingo Video. 

Sadly, there's no English subtitles, but there is a "FAN friendly version" utilizing the English dubbed track married to the Flamingo print and English subs for the scenes that were apparently cut for its US release. 

What's astonishing about the Italian version are the sheer number of cut scenes and bits and pieces of gore and sexual violation that are missing from the US version.

An entire sequence that sets up the whole plot is completely gone from the dubbed edition which no doubt made for a confusing ordeal to those that caught it in theaters in America.

Any fan of exploitation cinema should give this movie a viewing. However, it's vitally important that you skip the English dubbed release. 

If the film is minus any subtitled scenes, or isn't completely in Italian, you're missing out on one of the nastiest most vicious movies in all of cinema.
