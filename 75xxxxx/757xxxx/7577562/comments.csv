,xpmule,2012-08-29T16:02Z,"glad i can help :)

don't worry that it says the dimensions are 640x480 people it seems to look like its 720p. I never modified this file in anyway before i uploaded. So what i'm saying is 640 is a 4:3 display ratio but when i play it it shows up as 16:9. So anyways don't let that scare people away from it ;)
Strange stuff to me lol"

,UAofE,2012-08-30T13:24Z,No one uses MKV? Are you a fucking retard? Nearly all videos on BT use the MKV container.
,xpmule,2012-08-30T13:59Z,"i noticed avi's are released by MSD for the whole season. SO...
If you need this last one to finish off the season as avi i understand that ;)
It always bugs me when i have mixed formats during a season i've downloaded.

,mness,2012-08-31T10:30Z,thx for the xtra efforts to bring this to us.  well done
,Ignignot78,2012-09-03T15:32Z,"No, not ""most"" use MKV. More uploaders are using it theses day tho. Idk the difference or why an uploader prefers 1 to the other. But MKV's suck for me because I transfer everything to a flash drive and play through my Xbox....which will not recognize MKV. So, I hate MKV, but I'm not an uploader so I can't rly bitch about it."
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-09-13T00:55Z,"AVIs take ages to make from dvds etc etc MKV comes direct from the tv/dvd/dvr recorder & is ready to go-i too hate it as i have a divx dvd player & so they all have to be converted to dvd for that-otherwise mPC copes fine with them,thats why they are so popular-no conversion time on auto gordian knot & dvd shrink !
