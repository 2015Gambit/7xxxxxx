'Batman - Arkham Unhinged Omnibus Vol 1'

DC Comics, 2012

Chapters 1-37, 754 pages, as one big ass file

All 13 covers are positioned as pages 1-13, followed by 741 uninterrupted story pages. No chapter credits pages, no ads, no tag pages. Just the covers and the story.

I chose to do the collected chapter and omnibus versions at this point because Chapter 37 was the end to the first large Arkham Unhinged story arc. Issue 38 clearly begins telling a different story.

Other than the covers, which had to be renamed to move them to the top of the order, I did not change the file names for this edition. Changing nearly 800 file names once was MORE than enough. As such (for those who care about such things), the naming convention for the files within this edition are the same as those used for the collected chapter parts (Batman - Arkham Unhinged Pt 1-13). 

For information regarding who did the writing and art on 'Batman - Arkham Unhinged', take a look at each of the collected chapter parts. You can do a Pirate Bay search for 'Arkham Unhinged' and all 13 of them will return as part of the results.
