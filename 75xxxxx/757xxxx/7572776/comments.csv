,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-27T07:58Z,"This was such a treat! As I opened it to check it out in CDisplayEx, I watched as the page count increased. At 400 I thought, ""no way is it more than 500 pages"" then it kept going up and up past 700! 

Thanks a lot. We need comics uploaders like you in the wake of the demon."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-27T20:27Z,"You're both most welcome. I don't think I'm doing anything different from a bunch of other great uploaders, just filling in some selection holes.

Seeing as how people keep mentioning it in the comments, Demonoid must have been (is?) a great place to get comic books. Personally, I never used it. Never even went there. "
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-27T23:41Z,Yea there are other great uploaders and demonoid was amazing for comics. I just wanted to thank you specifically as I hadn't really gotten any of your books before and wanted to express my appreciation that you take the time to put up these great books.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-28T00:06Z,"Hey! Don't get me wrong! The acknowledgments are great! And they serve two purposes.

One, without them, I probably would have stopped uploading already. But as long as I get a comment here or there to let me know people are interested I've got a LONG way to go.

Two, the comments often help me decide what to upload next, or what general direction to go in, anyway.

I just don't want to take away from what all the other great uploaders do. They're what inspired me to give it a try to begin with."
,swooshq,2012-08-28T01:57Z,thanks!
,captinkill,2012-08-29T03:52Z,Thank You
,Phaedron,2012-08-29T08:25Z,"I hope you do continue to upload and can't wait to see what else you have.  By the way, since you say you never went to Demonoid I have to ask where you got your comics if you don't mind.  I have been looking around for good sites for comics since they were shut down and wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-08-29T20:46Z,"Regarding where to get comic books, well, first of all, I have scanned some of these myself because I do still collect physical copies of the stuff I like.

Also, I used btjunkie A LOT for a long time, because it would return search results for files WITHIN a torrent. That's the only thing I find lacking about TPB. I've also been using TPB for a long time, and there's actually quite a bit more here than it looks like sometimes, but you can't always see it unless you do some creative searching and dig through the contents of larger torrents.

Lastly, SLSK! SLSK has had a thriving comic book sharing community for years. Yeah, it takes a little longer to get what you're looking for (sometimes much longer). But it's free! So no complaints. The trick at SLSK is to search for whatever you're looking for with cbr at the end, then search again with cbz at the end.

So, something like...

Peter Bagge cbr

Peter Bagge cbz

Or...

Astro City cbr

Astro City cbz

Hope that helps"
