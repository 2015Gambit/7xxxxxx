Notes: Video:
got that nice very big cam source, thought i give it a try, even though there are lots
of versions already out and i didnt have time the last days, here is my version
the cam had a bad angle, needed rotating and some perspective, after couple tries
i found a nice way without loosing that much video. tried to preserve the complete
height of the video only 16 lines lost, added brightness and contrast and tried to
remove some noise in the video

Audio:
Seen already made a fine job on syncing, thx btw
Took the audio and cleaned it through and made another complete syncround

all in all it got nice, if you still want another version, perhaps this is the one
will do me till retail comes around
enjoy
