ChemDraw Ultra 12 is an outstanding package for chemical structure drawing and editing.

The Document Settings feature gives this package an edge when preparing chemical schemes for manuscripts that will be published. The graphics prepared in ChemDraw Ultra insures a professional and neat appearance.

ChemDraw Ultra allows you to import a variety of image formats that may be edited or modified as needed, including CML, GIF, BMP, JPEG, ISIS, MDL, TIFF and Galactic and Jcamp spectra files.
