Notes: Ok first off ....reason for readnfo <<< too let you know that the video
is made up of 4 videos Quality and AR changes due too different sources and 
difference res that needed too be changed so we could append all the pieces
The first 53secs and last 2mins are from 26k vobs,Around 1 min at the end is from
ILLUMINATI,then we have around 4 mins in 4 different parts from a special friend
and then the rest and the main body of this is from yes thats right another special
friend

All the videos have been worked on alot and done all the normal stuff....would
take ages to write what had to be done too every piece

Audio was from riplegendz and had too be shrink to fit the encode and then still
needed some TLC due to all the joins Audio was nice,but had a fair amount of noise
too it so thats been cleaned up after we syncd it

Some scenes are dark so i would say this is 99.9% in sync and if it drifts a tad
it will only be by 100ms etc and not for long at all

Anyway enjoy folks
