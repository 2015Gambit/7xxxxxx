,xpmule,2012-08-28T06:37Z,"thanks for the RETAIL version.

i have no idea why they make a trial + retail i did some binary comparisons last night and i can't tell much with out debugging. the whole main.exe is recompiled for the retail build !
But the additional drivers etc are no different.

Anyways my previous version keygen from CORE worked again now that i tried it on the retail build (this release uses a previous version ZWT keygen)

whatever works lol"
,xpmule,2012-08-28T06:40Z,"i've been downloading this for so long that i forgot totally about the fact there are two different versions and that the scene keygens never work on the trial. and the torrents posted before this had the trial (the first one did anyway)

now if i could figure out why the hell they released this when build 2900 was just released lol
Anyone have any idea ?"
