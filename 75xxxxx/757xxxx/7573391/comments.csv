,TPBMOFO,2012-08-27T09:54Z,Thank you for not putting the files in 50 .rars. It doesn't save time. It doesn't save space. Why do they bother to do it?
,otnemem,2012-08-27T10:53Z,Because they either live 5 years ago or they don't bother unraring after downloading from their source.
,brewhead,2012-08-27T10:55Z,"""They"" meaning the ""scene"" does it because they use FTP to race and distribute files. File Transfer Protocol works differently than Bittorrent in that one person downloads one file at a time from a single FTP server, or they FXP files between FTP servers. So, having the whole file split into smaller parts makes it easier to replace a single rar if a download screws up or something instead of having to download the COMPLETE file over again. "

,PauloFran,2012-08-27T22:02Z,Thank you!
,balanced,2012-08-29T15:48Z,Yeah but THIS isn't FTP (or USENET which is where it's relevant to use RARs) so THEY need to unrar the shit before posting it HERE with HERE being the torrent protocol which is different from USENET and FTP and that difference means RAR's are SHIT HERE rather than useful they are wasteful.  Nobody torrents a 'part' of a file like they do on USENET.
