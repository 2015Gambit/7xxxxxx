Ponderosa's first album, 2011's Joe Chiccarelli-produced Moonlight Revival, had a southern roots rock roadhouse sound with just a touch of country thrown in, a bit like an alt-country version of the Black Crowes. The group's second effort, Pool Party, released just a year later, is a whole other matter. Produced by Dave Fridmann of Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev fame, Pool Party is full of echoing vocals, muted guitars, backwards guitars, dreamy keyboards, neo-psychedelic touches and an air of care and importance that puts them a lot closer on this outing to a dollar store version of the Flaming Lips than it does the Blasters, say, and it is such a pronounced change of direction, it should almost be looked at as a different band, or a second debut album.
