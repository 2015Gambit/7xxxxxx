I know no one listens to cassettes today! But 20-25 years back, CDs were either rarely available or way too expensive for me. In those days cassette was king! I have a collection of over 300 cassettes of that era from mid-80s to mid-90s. A large number of them is unplayable today. So with a heavy heart, I have finally decided to dispose them off. But before doing so, I shall scan all the covers.

In this torrent, I am sharing with you covers of 50 cassettes. They are scanned at 600dpi and all are single-sided meaning there is nothing printed on the reverse side. Most of them are albums. In future, I shall share with you compilations, greatest hits & double-sided covers depending on the response to this torrent. Full list is included in the torrent. So now you'll know what I was listening to as a teenager! Do write in your comments.
