I started learning Korean, and I try to get as much of the language as possible by watching Korean dramas, movies and listening to music.

So I'd like to ask whether or not the next part will be in Japanese or Korean language, or will it be some kind of mixed thing? Because I assume that if the Japanese make songs in Korea then it should be in that language, right? ;D

Anyway thanks for all the torrents you have already, and you will upload. "

The next volume will have only songs made ​​for the japanese market by korean artists. It's ​​for those who like j-pop get in touch with k-pop.
The following volumes will have songs in korean language again."
