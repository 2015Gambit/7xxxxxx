First you must install the HD Caller ID Pro v2.2.9 Final By bobiras2009.apk

and then install the Key By bobiras2009.apk"

I have done that, i installed the apk HD Caller ID, then installed the Pro Key, it tells me that my HD Caller ID is now pro, but it still has the adds on it when i miss a call or when im just in the app!!!
Does the key definitly work??

Yes the key worked the pro version isnt for remove the ads it adds some more feautres.

For the ads in all of your apps/games you must install this:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adaway&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5hZGF3YXkiXQ..

It remove all the ads for every app/game and it is free."
