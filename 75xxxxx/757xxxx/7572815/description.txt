Dear Fellow Pirate,

     Thank you for even reading this, I am very grateful. I am teaching myself flash programming and am very ignorant in it. I have posted this in several places forums.adobe.com | flashcheats.org | etc. | before but am still lost. So I decided to ask this community. If you don't know Flash Programming, then unfortunately (for me) you can't help :'(

But on the flip side, if you do know flash programming then thank you for helping me. You can reach me at Yanallboutros@hotmail.com (please don't spam) If and when you have the solution. I am still in the very beginning of the book i purchased, so I hope that you can help me.
