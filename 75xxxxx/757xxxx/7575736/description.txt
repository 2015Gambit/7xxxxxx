"Looking back over 40 years television and print journalists recall their stories and memories of reporting the murder of President Kennedy and how it changed the country and changed the way the public gets its news." I've added some sound files of the radio coverage, plus some text files and images with background info, including the story of Merriman Smith who was first to break the story to the wire services and gave us the phrase "grassy knoll". Enjoy.
