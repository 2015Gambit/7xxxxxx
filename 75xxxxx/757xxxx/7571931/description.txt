aka 'Anno - Create a New World' in Europe
aka 'Dawn of Discovery' in USA
but Anno-game names are fucking confusing (see: 'Anno 1602 - Creation of a New World' and 'Anno 1701 - Dawn of Discovery'), so all you need to know this is the game which takes place in year 1404 - that's why i renamed the game.


1) update partition have been removed.

2) compressed in .WIA (Wii Iso Archive) format

.wia files are 35% smaller than .WBFS in average as the game data itself is compressed too, not only the unused bytes.

.wia files are 65% smaller(!) than .ISO in average (calculated by 127 games)
info about .WIA: http://wit.wiimm.de/info/wia.html


use 'WIT' to uncompress to .wbfs or .iso e.g: "wit copy example.wia example.wbfs"
