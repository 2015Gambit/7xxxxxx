Match of the Day Two 26.08.2012

Duration: 1 Hour

Colin Murray presents highlights of the day's two Premier League fixtures.

Champions Manchester City travelled to Liverpool for the Reds' first top flight home match under the management of Brendan Rodgers. Anfield has not been a happy hunting ground for City in recent years, they are winless in their last nine trips dating back to 2003.

Stoke hosted Arsenal in day's other game with trips to the Britannia Stadium not a favoured destination for Arsene Wenger's men either. The Gunners have tasted victory only once in four attempts since the Potters won promotion. There is also a round-up of all of Saturday's eight matches.
