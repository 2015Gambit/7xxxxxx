This is a collection of radio programs from the Vinyl Cafe radio show with Stuart Mclean.


The Vinyl Cafe is an hour-long radio variety show, hosted by Stuart McLean and broadcast on 

CBC radio, BBC Radio 7 and on several U.S. public radio stations. It airs Sunday at noon on 

Radio One and Saturday at 10 a.m. on Radio Two, and is also available as a podcast, 

although the podcasts are usually just McLean's stories.

These are full episodes that were recorded with Audacity from the On-line radio broadcast.

The show features essays, weird stuff, fiction and music; while frequently humorous, the 

weekly programs are also often wistfully nostalgic. The show also endeavours to introduce 

listeners to new Canadian musical talent.

The show is independently produced by McLean and sold to the CBC. Each season has 

approximately 22 new episodes. Half of those are recorded in the studio and the other half 

are done with live audiences in theatres across Canada.

A major feature of many of McLean's shows are the "Dave and Morley Stories," featuring a 

fictional Toronto family. The name "Vinyl Cafe" refers both to the show's musical content, 

and the fictional record shop owned by McLean's character Dave. This aspect of the show has 

spawned a number of books of short stories, as well as audio recordings.
Every episode ends with McLean's signature signoff, "I'm Stuart McLean, so long for now," 

followed by the show's folksy guitar theme song, "Happy Meeting In Glory" (as performed by 

Ry Cooder). The show is produced by Jess Milton. Meg Masters is the long-suffering story 

editor and the show's founding producer is Dave Amer.
