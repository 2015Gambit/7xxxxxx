Stravaganza is a series of novels 
written by Young Adult's author Mary Hoffman. The books are 
set alternatively between Islington, an area of London, England, 
and various cities in Talia, an alternate version of Renaissance 
Italy.

The series originally consisted of a trilogy of books: 
1-City of Masks
2-City of Stars
