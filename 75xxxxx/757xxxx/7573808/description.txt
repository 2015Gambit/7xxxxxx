This is the original 1975 release of "The Boob Tube" copied from video tape.
Found the movie using Crux P2P. Seems all other torrents claiming to be this movie are actually XXX from a porn series named Boob Tube. This one is now rated as PG 17 instead of the R at it's release. Classic T&A parody.

I first saw it at the "Midnight Movies" sponsored by a local rock station in Columbus, Ohio in the late 70's, along with movies such as Tunnel Vision, The Groove Tube, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii and The Wall, Eraserhead, and Fritz the Cat, to name a very few.

Hope you enjoy this movie!
