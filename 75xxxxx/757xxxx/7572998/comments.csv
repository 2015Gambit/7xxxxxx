,botzone,2012-08-28T11:25Z,sigh no appendix for receipes
,Caveman327,2012-08-28T22:51Z,"Listed on the Table of Contents page next to the crafting recipes page:

""Please visit www.bradygames.com/GW2updates for a downloadable list of crafting recipes and other updates as they become available.""

So basically they added a ToC entry for crafting recipes and never added the actual information. Another win for Bradygames."
