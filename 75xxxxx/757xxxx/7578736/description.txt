Trees biography

A few years into the British folk-rock boom, came along a band called the TREES, that got slagged off by the mindless British weekly press as FAIRPORT CONVENTION sound-alike. If those so-called journalist had actually listened, they might have seen their mistake as the TREES were a lot more like the fantastically fabulous The PENTANGLE but only even more progressive. True the dual guitarist and female singer was a sort of blueprint (almost clich√©) for bands of those days into folk-rock, but here the musical interplay got uncommon space to develop and the numbers frequently grew longer in time, something rare in the genre and only followed by COMUS. But that SMBWMP (stupid mindless British weekly music press) would keep on deriding this band that folded after two excellent but unsuccessful albums.

The TREES (along with the other bands mentioned in this article) are recommended to everyone wanted to investigate the folkish side of progressive rock and its acoustic side.
