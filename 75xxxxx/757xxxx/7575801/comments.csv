Hey mate.Do this:

do a clean installation
wipe data, uninstall then install the apk
turn on wifi or 3G to verify the license
then launch the game

I will upload the Checking Compatibility OFF in a minute for the Gangstar rio so it wont check the license.

@makasif

You must edit the build.prop in system folder and change the name of your device to for example HTC Desire HD for playing most gameloft games.This is the olny way to play these games."

Check here mate:

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1556612

you must edit the lines:

ro.product.device - Change the device name
ro.product.model - change the model number

to ro.product.device HTC
ro.product.model Desire HD

It requires root but with this you can play any gameloft game.

@namos

In most devices it is ok with the license and it plays fine.There are some also that need the remove license apk for the gangstar rio"
