,xpmule,2012-08-26T21:12Z,"ya and i don't know why you wouldn't know this..

If your trying to build a name for yourself maybe try uploading some of the many millions of new releases that re put out on a daily basis.

A quick google search and you can see nfo database sites listing tons of shit in every category AND another quick google search you can find direct (file locker) download licks for these..
ANd i could posta  ton of URL's for example.
But i won't lol"
,xpmule,2012-08-26T21:14Z,"by the way i wasn't gonna mention it because i'm not trying to advertise my torrents on other peoples pages but coincidentally i was the first guy that uploaded the newest version of Aida64
2 days ago to TPB. Click my user name if you want for the link to it etc.."
