It's an EVOLVE problem - both MP4 & MKV versions."
,vivatpb5776,2012-08-28T13:51Z,"I concur with pc-Gnome. I have tested every available Season 1 Episode 3 (both Evolve and others) and the glitch is prevalent in all of  them. There are two scenebalance .torrents that are downloading but I have tested all others as of 7:10am EST.

That being said, it only appears that a few seconds are missing, if that. Lt. Provenza is still on hold and they are still in the same scene. If you do not care about this than the rest of the show appears fine. If you are like me and keep the show for archival purposes, you may want to wait until there is a better copy available.

I will update this .torrent once a valid download is available."

The slight glitch only ate up a few seconds of the show and the time lost does not take away from the overall show itself. I am sure someone will re-up this episode at some point."
