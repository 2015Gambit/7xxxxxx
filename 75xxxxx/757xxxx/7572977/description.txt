Muscle Man is walking with his girlfriend Starla, pranking people and she tells him to go to a fancy restaurant called "Bistro en le Parc", and not Wing Kingdom with her parents so they can take their relationship to the next level. However, Muscle Man has a hard time being fancy, such as struggling to reserve spots at the resturaunt, so he asks Mordecai and Rigby to help give him advice. Mordecai takes Muscle Man to a mall to buy fancy outfits, and since Muscle Man struggles at being fancy, Rigby gives him a headset so he can command him to do the right thing. Muscle Man goes to the dinner with Starla and her parents, with Mordecai and Rigby sneaking around pretending to be waiters and telling him what to do. At first Muscle Man has a hard time trying to impress Starla's parents, but when Muscle Man finally starts getting it right, a strange waiter spies on them and strangles Mordecai and Rigby, breaking their headsets. He then gives Muscle Man three spoons and a creme brulee. With no help, Muscle Man picks the wrong spoon and starts a fight. Starla's parents tell Muscle Man that they were feigning being fancy, and they act just like them, so they attack the waiters. The episode ends with Muscle Man, Starla and her parents eating at Wing Kingdom.
