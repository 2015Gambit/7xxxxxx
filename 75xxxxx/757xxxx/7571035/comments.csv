,samdg,2012-09-05T13:00Z,"It works!

1. Use HJSPLIT - a windows application to join the file parts.
2. You get a .toast file
3. Mount it in OSX
4. Install
Done!"

Stuffit Archive Manager v15.0.4 joined, and unpacked it for me.

This is a light version that usually comes with a purchase of hardware (i.e. keyboard)

I ebay'ed my keyboard, and the seller had lost the disc, so this was a good alternative. 

@ClayMan812
It's a free registration for a Lite version - I do wish there was more MAC programmers/coders."
