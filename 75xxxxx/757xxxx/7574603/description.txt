Description:
Outcry is a psychological graphical point and click adventure game. The game is played through the eyes of the main character, in first person perspective. You receive a letter from your brother, a scientist, who invites you to his home so that he can show you the results of his project, and you can get some ideas for your next book. However, once you arrive you find that your brother has mysteriously vanished, leaving all his material possessions to you - including a large, strange machine and a message telling you not to reproduce his experiments. Disregarding your brothers warning, you start looking for clues that will help you find your missing brother. You discover that the machine he has created is an instrument for making a person disconnect the mind from the body. Recreating the experiment as best you can, you travel to a surreal, dream like place your brother calls The Shimmering World to save him.

Bonus: soundtrack.
