My sincere apologies to the members & staffs of Ahashare,
I uploaded a movie 2 days back: ( The Cabin In The Woods 2011)
It was raining when I uploaded the torrent and the speed was extremely slow,
Hence i commented about the bad speed, after I commented I lost internet completely.
The rain never stopped from then on , its flood & drought from that moment…
There is no internet or electricity from 2 days and I couldn’t seed the movie….
I request you to go ahead and delete the torrent, I will upload the movie once everything turns normal here….
I am using my mobile internet and they have blocked access to all torrent websites..
TPB was also blocked, but because of the recent domain change from ORG to SE, I am able to login here…
It will be great if you can delete the torrent.  Convey my apologies to FLEX as well

Regards,
Hiest"
