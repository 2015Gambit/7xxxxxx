,ingr.osei,2012-08-28T22:15Z," chugalugg,why did it take you so long to attempt a purchase,you've got what I call foolish pride,this kind of pride usually kills,you really need JESUS in your life.you really do;pray for his help.You are really lost.The use of vulgar language only makes you sink deeper into the pits o hell."
,Chugalugg,2012-08-28T22:43Z,"Play your missionary tune to someone who gives a shit, By the way Captain, lol, hows the plane handling today, you fucking bullshit artist. You being a real Airline Pilot and all, should be able to give us great details. You and that fucking God bless shit is getting real old. And so is this soap opera. I'm done with you. Your not worth the typing effort. "
,Chugalugg,2012-08-28T22:53Z,"By the way your Holyness ingr.osei, You do realize that what we do here is a form of stealing, hence the name Piratebay, moron. Shove that in your collection plate.  "

,boinga,2012-08-31T19:29Z,ingr.osei can you provide an .exe of this release because it doesn't work. maybe some files are missing because gadges and gear don't work for me!!:( but thx for the seed !
,ingr.osei,2012-09-01T13:05Z,"I added a reg file,pls try running it and let's see if it responds positively,I'm seeding the exe version now (I don't know how long it will seed),the problem is that my keyfile is not enough to go around for everyone on the bay.
sadly some poeple are out there spitting phlegm at me for trying to share what I have."
,ingr.osei,2012-09-01T13:24Z,"Well Chugaloooooog,I'm not taking from the bay,I'm sharing,besides you seem to have a very big problem with my aviation background,what is the problem here.You may probably be bitter with me for personal reasons,well I wish I could do something about that.
My being Pius has kept me from being rough,perhaps you should try same.
Have a nice love filled day and may the good Lord GOD show you some mercy.

PS:we are not at war,this is only a piece of brotherly advice,you know virtualanarchy tried to offer some good advice and you started railing at him which isn't fair,we are not here to insult each other but to share what we have,this is a form of social networking,not a platform for invectives and an avenue to let out in-built bitter feelings which have developed over the years.
Be at peace with all men and let's live as one big family period."
,camus_to,2012-09-03T18:48Z,"@ingr.osei: Or you should ignore the one who abusing you here. Do you think this guy will listen to you and stop abusing you here?

btw, are you a real pilot? anyway, thank for sharing here bro."
