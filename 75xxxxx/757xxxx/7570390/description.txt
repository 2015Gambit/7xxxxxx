I prefer to utilize these books as image files, so I left them that way. If you want to make them into a pdf file and reupload, GO FOR IT! :D

My scanner had a bit of trouble picking up light pencil lines, so some of the photos of the sketches and really light sketches are hard to see. This is mostly a problem in the first two books, but the important illustrations look fine (they were drawn dark enough). Sorry!
