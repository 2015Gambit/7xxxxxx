,suckerp,2012-08-28T14:02Z,"guys it doesnt work. im using the skidrow version. the game worked before the dlcs, and now when i replaced everything, it wont start up."
,unaim,2012-08-28T23:04Z,"Please, somehow I didn't  get the HD-pack when i downloaded the whole game and i do not want the download the whole game again (got really slow internet) so could you Aviara upload that DLC pack, or does anyone know where do get just that HD texture dlc pack?

I have been looking around myself for it."
,0rochimaru,2012-08-29T04:16Z,"DLC works.  Just extract and cut-paste to your game directory.  I think I'm running the Skidrow version.

*Make a back-up first in case it doesn't work for you."
