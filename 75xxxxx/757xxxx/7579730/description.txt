Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, August 28 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers facets of the police state that appear daily, including the latest manifestation in Austin, Texas, where students are being tracked with GPS technology, and Blackhawk helicopters engaging in military exercises in the skies over Minneapolis, Minnesota. He also talks about events ongoing in Syria and Iran. 

Alex's guest today is Alfred Adask, the publisher of the AntiShyster News Magazine who was identified by the federal government as one of the top dozen anti-government activists during the 1990s. He was featured on a CBS 60 Minutes segment where he was pigeonholed as a Sovereign Citizen "guru."
