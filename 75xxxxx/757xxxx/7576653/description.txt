Found this on the net. I watched it.. and its the right episode
And it looks fine, totally watchable

although the site i got it from listed it as a release from NTB
and the file extension was .mkv but when after checking the video
it did NOT have a matroska container it was actualy an FLV container.
AND the file size for NTB's release is suppose to be about 110mb
but this release is about 41 mb.

This will have to do until something better comes along.

here is the MediaInfo report.
