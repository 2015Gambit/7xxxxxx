,xpmule,2012-08-28T06:19Z,"i wonder if the scene groups not releasing this super late if at all has something to do with anti-pircay efforts.
I know LionsGat owns the rights to this show and they have been sending out ceas and desist letters and targeting google for indexed sites etc
And all of this started with LionsGate and others a day or two after SOPA failed.
See this for added info..

,xpmule,2012-08-28T06:53Z,posting see i can see new comments..
,Negumiko,2012-08-28T07:45Z,Video quality was good. Audio was choppy for the first half of the episode and then the audio just stopped working completely.
,xhizors,2012-08-28T08:16Z,"Negumiko: Audio was only choppy during the opening credits, and then played perfectly for the rest of the episode. Whatever problem you had is with your computer/player."
,xpmule,2012-08-28T08:36Z,if it helps anyone.. i used shark007's codec pack on Win7 x64 and the video seemed fine for me (set to use FFDshow for audio and video + hali for splitter)
