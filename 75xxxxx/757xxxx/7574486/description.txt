Visual Assist - a powerful plugin for Visual Studio

Generic version patch from LCG included = you save $249 lol

So more than likely you can go to www.wholetomato.com
and download the next update and run this generic patch again :)

This is the only add-in I like, VS with out it sucks.
And it will work for almost all OS's and VS ide's
