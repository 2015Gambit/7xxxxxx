Following the release of the cult-classic film Clerks in 1994,
long time friends Jason "Jay" Mewes and Kevin "Silent Bob"
Smith quickly became much loved stoner icons, with their
mischievous characters going on to star in Mallrats, Chasing
Amy, Dogma, Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks 2.

Fast-talking, foul mouthed Jay and his "hetero life partner"
Silent Bob hit DVD with their highly praised live comedy show,
direct from London, Manchester and Edinburgh. No two shows
are ever the same!
