Thanks KrazyKrvs. I found subtitles for this.

If you list English subtitles in the description, please, include them. Your mentor SUJAIDR would never forget.

 Subtitles on the internet are notoriously bad. It takes a speaker of both languages to pick out the good ones. Since I do not speak Hindi, I can only guarantee that these subtitles I found are synchronized with the speech. They do not seem to be machine translated, but that doesn't mean they are any good. 

Please read them, and let us know if they are acceptable. If you find they are not as good as some others, then please include a link to the good ones."
