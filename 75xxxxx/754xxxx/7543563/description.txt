This recording was the first bluegrass LP ever released. The reissue now contains 16 additional tracks, a total of 43 tunes played by the immortal Snuffy Jenkins and others, including Smiley Hobbs. A banjo classic that runs 60 minutes in length. "...[A]s unspoiled as the day they were recorded..." ΓÇö Rolling Stone
