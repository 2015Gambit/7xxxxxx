In the not-too-distant future, the world has been overrun with criminals,
who now hold the power over the well-intentioned authority figures.

Only a small handful of people are willing to stand up and fight for justice.
This small band of police officers is led by martial arts legend Ron Marchini, the Omega Cop.

With his small band of officers dying all around him, Marchini must become
a one-man army and take on scores of criminals on his own. This sounds like an impossible task,
but Marchini's resourcefulness is unmatched, and he begins knocking the criminals off one-by-one.
