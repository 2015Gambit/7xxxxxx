You don't say a torrent is being tracked unless it actually is. If you got some sort of notification from an ISP or otherwise that you yourself are responsible for, then just say so. People want to know that kind of thing. But ""visiting a website and getting banned for even mentioning it"" doesn't mean a damned thing. WTF are you talking about exactly? How in the hell does that mean it's tracked? If you're gonna claim something is tracked, give a valid reason why, not your fucked up assumptions. Was it even a torrent site? Or some internet forum that doesn't allow users to talk about torrents (my guess)? BTW it was so nice of you to come back and clarify. /sarcasm"
,shikaruto,2012-08-26T08:23Z,"BTW (forgot to comment on the file)

A:whatever, all movies have shit sound nowadays turn the sound up to max just to hear talking
V:10 (looks great)

To people bitching about bluray this, HD that:

Not everyone has a decent computer. In fact, most people have shit computers, even more so for the people who torrent, because were poor and can't affod to go to the movies, let alone have a computer that can play bluray rips. If you can, then why the fuck are you bitching about free shit? Also, a lot of streaming devices can't handle that crap. And bitching about filesize? Really? No one gives a shit that you keep all the movies you pirate (porn) and will never watch again (actual movies) so now you have no space.
