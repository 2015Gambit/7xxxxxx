Most programs I used or tested were either too complicated or just plain ugly in their user interface (some even seem to come from an ancient time, like the 90s). None of them made use of the two-screen environment many users have nowadays – they all tried to integrate the preview into the main window or even allowed previewing only after selecting an image, not simultanously.



Features:

Two-Window (resizable) interface: one window to browse your files, another window for the preview or slideshow
Two alternative viewing modes: fit-to-window (resizable window) or original size, with zoom factor (10..200%)
High quality, fast thumbnail generation (bicubic resizing with sharpener filter is applied), even for > 10 Megapixel photos
Magnifier glass with changeable magnification factor (drag mouse wheel to zoom in or out)
Slideshow feature with 22 transition effects (3D transitions included: page flipping and rotating cube)
Lossless rotation, EXIF support, crop / resize / tilt and simple but powerful image editor
Batch processing with watermark/stamping tool, resizing and renaming; export to PDF / print of “contact sheets”
Supported image formats: JPG/JPEG (with EXIF info), JP2 (JPG 2000), PNG, GIF, BMP, TIF/TIFF, TGA, PCX, ICO"
