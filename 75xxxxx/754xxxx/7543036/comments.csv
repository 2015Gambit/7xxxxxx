Our electricity went off when there were about five or six minutes left to go in the second hour of WRH. I was able to save what I had recorded up to that point because I was recording on my little old netbook. The stream was gone, of course, because the modem and router were dead.

I knew I had all of hour one and certainly the first half of hour two, intact. So, as time passed and the power was not restored by the time Mike's show was over, I resolved to use my recording as source for files 1a, 1b, and 2a. The rest I intended to get from RBN's podcast archive.

But no. RBN chose not to make the second hour available today. The only thing left for me to do was to use the partial second-half of hour two that I had recorded. Sorry to not be able to share the whole show, but you're only missing about six minutes or slightly less. Hour 3 is edited from an RBN podcast file.
