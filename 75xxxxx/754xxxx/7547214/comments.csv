,bleslie1,2012-08-19T22:19Z,"I've been watching a little over a year now thanks to Msfenmore :)

I saw a promo for the show on youtube and this is the only place i could find full episodes in good quality. I'm so hooked now lol

Thanks for fixing the sound! You seriously are awesome for all your work you do for us! Love love love love this show!! "
,bleslie1,2012-08-20T00:26Z,"Oh, and did you guys hear about Ronn Moss (Ridge) leaving the show??? It's crazy... if I'm not mistaken he's one of the four original actors who've been on since the first episode.

His last episode is supposed to air September 14th :("
,disneydreams,2012-08-20T20:55Z,thank you so much for putting up the soaps every day.
,MsMuffet,2012-08-21T03:50Z,"R I P Phyllis Diller
Thanks Ms Fenmore for providing the only copies of her very last performances (probably her last TV appearance in fact) in episode 6276 and 6277. She is a great loss to comedy.
Working to make others smile ... to the very end."
,bleslie1,2012-08-21T06:46Z,"That's so sad :(

I never saw her when she was originally on but she was hilarious in those 2 episodes of B&B...

Some more bad news just broke about the show too.. Susan Flannery (Stephanie) is also backing out. Not sure when her last day is :(

With Ridge and Stephanie gone I'm really worried about the show getting cancelled or something."
,atzensuisse,2012-08-22T12:01Z,"Didn't know about Ridge [Ron Moss] leaving the show bleslie1, that's a shocker all right!!! Sept 14th his last show??? Wow, he's been one of the rocks of this show.  & if Susan Flannery (Stephanie) walks out also, it's sounding like the death knell of this wonderful show, but at the same time B&B is such a hit that replacements might come in!!!! Why kill it eh!!! MsMuffet - the news about Phyllis Diller is a blow, didn't know she had faded into the sunset, rip ole girl. Those two episodes as Gladys were memorable!!! "
,jamespoos,2012-09-03T05:30Z,"hello the frame rate on your videos is wrong it should be 23.976fps also the audio Hz are wrong it should not be 44100Hz it should be 48000Hz
