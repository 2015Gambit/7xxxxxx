,o2cui2i2,2012-08-19T09:23Z,"fyi: call it a cam and put it in the regular video file. this is NOT high res!!! it's not even an R5 never mind a 720 version. 

just because you call it 720p doesn't make it so. it's not even in focus. 

just sayin"
,Luck107,2012-08-20T16:32Z,"@o2cui2i2: It was shot with a HD cam thats why 720p is in the title, but you're right it's no a Bluray rip."
,Luck107,2012-08-20T16:34Z,@soletar: you're not the only one! I want to hear Bane's voice before they edited it.  xD
