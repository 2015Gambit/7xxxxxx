Curious George is an animated television series based on the Curious George children's book series, which features Jeff Bennett as the voice of The Man with the Yellow Hat. Frank Welker, who voiced George in the 2006 feature film, returns here as the voice of Curious George. The show is currently broadcast on PBS Kids.


When the show was developed, educational advisors suggested using it to teach science, math, and engineering concepts. Episodes are often structured around a "try-fail" series of incidents, which proved to be a good way to show scientific inquiries. 

These were encoded by me, from my digital recordings off my local PBS station. I had posted them to Demonoid previously, but since that site may be gone permanently I decided to share them here.

If you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. I have the entire series recorded off television, and if people keep seeding I will continue to post more episodes.
