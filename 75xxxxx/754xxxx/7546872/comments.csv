,thegameksk,2012-08-29T02:53Z,Does this  by any chance contain the 10 day slim down pdf and the meal plan pdf?
,exoskeleton115x,2012-09-04T05:54Z,hye does it have sound i downloaded a first one it was just the dvd but no audio and another one was just the audio does this one have both.....
,Kra3zd,2012-09-04T17:11Z,"Yes, This has sound and everything, it's ISO so it's just like having the original DVDs. I had actually gotten this from another site so the credit is not mine. I had also posted it up on my old account. It doesn't contain the slim down guide or diet plan. Only the workout calender and fitness guide which is just a way of keeping track of your goals. You can download the Home Fitness torrent here at the pirate bay, it's in MKV format, smaller and looks really good. Not many people seeding here so this file will take a long time to download, but there is nothing wrong with it if you want ISO files. "
