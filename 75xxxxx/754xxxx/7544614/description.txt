"Romeo & Juliet" goes back to the Bard's original casting when a group of military school cadets study and act out the play over several days.  The events have a profound effect on the students in the principal roles.  While not for all tastes, the film is well-acted and well-staged on a shoestring budget.  Deserves ****!
