We have another fine LP for you here. Snuffy Jenkins, born in 1908, is pretty much credited with "almost" inventing bluegrass 3-finger style banjo. He was a great banjo picker (he could also play claw-hammer style pretty dang good, too), a fine old-time all-around entertainer in the old medicine show style by being sort of a clown and playing a pretty good washboard set-up. Sometime he would play 3-finger and claw-hammer style in the same song.

Homer "Pappy" Sherrill was a fine "pre-bluegrass" fiddler. I say pre-bluegrass meaning he sort of bridged the gap between old-time fiddlin` and bluegrass style.
Another artist of note on this lp is Julian "Greasy" Medlin. He was a fine guitar picker and medicine (or even minstrel) style entertainer, performing in make-up sort of in the black-face tradition, except he used white paint instead of black. He favored novelty and parody songs. Greasy and Snuffy teamed up as sort of a novety act and I`m sure was hilarious to see!!

Their music is sort of "pre-bluegrass". They were almost too hot on their instruments to be called old-time, but were mabey just a little shy of the "slickness" to be called bluegrass. They had been big radio stars starting in the 30`s playing the different stations as was common then. The were often sponsored by Crazy Water Crystals (if you want to know about Crazy Water Crystals just do a Google search, I`m not going into the colorful history of that on here!!) and were sent by them to play all over the eastern part of the country to play for that sponsor
