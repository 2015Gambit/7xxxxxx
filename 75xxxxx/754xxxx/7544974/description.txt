If you don't know Torpedo, shame on you. It is one of the great european comics, and THE best gangster comic ever made.
Finally IDW released, in a 5 book hardcover deluxe album collection, which you SHOULD run out and buy/order from Amazon, after you have seen this scan. This comic deserve no less.

The first 4 volumes have been scanned by yours truly, the 5th will follow when I get spare time to scan and edit it

This book features nudity, and is not for kids.

Here is an extract of a very fitting review of the series in general:
I say all this because when I started to read the Torpedo series, I was expecting something along the lines of the Parker books, or an 1920s and 30s version of the stories in BrubakerΓÇÖs Criminal series, something dark but ultimately giving me a character that I would love despite his tendency to do despicable things. I would still be on his side.

Luca ΓÇ£TorpedoΓÇ¥ Torelli is just about the most ruthless, conniving, piece of shit protagonist IΓÇÖve ever read. HeΓÇÖs not an anti-hero, heΓÇÖs the worst villain in a world full of other villains. I was wrong.

So hereΓÇÖs the story: Luca is a hitman for hire, taking just about any job that gives him good money. He treats those in shitty situations with a little decency, but you can tell itΓÇÖs primarily to gain their respect once heΓÇÖs on top. He wears expensive clothes, nice shoes and he prefers the priciest women. Once you put your trust in him, youΓÇÖre going to die. If you canΓÇÖt pay him, heΓÇÖs going to attempt to rape and abuse those close to you and then youΓÇÖre going to die. Basically if you see him, the odds of you dying are very high.

The interesting thing through all of this is that it doesnΓÇÖt really seem cartoonish in the same way that more popular villains are portrayed. HeΓÇÖs not insane like Bullseye, heΓÇÖs not unreasonably after control of the world like The Kingpin, heΓÇÖs just a scumbag making his living by picking people off ΓÇô and he believes in survival of the fittest to the highest degree.
