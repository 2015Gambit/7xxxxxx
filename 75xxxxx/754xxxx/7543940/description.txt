Requirements: Android 2.2
Overview: The gangs want you dead. They donΓÇÖt know what theyΓÇÖre in for.

Now you can play 9mm for Android and become John "Loose" Kannon, the leader of a special team of hardened cops that aren't afraid to bend the law to clean up the streets. 


But when they kill a local drug lord's brother and steal millions in cash, the theft makes Kannon's whole team the target of every gangster in the city. Now Kannon has only one option: Take down the gang leader that's hunting them, legally or not, before his team gets taken out first.

HIGH CALIBER ACTION
ΓÇó Dive headlong into this stylish third-person shooter game where youΓÇÖll jump and fire clip after clip from your guns in stunning slow motion stunts to take out rooms full of criminals.
ΓÇó The action simulation really comes to life as destructible 3D environments splinter and explode.

ALL IN A DAYΓÇÖS WORK
ΓÇó These gangsters donΓÇÖt play games, so arm yourself with an arsenal of weapons, including a pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, grenade launcher and more.
ΓÇó Set out to fight crime and corruption in varied locations like the Latino Suburbs, Night Club, Police Department, Rich Suburbs, Industrial Area and Mexico.
ΓÇó Catch gang leaders and informants alive, chasing them through city streets and taking them aside for a not-so-friendly chat in the interrogation challenge.
