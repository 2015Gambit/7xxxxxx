@ Retrenched, not sure if you're an Aussie, but end state is this is all about our childhood years in the 70's, hillarious reliving all the memories of growing up, all the sayings that we used to say, how easy & hard how life was growing up in Australia - the scene is Cronulla NSW (The Shire) I think..."
