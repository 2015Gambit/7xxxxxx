Part 5 : Whales in Crisis 

Few creatures are as mysterious or captivating as the whale. From the Florida Keys to the Arctic waters, from Puget Sound to the islands of the South Pacific, whales today are threatened with new challenges. Watch the struggle unfold as men and women confront the mystery of a sudden 'mass stranding' of a group of pilot whales; an intense controversy brews over the impact of military sonar on whales; and as one scientist endures bone-chilling Arctic water to launch a groundbreaking study of the great bowhead whale. Learn about the increased suicidal behaviours of whales, and the actions taken by those on the front lines of conservation as they fight to ensure that the ocean waters remain a safe home for these magnificent creatures.
