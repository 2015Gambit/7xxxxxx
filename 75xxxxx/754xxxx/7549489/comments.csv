,crazyoliv,2012-08-20T07:54Z,"xVids sucks. x264 Rules. 

x264 means Daubechie wavelet compression and filtering. Beyond being awesomeby itself, x264 gets the quality of the video way much better than xVid compression, which is Fourrier filtering based if I'm not mistaken. 

I'll tell you. xVids sucks. x264 Rules. "

You must be really stupid to have not realized by now that x264 is by far superior to xvid, you stupid cunt."

,ThaDrizzle,2012-08-20T13:50Z,"Guys ever thought the dude might not have your leet-ass devices or whatever.  I used to live off TPB streaming DL's from my kitchen into my bedrooms PS3.  And trust my x246 blew for me.  But, that was then....
I regress, u can still just pop em on a thumb drive and play them on the PS3 that way."
