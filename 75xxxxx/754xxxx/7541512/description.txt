ItΓÇÖs the Middle Class, Stupid! confirms what we have all suspected: Washington and Wall Street have really screwed things up for the average American. Work has been devalued. Education costs are out of sight. Effort and ambition have never been so scantily rewarded. Political guru James Carville and pollster extraordinaire Stan Greenberg argue that our political parties must admit their failures and the electorate must reclaim its voice, because taking on the wealthy and the privileged is not class warfareΓÇöit is a matter of survival. Told in the alternating voices of these two top political strategists, ItΓÇÖs the Middle Class, Stupid! provides eye-opening and provocative arguments on where our governmentΓÇöincluding the White HouseΓÇöhas gone wrong, and what voters can do about it. 

Controversial and outspoken, authoritative and shrewd, ItΓÇÖs the Middle Class, Stupid! is destined to make waves during the 2012 presidential campaign, and will set the agenda for legislative battles and political dust-ups during the next administration.
