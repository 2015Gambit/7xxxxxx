,PattyrRob,2012-08-18T21:40Z,How come my retail key activates this? You would thiink it would take a VL key.
,sat715,2012-08-18T22:02Z,@war59312 do u activated which product key you used.
,raze18,2012-08-19T02:18Z,does this require activation?
,FulcrumX,2012-08-23T00:30Z,"there's still a way to use this blocked product key on 64bit Windows 8 Enterprise/Pro VL, go to cmd, run as admin type the ff: slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C , press enter, after that type in slui 4. press enter. if you got the same set of numbers on blocks 1-9, then you should be able to use the codes shown on blocks A-H. remember this is for 64 bit Windows 8 Enterprise/Pro VL. refer to the pic on the link and just enter the numbers. http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy62/laxluster/CaptureF3G7Cx64.jpg"
