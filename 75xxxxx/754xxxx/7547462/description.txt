Crossing the Event Horizon provides evidence that we are, both
individually and collectively, hurtling toward an evolutionary event
horizon. Using the tools of Jungian psychology, the nature of the
singularity is defined by its myriad manifestations emerging from the
collective unconscious. These include dreams, motifs and themes found in
art, science fiction and fantasy literature and films, religious cults,
and the paranormal, especially near-death experiences and UFO
encounters. Key aspects of the Singularity Archetype include: ΓÇ£Logos
BeheldΓÇ¥ (visually comprehended linguistic intent often associated with a
collective telepathic network), Homo gestalt (a new species where
individuality is conserved but also telepathically networked), and a
parallelism between the individual event horizon of death and eschaton
(the collective event horizon of the species). Apocalypticism is
analyzed as an example of the Singularity Archetype pathologizing. A
study of the HeavenΓÇÖs Gate saucer/suicide cult illustrates what can
happen when people become possessed by the Singularity Archetype and are
driven by it into delusory projections. The Singularity Archetype is
viewed apocalyptically by the ego, and as a transcendent evolutionary
event by the Self, and the duality of these views is explored in many
examples. The evolutionary origins of the ego and its metamorphosis as
it approaches the event horizon are explored. Evolutionary theory, which
relates to the Singularity Archetype through a number of dynamic
paradoxes, is discussed. Many popular books and movies are analyzed as
permutations of the Singularity Archetype, including: Avatar, ChildhoodΓÇÖs End,
Village of the Damned, Powder, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.
