IMPORTANT NOTE: Does not include Conquest of the Wizardlands.

So I was looking around, trying to find a torrent for V1.0.11 of Dungeons of Dredmor, and it turned out there wasn't any. Also, there's nothing at all on V1.1.1 OR Conquest of the Wizardlands! Seriously people, it's been 19 days since release, you are making me lose faith in the internet. Either way, after much searching I was able to find this (after much searching) to tide you guys over until one of you lazypants uploads the Conquest of the Wizardlands torrent.

Please seed, I won't be able to forever!
