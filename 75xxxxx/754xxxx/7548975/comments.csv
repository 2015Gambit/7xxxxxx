It is fully free of DRM and will run on any system without problems.

Just remember to bother to buy it if you like it.

And join us on the forums if you want. The mods are awesome. Get FAXPAX, Compleat Essential Skills, and Roguish Renovations. All are free on the forums."
,OmniNegro,2012-08-20T14:23Z,"By the way, I mean the Gaslamp Games forums. Not the Steam forums for the game. Those are utter bullshit.

Go to gaslampgames.com and click forums. You will see the forums are a friendly place full of mods you will love."
,jikavak,2012-08-20T17:46Z,"OmniNegro,stop spamming the comments with bullshit.Nobody can take your shit seriously if you still think piracy=theft.Most of us would have got the game legit if we could."
,damaro1,2012-08-20T18:38Z,"Piracy is not theft. It is the theoretical loss of hypothetically potential gains. You can't lose a profit you never would have made in the first place :) 
 But yes gaslampgames.com does provide alot of excellent mods for free for this game, just go here for a more complete list http://community.gaslampgames.com/threads/completed-mods-index.1951/"
,OmniNegro,2012-08-21T10:38Z,"Denial does not wash your hands. But live as you choose. 

Piracy is not theft. Right. No argument. But if you would have had to buy it otherwise, is that still not theft?

Anyone have a quote of me saying piracy is theft? Anywhere? Check the Gaslamp Games forums and search for piracy. You will find I argue that since the unit cost of piracy is nearly zero, or infact zero, there is no loss.

I quote the wikipedia page on DRM where Microsoft of all groups says that they want people to steal their software.

You still think I am full of shit? Check the fucking forums before you label me as equating piracy with theft. I walk a fine line. Observe what side you are on."

,jikavak,2012-08-21T11:32Z,"The first post in this comment section- "" But I cannot stop you from stealing it."" 
Draw your strawmen,you don't change anything."
,jikavak,2012-08-21T13:25Z,"Link me to your biography if you wish,I'd love to read that too."
,OmniNegro,2012-08-22T07:00Z,"What is wrong jikivak? Too many tears streaming from your eyes to bother to read what is right under your fat nose?

""Most of us would have got the game legit if we could"" yet you still pretend this is not stealing? Pay more attention to what you write before you pretend you are somehow unprivileged and being repressed by reality or something else you are unprepared for.

Not theft. Not legit. Want to look up the word legitimate? I doubt that very much. You would have to stop crying for a second to bother to look it up.

Your first comment pointed out you are too dumb to speak. The rest point out you really want to try and fail.

To everyone else, enjoy the game. But do buy it once you realize how good it is. (Provided you are able, obviously. Not that a certain troll would bother to buy anything he can steal and then pretend to be a victim about.)"
,jikavak,2012-08-22T10:14Z,"It's just the language I use,and you're a freaking hypocrite.
And yes,when people don't have anything else to say they go with the same old 'you're crying'.

And then,I never did pretend to be 'somehow unprivileged and being repressed by reality or something ',just that I hadn't the ability to buy the game right now.It's not always the white/black you make it out to be.

Insult me all you wish,but that wont get you anywhere."
,damaro1,2012-08-22T15:24Z,"Not that I never get my hands dirty, (I used to just buy games and take them back if I didn't like them.) But If I enjoy something for more than a few hours I have no problem supporting the company that made it. And its the smaller companies like this that actually need it. And they usually can't afford to waste time and resources on DRM and such methods to prevent pirating. Unlike the big guys who want to pinch every penny they can from us."
,Stokenoff,2012-08-22T15:58Z,"Enough bickering - let's discuss this game - so my question is;
What DLC content is included in this d/l? - from the comments I take it that it should include the main game Dungeons of Dredmor plus the DLC expansion packs, Realm of the Diggle Gods, and You Have To Name The Expansion Pack, BUT doesn't include Conquest of the Wizardlands...
Is this correct??
(and if so does anyone know where you can snag the C of the W DLC?)"
,jikavak,2012-08-22T16:06Z,"I am actually planning to get this game once I get my payment things sorted.It's really cheap,like the negro guy said,and Gaslamp's blog posts are entaining to read too."
,jikavak,2012-08-22T16:07Z,"And yeah,that's correct,and there's no way to get the Wizardlands thing yet."
,OmniNegro,2012-08-22T16:11Z,"@damero1 It will still be available for purchase when you decide if you want to support it or not. In the meantime, enjoy it.

In reality, Gaslamp Games has publicly stated they do not believe in DRM anyway. They would not use it if it was given to them free of charge.

Pay no attention to my little argument with jikavak the troll. I do not care that he steals the game, but he is in outright denial that it is stealing. Oh well.

If I could bring that horse to water, I would have to drown him for the other horses sake."
,OmniNegro,2012-08-22T16:13Z,"@jakavak... Only after I post another message against you do I see that you are committing to buy the game when able. Sad. Forget everything I said. I apologize.

(TPB has comment issues at times...)"
