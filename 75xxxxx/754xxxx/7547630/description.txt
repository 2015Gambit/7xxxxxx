Slenderman's Shadow is based off indie game 'Slender' by Mark J. Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must complete the objective while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment. Enjoy!
