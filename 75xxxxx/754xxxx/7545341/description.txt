Pocket Planets is the largest 3D Solar System Simulator in the Google Play Store.
With scaled representation of the Sun, Planets, Moons, Asteroids, Dwarfs and detailed information to the celestial objects.
Regardless if you are a beginner or advanced astronomer, this App brings you closer to the planets than any telescope.

Discover ...

    the Sun, the bright shining star in the center of our Solar System
    Mercury, the fastest planet orbiting around our Sun
    Venus, its greenhouse effect produces a surface temperature that would even bring lead to melting
    Earth, the blue oasis and only place filled with life
    Mars, inspiration for many SciFi films and books
    Jupiter, the giant, guardian and protector in our neighborhood
    Saturn, with rings of unique beauty and elegance
    Uranus, which rolls over its orbit like a bowling ball
    Neptune, the outermost recognized planet
    Pluto, one of a new category of dwarf planets

But these are not all objects of this simulator, because so far you do not know Orcus, Varuna, Ceres, Pallas, Haumea and all the other asteroids and dwarf planets. Not to mention Sedna whose orbit is still speculative to science.

Nearly 200 objects are included in this simulator, but not as static images, rather as living objects in a living universe. Enjoy the Solar System in realtime, in the future or past.
