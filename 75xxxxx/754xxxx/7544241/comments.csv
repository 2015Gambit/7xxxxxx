also the filename shows that it is a useless dupe of a win8 torrent, posted here multiple times before"

,xpmule,2012-08-18T18:31Z,"oooook then lol

if your claiming to be the original leaker and then creating a new torrent you are basicly giving away your IP adddress to all authorities. And i bet they would love to nailthe windows 8 leakers to a cross so.. dumb idea

and if not your just being plain weird buddy.
Do you have any clue how many windows 8 rtm torrents get uploaded hourly ?
Do you really think the world needs 1 more ?

If it was already uploaded the one one one will be fast and this will be slow.
So yeah uhh whatever lol"
