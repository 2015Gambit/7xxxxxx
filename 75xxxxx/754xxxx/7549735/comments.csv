,JamJulLison,2012-08-20T15:54Z,"First let me say thank you for this.  I am watching it now.  I did notice something though, the quality doesn't look like HD.  It looks like SD and not exactly dvd grade either.  The resolution of this is 640x370.   That is less then the typical DVD resolution, which is 720x480 NTSC. Or for PAL 720x576.   720p is 1280x720.  Even without watching any of it I could tell it wasn't HD.  Watching some of it I can see it clearly isn't.  That said it still isn't bad. It could be a lot worse. It is frustrating though when someone says something is HD and it isn't. I do appreciate what you did though.  "
