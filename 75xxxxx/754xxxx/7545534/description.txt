Kung Pow! Enter the Fist is an American comedy film that parodies Hong Kong action cinema Kung Faux. Starring Steve Oedekerk, it uses footage from the 1976 Hong Kong martial arts movie Tiger and Crane Fist (a.k.a. Savage Killers), along with new footage shot by Oedekerk, to create an original, unrelated plot.
