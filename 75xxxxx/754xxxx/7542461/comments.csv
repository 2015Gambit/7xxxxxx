Thanks dellefs0.

I may have already asked this but do you think you could shrink this version of ""Andrei Rublev"" down to a  decent size? 19GiB is just too big. I'm sure I'm not the only fan of this film. There ought to be a big demand out there, if only people didn't have to use so much hard drive space.
