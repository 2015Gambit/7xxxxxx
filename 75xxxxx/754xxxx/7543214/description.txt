As with all Rifftrax movies if you want the original theatrical, or DVD version's of this movie then this is not the torrent you are looking for...

Hey, you know what happens if you hit play on Pink FloydΓÇÖs Dark Side of the Moon and Transformers: Dark of the Moon at the same time? We tried it, turns out they donΓÇÖt sync at all and the Pink Floyd album will immediately set itself on fire in protest (who knew mp3s could burn?). So instead you should probably sync it with the RiffTrax, as that is officially the only way to watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon without ending up in a fetal position, weeping at the horror of its brave new world.

ItΓÇÖs hard to believe the franchise soldiered on after the loss of its most beloved character, Megan FoxΓÇÖs butt. Yet somehow Michael Bay boldly moved forward with a new rich & complex female character, who ALSO has a butt, which happens to be the very first part of her shown in the film! And donΓÇÖt worry, all your other favorite characters are back, including: Noise! Chaos! Stuttering Shia! Racism! Screaming Shia! Respected actors shaming themselves for vacation house money! Stuttering WHILE Screaming Shia! The Matrix of Leadership! The coma induced by your laughter at the fact that they want you to take something called ΓÇ£The Matrix of LeadershipΓÇ¥ seriously!

Join Mike, Kevin and Bill as they take on Transformers: Dark of the Moon because itΓÇÖs simply not safe to watch this movie alone.
