[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-20T15:29Z,"Super1313, I've already answered that question when you asked me it in my ""Gateway Worship Discography"" thread yesterday. I have already torrented Attaboy and it's not my fault there are no seeders."
,E4Etorrent,2012-08-21T00:21Z,"Hey TorrentTracts. Thank you so much for all these torrents you've uploaded. They've been a blessing. Could u like look in2 uploading like the dvd live recordings or even music videos, e.g. Jesus At the Center - Israel Houghton. And do you have Aaron Lindsey's personal record? If so could u upload it? Thanks..."
,super1313,2012-08-22T05:44Z,ok sorry I didnt see your reply. thanks
,Weston0175,2012-08-22T23:47Z,"Torrent Tracts, do you have anything by the band Emery?
Thanks, Weston 0175"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-23T14:16Z,"E4Etorrent, unfortunately I don't collect videos.  As for Aaron Lindsey, I knew he was a producer, but I didn't know that he released his own music until you mentioned it, and I further looked into it.  Unfortunately I don't have it either, nor can I find it at this time.  But I'll be sure to keep a look out for it.  :)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-08-23T14:18Z,"Weston0175, Emery right?  They sounds familiar to me, so you might be in luck.  I don't have access to my music right now, but I'll be sure to look into it for you as soon as I get a chance.  :)"
,Weston0175,2012-08-23T19:07Z,"Si, senor. ""Emery"" I believe they've released about 12 or 13 albums so far."
