,pjones452,2012-08-20T09:28Z,whats a dvd rip 720p?
,shaaani,2012-08-20T12:30Z,@pjones452 looks like :)
,shaaani,2012-08-20T13:06Z,"as far as sample is concerned, its the best rip out thr also 720p dvdrip :)"
,saint84,2012-08-20T13:26Z,"can't be dvdrip. only hdrip . from the info, has to be high def . unless the info are wrong "
,Mobile264,2012-08-20T14:18Z,"A 720p DVDRip doesn't make sense *at all*, for the same reason taking a 100x100 picture and upscaling it to 1000x1000 won't make it look any better."
,Mobile264,2012-08-20T14:31Z,"My comment was deleted, but if you know how to encode at all you know that upscaling DVD resolution to 720p makes no sense. Uploader, it only makes you look stupid."
,sherrypizza,2012-08-20T14:57Z,"Well its not 720, that's for sure."
,CCWGGuy,2012-08-20T15:27Z,"Yeah the sample pics are large, but seeing as there are slightly blurry it is not an HD rip.  Its like making a DVD full screen, makes the picture larger, but not clearer."
,Redundantos,2012-08-20T16:12Z,720p my ass. This is DVD upscale.
,shaaani,2012-08-20T16:41Z,"i have seen sample of NYDIC and MAX, but this is the best, less blurry"
,dapratsta,2012-08-20T18:01Z,"720p DVDrip? Rubbish, it'd actually look better if you just got a normal (576p max) DVDrip and upscaled it on your player/TV"
,Oblivilot,2012-08-20T19:40Z,"Looks great! Took a while to finish d/l. Comparing this to the NYCDIC version, this is better on an HD screen attached to a PC capable of doing full HD1080p. This one is definitely sharper - not sure where it sits in the realm of things being 720p or not, but it's good enough for ~now!~"
,eliassos,2012-08-20T21:00Z,"It's the best upscale you can possible find for now.

Thank you uploader, I'll seed for a little while now

Movie 9
Audio 8
video 7"
,link5a,2012-08-20T21:20Z,"Very nice job Amir! It definitely looks better than my 720x384 copy with higher bitrate (same AVC video codec). Thanks for sharing!
I just finished downloading it and decided to stop seeding immediately, though after over 32GB uploaded I’m not sure if it would count as a hit and run ;)

@shaaani, @Oblivilot & @eliassos  I agree :)

@Mobile264 This 'stupid looking like uploader' has to my knowledge a vast experience encoding Bollywood movies, a field where is very difficult to find Blu-Ray sources, so they often have to upscale DVDs. I think you should probably be thankful for him using some expertise on this one. Now allow me to tell you that if I were to see a 100x100 picture in a 1000x1000 display I'd use PhotoZoom to do the upscaling as it does it way better than any viewer software (it has, indeed, more complex upscaling algorithms than Photoshop). But that’s just me; I always prefer the best viewing experience possible. If you don’t, then please consider the upscaling superiority of professional encoding software over players before you start deciding what makes sense or what doesn’t.

@dapratsta You sure about that? Please try it before stating it. I’ve explained about upscaling vs. player but now that’s something else… a TV? I mean, seriously? Unless your TV is running an Intel processor the best upscaling technology on a TV out there is Sony’s X-Reality Pro engine, and wouldn’t be sufficiently good against a video properly upscaled on a computer.

@Redundantos it’s stated in the description that the source is DVD, but thanks for figuring out the upscaling, genius!"
,sinful777,2012-08-20T22:44Z,"You bitches wine to much...should be thankful about it, otherwise just sit and wait on your ass till the real 720p or 1080p comes out.  In the mean time shut your holes peeps."
,GutlessNut,2012-08-20T23:42Z,DVDRip so not HD. Not worth downloading if you're picky haha
,topk,2012-08-21T01:58Z,">720p

STRETCHED"

,baba.mulon,2012-08-21T21:03Z,"LOL 720p DVDrip. :D This is actually a dvdrip upscaled. So it is a poor 480p rip. Bad quality even for 700mb, not to mention 2.6Gb. Thanks 4 the effort though!!"
,marquez010,2012-08-22T03:25Z,"Excellent copy V9, A9"
,Mullard37,2012-08-22T22:40Z,"Awful.  Sorry dude.  It's a good normal rip, but not highres.

I wish someone could get this junk out of the highres section...it is teeming with stuff like this!! AGH!!!
