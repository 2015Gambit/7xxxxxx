I have not seen a single seeder on the trackers or DHT, Peer Exchange etc.
(with or without PB running)"
,Thomachi,2012-08-19T00:29Z,Hi. I am so grateful that you upload this torrent. But maybe you forgot to start seed this one. Could you be so nice to check settings. I appreciate it. TNX for good uploads as always scenebalance
,xpmule,2012-08-19T01:45Z,"If you all wanna thank someone thank me ;)

i went and grabbed this somewhere else and i am now seeding it.
I got the video 100% done rar'd from upload.to and then extracted it to this torrent folder etc and forced a re-check torrent. strangely my client says the video is only 99.9% complete but that's bullshit the video IS done guaranteed, so that must have something to do with the piece counts used in the torrent itself..
So anyways.. download and watch !
Your welcome ;)"
,Thomachi,2012-08-19T01:55Z,"Oh, nice work xpmule. TNX alot, i love this show. didnt want to wait longer. so tnx m8"
,xpmule,2012-08-19T03:26Z,"for sure no problem happy to help :)

just bear in mind guys that the torrent is telling me its only 99.9% complete.
But i swear to god the video is 100% complete so don't worry about that.
The reason it says that has to do with the chunk pieces and teh fact that i do NOT have the .nfo in this torrent. I got the 2 .txt files and added them but they showed up as 0% done lol

Anyway technical crap aside, as long as it plays in full from start to finish with out errors you will see what i am saying ;)"
,Thomachi,2012-08-19T04:39Z,"Ah, thats why i didnt get 100% Now im ready to watch it, Im so happy now, tnx alot!!!"
,xpmule,2012-08-19T04:52Z,can't see all comments.. making a new post
,maako,2012-08-19T11:35Z,"Yeah, where is that last 0.1%..?"
,veedmo,2012-08-19T14:00Z,"Looks like the seeder deleted the nelat-files before seeding them, and they were the last 0,1%. This is a bad way to share a torrent."
,veedmo,2012-08-19T14:04Z,"Damn, Sorry xpmule, i missed your effort. Thanx a bunch."
,drhank,2012-08-19T19:11Z,"xpmule, many thanks for your efforts.  You got us to 99.9% complete.  And yes, the video was complete.  You had the right idea, but without the NFO file, the two scenetime files didn't propogate.  I got those two files from an earlier scenetime Chasing UFOs torrent, but got the NFO from a TorrentDay torrent and did a recheck on it to ensure everything was complete.  I copied the files to this torrent, did a recheck, got everything 100% complete and started seeding.  This got all the 99.9% peers complete and now there are many seeders.  A similar problem occurred on another scenetime torrent.  A tip of the hat to err001 on how he fixed that one.  It really is best for everyone to be able to get their client to show that their torrent is 100% complete, as it precludes uncertainty and doubt."
,xpmule,2012-08-19T22:17Z,"right on good job !!

i couldn't find the .nfo so i had no way of doing that :(

Sadly this uploader has had many issues like this where he doesn't seed his upload. it if SO many people are started the torrent I'd rather try and get that guys fixed and running rather than starting another torrent (the easy solution)

In case people don't know ?
You should always be able to get the file that is inside a torrent from anywhere and simply make sure the file name matches and then use your torrent client to check the torrent and then it should start seeding etc. The files have to be a flawless perfect match though or that will not work ;)"
