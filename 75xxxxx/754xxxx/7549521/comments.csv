,garfiel,2012-08-22T02:29Z,"Sorry got them from a newsgroup, where you pay a monthly fee.  If you have a newsgroup then you can search for them.

Newsgroups are not torrents, goggle it for more information.

There are only 13 English episodes and 2 extras.  Tried putting 2 more up yesterday and pirate bay just sat there not going anywhere.  Will just shove them all up in a couple of files if uploads want to work today."
