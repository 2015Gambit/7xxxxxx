A city in ruins. It may be the end of a war, or the end of an era. A group of survivors gets together to try to escape. There's Rey, a skeptical business man fallen into disgrace. El mudo, who has chosen not to speak, but who keeps for himself the secrets of music. Berry, an indian looking man who lives in a church dome, and carries the last traces of a long lost romanticism. Cielo, a paranoid and amoral teenager who worships Rey. Monito, an abandoned child in the search for love. And Brian, a kid still innocent after his parents' slaughter. These characters begin a journey that will face them to their own fears, dreams and longings, in their quest for salvation across the Fijman River.
