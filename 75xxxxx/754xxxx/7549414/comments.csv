,killbat,2012-08-20T05:58Z,yes thank you very much we already pay to much for cable why do they think they can be so money hungry as to make us pay for HBO also.
,syrielmorane,2012-08-20T06:21Z,Seed please
,reconomgwtfbbq,2012-08-20T06:25Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEED FFS!!!!
,t.a.,2012-08-20T06:35Z,"@killbat: that's an incredibly stupid thing to say. Incredibly. HBO is not a non-profit organization, it's operates a business that, like all other, needs to make a profit. I assume you buy the clothes you are wearing? Do you call those brands/companies ""money hungry"". It's just the nature of business. 

And FYI - I actually do pay for HBO, and I think it's worth every cent. But I just happen to be abroad at the moment and wanted to download the latest episode so I can watch it on the plane. "

Thanks for upload!

@t.a I know a lot of people can be opinionated on here but I think that @killbat didn't really mean to offend anyone.  I understand that even though I am not rich nor poor that it is actually hard to make mends meet, at times. Pirate bay allows us to watch what we cannot afford in our life due to whatever obstacle it might be. On our to do list, priority is bills that come first always & entertainment last unfortunately.  If I could personally afford to buy half the movies or hbo (in australia we have foxtel and it shows much later than most places) then yes we wouldn't have to rely on websites like this nor the other countless of other people that do as well.  If my partner wasn't an IT Guru then we wouldn't have the internet either. Look just sticking up for the less fortunate is all."
,YOSSI2010,2012-08-20T15:06Z,"@t.a. the problem is not the bussiness..
the problem is that we can't have HBO without having full cable TV...

i don't care zbout the other shows i wanna see what i want to and when i want to and on the device i want to....
saddly we don't have google play in israel and itunes is shit(and doesn't even have subtitles)
torrents get subs from  bs payer the same day the episode is out!(and even in hebrew a few days later)

when i'll have a comfortable service provider that is as comfy and as good as torrents i'll buy my episodes..."

,zeeer0,2012-08-21T21:48Z,"Thx 4d uploadz..
I wish I didnt have to pay for cable also. I dont like hbo, but I love me some true blood. I know they are the same company but I could do with out all the extras. (other crappy shows I don't watch, subscription to stupid vision Ill never use.) I got me a season 1 box set and tshirt, used to have a hat too(dog got to it) I feel Ive done enough. I wish a company would just say ""we arnt going to sue for sharing our show, but if you watched it at someone elses house or downloaded it from the internet, or whateva, please visit our donate page at www.hbo.com/trueblood/thanks.htttttl"" Would you donate if it was like that?"

,firexninja,2012-08-22T18:54Z,thank you!
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-08-23T03:29Z,"Wow, the comments about HBO are really kind of silly. Sure, times are tough economically. Sure, not everyone can afford HBO. But to say that HBO, which is not supported by advertising, should not charge is pretty silly. There are many reasons people download the episodes, and I'm making no judgment about that. Instead, I'm just pointing out that HBO provides a service that isn't financed like non-premium channels (that is, with a bunch of advertising)."
,musartemis,2012-08-24T12:28Z,"OMG!!!! Bill is so crazy!!!!!!
