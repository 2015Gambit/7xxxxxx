Melting Pot Records has been going since 2005. Since then we have constantly strived to release some of the freshest music from confirmed artists aswell as upcoming talent on our main label and different offshoots. The Melting Pot Chronicles Part 1 is a retrospective of some of the tunes that have shaped the sound of our imprint. A chance to rediscover forgotten gems for some or the occasion to catch up on some timeless neurofunk for those who missed out first time round.
