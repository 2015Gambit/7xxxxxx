PowerISO - the program allows you to create, convert, extract, compress, edit and encrypt images of CD / DVD, and open them using the built-in emulator. In PowerISO used compression-decompression technology in real-time image files with the extension of DAA, which significantly reduces the size of image files. Files Images can be cut into pieces of various sizes and in a compressed form to send through e-mail programs or write to other media. Most importantly - files can be used directly without decompressing. It works with all major formats of images: ISO, BIN, NRG, CDI, DAA, MDF, BWI, B5I, LCD, CIF, P01, PDI, NCD, PXI, GI, FCD, VCD, C2D. There is a built-in emulator CD / DVD-drive.
