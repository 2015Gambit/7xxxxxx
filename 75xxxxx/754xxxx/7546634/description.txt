Gracian was a 17th century (1601-1658) Jesuit monk, and sometimes you can see religion reflected in his writings. 

This work gives advice and guidance on how to live more fully, advance socially, and be a better person. Some of the material here may seem disagreeable. 

We advise that Gracian's writings be taken with lots of contemplation, it might help to absorb the material slowly and then explore it further.
