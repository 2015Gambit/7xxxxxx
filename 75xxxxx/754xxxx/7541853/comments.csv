,Hancock79,2012-08-18T09:58Z,"why do you need 3gb ram to play this?  i'm playing a different release on 2gb ram just fine on Win7 64bit.  is it how you cracked it or what, and is that why it's so small?  what's ripped?

not saying this is fake you've clearly uploaded stuff that works before, I'm just curious"

About size - nothing ripped ,just highly compressed"
