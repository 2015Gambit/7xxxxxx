[T],iamgreat,2012-08-20T00:27Z,"ryan_8374, look closer. ""Doctor Who Best Of Specials"" is the show.  It is on iTunes and Amazon. This IS the third episode of season two of Doctor Who Best Of Specials. 

Season 1
The Best Of The Doctor
The Best Of the Monsters
The Best Of The Companions
The Best Of The Christmas Specials

Season 2 
The Science Of Doctor Who
The Women Of Doctor Who
The Time-Wimey Of Doctor Who
The Destinations Of Doctor Who
and likely another episode around Christmas 2012

Enjoy the show. "
,ryan_8374,2012-08-20T01:13Z,"That's simply a way for itunes and amazon to group them together. BBC America didn't plan them as a series and no one else I know of considers them as such. Zap2it lists them individually, as does thetvdb.com (http://thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=78804&seasonid=26260&lid=7)"
[T],iamgreat,2012-08-20T11:00Z,"zap2it = 3rd party directory that can be horribly inaccurate, especially with non-American shows. 

thetvdb = 3rd party, user-contributed database. Ditto for TVRage and Wikipedia. 

It isn't iTunes or Amazon that would decide HOW to package the show for sale but BBCA or/and BBC in this case.  The companies do have encoding standards that must be met but packaging of content for sale is up to the rights owner. 

If you big complaint is that i am not calling them a non-collection of one-off specials like most everyone else then damn me for actually looking into it first. What a crazy idea to actually look to a non-user-submitted-content source for information. Feel free to complain when i put out s2e4 next week or if i upload s1 three days from now. Or you can just enjoy the show. "
