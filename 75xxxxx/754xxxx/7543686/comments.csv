[V],psspss,2012-08-19T16:00Z,"yeh

scene wont upload anything to p2p if its not HD now

not even to fill a missed episode

in fact scene download like p2p and dont share to it.. instead I think they share on secret servers or directlinks the stuff.. and news channels

its US  torrentMULES that take the risk uploading .. so mpa comes after the uploaders
it wont have any impact as theyll get the wrong people"
[V],psspss,2012-08-19T16:01Z,i mean scene dont like p2p
