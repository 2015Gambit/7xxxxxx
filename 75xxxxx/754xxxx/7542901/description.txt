As one of the most important and innovative figures in modern popular music, Osbourne Ruddock aka King Tubby almost single-handedly invented and pioneered the style known as Dub.

Using basic equipment in his small home studio in West Kingston, he created electrifying and often wildly avant garde remixes that redefined the role of the recording engineer during the mid Seventies. Collected on this set are 20 of his hardest Dub tracks from the golden era of the genre ΓÇô the mid to late seventies, with contributions from some of ReggaeΓÇÖs most celebrated talents including Dennis Brown, Horace Andy & Augustus Pablo.
