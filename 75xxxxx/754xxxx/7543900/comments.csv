It has crackling sound and you can clearly hear it on quiet scenes. Video is good, for a DVDRip. So much better than CAMRips.

A:4/10 - have to turn volume to max to hear people speak, but that's not a good idea, since when action occurs, then audio is restored / +200ml db audio gain = speakers and ears break. 
I hate when encoders fuck with audio. Most newest movies are all ruined. Seriously, fuck you.
A cinema effect you say? Yea right! Action audio ""hits the peak wall"" - sound becomes garbled and on older, already broken speakers, you will hear crackling instead. Fucking dipshits.
At least then include english subtitles with the video. But not such subtitles where every sound effect like ""wind blows"", ""fart"" and ""cat meows"" is also included, it's just stupid."
,Amiante_,2012-08-21T17:51Z,"@skulldragon: Thanks for explaining the frustration that has been annoying me for almost every video.  If only there were some tool I could use to normalize the sound.

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that way, way too much dialog is whispered these days, as if the filmmakers are going out of their way to make it impossible to enjoy the movie outside of a theater.  But yeah subtitles would be fine for that."

It's not good quality fuzzy when on a big screen. Even full screen on my 23 inch monitor is fuzzy. The audio has little cracks and pops. Also no subtitles at all for when they are speaking a different language. Like okay here is a 3 minute scene within the first 10 or so minutes where you can't understand a word of it. I then see another scene after in another language and just deleted it. I would deal with poor audio and video, but cmon no subs at all? I don't know how many scenes are in another language but it caused a decent barrier for me."

If you don't belong to any of these three categories, don't waste your time on this movie. Really. My yesterday's evenign was totally ruined by this dull and empty movie."

it sucks to have them on all the time though, so make sure you have a hotkey or something for turning subs on/off quickly.

,AlexLibman,2012-09-01T08:06Z,"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/07/14/Whedon-Goes-On-Anti-Capitalist-Rant

So the director of this movie, Joss Whedon, turns out to be a total socialist idiot! (Or at least a self-serving liar who knows that the majority of the movie-going mob are jealous economically-illiterate idiots, and tries to gain their favor in spite of the fortune he is making.) This is a big stab in the back, in particular to all those libertarians who liked Firefly / Serenity...

This is exactly why I'd wait even an extra year to pirate almost anything that Hollywood produces, rather than see it in theaters. If pirating cost me 100x more, then I would pay 100x more, knowing that the money isn't going to those socialist scumbags who are completely detached from economic reality and are using their media power to fuck up the world!

Read real economists - it is socialism that is destroying itself right now, and free market capitalism is the answer! Real free market capitalism respects the real Natural Rights to life, liberty, property - not the socialist construct of intellectual monopolies backed by the state!"
