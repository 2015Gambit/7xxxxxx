,CCnOSnBT,2012-08-18T20:01Z,cause some ISPs block the tor website
,ClubQBall,2012-08-19T03:39Z,"Instead of saying, ""WHY?"" ... why not just say ""THANK YOU!"" and be own your way?  

You have a pink skull & crossbones by your name ... why not trying showing others what it means?

Thank you CCnOSnBT ...my ISP also blocked the Tor website so I depend on your torrent!

Same for Skype in the middle east countries, it is blocked for the Skype download ULR...
