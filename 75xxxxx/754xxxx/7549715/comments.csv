,michaelrwatson,2012-08-22T01:42Z,"Quality??  Or is this another fake one? I would not expect TvTeam to upload fakes, but then why no useful comments..?"
,michaelrwatson,2012-08-22T01:44Z,"In any event, PLEASE create MP4 instead of MKV. Mkv sucks balls. Thanks."
,michaelrwatson,2012-08-23T10:58Z,"Well, this is real. A9, v7 (on cam scale)

Video has minimal or no flicker but is overcropped and there are no English subs for the foreign parts, but very watchable. 

No point in downloading one of the 1.4GB versions or even 700MB, that's for sure. Unfortunately, it's a pretty bad movie.

512forU, how about some more of these, but in MP4 package? You can squeeze good Q into 400MB if you know what your doin. Thx."
