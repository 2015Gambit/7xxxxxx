,CentiHz,2012-08-20T08:59Z,320kbps of a 128kbps stream?
,wildkat16,2012-08-20T09:17Z,"Yes, sorry, it is just a re-encode of the stream. I did go to the effort of splitting it up into separate tracks and adding all of the correct ID3 tags though. I also pre-ordered a CD copy and I will try to upload that in true 320kpbs and FLAC as soon as I can."
,FRDS,2012-08-27T10:31Z,What's the point of this? A reencode of an already-lossy file will sound even worse. Very misleading.
,katranj,2012-08-27T14:46Z,"Still downloading to hear what this sounds like... Will wait for better uploads!

Thanks!!!"
,nondoleo,2012-09-02T00:23Z,"I can't sense much loss in the tracks, it sounds pretty good.  Thanks."
,wildkat16,2012-09-05T00:21Z,"As promised, here is the official retail version ripped in true 320kbps MP3 and FLAC: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7600658
I strongly recommend downloading this release instead. Enjoy and please seed!"
