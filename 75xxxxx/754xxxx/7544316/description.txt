There were several sixties bands named Group Therapy, but this was likely the Northeastern variant featuring vocalist Ray Kennedy (who worked with the Beach Boys and Mike Bloomfield in the 1970s).Both albums (recorded in 1967-69) of the U.S. formation almost directly referring to the creativity and style Vanilla Fudge - a lot of modifications to the luscious sound of Hammond organs and rich vocal harmonies in the foreground....RCA's answer to Vanilla Fudge... They even cover "People Get Ready" just like the Fudge...
There music was of the heavy Vanilla Fudge variety, and not apparently memorable. Playing mostly originals, but also a few standards, opening up with Hendrix "Foxy Lady" among others. A nice guitar driven platter from the 60's
