I know this is probably not supported anymore, but I have some concerns:

The package installs fine, as far as I can tell using my meager martian language skillz,
but none of the games are playable.

Launching hl.exe displays a horrible ugly TigerHeart ""intro"" vid accompanied by an equally horrible distorted clipped soundtrack, followed by the usual Sierra and Valve intro vids.

After this, instead of seeing the expected classic game menu, I either get a black screen or a few frames of the menu before a total crash.

I'm running win7 home premium 64bit, and none of the compatability options has any effect.

I'd rather not sit through that shitty loud pixel-rape intro again just to crash out, any solution is appreciated!"

,zerohouse,2012-09-14T01:25Z,"Thanks, drake_1, that got rid of the intros.

The game still instantly and silently crashes immedately, I see a second of the HL background image and no menu and then the game process exits with no error message.

I've tried adding a DEP exception, and I've tried various HL launch parameters ( -gl or -d3d, -window, etc ) to no avail.
Windows compatability options do nothing.

Has anyone played this release on win7 64bit?"
,drake_1,2012-09-14T16:57Z,I tested it only on XP SP3 and Win7 32-bit.
