Having a dilemma here - purity vs practicality.
It would seem that while AVI can handle AAC quite well,
it doesn't report it quite correctly. Notably (at least some
versions of) VLC doesn't detect the audio track well at all.
Media Player Classic has no problem whatsoever.
The practical says - convert the audio to MP3, since AVI
doesn't do AAC well. But then I'd have to create a moniker
and take credit for actually doing something here.
But MP3 is somewhat standard for AVI, so why not?
Create an external MP3 audio file with instructions on use?

Search TPB for "Chelsea.Lately.2012.08.15" and see what it's like.
AVI - X264 / AAC encoding with a separate MP3 audio track.

Any thoughts?
Yes, there IS a short pier here ... why?
