Khaliah, daughter of Mohammad Ali, struggled with obesity for most of her life.

With a father famous for his athletic abilities (and one sister following in hi
s footsteps) Khaliah felt insecure about her weight. She tried many diets and weight-loss programs, but hunger always got the best of her. At her heaviest, she reached 325 pounds, and even with diet and exercise couldn't seem to get below 220. Khaliah decided to try laparoscopic bandingΓÇöa surgery this book claims has less risk, less recovery time and better results than gastric bypass. With the help of the band (which is wrapped around the stomach), Khaliah was finally able to lose the weight and step out of her shell. Khaliah is a likable person on the page; she seems to genuinely want to help others get results. The sections written by her doctors explain the mechanics of the surgery, who should or should not have it and what to expect if you do. The audience of the book is clearly limited to those curious about the surgery or at least in the market for a way to lose a large amount of weight.
