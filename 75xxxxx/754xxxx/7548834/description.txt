An underappreciated set from the Messengers.


Source Provenance: Analog recording 1964...released as CD in 1987..ripped via EAC/WAV


Wayne Shorter really COOKS here......his recordings with Blakey might be better than 

his own records as leader later on...youthful exuberance perhaps


ALL music is analog......digital technology lets us copy it without the problems 

inherent with magnetic tape.....NOISE...generation loss


I try to upload obscure or historically important recordings from my collection which


may not be available elsewhere as FLAC



OPEN YOUR EARS.......dig in
