RELEASE NOTES

Four Expendables (Barney, Gunner, Caesar and Yin Yang) are hired to
rescue an extremely valuable kidnapped Chinese billionaire. It's
business as usual until all hell breaks loose and the explosive mix of
testosterone and kerosene detonates. The result is a massive fireball
that never lets up, with the relentless action concluding where the
new movie begins.

The Expendables 2 videogame is a way for fans to experience all of
their favourite explosive moments, as their favourite stars, in
four-player co-op action.
