Before The French revolution came along and spoiled their fun, the rich aristocrats spent most of their time indulging in the pleasures of the flesh- on a grand scale. Huge Banquets would be laid out out for the so-called "ladies and gentlemen" of the court- with the main course being an orgy of unbridled debauchery. Shot entirely on film by Europ's acclaimed director Joe D'Amato, ANAL PALACE, is a lavish period production tha tlives up to its portrayal of the "beautiful people" and their pursuit of pleasure in every possible form. Shot on location in Europe with an all-star cast from America and abroad, this beautiful, sensual, and provocative film celebrates the art of making love- with a decidedly kinky twist.
