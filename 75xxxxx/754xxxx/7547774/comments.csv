,zackqx301,2012-08-21T10:26Z,"My whole com freezes sometime when Im playing it, did any1 experience it? Or is it just me."
,cdaperu,2012-08-22T05:39Z,"Sorry think its just you. I play this all day, and host a MapleStory server and it works great."
,cdaperu,2012-08-22T05:40Z,are you using mountain lion? if so you might wanna google xquartz and install it. Even so without it you should be fine.
,zackqx301,2012-08-22T07:07Z,@cdaperu Im using Snow Leopard.
,Kniteed,2012-08-22T10:15Z,extremely buggy. Sophos detected a virus. Not worth it.
,cdaperu,2012-08-25T08:04Z," Ignore taht asshole, heres the REAL feedback

 FUCK YOU. "
,cdaperu,2012-08-25T08:05Z,"Seriously? im a windows porter. This port is great. any bugs are from the private server. As far as the PORT goes this is 100%. If you dont like the private server you can replace the exe. Youre full of crap wtf was a virus in there? its just wineskin, official maplestory v62 and a client to connect to the private server. What the hell are you talking about i've been playing this for days. Im pirate level 13 my username is colemancda on channel 1, the only bug is that when you buy form the cash shop you have to close eteh app and log back in, but thats a private server issue not my wrapper.

"
,ClayMan812,2012-09-01T02:45Z,Doesn't even open and update what wrappers? why the fuck isn't that already included. 
,Kniteed,2012-09-02T03:33Z,"I never said there was a virus, I said Sophos detected a virus. It was probably wrong, yeah, but I'm just saying."
