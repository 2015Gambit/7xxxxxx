,roumor2,2012-08-20T00:34Z,it works but in all the cutscenes model of the main chatacter and some other models are invisible. Also there's like 1 min black screen before each cutscene even if it happens right where you are with all the environment already loaded.
,roumor2,2012-08-20T00:37Z,"language is English. lots of bugs though.
in the very beggining when you chase after some guy and he suddenly stops just leave him. Run into the door ahead and continue without him."

,yichun4,2012-08-20T00:59Z,"It works well,but the problem is that in cutscenes it has to load before every single one, and your characters are invisible, all the important characters, such as wei and jackie, but random people are there such as the police officers when you get arrested at the beginning, im going to try and reinstall to see if that will fix the problem"

So if it not works for you, you have a crap computer. Cause laptops are not good to play games normaly. So i will probobly maybe have some problems later.

My specs on a Aspire 5742G:

,Motafota,2012-08-20T07:52Z,"@The4X3R- I downloaded and patched v1.4 which was suppose to fix it... It didn't.  There is a fix though. Goto the installation dir where you installed Sleeping Dogs > Data > DisplaySettings.xml Just edit that.

Could you please upload a separate torrent with only the sleeping dogs dlc's specifically the police protection.

I bought sleeping dogs from steam - so I didn't get the dlc :[

Thanks alot :]"
,ogood,2012-08-20T08:46Z,Game won't uninstall correctly either. I recommend that you download a different torrent.
,mrgooey00,2012-08-20T09:09Z,"Thanks.

I seem to be running to a problem though. There is a long wait between cutscenes, and main characters are invisible/missing

-i3 2020
-Gtx 560ti"
,nignug,2012-08-20T10:05Z,Great. Another console port that runs terrible even with the newest GPUs. The reason I don't buy games is because of all these games being released before they are done. Then they expect you to just try to enjoy the bug filled game while they take 2 more weeks to create a patch to fix it.
,mrgooey00,2012-08-20T10:13Z,"Ignore, what I said earlier about the invisible characters, I fixed it.

For People that are having the problem, where you can't see the main characters. Reinstall the game with HD Textures. That is how I got mine fixed.

,nignug,2012-08-20T14:28Z,also even if it appears that your computer can run this game it still might not be able to. a lot of people with top of the line PCs right now including me are having trouble getting over 30 fps. If you aren't even getting more than 20fps on lowest settings you  either need to upgrade or wait to see if SE releases more fixes.

For some reason on some computers the game does not want to run after installing. The game ran fine on my main computer but not the others. What was happening was that the game for some reason changed graphic settings. Texture resolution can be set to high not extreme on some of the computers and ambient occlusion has to be set to normal. When set to max settings on those two it seems that the game had problems with High resolution textures loading as I looked into the debug. Well, I hope this helps some of you. "

One problem, though: I can't change the advanced graphics setting. All the other menus work fine, including most of the basic graphics settings. The ""graphics level"" option, though, is stuck on ""undefined,"" and anything that I change in the advanced graphics menu refuses to save.

So I hit 'Q', go in, turn on the HD texture pack, hit 'E' to save my changes, but when I come back everything is still set to default.

Any ideas."

,RanY2jith,2012-08-25T01:59Z,"Okay now. Since it's the weekend, I almost have completed the game and I have found various fixes for various questions.

1. I do not see the character, just a floating briefcase - This is a problem with the game installed without ""HD Textures"", when installing, click the HD textures button and then install.

2. The game opens for a second and then closes without an error message - To fix this, download the crack from 3DM named as ""Sleeping.Dogs.New.Crack.Freeze.Fixed-3DM"". This will fix the problem with launching and works without any crash.

3. Mouse lag - Bad response input - There is no fix for this at the moment but as per my knowledge, it's because of the frames dropping in a useless way, to fix this, play the game on which you play smoothly. If your computer is a medium end, let it play that way. Though after 2-3 hours of gameplay, the mouse lag disappears no matter how bad it lags.

4. Various other input fixes - In the game menu and under controls, you should set the game input as Keyboard/Mouse from Auto Swap if you have a controller connected.

I hope this helped a few people. If you have any questions, post it here. Lets see how we can troubleshoot that. I downloaded this game it works like a charm after the crack fix from 3dm. Cheers!"
,bl8z3d,2012-08-25T02:12Z,hay well does that mean i have to reinstall it because if thats the case it wont let me uninstall i get this run time error.. but anyways is there a way to get HD textures without reinstalling

Right click & run as administrator, or to set that as the default action go to properties, compatibility tab then tick Always run as admin.

,zimos88,2012-08-31T17:05Z,any working dlcs for this release? I've tried the one that @diamond said it worked for some time but suddenly the game does not open
,Medi,2012-08-31T20:46Z,"Ok, finally SOLVED the problem launching the game. For those who try to open it and get a white screen for seconds OR nothing at all, here is the solution:

1. Right click on HKShip.exe, on ""compatibility"" tab check Win 98/ Win Me and check Run as Admin (bottom)

2. Double click on HKShip.exe, wait and the game will run.

3. Cntr+Alt+Supr and go to task manager. On the process tab, at the bottom, click ""see all process/all users""

4. Right click on the HKShip.exe process and go to ""set affinity"". Set affinity to All cores (if you don´t, the game will lag as hell)

5. Enjoy the game.

NOTE: Repeat the steps every time you play. 
This problem happened OFFICIALLY to many people on legit copies, running different OS. Mine is windows 7 64bit. Do not trust people who says your rig is shit. I am quite amazed how my old rig can handle it at a decent fps, obiously not everyting on high. 

Cheers"
,happy_ez_day,2012-09-01T00:36Z,lonelywolf90 the install files here are compressed (unlike the skidrow version...another reason why this one is better). if you look at the size of the installation directory it should be around 9.72gb (which is what mine is)...cheers!

If you try to close it or click on it it will just stop answering. I have tried this 8 times, and I even waited 30 min before doing anything with no response. I am really dissapointed."
,pukhtoon707,2012-09-01T21:53Z,"How to install with 1.5 update.

1 Download skidrow version of (Sleeping Dogs Limited Edition DLC RePack-VANSIK) from Heromaster(6.29GB). By default its 1.3 version,it will work without copying any crack if not thn just copy the crack but remember some people had issues with ver 1.3.

2 Download 3DMGame 1.4 update(1.7GB)

3 Dwonload 3DM 1.4 crack (6.35MB), Download update 1.5(36MB)

4 Install the game with HD textures enabled.

5 Copy and paste all content from 3DMGAME(1.7GB) into main game   directory.

6 Copy and paste every thing from update 1.4 to main game dir, you   may need to replace some files.Run update10to14,dont worry if it   gives you an error.

7 Copy and replace crack files from crack folder into game dir.
  When you run the game you will notice version 1.4 at the bottom of   the screen after the intro.
8 Now copy and replace ver 1.5 into main dir.

Some antivirus software might detect buddha.dll as a virus,just turn off your antivirus while downloading,block it afterwards.To prevent it from antivirus detection make a zip folder of update 1.5.

Unfortunatly HD textures doesnt work with ver 1.4 and ver 1.5, the default version is 1.3 you dont need to actually copy any crack it worked for me,HD textures also works fine with ver 1.3. To change the graphics setting 1st click save(Yes) and than no when it ask you again which will take you back to main menu.

This worked for me,hopefully this will solve your problem.

Thanks"

Instead of clicking away in the installer, its vital you read it, as if you dont, you will get bugs.

Comes with the HD textures. You MUST install this for  there to be less bugs.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7551450/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_MULTI_7_CRACKED_NEW_UPDATE_1.4

Sleeping Dogs has WAY too many different updates, cracks, patches, and fixes. This game is an absolute nightmare and I have been cracking games since I was 15. Here's my instructions to get 1.5 and DLC working.

1) Download this torrent game and install it with HD textures.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7551450/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_MULTI_7_CRACKED_NEW_UPDATE_1.4

2)Download this 1.4 update, copy in into the install directory and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547939/3DMGAME-Sleeping.dogs.v1.4.Update-3DM.7z

3)Copy over this 1.4 crack and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547614/Sleeping_Dogs_-_v1.4_-_3DM_Crack_Only

4) Download this 1.5 update and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7587843/Sleeping_Dogs_v1.4_to_v1.5_Update_%28_36_MB_%29 

Run the 1.4-1.5.bat file and ignore the errors.

5) To get DLC working download this torrent and copy to Sleeping Dogs folder and overwrite when asked.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7597494/Sleeping_Dogs_v1.5_Crack_with_All_DLC(Working)

6)Open LumaEmu.ini and replace the path for steam_api.dll with the current Sleeping Dogs path.

That's it! I did this exactly and the game launched with no issues!

I know the 1.5 update changes Game.big, but if you want HD textures this is the way to do it. I didn't have any issues so far with slowdown or FPS drops. I did this about 2 weeks ago, so I'm pretty sure those are all the files you need to transfer."
