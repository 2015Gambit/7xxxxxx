Then the other half of me says, errr, you've named them generically so I have no idea which file is which ( i01(41), for example) and I have to DL 27 gig to see who is who.

I'm not even asking for screenshots, but if I had the proper file with the girl's name, I go to the website myself to look up the ones that yank my crank.

So, umm, awesome DL, and I really do appreciate your efforts,  but 27 gig is just way to much for me to hope that it's the right files."

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 3 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
