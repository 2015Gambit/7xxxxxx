,dukeford57,2012-08-25T01:21Z,Would prefer an AVI or Mp4 file. Seems like the scene has gone to Mp4. I wish you uploaders would stick to one thing. Or let me know how to convert from mkv to mp4. Thanks for the effort though.

If you get free download of converterlite just google it,
its real easy to use can convert almost any file into avi, I use it a lot to make avi so I can put to dvd. Cheers"
