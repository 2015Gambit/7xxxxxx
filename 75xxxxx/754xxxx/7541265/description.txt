Windows 8 Enterprise X86 ( 32 bits ) RTM Build 9200 Vmware Image Created with Vmware Workstation 8.0

This image has been preinstalled Without Vmware tools. Actually You don't need to have the tools installed. 
Just open up the View>Autosize>Stretch Guest. And after that set the resolution if you are in Full Screen Mode.
Also Windows 8 is unactivated so 30 days to try. And no name has been inserted so that does mean you have to set a name for the pc. 
Like First Start up.
