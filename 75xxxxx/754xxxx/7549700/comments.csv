[V],gansuk,2012-08-20T08:14Z,includes hd texture pack
,belsel,2012-08-20T09:12Z,"Hi gansuk, have SPANISH subtitles?

Thank you, nice uplotad."
,Anroid869,2012-08-20T09:22Z,"That small and includes HD-textures, Wow!"
,GObonzo,2012-08-20T14:18Z,"so only packaging is compressed? not actual video, textures, audio quality?"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-08-20T14:44Z,Audio and textures are left untouched as they are. Only the videos (not many videos are there in game) are recoded to 50% quality. Nothing else.
,SandRunneR,2012-08-20T15:17Z,"Can someone confirm that this upload doesn't have the ""missing cutscenes"" issue like all the others?"
,kakajeet1,2012-08-20T15:20Z,"Is this game working without any Menu,Options,UI glitches and freezes ? Please can anyone confirm it and many thanks to Kaos group & Gansuk to upload it."
,Kronical4,2012-08-20T17:11Z,"Ouch 50% video quality lowered. Yeah thanks for the effort but I am going to wait on a 100% full game of sleeping dogs, no game is worth lowering your experiance for. "
,Call_of_duty,2012-08-20T18:18Z,I wanna know what the size of total videos are?
,Tobu91,2012-08-20T19:34Z,"This is a great upload, works without ANY problems whatsoever, and to those wondering about the video quality - I didn't even realize that they were lowered. Insall went smooth aswell, .exe did everything for you."
[T],PirateBoy,2012-08-20T20:13Z,"Install through the Install.exe or else extract the archives and run ~unpak.bat

By the way, those of you whining about the lowering of videos, you dont experience the videos as downgraded. they seem almost unchanged in game because this release contains the HD texture pack included. so, dont wrry about the videos :)

and, the game works fine. it has been tested and then released. as it contains the update 1.4 so all the glitches and freezes are solved.

Cheers
Happy Gaming :)"
,athosz17,2012-08-20T22:30Z,so there are no missing cutscenes? 
,genocide44,2012-08-20T22:30Z,does this game have fullscreen mode with no black bars
,drballto,2012-08-21T00:12Z,"I feel like I missed something here.  I followed the steps and even used the installer in the default directory, but I don't see any ""HKShip.exe"" in the games directory.  And when I try to use a crack from a different source it says I don't have bink32.dll.  What am I doing wrong here?"
,salmanbari86,2012-08-21T02:07Z,"@drballto
ur missing bink32.dll file so google it and download it and paste it in the main directory..."
,Gary_The_Goldfish,2012-08-21T02:23Z,"Gansuk,

Is it possible for you to upload a separate file with only the dlcs in it, for those people who actually bought the game from steam - but haven't got the limited edition dlcs?

Thanks"
,grim_reefer88,2012-08-21T02:39Z,awesome game. everything works for me except when i try to get in any vehicle the game crashes. if anybody can help me it would be much appreciated
,grim_reefer88,2012-08-21T02:45Z,"every time i get in any vehicle my game crashes. everything else works though, and the game looks amazing. if someone could help me that would be awesome."
,KROMORIN,2012-08-21T03:10Z,malwarebytes detected malware.packer.gen but MSE detected nothing.  May be a false positive. Detected at 2008 20aug2012 CST 
,KROMORIN,2012-08-21T03:19Z,"I posted that MBAM picked up Malware.packer.gen, but it seems my Post was deleted.  To clarify, Microsoft Security Essentials did not detect this, but the fact that this post was deleted is strange."
,rablaine,2012-08-21T03:37Z,"I downloaded and installed via installer.  It only registers as version 1.3 and doesn't retain changes in the graphics settings.  It plays full screen and doesn't seem to be skipping any cutscenes.  The game plays great and looks beautiful despite not being able to turn up AA, but no complaints from me!"
,rablaine,2012-08-21T03:39Z,"@KROMORIN
there are 2 posts regarding your MBAM detection, one 9 minutes before the other.  You might have been seeing a cached version of the page-it didn't get deleted, and just my $0.02, AVG didn't detect anything on my system."
,s1raz1,2012-08-21T15:49Z,"I downloaded it, and after it check upacks, there is a line about direct x not being internal command line along with vcredist and screen just stay there, is that normal?"
,Orukunak,2012-08-21T21:53Z,"Install goes smoothly, I start up the game without any problems but when I hit ""New Game"", it shows to the loading screen and the little dragon-thing manages to spin around 2-3 times before the game crashes every time. Any help would be appreciated."
,athosz17,2012-08-22T02:14Z,the best version of Sleeping dogs so far .... i i have played lots of missions and 2 bugs so far (small bugs) so its playble for me no missing cutscenes and options saving works too 
,athosz17,2012-08-22T02:16Z,options saving works but you must save the changes then it will ask you once again if you want to save it then click on NO and it will work
,theanxious,2012-08-22T06:48Z,"Why do i keep trying your rips i have no idea. At least 70% of your rips don't fucking work man. You are by far the worst ripper of games i have ever seen. I click the . exe to launch, game pops up in windowed mode with white screen for 2 seconds and disappears. KaOs you are a fuckin' waster!"
,Titley,2012-08-22T08:05Z,Is this a steam version?
,epic_seeder97,2012-08-22T08:11Z,"@theanxious 

u fucking son of a bitch kaos is by far the best repacking team. and the windows disappears maybe because u have not disabled UAC on windows. try disabling it"
,theanxious,2012-08-22T08:36Z,"Best ripper my ass. Of all the other rippers, their games work for me 99% of the time no issues at all. And OFC UAC is disabled. People who reply with disable UAC as a fix is a fuckin' retard with -10 IQ! "
,asch999,2012-08-22T09:10Z,"@theanxious

If KaoS previous release have failed you, why bother to keep downloading their release"
,pikachu89,2012-08-22T09:32Z,Is this one working?
,theanxious,2012-08-22T09:53Z,"Because sometimes they do actually work. Believe me, if any other rippers had it up sooner i would have grabbed theirs."
[V],gansuk,2012-08-22T12:53Z,lol
,KROMORIN,2012-08-22T13:28Z,"Game Works 100%, MBAB did in fact detect a trojan and cleared it, didn't affect the gameplay at all.  MSE still missed it.  No big deal.  This is the reason you DL for free, and you understand the risk in doing so.  If you don't want viruses go buy the damn game. LOL!!  Otherwise no issues at all with this poster or the title posted.  Great Upload, thanks man!!!"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-08-22T13:57Z,"@ theanxious

If you dont like KaOs and there's no other release toher than KaOs, then just go buy the game. By the way, the game works fine. If not, upgrade your PC.

If you dont like us, just dont comment here...thats all!"
,rokx_raffy11,2012-08-22T14:19Z,"Please can someone tell me if this game runs on WIN XP or not ??? B/c my pc meets the min system requirements of the game but still i'm unable to play the game which i think is due to absent of WIN 7 on my pc !!!
Please someone help !!! "
,theanxious,2012-08-22T14:41Z,"@ pirateboy I have a high end Evga 680 sli rig tyvm. So again your one of those with -10 IQ with your retarded reply. And i comment here to let people know this rip sucks. That's what the comments are for.

@ rokx NO, this will not work on XP either. You really shouldn't be still running xp anyway. Grab win 7 here on TPB lol."
,Titley,2012-08-22T16:23Z,Can SOMEONE tell me if this is a steam version or not? 
,epic_seeder97,2012-08-22T18:46Z,"@theanxious

u fucking moron just fuck off and like everyone said if u dont like dont download their releases no one has forced u STOP spamming here by saying tht the game is not working. i have downloaded many kaos rips previously and all of them worked 100% for me "
,epic_seeder97,2012-08-22T18:49Z,@ the anxious  and abt ur fucking IQ it must be -100 to post such comments on this torrent thts y tld u to disable UAC i never said it was a fix u retard dumbfuck. 
,Ragecaiks,2012-08-22T19:49Z,"@theanxious
Hey fuckwit, ever think that your computer is just plain incompatible for the fucking game/torrent, no matter how high end? Every single Kaos torrent I have used works. It unpacks easily and runs perfectly fine. If you're going to come on here to bitch and complain because your one of the few people who are too retarded to get this torrent to work then go buy the fucking game, dipshit. If you wanna insult peoples IQ's then don't be a retard yourself."
[V],gansuk,2012-08-22T19:57Z,"as most comments say the game is working, it doesn't take a high iq to work out who has the low one."
,anongeek,2012-08-22T21:07Z,DX10 only so no XP
,WoYa,2012-08-22T22:29Z,"FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE WHITE SCREEN PROBLEM:Apparently it is because you don't have windows installed on the C: drive.

Here's the solution for it:

There is a way to run it if you have Windows is not on drive C:
Download the file that corresponds to your install location for Sleeping Dogs :

rghost(.)ru_/_39910276 if windows is in D:
rghost(.)ru _/_39910718 if windows is in E:
rghost(.)ru _/_39909929 if windows is in G:

Just extract and then copy the files in game directory. Found this guide somewhere, worked for me, just passing it along so people can solve their problem with the game."
,KoldPT,2012-08-22T23:17Z,"Hey guys, is there any update to 1.4 that works on this?

Because when I boot the game it shows up as 1.3..."

,Rydillac,2012-08-23T10:37Z,"Nevermind...i had a feeling i was just being impatient even after reading the ""be patient"" part. so far so good the auto install didnt work for me i had to manually extract it all. we shall see if all the naysayers are correct. 

but chill out before you start throwin names and fists if it doesnt work im sure your probably doin something wrong or your system just doesnt work well for it. dont be a child about it and just move on."

,crazyguns,2012-08-23T16:17Z,"ok most comments here are dumb spam so ill write some legit stuff.
downloaded this in a few hours. ran the setup.exe. it had a half naked girl image.. these installers should be more subtle man!!! anyway i chose the folder where 29gb was free. started install. it took 1 hour 45 minutes!!!! i left it and watched a movie n stuff, kept doing its thing, my free space went from 29gb to 2gb!!!! then it completed installation, and went to 17gb free. total install size 9gb. BUT you need atleast 30 gigs free in the hard drive for it to do its heavy duty extraction thing.

Now for the game-
i didn't have to download ANY other crack. just ran the hk exe thing and game started!! configured HD textures on, and it looks great! game plays awesomely, hooked up my game  pad and played for 3 hours straight! no problems what so ever.


My pc specs 
Core i5 750 
4GB Ram
1TB Hard disk
Nvidia GTS 250."

,CriticalMass88,2012-08-24T06:00Z,"Very easy! Only took a bit over an hour to DL, then all I did was run KK installation application and directed where to install the game. That was it! Ten minutes later, I was playing! My system has Solid State HDD's so if you're using magnetic drives, depending on your specs, it could take longer, possibly much longer to install. Once installed, double click on the Sleeping Dogs Icon. The file name is HKShip. That should be it! I haven't  needed to update or anything. It might of updated for me?"
