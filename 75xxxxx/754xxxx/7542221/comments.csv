,FulcrumX,2012-08-18T03:45Z,"I successfully activated my W8 Enterprise by using the ff method:

Volume MAK Key for Enterprise VL
 PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C 

 How to activate your Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise:

 1. Run cmd as admin. Enter slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C (Only for Enterprise and Pro)
 2. Turn off your internet connection
 3. Open activation window and click ""Activate"". It'll show your an error.
 4. After that you'll see ""Activate by phone"" button.
 5.  i used united kingdom for the country, Call microsoft and enter code from message, which you will see.
 6. you should choose for business, If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1

this should work and your w8 should be activated for good. goodluck!"
,TunaHead,2012-08-18T07:40Z,What's in a hurry for? I could wait for 3 more months. I'm happy with windows 7 installed on my laptop.

please. :D"
,greyaburton,2012-08-18T18:18Z,"@fulcrumx when i tried it,the machine part said had a problem with verifying and was going to transfer me to a representative,figured that was a bad idea,so i hung up?"
,[RS]Razr,2012-08-18T19:05Z,"To everyone: I'm going to save you the trouble. First off all activation methods are currently thwarted. Micro$hit will no longer activate you on the old methods. Also there is always a danger in using keys as you can get locked out of your system if caught and will be unable to activate if a proper hacktivation comes out. Its best to keep your copies of the windows 8 install on discs or thumb-drives until then and stick with windows 7 keeping a daily eye on the scene at least twice a day morning and night for a working method. And lastly windows 8 hasn't even hit the stores officially yet so any sort of activation is nada. Even the developers will have to activate later, possibly having to purchase the product (after all micro$hit wants their money) so its very likely any key we currently have will get blacklisted in the end. Yes I want it too but I'm not sacrificing my data on an upgrade to be considered inactivated and blocked later. I'll wait for a permanent solution. I suggest you do the same if your data is important to you."
