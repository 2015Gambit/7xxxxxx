The story starts in the magnificent eighties. With Mario and Thomas who are then already clearly friends for life. Lynn is the wild cat between them. The gang is never complete without Speck, the hopeless philosophy student who nearly always puts his foot in it. Mario marrying, becoming a father and divorcing, and eventually getting ill, having to renounce to his political career. As Mario’s fight to legalise euthanasia becomes more and more personal, and as Belgium seems on his way to become the second country to pass this legislation, Thomas is torn between the loyalty to his friend, and the pledge to his parents to try and make Mario change his mind. ‘Time of your life’ talks about what happens in a country where for the first time in history people who suffer can decide on their own life or death. How about the fathers, mothers, children, partners and friends How will they all deal with a young man who keeps on saying that it’s not the quantity of life that matters, but the quality. What happens when people are askedto do the impossible Time of my life is a heart-warming story about friendship. And about life.
