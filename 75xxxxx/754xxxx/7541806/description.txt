Scott's guests include:

Journalist Gareth Porter discusses why Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are bluffing when they threaten a unilateral attack on Iran; how the Bush administrationΓÇÖs hawkish Iran policy advanced -- rather than hindered -- IranΓÇÖs nuclear program; why Netanyahu doesnΓÇÖt have enough leverage to get President Obama to start a war; and why high-level US policymakers are almost always "bad people with terrible ideas."

Blogger Marcy Wheeler discusses EcuadorΓÇÖs decision to grant diplomatic asylum to WikileaksΓÇÖ Julian Assange; consequent British threats to revoke embassy sovereignty and detain Assange by force; the broad assumption that US pressure is forcing the British overreaction; SwedenΓÇÖs previous cooperation with CIA torture rendition requests; and why this is probably all about extraditing Assange to the US, where heΓÇÖll be put in Guantanamo or prosecuted under the Espionage Act.
