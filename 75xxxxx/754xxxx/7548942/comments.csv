,akalbabb,2012-08-20T01:46Z,Thank you for reseeding and putting a great book back into circulation! I will reseed at least three times!
,akalbabb,2012-08-20T07:08Z,"Downloaded this within an hour of being reseeded. It was uploaded for the first time within another hour. Read practically all of it in one sitting - just couldn't stop. A work that deserves a place among all memoirs, not just just the chess sub-category. Thank you, Djofullinn! "

,akalbabb,2012-08-20T22:16Z,I've already seeded three times but have decided to go further. It would be great if Sosonko's two other books of memoirs were uploaded. 
[T],Djofullinn,2012-08-20T23:59Z,"akalbabb, I have Smart Chip somewhere I remember, will upload when I find it.  My spoils are frankly mountainous after years of pirating but rather disorganized. Not sure about Reliable Past but I will look."
,akalbabb,2012-08-21T20:09Z,"Thank you, Djofullinn. Will watch out for them. "
