These are Sayed Ammar Nakshawani's Ramadhan 2011 majalis that give an overview of the biographies of the 14 Infallibles, starting with the Holy Prophet ('S), Bibi Fatima ('a) and the 12 Imams upto Imam Mahdi (ajfs). May these lectures inspire you as they did me and help shed light on the lives of the Masomeen, how they became the walis of the Holy Prophet ('S) and what trials they underwent.


This is my first torrent upload so forgive any oversight and suggestions are ofcourse welcome.
