,jtjh,2012-08-19T14:42Z,No audio and there are subtitles in the video. the additional subs won't work because of that
,314pirate,2012-08-19T16:25Z,"Subtitles in video are annoying.  If you're an English speaker, I'd recommend getting a different torrent."
,Normalcy,2012-08-21T09:28Z,"Subtitles are actually not hard-coded, you can disable them by using the VLC player and disabling all subtitles under Video->Subtitles. I believe this is possible using MKVmerge too.

Skip this torrent unless you want danish subtitles or enjoy hassles."
