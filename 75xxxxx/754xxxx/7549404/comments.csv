[T],iamgreat,2012-08-23T12:56Z,"What 2HD released as s05e08 ""Stroll On The Wild Side Part 2"" is actually s05e11 ""Murdoch In Toyland"".

What 2HD released as s05e11 ""Murdoch In Toyland"" is actually s01e09 ""Belly Speaker"".

The release of s05e07 ""Stroll On The Wild Side Part 1"" is correct.

Since mSD uses the 2HD releases as their source this collection of errors is found here too."
