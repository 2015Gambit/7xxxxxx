This is the original Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 ISO (Volume License) including Microsoft updates till 18.08.2012, Internet Explorer 8, Adobe Flash Player 11.3 and SATA drivers.

- This release is the best you could find on the net, because it's just simple:

* NO tweaks or add-ons.
* NO additional programs and software added.
* NO graphics, scripts and wallpapers added or changed.
* NO serial needed during installation, the key is already inserted.
* It's just the original image from Microsoft except updates, IE8, Adobe Flash Player (11.3.300.271) and SATA drivers!
* Windows Messenger, MSN Explorer and Internet Explorer 6 were removed.
