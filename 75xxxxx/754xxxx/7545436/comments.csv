Tested this and the Repair Option is still not working and no infos again about this in the description."
,princelouize,2012-08-20T00:22Z,is this activated?
,Husain.87,2012-08-20T00:25Z,^^ because of SATA drivers
,B.Torrents,2012-08-20T12:08Z,"@ T0m1980 The Repair Option is not available because of when SATA drivers are ADDED the I386 folder gets modified. If that folder gets modified even a bit then the repair option gets DISABLED

@ princelouize Yes All Copies of Windows XP from Maherz are Pre - Activated, So Don't Worry."

,MhrBhr,2012-08-21T14:24Z,"Thanks a lot Maher.
Please if I want to add all drivers packs from www.driverpacks.net to your current .iso one and make a big dvd, please advise how can I do so?

@MTHassan
@AllzCool123
Thank you guys ;)

@dstefan
@winx86
You're welcome.

@fiyeroisme
Integrating drivers using nLite won't break anything.
Good luck.

@MhrBhr
Extract the ISO then integrate drivers using DriverPack BASE, then make ISO again.
Good luck.

@winx86
Just turn on automatic updates and you'll get the updates :)"

,yogiwilly,2012-08-26T21:31Z,"I've been using a CD. Is that not allowed? Also, I keep getting it onto the CD but it has MULTIPLE files it says are missing. I'd say at least 20-30 files by like 65%. "
,yogiwilly,2012-08-26T21:41Z,"I've tired this on imgburn and poweriso and it says im missing files, between 20-30 by 65%. This is what I've tried..

IMGBURN >> open >> write image file to disk >> picked out the .iso from my utorrent download >> then clicked BURN.  (( I've tried it at Max Speed, 3x speed, 48x and 8x)) out of the 5 times, 3 didn't work and 2 worked but said missing files during instillation. 

PowerISO: open the program >> open >> choose .iso file from torrent download >> BURN >> speed (ive done max and 48) those are the only two options I have -- and with everyone it has said missing files. multiple files.

I also tried downloading TWO other XPs and trying both, and they ALL say missing files. What am I doing wrong??? Someone please help me. "

Saying that, I see that the problem is with your CD/DVD drive itself! Almost 100% sure!"

,Tovagulet,2012-09-02T16:42Z,"@rjon302
Why you don't want SATA Drivers?

@viggen6666
Not many people use x64-bit of Windows XP... its not really worthy, and where the hell does he get original copy of Windows XP 64-bit ... really hard tbh."
[V],Maherz,2012-09-02T20:41Z,"@Aciaeiig
I won't :)
Actually, I still have the November 2011 release :)

@rjon302
It's the same! Even if you don't have SATA you can still use it.

Sorry, I don't do XP x64..

@Tovagulet
Yea, why? :)"

i must say i really like maherz's xp releases. clean and stable. the june release is running on 4 different machines with no signes of problems. thanks for the hard work"
,Tovagulet,2012-09-07T04:43Z,"@Legret
Its just XP SP3 no need to install SP1 or SP2, and comes with the latest updates till August 2012.

@Bake_Neko
It doesn't come with Microsoft Office.
Its the original copy and Windows doesn't come with Office.

@samba2902
Lmao, what are you talking about...
Just burn the .iso file into a CD or DVD and it will just boot.
As long as the file you burn is the .iso everything should be good... it goes the same for all Windows versions."
