,Spartan4ever,2012-08-23T02:28Z,"YES I DID IT finally i have the whole file...
By the Way, it crashes after ~10 mins anyone has a solution?"
,blackjuker,2012-08-23T17:29Z,Its works for me
,amberlini,2012-08-23T18:23Z,I am new to torrenting. How do I get this to work? It is a very big file so it will not burn onto any of the simple blank cd's I currently have.
,Joew99,2012-08-23T19:36Z,"Downloading now, hopefully this works!"
,Chicochoh,2012-08-24T17:13Z,"installing it on my laptop, cant wait to play"
,Shanlot,2012-08-25T05:05Z,"Won't let me get the torrent. Get ""404- torrent not found""  :/ "
,kilzmaster,2012-08-26T09:25Z,"@amberlini
You need to download a virtual cd drive program such as MagicDisc. Then you can mount the ISOs virtually with no need to burn them to a disc"
,jenistos,2012-08-28T19:26Z,"Nice overall size, especially compared to this: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7512872/The_Sims_3_Collection

However ...

Would it be possible to install new content in the future (Seasons, Supernatural, new patches, etc.) on top of the installation based on this torrent?

I'm asking because these Sims games are strict about patch validations (no registry entry or different size of the .exe file (i.e. cracked) equals new content refusing to install)."
,Korabar,2012-09-03T20:14Z,"I get an error stating ""Your Sims 3 base game is incompatible with the installed expansion pack. Please update your game via the launcher.""
I have tried updating it with Patch 38, but that completely breaks it.

Could anyone help out?"
,modded00,2012-09-06T23:50Z,"will this crack everything itself and sintall all expansions at once? Meaning i wont need to use cd keys or copy and past any .dll files, and install expansions separately?"
,drago148,2012-09-08T03:32Z,"For those who want to know, just install it and its ready to go, no crack or keygen. Sad part it was patched after the expansion install, so no inteen and many new bug added. 

ANyway like always Blackbox got good stuff."
,IONHFPIDK,2012-09-08T03:35Z,"HELP NEEDED PLEASE:
I have a problem when ""installing"" the game, Once it reaches 42.3% in the installing process it gives me this :Decompression problem:Broken compressed data. then says to press okay, after that it tells me:An error occurred when unpacking!
Unarc.dll returned an error code:-1
ERROR archive data corrupted (decompression fails.   I REALLY NEED HELP AND WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED PLEASE "
,IONHFPIDK,2012-09-08T03:38Z,And i think it might be important to say that i installed it on drive D and not on C because there wasnt any space on it
,RazerIXx,2012-09-09T13:38Z,Will i be able to install the Supernatural expansion on this?
,emmaxgud,2012-09-13T10:00Z,"installed fine, went to start the game ""Unable to start. Please reinstall the base game."" ?? installing again to see if i missed anything. mounted with magic disk.. don't know what else to do.. /:"
,peppi_le_piou,2012-09-14T07:15Z,"What SKU version is Sims 3 base game and World Adventures, I'm looking for a US version (sku ending with ""1"") so that I don't have to mess with the wrong region messages. All my other packs after those two are 1's so need S3 and WA."
,aznpryde,2012-09-17T03:35Z,"Works great all you gotta do is mount the iso then run the setup and wait until it finishes installing then play and I'm gonna be seeding for 2 days, already uploaded 16.2gb xp good luck on getting it to work "
,MilkywayCandy,2012-09-17T06:42Z,"I'm downloading now, I will see how is works with supernatural and will comment back if it does or doesn't."
