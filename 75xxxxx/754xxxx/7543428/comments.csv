Im using the SKIDROW release on windows 7. Ive replaced all files in %appdata%localSKIDROW50650storage and also My GamesdarkSiders 2English.
Any help would much appreciated! :)"
,DJ_Salinger1234,2012-08-18T10:59Z,"Crap, backslashes did not show up in that comment.. folders are.. (with dots instead of slashes)

%appdata%.local.SKIDROW.50650.Storage

and

My Games.Darksiders2.English

also I replaced the options.dopt in

%appdata%.local.darksiders2"
,DJ_Salinger1234,2012-08-18T20:38Z,"I found a fix. If you use a hex editor (eg notepad ++ with a hex plugin) and replace position 20F to 304 from a new save into the one you want to add it works!! :)

Also this is bleedin' ridiculous! why ure saves not work like normal thq!?? "
,spinsz1,2012-08-19T18:15Z,"@DJ_Salinger1234
    How did you get it to work? I made a new save and copied the hex sections to the old save I want to use and it's still corrupted... which files did you edit?"

pls, write a instruction how make it"
,saikorican,2012-08-27T06:33Z,"The saves have to be fixed using a method described in the darksiders 2 forums involving hex and a save originally from your pc, it's not hard to find. The saves in here only have a lot of money and otherwise aren't worth downloading because they're only level 7-9."
