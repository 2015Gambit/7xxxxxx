[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-08-19T18:19Z,@suckerp: No this is the Crack ONLY for 1.4 patch
,Psgmen,2012-08-19T18:31Z,where is the update ???? how to download the update ???
,methanphetamine,2012-08-19T18:38Z,so.... this real or what ?
,Neoncillo,2012-08-19T18:54Z,"Using the other crack UI was not showing, this one solved it."
,vekh,2012-08-19T19:28Z,This is the right patch. The patch with 1.4GB is with HiRes DLC!!
,dandalis,2012-08-19T20:16Z,is this the legit 1.4 update or what ? why other one is bigger than 1 gb ?

,plooxx,2012-08-19T23:58Z,"Damn it... This one wont work for me neither, Im going to sleep now better luck tomorrow i guess!"
,Militance,2012-08-20T12:15Z,"Why the fuck did you title this torrent Sleeping.Dogs.Update.1.4.Cracked.P2P , this means that there is an update and that its cracked, but apparently this is only a crack, wtf are you on crack or something???? you say one thing on the title then you tell us its crack only .....GOOOOOOOOOOOOF!!!!!!!"
,lainiwaku,2012-08-20T15:03Z,"it's not work, nothing happen when i start  the .exe"
,RruleTT,2012-08-20T15:34Z,I think this may be the crack for the legit 1.4 Update but since the updates I'm seeing I think only go up to 1.3 then that's why it don't work I did find this though > http://uploaded.net/file/z4um1nt9/Sle3ep5ingD7og9sPatch1.3-1.4_M7-elamigos.rar MAYBE it works right now I used the 1.3 Update with crack and all is well
,methanphetamine,2012-08-20T18:13Z,"i got the same problem as lainiwaku, the game doesn't start after i applied this update. anyone knows a fix ?"
,Humpie,2012-08-21T00:44Z,"@RruleTT

I tried that link and it is still 1.3 and now locks the settings. "
,bayharborbutcher,2012-08-24T02:09Z,"@Humpie
Yeah from what I hear even the legit 1.4 update still reports the game as being ver 1.3 but as long as it saves the settings that should mean the game has been updated."
,freehugs2me,2012-08-24T05:23Z,"seed please, this is going way to slow :("
,likeafallenangel,2012-08-24T18:09Z,It worked really well for me. Thank you! :D
,kcfunnthesun,2012-08-24T22:12Z,"this looks suspicious, to say the least"
,boogschd,2012-08-29T03:07Z,"i tried pasting everything in the installation dir and it works

somewhat

i couldnt get it to go full screen
 in the first mission - the ""NAZ"" guy stops midway .. i tried to continue without him and it worked though 

but after the first mission (where you get arrested)

the game freezes :/"
,boogschd,2012-08-29T03:26Z,"okay so i got to the 2nd mission
up to where you fight three guys in a hotel

the dont die or fight, they just push you around
no menus, no hud ..

at this point i thought its probably a bug or something .. i just force closed the game"
