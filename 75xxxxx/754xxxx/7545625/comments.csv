Both of them are v1.00; if you have v1.10, then please upload. :)"

After downloading, remember to get the v1.30 Hotfix over at Iris' website."
,NGGhoSt,2012-08-19T23:21Z,"Well I payed for mine so its fully up to date. 
But I cannot find the .exe for it at the moment.

If I could just remember the site I got it from i would re-download it. Give me a few days and i will get the newest version with the hotfix uploaded."
