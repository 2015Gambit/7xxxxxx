,mata1959,2012-08-23T15:17Z,Installer doesn´t work. I´ve downloaded trial version from web site but serials aren´t good at all!
,set321,2012-09-09T19:09Z,"If you have problems this worked for me:
Right click ""Trapcode Suite 12.0.0 Installer""
Show package contents 
Browse to ""Trapcode Suite 12.0.0.mpkg""
Copy this and put it somewhere else (that's what I did maybe you can skip that step)
Right click and open this file with disk utility. Now you can create a DMG file and open. Worked for me."
