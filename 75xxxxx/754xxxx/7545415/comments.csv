v/9...a/10

If you are just wanting to watch these eps, then this torrent is great, nothing more to do.

If you want them for your collection, then you might need to do a little work. This is not a criticism, merely what I like, as I like my files as lean as possible, I downloaded this torrent and ran the AVI files thru Handbrake (high profile/mkv/no anamorphic/audio on ac3 passthru) and now they are as good as the ones I got off of my own DVD's and only run at about 170Mb per episode. I left the avi's in place so I can seed for a while tho.

As the top line says, BEST QUALITY you will find out there. Thanks Again."
