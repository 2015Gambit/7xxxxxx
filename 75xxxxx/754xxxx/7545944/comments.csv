,neDav,2012-08-19T15:56Z,"How do you extract the image, when I use WinRar, it says the archive is currupt."
,Kriute,2012-08-19T18:34Z,To neDav: Hundreds of us have this now so we know its legit. So you know how to create a Pirate Bay account for the sole purpose of leaving a comment but you imply that you cannot open multiple zip files that hundreds of us have done successfully. What is corrupt here is you dipshit. Leave now. Goodbye.
,neDav,2012-08-19T21:56Z,"Thanks dude, but that still doesn't answer my question. "
,Stymieblue,2012-08-19T22:23Z,"Just redownload it then, and this works perfectly, THANKS!"
,ioniancat21,2012-08-21T00:42Z,"NeDev is correct, archive is corrupted. Fails consistancy checks using 7-Zip and WinRAR. If your download is working, consider yourself lucky...."

,Truvbay,2012-08-21T19:20Z,"I installed the latest 7zip, which is 92. Then extracted the archive. The archive contains an ISO, which you can mount/burn/etc.

The entire process took almost three minutes.

The ISO is perfect, this up is perfect. If anyone cannot get this very simple process to work, I would suggest you turn your computer off, and keep it off. Go buy a tablet or something.

Thanks for the up!"
