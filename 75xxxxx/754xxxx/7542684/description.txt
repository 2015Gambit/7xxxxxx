From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, August 17 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex welcomes economist, journalist and American broadcaster Max Keiser to discuss the warning signs of an impending economic collapse, the effect this will have globally and solutions that would bring us back from certain financial doom. 

Alex also welcomes former special agent of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service Joseph Banister.
