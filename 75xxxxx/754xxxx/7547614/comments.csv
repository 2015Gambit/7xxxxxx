[V],.Dude.,2012-08-19T19:30Z,STROON: yes
,Sivos,2012-08-19T19:41Z,"I got the ""service isn't available at this time"" freeze, so I used this crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547692/Sleeping.Dogs.Update.1.4.Cracked.P2P after .Dude.'s and it worked fine.  Although, I noticed that in the first part when you're running with Naz (the objective is to follow him), Naz will stop running, but you can continue on without him and he'll eventually catch up.  I don't know if that's because of the torrent I used or the crack or just a random glitch, but it's just a heads up if this happens to you.  The torrent I'm using for the full game was deleted from here, so this may not happen with Hero's torrent.  And for those who are confused, if you don't want subtitles, pick the chengism (or however it's spelled) that's English subs for when they speak Chinese and no subs when they speak English; removing subs all together will remove the Chinese to English ones."
,fadmos,2012-08-19T19:54Z,"@Dude the link you put up for the update, any chance  you can make a torrent for it seeing as its over 1 gig? thanks in advanced "

,11770,2012-08-20T22:25Z,hey .dude. every1 keeps saying the 1.4 update u posted gives them 1.3... whats with that?
,The4X3R,2012-08-21T05:13Z,"@11770
The version showing 1.3 instead of 1.4 is normal for now, also it's normal that the DLCs are not showing themselves in menus, and there's problem with video options saving, which can be fixed by editing displaysettings.xml in Data folder of the game"

,ivory_soul,2012-09-16T08:15Z,"I found a way to install HD textures but it is a HUGE pain in the ass. First you have to re-install this download (most of you already have it) with HD textures in a SEPERATE location.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7551450/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_MULTI_7_CRACKED_NEW_UPDATE_1.4

2.Copy over from NEW location the following files into the OLD location.

Characters.big and .bix
CharactersHD.big and .bix

GameHD and HD2.big and .bix
Game.big and .bix
Sleeping Dogs has WAY too many different updates, cracks, patches, and fixes. This game is an absolute nightmare and I have been cracking games since I was 15. Here's my instructions to get 1.5 and DLC working.

1) Download this torrent game and install it with HD textures.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7551450/Sleeping_Dogs_Limited_Edition_MULTI_7_CRACKED_NEW_UPDATE_1.4

2)Download this 1.4 update, copy in into the install directory and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547939/3DMGAME-Sleeping.dogs.v1.4.Update-3DM.7z

3)Copy over this 1.4 crack and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7547614/Sleeping_Dogs_-_v1.4_-_3DM_Crack_Only

4) Download this 1.5 update and overwrite.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7587843/Sleeping_Dogs_v1.4_to_v1.5_Update_%28_36_MB_%29 

Run the 1.4-1.5.bat file and ignore the errors.

5) To get DLC working download this torrent and copy to Sleeping Dogs folder and overwrite when asked.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7597494/Sleeping_Dogs_v1.5_Crack_with_All_DLC(Working)

6)Open LumaEmu.ini and replace the path for steam_api.dll with the current Sleeping Dogs path.

That's it! I did this exactly and the game launched with no issues!

I know the 1.5 update changes Game.big, but if you want HD textures this is the way to do it. I didn't have any issues so far with slowdown or FPS drops. I did this about 2 weeks ago, so I'm pretty sure those are all the files you need to transfer."
