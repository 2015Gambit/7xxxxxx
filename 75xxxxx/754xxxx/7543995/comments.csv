,NinpoLore,2012-08-20T23:04Z,"File size and everything looks good so I'll give it a try, but I'll admit that I'm going with this particular because so far there are no comments about this upload being tracked. I'm sure it is - all newly released films are tracked intensely, but no complaints in the comments section so far. 

That being said, the moment someone gets an e-mail from their ISP about this torrent, do be a chap and let us know immediately! Until then, I offer my most gracious thanks, neon. :)"
