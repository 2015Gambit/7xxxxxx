,mnmlb,2012-08-18T08:14Z,"This isn't cracked, is it?"
,millennium5,2012-08-18T12:19Z,"It doesn't need cracking, its MSDN. @cafevn thank you so very much for this up, great job, I got it a day before from Russia but I did not have the guts to post it. Thank you!"

,cafevn,2012-08-18T15:37Z,"MSDN version do not need any crack/serial.

just install and enjoy."
,xpmule,2012-08-18T18:53Z,"did some checking..

this is what is posted at MDL.

Microsoft does not release the 64-bit (x64) version of Visual Studio 2012, hence only 32-bit (x86) is available.

So that is like previous versions, nothing too unusual about that.

Also if people are wondering what the difference is between the MSDN release and the WZT release is see here..

http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/36132-Visual-Studio-2012-WZT-VS-MSDN

basicly people figured out that they built-in key is different. The key is inserted into the setup.exe so people could actualy patch their WZT iso's to match the msdn one's if they wanted.

I think it goes with out saying that these iso's are preferred over any other ones. If your gonna get VS2012 then get the MSDN versions.."
,vinx02,2012-08-19T10:37Z,"does this mean you dont need to a product key anymore?
is MSDN version free?"
,millennium5,2012-08-21T02:19Z,"@vinx02: No that means that the software is downloadable directly from Microsoft if you have a MSDN subscription costing you $13,299.00 dollars a year.

if you don't know this this version of Visual Studio is wrong for you, get the express version for free. This version will only make your head spin, trust me a novice developer does not need this version, it will just slow you down and make things more difficult for you."
,vinx02,2012-08-21T15:52Z,"@millennium5: Thanks for the reply. one more question. If you have a subscription in MSDN, then all the software you download there don't need a serial or product key. am i right?"
,xpmule,2012-08-22T07:39Z,"you can always pick and choose what to install though for example i only ever install c++ related components.
And there are real limitations to the free version. notably the fact that it can't do a lot of resources related stuff i think."
,mohit09,2012-08-25T21:39Z,"i am getting less speed 
It might be due to slow internet and many downloaders.


thnx for the great upload"
,dionmeyer,2012-09-01T12:49Z,Will this work on a 64-Bit?
,LeliGamer,2012-09-01T14:34Z,"From what I have seen, yes, this is capable of running on 64-bit although the main iso has ""x86.""
But I have a question on this. Do I have to install the lst one in the list? PLEASE RESPOND!"
,LeliGamer,2012-09-01T14:35Z,"Sorry I meant do I have to install the LAST one in the list? It is called, ""en_visual_studio_ultimate_2012_x86_dvd_920947.iso"""
,ortizh1,2012-09-01T15:41Z,I have the same question in this package are all the version and i chose the one that i want or i have to install 1 in specifice like the one that say visual studio ultimate to install all the package. Thanks!
,LeliGamer,2012-09-01T15:49Z,"Okay I think I found out how.
THE LAST ONE IS THE MAIN ONE, THE OTHERS ARE JUST ADDONS. PLEASE GUYS REMEMBER TO DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET BEFORE INSTALLING THIS!!!!!!"
,LeliGamer,2012-09-01T21:19Z,WOW this worked!!!!!! Seriously who is leeching but not seeding should get a life! I seeded a few! THANKS GREAT UPLOAD!
,ra1eigh,2012-09-02T18:27Z,"This guy is legitimate. Visual Studio 2012 is some damn good software by the way, +1 to Microsoft!"
,ra1eigh,2012-09-02T21:32Z,This is perfect!!!!! God you're awesome. 
,securitron2000,2012-09-12T01:11Z,The hash for VS Ultimate (en_visual_studio_ultimate_2012_x86_dvd_920947.iso) does not match the sha1.txt / MSDN hashcode.
,securitron2000,2012-09-12T03:40Z,"This torrent has the VS Ultimate ISO that matches the MSDN hashcode (6A2B87BCD336A96AC39CF85348E93E5AF45588EB), which you can see on MSDN's site:
