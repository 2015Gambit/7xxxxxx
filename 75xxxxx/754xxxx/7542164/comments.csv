How to activate your Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise:

1. Run cmd as admin. Enter slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C (Only for Enterprise and Pro)
2. Turn off your internet connection
3. Open activation window and click ""Activate"". It'll show your an error.
4. After that you'll see ""Activate by phone"" button.
5. Call to microsoft and enter code from message, which you will see.
6. If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1

Found it on here and it works for me. The Enterprise 64-bit is fully activated forever."

Yes you have to talk to customer service and they will give you an activation code. If it doesn't work you will have to search online or Google a new method. I just posted what worked for me. But Microsoft might just caught on. Dang they loosing money before they can make money. lol"
,guccicar,2012-08-18T21:53Z,"@ torrentadmin
I can find they pro version online. But the pro version is on TPB anyway. No need for me to compete with the rest."

You might have got that Product Key working with the Enterprise Edition, but for Windows 8 Pro is does (NOT) work. You can not even install Windows using that key, so I used another key to would and followed your instructions but phone activation says it is not valid."

,FulcrumX,2012-08-23T00:31Z,"there's still a way to use this blocked product key on 64bit Windows 8 Enterprise/Pro VL, go to cmd, run as admin type the ff: slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C , press enter, after that type in slui 4. press enter. if you got the same set of numbers on blocks 1-9, then you should be able to use the codes shown on blocks A-H. remember this is for 64 bit Windows 8 Enterprise/Pro VL. refer to the pic on the link and just enter the numbers. http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy62/laxluster/CaptureF3G7Cx64.jpg"

Both the above mentioned images contains all the editions of windows 8 except enterprise and the select installation depends upon the type of key you enter during installation and also this version is retail but can be converted to volume just by using the volume key during installation!"
