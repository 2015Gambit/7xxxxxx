Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde ΓÇô 3xCD Deluxe Edition 


The PharcydeΓÇÖs seminal debut release expanded to a triple CD issue with detailed liner notes by producer J-Sw!ft, and rare vintage photos of the group all contained within a deluxe hinged box with magnetic clasp for easy access to some of the best hip hop of all time. Widely regarded as a pioneering album of the West CoastΓÇÖs then-emerging alternative hip hop scene, The PharcydeΓÇÖs 1992 debut Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde makes a triumphant reappearance two decades later in this deluxe 3xCD set by the good folks at Delicious Vinyl. Drawing from a laundry list of sampled jazz and soul greats to construct its musical sound scape, Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde marked the entry of The Pharcyde into the arena of beloved hip hop icons in the decades to come. Sonically, producer J-Sw!ftΓÇÖs jazzy sampling and lush instrumentation provide a stark contrast to the hard-hitting gangsta rap dominating West CoastΓÇÖs contributions to hip hop of the time,
further complementing the laid-back comedic lyricism of emcees Fatlip, Bootie Brown, Imani, and Slimkid3 with a style seldom heard since. This superbly arranged deluxe reissue includes the original album in its entirety, plus two additional discs including instrumentals, remixes, and ΓÇÿb-cydes.ΓÇÖ Fans will be pleased to find producer J-Sw!ftΓÇÖs extended liner notes included alongside vintage photos of the group. This deluxe reissue is housed in a beautiful hinged box with magnetic clasp emblazoned with the iconic rollercoaster cover art by Fuct. This updated release of The PharcydeΓÇÖs classic album makes for a bizarre ride not to be missed.
