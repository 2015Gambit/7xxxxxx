Child prodigy, Adam Young, is headed to the ninth grade - for the second time. Having completed it in thirty-five minutes the first time around, he's joined the students of Finnegan as a high school science teacher.

Adam went to University at the age of nine, and now, at fourteen, he's a college graduate and ready to enter the workforce. Job offers from pharmaceutical companies, dot-com's and NASA were intriguing, but he turned them all down to become a teacher.

With one foot in the lunchroom and the other in the staff room, Adam is trapped between two worlds. His co-workers and boss are more than twice his age - in some cases, a lot more. And, his students include his best friend, Derby, the girl he has a crush on, Echo, and Slab, the class bully.

All Adam wants is the chance to have the normal high school experience, but things are rarely in his favour...
