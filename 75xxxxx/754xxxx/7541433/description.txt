Extreme: From Valley Deep to Mountain High 
This exquisite documentary guides audiences through the world's extremes, comparing life at sea-level with the highest mountains of the world. The vastly different landscapes featured range from the low-lying lagoons and palm beaches of the South Sea Islands which are threatened by rising sea levels, to Ethiopia's highland table mountains and breathtaking ravines. More contrasts can be found between the shores of the Dead Sea, 425 metres below sea level, and the highest inhabited place on Earth, La Rinconada at 5100 metres in the Peruvian Andes.
