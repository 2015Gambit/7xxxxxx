What a ride it's been for Norah Jones since that night in March of 2002, where she first unveiled her rich and seductive voice while performing in a crowded room above an Indian restaurant in downtown Austin, TX at a South by Southwest showcase. A few months later she recorded her first Austin City Limits. Now, after five years, many millions of records sold, a shelf full of Grammy awards and worldwide acclaim, Norah returns to Austin City Limits as one of the most successful and respected recording artists of the decade. This performance from June 14, 2007, includes some of those now classics that captivated an audience longing for true heartfelt music.
