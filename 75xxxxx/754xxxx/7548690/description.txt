Tasty jazz picking from relatively obscure Howard Roberts; although well known to 

musicians who admire his gifts.



Source Provenance:  1977 recording released as CD in 1994.  I burned a friend's CD 

to CDR using Philips 2-tray consumer burner (a piece of crap)  but it worked great

that time in 2003...CDR then ripped via EAC today for your listening pleasure.

basically a digital CLONE...don't be afraid


If you love Joe Pass and Wes Montgomery you need to hear Howard Roberts
