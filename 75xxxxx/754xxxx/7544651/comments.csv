,falafelface,2012-08-18T18:07Z,why nearly 2gb's for a less than an hour talk show that people are gonna trash after watching
,Kilroy222,2012-08-18T18:50Z,"Get it from EZTV http://t.co/LgLp4KtK (No spam, it's a twitter link to the torrent file) Don't bother with scene(anything)"
[V],sceneline,2012-08-18T19:02Z,people enjoy the quality and don't care about the time
,susipus,2012-08-18T20:38Z,"Falafalface, is it so hard to understand that, the bigger the file is, the better the quality is??

And thanx alot sceneline, please continue keeping up the support for big files. :-)

If the others like sd quality so be it.
You'll notice the difference if you got a 120 inch screen like me!!"
,falafelface,2012-08-18T20:44Z,"Thanks Kilroy.. superb quality!!

Scene.. that may be, but for a talk show, needing 1.7 gb's is obsessing on the subatomic level and a few tweaks from full out dementia.  ;)

It just seems waaaaaay overkill for what the content is that's all."
