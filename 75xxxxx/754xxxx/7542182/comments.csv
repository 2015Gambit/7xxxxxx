but obviously its only me saying this so..

people are already saying there is problems.
I'm not surprised what do you all expect calling MS on the phone and activating a key ?
All they have to is check that every call is made from a diff country and then deactivate you.
And then after that you would lucky if they didn't try and take your to court for piracy reasons etc..

completely crazy guys wow !
I think this is SUPER stupid beyond words."
[V],thethingy,2012-08-18T19:01Z,"xpmule, every mak key you see you post that on, you did the same with office 2010, I suggest that you first understand that mak means multiple activation key and phone activation is anonymous and once activated activation status is perpetual and cant be deactivated, still thanks for the rant.

,Chelicera45,2012-08-19T15:18Z,@xpmule Let me just tell you that thethingy is a very much trusted pirate and he doesn't just do things that will be no use in the end. What is the use of encouraging people to stop the nonsense in every Windows 8 Torrent here in TPB? Does it matter if you like Win 7 or XP more? What do you get by making a complete mess in somebody else's torrent by continuously despising the offer blatantly? Well I myself isn't taking this and I'm gonna wait for future critics that will interest me in the future. You are like making the activation process as your support as to keep people away from this version of Windows that didn't do a good impression on you. It also is for me unbelievable for you to say that you have 10 years of cracking experience if you really do not know how people work in the pirate world. Useless rant I must say and if thou shall continue it the more it stays as it should be.

I try and be helpful and i get an avalache of vicious nasty attitude and them I'm made out to be the jerk.. I'm not ranting about anything either I'm stating the obvious !
Just because you guys are too lazy to research don't call me a lyer.
Go read some of the many people who have reported their MAK keys were disabled simply because they were share online, NEVERMIND the fact that you guys are calling MS to activate them and THAT is what bugs me, myself and MANY others think this is a very bad idea but if you do it don't be surprised that you get at best unactivated or worst a call from your isp about complaints or a letter in the mail from a lawyer.

I was reading some of the topics at MDL forums the other day and i seen some people reporting this HAS happened so because i mean nothing and i'm no one, and you guys don't like me.. doesn't make me wrong.
Do your own homework and understand the risks. And i'm done here, take any risk you want guys but don't crucify me for pointing out the risks. Inexperienced users have the right to know what they are getting into.."
[V],thethingy,2012-08-25T03:09Z,"xpmule, dude, each and every mak key has x amount of online activations and x amount of phone activations then it dies or is reset, an office one I posted had 30,000 online activations then after they got used it got reset again but another one just died, at the end of the day no one thats been mak activated has ever been deactivated and if MS did not want to phone activate they would simply ask the name of the key holder, they dont so they clearly dont care so you are making quite a mountain out of a molehill. 

What is this letter from isp bullshit?, MS dont get your ip over the phone because you aren't using the internet and once mak activated no further activation checks are performed so your scare story is for what?

The risks are quite simply they tell you they aren't activating it and thats all, you are never asked your name even if you talk to an operator so what is with the scaremongering?
