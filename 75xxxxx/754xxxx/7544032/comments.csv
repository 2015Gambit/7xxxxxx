Now, the movie... so derivative. The beginning  you can basically say, without equivocation, is a direct ripoff of Shirley Jackson's the Lottery. They barely pause before dusting off this or that idea from various other stories (e.g., Koushun Takami's Battle Royale). I don't know if it would stand up in court but these people definitely need to deliver their royalty checks to the true writers they borrowed from. Unfortunately, they don't carry through in the execution. This is basically a bloodless film, the result of the drive to make everything PG-13 for revenue purposes, which destroyed any potential it might have had. They also had aspirations of profundity but pulled nothing together. Half-baked ideas about revolution, overcoming great odds, the human condition, repression etc., but they had nowhere to go because they didn't have a real writer. I would love to have seen what this could have
been if they had given just an outline to a guy like Frank Darabont, handed him a blank check and said make a great R movie. Now that would have been something to see."
