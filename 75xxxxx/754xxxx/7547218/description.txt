Balkanized epistemologies get analysized while disclaimers apply, except to good humor. An anti-war theme prevails, with thanks to 'Waltz for Bashir', who got left out of the credits because it rained. The entire webisode is dedicated to the legendary Robert (Bob) Venosa who passed away last year. Bob was one of the world's leading proponents of psychedelic art, having studied and worked under Salvador Dali. He was a good friend of Terence Mckenna, and myself.
