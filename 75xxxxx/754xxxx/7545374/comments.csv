Some people may not want to take a chance on downloading a rip that may or may not contain errors.  Even the best mastered CD can be ruined by a rip with errors.

Not everyone cares, but some do.  I was merely giving info so that users can decide for themselves if they want this or not.  No need for ignorant replies."

anyway Thanks
