When I try to open ""set-up.exe"" with The Unarchiver I get a message saying it can't be extracted using that program. 
Any suggestions?"
,WarmongerTM,2012-08-18T07:51Z,@Awesomeblage: What do you mean opening .exe with a archive manger? Your suppose to extract the 7zip and then run setup afterwards. Not while its still inside the archive (my guess what you are doing).

,nikkiabbott,2012-08-18T23:29Z,"I am new at this and having issues with patching the amtlib.dll file. When I try to save it, I get a message that says Access is Denied. What am I doing wrong?"
,mike285,2012-08-19T00:21Z,"It doesn't allow me to copy it over the amtlib.dll? Am I doing something wrong? I am able to open Adobe Photoshop uder the trial, but I'm guessing it will run out if I don't copy it over the amtlib.dll? Any help would be appreciated and Thanks for uploading this! "
,mike285,2012-08-19T00:24Z,I can't copy the adobe photoshop over the amtlib.dll file? Can you please explain further? Any help would be appreciated and thanks for the upload!
,mike285,2012-08-19T02:24Z,Sorry for double posting. I pressed submit and it didn't do anything so I didn't think it went through lol
,nikkiabbott,2012-08-19T02:30Z,I'm having the same issue as mike285...please help!
,WarmongerTM,2012-08-19T07:33Z,"You copy amtlib.dll into the install directory (C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6). You're getting ""Access Denied"" because you either have Photoshop open, or some aspect of Photoshop is still using that file. You should be able to reboot and copy it over right after the reboot. If not you will have to find out what process is using that file and kill it."
,nikkiabbott,2012-08-19T15:47Z,Thanks! That worked for me! Thanks so much for uploading :)
,rayal1950,2012-08-19T23:48Z,"Downloaded and unzipped. When trying to install doubleclick on the SetUp.exe quits with error: Data Execution Prevention. 

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a security feature that can help prevent damage to your computer from viruses and other security threats. Harmful programs can try to attack Windows by attempting to run (also known as execute) code from system memory locations reserved for Windows and other authorized programs. These types of attacks can harm your programs and files.

DEP can help protect your computer by monitoring your programs to make sure that they use system memory safely. If DEP notices a program on your computer using memory incorrectly, it closes the program and notifies you.

Any Ideas?

,bamafan613,2012-08-20T09:33Z,What do I do about the serial number?
,sara198725,2012-08-20T10:58Z,No problem with downloading run's fine but what do i do about the serial key ? or is it just a trial version ?
,picklepickle,2012-08-20T13:55Z,"If you can't copy the amtlib.dll file, disable your antivirus for a while if you have one. Install as a trial version then copy amtlib.dll in so you won't have to activate it. etc etc etc."
,mike285,2012-08-20T19:15Z,"I'm confused what you mean by just copy it in? I am able to copy the amtlib.dll file, but I'm confused with what exactly I do, because I looked up the information on the adobe photoshop, and it runs fine, but says it is just the trial version. I'm sorry if this is something simple, but I'm not sure what you mean by copy the adobe photoshop to the amtlib.dll. Like just click and drag it to the amtlib.dll file? because it won't let me do that. Thanks for the help so far though, I appreciate it."
,WarmongerTM,2012-08-21T02:03Z,You install Photoshop as Trial. Once installed you open up Photoshop as Trial. Close Photoshop and then copy amtlib.dll into the Photoshop install directory (C:/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS6). Open Photoshop again and it will be activated.
,mike285,2012-08-21T03:17Z,"Okay, I did that. Is there a way to check to see if it was activated as in it is not just the free trial? Thanks again."
,sara198725,2012-08-21T12:54Z,"for mike 285

,MLuminos,2012-08-22T01:43Z,Tried twice to install and replace amtlib.dll. Trial version still pops up. Anything i need to do such as run something as admin? I changed both 64 and 32 DLLs.
,pressek,2012-08-22T01:53Z,"I don't know how the dll file works with others, because my instalation keeps saying trial version and the days are going..............away..."
,knoxstory,2012-08-23T03:22Z,this torrent works great. thanks!!
,debank8,2012-08-24T13:18Z,Is it really EXTENDED ?
,Dhora86,2012-08-27T09:44Z,"Hey you guys! This does work! The person who put the torrent isn't being clear on what to do. I searched for days for this file he calls the ""Adobe Directory""... It doesn't exist. What you can do is follow step 1 & 2 (which is copying the amtlib.dll from either the 32bit/64bit which is found in the patch folder) and make sure the photoshop program is CLOSED. Here's the tricky part... Paste that code in ALL of the cs6 folders. Ex: C/program files (86)/adobe... paste it there, anywhere.... then you click on adobe utilities, then click on extended script, then you paste it there... go back two pages, then click extension manager cs6, guess what? Paste it there. go back one, go to adobe bridge cs6, and paste it there, and go back one, then click on the adobe, DO NOT CLICK ON THE PATCH folder... just paste it in the Adobe. 

I NEVER write reviews, but This torrent works well, and I want to give the provider credit... it seems there's a communication barrier. I'm not sure if you even needed to do all of this, but it worked for me and i was eager to spread the joy! Good day everyone!"

,SgtT4yB4cK,2012-08-27T19:23Z,I can't find where the amtlib.dll file that I'm supposed to transfer is. Any help please?
,boricua65,2012-08-29T04:56Z,"Thank you.  I will seed as much as possible.  Followed your instructions and worked like a champ.  Again, thank you WarmongerTM. :-D"
,capomic,2012-08-29T14:43Z,Did I do any steps wrong? The 30 days remaining popup is still here after I patched the dll file...
,CREAM623,2012-09-01T08:43Z,"okay so i've downloaded torrent, extracted photoshop_13 file, dowloaded trial via Set-up under extracted folder. Continued to open, then close program, have gone as far as pasting crack file into each individual file and folder of Adobe under Program Files and Program Files(x86), and still, the trial box continues to appear when i open Photoshop. 
Have tried alternatives from others advice but still no luck.
HELP PLEASE! perhaps very detailed instructions, for a machine using Windows 7 64bit.
Thank you!"
,Zovereign,2012-09-15T04:54Z,Are you sure this is EXTENDED? 
,Zovereign,2012-09-15T05:50Z,"okay, sry, it's EXTENDED! :P"
