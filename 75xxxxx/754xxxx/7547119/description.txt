I prefer to utilize these books as image files, so I left them that way. If you want to make them into a pdf file and reupload, GO FOR IT! :D

-A Quick Note About the Computones Volumes- 
There were a lot of repeated pages (mostly technical/troubleshooting stuff) throughout this series. 
Any pages that were included in a previous volume have been omitted (to save on scanning/editing time). 
So, make sure to grab the first volume if you want to look through that stuff. 
Also: I was able to get the Computones software to work with GIMP 2.6 using the PSPI plugin. Haven't tried with the latest versions though. 
I remember trying to get it to work in Photoshop CS5 and it didn't work--so your best bet is GIMP or an earlier, supported version of Photoshop.
