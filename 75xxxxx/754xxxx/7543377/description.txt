 County RecordsΓÇÖ classic 3-LP set devoted to the music of the Ozark's has been beautifully redone on these two CDs. Not only has the sound quality been dramatically improved by the exquisite re-mastering of Rich Nevins, but more great material has been added, featuring such intriguing artists as the Grinnell Giggers, and Hinman & Sharp. There is a wealth here of some of the loveliest and most distinctive rural music ever put on record. Suffice it to say any fan of old-time music will find much to enjoy in this wonderful collection.
