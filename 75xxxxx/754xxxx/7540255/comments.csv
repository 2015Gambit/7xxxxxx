,ImTooBaked,2012-08-30T16:23Z,"Hey man I have one file that isnt there after I copy all the files from skidrow file into the setup. There is no setup-1a.bin but there is setup-1b.bin,c.bin, and d.bin. The computer cant find it when looking for the disc files in the sniper elite v2 folder. Therefore I can't start the game. Do you have a fix? Any help appreciated."
