I took two MP3 music collections and compiled this folder for a car show I hosted earlier this summer.


It consists of some of my favorite oldies, and what I thought I would like to hear while walking around at the car show.


Louder tracks have been leveled by mediamonkey for use on a PA sound system.

341 tracks total, there would have been more if I had more time.


ENJOY!
