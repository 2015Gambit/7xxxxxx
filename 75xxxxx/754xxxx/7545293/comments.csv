,sadsack_in_China,2012-09-01T15:48Z,If there is a problem with this torrent why is there still a seed showing? Shouldn't you delete this?
,cybergodsig,2012-09-02T02:30Z,"It won't let me delete torrents, I've tried."
,sadsack_in_China,2012-09-06T05:06Z,"Are you still trying to seed this? This shows one seed. The other torrent, (the new one) shows none. Are you trying to seed the wrong one?"
,sadsack_in_China,2012-09-08T04:57Z,"Don't waste time with this. This user doesn't complete his torrents. This can now be found here;

And it completes."
