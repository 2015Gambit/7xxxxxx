,Knottolf,2012-08-20T14:44Z,See subscene.com for synched and tested subtitles for this release. Should show up as soon as it has been approved. Works on 720p and most likely on the 1080 as well(?)
,wiron,2012-08-20T15:19Z,Thank You for such good quality uploads.

,wanderlustus,2012-08-22T18:02Z,"Ok.  It says ""2007"" but has the cover of Chris Rock's rip-off from 2010.  I'm giving this a shot, but can anyone confirm this is the 2007 Frank Oz original?  Cheers."
,wanderlustus,2012-08-22T19:15Z,"And I've got enough down to confirm, yes, it is the 2007.  Cheers, YFIY.  Love your work."
,DanielTurtleface,2012-09-03T06:07Z,It is playing 2 voices at a time >.
,PoyzinBl00d,2012-09-03T07:40Z,"Don't bother downloading. It's not even the right movie and on top of that it's just a directors commentary. Waste of time. If you can't upload the right thing, don't even bother uploading it at all. "
