"A Message for Japan"
June 17, 2011 Los Angeles



Bashar discussed what has recently occurred and how this experience can be utilized in positive and constructive ways to move toward the future you prefer. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the relief effort in Japan. Q&A Includes: What are the actual radiation levels in Japan? Can I shift to a reality where the Japan disaster has not happened? Are UFOs seen in Japan helping the radiation situation? Did the Japan disaster happen as a result of the "bad karma" of whaling? What are some other ways to solve the energy crisis and replace nuclear energy? How can I improve lucid dreaming? How can I find my true love? Will eating certain foods raise my vibration? Does there really have to be a limit to a physical lifetime? Is protest positive? A new perspective on animal suffering.
