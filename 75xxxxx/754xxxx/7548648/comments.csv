[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-08-25T08:00Z,"@CIA: yes, get Iplayer Automator is what I use. If you're in the UK, you just select the HD version in iPlayer, then 'use current page'. If not in the UK, invest a few quid in Netshade, and select a UK proxy server. I assume you're using a Mac...?"
[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-08-25T08:02Z,"Ah, sorry, missed the PC comment, CIA. Afraid I can't answer that one."
