Bruckner's Ninth Symphony, played by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under Georg Tintner on May 8-9, 1997. This recording contains three movements. What stands out at first here is the very fast tempo the scherzo is played at. I do not have access to a good scanner, so I apologize for the quality of the cover art.
