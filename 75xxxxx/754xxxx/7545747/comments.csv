,GanjaGuy420,2012-08-19T02:43Z,Been waiting for this all night. Can't wait to watch man thank you! PLEASE SEED PEOPLE!
,GanjaGuy420,2012-08-19T04:10Z,"Greedy bastards. I've been downloading this for over 2 hours and it's just halfway done. Every time I connect to a good seed, that person disconnects. "
,TorrentRating,2012-08-19T05:32Z,"Fantastic video quality! Once again you've come through here. For the file size, this the THE BEST version out now. Audio leaves something to be desired. For 1.4Gb this is a MUST DL torrent.

V=9
A=6
Real rating! Not the usual idiots who rate an obviously shitty release as a 10"
,Xorakka,2012-08-19T11:26Z,"V=9.5
A=8.5
M=100 (amazing movie)"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-08-19T18:10Z,"Seriously, there's like over 100 torrents for the same movie."
,737842,2012-08-19T18:31Z,Why do people post M:10 A:10 on YIFY uploads they are always the best quality torrents out

I do like gore and I do like sickness, but this went too quick and more information should had been added. A little disappointed. It had potential. "
,flyinbob,2012-08-21T16:26Z,"Excelent Quality. Although with some of your rips I keep finding myself having to max out the volume on my sound bar just to get it loud enough to have a good ""movie experience"" But thanks for your efforts!"
,firexninja,2012-08-22T19:53Z,thank you!
[V],spastik64,2012-08-26T18:41Z,"Low bluray quality rip, just for ppl who does not appreciate definition."
,maxwellsm,2012-09-07T18:24Z,Thanks YIFY.
,ChosenTorture,2012-09-09T01:39Z,"Who are you trying to fool ? Well apparently there are a lot of stupid fucks out here who think that this is actually a 1080p rip. Why don't you write the bitrate in the video stats ? Idiot. Your rips suck just like RiddlerA.
