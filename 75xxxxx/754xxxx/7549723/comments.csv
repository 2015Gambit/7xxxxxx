,callumshell1,2012-08-20T19:06Z,Why is it whenever I download from you I get 1kb/s? It's fine for all other torrents.
,SativaMeAt420,2012-08-20T21:03Z,"@callumshell1, are you checking the seeder/leecher ratios before you start your downloads? If there's more leechers than seeders the DL speed is going to be slow, also trying to download any show a mere couple hours after its been uploaded is never a good idea, you need to wait until more people finish the download so that they can seed, just FYI."
