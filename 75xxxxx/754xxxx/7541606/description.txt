The OneUps is (was?) a band that plays Jazz-themed covers of video game music.  They have multiple commercial CDs available, and have played shows across the U.S.

I received this small stack of CDs from a friend of a friend, and am now reposting online so it's not lost to time.  There are two live concerts - The OneUps BBQ2, and a live show at now-defunct JR's Lightbulb Club.  There are a handful of previously unreleased tunes in MP3 format, and there's a half-recorded WIP version of The OneUps Volume 2.

Lots of very rough, unpolished material here.  If the band allowed uploads to archive.org, that's a natural home for these.
