Two-part series which sees four Coronation Street stars take a break from the cobbles of Weatherfield to spread a life-saving message in Africa. Actors Sue Cleaver (Eileen Grimshaw), Ryan Thomas (Jason Grimshaw), Brooke Vincent (Sophie Webster) and Ben Price (Nick Tilsley) travel to Kenya on a mission to put on a play with the aim of educating people about the dangers of HIV. Working with a local charity and using their soap experience the four have just two weeks to recruit actors, rehearse and perform their new soap-inspired work. In a country where over 70,000 people lose their lives to the disease every year the pressure is on to draw in the crowds and leave the audience with a life-changing message.
