Description:
We have a lot of work! It is necessary to transform a quiet and comfortable town into a modern metropolis, not inferior to the world's largest capitals. You will have to follow the instructions of officials and execute queries picky locals. Why you? Because no one else can build a whole city in a short time with a modest budget and the draconian inspection requirements of the courts. Be prepared to think creatively, working on drawings and design projects: In this game you're a manager, architect and designer at the same time!
