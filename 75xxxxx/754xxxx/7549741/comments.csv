The torrent you link is the 2012.30 release.

This is the 2013.20 released from Garmin less of a week ago.

,Ackcomm1,2012-08-24T23:17Z,"VIRUS WARNING - Thsi download includes Garmin's Basecamp. Basecamp is a free download from Garmin. The ""patched"" basecamp.exe file contains a virus. The remaing files appear to be okay."
,SerSpec-V,2012-08-25T03:22Z,Virus according to what program? AVG???
,SerSpec-V,2012-08-25T03:51Z,Avast Pro says all files are clean. Ignore Ackcomm1.
,SerSpec-V,2012-08-25T05:35Z,Ipmark: Please upload 2013.20 that has the CNNANT2013_20Update.msi installer with Mapinstall like you did for 2013.10 so I can make custom maps. 
,copgoat,2012-08-27T00:56Z,"Hi, Really appreciate your uploads. One question, how can this be used with Base Camp on a Mac?"
,devo2310,2012-08-29T02:41Z,Just curious how to install on garmin nuvi 265w having trouble? 
,Ipmark,2012-08-29T14:57Z,"@SerSpec-V
For some unknow reason the unlocker corrupt the files in .gmap folder so it's impossible to create a working Unlocked Mapsource Version (ATM).
A possible workaround is to install a locked MV, unlock the map in Mapsource with a generic code for MapID 2689 (USV99V54XC8NGYL7BNK2A7388), make a custom map, send it to a PC folder and then unlock it with gimgunlock.exe

@copgoat
Unrar one map in a USB drive (Garmin folder).
Start BaseCamp with the USB drive plugged in the PC.

@evo2310
Unrar one map in a SD (Garmin folder).
That's all."
,Puterman,2012-08-31T14:27Z,"Thank You Ipmark......
For all your hard work on these updates.
It is greatly appreciated!!"
,SerSpec-V,2012-09-01T01:33Z,Never mind I downloaded 2013.20 from another forum that has the update.msi so now I have made custom maps with mapsource.
,spyder1331,2012-09-01T07:21Z,Ipmark  sorry it's the 250w   thanks again spyder1331
,Ipmark,2012-09-02T00:40Z,"@spyder1331

Unrar one map and copy it on the Garmin folder of a FAT32 formatted SD"
