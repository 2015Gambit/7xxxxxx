,Venturai,2012-08-19T03:49Z,"No problems here, appeared to be working nicely using either Potplayer or MPC-HC. Thanks!"
,MadMedicJim,2012-08-19T03:56Z,thanks for the news on its working.  I figured people would only want subs for those 2 scenes.  I will look more closely at the file name in the future!

Thanks!"
