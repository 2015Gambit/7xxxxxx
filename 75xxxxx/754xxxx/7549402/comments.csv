,haveabongbru,2012-08-20T05:46Z,"@Luebig17
Why would goldberg have came out and helped??"
,A7X050393,2012-08-20T05:47Z,"@ luebig17 Can you do the world a favor and NOT post the results in the comment section? Dickhead...

Thanks for the upload man, never disappoint"
,sumcoolguy,2012-08-20T06:13Z,"@luebig17 thanks for ruining the results for everyone.

Thanks for the upload as always"
,Josh-rko,2012-08-20T06:15Z,Really wish fuckwits wouldn't say who wins a match.
,.Leto.,2012-08-20T06:18Z,"lol, it's wwe, why would you care about spoilers? you know this isn't real, right?
thanks for the upload."
,sahilrox,2012-08-20T06:29Z,@scene pls delete the spoiler... :(
,sahilrox,2012-08-20T06:46Z,@Leto Really? Would you really watch a match knowing who won or not knowing? Stop taking the side of that idiot.......
,harshads,2012-08-20T06:46Z,Thanx bro !!
,fake.profile1234,2012-08-20T06:55Z,MOTHERFUCKERS! DON'T POST MATCH RESULTS!!! SON OF BITCHES!!! :-@
,.Leto.,2012-08-20T07:07Z,"Just ignore those spoilers, you don't even know if they're true. Funny thing though, in the SDH 5.7GB release you can guess with the screenshot who won the Lesnar/HHH fight and see how long it lasted. That uploader is a pure genius, posting spoilers on his own release :D"
,ekkamina,2012-08-20T07:13Z,shit delete his comment please :( now no fun watching hhh vs brock :(
,34955368,2012-08-20T07:52Z,They have to wheel chair Goldberg out to the ring  he was overrated. look Brock is a Beast 
,BruceWayneJr,2012-08-20T09:03Z,The ONLY reason I'm watching this is because I know HHH did the job. 
,ddonindia,2012-08-20T09:19Z,@luebig17 shutup !!!!  why the hell you are saying there results... F**K
,expand3r,2012-08-20T09:53Z,seed mother fuckers!!!!
,P.B.R.,2012-08-20T09:55Z,"Thank you scene, can you delete the dumbass comment giving the result ? Thanks again you are #1 !!!"
,ISStl,2012-08-20T10:49Z,You've to use better compression methods. Its better lower than 1 GB.
,A7X050393,2012-08-20T11:11Z,"Just finished downloading... very high quality video & Sound!

,.Leto.,2012-08-20T13:25Z,"Picture quality is only good at the original size, 720x402. At 150% size it's decent, at 200% it's too pixaleted. Full screen on a 22"" monitor it's horrible. I'm getting the SDH 720p release instead."
,LegoLazze,2012-08-20T13:56Z,".Leto

Cheers!"
,.Leto.,2012-08-20T23:24Z,"@ crab2cool: blood? what blood?? they ruined the wwe when they decided to turn it into a show for 10-year-old kids. and if it's scripted it means the result is decided before the match. the ""winner"" didn't actually win anything, he didn't deserve anything. so why the hell would you care who wins or loses? ignore the spoilers, just watch the fight."
,cbc9797,2012-08-21T00:23Z,Great upload! Thanks scene4all you are amazing.
,mentallyours,2012-08-21T03:07Z,?

,Dwch,2012-08-23T10:06Z,"Not sure why there was no RUDOS release this time around... but if you were a RUDOS addict like me, the KYR release is probably the one you're looking for."
