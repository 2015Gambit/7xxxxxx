,g8aso,2012-08-19T13:21Z,"The ID3 data says it was made using a 14 day trial of an ""Audio Transcoder""?  So the chances of it being transcoded are above 99%, agreed?

,cybergodsig,2012-08-19T21:53Z,help me seed this holy grail version of this album
,cybergodsig,2012-08-20T01:33Z,"Quit hating, everthing I put up is top notch quality."
,cybergodsig,2012-08-20T01:35Z,Anything I converted was an Ape file to FLAC thats it.
,cybergodsig,2012-08-20T01:46Z,This is the bottom line does this sound alot better than any Who's Next cd you have?  I know it does because I've listened to probably every pressing and this one always comes in first.
,tverlaine,2012-08-21T17:37Z,"Your right,it is a great version of this album,but it was not mastered by Steve Hoffman."
,cybergodsig,2012-08-29T20:26Z,"It was remastered by Hoffman, it was uncredited when he worked at MCA.  Check out his website and you'll see."
,tverlaine,2012-09-04T18:08Z," Also, keep in mind Steve's master is NOT used on any of the following versions: Germany Polydor, !""MCA gold""!, MCA/Polydor remix/remaster with bonus tracks, MFSL gold with bonus tracks."
