Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 16 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,hotnutz,2012-08-18T05:27Z,"Hey babybluetits,if i wanted to be lectured i would go to a different site,perhaps check one out on youtube,but not here.i appreciate anything you have done to help the PB but i have never seen your name on any torrents i've downloaded.so how do i know you have done your part.maybe your part is to hit and run.maybe you do your part from on your knees.just saying though,anybody that doesnt seed at a decent ratio isnt going to start now because you said so,and by the way,if this film is spoken in turkish,who the fuck wants this sshit anyway.thats why no one is seeding."

,theurgy,2012-08-27T08:14Z,"The included English subtitles are unintelligible fucking garbage. Allow me to quote:

""many twins born horses, ground 
have yielded abundant ... bear much fruit trees. 
But Chief Vizier Halil Pasha , which consent padaTentara Cross Before the parade fell into 
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
my hands, a letter to Orhan
Ibrahim, read!
I was surprised by the sentence to Orhan Ibrahim.
Chief Vizier Halil Pasha also with me.""

...what the fuck? What the actual fuck? I don't speak any Turkish but I understood more just listening than reading the tard-o-vision subtitles.

It really ruins the movie. It's a shame, because the movie looks pretty good. I haven't found well-translated subtitles for this film yet on sites such as opensubtitles.org and podnapisi. "
