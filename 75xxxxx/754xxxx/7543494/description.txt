Synopsis:
Ek Cup Chya (English: A Cup of Tea) is a Marathi film based on the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The film was the second project of activist producer Yeshwant Oak. Previously he had collaborated with the same directors Sumitra Bhave and Sunil Sukhtankar to produce Devrai in 2004 (an equally acclaimed film to create awareness about schizophrenia).

Plot:
Kashinath Sawant, a State Transport bus conductor from a village in coastal part of Maharashtra lives with his family-- wife Rukmini, old mother, two daughters Vasanti and Vanadevi and two sons Chandan and Abeer. The Sawant family suddenly is wrongly slammed with a huge electricity bill. They feel trapped by the circumstances and humiliated by the indifferent
bureaucracy. The saving grace is their sense of humour and warmth of familial bond. The Right to Information Act accidentally crosses Kashinaths path. With the support of his driver friend Saiyyad and under the guidance of activist Dr.Durga Kashinath and family regain their honour.
