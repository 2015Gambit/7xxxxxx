,rcr29budcar,2012-08-18T16:38Z,"I appreciate all the uploads that the skulls bring us, but whats funny to me is that they upload the best copy of Dark Knight Rises that they can get, which is a cam. Of course its gonna be bootleg cam quality.  Since its not bluray quality, all you see posted are complaints and people flaming the same uploaders that we have bringing us this dvd rip of Avengers.  Its the same thing over and over, calling the uploaders all sorts of names for uploading the same copy multiple times! Thats kind of ironic, because I see this movie multiple times, and it'll be uploaded dozens more by tonight, but no complaints, only thanks! I know the first thing i'll see is some smart ass saying how bad the copy was, trying to justify it.  The way things are today, that was a good copy.  I could see what was happening and it had good audio.  You hardly see screeners or leaks anymore.  The movie industry has tightened down with law enforcement, so mostly all you see are cams, so by those standards, it was a good upload.  My point is that I find it very ironic and kind of ignorant that some, not all, but some of the same people giving praise for this one, which has the same copy uploaded over and over, are the same people who were cursing these same uploaders for that movie! Why aren't you cursing the uploaders for putting this one up so many times?  And because this one is a dvd rip, is not a valid excuse!  Just needed to get that off my chest.  That is certainly not meant for all of you.  If it was meant for you, you know who you are.  I think I already said it once, but a big thanks for this upload, and thanks to all the uploaders for all the great movies they keep bringing us.  Peace! I'm out!"

WTF are you complaining about?
Is it because nobody has complained about this torrent??REALLY????
Complaining because nobody has complained has to be a new 1, grow up!!!!"
,tilapia,2012-08-18T20:47Z,"Quality - DvDrip   : )
Thanks"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-18T21:11Z,"It sounds fine on the TV, but when I listen with earbuds there are faint ""clicks"" in the sound in many scenes. It could just be my earbuds, but other movies and music don't have this. Then again I only plan to watch it on my TV so I guess it isn't really a problem.

Thanks scene4all! Been waiting on this since I went to see it."
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-18T21:17Z,Now that I noticed the clicking in the earbuds I keep noticing it through my sound system speakers. Still a great copy though.
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-18T21:23Z,"My comment disappeared (I guess you can't be honest about flaws now?), so if it reappears, sorry to repeat myself.

It's a great rip except the sound has audible background noise, I guess you'd call them clicks. They're VERY VERY faint, but they're there and once you notice them, it's hard to ignore them.

V: 9
A: 8

Thanks scene4all!"

,sonny1960,2012-08-19T04:52Z,Thankyou for the effort
,Irishbeast,2012-08-19T06:12Z,Did anyone else not have sound on the sample. I didn't when I Dl'd the sample so I am debating on whether or not I should get the complete movie. I do not wanna take the time to get it and be disappointed if there is no sound. Thanks for any input.
,dedalous,2012-08-19T11:47Z,Wow  ! Thanks for the torrent scene4all you are the best!
,FriendlySpidey,2012-08-19T12:58Z,"Irishbeast

Do you really think there'd be 10,000+ Seeders for a torrent with no sound. Check your codecs or get a better media player."
,kurkudjikul666,2012-08-19T14:53Z,Sample file doesn't have audio?
,H6imdall,2012-08-20T23:44Z,Thx
