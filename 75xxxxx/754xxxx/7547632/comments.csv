the game works fine. LMAO at retards saying Daemon Tools wont run nor will anything else. Morons man stfu....just because you dont know how to click the setup icon doesnt mean their is a problem with the torrent. 

Also, the setup shows 1 lousy word in Russian...idk if its even russian. Its some other text, but its one word during setup. After that its all english

As for the torrent. its 1.3, not 1.4....you simply click setup and install the game, then run the game and play it....no other fucking around at all. 

im running it on Extreme with no problems. Thanks azaq318"
,Maynard46,2012-08-20T05:34Z,"OMG...the reason you see english subs is because the game in played in Hong Kong....so they have people speaking their language and when they do, you see the english subs....god dam people are dumb fucks.

so i'm happy that skidrow, reloaded, FLT,.. didnt make a scene release for this so ppl would go and buy it.

oh i see, sorry bro, you are left with only one option, i tried it with steam and worked with other games.

1. Download this version.
2. Delete the game downloaded from steam (NOt manual download, but from steam itself).
3. Copy this one to the folder that steam created when downloading the original game, if you cant memorize the folder, start downloading the game from steam, then quit it after downloading 1 MB, it will create the folder again.
4. Download it again from steam.

Now steam will just replace the only updated files. so the download wont take 1-5 mins max. and you will be able to have all DLCs."

Any chances of uploading DLC only in the near future for people that already have the game?"
,CptSimon,2012-08-21T20:29Z,I heard this torrent has Russian voice and English subtitles. Is this true? I need to play the game fully English. Please tell me before I download this torrent.
,Xazbot,2012-08-21T22:51Z,"@CptSimon you ""need"" ???
No the game is in fully in english."
,CptSimon,2012-08-21T23:28Z,"@Xazbot, Yes I NEED to play the game in full English. I don't really care about different language subs, but any language other than English in voice would ruin my playing experience and I'd download another torrent instantly. Thanks for letting me know anyway."

The game runs very fine. For all the retards that said the game is in Russian with English subs, I hope you die. You're a stupid motherfucker the people in the game speak Chinese that's why there are English subs."

It says 1.3 but it is still 1.4. The newest 3DM crack fix changes that. Maybe if you weren't such a complete fucking noob you'd do your research iGaynade."

,WoYa,2012-08-22T22:27Z,"FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE WHITE SCREEN PROBLEM:Apparently it is because you don't have windows installed on the C: drive.

Here's the solution for it:

There is a way to run it if you have Windows is not on drive C:
Download the file that corresponds to your install location for Sleeping Dogs :

rghost(.)ru_/_39910276 if windows is in D:
rghost(.)ru _/_39910718 if windows is in E:
rghost(.)ru _/_39909929 if windows is in G:

Just extract and then copy the files in game directory. Found this guide somewhere, worked for me, just passing it along so people can solve their problem with the game."
