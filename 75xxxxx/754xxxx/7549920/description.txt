DevForce Data Services fills a gap in the application infrastructure stack between where your Data Access Layer (DAL) ends and your client application begins. The gap concerns your ΓÇ£business logic layerΓÇ¥. How your raw data become business objects with behavior, logic, and rules. How your business objects traverse tiers and cross the network ΓÇª securely and reliably. How you query for them with LINQ and save changes transactionally. How you do all of this at scale and with maximum performance. DevForce Data Services fills this gap so you donΓÇÖt have to reinvent it, cobble it, maintain it, and defend it. WeΓÇÖve got eight years of tough customer experience, with production applications in the field spanning the spectrum of .NET client technologies: WinForms, ASP.NET, WPF, and now Silverlight.
