,EngieR,2012-08-20T17:20Z,"hi eztv, thanks for ur torrents, but I am now downloading this for the 3rd time, the other 2 were unplayable, if this attempt fails will not be overly pleased as i have a very limited GB allowance per month, but all other torrents i have gotten from you have been good..luck of the draw I suppose"

,Tanlic,2012-08-20T19:03Z,"Engie old son your going to feel a bit silly when you read this but we've all been there :0) Go to one of the 3 files you have downloaded it right click and rename it to Falling Skies.avi and then it will play. It's not playable in it's present form for obvious reasons ;0) Have a great day.

Thanks EZTV top notch upload as usual."
