Translated and adapted from the label's web site:

"This has definitely one of the most important places on
Refuse Records. Quite the premiere material, the third big
disc from this Portuguese, political genius, Vegan Straight
Edge crew. Stylistically rooted in the tradition of old-
school melodic bands, but extending far beyond the
stylistic conventions. Endearing music, endearing lyrics,
and unique to this thing called 'the modern HC' is a 170-
page book attached to the disc, with lyrics, band comments,
articles, lots of information on political prisoners,
useful addresses... This makes the whole publishing unique
and special."

Tracks 1 and 6 are untitled on the album, so I went with
what the grabber pulled off its online DB, which I thought
made sense. Track 16's title has a typo ("Giulliani") on
the back cover; it's correctly written everywhere else.
Track 17's title is mentioned on the inside of the digipak
and in the book that came with the CD.
