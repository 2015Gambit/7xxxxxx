I guess my timing is getting better...you'd only upped this 9 minutes before I grabbed it :-)
I'm hoping seeders will show up this weekend for the 4.15 GiB version....I'll burn that, but cannot wait to watch it, so thanks again.  Of course I'll seed both - and I'll talk with you elsewhere.
Love Ya,
MuUr"
