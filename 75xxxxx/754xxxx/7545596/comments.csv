,Taosinky,2012-08-19T04:19Z,"Hum i had tested this one during 45 minutes.

No Freezing, no lagging, no stuttering.

1080p - Max - 55/60 FPS... so, this crack seams to be the good one. (better than previous, that's for sure)"
,albo88,2012-08-19T05:03Z,"@MacScoots crack was posted by a user called  lazarusproject yet he didn't made it and dint give any credit on its post so i did the same

,baitmain,2012-08-19T20:47Z,"I just have to ask, are there no spider icons to take pictures of? Or is there another way to unlock the costumes on PC?"
,MousE0910,2012-08-19T21:17Z,"@baitmain Yes, apparently in the PC version you can unlock costumes by doing side-missions and progressing through the story instead of locating emblems."
