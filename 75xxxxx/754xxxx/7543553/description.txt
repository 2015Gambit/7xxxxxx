please, seed it for a while and add trackers (simply copy and paste it) from my latest torrents (old ones may not work).

I do not have files locally since my HDD crash in 2011 and I am waiting for so long for seeders (am not alone on some).
As usual, unblock my OVH based server (by some PeerBlock list or some defective ipfilter list).

Thank you.
