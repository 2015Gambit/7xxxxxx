***This show most likely came from Wilker since most of my WSP shows on 
my hard drive have his text info.  However, I can't be 100% sure since
no torrent I saw on etree exactly matched perfectly (specifically not 
mentioning the 'Tuning' before set 2 and thetime length
of each track).  Nonetheless, it sounds AWESOME.  
100% sure.  Also, I listed them by SETLIST, not DISKS since we're going
away from CD's these days.
