 Being connected to Daemon Black sucksΓÇª Thanks to his alien mojo, DaemonΓÇÖs determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection. So IΓÇÖve sworn him off, even though heΓÇÖs running more hot than cold these days. But weΓÇÖve got bigger problems. Something worse than the Arum has come to townΓÇª The Department of Defense are here. If they ever find out what Daemon can do and that we're linked, IΓÇÖm a goner. So is he. And there's this new boy in school whoΓÇÖs got a secret of his own. He knows whatΓÇÖs happened to me and he can help, but to do so, I have to lie to Daemon and stay away from him. Like that's possible. Against all common sense, I'm falling for Daemon. Hard. But then everything changesΓÇª IΓÇÖve seen someone who shouldnΓÇÖt be alive. And I have to tell Daemon, even though I know heΓÇÖs never going to stop searching until he gets the truth. What happened to his brother? Who betrayed him? And what does the DOD want from themΓÇöfrom me? No one is who they seem. And not everyone will survive the liesΓÇª
