I've just learned how to figure subrip technology, and I'm celebrating by uploading this. Le Piege (trap) d'Issoudun is about a policeman who becomes involved with a troubled woman after she tries to commit suicide on the highway, the then gets in deeper than he had foreseen. The thing is filled with delightful classical references, and closes with a rendition of Dido's Lament (Purcell) which is worth the price of admission.

Please let me know if the subtitles re successful, it's my first effort.
