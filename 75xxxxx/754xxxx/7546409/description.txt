For five days in the summer of 1957, folklorist Edith Fowke recorded over eighty songs performed by O. J. Abbott, an octogenarian native of Ottawa. Mr. AbbottΓÇÖs songs reflect influences from Ireland, England, and Scotland, with lyrics that relate swashbuckling pirate tales and mournful ballads of love lost. Liner notes include a personal account of Ms. FowkeΓÇÖs experience working with Mr. Abbott, a brief autobiography from the performer, and descriptions with lyrics for each track. Enjoy, and please seed!
