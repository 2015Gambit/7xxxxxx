Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate| 1998 |Hrishida Comedy|Hindi DVDRip|Phantom

Plot:
Anand(Anil Kapoor), an actor of sorts, loves Urmila(Juhi Chawla), but since Urmila is the daughter of a conservative and orthodox retired police officer Abhayankar (Amrish Puri), it'll take a lot for Shankar to win over the Abhayankar family. Shankar then begins to create a series of lies (hence the title, when he lies, the crow caws) in attempting to get the one he loves.

The movie was the last movie of the legend Hrishikesh Mukherjee.
