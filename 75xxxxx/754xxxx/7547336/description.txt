Corb Lund Losin' Lately Gambler on LP

Corb Lund's New West Records debut LosinΓÇÖ Lately Gambler is propelled by a galloping stand-up bass, electric guitar and is set to the roots-country singer/songwriter's Jack London-esque yarns about down-and-out cowboys, whiskey and ranching. Raised in rural Southern Alberta, Canada, he has been singing about his country upbringing for more than a decade on critically acclaimed albums such as Five Dollar Bill (2002) and Hair In My Eyes Like A Highland Steer (2005). Lund is the current Canadian Country Music Association's Roots Artist of the Year for the fifth consecutive year and has won countless Western Canadian Music Awards, Canadian Folk Music Awards and both Canadian and U.S. Independent Music Awards.
