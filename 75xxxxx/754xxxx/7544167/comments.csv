I havent test it but you can try with the galaxy s2 apk."

I did try it. The graphics are misplaced and the controls in the middle of the screen. I think the resolution is not optimized for the 1280x720 screen of the S3. Thank you anyway."

Try the xoom apk.It has 720p resolution as s3.It must work."
,fallenraven86,2012-08-24T21:49Z,xoom apk works great! Thank you so much!
,fallenraven86,2012-09-01T16:32Z,I'd like to make a request. I'm in final year of med school so I would really appreciate it if you could upload some medical apps please. Thank you so much. :)
