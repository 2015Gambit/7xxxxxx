Eerie, forbidding, and darkly beautiful - Okefenokee is ruled by a descendant of the dinosaur, the fearsome alligator. Day and night the alligator glides silently through its steamy realm, stony eyes just above the waterline, mouth held in a seemingly perpetual smile. Join scientists as they study the behavior of these huge and powerful reptiles in REALM OFTHE ALLIGATOR.
