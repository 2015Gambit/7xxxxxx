Bloc Party-Four-2012-FNT

Bloc Party will release their first new album in four years, entitled FOUR, on August 21st via Frenchkiss Records. Produced by Alex Newport (The Mars Volta, AtTheDrive-In, Polysics), the album was recorded and mixed in New York City, and is the bandΓÇÖs first full-length since 2008s acclaimed Intimacy. Along with this exciting news, the band have announced a string of European, U.S. and festival appearances following a two year absence from the stage, which will give fans the first opportunity to hear new material from their forthcoming album, as well as classic tracks from the bandΓÇÖs ten year history. The overwhelming demand for the 
band has resulted in sold out shows across the globe. Bloc Party has released three full length albums, including their Mercury Prize nominated debut, Silent Alarm, helping to shape the sound of modern British guitar music.
