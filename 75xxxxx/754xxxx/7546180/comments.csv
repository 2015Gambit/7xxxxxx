The MOST those extra files would take up 1 MB per CD, amounting to less than half a gig for 500 albums.

I didn't used to care about cue files and still don't care about logs or analyzer files, but now I sometimes use cues when converting, so I save them.
Even if I don't need them, the next person might."
