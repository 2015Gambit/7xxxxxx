Notes: Ok took the italian video ...cleaned it up some,there was loads of camera
movement all over the place so cut into several parts and pull and cropped the
borders the best we could Also changed the normal stuff ...contrast,colours etc
The perspective goes off aswell as the AR due too the movement but we wanted too
crop as little as poss Video also missing a little over 2mins

Audio was nice but contained alot of noise,which we cleaned then syncd too our
encode

Ps ...we dedot when asked,but considering you left some in yourself i'd look in
the mirror first and call yourself a ****,then go back and check your " the
watch " aswell
