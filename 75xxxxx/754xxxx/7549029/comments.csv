""

Why don;t you just shut up and go back and learn what these stats actually mean !!! --- With a new torrent you are always going to have several times more leachers than seeders --- THAT DOESN""T MEAN SHIT -- Anyone downloading this is considered a leach whether they are uploading pieces or not they will not be considered a seed until they have 100% of this torrent - so it has nothing to do with the speed of the torrent or how much people are uploading --- So before you go around acting like an ass at least learn what you are crying about -- It is not the seeders to leachers stats it is the speed that both those seeders are leachers are sharing at !!!"
,JDFan,2012-08-20T21:36Z,"@cjlamar966  -- A seeder is someone that has completed the download and keeps sharing the torrent (so is only uploading) -- a Leach is anyone else (whether they are downloading and uploading or opnly downloading) -- the thing is many idiots do not realize this and think that a leach is someone that is only downloading and a seed is anyone that is uploading -- thus the bitch and moan about the lack of seeds --- they do not realize that with torrents as long as someone has not set their upload speed to a minimum all leaches are also sharing they just do not have the entire torrent yet.

So anyone that is bitching and moaning about ""SEEDING"" does not understand how torrents work and should just be ignored like all the other spam posts for direct downloads from their pay website."

We have just landed on Mars and we are currently finding out if life does or ever existed there. AND, we make kick ass films that the world loves to watch! You can be a hater, that's okay. Is it wrong to strive to be the best at everything you do? Your socialist politicians would have you think so. Because we have kicked ass for so song, the world has become more competitive and strives to be like American's. You want an example? Look at the world when it comes to basketball. In 1992, we kicked everyone's asses. In 04 we took bronze and now the world has become better, making the United States better because it forced the team to work harder. End result, two consecutive golds in basketball. Instead of crying about how much you hate us, get off your ass and make a difference! "

I am the same vintage of most of the senior actors in this movie.  As individual action movie stars I have enjoyed so many of their movies in years past.  I don't pretend to be capable of matching their action, but did retire just recently from an active 40 year career in law enforcement.  The actors in this movie that I remember best from their numerous movies are, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, and Chuck Norris.  My hat goes off to Sylvester Stallone for completing this movie despite the severe pain he feels in the recent loss of his son.  Yes Arnold you are back.  Will you also be back in politics at some time?  All good."
,libertaswv,2012-08-27T23:55Z,"@ elitecrusher: A copy and paste campaign? THAT'S your big political effort? For Ron Paul?? I laugh, ruefully, in your general direction. 

'Mr.Freedom' who wants to legislate his religion and force women to become incubators for the state. No autonomy over their own bodies for women.... LGBT citizens denied the rights of other citizens because of his bigoted religion.... Yeah, he's SO ""freedom"" minded. He's a religious, racist, authoritarian nut, just like the rest of the American Right. Just like you.

Here's a clue, genius. The legal principles he advocates are antithetical to anything resembling individual freedom. If, as Paul repeatedly advocates, the government is granted the power to force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term - then the government can tell YOU what to do with YOUR body. Understand? It's not so cool when they aren't just telling women what to do, is it? I'm knocking on your skull, ""elitecrusher"" - anybody in there? 

As far as the 'liberal media' nonsense idiots like you are so fond of railing against... Do tell, exactly how does the logic track that giant multinational media corporations secretly support the ideology most likely to cost their shareholders money? Why do giant, multinational media corporations secretly support the party that is most likely to reregulate their industry? In case you haven't guessed: They don't. The media support the wealthy class that own them, plain and simple.

From beginning to end, the only thing your comments make clear is your total ignorance about the subjects that so twist your emotional knickers.

I think it would be swell if people stuck to quality ratings, subtitle info, and maybe a spoiler-free review or 2 - but they don't. Right wingers start this political shit, not lefties. Look for yourself. If no one says anything back to them, tpb becomes a defacto platform for right wing, anti-internet, authoritarian politicians. Less informed people might take silence as implied agreement or approval. While all politicos serve the same masters in a capitalist society, they aren't all the same on a practical level. It is the right that goes after the net with the most fervor for restrictive legislation. Speaking for myself, seeing tpb laden with comments supporting politicians (like ron/rand paul) whose policy goals are antithetical to a free and open internet makes me want to puke.

Fuck these guys, and fuck their bullshit anti-torrent comments. 

Hopefully for the last time: Sincerely sorry, scene4all / everyone here for ratings.

@ heysiggy: Do a search specific to your ISP. You'll probably find info that speaks directly to your situation. My guess is a) the letter won't come to anything at this point... People get 'em all the time. b) you need to mask your identity. Start here:

,libertaswv,2012-09-03T05:26Z,"@ Heysiggy: Definitely do not wipe/dump your drives. The information they need for their case exists at the server - dumping anything on your end will only hurt you without addressing the problem. You've already been tagged - but i don't think it will matter.

Honestly bro/sister, i think you're fine. What they've been doing is sending out intimidating letters to everyone that seeds the files they claim as their property (how something that doesn't exist can be called property, i don't know.... If you're at work and i sneak over and use your lawn mower, putting it back with a full tank of gas when i finish - have i 'stolen' anything? I don't think so either. If there is absolutely no chance they'd be getting my money in a retail setting - What on earth have they lost? Nothing.). They've been selecting a small handful of the (generally) most prolific sharers, and they take them to court. Recently, they've had their lackeys working on a new plan... The ""6 Strikes"" plan. Meaning, after getting caught 6 times you're booted from the net, or at least your isp, and possibly prosecuted. In anticipation of this new policy, they suspended their expensive and pointless legal actions against individual seeders. Recently, they ran into problems regarding the wording of the policy and the exact legal definitions of the files in question, etc (so they said... I think it has more to do with people finally recognizing that the legal ramifications of this shit are vast and would apply to a broad spectrum of other things, but that's just my opinion, as far as i actually know).

Hopefully that all made sense, lol. Keep checking torrentfreak (and always check the informative/cathartic comments as well) for current information. They're a great outfit.... Well informed and scene-loyal.

Remember that the isp's are happily cooperating with the copyright holders; they aren't sending these letters on their own initiative. They bust people that share - not people that download (lately, anyway. I was one of those that got letters from Metallica back in the napster days, the fuckin' cunts. LarsfuckingreedheadUlrich). If you still want to use bittorrent but feel guilty about not being able to contribute, you can always download UK shows, Canadian shows, Australian, etc... Those countries aren't monitoring US swarm participation. When you download, just check to see if it is an American for-profit corporation that claims ownership of the material; if it is... Skip it (or download it without sharing, but if you do that make sure you seed something safe for a longer period to try and balance the karmic scales)

I think you're fine, sincerely. Try not to worry, and don't let their intimidation tactics get to you. Information is free, and any attempt to control the flow harms us all - especially when in service of the profits of a greedy, power-mad ownership class. They cannot stop us - not now, not ever. Together we are impossible to defeat. Literally. 

Good luck!

I don't understand why you believe Ronnie would force women to keep their kids? His personal belief is pro-life, but if he were president he would actually get the federal government out of the whole abortion issue. He doesn't believe abortion is something the federal government should legislate; it should be decided at the state government level. So this means each state would decide on its own if it wants abortions to be legal or not. Could be illegal in TN but legal in CA. What's wrong with that? Why should the federal government have any say anyways? Just a bit confused where you read that he would force the whole country to be pro-life through the federal gov't."

I'm a bit confused why you believe Ronnie would force pro-life on the whole country? While his personal belief is pro-life, the actual gov't policy he wants to adopt would get the federal government out of the business of deciding whether abortion should be legal or not. He wants the state governments to decide that. So abortion could be legal in CA, but illegal in TN. What's wrong with that? I was just curious where you read that he wants to legislate abortion at the federal level, because in his interviews, debates and website he consistently says the opposite."

It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. I saw it on freefree.noahw.org they have great quality. I recommend the movie, a great one!"
