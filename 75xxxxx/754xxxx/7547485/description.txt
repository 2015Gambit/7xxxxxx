About the film: Documentary film "Jackass 3.5" - the continuation of the series, which began painting "Jackass," and talked about the performance of different humorous, sometimes very dangerous, samoistyazayuschih and sometimes just silly tricks performed by a team of enthusiasts. At this time - all once again, as before, and so much more. Even more outrageous stunts, jokes and even more massacres, including one significant clash of filmmakers Steve-O from the Cayman turtle and another participant Chris Pontius with his incredible forest woodpecker.
