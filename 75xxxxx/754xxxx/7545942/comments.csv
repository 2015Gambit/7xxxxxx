But i wish Yify could separate the new uploads from the old films, that way i won't have to search his profile DAILY... He uploads like 3-4 old films daily, mixed with the old, very easy for the new films to be buried....


Is there any means of separating the films by year that i don't know of? Thanks for all the work ,man!"

if it concerns you that much why don't you just sort downloads by the upload date. Then go through one page at a time, or all at once if you have the time, and make note of the movies you want. Or all the movies you don't have. Once you reach the most recent uploads, you'll know you sifted through everything and you'll only have to check the most recent page every couple days/weeks.

What do you expect YIFY to do? Delete all their torrents and re-upload them in chronological order every time they get a pre-2012 torrent????

I agree with Simon and his wife."
