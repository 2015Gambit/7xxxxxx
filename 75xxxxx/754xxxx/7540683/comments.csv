,Syndur2,2012-08-17T18:00Z,"""iNTERNAL"" is probably best described by starting with the other tags. Basically, ""scene"" releases follow the rule that there's just one release (for each category), so just one 720p version. No other release is permitted, UNLESS the release is broken -- in which case a ""repack"" is released by the same group, or a ""proper"" by another group.

""iNTERNAL"" is a release that doesn't qualify for any of the above: it's not the first one, and it's not a ""proper"". It might be better than the first one, but ""proper"" is only allowed for certain flaws, not general ""it's better"", so the release might not qualify as a ""proper"". Or it might not be better at all, hard to tell unless the nfo gives such information."
