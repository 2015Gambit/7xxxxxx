,5-click,2012-08-17T13:30Z,@Keka: DHT/PEX are parts of the BitTorrent-Protocol for trackerless torrents. They have nothing to do with TPB. You can see the stats of DHT/PEX in your client.  
,D0gmeat,2012-08-17T14:09Z,A number of big name ISPs are throttling bandwidth for torrents and you may belong to one of them or are downstream from them.
