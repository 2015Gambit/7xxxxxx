Description:
You play as Makoto, a student who never attends the lectures at the school. As a punishment, you have to attend an extra seminar on an island with other classmates. However, when you arrive on the island, strange things start happening. A girl is found dead on April 6th, with a small bell in her hand. Immediately after that, you found yourself in the bed and see the date - April 1st! Was the vision of the girl just a dream, or do you possess a power to predict events? This is what you will have to find out, as a series of strange deaths make your seminar much more suspenseful that you have thought. 


This comes with a full English patch.



Install instructions:

Might need Japanese locale set. (I was in it as usual)
Unrar everything.
Mount disc 1 and start the setup. (I think it was the second button from the top)
Mount disc 2 when prompted and continue.
Run the patch file and navigate to where you installed the game.
Extract either the psp or pc or even both sound packs to the folder where you installed the game. (psp music is higher quality though, also if using the psp music put the files in volume.zip directly in your never7 folder. Else they will drown out the voice acting.)
Put the three movies into a new folder named  "movie-en" in the Never7 folder. (End1.avi End2.avi and Opening.avi)
Run "Never7_English_OGG.exe" to start the game.
If it gives an error regarding "libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll" move the one included into the folder where the game is installed.
If not all letters are recognized by the game please use the supplied japanese.ttf font file.
While playing the game select the sound pack you want to use in the right click menu that open when you right click.


PS:I won't bother with a synopsis since VNDB has a good one on it anyway. But just take it from me that the Infinity series of novels never fail to impress me.
