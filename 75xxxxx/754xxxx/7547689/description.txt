The first edition of this book was originally designed to support the Continuing Medical EducationΓÇÖs courses offered through Michigan State University and its colleges of osteopathic medicine. Since that time, this publication has been used nationally and internationally in a number of colleges of osteopathic medicine,
chiropractic colleges, schools of physical therapy, and schools of massage therapy.

As a second year Family Medicine/Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine Resident, I had the privilege to shadow and treat patients with Dr Greenman in his clinic at Michigan State University. It was during these precious moments in his clinic when I began to recognize my role in facilitating oneΓÇÖs process toward improved function; this is the goal of the osteopathic manipulative
medicine treatment.

The fourth edition of GreenmanΓÇÖs Principles of Manual Medicine attempts to help the reader look beyond the general application and pursue the ΓÇ£howΓÇ¥ and the ΓÇ£whyΓÇ¥ technique can improve neuromusculoskeletal system function. The basic principles
are maintained and substantially referenced thanks in part to two major scientific contributors to our understanding of manual medicineΓÇôΓÇôthe First International Fascia Conference and Movement Stability & Low Back Pain: The Essential Role of the Pelvis, which originated out of two world congresses on low back and pelvic pain.
