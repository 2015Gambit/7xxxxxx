,sHINX17,2012-08-19T19:22Z,Thanks! i always wait for AviaRa's torrents.. seems like the the most reliable
,vekh,2012-08-19T19:25Z,"No offense but your DL would have been more useful if you packaged the game, the DLC, the patch, and the crack seperately. So people wouldn't have to download everything if they only lacked the DLC for example.
"
,peto9110,2012-08-19T19:31Z,thanks
[T],aviara,2012-08-19T19:56Z,I will do the update and dlc in a short time

,vekh,2012-08-19T22:27Z,>dat feel when upload is faster than download
,bcloudpht,2012-08-19T22:58Z,37 Seeders 791 Leechers...So frustrating @.@.....
,Jason310M,2012-08-19T23:55Z,Fucking have some patience people. What a bunch of ungrateful bitches. Give it some time the ratio will even out.
,dandalis,2012-08-19T23:57Z,does this includes working crack ?
,Dodge34,2012-08-20T07:17Z,"Need to know, does this one work out of the box and include everything (DLC, Patch, crack) don't want to waist 9,80GB of bandwith, where I am here this isn't unlimited so can't seed much if I don't want to pay the game 10x more in bandwith to my ISP than the actual price of the game."
,Kseon09,2012-08-20T09:59Z,please seed more !
,nightzhade92,2012-08-20T11:42Z,Getting a white window which the ndisappears on launch. beftg
,charsaur,2012-08-20T15:31Z,"somehow i only have that Just Cause DLC, and the game hangs just when you get to use the bike."
,sbuck333,2012-08-20T15:41Z,"Thanks very much aviara, nice clean package. Scans clean with MSE and MWB. Game is great, it looks fantastic and is really demanding at 2560 x 1440. If you are getting white screen I would recommend updating direct x and .net framework. I haven't got to the part on the bike yet though, we'll see what happens. "
,Dodge34,2012-08-20T19:38Z,"Works #1, except doesn't look like all the DLC are there, only the Just Cause 2 thing show up in the DLC menu.

I got a some kind old rig and game works #1, not with the extreme graphics (didn't try that I know I couldn't handle that) but with the following the game runs smooth :

Core2Quad Q9400 2.6GHZ
6GB DDR2 800 Corsair
PNY GeForce 9600GT 512MB DDR3
Windows 7 Ultimate 64bits.
Standard HD (will soon have a SSD)"
,Freeloaderp,2012-08-20T20:59Z,"The DLC is there. The Triad Enforcer pack doesn't show up, since it comes natively with every digital download of the game. If you check the installed files there are files that end with HD.big/.bix. The easiest way of checking if your HD texture pack is working and enabled is by looking at neon textures ingame, because there is a huge difference between low and high res. "
,yousaf72a,2012-08-20T23:35Z,"plz seed guys im stuck at 76% i already seeded 37gb come on now ,n if ur having an issue with the graphic options go here for solutionhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=32399198

,yousaf72a,2012-08-20T23:57Z,"come on seed ,increase your upload ratio it doesnt  effect your download speed"
,Zinuk,2012-08-21T00:24Z,Working ?
,ebongny,2012-08-21T03:35Z,"This torrent is legit and 100% working. The only thing is, its v1.3 not 1.4"
,syntank,2012-08-21T04:03Z,"God damn, the leechers are strong in this one. As a general rule guys, try to seed at least the size of the torrent after you download it! That's how p2p is supposed to work!"
,lenzel,2012-08-21T05:52Z,"Anyone else having a freeze problem? I run the game smoothly, but usually when I drive a car or get out a car, I freeze like 30 seconds in. I would have to end the process, but there's no error message.... I have recommended specs."
,charsaur,2012-08-21T07:42Z,"Yeah, I have issues playing the game now since it keeps crashing whenever I load a game or start a new game. Tried deleting and reinstalling a few times, still doesn't work."
,Jason310M,2012-08-21T16:55Z,"Installs fine, although it is not 1.4 it is 1.3. Says so right on the opening screen. Starts in windowed mode as well. I am running Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit."
,roy_pratik,2012-08-21T21:50Z,"Working fine till now,no crash no freeze.Thanks a lot."
,iGrenade,2012-08-22T03:13Z,"dickheads like you should be locked in solitary confinement for the rest of your life for lying due to personal greed. is it really that hard to be honest and not lie about this being 1.3 instead of 1.4?

you morons never learn until severe punishment strikes."
,qwak779,2012-08-22T21:42Z,"The game works and runs perfectly fine with me. It did say v1.3 but I DL's Skidrows 1.4 update and copied it to game directory. Working OK. 

Thanks to Aviara, good upload."
