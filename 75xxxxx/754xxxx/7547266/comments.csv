The video gets pretty choppy, too. (Tested with Quicktime and VLC players..same result)

Thanks to the uploader....but maybe fine-tune your compression/ripping skills  for future torrents?"
,QborT,2012-08-19T21:03Z,"The audio is atrocious.

EViLCREW sucks, you should just skip uploading their rips scene4all."
,Rush,2012-08-19T22:03Z,s4a bro..... sup with the audio? damn it's so bad I'm going to skip this entirely after trashing over 3GB of bandwidth (down and up) thanx for the effort but this just is beyond bad.

Audio is over volume and distorted but understandable, keep your speakers down.

,A_Dying_Baby,2012-08-20T04:19Z,"it keeps skipping 
i would look for another upload"
,taxentaxen,2012-08-20T19:30Z,"Of all Rousey.vs.Kaufman uploads, this is the only upload different from SecTPB's 5GB one. All other uploads are just re-encodings of SecTPB into different V/A quality. I downloaded both sources and made sure that all skippings happen at same positions. EViLCREW's encoding skill is not like some comments say. The skippings are original broadcaster's fault. Audio is little high tone I have agree. With all points in mind, there is no reason to avoid this release just because video skips. Other releases skip exactly the same way."
