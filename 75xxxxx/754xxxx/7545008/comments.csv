,bleslie1,2012-08-19T03:19Z,"hey, thanks very much, but i could only watch half the episode :(

the second half, the sound and video are way out of sync. any way you can repost? its fine if not, i can still watch it this way if i have to lol. 

have a great weekend! :)"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-19T12:57Z,So sorry...I had to get the episode from somewhere else this time...so something didn´t work out...really sorry..I hope next show will be OK again...I can´t promise since the usual website I get it from is down since Friday...urgh..!!
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-19T13:10Z,Forget what I just wrote... I think I´m able to fix it...! I´m working on it!! 
,papsinc,2012-08-20T10:52Z,"Hi MsFenmore,

just wondering, what is the usual site you get it from. Can u P.S me please."
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-20T12:54Z,The usual site I get it from is the OTR ( Onlinetvrecorder)..everyone can get it there!! 
,papsinc,2012-08-21T07:38Z,thanks for that.
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-21T09:02Z,"Not everyone. I tried but it didn't work.
Am I doing something wrong?"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-08-21T10:35Z,Hmm..not sure...I thought everyone can register there...I pay some money every now and then to get the downloads...
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-21T15:06Z,"I got registered, the episodes ARE there, but when I tried to watch one it banned me, perhaps because I do not live in Germany. So I am still searching for a place. So far thanks to MsFenmore, this experience is available and a bliss.
THANK YOU very much MsFenmore!!!"
,Pegasus03,2012-08-21T19:39Z,Ones nationality has nothing to do with OTR. Just be patient and learn how the recorder works. :) Perhaps you need to be a premium member to download B&B. 
,injiktoplqkto,2012-08-21T21:59Z,"Well, is there any other possible way?
And for free?"
