Description:
Well, what is the Need For Speed ΓÇïΓÇï(namely, what it was and what it was) no need to explain to anyone - yet the most famous racing series in the world. And the quality of each of the particles of the classics can be argued for a long time to discuss, but do not agree with the wildly popular series as a whole - no way. And we can say that with each successive race EA trying to present us something new and unusual (in Underground 2, this was the whole open city, but we remember the first Driver and Midtown Madness 1 and 2, and Most Wanted - an unusual mix of several previous NFS s) and do work on the bugs, that turns out not too good. In this regard, Carbon also continues the tradition of the previous parts, that is, fix bugs and improve on the little things.
The very first thing that catches your eye - again at night. Although while we did not find any neon (see Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift effect), the decision is fundamentally correct, for constantly chases street racers in the afternoon - is absurd. Next - we still leave the police, but while it will no longer play a leading role in Most Wanted, which is what we expected. Leave and the ability to slow down time, and, judging by the video, nothing much has changed - the same impaired control, but to better enter into the turn. About completion of tuning I'll break a little later - EA would introduce enough interesting concept. Given that someone obveska auto races themselves sometimes more important, too, more than the right decision, of course, if the new system will properly implemented (and it seems to get it - it looks very impressive.) But the most important thing, of course - cars.
