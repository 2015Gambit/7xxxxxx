Torrent's not even moving."
,ClubQBall,2012-08-19T16:08Z,"(COUGH)  Do the math, people.  We have FIVE seeders.  We have TWENTY leechers.  Do you REALLY think it's going to move???  

Why don't all of you leechers just seed 25% of the total?  

GIVE BACK INSTEAD OF JUST FUCKING TAKING."
,Rizzo220,2012-08-19T20:55Z,Fk it! I'll say it... Cheers mate for the torrent!

@ClubQBall

Fuck off, douchebag.

It takes some nerve for you to bitch, seeing as you have NEVER POSTED A FUCKING TORRENT.

,exodusdan,2012-08-20T00:18Z,will seed to at least 2:2
,ClubQBall,2012-08-20T02:14Z,"@ Arsventure - LMGDFAO.  You must be one of the fucking assholes that leeches off of everyone.  You're right, I've never uploaded anything on here.

However ... I seed every single motherfucking thing I download for a good solid week, shit-for-brains.  True, I may download ... BUT ... I GIVE BACK.

What do YOU do, Arsventure? You upload ridiculous fucking audio books authored by Donald Trump and New Gingrich.  Yeah, YOU'RE a fucking winner.

Fuck you, dickless.  Go fuck your fat, camel-lookin' Momma's greasy thigh some more."
,ClubQBall,2012-08-20T02:17Z,"Hey, everyone ... this is Arsventure's uploads:

http://thepiratebay.se/user/Arsventure/0/7

Typical fucking idiot conservative who takes from the fucking rest of us ... but never fucking gives back.

Dude, fuck you and that sway-backed nag you rode in.  Go hump your fist some more while you fantasize about Sarah Palin shovin' her strap-on up your ass.  

Idiot.  LMGDFAO.  Ooooh, I'm fucking scared of you."
,mw2merc,2012-08-21T08:33Z,"@torrentx - THX!

@Arsventure - Indeed. Thanks for contributing something someone is gonna make use of.

@ClubQBall - You're making yourself out to be quite the idiot. It's because people who post things that they are available, not cause you seed it.

TONS of us seed what we download. Just cause you don't like what someone else posted & shared doesn't make you the better person cause you seed something else. Go back to your p0rn leeching & have a big cup of StFU!!!

Say what you want, it'll just dig your hole even bigger."
,ClubQBall,2012-08-21T13:32Z,"@ mw2merc - Apparently you must must be another idiot.  Do you NOT know how to read, genius???

""Appreciate the torrent ... but, um, how 'bout seeding it so others can download it and increase the availability???""

This was posted roughly an HOUR after the uploader posted this link ... and yes, shit-for-brains, it DOES fucking matter how many seeders there are.

So, fuck you and that goddamned sway-backed you rode in on.  Mind your own fucking business, asshole.  I wasn't talking to you."
,ClubQBall,2012-08-21T14:29Z,"Oh ... and by the way, folks?  You see all of those +'s up there?  All seven of 'em?  I've been giving those TO torrentxyz every time I come back to this page because I DO appreciate his torrent.  I don't see either one of you fucktards showing appreciation to him in that fashion.  Which one of you two dickless motherfuckers gave him the negative score???

Fuck both of y'all ... Arsventure AND mw2merc.  Fucking idiot teenagers.
