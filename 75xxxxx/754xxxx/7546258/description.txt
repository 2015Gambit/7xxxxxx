Dario Argento wanted to do something different after completing the Animal trilogy. He wanted to do a film that got away from the confines of the giallo and was for the Italian viewer only. Dario decided for this kind of film to be a period piece called Le Cinque Giornate/Five Days in Milan(1973). Dario's work on the excellent Once Upon a Time in the West(1969) played a big part in the making of the movie.

Five Days in Milan(1973) shares many traits with a Sergio Leone film known as A Fistful of Dynamite(1972). The story takes place during the Italian Revolution of 1848. It tried to copy the style of The Wild Bunch(1969) without the same results of success. The story by Dario Argento is not as good as some of the stories for his best Giallos.

The acting is average and the acting of the lead actor is not very good. The director did this film because of a feeling that the Giallo had run its course and was done. Argento tried to do a remake of Frankenstein before embarking to do another Giallo that would be better then the three previous ones of Bird With The Crystal Plumage(1969), Cat O'Nine Tails(1970), and 4 Flies on Grey Velvet(1972). Five Days of Milan(1973) is an unique film by Dario Argento that is for Dario Argento fans only.
