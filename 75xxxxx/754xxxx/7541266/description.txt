Alrighty here we have Godspeed You! Black Emperors total discography, including their actual first debut "All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling". As opposed to the other torrent that claims to be that album, this torrent contains the actual album. Its probably one of the rarest albums that you can hunt for considering only 33 copies were made, all of them on cassette. You can find .rar and .zip archives all over the net that claim to be ALFotHAP but most of them are fakes, filled with Godspeed tracks but NOT ALFotHAP. Rest assured this isnt one of those bullshit archives. 
 
All tracks are properly labeled/tagged and in MP3 format. Artwork for all albums 
included as well.
