[T],junoon,2012-08-20T11:57Z,did u have a dc++ hub?
,ironman1383,2012-08-20T15:46Z,mp4 format dont waste our time with mp 4 you cannnot stream mp 4  who would upload a wrestling torrent in mp 4 format only a loser that watches media on his computer would give a flying fuck about mp4 great job uploading mp 4 killing yet again another wrestling torrent
,SCSA420,2012-08-20T17:29Z,"If you don't like mp4 then convert it to MKV with the instructions I included in the .nfo file but guess what I don't seem to have a problem here playing it on VLC or media player classic , windows media player, PS3, Xbox360 or my 2 BluRay players or my Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. I tested the file before I uploaded it for compatiblity with the above devices. 

The only thing is that you may need to split the mp4 file into 2 parts since it is over 4 GB. You can use a program called Yamb to split the mp4 file into 2 equal parts in the editing part of the Yamb program. Do a search for Yamb on Google and download and install it.

After you install it open the Yamb program click on editing then click to split mp4 at the top then select the Summerslam mp4 video file on input then choose split by duration and enter this time here  01:25:11.000 then click next and it will split the file when it is done you will have 2 video files ready to be played. I shouldn't have to explain all this after the fact of paying $54.99 for the PPV show then capturing it and being nice enough to upload it here for people to get for free but I will this one time for the benefit of people who want to split the mp4 video file into 2 equal parts."
,GanjaGuy420,2012-08-20T17:39Z,This is the slowest torrent ever. Been downloading for 10 hours and I just hit 50 percent.
,pink1905,2012-08-20T19:51Z,"Gonna drop this one, too damn slow."
,.Leto.,2012-08-20T23:00Z,"I stopped downloading this too, way too slow.

,iamsith,2012-08-21T00:53Z,"ya man, sorry.. i just checked on this... i been dling for 16hrs 45min at this point and i am only at 71.9%."
,abrahamdavid25,2012-08-21T03:24Z,HAI FRIEND (LETO). CAN YU TELL ME THE SITE FROM WHICH YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED SUMMERSLAM
,SCSA420,2012-08-21T04:23Z,I apologize for the upload being slower the normal but one of my 2 internet connections is down right now so I only have 1 broadband connection to seed with right now but I have been seeding since I uploaded this show. The problem is an ISP problem in my area that I have NO control over here. Oh and I'm capturing WWE Monday Night Raw Supershow right now live on the USA HD channel in the USA.
,.Leto.,2012-08-21T04:28Z,"@ abrahamdavid25: sure but it's a russian site so I don't know if you're going to like it
