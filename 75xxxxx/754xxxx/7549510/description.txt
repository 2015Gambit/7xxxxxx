Match of the Day Two 19.08.2012

Duration: 1 Hour

Colin Murray is joined by guests including Mark Lawrenson for highlights of the day's Premier League fixtures between Wigan and Chelsea and Manchester City and Southampton - as well as a round-up of Saturday's seven matches.

Hopes are high for Roberto di Matteo's buoyant Chelsea, who launched a new league title bid off the back of a season of relative domestic transition - despite sensationally winning the European Champions League. They are keen to improve on their 1-1 draw at the DW Stadium in Lancashire last season.

Roberto Mancini's Manchester City, inspired by David Silva, host newly-promoted Southampton in confident mood ahead of a campaign in which they are determined to build upon, winning a first league championship since 1968.
