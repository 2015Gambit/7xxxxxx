Christafari is a Christian reggae band formed in 1990. It is centered around the personality of ordained religious minister Mark "Tansoback" Mohr, an American born-again Christian. Until the age of 17, Mohr was a Rastafarian. The essential goal of Christafari is to promote Christianity to Rastafarians.
