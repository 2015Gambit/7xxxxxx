btw it corrupts old saves, so enjoy"

The following issues have been fixed

- Update to the Readme file"

Game saves work fine and do not corrupt.

If you're afraid, I still suggest you go to your Documents folder > My Games > Make a copy of the ""DarksidersII"" folder.

This patch also makes the Steam overlay work if you add it to your Steam games list.

Thanks for upload!"
