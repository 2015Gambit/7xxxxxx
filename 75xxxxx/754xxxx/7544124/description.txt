Tim Hart - Milling The Wind

Released: 17 Aug 2012
ItΓÇÖs a well-worn truth: wearing your heart on your sleeve can be dangerous. But for Tim Hart, itΓÇÖs the only way to sing. Redemptive and rollicking, Milling The Wind is the debut album from this talented Sydney singer/songwriter: 12 tracks of folk-inspired finery, from gentle, finger picked odes (ΓÇ£ArchitectsΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£The Old GateΓÇ¥) to jaunty, banjo offerings (ΓÇ£Cover Of Your CodeΓÇ¥) and dark, under bellied ballads (ΓÇ£Borrowed & VacantΓÇ¥). Steeped in tradition but looking firmly to the future, itΓÇÖs an album that sits close to the bone for its young creator.
