RegexMagic v1.2.1 ~HuNtEr~

Description: First, you provide RegexMagic with some samples of the text you want your regular expression to match. RegexMagic can automatically detect what sort of pattern your text looks like. Numbers, dates, and email addresses are just a few examples of the wide range of patterns that RegexMagic supports. By marking different parts of your samples, you can create regular expressions that combine multiple patterns to match exactly what you want. RegexMagicΓÇÖs patterns provide many options, so you can make your regular expression as loose or as strict as you want.
