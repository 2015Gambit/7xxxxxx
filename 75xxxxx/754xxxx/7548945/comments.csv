The cuts at commercial breaks aren't great, but they may be the best that was possible (some shows are just bad that way)

The naming convention on your files could be improved. ""Sinbad S01E07 Xvid-AJAXEN.avi"" would be closer to the standard. And it would allow better searching by people looking for a particular episode. If I were looking for season 1 episode 1, an obvious way would be to search for ""Sinbad S01E01"". But your stuff wouldn't get displayed that way. Of course, it is your choice.

Seeded to 49x so far, will continue."
