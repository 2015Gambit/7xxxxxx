Screen-shots by doing ""view JPG""

If you have not these abbilities, get good, new torrent-cliennt.

But, I know how you haven't asked that and you are probably too stupid to realize it.

Namely, supplied .nfo and .jpg any normal downloader who is new or have doubts, can download before actual download and both files have information one need. If you are simply blind - watching a movie is something you don't need and then simply stay away. Rest assured, nobody need you or your download.

I know, again, how is this you don't need to hear.

https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=15051

Video Details - Here it gets a little technical, but please bear with me, we're almost finished. You can download a program like gSpot or MediaInfo and export the relevant information for your post. Include things like the Video Codec, Resolution, Framerate, Avg. Video Bitrate, Bits/Pixel, Aspect Ratio, Audio Codec, Audio Bitrate and the number of Audio Channels.

[V],twentyforty,2012-08-18T15:45Z,NFO is right there. Funny how you can read own writing only.
[V],twentyforty,2012-08-18T16:03Z,"Look Zit_Bug aliases: You can bitch and mourn and go crazy - whenever you like.  It can't fly.

Posting link to your own misery is too obvious.

Go there, be there, stay there. Here, nobody needs, myself even less to hear ""What my ass  can and yours not"".

Count your words then count mine:
