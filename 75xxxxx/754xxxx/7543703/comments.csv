one

and the oil rig.. i think they didnt get anything
on experiment as the stakes where lit up that day

but for the creature.. nah.. he didnt show them photos of it alive.. hairless and the weird eyes
however it could of been some alien
experiment with the monkey that escaped :)

[V],psspss,2012-08-18T13:09Z,stacks I mean
,bubbanuggzz,2012-08-19T14:14Z,"I buy the balloons but not all of the oil rig.those stacks dont stop running until the oil stops flowing.they're about the same temp all the time.most of what they saw where stacks,its the 3 caught on Radar that make me think.as far as the show it self I'd kinda like to see it get picked up for another season but at the same time I wouldn't realy miss it if it didn't.the cast is all wrong.a guy that will always believe its ET no matter what,a guy that will never believe its ET no matter what & a chick trying to play both sides.it sounds crazy but I think Ryder is the only one that should stay on.they should find two other ""experts"" that are more open minded to the others cause & not so flatly against each other"
[V],psspss,2012-08-19T17:51Z,"you can see when they zoom the stacks werent lit though

and with the satelite line up kinda makes it very debunkable

the mufon guy/skeptic is good I think..

ryder is too excitable and spooked
but then they crazy to be out there without
some guns most of the time
so is DT team

does bear spray work on cougars too ?

and the big chin and nose guy.. name slips 
but hes a total believer and a bit too easy
to believe stuff


according to the interview on openminds
ryder is one of the producers.. so does that mean shes got shares or cash in it to get a slice
of the profits.. and less likely to be sacked

sounds like a S02 may happen.. despite the poor ratings"
,SerSpec-V,2012-08-23T03:02Z,I hope Ryders gravy train comes to an end.
