Thanks KrazyKrvs. My regards to SUJAIDR. He/she/it? has given many hours of entertainment to many people out there. It's nice to see someone else inspired to do the same. By the way is SUJAIDR a real person or an organization? I don't know what pronoun to use when referring him/her/it. (I have the same problem with YIFY, sCorp, Anoxmous, and a few others out there that seem too prolific to be a single human being)

PS - Yes, subtitles!"
,KrazyKrvs,2012-08-19T19:14Z,"@B.KITZ : Wen it comes to Indian movies size has to be big buddy.... bcz our movies are very bright,, very colorful & lengthy too... So for good quality Indian movies size has to be big.... You can check the other small uploads... yu'll find the difference..."
,KrazyKrvs,2012-08-19T19:16Z,"@fakeidmuhammad : He's a real person...:) and its HE...:) And its not an organization... He used to upload individually... But we used to be on the same Release Group i.e., TMRG...:)

Thanku"
,B.KITZ,2012-08-19T21:10Z,Yeah okay ... BTW what happened to @sujaidr ... How come he stopped uploading ??? ...
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-08-20T07:20Z,"@ KrazyKrvs,
Thanks for the info.

It's good to know there are actually ""real"" people still left on the internet. 

I'm guessing that if sujaidr encoded 500 odd movies on TPB alone, then encoding and compressing to 1/10 the size doesn't take a lot of computing power or time. It may be something I could do on my machine if I had the know-how. Can you recommend any good instructional websites, or gurus? (beginner's level please).

I've never downloaded anything from AMEET6233, but since you cite him/her/it as an influence, I will. I'll start with ""A Trip to the Moon"" (1902) 720p only 114.93 MiB. Nice small file to replace my 2.11 GiB file! (What is that: 1/18th the size? Damn!!)

PS - What pronoun should I use for AMEET6233 - he, she, or it?"
,KrazyKrvs,2012-08-20T13:47Z,"@KITZ.. Well this is not the place to discuss abt sujaidr.... So can't ell you much...

@fakeidmuhammad : Bhai it looks easy but to compress the movie to the ratio's u said,, it'll take hours of work.. At the least to make a proper encode it takes 4-6 hours.... And coming to sujai's 500 torrents,, not all of them are his own encodes.. He uploaded many scOrp rips & also others which i can't tell yu...

And most of the uploaders are HE... And same goes with me & Ameet too..... 
Thanku..."
