[V],80zforever,2012-08-20T00:04Z,"Welcome guys and thanks for commenting. dragonbandit314, this was supposed to be one vol. but I came across a few cool records in a Seattle vinyl store this past week and used couple of songs to make this two vols. "
,Ultragod,2012-08-20T05:46Z,"HEY!  =)  Some1 please seed # 44, 46, 47, 48, & 49!  =D  It would also B handy if some1 seeded the 'rare hits' stuff also, but in larger compilations so don't need as many separate torrents 2 DL.  Having hundreds of torrents going tends 2 make the program less stable  =(  Once I have them all I may combine them & seed that way 4 extra convenience 4 every1  =8^D"
,Giallokiller,2012-08-21T12:35Z,"Thank you very much for your 80's collections! Once again I found some unknown gems I would have never heard about! E.g. Graphic's Transition is a really good one but I can't find any information about them! I'd love to hear more from them!
Anybody have their LP?

Thx"
,r.trifun,2012-08-21T16:41Z,"What a collection of completely overlooked rarities. So many new (unleast for me) beautiful gems to enjoy.
It's not just that you've made my day, but rather the whole week.
Cheers."
,alejandro70pb,2012-08-22T01:36Z,GRACIAS and welcome 80zForever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Trickster58,2012-08-23T04:43Z,"Many thanks for the rare tracks and albums you have uploaded over the years!  Can't seem to find Mondo Vita's 1983 release ""Fins de Paris"" anywhere online.  Any chance you have a copy since you frequent the Seattle music scene stores I did back in the 80's?"
[V],80zforever,2012-08-23T22:11Z,"Thanks for the comments people. I am glad some folks still follow my posts.

Giallokiller, Graphic's song ""Transition"" is off their lone record ""The Baysongs"". It's a private pressing and ultra rare. I have seen a copy on ebay recently selling for around $30.00. I'd hopefully post it in a next little while.

Trickster58, I have a copy of it that I had bought many years ago, but never got to have it digitalized. I will post it once I clean it up and convert to mp3

Thanks again guys."
,dragonbandit314,2012-08-24T08:39Z,"Well 80z, looks like I was right.
You ain't gonna retire any time soon.
Just when you think you're done ... another request.
Hell, it's good to be wanted.
(Well, for the right reasons anyway.)
Be well. T."

Thank you man! :)
By the way, I found a 7'' of Frame by Frame's Lies. Do you happen to have the 12"" single? It's got 5 tracks instead of 2 and the Lies track is 7:30 min.

Thx"
[V],80zforever,2012-08-25T10:21Z,"Giallokiller, no I have the 7'' single but I have seen the EP on a blog if I am not wrong. cheers"

Thanks!  Glad you have the Mondo Vita LP I'm looking for.  Appreciate the response and look forward to the upload.  Cheers!"

,digitalpress,2012-09-02T15:50Z,"It is SO great to see you back! I'd almost given up (but am still seeding all of these and your ""rare albums"" series). Hope all is well and thanks for the music!"
