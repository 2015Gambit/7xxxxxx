BTW, in your archives do you happen to have a decent copy of ' Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials ' by Kalpakjian that you might be willing to upload. Looks like a useful reference text. "

Great job you're doing over there sharing invaluable knowledge. We really appreciate it.

I don't know the right place to make a request, excuse me if this is not it, but I really want this book- ""Textbook of Medical Physiology"" by Boron and Boulpaep.

It'll be really appreciated if you upload this one, it is really wanted by many med students :)"
