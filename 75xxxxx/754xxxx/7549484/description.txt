'They Slipped briskly into an Intimacy from Which They Never Recovered. '

~ F. Scott Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 ~ December 21, 1940) This Side of Paradise (1920)

and Ivy Pablo Meet again, this time in Paradise.

Watch Them make Passionate Love and Their Experience Ecstasy as He Takes her Completely.

PS (F. Scott - I'm not) but we all aspire to be something more than we are, so please humor me with the quotes! XOXO Love ~ Colette

P.PS You'll Notice That this video is in a Different Location than the photos. We lost the light while taking the photos, so we had to move for the video. I think you will LOVE it regardless
