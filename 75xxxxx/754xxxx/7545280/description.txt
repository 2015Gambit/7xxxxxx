Notes: Ok we were given some nice files of this new source a while back but been
working on several things at one time so took longer too get out Anyway new
source is better but still has issues ...issues being cropped on the left side,
however much better cropping at the bottom ...also like the other SainT cams,
there is a slight pulse in some parts of the video Video was missing a little bit
of the intro and at 11mins roughly the screen went blank ,these places have been
replaced with the source 26k released Video also had whacked AR and really bad
angle so had too fix all that up aswell as changing the contrast,colours,remove
some noise etc Audio was new and unsured i think so far ....most used the tooth
fairy audio before.Well this audio IMHO is better ...got alot more live too it
and sounds clearer Like always audio had to be syncd too the video and we also
cleaned it as it was too powerful the way it was

So folks,enjoy this FULL video and not the claimed too be full from the noobies
