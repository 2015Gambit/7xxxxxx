Thank you!"
,ziggyff,2012-08-18T06:16Z,thanks but is there a reason this has to be a zipped/rar file..multiple reasons on why it's not a preferred setup...

,cheapyellowmustard,2012-08-18T07:03Z,"ummm...why is this a RAR?  
Fuck sceneline and scenebalance trying to shove RAR down everyone's throats!
i WANT my EZTV!"
,tarball8,2012-08-18T07:29Z,1.3 Gigs?  If a frigging talk show.   I don't need to see every blemish on their faces.
,spacemancalvin,2012-08-18T07:36Z,"No one is forcing RAR down anyones throat... If you don't want this.. guess what? You don't have to torrent this. Obviously tvteam is better but this is the only torrent as of right now so its better than nothing, therefore thanks nevertheless..."
,xia_nt,2012-08-18T07:38Z,"Not worth the download. too much is sketchy about it. wait a few hours for a better more reliable source, eztv for example "

,xenoFLASH,2012-08-18T07:50Z,thank you for putting this out so quick.
,lovelylogic,2012-08-18T08:13Z,has anyone actually gotten the torrent yet? 
,solidsam22,2012-08-18T13:11Z,This is shit - stay away from Scene* torrents
,tanifa,2012-08-18T13:22Z,Agree with tarball8.  If you can't get it under 400mb then don't even put it up here... 
[V],spastik64,2012-08-18T14:30Z,"All haters must say THANKS to scene to release it.... wait 2 or 3 weeks for a p2p bad release.

About rar's..... learn about scene or do not download."
,timothx,2012-08-18T15:35Z,Thank you.
,kitrana,2012-08-18T17:40Z,funny 7zip says the files broken and can complete the extraction
,puunjab,2012-08-18T17:50Z,"Learn About Rar's yourself dipshit.

HD Video is already as compressed as it can get so RAR'ing saves no bandwidth. All it does is unnecessarily add the video to a file container format that is not universal and causes people headaches. I have a RAR client and have no problem decompressing RAR files, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT MAKES ANY SENSE OR ADDS ANY VALUE.

RAR makes sense for torrents that have files that CAN be compressed. But, anyone who thinks RAR'ing heavily compressed video makes sense, has opened their mouth and proved they are a fool.

You literally can't fix stupid."
,dougq,2012-08-18T18:18Z,"Thanks for the upload.
It played fine.
I don't understand people throwing mud at the uploader. He or she may not be aware that bittorrent technology does not require segmenting."
,jrdenn1981,2012-08-18T20:09Z,"The scenebalance torrent is fake  w/ possible virus. You can d/l the latest episode of Realtime @ http://eztv.it/ep/37238/real-time-with-bill-maher-2012-08-17-hdtv-x264-sys/ ...........Sucks that people ul shit.  If you don't trust my link, I suggest waiting on TVteam or something more reputable. Now, I'm off to watch Bill!!!!!!!!"
,Lonsman,2012-08-18T22:09Z,"Thanks very much for this. I don't mind RARs at all; anybody can use any number of simple programs to assemble the files in seconds. Apparently, some of the eegits here know SFA about their computers...so just let them download someone else's fu**ing files!"
,Lonsman,2012-08-18T22:22Z,"P.S. I am always extremely GRATEFUL for your files!
Thanks again!!"
,MrGeneric,2012-08-18T23:10Z,"Oh great a bunch of .RARs. More annoying ""scene"" bullshit""."
,lattari,2012-08-20T18:47Z,"For the love of God, if you don't like it don't download it. Comments, that are as hateful and ignorant as some of the above, embarass all of us.

This rip, like all rips that are labeled in the same manner ending with -release gruop, come from what is called the scene. Google it, if you want to learn more. One of their rule is, that video files are to be compressesd into RAR files. The uploader (sceneline) got it in that format. Attacking him/her for not extracting them for you is ridicilous. It takes less than a minute to do so it should be the most trivial thing. We are not babies and do not need to be spoon fed.

I happen to prefer small files as RARs, because it indicates that an over eager 'ripper' hasn't re-encoded  the file, so the quality is what its suppodsed to be.

Thank you for uploading this. I hope you have patience with the flamers.

Also. there are no viruses in this release. Please don't try to spread paranoia just because you don't like an upload. "
