Description:
Hello and welcome to our game server Atlanta. Probably each of us, while playing on some server, a desire to create a similar, but much better, with no problems and errors. That is what led us to the idea of ΓÇïΓÇïcreating a place where you, dear players, would be able to enjoy all the pleasures and possibilities of the beloved game Perfect World.

Were also created exclusive locations such as Atlanta, City of the Renaissance and the City Tsunami. In them we have invested everything that always wanted and dreamed of seeing other serverah.Opisaniya these cities will help evaluate their beauty and uniqueness of the true value
