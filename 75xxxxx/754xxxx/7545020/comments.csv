,insigniaplasma,2012-08-19T17:07Z,the text isn't showing up in pop up bubbles but the game works. hard to play without knowing what's said
,thriftstoretalent,2012-08-19T19:25Z,"what OS are you running? i'm on Windows 7 and not having that problem. if you're running Vista, try right-clicking the game's launch icon, click ""properties"" at the bottom, click ""compatibility"" tab, select ""run as administrator"" and ""run in compatibility mode"" for ""Windows XP SP3"". you could also try updating your graphics card from the device manager. let us know if either of these things works for you."
,thriftstoretalent,2012-08-19T19:27Z,"i tried searching the forums for anything related to this problem as well, and i haven't been able to find anything so far. if anyone else knows how to fix this please post your solution for insigniaplasma."
