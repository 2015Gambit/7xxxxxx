I have listened to many Robert Plant concerts over the years
and this one ranks up in the top for sound quality. One of the
Best!  Track 4 is simply great.
Robert is very loose and seems to be having a great time.
He nails Babe I'm Gonna Leave You.
Cool

I know some of you may already have this but I wanted to share
with those who do not have this yet.
Play It Loud!!
