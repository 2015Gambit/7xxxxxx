Folder Lock 7.0.5 - {EC}


Encrypt your personal files using 256-bit on-the-fly military grade encryption 

technology. You create Encrypted storages to keep your important files encrypted. 

These storage 'Lockers' are dynamic, smaller in size when created and grow as your 

need increases. All the data remains encrypted even when you are accessing your 

files. Decryption process takes place in memory leaving no traces or recoverability 

of the file on your system. 


You can convert your encrypted storage 'Lockers' into encrypted executable files. 

Since these files contain your encrypted data and do not require you to install 

Folder Lock on the other computer, you can access your files with a correct 

password on any computer whether its a non-admin or admin Windows machine. You can 

protect your USB drives, external drives, CDs, DVDs and even Email Attachments.



Protect your data from unwanted access and visibility by blocking access to the 

files, folders, drives, and programs you choose. You can also choose between 

whether you want to lock or hide your files or lock and hide them both. The Windows 

kernel level locking and filter driver makes it possible even to lock these items 

in Windows Safe Mode. Its friendly user-interface does as well allow single-click 

data protection straight from the Context Menu.
