,micron66,2012-08-18T04:19Z,"also,looking at the screens there seems to be quite a bit of pixelation."
,mt_phile,2012-08-18T05:55Z,"Can anyone RIP just the Korean subs on a transparent background so I can lay it over this and simulate all the shitty RIPs of this movie that have come before?

Thanks BOZX!"

,micron66,2012-08-18T09:06Z,"@kiwij

thanks for confirming that,i thought it was only me who noticed.

anyway,i will wait for the R1 bluray,this seems to be  a R2 bluray (Europe)."

,abdep,2012-08-18T09:56Z,use RLSlog in the future to confirm scene releases
