In Fred 3: Camp Fred, Freds mom (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) enrolls him in the worlds 
worst summer camp - the dilapidated Camp Iwannapeepee. Fred is miserable until he 
meets a motley group of campers who teach him what camp is really about  
making new friends. Together, Fred and his new friends, Magoo (Joey Bragg), 
Dig (Adrian Kali Turner, Bad Teacher, The Walking Dead), Spoon (Leah Lewis), 
and Chatter (Matthew Scott Miller), are determined to muster up the strength and 
confidence to beat their rivals at the nearby posh Camp Superior in the annual 
Summer Camp Games.
