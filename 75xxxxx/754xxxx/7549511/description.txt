Hammond/Guitar/Drums trio


The Hammond does double duty on Bass here with several nods to John Coltrane.

I haven't seen this in FLAC so it's about time for some reasonable sonic fidelity.


Source Provenance:  A full digital recording (DDD) from 1994

Ripped from a CDR I burned in 2003 from a guitarist friend of mine's collection.


Note:  "Long strategy" media ie cyanine(blue)dye seems far superior to "short 

strategy" media for longevity. 


Nice interplay in some of these tracks
