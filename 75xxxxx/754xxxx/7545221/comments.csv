It's probably not noticable, but if you get an issue playing chapter 2 of 1st title, something you don't have to do at all playing the flick - it crashes. To fix it use PGCedit - delete the last chapter of title 1 and save. Or if there is enough nagging, I'll upload the VIDEO_TS .BUP&ISO + VTS_01.0.IFO for fix."
