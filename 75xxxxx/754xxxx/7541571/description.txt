
Fela Kuti - Music is the weapon - Music Documentary


This is a great documentary that serves as a brilliant introduction not only to the amazingly funky rhythms of Felas contribution to music i.e. Afro-Beat, but also to the ragged state of African Politics.

Fela was a brilliant musician but in addition to this he offered a vision of a new Nigeria that was free of totalitarian control and promoted an African identity free from western influence.

The doc. itself is well put together and features some exciting performances live from Felas club which is worth the download alone.
