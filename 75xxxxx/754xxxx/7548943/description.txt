Does Modern Israel Have a Role in the End Times?

Did God fulfill the Old Testament prophecies of the restoration of Israel with Ezra, Nehemiah, and the early church, or have we seen them come to pass in recent decades?

Many Christians believe that the creation of the modern state of Israel in 1948 fulfilled Old Testament prophecy and heralded the imminent return of Christ.

But what does the Bible mean when it talks about the restoration of Israel?

And what happens to the identity of God's people and the entire fabric of Bible prophecy when modern Israel becomes the subject of the Old Testament prophets?

Gary Demar And Jim Fletcher


Jim Fletcher: Arguing in the Affirmative
Author of It's the End of the World As We Know It, speaker Jim Fletcher is the director of Prophecy Matters, Master Books, and the Icon Publishing Group. Drawing heavily from 20th century Israeli history, the Zionist movement, several Old Testament passages, and his own personal experience in Israel, Fletcher argues that God's support of the modern state of Israel as the restored kingdom foretold in the prophets is indisputable. Approximately 30 minutes in length. 

Gary DeMar: Arguing in the Negative
In his opening statement, American Vision President Gary DeMar weaves a cohesive argument from scripture and history, demonstrating the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in times past, the misapplication of New Testament images by premillenial commentators, and the confusion that ensues when the modern Israel package deal is forced on the Scriptures. Approximately 30 minutes in length.
