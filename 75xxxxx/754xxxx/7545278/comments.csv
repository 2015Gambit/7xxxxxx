,mick58,2012-08-23T12:09Z,"Agree with A V level, Damn good for a Rip"
,pink50,2012-08-24T08:48Z,"oh my..total recall without arnold?? i miss those great abs and totally recalling his lovely biceps,teehee..Colin Farrell is cute"
,zezant,2012-08-24T11:54Z,"TerryT713 
I'm interested.
How much is your pay at Universal or whatever?
Do you get paid by the word or?
To spread disinformation?
Your methods have evolved over the last 2 years.
I will give you that.

Movie is perfectly OK.
The plot is there."
,wendelj,2012-08-25T15:18Z,To whoever did this rip. Way to go. Finally somebody knows how to use a camera. It's not that hard folks. This is how it's done. 
,clintscrazylife,2012-08-25T20:44Z,"What the hell? Sony edited out the boobs of the three breasted hooker. I saw this in theatre and it showed her full breasts, nipples and all. But this download has her wearing a top so you cant see anything. I bet the MPAA came down on them for being a PG-13 movie with nudity. You'll probably only get to see them now in the ""Unrated"" version of the DVD. Lame."
,bayharborbutcher,2012-08-26T00:37Z,Anyone able to tell me what happens during the part missing from this rip?  I just want to know so I can watch it and still get the story since some people are saying it's important.
,Es2Kay,2012-08-26T13:05Z,"Good copy, totally watchable. Don't listen to 'nairobi19' audio is okay,  no problem understanding what's being said. Thanks for upload!"
,klip1,2012-08-27T14:09Z,"Just wanted to stop by and show my thnx to scene4all for the up.

Release is completely watchable on a widescreen laptop.  Never tried on a big TV.

Roomie and I loved the movie, was full of action!

They kinda stole the inception theme if you ask me, but all in all awesome movie!

A/V = 7 (Solid CAM)
M = 8 (On HD or in 3D this would be a 9 or ten in my book though.)"
,triniguy38,2012-08-28T18:39Z,sample looks gr8. will comment after watching movie
,spiderr,2012-08-29T06:28Z,Just because you put a glowy thing on a Mateba doesn't mean it's got infinite ammo. Male lead is a chump and the chick he 'defects' for is almost as bad.
,Future_TV,2012-08-31T23:27Z,Will will Hollywood learn their lesson about Colin Ferrel? He's a goober.
,AshtonK,2012-09-01T03:39Z,whats anon download?
,steven4,2012-09-01T09:48Z,thanx..rishman
,graywoulf,2012-09-04T22:18Z,How the heck did Cinavia get into this?
,graywoulf,2012-09-04T22:20Z,Thanks for the upload but how the heck did Cinavia get into this?
,Reyz0R,2012-09-06T03:17Z,BEST CAM so far....definetly recommend it! Audio-8 Video-8 Film-7.8
,joaf01,2012-09-06T12:00Z,Can anyone confirm that there are missing scenes before i download this version ?
,piranical,2012-09-08T18:36Z,very nice. definitely best cam yet v8.5a7 (based on cam)
,Dramat,2012-09-08T19:50Z,"This is BEST cam I've ever seen (!)
Rating (cam rating):
A: 10/10 
In most cams music is a noise - especially in action scenes - but here you can hear everything just fine and enjoy (!) music as well. This is VERY rare in cam-rip case. 
A: 10/10
Very nice work - even those two moments when uploader borrow parts from other cams - still looking very, very good - and those ""borrowed scenes"" are really short. Depth of the scenes is well visible, you can easly see many levels (for ex. lower and upper platforms, etc.) of the shown sets - including many details. Very nice video quality.
M: 8/10
I LOVE Total Recall with Arnie, and I was very sceptic about it. But this is really FINE movie. I surely buy a DVD of this one.
About movie length - total time of this file is 01:49:30 (109 minutes and 30 seconds). According to IMDB movie length is 118 minutes - but WITH ending credits. For example ending credits of The Avengers took 10 minutes. I didn't saw any cuts or action missing. IMO this is FULL movie with BEST quality out there.

All those pricks writing about cutted scenes or ""cinema protected"" shit are just fucking money-whores payed by corporation which don't give a fuck about you or anyone else - money is their God. If those dumb corporate bitches would make this movie available to watch via internet - I would pay for it. I guess they're too stupid to understand that, and they themself are forcing ""piracy"" by their own stupidity. Not to mention lost potential income (there's may like me, who would pay just to see movies in their homes on premiere date)
So keep in mind - if you see many comments like that under pre-DVD/BR rip torrents - it may be a sign its really good copy. 
This one definitely IS !!"
,Dramat,2012-09-08T19:51Z,"By mistake I used second time letter ""A"" to describe video (""V"") quality. Sorry."
,senssuiy,2012-09-11T08:17Z,great man thanks...
,shahinjsr,2012-09-11T13:29Z,"There were plenty of action sequences, and most of the time the film gave us eye candy that we haven't seen before. It seemed as though a general theme in the film (besides ""questioning what's real"") was constant play with gravity. This may have been influenced by inception, but the world turns upside down a few times, and it's visually interesting. I saw it on freefree.noahw.org they have great quality. I recommend the movie, a great one!"
,BMeyerGator,2012-09-11T23:59Z,"I have no ideo how some ppl are giving this a 10 and saying ""best cam"" and so on. Not worth watching in my opinion. Can't enjoy bc the audio is lame and the video is dark. If you really want to enjoy this movie, just wait a few weeks longer until the real movie comes out.

A:3
V:3
M:?"
,wymm666,2012-09-13T01:01Z,"Ok for a cam I guess, But I couldn't get through the first 2 min of watching this.

V: 3. The recording is terrible, really, I could get seizure for watching this any longer. There's constant flashing

A: 7, actually well above average, except I should be watching this ... with my eyes.

M: not worth commenting, seeing how I couldn't finish the first 2 minutes even, and really shouldn't, because ppl should comment on the quality of the digital file itself, not its artistic values."
,InsainMem,2012-09-13T03:43Z,"This NOT a CAM, it is a TELESYNC (TS)!
(main difference is that TS's are professionally done in the actual proj. booth and they directly record the audio from its/a source)

Technically, a Telesync is a type of cam, but that's just the lay definition of a telesync.  When used as jargon for torrent sites, a Cam and a Telesync are two completely different things.  This is important because the expectations for a TS are much higher than those for a Cam.
For all intents and purposes, a Telesync is the best possible cam (usually).

For all those who are saying this is the best cam ever, you are wrong, but also a little right. 
You would be as right as saying that a DVD rip is the best Screener they have ever seen.
(In the real world, a Screener is a DVD, but they are also two completely different things in the world of torrents)"
,kennykillerkoala,2012-09-13T09:00Z,"This movie ranked as total shit  but they didn't want a pun involved so they re-ranked it as complete utter fucking crap.
http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/triplej/film/movies_totalrecall.mp3 listen to the review"
,freeforlife,2012-09-14T21:05Z,"Watched it in theater,what a good movie,liked the original,but this holds up to high expectations.Kate Backinsale and Jessica Biel are fantastic,Collin is good also,but Kate and Jess,awesome.
M:10"
,pp1dg,2012-09-16T09:44Z,"Thanks, Scene4all!
This TS has a great quality!"
,PunkBuzter,2012-09-16T19:08Z,"@BMeyerGator

actually we have to wait a few months. dvd release is estimated in december.
at least that's what imdb is saying."
