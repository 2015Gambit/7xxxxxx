Notes: VIDEO:

So, the main problem was that the vid had frame drops/skips/cuts and missing
footage The vid is missing 4 mins and few secs which has been used from 720p
ARiSE release but since the res on ARiSE rls was different we opted to go rather
for cropping than bad AR beacuse there is a big jump in res As for that frame
drops/skips/cuts... we couldnt do nothing about it. Its no biggie mainly it
appears from 55th min to 67th min, and a few times after that Playback may come
to you choppy, so thats whyy we mentioned it and nobody can whine about not
mentioning it

AUDIO:

Sync was a biatch to do due to the problems mentioned above. Audio had to be
stretched and restretched many times and also we had to do a lot of cuts. You
wont notice them cuts because we tried to cut only "dead parts" - where there was
no speaking. There was a lot of effort put into our sync and others who tried to
attempt the sync will knowwhat we are talking about 
Once synced, we had to clean audio from all the weird noice, hum, hiss, crackle
etc...If trying to remove all of them comletely, we would ruin the eq band and
make audio sound muffled and "robotic noise" in background. So, decided to go for
softer settings and use more filters to come to an end we "loved" the most
