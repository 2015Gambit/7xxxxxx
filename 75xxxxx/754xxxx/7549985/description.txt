=======================================

Follow Dana on her misadventures in and around the comic convention scene. It's a fast and furious look at the quirky characters of the comic community and their rivalries, where the battles are so bitter because the stakes are so small. Dramatic license has been taken with the con goings-ons, but the content will still have you nodding in ruthless agreement. 

Thanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.
