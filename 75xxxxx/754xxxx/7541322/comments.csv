,teddyox,2012-08-28T18:44Z,Too bad Season 5 is NOT dvdrip. The rest are. other than that great torrent and fantastic size.
,xpmule,2012-08-29T04:43Z,"season 5 is released on dvd..

the.big.bang.theory.s05e01.dvdrip.xvid-demand.avi

most dvd releses are never put on torrents sites so.. better get googling if you want them lol

i dunno why people bend over backwards re posting tv rips over and over when dvd rips are available and sadly since they don't go on p2p the file locker links eventually get reported and the release disappears and thats why i collect them but i don't have the upload speed to add so many dvd rips :("
,.Hermit.,2012-09-02T04:09Z,Thanks man.
,Feenixx,2012-09-08T21:14Z,"Any word on the quality from those that have downloaded this? I'd love to get a DVD copy, if only to replace those I have with the annoying logos in the bottom right corner and stupid adds that pop up at the bottom for Survivor and what not. 

But at 60-70 megabytes per episode, I have a hard time believing the quality is any good. Compressing the video to the point of major quality loss really defeats the purpose of a DVD rip, especially when there's other torrents available of higher quality for the whole series. 

Thanks for the effort, anyway. "

x264 provides high quality in small size."

For me anyway, the video quality is great but the audio sucks. VLC, WMP and PS3 all the same for me"
,clackersx,2012-09-16T11:14Z,"I take back my last comment.
Audio is good.
