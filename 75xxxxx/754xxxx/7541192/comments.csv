Sample quality IMO is following: [CAM SCALE !!!]
V: 8/10
A: 6/10

I'll comment further on movie quality soon."

Decent cam/TS. "
,Dramat,2012-08-18T07:41Z,"I have to add that there are moments when camera was moved (resettled - 2 times till half of the movie) and sometimes people (in cinema) are moving in front of the cam (3 times till half of the movie). 
Sound is quite problematic - because it's muffled, when asction takes place and there's vivid music it's almost like noise. That's my honest opinion.

Final quality note:
V: 7/10
A: 5/10

It's free - take it or leave it.

Thanks to the uploader and person who risks recording it. "
