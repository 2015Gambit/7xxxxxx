Active File Recovery 9.0.4 + Crack - [EC]



Active File Recovery for Windows provides the ability to effectively recover lost 

data caused by accidental deletion, disk formatting, virus and other reasons.


The Enterprise package of Active@ File Recovery also includes a Partition Recovery 

tool used to recover data from deleted or damaged volumes. The Partition Recovery 

tool can be launched from the bootable CD to work with a crashed or failing computer 

system.



Active@ File Recovery Enterprise installation package contains a CD/DVD ISO image 

that you can burn to get a bootable CD or DVD with a lightweight version of Windows 

7Γäó running in RAM (WinPE 3.1). It is the only way to recover your data in case your 

system is not bootable and you cannot attach the damaged Hard Disk Drive to another 

machine.
