We have received some complaints about your url.
your usrename is url
your description is only 3 lines, all url
the torrent title has url
the filename has url

after discussing this issue some supermoderators suggested to ban you fully because of this is as spam as it looks, others suggested namechange. 
Here is what is going to happen:
1. i will soon change your username from GlowGaze.Com to GlowGaze
2. you will have to start toning down with url.
put decent description to torrents instead of just urls. stop spamming it it all over the title, description. unless you understand i will block your site

I hope you understand"

I didn't know that the name isn't allowed & it's good that you changed it.

I'll change the way I post torrents & add more description to it with less URLs.

And I'll try to check the comments more often since it seems that it's how you communicate here ;)"
