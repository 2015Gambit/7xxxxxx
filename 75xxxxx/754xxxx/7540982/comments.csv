,pir8s007,2012-08-17T19:29Z,Pls help me to clean TPB...
,hal4000,2012-08-17T22:13Z,Bit silly to upload this on a torrent site. You can download the whole lot (not only this one) from the FAA website: www.faa.gov

Then just work on becoming a moderator... In the meantime, one should let these arrogant duplicators duplicate themselves and recall torrentiquette in all other cases. The Hygrade Syndrome will take care of the rest in the long run."

Haha, you comment does't make no sense as you are.....

if you really wanna make an effort then upload suck a new things. you upload the same thing what someone upload just a 9 days before you and  'Same size' and 'Same quality' 

What's new in your same upload??? what do you think that, Is it a movie with different quality???"

I concur with you and reporting to superbay for wrong torrents.

@594mgnav
you told me that "" then clean urself first up here..then point out on others""

Excuse me, what you know about me??? Does it make any sense!!!"

""you comment does't make no sense as you are""..well what u know abt me to say this(as u made a comment earlier)...

and i am not duplicating..i had this book with me for 2 weeks..but was unable to upload it as i was held up with my personal works...before that, another user found a source which matched mine and then uploaded it here..thats it..

just look at my torrents and comment...its not easy to post torrents like these..it takes some work...and also time...

so PLZ THINK BEFORE YOU COMMENT.IF U LIKE A RELEASE, DOWNLOAD IT AND THANK IT..IF U DONT, JUST MOVE URSELF AWAY....dont just comment like this....

i am not willing to continue this argument...i have my own duties to perform which us more important that wasting time here( in commenting here)..no offence..."
[T],594mgnav,2012-08-18T17:30Z,"---*-----*------*-------*-------*--------*----*----*

end of the argument...plz dont make this a problem..coz its not a problem..it seems many in tpb are searching for mistakes to find and report rather than giving some credits to the uploader...

From where do you get your books???? Websites or did you purchase most of your?? "

dynstab2 is right at some point. their should't be any duplicating.... "
,powerofthemonk,2012-08-21T06:05Z,"I've gotta be on Nanban's side for this. Besides, who cares if someone else uploaded it. It's not like anyone's getting paid for this. And it's a relatively low file size so the number of people uploading shouldn't matter that much. It seems to me people care way to much about sharing information. I mean, we are attacking fellow pirates here."
