Altar Boys were a Christian punk rock band from California, formed in 1982. The Altar Boys helped pioneer Christian rock music. They were known for their Ramones-style punk music, which was radically different than the Christian music common at the time of their formation. Especially in their early years, they were known for being explicit with their faith in their lyrics. Their sound was heavily influenced by the punk rock scene in Southern California, and they quickly became one of the best known Christian bands on that scene. Their first album sold over 7000 copies without distribution, and their second disc sold 20000 units in its first two months of release.
