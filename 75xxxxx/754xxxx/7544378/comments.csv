,alfienoakes1,2012-08-20T07:03Z,"Many of these tracks cut out before the end, for example, track 53."

,Sleepmore,2012-08-21T01:02Z,"Most tracks ends before they are completed, as mentioned above.

Ty for the effort tho.

Anyone else have a complete copy?"
,Sleepmore,2012-08-21T01:59Z,"I found another copy (2x rar), it has the same problems as this one.
So if you search the net for other copies, it seems likely you won't be better off."
,test_account,2012-08-21T14:51Z,"I think problems with tracks cutting early is from the original source, they recently stopped using talking issues and it's be all downhill since then."
