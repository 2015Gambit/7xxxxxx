This if you need or want the standard MP3 audio in your AVI.

Having a dilemma here - purity vs practicality.
It would seem that while AVI can handle AAC quite well,
it doesn't report it quite correctly. Notably (at least some
versions of) VLC doesn't detect the audio track well at all.
Media Player Classic has no problem whatsoever.
The practical says - convert the audio to MP3, since AVI
doesn't do AAC well. But then I'd have to create a moniker
and take credit for actually doing something here.
But MP3 is somewhat standard for AVI, so why not?
