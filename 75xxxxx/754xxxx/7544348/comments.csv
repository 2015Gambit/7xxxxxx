ia600705.us.archive DOT 
org/zipview.php?zip=/6/items/musopen-lossless-dvd/Musopen-Lossless-DVD.zip

They were 16 bit and your files seem to be 24 bit.

For example:
Goldberg Variations, BWV 988 - Aria

So I'm not too confident about this torrent.."
,trejotrejo,2012-08-31T14:26Z,"Yep, I checked again and bit depth doesn't always match. 
When converting between formats there's no reason to change bit depth.
(Probably you won't hear any difference, but it's still wrong.)

So I can't really recommend this torrent.

Hopefully Musopen will eventually release a FLAC version that's not a mess and that's not packed in a broken zip file... "
