The Legend of Spyro Dawn of the dragon for PS3.

the end of The Legend Of Spyro trilogy with better visuals than its PS2 and WII counterpart.

i traveled the internet seas far and wide in search for this game, due to its lack of popularity it was really complicated to find, you can thank Rusia for that.
Disregard that, i don't want anyone to go through the weeks of searching and downloading incomplete sets of files from direct download servers that i went through, so im contributing my grain of sand by seeding this.

tested and working on 3.55 firmware and Multiman
