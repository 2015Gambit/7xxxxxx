1.5.1
- Fixed the issue where it could not detect what server you picked
- Fixed the issue with the command popups
- Improved background activator
- More bug fixes


What to do if it doesn't work:

- Make sure you ran it as Admin
- The KMS server might be down, more servers will be included in future releases
- Make sure you have the proper KMS key that you need installed, more keys and auto OS detection will be added in future releases
- Getting error saying something about non-core, you're inserting a key not for your version
- Do not use a proxy
- If you have any other issues, post below
