[T],bobiras2009,2012-08-18T22:44Z,"Hey guys you need the correct key and the version of your windows 8 too to activate.Try this it will work 100%:

1. Run cmd as admin. Enter one of they keys in here :
slmgr /ipk PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C
slmgr /ipk BYXV8-9YN72-VTF7H-8G7PT-WW8X2
2. Turn off your internet connection
3. Open activation window and click ""Activate"". It'll show your an error.
4. After that you'll see ""Activate by phone"" button.
5. Call to microsoft and enter code from message, which you will see.
6. If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1

and the proof:

If anyone need help let me know.

And of course if it doesnt work see these for problems:

- Make sure you ran it as Admin
- The KMS server might be down, more servers will be included in future releases
- Make sure you have the proper KMS key that you need installed, more keys and auto OS detection will be added in future releases
- Getting error saying something about non-core, you're inserting a key not for your version
- Do not use a proxy"

,xpmule,2012-08-20T22:48Z,"LOL enjoy the windows cracks of the pirate bay.

Do I troll windows 8 topics ?
Nope.
I have posted a TON of helpfull information so you are talking out your ass.

Calling me kid ? I guarantee I'm older than almost everyone of the little P2P noobs that loiter around at TPB.
This place is a known Noob magnet !

Do I work for Microsoft ?
Ya uhh i guess the software i cracked and uploaded to TPB was while i was on my break at work right ?

And i don't think skulls mean shit.
I can think of a bunch of people that have had some ultra dumb behavior and i can post their names and examples if you guys really want.

Hey think whatever you want..
All i know is downloading dumb cracks from noobs that refuse to give credit for their uploads is a bad idea.
The procedure is common here.. Downlaod crap from anywhere and remove all traces of the original cracker etc and then upload to TPB and rinse and repeat. Why this is bad should be painfully obvious lol

I miss places like sharereactor and the old days people seemed waaaaay smarter back then. i swear to god p2p users get dumber by the hour !

Oh and the -8 votes were not from me so consider that i may be the only one with the balls to speak up but i'm not the only one voting BAD on the many versions of this tool he has uploaded.. go and search for the other versions and read the comments ;)"
,Barrytoo,2012-08-21T00:24Z,"Come on guys calm down all this isn't necessary at all!
I also still didn't activate my Windows 8 but this because all servers are down.
If I'm lucky enough to catch one up I'll be done with this crack like other users :)
The crack only will activate Windows when an Activation server is caught running so it is sometimes useless & sometimes useful
@xpmule & others....no need for all this thing."

,teo32,2012-08-22T23:19Z,"Hi, you can enter new codes to Windows 8 Pro?"
,DrKamBosha,2012-08-23T23:54Z,"@samubra
with all my deep respect, we have to face this :
Even if all your 3 copies got activated, it's a take it and run away way game, in other words, once many people start to activate using a particular serial, it soon gets blocked & using the very same serial again to activate your 3 copies won't work. For me i got 8 installed, all drivers fine, but cloned my system partition, & till i can see something reliable (like DAZ) i can't depend on it yet, Now i'm stuck with windows 7 till things get better :)"
,kodos44,2012-08-23T23:59Z,"it shows an error ""filename directory name or syntax incorretct""

what can I do?"
,fpr8653,2012-08-24T11:21Z,"if this ""activate by phone"" really works, then why doesn't anyone post the serial key with the confirmation code they received so we can all use it? I think that's only fair......."
,willbe1,2012-08-25T09:39Z,"@fpr8653 the confirmation code will be different with each machine, so if I gave you the code here it will definitely not work on your machine as you may have different hardware than mine on it."
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-26T00:31Z,"for activation by phone you got to do a clean install first and activate it before connecting to any internet available in order to work. changing key will not do any good once you go online because internet will ruin your installation ID. only go online when you had it activated first. it added up sence while phone activation is ultimately designed for offline computers.

to see something like DAZ activator is nearly very impossible for windows 8. I dont expect it a lot other than standalone KMS emulation like ""office 2010 KMS"" it may be possible.

DrKamBosha you are wrong MAK key is genuine and it was stand for multiple activation key so it doesn't matter if 1million people uses the same key as long as they were activated and once activated they are genuine in the first place."
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-26T01:25Z,if you are not living in western this shit isn't going to work for you!!
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-26T09:27Z,it has been a long cold day in hell before any sign of standalone KMS activator for windows 8. this kind of online Kms server activation will never to work if you are not living in the west!!!!
,DrKamBosha,2012-08-27T02:41Z,"@FuckSholihin So do any of these serials is meant for mass-activation, in other words, is there any serial around that is a volume license key ? & what difference does it make in my location ? I'm not getting what does it matter in ?
Sorry for asking alot
best wishes to u all"
,DrKamBosha,2012-08-27T02:42Z,"@FuckSholihin mmmm do u mean those 2 serials in the first post by bobiras himself ?
Sorry again for being repetitive ;-)"
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-27T05:17Z,"ok i copy paste thing text and hope you'll understand your question:

VIP thethingy at 2012-08-25 03:09 CET:
""xpmule, dude, each and every mak key has x amount of online activations and x amount of phone activations then it dies or is reset, an office one I posted had 30,000 online activations then after they got used it got reset again but another one just died, at the end of the day no one thats been mak activated has ever been deactivated and if MS did not want to phone activate they would simply ask the name of the key holder, they dont so they clearly dont care so you are making quite a mountain out of a molehill.

What is this letter from isp bullshit?, MS dont get your ip over the phone because you aren't using the internet and once mak activated no further activation checks are performed so your scare story is for what?

The risks are quite simply they tell you they aren't activating it and thats all, you are never asked your name even if you talk to an operator so what is with the scaremongering?""


it's been quite a mass activation but not really a mass activation since M$ keeps monitoring the amount of activation being made until it exceeses it's own limitation by M$. like thethingy said some keys gotten reseted and some gone dead. MAK method exists because M$ paranoid with xp experience (xp VL doesnt require any activation)."
,DrKamBosha,2012-08-27T16:13Z,@FuckSholihin Thanks for the feedback Bro.
,paimit,2012-08-28T10:05Z,anybody pliz help me...what is the first six installation ID ? in phone activation.
,fndpena,2012-08-30T04:31Z,Any new product keys? I tried to activate by phone with some keys from the last list (page 2) and no success :(
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-31T19:04Z,it only works by calling uk number.
,FuckSholihin,2012-08-31T19:10Z,all ye licensee if ye plan to buy ye should only buy from valid/authorised licensor only.
,enigmaelectronica,2012-09-07T01:36Z,not work!!!
