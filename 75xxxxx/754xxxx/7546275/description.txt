In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews J.S Kim from smartknowledgeu.com. He talks about the Asian economies and precious metal currencies, as well as plans by Germany to force European nations to use their gold reserves as collateral. J.S Kim has an undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania and two master degrees (a Master in Public Policy and a Master in Business Administration) from the University of Texas at Austin. In 2005, dissatisfied with the ethics of the commercial investment industry, J.S. Kim left the corporate world behind to launch SmartKnowledgeU.com.
