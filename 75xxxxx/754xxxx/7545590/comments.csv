,cybergodsig,2012-08-19T21:11Z,the au20 cd's sound amazing
,cybergodsig,2012-08-19T21:29Z,Please help me seed so I can bring you more
,hal4000,2012-08-30T14:24Z,"Cybergodsig, please first finish seeding a torrent before uploading anything else. What you are doing here is ridiculous. I suppose your bandwidth isn't the best around but you can't expect people to seed anything if there's nothing to seed. Just one question. Are you thick? Please STOP uploading anything new. DON'T UPLOAD!!! First SEED!!! FINISH all your old torrents first!!! Really hope you understand now."
,tverlaine,2012-09-01T17:39Z,"Thanks for the excellent music.The sound is superb,especially for me 'Hot Rats' Due to not being someone who can upload I can only do my part by seeding.Although I wasn't to happy the way most of your uploads were going or more like not going.I do see you are trying to amend that.'Shit happens' for all of us with no one being exempt,so for me the slate is clean on the past and looking forward to any more of you excellent uploads.For now fingers crossed lol. Thanks again."
,luisgfg,2012-09-01T19:09Z,Don't wast your time. This is not 24k! As it's supposed to.
,cybergodsig,2012-09-01T20:44Z,"Were In It For The Money, Apostrophe, and One Size Fits All are gold discs.  I forgot to include audiochecker files.  They are 100% CDDA.  Check yourself with foobar,Tau, or Audiocheker.  "
,tverlaine,2012-09-02T17:15Z,"Meant to write 'One size fits all' in my previous post.Only excuse is old age I guess.,anyway 'Hot Rats' original vinyl is unbeatable imho,but I do like the ryko gold here,especially 'One size' Thanks again cybergodsig uploads are moving right along now."
