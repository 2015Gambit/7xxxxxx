,Kole97,2012-08-20T17:19Z,"Thanks, so, this season is over! Can't get enough of it."
,tflagger997,2012-08-21T00:59Z,"No, it is just another 42 minute episode.  It will seem longer, with less drama and some actual movement just like S1.  Lets just hope that whatever is developed will actually be used in S3 and not discarded with half the cast (again)."
,tflagger997,2012-08-21T01:54Z,"What is going on with this torrent?  10+ Seeds with Availability of 10+ and only 4 peers yet the speed is averaging about 15 kb/s!  Only two of the Seeds is actually seeding, and that is barely at all.

Can leechers hide themselves from the Peers list?"
