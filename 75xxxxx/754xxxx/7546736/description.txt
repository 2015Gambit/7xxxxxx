What's Stars! all about?
-----------------------------------------------------
Stars! is the only full-blown interstellar strategy game for Microsoft
Windows that's fast-paced and simple to play while allowing you to carry out
complex and clever strategies. You'll build starships, discover and colonize
new planets, research new technologies, manage the essential elements of
world economies, defend your empire and (no guarantees here) destroy all
your enemies. One or more people can play, on a single machine, across a
network, over modems, email or computer bulletin boards.  Complex computer
players are available for both single and multi player games.
