* Note for episodes 1, 4, 21, 22 from S2: for each episode four files are present

	TSCC - s02exx - TITLE...

These files contain only the episode, starting from where the episode starts, and with a single audio track.

	TSCC - s02exx - TITLE (episode only, dual audio - requires PRE for the whole commentary)...

Like the previous, but with a second audio track for the audio commentaries.
They require the "PRE" files to watch the episode with the whole audio commentaries.
They can be merged with the "PRE" files using mkvmerge or another software.

	TSCC - s02exx - TITLE - PRE (first seconds, only needed for the commentary)...

These files contain the first seconds of the track (opening titles and the "summary of the previous episodes").
They're not needed to watch the episode, but they contain the first seconds of the audio commentary in their second audio track.

	TSCC - s02exx - TITLE - WITH Commentary and OP (dual audio)...

These files contain everything: two audio tracks (episode + commentary) and a complete video track which includes the opening titles, the "summary of the previous episodes" part and the episode.
They have two chapters.
See "Note for EPs 01, 04, 21, 22.txt" for details.
