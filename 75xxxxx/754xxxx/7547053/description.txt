Part 4 : Hawaiian Monk Seals - Surviving Paradise 

The northwest Hawaiian Islands are a wildlife paradise.A string of tiny atolls and islands, almost a thousand kilometers from civilization, they are a refuge for almost thirty species of sea birds, endangered green sea turtles and a true 'living fossil', the Hawaiian monk seal. Seemingly sheltered in the clear waters of remote atolls, this oldest living seal's tiny numbers keep it always on the brink of extinction. From land to sea, from the rich shallows to the dark trenches, explore the unique web of life that sustains - or kills - some of the last tropical seals on earth.
