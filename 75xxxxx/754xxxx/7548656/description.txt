*** THE NEXT GENERATION OF NAVIGATION: iGO primo app IS HERE ***

iGO primo app is powered by the same tried-and-trusted iGO Engine used in millions of GPS navigation devices around the world: faster & more reliable than ever before, with a set of new features for a more intelligent navigation.



HOW IT WORKS
Select your destination - either by searching for an address, a place of interest, or by picking a spot on the map. Our Smart keyboard and Smart search make it easy.
iGO primo app calculates the route to your chosen destination and displays a map overview along with the most important information, such as journey distance and estimated travel time. Just tap Go! and iGO primo app guides you to your destination with clear voice guidance and a smoothly moving 3D map.
Visit iGO My way - Global Navigation Software for more details and the complete feature list, and to see iGO primo app in action.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP
Please note that since iPod touch and iPad (WiFi only) do not have built-in GPS-receivers, an external GPS-receiver is required. Compatible are only those which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application via iTunes.

Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on - you can do this under Settings / Advanced settings.
