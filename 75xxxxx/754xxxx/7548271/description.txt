
BBC Proms 2012 - 26. Bach - Mass in B minor

Having restored choral music to the forefront of his ensemble's recent activities, Baroque specialist Harry Bicket returns to the Proms hotfoot from the 2012 Leipzig Bachfest with one of music's great milestones.

Since its rediscovery by 19th-century Romantics, Bach's Mass in B minor has been continually reimagined, most recently with an injection of period-style agility and buoyancy. Still the mysteries remain, as befits a testament through which the composer seemingly intended to carve out his unique place in cultural history.
