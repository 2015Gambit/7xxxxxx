Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) enrolls in the surgical residency program at Seattle Grace Hospital, where she will spend the next 7 years. Hours into the program, Meredith discovers that a stranger she had a one-night-stand with is her new boss, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), a cardiothoracic surgeon in the hospital begins to question his abilities, and decides to choose George (T.R. Knight) to perform the first operation, which earns him the nickname 007.
