,saffronsghost,2012-08-19T07:31Z,Fake I'm guessing?  Didn't it just start 30 minutes ago?
,jpfan,2012-08-19T07:36Z,I was there. That shit was over quick.
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-19T07:59Z,Was supposed to end at 12:45. It ended at 12:13 and i uploaded it at 12:19. It went by very fast. They could have added two more fights to the entire card.
,SixPigeons,2012-08-19T08:08Z,"I've only got a partial download so far: figher intros and such, but it looks legit."
,mindseyedigital,2012-08-19T08:18Z,fake?
,Dezroy,2012-08-19T08:20Z,Thanks for the spoilers you cunts.
,saffronsghost,2012-08-19T08:22Z,"Ah, great job then, can't even find it anywhere else yet which made me think fake also.  Great job, getting it now  :)"
,saffronsghost,2012-08-19T08:24Z,And lol @ spoilers.  Fast could mean anything.
,Chazk,2012-08-19T08:24Z,That better not be a spoiler mofo
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-19T10:40Z,"Why are people saying spoiler? Because some said it ended fast? That doesn't mean anything. No worries. It just ended pretty soon compared to the scheduled time.

And my torrents are never fake. I'm a frequent uploader, so no worries.

Enjoy."
,solmyr,2012-08-19T11:09Z,Seed please :)!!
,luke444,2012-08-19T11:18Z,"Seed you cocksucking leechers, SecTPG is legit"
,amisegaa,2012-08-19T11:27Z,Where is seed .... 
,rueyaruru,2012-08-19T11:49Z,"Seed, please!"
,amisegaa,2012-08-19T12:22Z,"89 seeders
shame on all of u "
,pitbeals,2012-08-19T12:28Z,"praying for another upload...at it for hours, but thankfully it should be complete in just under 16 more!  :)"
,warheart209,2012-08-19T13:02Z,Thanks but the fighters on this card aren't really worth more than 1 GiG. 
[V],spastik64,2012-08-19T13:20Z,"Good Job, anyway I feel you're bitrate is excesive (20,000 kbps) just for video."
,noz666,2012-08-19T16:08Z,"OP why do you post such huge bitrates?
60 FPS makes no sense all this stuff is filmed and broadcast at 24/25 FPS, you're just doubling frames.
If you get the scoop on a show and you drop behind because it's 5GB it's a bit pointless.
Thanks anyway, I'll seed even if I have the new uploads faster probably ;) "

,SubJunk,2012-08-19T17:46Z,noz666: MMA is usually broadcast at 60FPS (groups like LMAO and C4TV release them like that while KYR halves the framerate) and recorded at something like 240FPS which allows them to display smooth framerates in slowed replays.
,noz666,2012-08-19T20:55Z,"I stand corrected, apologies, that's why the image looks so unreal.
still this bitrate is much too high."
,Rush,2012-08-19T22:55Z,"If you have a older cpu/gpu (like mine) this may not play smoothly (very high bitrate)

quality is outstanding though but have to pass thanx for the upload."
,titikab88,2012-08-19T23:13Z,"can't you read? it's VBR meaning it's variable. and it's written that the overall bitrate is 5 859 Kbps. sometimes, you just have to read."
,mentallyours,2012-08-20T00:29Z,y is it your uploads hav alot of seeders but take forever to download? people suk again lol. that nepotu fukers uploads r fast as lightning to download even with no seeders. aint that sum shit?
[T],SecTPB,2012-08-20T06:15Z,"@spastik64 
20mbps is the ""Maximum Bitrate."" It's VBR not CBR. The bitrate never gets that high. If it did, you certainly wouldn't have only a 5GB file. VBR(Variable Bitrate) means the bitrate changes according to what's being processed by the video. Faster scenes full of action require a higher bitrate than scenes that don't move, so to maintain quality it changes, where as CBR(Constant Bitrate) stays steady at one single bitrate throughout the whole video. 

@mentallyours
People may be limiting their upload speed, blocking it all together, or have bad upstream, so they can't provide as much as they take.

@noz666
Almost everything my cable provider broadcasts is in 60FPS. The bitrate is not that high either(Read reply to spastik64). I also don't encode. I cap. All I can do is limit the bitrate of the broadcast as it's being made into a transport stream file on my computer. Read the description to this file for the bitrate of the video.

@Rush
This user is correct. 60FPS is a lot to process, so weak computer systems will not be able to handle it properly. Sure, there may be ways to get it to work better though, if you know what you're doing. Look for an SD or HD copy later with half the framerate if your system cannot handle the quality and fluidity of my releases.

@titikab88
Thank you for explaining and reading. :)

----

You're not going to get better quality than my stuff. I can make this even better and release it in 1080i TS if I wanted to, but decided more people would benefit from a lower bitrate and resolution so a wider audience can watch. :)"
,Rush,2012-08-20T08:26Z,"@titikab88..... yeah moron... don't care wtf its called, already tried to play, herky jerky maxed out 100% cpu ...... cant you read ?

I can handle 720p hd fine , this one is too much for older systems, if you have a faster computer.. like i said the quality is second to none.

SecTPB.... once again thanks for the up, had to go with a lesser quality for fluid video though.
