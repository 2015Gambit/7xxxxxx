Hoke Colburn sits in the front seat with his hands on the steering wheel, but the the driver's seat is behind him.  That's where Miss Daisy sits.  She doesn't want a chauffeur and she wont give in.  Neither will Hoke.

Alfred Uhry's moving Pulitzer Prize winning play became 1989's Academy Award winning Best Picture.  Driving Miss Daisy tells of genteel but strong willed Atlanta matron Daisy and her patient but equally determined chauffeur Hoke.  For two so different, they have a lot in common.  And the bumpy road they travel leads to the friendship of a lifetime.
