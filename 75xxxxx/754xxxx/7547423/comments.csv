,yakirvo,2012-08-19T17:14Z,"momsson@

1.25"
[T],azaq318,2012-08-19T17:18Z,It is compressed. Real though.
,R4G333,2012-08-19T17:24Z,I hope It's not FAKE.
,momsson,2012-08-19T18:11Z,"https://store.eu.square-enix.com/emea_europe/pc-windows-download/FINAL-FANTASY-VII.php
-> 2280MB

I'm downloading here just the iso, don't know how an iso can be so compressed."
[T],azaq318,2012-08-19T18:55Z,"momsson

Let me tell you.

First, i compressed game data - files, folders etc...

After, I just put compressed files inside iso image.

That simple."
,thecats2011,2012-08-19T19:23Z,the torrent is real but the game sucks . bad graphics . 
,iShadowx,2012-08-19T19:27Z,"Finnaly finish downloading currently installing 

But does this need any serial or other?"
,momsson,2012-08-19T19:30Z,"Well thank you sir for clarify this.

But did it really need the Spam Desktop Icon to cat-a-cat?! "
,jbysmith,2012-08-19T19:36Z,"Seems to be working just fine, thanks.  Slightly disappointed they didn't add widescreen support, but otherwise running nicely in Win7."
,iShadowx,2012-08-19T19:39Z,"This does require a serial did i messed up somewhere? if Yes please tell me where ...

in your description it said to be ""crack"" by vovan"

I even didn't block my internet."
,Sothar,2012-08-19T21:48Z,"Here is My question about this torrent. Is this version set up so that I can play it on a lap top? What I mean when I say this is, my lap top does not have a ten key number pad, can I still play it correctly? I have downloaded a ton of patches for the other versions that are out there, and NONE of them will let Me get past the scene where you start the fight with rufus. the reason for this is that in order to start that fight you have to press the [START] button. with no ten pad I cannot press that button, as it does not exist in a way that the computer recognizes. Am I going to have this problem with this version as well??"
,Sothar,2012-08-19T22:01Z,ok let Me try this again since it seems My comment poofed. can this version of the game be played on a lap top that does not have a 10-key number pad?
,Joohnnyboy87,2012-08-20T00:38Z,"works great, i installed and played and it works!"
,DMCbr,2012-08-20T01:21Z,"works 99%, need login to save setings, then joystick will work(~maybe~). but comom! is FF7 with DX9 support! we waiting for that for like... 15 years? less rage, more play!"
,stimmy99,2012-08-20T02:28Z,Game asks for serial - using win XP.  IT DEFINITELY ASKS FOR SERIAL.  This game is not cracked.  When you hit play it contacts square servers and you get activation notice.
,GObonzo,2012-08-20T09:28Z,"if you are so stupid that you can't run this quit pirating, you're asking for trouble."
,iShadowx,2012-08-20T14:04Z,"DMC actually you have to ignore the message , its says fail to sync with server or w.e ignore and play

anyway is theire any patch to make this multi language?"
,Aoishiro,2012-08-20T14:19Z,i can't seem to save the game. go to a save point to save and it just refuse to save. DMC said that you had to sign in to save? is this true?
,Sothar,2012-08-20T14:51Z,"yes press play everyone go through and do what it says log into either your square enix account or your facebook account then watch it update AND THEN IT TELLS YOU THAT YOU NEED A DOG GONE SERIAL NUMBER 

AND DONT TELL ME TO PLAY IT OFFLINE BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU TURN AROUND AND HIT PLAY WITH NO INTERNET IT WONT LET YOU PLAY IT HAS TO HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION SO THAT IT CAN TRACK YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS SO WHAT IS THE SERIAL NUMBER SO THAT NICE PEOPLE LIKE ME CAN PLAY THIS GAME "
,Sothar,2012-08-20T17:14Z,"@Aoishiro

How did you get in to play I have clicked play, I have signed in with facebook like it asks you to, and then it asks for activation could you please tell us all how you got around the activation??"
,Aoishiro,2012-08-20T17:29Z,"i have no idea why you can't start the game. i can play it fine actually. i don't sign up or log in or anything. it's just when you run it for the first time, in the top left corner, it says downloading save file, and after a while it says fail to sync and you saved files will be stored locally. but when i get to the first save location, all of the save slot were darkened, and i can't save. "
,Sothar,2012-08-20T17:57Z,yeah I dont get that the very first time I tried to start the game and play it it went straight to a log in page that I couldnt get past untill I signed in with face book after that it went to asking Me for a serial number
,xhizors,2012-08-20T17:58Z,"This is not a remake, it's a re-release... "
,Sothar,2012-08-20T18:50Z,"@xhizors

This is the 2012 HD RELEASE, because they have redone the models and the interface it is considered even by square soft to be a remake "
,Aerionix,2012-08-21T01:33Z,"Works fine, no problems yet but only have played up to the first save point to make sure saves worked.  Alls well, although not sure how to make it save controller configs yet.  Guess it needs the online or a new crack.  or possibly editing a cfg manually.  "
,wagxxx,2012-08-21T02:09Z,"It keeps asking for an activation code guys, with both the launcher and the ff7_en, what should i do?"
,Sothar,2012-08-21T02:55Z,"OK folks Im gonna say this once and people can get pissed off at Me if they want if you find a keygen, and it asks you to go through all kinds of surveys and crap to get it DONT POST IT those things are annoying as hell and for those of us with no credit cards it is impossible to actually complete those offers which in the end only frustrates us more "
,Xenous,2012-08-21T03:11Z,"What I did, is signed in with facebook, and when it asked for serial, I quit. Then fired it back up again, hit play, and it worked.

...you're better off emulating the PS1 version though. This is awful :l"
,adub420,2012-08-21T03:12Z,"not hd. same graphics as the old one. dono what the deal is here, the characters are still blocky and weird looking. thnx for this piece of shit."
,Aerionix,2012-08-21T04:30Z,"Fire up the old one and compare.  The resolution is higher and characters are much sharper.  Yeah the characters still look deformed out of battle and thats what they are supposed to look like.  If people are expecting a remake similar to resident evil for the cube, then they will be disapointed.  If u want an enhanced and bug free pc version of a game u loved back in the day, you'll enjoy this.  

I do recommend replacing the music with some of the custom mods floating around tho.  Or even the original psx tracks.  Its easy and really adds to the game.  Have fun!"
,ShawnyBoy,2012-08-21T05:22Z,"Okay guys, as long as you don't try to login, and just hit play on the first screen you see. It will work with no activation. If you try to use a login, it will ask for an activation code. 

Its working great for me. Only question I have is, can we use the old PC MODS for this version? "
,adub420,2012-08-21T06:14Z,look at the youtube video. towards the end it shows what its supposed to look like at the beginning of play
,cloud7cloud,2012-08-21T06:36Z,works great thx
,alfie03rocks,2012-08-21T08:07Z,this works perfect! great job! will be seeding for as long as i ccan
,fishboy11,2012-08-21T19:21Z,"people having problems saving, you have to wait while on the save screen for it to try to access the network and when that fails it will let you save, it takes a few seconds, and you can save your settings as well, just change them and when your done and it foes to the login screen just close the game and restart it."
,YAGOB,2012-08-22T02:40Z,"@fishboy11

just like you said but there is huge proplem like every final fansy 7 fan know the game is huge you can crack 100 hours of play easly

 so if you are going to wait 15 seconds to be able to save than your life wuold be over before you can finish the game ""it literaly kill the game fan""

what we need is a good crack that dosen't require to even try to access the network

a compolete new exe that would prove who is the real master of cracking and coding"
,YAGOB,2012-08-22T08:20Z,"I found a solution to how fast you can save your game and load game fast

this is for windows 7
1. go to ""Control PanelSystem and SecurityWindows Firewall""
2. from left side corner choose ""Advanced settings""
3. a widow will pop out from left side corner choose ""Outbound Rules""
4. from right corner choose ""New Rule""
5. choose Program ""it's choosen by defalut"" press next
6. Brwose to where you installed the game ""defalut setup destintion is C:Program Files (x86)Square EnixFINAL FANTASY VII"" choose ""ff7_en.exe"" if you play other than english choose the approprite exe
ff7_de.exe for dutch
ff7_en.exe for english
ff7_es.exe for espansh
ff7_fr.exe for fransh
7. after you choose the approprite one press next than choose ""Block the connection"" {again it's choosen by defalut} press next
8. make sure everthing have a cheek {by defalut everthing cheeked} press next
9. choose a name {any name is good better to make it obvious like ""ff7_en.exe""} press finish.

and there you blocked the game from trying to f#@x access the network one more thing

make all these steps again but this time for ""ff7 Updater.exe"" and ""ff7 UpdateHelper.exe""
you can find them in ""Cusers%USERPROFILE%DocumentsSquare EnixFINAL FANTASY VIIupdate-temp""
make sure you Block both files after that every time you try to access the save game screen it will load faster

for all ff7 with love"
