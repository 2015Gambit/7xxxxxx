This time Max and Stacy discuss consumption-tration camps, savers subsidising fraud in the City of London and JP Morgan sacrificing their balance sheet and the US dollar. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to the one and only silver guru, David Morgan of Silver-Investor.com, about shorting bonds and buying silver.
