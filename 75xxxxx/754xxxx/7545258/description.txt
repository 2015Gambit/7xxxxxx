Description:
Player - Sovereign Ardani. Gameplay includes building and hiring heroes to create a sustainable and meet the objectives of the Kingdom of the script.
Heroes (all soldiers-men in the game, except for the palace guards and guards are called heroes) are living their own lives. Orders are not given directly to the heroes, the player is able to offer only the reward (the flag flown the flag attack or reconnaissance) for the head of the enemy, or for the study area. If the reward is large enough, the characters begin to carry out an order. Even an enemy hero can flatter a huge reward. On top of all the characters have different needs: drinking in a tavern, trips to the market, the battle of the tournament, and so on and so forth.
