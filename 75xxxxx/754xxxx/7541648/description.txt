Michael Franti - I know I am not alone - Music Documentary

Musician and political activist Michael Franti journeys to the Middle East to learn about the human costs of political occupation in this documentary. Franti, who has recorded with the groups Spearhead and the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, took a small camera crew to Iraq with the goal of finding out "what it's like to live under foreign military rule," and with his guitar in hand Franti interacts with Iraqi civilians, chatting with people on the street, speaking with folks in their homes, and joining in for performances with local musicians as he interviews them about the differences between life before and after the American invasion of their nation. Franti also visits American forces stationed in Iraq, wanting to know how the war and occupation has impacted their lives. Later Franti journeys to Israel, speaking to ordinary people and military figures as well as Palestinians in search of similar insights on this long simmering conflict. I Know I'm Not Alone was Franti's debut as a film director.
