Scott interviews Tim Kelly of the Future of Freedom Foundation, author of the recent article, "The MAD Myth," about the Mutually-Assured-Destruction paradigm.

Scott also discusses at length a recent article by Glenn Greenwald at Salon, "The Sham Terrorism Expert Industry." An excellent read!

And, Scott announces big changes for The Scott Horton Show. His show will continue to air on the Liberty Radio Network, but beginning Monday his live broadcast will be on the No Agenda Stream. The show will be shortened from three hours to two, and he expressed his intention to follow the No Agenda business model of listener support only with no commercials [at least during the live broadcast]. I got the impression that he may insert commercials into a la Jack Blood. My hope is that he won't bend the rules like Jack and start sneaking them into the live show. But I'm sure he'll do what he needs to do to keep going, and I have editing software.
