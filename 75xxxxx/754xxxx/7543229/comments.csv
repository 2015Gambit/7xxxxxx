,arte123,2012-08-18T12:05Z,FAKE!!! Seed stops at 99.9%. File not playable. Do not download!
,Greyhaime,2012-08-18T12:51Z,"Was not able to connect to any peer that had 100%

Tons and tons of peers had 99.9%"
,solidsam22,2012-08-18T13:09Z,Scenebalance is turd
,com8472,2012-08-18T13:10Z,"^^ Confirmed, I'm blacklisting this uploader."
,tanifa,2012-08-18T13:18Z,^ Same.  :(   I was SO looking forward to seeing Bill after such a long hiatus too!  :( 
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2012-08-18T13:31Z,WTF scenebalance? 
,Kilroy222,2012-08-18T13:42Z,"Nothing ever downloads and if it does, it's never 100%... don't even bother with scenedance / scenetime..."
,BoonesFerry,2012-08-18T14:02Z,"Some of you are ignorant. 
scenebalance has a VIP green skull icon for a reason. They earned it. Scenebalance has provided thousands of quality torrents. Go away and get your learn on before making a fool of yourselves. If you're having trouble with this one torrent, or any other video torrent, not getting past 99% simply stop the torrent, find the downloaded file, change the file extension to avi (or whatever the torrent description says the file is) and it should play fine....most of the time. "
,oppression80,2012-08-18T14:13Z,"torrent is trash,,do not bother,,was not expecting this from scenebalance,,,never dealing with u again fuktard"
,BoonesFerry,2012-08-18T15:08Z,"Yikes! I need to retract half of what i previously wrote. at 99%, stopping, renaming to avi, video would not play in vlc. Odd, since this often solves the issue. In any case I still support scenebalance for as long as they maintain the green skull vip member status. 

Btw, you can get this file from torrenday.com, if you're a member. It downloaded 100% in about three minutes and it plays without error. "
,Babygeorge,2012-08-18T15:31Z,"Indeed the file doesn't play...
Can anybody upload an AVI version of the show please? 
Thank you...
=)"
,puunjab,2012-08-18T17:38Z,"It doesn't play if you stop at 99% because literally, the very first chunk of the file is what we are all missing. That has the data that ""explains"" the AVI structure for this particular file. Bittorrent doesn't download in order and for some reason the first chunk is what we didn't get.

This torrent is 2258 pieces with 262 KB in each piece. If it was a chunk in the middle you'd have a minor video drop out, but it would play. The fact it is the first chunk screws us all unless it is properly seeded.

The real fucking problem is with the PirateBay tacker claiming we have 56 seeders. If we did we would already all have this file. 

STOP THE LIES."
,d.e.penn,2012-08-18T17:49Z,also stuck at 99.9%.  Blech
,drhank,2012-08-18T19:18Z,"Something was definitely wrong with this torrent.  It never showed as connecting to ANY seeds.  It only completed to 99.9%, both the torrent and the main avi file.  None of the 3 small files, incl. the NFO were available.  Like BoonesFerry, I went to Torrentday (TD).  However, what I did was to download the NFO, move the incomplete avi file from this torrent to the TD torrent directory, do a recheck with utorrent, and then quickly complete the file with TD.  The quality is VG.  So in regards to arte123's comment, it doesn't appear that the file was 'fake.'  I copied the two completed files back to this torrent and did a recheck, hoping to be able to seed the 100% complete avi to others stuck.  Yet after the recheck, the torrent only recognized the avi as 99.9% (still incomplete), nor did it recognize the NFO (perhaps altered by Scenetime to add their verbage).  Continued seeding for a while, but as completion to others seemed hopeless, ended the torrent and deleted the copied files.  Anyhow, any of you who got the 99.9% file should be able to complete it by downloading the comparable torrent for AFG from a private torrent site, starting the torrent and getting the NFO, doing a recheck after moving the old avi, and then completing a small amount left."
[V],err0001,2012-08-19T00:50Z,I think I managed to fix it.
,drhank,2012-08-19T01:26Z,"I confirmed what err0001 said.  I copied the main avi file to the torrent directory, did a relocate, and started the torrent and connected.  I then set the NFO to download, connected to seeds, and it downloaded.  Set the avi and other 2 small files to download and torrent completed to 100%.  Avi file is same size as copy completed via TD.  Plays fine.  Torrent is all fixed.  Incremented Quality counter.  Thank err0001 and also for your many uploads incl. two eps. of Human Target."
[V],err0001,2012-08-19T01:35Z,"drhank had the right idea. But it sounds like he only had the nfo and avi files. To get to 100%, all 4 files in the torrent were needed. I was able to get those files from another scenebalance torrent and voila!"
