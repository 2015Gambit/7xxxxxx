By the way I get really slow performance with ToR in general.  A 20mb gmail upload attachment that takes ~3 mins regular takes a little over 20 minutes through TOR.  Browsing about the same."
,CCnOSnBT,2012-08-19T15:04Z,"Bundle Changelog:
* Update Tor to 0.2.2.38
* Update NoScript to 2.5
* Update HTTPS Everywhere to 2.1

Tor 0.2.2.38 fixes a rare race condition that can crash exit relays; fixes a remotely triggerable crash bug; and fixes a timing attack that could in theory leak path information.
