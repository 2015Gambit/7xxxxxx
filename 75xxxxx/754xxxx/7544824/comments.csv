,wdc1,2012-08-20T22:00Z,where are the screens?
,dWdHELLCAT,2012-08-21T04:19Z,is there a 1080p version?? this 720p is just ok
,Powerslave0,2012-08-22T05:21Z,"I did not get any Derezing anywhere in this movie; converted with MKV2VOB for use on PS3, perfect through and through.  

Also, this is an animated version, and the acting sucks...  It's way too cliche', and the profane dialog is just off the cuff, no intent or purpose, they curse just to curse.  They tried to make it like the real ones, but it doesn't cut it.   Don't waste your time on a high rez version, get a 1GB or so version, it isn't worth the bandwidth.

Also, there is a 700MB version around here, no audio on PC or PS3."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-23T18:33Z,Excellent! I enjoyed it.
,Analton,2012-08-26T07:25Z,"If you enjoyed the books this movie will not disapoint you. 
I just watched the 700mb version that is right here on TPB and now i want this on HD ;)

Great movie, thanks for the upload!"

Bad movie, bad story, waste of time.   Not worth an hour of your time.
