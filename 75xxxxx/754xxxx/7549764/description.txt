ExtremeCopy Pro - a program that allows you to significantly improve the performance of operations to copy files and folders on Windows. According to the manufacturer, the application will move and copy files to a 20-120% faster than is possible by means of its own. 

Key features of the application: 
- Extremely fast copying and moving files. 
- The possibility of setting up a process to pause and later resume. 
- Calculate and display the exact time remaining until the end of the copy.
