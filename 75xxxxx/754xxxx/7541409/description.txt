Popular historian Herman (How the Scots Invented the World, 2001) dramatizes the end of BritainΓÇÖs rule of India through the lives of Mohandas Gandhi and Winston Churchill. The barrister met the politician once, in 1906, and each manΓÇÖs subsequent relation to the issue of independence, up to its realization in 1947, guides HermanΓÇÖs narrative. The tenor of the authorΓÇÖs presentation is that both Gandhi and ChurchillΓÇÖs visions of IndiaΓÇÖs future were illusory, and bear some blame for the convulsions of 1947 (partition, communal violence, and a Pakistani-Indian war). 

Rooted in his youthful experiences in India, ChurchillΓÇÖs stout imperialism became an ever more impractical stance as GandhiΓÇÖs advocacy of independence gained momentum over the decades. Descriptive about the latterΓÇÖs revered methods of nonviolence, Herman discerns an implied forcefulness behind them should, for example, a Gandhi fast touch off riots. If uncomplimentary toward GandhiΓÇÖs political acumen, Herman presents his criticisms subtly, without impeding the brisk narrative flow. Showing history eluding Gandhi and Churchill, Herman provocatively presents their efforts to shape it.
