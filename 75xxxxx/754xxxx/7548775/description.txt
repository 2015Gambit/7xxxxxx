3 For 1 are three individuals who have chosen to sing for Christ. Holly Robinson-Blanton, Valerie Blanton and Jim Leonard have dedicated the ministry of their music. As soloists they have sung all over America for the past ten or more years, but ten years ago God led them to team up their efforts in the formation of 3 For 1. In late 1996, Pastor Bill Kenny of Crater View Baptist Church in Petersburg, VA decided to have a concert at his church featuring young artists. He scheduled Holly and original group members, Brad Hudson and Trenton Wood for the event. While getting sound checks before the concert Pastor Kenny asked Holly, Brad and Trenton to sing a song together. They worked out some arrangements on three songs and performed them that evening for the first time. As a result of this performance 3 for 1 was born.
