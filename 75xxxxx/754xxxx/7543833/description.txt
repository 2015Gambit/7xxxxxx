Learning from our racial past is crucial to addressing AmericaΓÇÖs current ethnic issues, but only if we confront key contradictions in our shared history. In a conversation with Bill Moyers, Khalil Muhammad helps bring these issues to light. Muhammad heads the New York Public LibraryΓÇÖs ;;Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and is the author of ;;The Condemnation of Blackness, which connects American histories of race, crime and the making of urban America to modern headlines.
