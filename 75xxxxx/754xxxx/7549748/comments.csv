,.Leto.,2012-08-20T08:39Z,"lol, the BluRay will only be released in 1 month. so this is a fake of course."
,seed2all,2012-08-20T08:47Z,its a real one don't trust me start your download
,sharpshot94549,2012-08-20T08:59Z,"considering the dvd quality rips are out, and legit, this seems like it is the next step, but i will wait for the regular sized 720p, these smaller 720p files never have the same quality"
,seed2all,2012-08-20T09:00Z,this is real
,punk420,2012-08-20T09:18Z,"""DVD POSTER"" BRrip.jpg  ?

If you're gonna rename the files, do it right..."
,moshster,2012-08-20T09:22Z,"Real, but looks terrible due to low bitrate for such a small filesize, film is over 2 horus long.  Needs to be at 2GB for viewable quality.  This looks okay on a mobile phone size screen."
,seed2all,2012-08-20T09:26Z,hmmmmmmm
,adstylez,2012-08-20T09:37Z,where r the screenshots then?
,BloodKil_,2012-08-20T10:23Z,"720p and 700mb = low bitrate and shit quality

Torrent may or may not be real, but if your looking for 720p or higher dont waste your time on something small in size like this look for 4gb+ at least"
,JeffCC,2012-08-20T16:28Z,fake. AVI file and 640x226 Resolution. Fucking uploader mother fucker
,capitan_hook,2012-08-20T19:10Z,"hei kids use your brain for once, a 2hrs movie into a 700mb file of course its going to be pixel land"
