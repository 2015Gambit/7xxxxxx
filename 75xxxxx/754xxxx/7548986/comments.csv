NOTES:

Ok took the italian video ...cleaned it up some,there was loads of camera movement all over the place
so cut into several parts and pull and cropped the borders the best we could.
Also changed the normal stuff ...contrast,colours etc...
The perspective goes off aswell as the AR due too the movement but we wanted too crop as little as poss.
Video also missing a little over 2mins....

Audio was nice but contained alot of noise,which we cleaned then syncd too our encode .

Ps ...we dedot when asked,but considering you left some in yourself i'd look in the mirror first and call yourself 
a ****,then go back and check your "" the watch "" aswell ;-)"
