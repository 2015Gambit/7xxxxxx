,Crazydrax,2012-08-19T19:51Z,"Thanks for the update, couldn't find a torrent for it."
,carbonerodecano,2012-08-19T20:44Z,Seed people come on!!
,fadmos,2012-08-19T20:49Z,"@11770 looks like you got the game to work.

i downloaded the: 
""Sleeping Dogs DVD MULTI6-STEAM"" torrent.

then i downloaded the:
""Sleeping Dogs - v1.4 - 3DM Crack Only"" crack

i am now downloading your file.

i assume i

1) install patch.
2) install game.
3) copy paste crack.

but it wont install without a keycode, how am i meant to copy the crack before installing to skip the part where it asks you for the keycode?"
,fadmos,2012-08-19T20:59Z,??
,STROON,2012-08-19T21:20Z,@fadmos you have it the wrong way round install the patch crack then install the game (:
,fadmos,2012-08-19T21:27Z,thanks
,popacific,2012-08-19T21:56Z,@fadmos i guess you need to unlock the files using phoenix since you have the locked version. So its better if you download the unlocked version :) 
,yakirvo,2012-08-19T22:04Z,"PEpole SEED
if not your a fucking NOOB
im in 0.5 !!!!!!!!!!!!! WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"
,mandruf,2012-08-19T22:50Z,This is so slow ....... please seed.
,mandruf,2012-08-19T22:52Z,"The stupid idiot who uploaded this torrent stopped seeding, it's stuck at 46% since hours now. Fcking noobs wanting to make torrents and then go to bed earlier like little faggots."
,mandruf,2012-08-19T22:58Z,"@ fadmos

Is your brain damaged ?

How the hell do you install a patch before installing the game ? WTF ?

I thought these basic maneuvers were just common sens, but I guess some peoples are just too retarded.

-Install your game (and decrypt using phoenix if you have locked version)
-Apply 1.4 patch
-Apply crack over freshly patched game"
,fadmos,2012-08-19T23:47Z,"@mandruf. fuck you stop bitching about everything.

fuks i supposed to know what type of file this is. theres another torrent out there with a crack and 1.4 already in it or some shit apparantly its just install and play no messing around. im just gona go ahead with that. FUCK phoenix "
,11770,2012-08-20T05:53Z,"@ mandruf 
i didn't go 2 sleep i went to the fair ... but i made sure there were other seeders besides myself b4 i left. its only 11:53 over here..."
,11770,2012-08-20T06:38Z,"also fadmos listen to you do need phoenix like mandruf says if u dl'ed that 1 u cant unless you decrypt it with that, p.s. where do u get that from mandruf?"
,Srsbznz,2012-08-20T08:40Z,"How am I supposed to use this patch? I took all the files and pasted them into the instal directive and overrode everything. Then I applied the crack from .Dood. and ran the game.

It still says version 1.3, the cutscenes are bugged are bugged and my character is invisible and the camera is a pain to control. I believe these issues were fixed in 1.4 and seeing as I still have those and it even says 1.3 something tells me this patch didn't work."
,GB16,2012-08-20T16:08Z,It didn`t change the version. Still is version 1.3. Any help? 
,methanphetamine,2012-08-20T18:10Z,anyone managed to get this working ? is it real ?
,Violentos,2012-08-20T22:00Z,"I was hoping this would fix my problem with playing the game. Every 10 seconds of so, the gameplay just freezes up and starts up again 5 seconds later. This update did not solve my problem. I'll have to just wait another week or so for complete package."
,Elefunk,2012-08-20T22:06Z,@11770 Does this even work for you?
,11770,2012-08-20T22:22Z,"i have yet to try this actually; sorry, if it doesnt work i'm going to remove it."
,GB16,2012-08-21T16:03Z,That crap not working. Quite generate more bugs on game. 
,11770,2012-08-21T18:17Z,"yea, i'm sorry but dl this 1 no crack needed its done already...

,logiimouse,2012-08-25T07:37Z,"fake

tried both layer breaks
do not waste your bandwidth and dual layer discs and your time does not work"
,tedwu,2012-08-26T12:16Z,patch is good but only it's 1.3 instead of stated 1.4. My trainer confirms that 100%. Not a big deal but would be nice if the title could be changed so others are not mislead as well.
,olafurhh,2012-08-27T17:16Z,this is version 1.3
,crazysha,2012-09-04T04:26Z,Does it work with blackbox version?
