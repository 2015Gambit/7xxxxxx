Plot:
Vaijhanath Hanpanwar is a small-town guy living in Kalchoudi village near Satara. After the death of his mother, Vaijhya learns that his father Omkar Hanpanwar had left his young wife and three-year old son to earn a living in London. He finds a small box containing several uncashed cheques, flight tickets to London and many little things along with a visiting card. He decides to go there personally and return all the things to his father and come back to India. Meanwhile Omkar, who is a successful businessman in London, learns of Vaijhyas visit to London and decides to win over his son. But first he decides to test his feelings for his father. So Omkar disguises as a van driver, meets Vaijhya and promises to reach him to his fathers residence in Windsor. What follows is a series for funny and interesting incidents that happen in just two days of his visit to London. 

Bharat Jadhav is in the role of Vaijhanath, while Mohan Joshi, in a very different look, plays a rich businessman. He seems to have enjoyed doing this role that even has him dancing to the music along with Bharat. Both have a very good sense of timing. Mrinmayee Lagoo plays Omkars secretary Pooja who helps him in his endeavour to meet his son.
