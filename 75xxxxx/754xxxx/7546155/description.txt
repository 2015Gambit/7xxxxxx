Converted killers mp4 to xvid 360p mp3 cbr 1000bitrate

Ive renamed to align with the last episodes (as per tvrage) 
even if last year I excluded the E09-E10 as specials as well so
the aftershows aligned with the weekly episodes which made mine end on Ep20 
but i can live started these with e22 :)



However its still missing the AFTERSHOW where we would of found out about
where they are heading for Season 3 
alaska or South American?


Oh that poor jungle though :)
