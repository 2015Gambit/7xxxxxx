Source provenance:  1958 recordings released on CD in 1991 consisting of both studio 

and live recordings.  Basically the same lineup as the "Kind of Blue" LP from 

1959, except Wynton Kelly does not participate.  That would be too much to ask 

for.  Ripped via EAC.


It's fun to decide which "horn" is soloing while listening to these tracks.  Is it 

Coltrane's tenor or "cannonball's*" alto.


*Nicknamed cannibal/cannonball because of his prodigious appetite
