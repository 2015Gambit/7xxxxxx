,DeathWaitsForNobody,2012-08-18T22:22Z,i see its from a familiar source. so i know its virus free. i use the same form of one for my copy of KoA:R
,macLife04,2012-08-18T23:33Z,I scanned with AVG and no viruses. When opened up it uses the NUMPAD on a keyboard for all the good things so I cant use this since I bootcamp and my keyboard doesnt have the 10-key. SO fuck! Can't test it.

,DMS1960,2012-08-25T20:02Z,Have only used the infinite health to get past a boss that kept handing me my a$$ but the trainer worked perfectly. Many thanks!
