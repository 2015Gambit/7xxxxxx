Anatharu is a 2007 Kannada film directed by Sadhu Kokila. The film stars Upendra, Darshan, Radhika and Sanghavi. The film was successful mainly due to Upendra's powerful performance which was critically acclaimed. Anatharu was a platform for Upendra to prove his mettle as an actor. Unlike his previous films where he impressed the audience with his unique dilogue delivery, in this film he had to play a character who is dumb by nature.
